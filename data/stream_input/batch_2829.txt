B0050DZN4K|5.0|I have been using Feedly for about 3 months now since the Google reader shut down. So far I like it better and have recommended it to several others. I'm very happy with this app!
B008XG1X18|3.0|hard to pin from non pinning sites. I do like it for browsing when picking my kids up from school etc...
B002WJI63A|5.0|I wouldn't say this is a very durable toy but I don't think these things were intended to be played with.<br />I collect them because I'm a huge Super Mario fan and I like to look at them.<br /><br />From a kid's perspective a kid would want to play with her so I would recommend for the more careful child or the child who knows how to admire the doll on the shelf or nicely play with her.<br /><br />Some people complained about the price and her being too tiny for the 14$ price tag.<br />She's no more expensive than a Barbie or a plush stuffed dog or cat.<br />The quality is very good for $14, very soft and well made.<br /><br />I would be wary of BOOTLEG Mario dolls though. If you see used from China and not the USA beweare.<br />I know there are bootlegs circulating the USA as well, however it is always a CHANCE you take when buying on line. I've gotten a few Bootlegs by accident.<br />HOw to handle it: Carefully assess that the doll is fake.<br />Fake would include:<br />Poor sewing<br />The doll falling apart within a day<br />Stuffing falling out<br />looking over stuffed.<br />Something \\"Strange\\" about it. Misshapped face, head, arm,<br /><br />Check the Tags and check on line for sources<br />Sometimes if you run the barcode through a search engine it will come up as Fake. That's what happens with MIYA Records, a big known Animation/Movie/Game music distributer.<br /><br />IF its a bootleg, report to Amazon and ask for money back<br /><br />Don't support Bootlegs by buying cheap.<br /><br />Bootlegs hurt everyone:<br /><br />The creator/company gets no money from a bootleg sold.<br />Sometimes thos companies go out of business from people buying junk from bootleggers<br />Bootleggers are theives.<br /><br />Bootleggers use SHODDY products. There is no quality control<br />Why is that a problem?<br />Because the items used to make the toy could have harmful chemicals in them that hurt your child or pet. Think about Kids and Pets who put things in their mouths.How easy it could be for them to be poisoned by a shoddy product.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's not like using facebook on a desk top at all. It's more like trying to access it from you phone. I rarely ever use it on my kindle.

B0015T6G2G|4.0|This book is a must read for anyone who wants to work in fighting injustice. Mandela is a storyteller, and does not leave you with an academic feel, but a life story. It is a beautiful tale of forgiveness, struggle, and triumph.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This was a book to be read by my teenaged daughter. She thoroughly enjoyed the book and she is one that does not enjoy reading.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Good story line keeps you coming back for more. I finished the all of wool in less than a week and am now reading shifts. It clears up and complicates the entire story line. I am trying to read a little slower. Love this series.

B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|At first I thought it was dumb but the more I played it I was hooked I would play a lot
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album gives me hope that music can still be made with fidelity. This album is Demo-worthy, with tracks like &#34;Touch&#34; having real orchestral sections and wide dynamic range dropping into the subsonic range. Drums throughout every song are palpable and real sounding. Overall there is no studio compression on any of the songs, so don't go adding any yourself by making Mp3's: google something called &#34;Flac&#34;, or if you're an Apple user, google &#34;Apple lossless&#34; and use that.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I found dragon tattoo a very hard read in the beginning,so I just watched the movie.This second book,remarkable.nonstop action,flowing storyline,loved it.
B000059MEL|5.0|This is my favorite Daft Punk album. Outstanding production. Sounds pristine through each song and is well balanced with highs, mids, and lows.

B00E193TM2|5.0|5FDP fans will love it. A mix of their sound and a return to some of their hard hitting in your face music. A must have for the 5FDP fan!!
B00CFA227C|5.0|This movie is really funny and has great effects.  There were a couple of parts that seemed utterly ridiculous, but overall it's worth watching.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I thought I was getting the game that I play all of the time, I guess it isn't kindle friendly
B003UESJHE|5.0|I love Colin Firth, but I love him even more in this movie.  There is a generous amount of cursing, however, it is actually necessary.  I believe it is worth every penny to buy.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I enjoyed this, though not as much as <u>Gone Girl</u>. It was a little disturbing, and I found it hard to picture what Camille even looked like, since &#60;spoiler&#62; I can't imagine a person with scars of words all over their body. &#60;/spoiler&#62; I thought it was a little predictable, in that I did guess part of the end, but not the entire thing, pretty early on, but I still thought it was an enjoyable read and it was really unique. Sometimes, I think it's okay to have a predictable story as long as it's told in a unique way with good writing that keeps you reading, and that's what this was. Like most mystery/thrillers, it's pretty easy to point to one or two people and say &#34;Aha! You're the killer!&#34; For this genre especially, if my standard was that the book would only be good if it wasn't predictable, I think I'd have to stop reading these books entirely, because I almost always guess who the killer is pretty early in. In any case, I think this was a good book with really interesting characters, and I would recommend it to people who enjoy this genre and who, like me, are okay with guessing what's going to happen without knowing exactly how you'll get there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Friends have been bugging me to get this and i finally did, im so happy, this game is AWESOME unlike the cheap imitations of it like survival craft, that u shouldent buy btw! ANYWAYS this game is awesome and ifu have the money i highly suggest you buy it!!!
B0006HBZXS|5.0|Take any successful CEO: is he just lucky or does he have an edge, some quality that other people are lacking? This an interesting take on the subject. The rich and successful CEO Charles Morse, is played by a larger than life Anthony Hopkins. He has everything: the most power, the most money, the most beautiful wife. Is he loved? We are not sure. The circumstances, an accident that leaves him to prove himself in the Alaskan wilderness, will help you decide if he has \\"the edge\\".<br />It is a brilliant film. Alec Baldwin (playing the photographer of the beautiful trophy wife) is remarkable as a traitor, willing to have it all, the wife and the money. The movie is fascinating and allows quick but deep takes in the psychology of very different characters. I did like that the first quality we find in Charles Morse is that he is curious of everything. He reads a lot, the small things he learns about Alaska will help him. It is an action-packed movie with lots of insights in the characters plus beautiful settings.<br />One of my favorite movies, and one I'll see again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Running minion yeah whoo fun get it yea play fun now play every one get it yea who PLAY yea
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Imagine what kind of movie you would have done with this subject.<br />1) It is hard to make a movie on this subject. Showing changes in the way one picks baseball players while using a new controversial method is bound to show many meetings and discussions as opposed to action. What do you do to avoid this to be a technical documentary? How do you make it so that it is not boring? So the writers decided to add a sentimental bit and to show the unhappy side of people who work too much. They show Billy Beane as a divorced dad. Some reviewers criticize it, but frankly, the movie needed \\"something\\".<br />2) It is a real story about a real club, but one of the principal heroes did not want to be represented in the movie. He was right: once you sell your image, you lose the control over it. It is why we have a little new guy strong in stats who does not know much about sports (the fictional Peter Brand from Yale) instead of the real life Paul DePodesta from Harvard who knew quite a lot.<br />3) Because it is a real life story, you cannot not end the movie the way we all want, with the little guy beating the big guys all the way. The A's last pennant was in 1990 and they lost their funding when owner Walter Haas died in 1995. From there comes the need to find underestimated (cheaper but still good) players. So how do you end the movie? I did not like the final choice, but then, I have nothing better to propose. Brad Pitt fills the screen and appears powerful without snobbery, as he should. The awkward Peter Brand adds a dimension to the film. It kept my interest and I know close to nothing in baseball. I love movies where people are at a disadvantage and crawl back. And I like people who crawl back. This was a good film.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Well u run and jump and stuff if u like this review message me on movie star planet dr p!nk  well u can get but u play 4 20 mins and then another game then it again its kinda fun
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I always liked Vince Gill and Buck and Merle are two of my favorites so when I first heard about this CD I wanted to get it. However, I did have reservations even though Vince is a super talent but to do songs by Buck and Merle?<br />The result is great. Paul Franklin's steel and Vince's vocals and guitar make this one of the best CD's I've bought in the last few years and I buy a lot of CD's.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It good but for the CREATORS they need to add pain a boat a saddle and horses and other animals like survivalcraft
B0091Q3254|5.0|This live DVD is the most frequently seen for past one year, and makes me a big fan of Noel Gallagher. For Oasis fans, the last part is for them including the titles like &#34;Whatever&#34; and &#34;Don't look back in anger&#34;. You'll be so happy with it. Really good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game<br />It is a great game to play<br /><br /> You have to really think on this game...................awesome,awesomeness,awesome,awesome.  Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahat Hashanah  hahaha haha haha
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Great Movie to bad the Amazon Prime system kept booting us off ... we had to restart it a few times. Other than that ... good flick!
B00821OX98|5.0|But the movie is deeply  meaningful<br />There is enough action and suspense to keep you interested<br />Great Love story . I think even men will appreciate it .<br />Really no one should miss this movie.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Loved this book,  This author has quite the imagination!  I liked that he used all the photos to tell the story. This is proabaly one of the fastest books I've read simply because I did not want to put it down till I knew the out come.  Very well written, very desciptive.  I cannot wait till the next one comes out. I have already shared this book with friends who are thoroughly enjoying it also. Will keep recommending it to others as well.
1451695195|5.0|Book was a stunning read and very enlightening, especially  for anyone who has questioned the actual proof of an afterlife.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|It is an amazing book. It spoke to my heart. It has useful tips on how to stand up for ourselves as women in the work place by sitting at the table and not downplay our role. I would encourage those with daughters to let their daughters read it too.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|Here, you get a bit of an auto-biography by King, and you get his suggestions on the craft of writing.  I got it for his ideas on writing. But I found the bio the most interesting part. So, I was a little disappointed, expecting more on the writing craft.  But then, I did enjoy the biography.  So, I'm only giving it 4 stars.  But that means I still recommend it.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This collection is the best of the original Star Trek Adventure.  The fact that you are already familiar with all the characters and their role to the team, these full length adventures are very exciting.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|It's okay but you lose interest, maybe I wasn't ready for it but I think it's a little too pat.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Received them very quickly.  The sound is fantastic from them.  They stay in my ears very well.  I use them every day when I take my daily walk every morning listening to  my walkman radio.  I recommend them highly, as they have a great fit, are very light, stay nicely in my ears and emit the nicest strong stereo sound ever.  Go for it.
B00E1LAS42|2.0|Didn't hold my interest, music should emote a feeling, the music in this film did not, I give it 2 stars for puttin Leo in a one piece
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love all the 3 novels. This last part is not my favourite part, but i must say that i am in love that finally the 2 characters can have a quiet life and start planning something together!
B00D3XAA4M|1.0|When something is free, I still expect it to be interesting.  As a seasoned European traveler, these experiences were not amazing.
B005544V6A|5.0|One of the best lawyer shows I have seen.  Who wouldn't want to be Harvey but in reality are really Mikes???
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|This is an addictive and fun game if you're into the Cthulhu mythos. I found it much easier to understand and play than the board game version. The tutorial is excellent, and the payoff is huge once you've played it a few times. All Fantasy Flight Games are well done in terms of rules, graphics, and overall design, and this game is no exception. The base game is great, and each of the three expansions are more and more fun, adding additional Great Ones, investigators, and game stages. They are progressively more difficult, or were for me, and have made for many hours of fun play. I highly recommend this game!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Just when you don't think you could shock you any more - they do!  It's a great show even if you don't like lawyers.
B0000042MY|5.0|Since two separate composers worked on this soundtrack, the producers of this album chose to group the songs on the disc by composer instead of in the sequence in which they appear in the film.  In my opinion, this greatly detracts from the enjoyment of the soundtrack.  If you wish to reorder the songs on your computer, I believe this is the correct sequence:<br /><br />Main Title<br />Elk Hunt<br />River Walk and Discovery (Yes, River, not Rival.  At least that is what is printed on my CD.)<br />Pieces of a Story<br />The British Arrival<br />Cora<br />The Glade Part II<br />Fort Battle<br />The Courier<br />The Kiss<br />Munro's Office/Stockade<br />Parlay<br />Massacre/Canoes<br />I Will Find You<br />Promontory<br />Top Of The World
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|When you are thinking of purchasing this...think of what it is meant to do.  This is just supposed to be a simple streaming device, and it does this masterfully.  It is NOT going to be like your Apple TV/Roku/Xbox 360 in terms of having apps and other things to keep you entertained.  The CC pairs with your device through your WiFi network (takes like 1 minute to set everything up once you plug it into your TV) and basically takes directions from whatever device you want to use.  Tell your Chromecast to stream Netflix from your phone, then pick up your tablet in the next room and pause the streaming.<br /><br />I bought this because it is $35 and I got 3 months of Netflix, so I thought \\"what the heck\\".  I don't necessarily need it because I have other streaming devices and only one HDTV (student).  So if you have an Apple TV/Roku/Xbox 360 and you are going to use the CC on the same TV, don't except to have any additional functionality besides \\"casting\\" things up onto your TV.  Your other streaming devices have more supported apps right now (I'm sure CC will be supported by almost every major streaming app in the near future).  Don't expect something out of the device that it is not.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I really enjoy this remake. In fact the only two horror remakes of classic genre bending films are this one and the 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead. Both films update the story line, do away with the campiness and bring on full on horror. Not that Evil Dead does not have its flaws but over all a well made movie that is sure to creep you out.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|and it shows. Scrolling, pictures, options, chats, all the features of the interface are easy to access. I would like the &#34;like&#34; button to indicate with some change other than just the green highlight, though. Unfortunately the Kindle Fire will not install the latest version of the Facebook app.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I really enjoy the quick pace and totems in this match three. Sometimes I just want a game that doesn't. Make me think about the<br />puzzle to hard and this game does that for me. Thanks
B00BIPMGD0|5.0|I didn't really think much of this because there isn't much buzz. But its actually really good. I great show to get into.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Love love love it!!!  The product is great it works perfectly. It doesn't distort the sound quality at all like alot of the products out there.  Great price and it saved me Alot of money not having to buy a new system.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its so fun I lov it and its accented isthmut and.liv the game I.lov the challenges and stuff and.hoverboards and me and my frends play this game all.the time!
B005LAII4E|1.0|****SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />I was a fan of the original movie, even though many who claimed they hated it, actually enjoyed it alot more than they let on (the box-office returns don't lie!)<br /><br />The first movie was a not-too serious fantasy actioner with the occasional cheesy nod & wink to both the cartoon and toy line from the `80s. Even when our heroes or world civilians were in peril, there was a light-hearted, fun tone that flowed throughout the movie. Unfortunately, that tone is now completely gone from this movie.<br /><br />Apparently the studios listened to the critics a little too much this time around, since they gutted what was a potentially fun action-fantasy franchise and made this film into nothing more than a generic Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson/Bruce Willis action movie.<br /><br />Gone are pretty much all the characters from the first movie, except for the two main villans, played by different actors this time around, which didn't really matter since their screen time is limited to about five minutes in the entire movie. Even perennial under-actor Channing Tatum (the man cannot emote!), playing the \\"main\\" G.I. Joe character Duke, is killed off on-screen front and center within the first 20 minutes of the film. After that, the downward spiral continues. There are no more grand G.I. Joe or Cobra base sets or cool nano-mite or pulse-shock weaponry that we saw in the first film.<br /><br />The characters are now very generic and boring, and just there to connect each cut/paste quick edit action sequence to the next. Since you don't care about anyone in the movie, it just goes on and on and on. After the first 30 minutes, my movie companion and I both found ourselves watching the clock to see when it would end. We were tempted several times to shut it off, but decided to endure the rest of it just because we knew neither one of us would ever watch it again.<br /><br />This was a blind-buy on Amazon and I really regret purchasing it before seeingthe movie first.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I HAVE HAD THE INTENTIONS OF UPDATING MY IPOD WITH THIS CD FOR AWHILE.  I AM GLAD I FINALLY DID.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|This is somewhere between first and second place in my favorite albums by Queens of the Stone Age.  It's got that comprehensive feel that Songs for the Deaf had while also keeping that newer darker and odder sound from Ulma Vulgaris.
B00004SZWB|5.0|TO THE YEAR OF MY COLLEGE GRADUATION.  ISN'T IT FUNNY HOW ALL THE WORDS CAME BACK TO ME LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|So much fun! Can't wait for more! The puzzles are challenging buy very addictive. I've been looking for a long time for a game like this. Highly recommended.
0142412147|5.0|I love John Green books, so when I saw this book I went ahead and bought it. At first I only read the John Green part, but after lending the book to my friend I finally read the book from front to back. This is now my new holiday tradition, and has been for the past two years. This book gets me in the mood for SNOW! All the stories are pretty great, can't wait for November so I can start reading it again. If you are looking for a book to cuddle up with when the weather gets frosty, give this one a try.
B008JFUN6E|4.0|I went and saw this movie on Friday and it was actually a very good movie not great but not bad either. The movie is a little slow at times it seemed like it was missing something unlike District 9 which was a great movie. The scary thing about Elysium is I see Los Angeles slowly turning out this way where most of the population is Mexican and the city is in ruins possibly from a major earthquake. The movie was very intense at times I was hoping it wasn't going to be too over the top violent but it wasn't too bad.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series is addicting.  Its one of those series that makes you feel good when you watch it.  I will be sad when its over.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Love it . Thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie. Obsession is a young man's game :)  though there may be exceptions.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I love this movie.  The story is good and the action is great.  The director did a great job with the filiming.  It holds you in your chair from start to finish.
0061537969|5.0|I love cars, I love dogs even more. Throw in a great drama, and you've got me!<br />Funny and thoughtful story I'd highly recommend!
B00E72OKAS|3.0|This game is just AWESOME.. but the game available on Amazon is NOT COMPATIBLE with any Android device.. I have an Hp Slate 7\\" running Android OS 4.1 Jelly Bean and the game purchase on Amazon is not compatible with my device.<br /><br />It's not much, but the $1.17 I spent on this App is worthless.... Just need to be more cautious...
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|love it lots.... it is fun it is like typing a lot. you hit keys a lot. but I don't understand do you only get to go 50 rounds...?  ummmmm I wonder. well this is a great app and since it is free now even better.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Wow! The olden ones? Tell me the true true?<br /><br />The true true is that this movie was Terrible. Just terrible!
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|My wife and I decided to select this move for movie night. In spite of the title \\"Mud\\" catchy and interesting. Completely Good, is our new title for this movie. I strongly recommend this movie to those share our interest.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|History needs to be more of what hollywood focuses on. Not just the same old leftist dribble that is being s*** out nowadays!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Cute game, but a little difficult to get past one point. It starts from the beginning each time, so you may eventually get bored seeing the same thing over and over. It takes a while to load back up each time you die too. Cute with good graphics, but it has room for improvement.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Really fun and educational for children and adults alike. Teaches about fish, different forms of sea life, and management. Awesome game.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|my boys have never seen this before and I knew they would love it and thy did!! LOVE IT!! & it was a good price ~cheaper than any where Ive looked

B003L77GGK|5.0|Supernatural is for sure one of the best TV shows I have ever seen! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|purchased this for my husband... was little expensive with shipping but husband is happy so it was worth it lol
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Enjoyed the movie but the streaming quality was somewhat low with pixelation.  Probably just as good as the first two.
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|Thought it was great though I think it missed more interaction between the main character n Melanie and her loved one!
B00821OX98|4.0|I like the acting and story barring just a few stupid mistakes in a couple of episodes that i came across like why would you keep the alien in the same room as that young boy who got manipulated into putting that crawly thing on his back and why would you open that window completely and touch that alien....only to get a dry death.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is so much fun, I recommend this game.My favorite part is breeding dragons and seeing what it is.The only thing I don't like is the gold because almost all of the dragons cost gold and to get gold you have to buy it with real money.But other than that it is a fun game.:-)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed and I I cried and didn't want to put the book down.  Thank you, Mr. Green.  Loved it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't believe how much you will love this game it's fun it's fast l hope you love it enjoy
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Really funny with good stars. There just was not enough time to delve into the plots as much as I would like.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Many\\"productivity\\" books address the need to focus, but Keller does a great job in defining exactly what that focus needs to narrow down to, yet at the same time, encompasses the big picture. Worth reading 2-3 times!
B0042RUMH8|5.0|I love this album. I think this is her best work so far.  Love the songs, the energy and the musicality.  You go girl!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have enjoyed this game. I have other games on the kindle but this is the one that brings me back again and again.
1400031001|4.0|First the good.  I found Any Human Heart to be a very well written, engaging book.  The format of telling the story through journals is effective and entrancing.  I felt like I was pulled deeply into Logan Mountstuart's life in a deep and unique way.  Although it felt a bit Forest Gump-ish, it was a good way of pulling the reader into an understanding of a life that was touched by many pivotal events in the 20th century.<br /><br />The bad.  I really found myself disliking Logan Mountstuart. He was self-centered to an extreme, emotionally distant, and all around somebody I just would not really want to know.  He did some great, admirable things in his life and at least seemed to gain wisdom as he aged, but he was never somebody that I felt I would like to meet.  Although this seemed to be Boyd's desire, it did leave me frustrated sometimes while I was reading the book. But the great writing kept me moving and made Any Human Heart well worth reading.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The series is great; Diana Gabaldon draws the reader in by the suspense and action.  I also shared this book with my mother, who in turn shared it with her friends....

B005FITIGO|1.0|I love Kevin Spacey and the movie theme appealed to me. However I was desperately disappointed. The sets, the script, the direction (especially weak) even the acting I thought was poor and I eventually I lost interest. There was something missing in this film and it should have been better. If you want to see this film, I strongly recommend that you rent it.
B001QJUX24|3.0|This is supposed to be a classic.  Perhaps it is;  but only by providing a caravan of stereotypes about settler-Indian relations.
B0036G1T78|3.0|It left me wondering again about the CIA and our government...Maybe an early Jason Bourne.  How Bad is the CIA anyway?
1601251505|5.0|The book was delivered on time, and in pristine condition. I have a school club that I'm trying to run a game for, so this was an essential book that I needed!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing. August 's problem fit perfectly with the book and the author just put it together. This was a phenomenal book.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|The songs are good and the selection varies with up to ballads. The sound is familiar like a bunch of other stuff on the radio, got it on sale and was pleasantly pleased
B0054SMID0|5.0|My favorite was the disco 70's music when they are driving around! Good Acting and love the plot! lot's of eye candy too!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I was seven and first to watch this series because it takes place in high school. But the situations and acting soon changed my mind. It's hilarious and if you like that type of thing this is definitely a show worth looking at.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Great job of acting by Affleck.  You forgot it was him at times.  He wasn't playing his usual character.  The most amazing thing was that this was a true story.  It was crazy at the end when they showed pictures from the actual events alongside the pictures from scenes of the movie.  There were scenes I was sure were embellished or made up in the movie that actually happened.<br /><br />Nothing ground-breaking here, and definitely sensationalized by Hollywood a bit.  But still an entertaining movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First off, heads up.  For some reason, reviews from other products are being aggregated here.  That's why you see so many low ratings.<br /><br />I'm giving it a 5/5.  The thing cost me 35 dollars, and came with 3 months of Netflix.  It took a month to ship, but it was well worth the wait.<br /><br />Set-up:<br />1.  Very easy, plug it in, and make sure to plug the micro USB jack to a power source (power outlet, or TV's powered USB port).  The adapters/cables are included (HDMI extender, micro USB cable, and power adapter).<br />2.  You then visit the Chromecast setup website using a wireless device (laptop or smartphone).  It will detect the Chromecast, and allow you to link it to your wireless network.<br />3.  Install the Chromecast extension (laptop), or the Chromecast app (phone), and you're good to go.  An icon pops up that lets you \\"cast\\" or \\"beam\\" whatever is in your immediate browser tab (Chrome) or app (phone) to the Chromecast-TV.<br /><br />Additional info:<br />You can change additional settings by using the Chromecast extension, it will ask you if you want to stream via 720p or 720p+, as well as various wide-screen adjustments.<br /><br />Examples of websites I was able to stream: Netflix, Youtube, Twitch, Google.com, and Wimp.com (basically anything openable in a Chrome tab).<br />Example of an app I streamed from the phone: Youtube.<br /><br />I currently have a Roku ($40), which is primarily used for Netflix, Twitch, and local media.  Streaming is dependent on the channel already existing in the Roku library.<br /><br />On the Chromecast, you can also play local video/music files by opening them with Chrome.  There is also a third party app being developed that lets you do this with a phone app.  So the functionality replicates the Roku, however the Chromecast has the advantage of streaming any content that can be full-screened within Chrome.<br /><br />For my uses, it doesn't get any better than this.  5/5 stars, well done GOOG.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Avoided this show for a while as I didn't like &#34;gore.&#34; Finally watched just ONE episode with a co-worker after hearing him go on about it, and was HOOKED! The story lines and characters are what makes this show incredible. CAN'T WAIT.
0307887960|4.0|Easy to read and understand, however, I confess I haven't read it all. Good book so far, and will continue to refer to it.
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|The talented husband and wife duo with their band Tedeschi Trucks Band (TTB) is back with their third album titled 'Made Up Mind' (11 tracks). It's a great follow-up to their 2011 critically acclaimed debut CD 'Revelator' and the well received 2012 live recording collection CD 'Everybody's Talkin''. The CD has a great rich sound (horns/piano/guitar combination as in the title track \\"Made Up Mind\\") or violin/orchestral sound as in the tracks \\"Do I Look Worried\\", \\"Idle Wind\\" and \\"All That I Need\\". Together with the great guitar works by guitarist Derek Trucks and wonderful vocals by Susan Tedeschi  make the album feel well rounded or whole. The southern soul influence is evident in the tracks \\"Part Of Me\\" (quite similar to songs that made Aretha Franklin famous), \\"It's So Heavy\\" (incredible tender ballad, beautiful melody that lingers in my head for long along with great guitar and vocals) & \\"All That I Need\\".<br /><br />On overall, the band Tedeschi Trucks Band has a great album in 'Made Up Mind': great sound and production. I'm sure the fans will have a ball of time when the band hits the road and dish out these tracks live. A recommended CD listening.<br /><br />Suggested download is the track \\"It's So Heavy\\".
B002P5XXR0|5.0|I Loved the movie, loved the music in the movie.  I like the imagery that playing the music gives me.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It's an OK read at best. I ended up skipping entire chapters or entire sections within the chapters. The story isn't half bad, the issue is that Hosseini tends to go off on tangents making it difficult to keep up with the character story changes in each chapter. You don't find out who the story is about in a given chapter until about half way thru. The beginning and middle portion was far better story telling than the ending. I was a bit disappointed in the way he wrote the ending.<br /><br />Overall, it's an OK book. I chose it because I really enjoyed his previous books and it was a part of our book club reading.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I find her ability to play the violin, superhuman.  She can make a violin make some really amazing sounds.  A must listen to, over and over.
B00CXVX1OQ|2.0|IMPORTANT NOTE: It appears there are 2 pages for Monkey Boxing since one shows around 30 reviews and another shows like over a thousand reviews on it.  I posted this review twice but deleted the second post after the first one started showing up.  So there should only be one review for this game from me now posted on Amazon.<br /><br />The free paid app of the day in the Amazon Appstore for August 20, 2013 is Monkey Boxing by Crescent Moon Games.<br /><br />I saw the title and icon for this game Monkey Boxing and I thought this was going to be one of those rather silly games.  Then I saw the huge number of 5 star ratings this thing was getting.  So I thought this might actually be good.  Then I happened to notice that this game is from the same app maker as Paper Monsters which I haven't reviewed yet, but it was a fairly good game.  So at this point I am thinking that maybe this will be a 5 star game like mostly everyone else is giving this.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me this is not a 5 star game.  Not even close.<br /><br />While many others may like this game, I didn't care for it hardly at all.  The app maker in this case decided to go with a cosmetic approach rather than a game play approach.<br /><br />You can dress your monkey in different color outfits and add different items for the monkey to wear, but it doesn't affect the game play at all.<br /><br />When it comes to the actual matches, the game play is rather repetitive and totally unrealistic.  You are basically either throwing punches (that always seem to conveniently land in your opponent's body) or blocking punches by putting your fists up to block the incoming punches of your opponent.  You and your monkey opponent never seem to really move around in this 3D ring except left and right along a two dimensional path in the ring.<br /><br />I also miss the trash talking interviews that you see before the actual fights in real boxing which is a huge element to the sport.  And boxing doesn't feel like boxing without a Michael Buffer type announcer announcing the introductions.<br /><br />If you really want a simple repetitive boxing game with the ability to dress up a monkey in different outfits, this might be the game for you.  I just don't care for this type of game much and apparently I am in the minority here based on the number of 5 star reviews.  I am just trying to give my honest opinion of this game which is going to vary from person to person.<br /><br />Had the app maker put as much detail into other aspects of the sport like they did for the monkey's appearance, this might have been a 5 star game by my standards, but since this is just a repetitive punch throwing game, I have to give this only 2 stars out of a possible 5 stars.<br /><br />At $2.99 this is overpriced and I would recommend Paper Monsters from the same app maker for only $0.99 instead.

B00CU8OVIM|3.0|This was my first and I found several tracks to be quite good while others seemed like space fillers.  I will continue to play it in hopes that my opinion is changed. The songs I do like are quite good and I would recommend the CD.

I know her record label has put out a few weird CD's these past years but this is the best!

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I'm glad I read this book after seeing the Netfilx series. It gave a more accurate reflection of her experience yet shows the series delivers a true representation of life in prison with maybe a little less graphic sex and drugs. But then again she said she did not focus on that stuff in her book. I highly recommend this book. I does show we clearly need a major discussion about the reform of our legal system for non-violent offenders.

0061726834|4.0|I picked up Delirium for my reading challenge this week. Lena lives in a world that fears love, where on their 18th birthday they get cured. Lena has just started her evaluation which isn't going very well when it's interrupted by a herd of cattle. The evaluation is important it will pair Lena with her future husband and set the path for the rest of her life. The higher the score the better the life; however it's a life without emotions after she's cured.<br /><br />It's while running with her best friend Hana does she meet the boy who was looking down on her when the cattle entered her evaluation room. He invites Lena to meet with him later before curfew, which is conflicting because boys and girls don't interact until they are paired. While Lena is worried about breaking the rules her best friend Hana is all about doing what she wants. When Lena tags along with Hana to an illegal party she sees the boy from the lab Alex. Lena learns that Alex has been admiring her from afar; the two embark on a forbidden romance that will challenge everything Lena has known. Will Lena get the cure or will she risk it all for love?<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure about Lena she's a good girl who follows the rules while her best friend is all about living and being herself. I found Hana interesting, but the more the book progressed I started to like Lena. I was sold on Lena when she started sneaking away to spend time with Alex it's a unique twist on the Romeo and Juliet concept if you think about it. Forbidden love in a world where love is forbidden. As the book progresses Lena breaks out of her shell into an interesting character plus she has Alex you can't help liking right from the start.<br /><br />I admit the concept sounds interesting, a world without love that's a first for me. A unique modern twist of Romeo & Juliet meets dystopian society. I love the story takes place in Portland because I've been there so I can really imagine what Lena's world looks likes. The characters are interesting easy to connect with, but Lena is a little slow getting started, because I liked her more after she started meeting Alex. I love how sweet the romance is between Lena and Alex their story is beautifully done. Delirium is a captivating story it instantly sucked me right in I had to know what was going to happen next and what Lena would do when it came time to be cured. The book is well written it flows along smoothly, with interesting detailed facts that the author has researched and added to the book. I enjoyed the book, found the characters intriguing and I'm looking forward to the next one. This is my first book my Lauren Oliver but I found her writing style one that teens as well as adults will enjoy.s are interesting easy to connect with, but Lena is a little slow getting started, because I liked her more after she started meeting Alex.

0062059963|1.0|Okay, I read the Selection about a year ago and I was totally hooked (keep in mind, I'm 13) I loved the idea and I was okay with the less than stellar writing. I read that about 8 times, so I was totally excited to read the next one when it arrived at my library. Now that I've read it, I can honestly say, it was not worth my hype. America, the female protagonist, is possibly the most bipolar person ever to exist in a book. She goes from being defiant and standing up for what she believes in, to apologizing profusely and whining. She practically changed love interests every two pages. I honestly feel sorry for Aspen; he's risking his job (and to a certain extent, life and dignity) so he can make America happy, while she constantly goes crawling back to another guy about, once again, every two pages, I honestly expected America to catch him kissing one of her maids halfway through. Here is Aspens job summed up in two sentences: 1) Work away from home to provide for his family. 2) Try to win back the heart of his girlfriend while she's constantly whining about another guy that she's into! Speaking of wich, I liked Maxon a whole lot less in this book. He's a conceited nice guy, does that even make sense?!?! I used to be team Maxon, but any chance of me continuing that streak has been reduced to zero. I'm not team Aspen either, he was a jerk in the first book and I'm still not over that. I'm on team rebel. What they really need to do is break into the palace and kill one of the Elite. Fine, it doesn't have to be kill, just shot. We need some drama up in here! So, a final summary of the characters:<br /><br />America: whiney, bipolar, and jealous<br />Aspen : nice, determined, idiot ('why do you think they're stealing the books? I don't know, maybe for kindling?' Come on!)<br />Maxon: conceited, rich, nice guy<br />The king: psychotic<br />Queen Kimberly: pretty nice<br />America's dad: awesome, now my favorite character<br />Kriss: mean, obnoxious, jealous<br />Rebels: To dang weak! If you're starting rebellion, act like it!<br />Marlee: Why? Why did you have to date that guard? You're my second favorite character!o dang weak! If you're starting rebellion, act like it!<br />Marlee: Why? Why did you have to date that guard? You're my second favorite character!
140006922X|5.0|Reza Asland portrays life as it was historically, not as it has been glorified or &#34;cleaned up&#34;  in the Bible and so many other publications.  His insight into the political lives of those in that period is stellar.  A great read and very informative!

This Music has done wonders as you would listen and be taken back by the close harmonics of these women's voices.  I would recomend this album to all those who would need a deep relaxed atmosphere from a very hectic day.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A story of a girl in Nazi Germany told from the perspective of a death angel. Many touching moments, but also unexpected humor. The author is a genius at character development. The characters are rich and appear authentic.  This novel is not like a lot of Nazi era stories as it is well balanced between sadness, love and hopefulness.

As such, I will not be buying any more movies from them. When you buy the movie, you don't really buy it you license it.<br />Too Bad.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book!  Very thought provoking and OH so...true!  Couldn't put it down. This has got to continue moving up in the NYT Bestseller list.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great story.  I have to agree with some of the other reviews that at times the level of writing can be juvenile.  Personally, what bothered me more is some of the dialogue was un-Americanized.  The book is set in Seattle, WA and the characters are American.  But when I read this, in my mind Christian had an English accent.  In America, we do not &#34;fetch&#34; things.  We get things or grab things.  Americans do not &#34;fancy a game&#34; of pool, we play a game.  But these were small annoyances, I loved both the main characters.  I've read the series three times and I am currently suffering from post-book depression...sad that I can never read it for the first time ever again.
B00DQBWLSO|2.0|I feel like John Mayer has changed his style drastically. He has a good sense in music but I really miss the old John Mayer and his old style of music. He has changed. I loved room for squares why cant their be another album like that. But in this album their is really no electric guitar and no good licks I love it when he does that. I just didn't like the album that much.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|My wife and I love good adventure and action movies, but the language and the computergraphics destroy most of the modern ones.  This one may use some trick photography, but for the most part it was just a nail biter, from start to finish -- and the good guy wins.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is a wonderful book that guides us to slow down a bit. Stop and realize the true essence and nature of things. Contemplate on the mortality of how we identify ourselves and how we identify with ourselves, and on the true immortality of who we really are, and our oneness with Being.<br />Being somewhat very lightly familiar with mystical sufi islam, i found though that the way in which Tolle describes his matters are mostly over complicated. The ideas and principles in the book are somehow embedded in Us by nature, and thus should not require this sophistication or complexity. Nevertheless, the book serves as an amazing way to awakening. Bringing us back to what really matters, and even describing it from angles we never thought of before.<br />Overall, the book has had an immense effect on me. I remember someday in the distant past to be somewhat primitively aware of what Tolle is talking about, but to have sadly lost it along the way, and i believe that &#34;now&#34; is the perfect moment to get back on track.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Made in 1984, I can't ever remember a time that Gremlins wasn't part of my December.  Steven Spielberg gives us this borderline terrifying movie coupled with hilarity, jokes, and slapstick to get us through what could have been a potential horror flick.  A father buys his son a gift in the form of a Mogwai, a cute little ball of fur with big bat ears, for Christmas.  This cute, adorable, little pet has only three rules.  1) They hate bright lights and sunlight can kill them, 2) They should never be gotten wet, and 3) They should never be fed after midnight.  Gizmo, the name of the Mogwai, becomes fast friends with Billy, the son, but when an accident happens getting Gizmo wet, a whole world of trouble is brought to their sleepy, snow-ridden town during that particular Christmas.<br /><br />Gremlins is a fun, fast movie, for people of all ages, and has been a name stay during the holidays since it came out nearly three decades ago.  This particular DVD has a few special features, like 10 minutes of extra footage, commentaries, behind-the-scenes documentaries, and the trailer.  It's definitely worth the few bucks you would spend on it and is sure to provide your family and yourself with much entertainment over the years.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Hate to cheerlead but I believe this production's high reputation is not only deserved but sure to hold up no matter how many \\"groundbreaking\\" hourly dramas the cable channels produce by the ton. FWIW I'd seen the remake before yet couldn't help myself to an intermission/sleep break till starting up the 4th episode, in the wee hours like a fiend. It's what \\"The Wire\\" might be if they resisted sociology lecturing or dwelling on bureaucratic idiocy. Considering the high-quality cast from the remake I was surprised to enjoy this group even more. Rather than drive the story by piling on plot minutia and sleuthing gimmicks--plenty of those, fear not--there's a heavy emotional undercurrent, pitting the outstanding Polly Walker as a steely counterpoint to the churning, sort of scary David Morrissey. And to repeat what everybody said, Bill Nighy is amusing as hell; actually I can't think of a role that isn't played superbly, from the wiry, scruffy, loyalty-juggling \\"team leader\\" who is just enough of a jerk to fasten your attention, all the way to supporting figures like the slain teenager's family, the newspaper's smooth lawyer, or a cameo by Susie Porter as a brassy (read: American) PR directress.<br /><br />Small caveat--The adultery theme/sub-plot is unflinching here, especially the effect on young children, much in contrast to the anodyne Russell Crowe version (which remains violent/monstrous in other aspects). I'd agree however that it pays off in dramatic force for certain events beginning the final episode.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I will admit that there isn't anything mind-blowing or 100% original scare wise but it definitely has it's fair share of uber creepy moments. I completely agree with other reviewers that complimented the real effects and smart use of CGI. Overall the story is wonderful and concise and absolutely deserving of at least a sequel. Bravo B.C. and crew.
1844137872|4.0|This is more of a picture book, the written content is minimal, but still a worthwhile purchase and thought provoking.  I keep coming back to it again and again.  It raises so many questions.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really enjoy this game but wish the energy would last longer<br />.  It is fun to play and some of the puzzles become more challenging as you go along.  I do not buy the crystals to continue to play but it is an option.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|I just had started watching Firefly in Hulu and became addicted to it. Great show - Joss Whedon it's such a visionary. I was frustrated when I learned the show had been cancelled after only 1 season. But found solace and consolation in the Serenity Movie. If you are a fan of the series, you MUST watch the movie to tie the knots and allow yourself to find closure. If you have never seen the show, you still will be able to understand the movie (even if you are not a die hard fan of Sci-Fi). The plot does hold better if you are familiar and understand the background of the characters, but it can stand on its own as a fast pace action/adventure story.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Super item, compact, convenient, very easy to use. I would recommend this item to friends and family. This item has saved me on several occasions.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|A well written, captivating story.  The character development is good, and the story held my attention.  I generally don't like post apocalyptic stories, but this one held my attention and I plan to get the Shift Omnibus Edition and read it.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|I generally dislike going to the movie theaters to watch any movie; the parking, the high ticket prices, the expensive snacks, the noisy/inconsiderate audience, etc.  Buying this Blu-ray saved me the trouble and that's a plus in it's favor.  The special effects were good, the story line a bit thin, the script was awful, and the character development more suited to a weekly TV series which is what I thought when I saw the ending.  No spoiler alert here.  None needed as the ending was so predictable.  I was waiting for the &#34;...to be continued&#34; on the closing shot.  If this were a classic James Bond film, I would expect something like &#34;H&G will return in...&#34;  Suffice to say, the film was okay (not even close to the Brothers Grimm movie from a handful of years ago) and worth buying at less than retail price.  I'll keep this Blu-ray and loan it out to my friends.  If you're a Jeremy Renner fan, buy it.
0060005696|5.0|Excellent.. It's amazing how having too many choices can drive anyone crazy. The author  that an excellent job pointing out the problems that's society faced when there are too many choices...
B00DW5IKJI|5.0|Definitely  the most complete compilation of Britney Spears hits to date. We can find almost all her hit singles. If you are a fan you will love it, if you are not and you want to know her music this is an excellent option.<br /><br />The best of the best!!!
B002BWP49M|5.0|I liked this series. It was an easy watch and a great movie. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a good drama!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is very fun and challenging. I love playing it! It is one of my favorite apps on my kindle fire HD! LOVE IT!!!!!!!
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|I liked this series. It was an easy watch and a great movie. I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a good drama!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This app took up all of my kindle storage space and I have very few apps absolutely do not download
B002XZOZQA|5.0|Love, Love, Love this! Today, tomorrow, and always! Actually am going to purchase the move as well from Amazon! Just Awesome!
B009NX50DM|4.0|Made in 1969 so it is not as reliant on high tech as the remake. Not as much of an advertisement for the Mini as the remake and does not rely on the family and romantic ties between characters.  Is a little more of a comedy at times and gives viewers a better tour through Tourin.  I really enjoyed this more than the newer version.<br /><br />Semi Spoiler -  the end might be a little bit of a cliff hanger for some viewers so be warned that it may leave you hanging. :-)
B009JBZH54|5.0|No trouble with delivery. Everything came as expected and I love these movies. I was able to get them on sale as the bundle which was awesome.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I love the way he takes the story through all the characters.  I'm really hoping for the next one soon.  It keeps me waiting for what happens to each person.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|a bit easy for me but good for young tweens and teens. only 10 levels available to start and I finished all 10 in an hour. just waiting for more levels to download.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awsome I just wish I can get it on my computer. And I also want to get sonic minecraft BAD!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|It's a heartfelt story but recent scientific research published in the last month or so can strongly defend a neuron storm of activity that results in such brain activity during brain trauma. The author, as a neurosurgeon understandably wrote this more from emotion than science. Further research may simple extinguish any validity for the book other than another near death experience. I was rather hoping he could be more could be more convincing...I would love to have a solid basis to believe in something so serene to after this life.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|This is a classic movie reminiscent of the 70's, or 80's. WOW  I enjoy it every time I see it!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is a great headset. i would buy again if i ever need another.  Try it for yourself and you will see.
B009YQJ322|4.0|Would  have liked to see Carl Urban face somewhere in the movie. He has been the co star in several movies, it was nice to see him his own movie but I would have liked to see his face!
B00AO686MY|5.0|My brother loved this movie especially now that it is in high def. great for the family and a great movie
B001BR5NH6|5.0|This is an older movie, but I enjoy it every time I see it. The first part of the movie is hysterical!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book gives you an eye opening view of what heaven is like. I believe that my family members that have passed on will be waiting for me with open arms. When my mother passed away many years ago, you could feel the calmness that was taking over her body in her last days. Eben Alexander III has given us an insight of what will be our last voyage. There was some technical &#34;doctor talk&#34; that was way over my head but I still read it so that I could say I read the whole book. It was ironic that I had been reading this book last week when Dr. Alexander appeared on the Dr. Oz show. It was nice to see the man who wrote this book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who may have any doubts of heaven.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I really enjoyed watching these movies with my kids.  They aren't so &#34;scary&#34; that the kids couldn't watch them with me.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Purchased just the final episode of last season. Excellent and will watch it again before the new season starts. This is such a funny show!
B0024F08RO|5.0|Outstanding acting, directing and writing. Each episode left us wanting for more. I would recommend this series to anyone. Price was right - free shipping was fantastic!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun!!!!!!!it has good graphics .just wish they gave more keys for us to capture. They would. Be nice..
B00A285OOW|3.0|THIS BOOK WAS NOT NEARLY AS EXCITING AS THE WHITE QUEEN. THE STORY AND PRINCESS/QUEEN ELIZABETH'S CHARACHTER SEEMS UNDERDEVLOPED AND WEAK.
B007REV4T8|2.0|I expected a lot more.  Poor acting, Poor effects.  Weak storyline.  Predictable.  Very disappointed.  Hopefully they will redeem themselves next time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|4 stars, Its full of action and thrill, I don't like all the Gore everything else was just amazing,It was awesome!.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|It was okay and i enjoyed reading it up to the end.  But again, it left me hanging and I was hoping that more questions would be answered.  I guess I have to wait until the next book.  Not happy about it! But I would read this one because of his elegance of prose as compared to Daniel Silva's &#34;The English Girl&#34;.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great story line; good acting; not as bloody as I anticipated. If you like Quentin Tarantino's movies then you are sure to like this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you get all different games that you get to buy with coins you earn from playing games and earning points and coins
B005LAII3A|4.0|I actually think this is slightly better than the original for two reasons.  First, the original was a landmark film for Computer Graphic special effects.  (It may have won the Academy award?)  This version is better because of the update effects throughout.  The first film looks a aged and boxy by comparison (technology).  The second reason I like this film better is Kate Beckinsale. (sic)  If movie villains make a movie then she deserves much of the credit for any success this movie enjoys.  As good as Sharon Stone was in the original, Beckinsale out does her in every category.  Who knew the Predator and the Terminator characters could be re-done, combined in a size 2!!<br />I didn't give it four stars because the lead (Colin Farrell) played the Arnold (Shwartzeneggar) sic. role without ever trying to make anything of it.  I think he was still confused about who he was when the credits were rolling or he was in another reality at &#34;Rekall&#34; any way he was 5 to Beckinsale's 10.  The movie actually was not &#34;Totally&#34; different than the original.  Both butchered the true &#34;reality&#34; of the story by Phillip K. Dick, imho.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game very challenging but fun at the same time and you'll never get bored because this app has 132 different games that can be played. But your points that you earn playing the games and also use to unlock more games run out quickly so use them wisely.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Everytime I try to get past level 9 the game freezes and turns off. I tried to reload the game with the same results.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Have this app on my iPad, Blackberry Z10, and Kindle Fire HD.. installs easy, allows me to work anywhere, works great
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|Action packed, funny lines, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. awesome weapons, action of the hook! WooHoo
B009LRE040|4.0|The image quality isn't outstanding, however it isn't piss poor either. I had to download the Amazon Instant Video app to watch it on my Ipad. I love having access to the movies I buy on Amazon from anywhere though, and the price was outstanding. Thanks Amazon.
B0060D1B2C|5.0|Beautiful, heartfelt movie. Story line are beautifully told and pull you right into the lives of these amazing woman! Love it!
B00AFEQA5K|1.0|Boring and violent.  I had seen the trailer and somehow they had taken every entertaining moment  from the film and put it in the trailer, because there was nothing left.
B007T9UIMA|4.0|My Niece loved this!  She's 16 and a 1D mega fan!  She liked that it was real concert footage and behind the scenes.  I watched it too and it was so much better than some of the other &#34;so called&#34; 1D DVD's out on the market.
B0041D843M|4.0|If you are thinking about becoming a vegan anytime soon, you should read this book. Great scientific support for moving to a plant based diet
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|More than you expect. An absolute must-read! Wether you believe in one or the other religion, the search for the history of Jesus is a fascinating subject, and Aslan points out - but you decide - how this Man / God /Prophet influenced the world we live in
B0009U6XC0|5.0|Brought back many memories of my childhood and the music set the stage completely! Thank you doe offering it free for prime members I plan on getting the soundtrack!
B003G4W49C|4.0|I can't really review since a family member watched it but I usually hear if it was a horrible move.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|Great fun, the characters draw you in and make you want to know what happens to them and find out their stories.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|My son loved this series and keeps bugging us parents to watch it.  Waiting for those cold weather nights to catch up with him.
B008Y6RGFE|5.0|Great movie and I highly recommend it and it was hysterically funny. Will Smith was great in the role and a gray dating storyline.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|My son loved this series and keeps bugging us parents to watch it.  Waiting for those cold weather nights to catch up with him.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great way to pass the time. I love the detail in the game and the minions make me smile the entire time I'm playing.
B0035XVVDY|4.0|One of my children watched this and I heard no complaints.  They are all older so I don't always watch what they watch.
B00271B752|5.0|The movie was great also a classic, Al Pacino is one of my favorites is a great actor Amazon yah did it again thank you
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Maybe at the theater is played better with all the bright colors and maybe went over better with the younger set.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Me and my cousin love it. If you like My Little Pony you will love this!  It is kind of like Cityville my cousin says.
B000XXGMUQ|3.0|i gets tons of compliments and they are comfy but im a 13 in most every sneaker boot i wear and these are too big. i bought them for hiking but the extra toe space made them not practicle so now they are my city boot. make sure to get he right fit.
B00CATSONE|4.0|It's always good to learn new ideas & viewpoints. It's sad to learn people have been taken advantage of.  It was, however, a good read.
0812983459|4.0|A book about hope and finding your way. Everyone can benefit from reading it. A great summer book from young to old.
B008476HBM|5.0|What romantic at heart wouldn't love it.  jane Austen at her very best.  Could read it at least once a year.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|is a very nice movie and a great way to see your 80's action movie stars, and as the 80's a lot of exagerated action heros who can extend the amo on their guns
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Love it----One of the best TV series that has every been made-----Real sense of how life was really like doing that time----The Actors were Great and really should have won awards----
B008DBF5Z8|3.0|The good: The image quality is really good, far better than what I expected at the price. The included software is also very good, it installs easily and is user friendly.<br /><br />The bad: The joints on the stand break very easily. The plastic around the positioning nuts is too thin and cracks. I have 6 of these cameras and this has happened on every single one.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is a terrific camera for occasional use but cannot stand up to daily use in a classroom.
B001KTATIS|4.0|Very Good Movie----Gives you a view into the life of the upper class of the Roman Empire-----Very interesting to say the least----Could see myself living at that time in History----
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it rocks! You can do multiplayer and everything. But you need the same WiFi. It's more fun with multiplayer. There is this thing called realms and it lets ten minecrafters play at once. But you need a moaning account. Buy this app guys.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game had amazing graphics and fluidity for a mobile game. I'd compare it to Black Ops 2. This game has a lot of features for a mobile game and has fairly deep weapon customization.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this - I have over 150 boards and alot of followers.<br />I enjoy seeing other people's boards.  It is interesting to<br />see boards that pertain to things in the past.  Brings back<br />alot of memories and the boards on different foods are<br />really neat - I have tried quite a few of the recipes.  Thank<br />you Amazon for Pinterest.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Recommended by my ex-wife and my son, this is a wonderful novel.  Well-written, with a great story line that includes dogs and car racing… What more could you want!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book--transitioned seemlessly from the first to the third, and was a definite page-turner. Men, I think you would enjoy too, so don't be skeptical!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A beautifully filmed series. Appears to be very authentic in terms of costuming and sets for the era between the two world wars. Compelling story line. Perfect for anglophiles and romantics!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love that the author summed everything up and just didn't leave the reader hanging. It was kind of a let down to have to finish, but I really enjoyed this series!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|This album is so fun to listen to. It really grabs you and before you know it you (and the kids in the backseat!) are singing along.
0792164903|5.0|I am not certain why this is my favorite movie??  Since I am from the Bay Area, it may have something to do with the consistent gloomy weather (lol).  Seriously, I think that I just really enjoy Johnny Depp's marvelous performance!!  Moreover, all of the supporting stars such as Christina Ricci and even Martin Landau (he got his head chopped off in the beginning of the film), their performance, the time period (turn of the Century), the details, it is all consuming!!  Lastly, when I occasionally share my opinion with friends about Depp's entire career (music & acting), I give him a lot of &#34;Kudos&#34; about the challenging and unpopular roles that he selected such as  &#34;Edward Scissor Hands.&#34;  Clearly, I suspect their were also some lean years that he had to endure.  On a final note, I believe Johnny Depp's original trademark is when he yells and faint (smile).  It's hilarious!! And he does it so well in this film and others (i.e. The Ninth Gate, etc.).  All in all, he really works hard @ his craft and it is evident in this movie.  Enjoy, by all means!!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Please make some changes to this application, the video suggestions are so limited and doesn't allow me to waste my time browsing through suggested videos.  There's no conmment section. I like reading the comments of ignorant people, it makes me smile.
B007WPM7SO|5.0|I started this at 10 pm and didn't finish until the wee hours of the morning. I wish there were more, but I think the season wrapped up with 2 episodes. A mini-series of passion, angst, love, and war.
B00946WM6Q|5.0|The first Daniel Craig Bond movie I've seen - quite a departure from the previous Bonds.  Less &#34;fantastical&#34; - not a lot of gadgets but a lot of action and brute strength.  Has much higher human quality to it than previous Bonds.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really liked this book.  It was just awesome.  I can't wait for the upcoming movie.  Ender is just an awesome character and this book is great.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This is a quality DVD and sure beats a few bootlegs I could barely watch. If you are into the Stones doing Blues with some of Chicago's best, then this is a must for your Stones DVD collection.
B008Y7DDBE|3.0|Take shelter! There's a really boring movie brewing.<br />This movie is visually striking and Michael Shannon plays his character well.<br />That said, I kept waiting for it to get interesting.<br />It doesn't.<br />Then it ends.
B00362DRNG|5.0|This album was amazing and I really enjoyed the different versions of the songs as well as the videos, especially Night Boat, which I hadn't seen for years.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A great read!  I couldn't put the book down.  The story kept you guessing until the very end when everything came together.  I can't wait to read the next book in this series.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I downloaded this at the suggestion of fellow Kindle owners as a way to download (and thus update) the latest version of Acrobat. Unfortunately, I can't pull it from the cloud to use it, and for some reason Amazon won't let me download it directly to my Kindle. As a product, I can't say whether it works or not or how well it performs; however, the whole botched download/cloud process has really turned me off to Amazon apps. Hopefully, you will have better luck...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game.  Great puzzles.<br />Played it all of the time and now waiting for more levels. Can't wait when are you updating this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The greatest minion adventure ever. It truly allows you to be as despicably clever in collecting points in the form of your beloved bananas.
1616550414|5.0|This book contains everything you need to know about Zelda. If you love Zelda then<br />you will love this book!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Really strong album, a great listen.  A bit more experimental, I guess, than the previous two albums, but nothing too crazy.  Have purchased it for friends and family as well.
B00DC8O6T8|5.0|Absolutely love this CD. My new guilty pleasure. It's under the Alternative genre, but it has a total 80's pop/disco sound. Definite influences from the Bee Gee's and Michael Jackson. Easy to listen to from start to finish.
B008K9SG9K|3.0|Decent tracks, but not really worth the purchase of the entire album.  Pretty much the same pop/dance/etc. that everybody seems to be doing these days.  I'd recommend a listen on internet radio, then just buy the singles you can't live without.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Easy to read especially on Kindle.  Never saw the play but book is very interesting. Worth the read. 1st book I'm reading on Kindle.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I love Ken Follett's stories and this one did not disappoint. It is long but worth every minute. It is constantly changing and introducing new twists in the plot. One caution, don't be tempted to rent the film version. The story is distorted and not what you will read in the book. It truly is hard to put it down and I was sorry to come to the end.
B007KLKFSO|5.0|A wonderful story! Brought me back to memories of my own relationships in the distant past.  The awkward beginnings and doubts and fears that were all normal but, we did not realise it at the time.  Brilliantly brought together by the author. I enjoyed every bit of it.
B003INBOE2|5.0|This is a absolute awesome and you can't beat the price for a blu-ray movie.  I will definitely keep an eye out for more deals.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book gonna start the next book now  Love that I get them for free .. ..
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I purchased this case specifically for the size and style. I wanted something to protect my Kindle that didn't have straps on all four sides to hold it in, but more importantly, could take the occasional jarring without damaging it. My Kindle snaps securely into the device and the strap does a good job of keeping the screen protected. Worth the money!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|it is a fun game and you can play by yourself.  getting use to it and it is a great pastime between appts.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|If you don't want to sync with the Withings app, then this is a good tracker.  But I prefer to be able to have the tracker sync up to my app and keep a diary for me.  It worked with the app pretty well the first week of use but now nothing, although for some reason my Withings scale is no longer syncing up either so maybe it's just an app problem.  Regardless I bought this to sync up and keep a diary for me.<br />  As for the carrying case it comes with, DON'T TRUST IT!!!!  After two weeks of wearing it in the holster on my belt, which is how Withings says they prefer you to wear it, it fell out.  After sending out a search party and retracing my steps of EVERYWHERE I went that day, one of my employees found it under a desk.  It literally fell out of this so called trusty case just walking around the office.  Just walking.  No running, biking or any other physical activity.  Imagine if I was out cycling and it fell out.  It would be gone for good.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My wife and I love this show. Lot's of great characters that really make the show immersing. I don't usually like law shows but this one is interesting for everyone.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like it, but found it to be an excellent read.  Good story line with historical details.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's good for a free app. I love it, I play it almost every day.  :D<br /><br />Daniel Petero - age 13
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book may get a bad rap because of the sexual content, but this Ida very good book. The author took the storyline into a good direction and that left me wanting more of the characters! Good job
B004Y1USWQ|5.0|i've been into YES since 1971.seen them numerous times,including Aug.of 2013.they are a giant band in prog circles.this album is as good as most anything they've put out(there are a few exeptions).i picked this album up as soon as it came out and wow is all i can say.the title track is worth it alone.Then i found a copy of this album on HMCD.talk about great sound quality.it was pricy but well worth the investment.the highs the lows everything was there and beautiful.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|This group is just awesome. The MP3 has tons of great songs and plays very nicely on my iphone. Can't say enough about it
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Loved this movie. Very cute, quirky, entertaining, and a little bit different than your usual love story. I will be adding this to my DVD collection.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This game is really beautiful!  I found the puzzles to be challenging and fun, if a tee wy bit obscure once or twice.  But the hints kept me from getting stuck.  It ran just fine on my kindle fire--no crashes at all.  Great Job!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a very entertaining book! I never wanted to put it down! I'm really looking forward to the movie!!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Wow.  The science, the action, the speculation all top notch.  I've just read my first two of James Rollins' novels in a row and am starting the third one in the next ten minutes.  This guy writes like I wish I did.  Similar ideas and interests to mine, but terrific research and word craft all through.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Therefore I love glee with all the singing and dancing and humor I am completely happy watching stories I have seen before but still enjoy.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|This mobile app allows you to browse and purchase the current sales with ease.  It also gives you access to the community and chat functions.  Missing are the videos and the ability to utilize the forums.<br /><br />Overall 4/5
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This is an awesome app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Totally worth $1. The one thing I don't like is ads, but besides that I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|this is cool because it shows the percentage, the hours and minutes of life left in the battery on your Kindle. When you touch the &#34;advance&#34; button, you can see the temperature, voltage, health and technology meters. Pretty cool.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I haven't been this invested in a bunch of scumbags since the first season of the Sopranos. It just keeps getting darker and yet more and more engaging.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|The Angry Bird games have become so incredibly popular. They are challenging and funny and you could probably get addicted.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Great game for all ages. It will tire you out like real boxing, so taking a break after 30 minutes is highly recommended!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the final part of this trilogy. I loved seeing Ana give Christian the ultimatum. I loved that he chose to push his problems aside and give Ana himself forever. It was the twists and turns that made me want to read more. I could not put the book down and wait another minute to read any more of this story. E.L. James you did an awesome job. It was hot, sexy, sweet and romantic. I think anyone and everyone should read these books.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Loved the story and the plot twists. I loved I could watch it my way. What more can I say
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the continuation of an awesome and great story. Anastasia left Christian so she could pursue her dream of working in a publishing company. Anastasia's love and thoughts become dominated by Christian. I actually loved this book because E.L. James made me fall in love with these character's. This book was amazing and I loved reading more about their story.
B009MYARIK|5.0|This was a terrific find!  The book came quickly and was a pleasure to read.  I would highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game! Very addicting and it makes you really think. Have a piece of paper handy to write down numbers and combinations!!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I have several top quality survival knives.  This one was met<br />with great satisfaction.  Top Quality.  You won't be disappointed!!!<br />It will be my &#34;go to&#34; knife from now on!!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Was skeptical to watch the show but glad I did. It started out with a good story line and is intriguing to continue watching
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is soooo addictive, but in a good way! It's so freaking fun! Stop reading this review and download this game right now! And get the second as well!:)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It was better than Season 1! And with the ending of the season, I can't wait to watch the next one but waiting patiently for Season 3 to become avaliable on Amazon!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher novels. Glad they made a movie about one. Only problem in the novels Reacher is 6'5 Tom cruise is 5'6
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Great characters and funny storylines make Awkward entertaining for the MTV-type audience.  Sadie's pure evil is so entertaining! I can't wait to watch Seasons 2 and 3!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|This is the book that followed the BBC tv show about the scientific basis for claims that people can live longer by restricting their calorie intake. It became a show about the only diet that actually works (having a scientific basis makes all the difference)! Especially the part written by Michael Mosley is worth reading. The second part makes it complete but has no added value on its own.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|Having never experienced The Phantom of the Opera prior to seeing this version on PBS, my review is biased.  However, this performance is so spectacular, after viewing the DVDs repeatedly, I ordered the CDs from Amazon as well as it is the complete sound version of the DVD.<br /><br />Ramin Karimloo, as the Phantom and Christine, performed by Sierra Boggess, took my breath away.  Christine was my personal favorite as her voice is so pure as she performs her part as the Angel of Music.  The Phantom after hearing Christine sing, sings \\"BRAVO! BRAVO!!\\" to her.  (I say BRAVO! BRAVO!!, Sierra).<br /><br />From what I understand, many performances have a cast of around 45.  Since this is the 25th Anniversary performance, this particular performance has a cast of approximately 145 and Albert Hall is so beautiful that it will be put on my personal bucket list as a place for me to visit someday.<br /><br />Following the performance, the 25th anniversary celebration ensues which is a performance in of itself.  It is complete with the appearance of Andrew Lloyd Webber himself and members of the original cast including Sarah Brightman who played Christine, the first Angel of Music, along with several Phantoms from previous performances.<br /><br />This makes a wonderful gift for anyone who has an appreciation for the arts and theatre.  There will be many more copies I will be purchasing for presents in months to come.<br /><br />Now, that I have relived the excitement of Phantom, I must go watch and listen to it again.<br /><br />Since I have NEVER made the time and effort to EVER review anything, you will understand how much I love this performance.<br /><br />Margaret; \\"The Phantom of Reviews\\" (my new self appointed title)
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Very addictive game lots of fun. My family argues about who's turn it is. I recommend this to the entire family.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I liked the graphics and the concept of the game. It went too fast for my old brain and fingers to keep up so I deleted it. I think the kids will love this game as the characters are fun and trying to catch the bananas is a challenge. just on for this 60+ grandma!
B008N9AAQ4|2.0|Baraka will remain my favourite... even though this dvd is on blue ray with more visual effects! For not a specific reason, i couldn't get connected with this movie.
B00BEIYLAW|3.0|A great many words can be used to describe the late Steve Jobs.  Atop the list, you'd probably find innovator and visionary, followed by several harsher words that there's no need to use here.  His contributions to the technology industry are undeniable, and while he clearly had a life full of conflict, history will always remember him as the man that started a technology revolution by co-founding the multi-billion dollar company, Apple.  Today, a rough estimate projects Apple to be worth in the ballpark of $600-700 billion.  And, the odds are (since you're reading this) that you probably own a piece of technology that Steve Jobs oversaw at one point - whether it's an iPhone, iPod, Mac, or one of several other forms of Apple technology.  For all his flaws and rocky relationships, Steve Jobs managed to found a company, lose his place in it, and come back to make it bigger and better than ever.  These real life events are chronicled in the biopic, Jobs.<br /><br />Directed by Joshua Michael Stern (Swing Vote), Jobs stars Ashton Kutcher as the ambitious technology marketer, Steve Jobs.  The film begins with Steve Jobs introducing the iPod in 2001, and quickly shifting to his free spiritedness as a young man during his college years.  After dropping out, Steve becomes involved with Steve Wozniak - a tech guru that has been working on a personal computer.  Together, Jobs and Wozniak - along with a handful of others, begin their quest to build a company, called Apple, from the ground up.  After the initial success of Apple, business and egos come into play as Jobs struggles to find his way in his own company.  J.K. Simmons, Matthew Modine, and Lukas Hass also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />At first, Ashton Kutcher feels like an odd choice to portray Steve Jobs.  However, Kutcher will eventually grow on you, despite his slightly irritating attempt to emulate Steve Jobs' ticks and movements.  Drama is not Kutcher's strong suit, and probably never will be, but that doesn't mean his portrayal of Jobs is any less entertaining.  For the people that actually knew Jobs, it's their job (no pun intended) to nitpick about whether this is an honest portrayal of the actual man himself.  Jobs' death was only a short two years ago, so there's plenty of tape out there that Kutcher had the ability to study.  Regardless, it's pretty safe to say Kutcher's portrayal of the driven, yet easily angry innovator is not so much of a questionable acting job as it is a question of whether or not Jobs was portrayed honestly and fairly.  To the people that produced this film, they'll say Kutcher was right on the money.  Others that actually worked with Jobs have criticized Kutcher's portrayal as being a bit off.  In any event, and as far as this film goes, Kutcher's portrayal provides for high entertainment value (which is the point of a film) - especially in specific scenes, including one in which he's chewing out Bill Gates' voicemail.<br /><br />Like all biopics, it's difficult to fully incorporate every meaningful moment of someone's life in two hours.  Jobs starts at a point that allows Kutcher to pass as a young college student, frankly because he still looks like a twenty year old (and usually acts like one in most of his roles, too).  From there, this film covers the most groundbreaking and strenuous moments of Jobs' life, including the moment he chose to avoid his responsibility as a parent and his constant battles with Apple's Board of Directors.  Sadly, this script (penned by Matt Whiteley) is notable for all of things that it doesn't include, instead of the moments it does include.  The most difficult moments in the final years of his life - fighting cancer - are completely avoided, leaving years of emotional experiences out of the film.<br /><br />Today, people know Steve Jobs for his involvement overseeing modern technology.  However, these technical works of art and their worldwide success are only touched upon briefly (except the iPhone), while the majority of the film focuses on Jobs' spats with the people around him and his supposed \\"flaws.\\"  Kutcher's portrayal leaves Steve Jobs looking like a man that had all the ideas and had everything figured out, but in reality he had very little to do with the actual implementation of Apple products.  He spent most of his time perfecting and then marketing other people's work - a point several former employees, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak are on record pointing out.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also quite enjoyable, featuring Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak - a portrayal that is slightly inaccurate as it portrays Jobs as more a commanding figure in their friendship when that wasn't necessarily always the case.  Still, Gad does an excellent job depicting Wozniak, despite the implication that Wozniak was nothing more than a sidekick.  And, if a film needs to have a corporate villain, there's really no one better to play the part than J.K. Simmons - portraying Arthur Rock.  In the film, Rock is the Apple Board member that outmaneuvers Steve Jobs and pushes him out of his role of power, leading to Jobs' resignation from Apple.  Simmons, like the real life Rock, perceived Jobs as a ticking time bomb and felt it was better to push him out before he sank the ship.  Naturally, we now know Jobs was the saving grace and removing him from power is what fast-tracked Apple to its desperate decline before Jobs eventually rejoined the company in 1996.<br /><br />Overall, Jobs is an opinionated film that depicts Steve Jobs as a bit of an evil genius that had a great deal of vision, but didn't know how to maintain working relationships.  True or not, this depiction of Jobs makes for interesting filmmaking, and will inspire viewers to do their own investigating into the man that helped revolutionize personal technology.  Ashton Kutcher is sustaining in his role as Steve Jobs, carrying the role from Jobs' college years through to the 1997 \\"Think different\\" advertising campaign.  However the film leaves out a great many important moments in the life of Steve Jobs, and includes several falsities.  While this is only one film's version of Jobs' life, it still tells an entertaining, made for Hollywood story of how Jobs was perceived during the years of Apple's formation and beyond.  But, the contributions of Steve Jobs are undeniably important, making it difficult to say what the world would look like today if Jobs were not the man he turned out to be.<br /><br />Grade:  C+<br />FNDNreview.comhile the majority of the film focuses on Jobs' spats with the people around him and his supposed \\"flaws.\\"  Kutcher's portrayal leaves Steve Jobs looking like a man that had all the ideas and had everything figured out, but in reality he had very little to do with the actual implementation of Apple products.

B005HEPJBY|5.0|Star Trek The Next Generation has really grown it's &#34;Rikers beard&#34; in the fourth season. This season is a perfect mix of dramatic episodes and lighthearted ones. I also think it's really cool how Riker continues to pass up promotion to Captain his own ship in order to work under Picard. Great show to watch at night when you're looking for something to engage you on an intellectual level.
0143039482|5.0|Reading the title, I would have never suspected the storyline or plot.  What a wonderful surprise.  From John Steinbeck I would have expected no less.  Good Work.

B0088W7VNG|5.0|If you are a fan of science fiction and have not yet watched this Stargate series, you really don't know what you've been missing.  This is by far the best of all the Stargate spin-off series. SG-1 was great, SG Universe was good,  but this 5 season series is out of this world awesome. I should know, I have watched the entire 5 season series twice... and will do it again some day.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood is one very outstanding singer, I love the songs Leave Love Alone, Forever Changed and of course the its Blown Away and 2 Black Cadillacs.  She has not stopped since she won American Idol and as good as she is and as pretty as she is, I think she will be around for quite some time.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|He takes you into his world, and you start living and breathing the characters until you finish the novel. Right from the story of Baba Ayub, you just enter into this world. Once I started, I had to finish it as soon as possible. I could not sleep properly for few days because of this book, and now my wife is going through it.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert<br />I just found one loophole in the book. If Idris and his Cousin were such good friends with Abdullah, why they never discussed where they came from and why did Abdullah never tried to find about Pari and Neela from them.
0321934318|4.0|Scott's approach is to get you started on the right track. I know so many photographers who launch Lightroom, fiddle around and learn very little about the power of the program. Follow this book from beginning to end and you will be very satisfied....and most important, you will get the most out of the program.

I also love that the weather is displayed to Very happy after looking at tons of clock apps that I got this one free but upgraded to get rid of all the adds and have the ability to play/use my own music Would recommend this alarm clock app to anyone
B005OCFHHK|2.0|I've only watched the first movie so far but both picture and sound are suprisingly very poor for blu-ray.<br /><br />Also these films are NOT 1.78 to 1 aspect ratio like they are advertized.

B007CI81IQ|5.0|Written in a very easy a colloquial manner, it changed my perspective on how the problem of poverty is being addressed around the world. By giving good examples backed with fair to good evidence drawn from randomized trials as done in medicine, it exhibits certain policies that are making a difference and others assumed to be good that are not making much of a difference. Before, I had an ambivalent opinion towards handout programs such as the &#34;Red de oportunidades&#34; started by the previous administration in Panama or &#34;beca universal&#34; from this administration. But soon I realized that these are reasonable policies that have evidence to back them.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Easy read. Seems accurate enough but certainly romanticized version of Elizabeth of York's marriage to Henry Tudor. An interesting take on royal imposters.
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|Being the first book in the series, this book should hook you in and make you want to continue with the series.<br /><br />There is no hook. None. No explanation of any of the various systems of magic. No explanation of any of the factions. It's like the author intentionally went out of the way to avoid giving the reader any kind of clue. Some how you are suppose to dive into this world with complete knowledge of its history.<br /><br />I read a review that said by book 3 or 4 in the series, you'll start understanding what was happening in book 1... Again, book 1 should be the hook. Why in the world would you read 3 more books of a series when the first one purposefully drives you away?<br /><br />My main regret with this book is that I bought it for Kindle, and therefore don't have a physical copy of it to burn/stomp/piss on.<br /><br />Save your money and steer clear of this frustrating mess.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is the best magic game I have ever played good job guy better then the xbox version I give 10 thumbs up

B0087GF8ZG|3.0|Not as bright as I expected, but adequate in a closet with a ceiling too high to reach a switch.  Otherwise, I'd say go with the RiteLite LPL704 which I also bought and prefer.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|Good game.  Not very complicated but it passes the time and relieves stress.  There are no characters shown and the game only references the story.  If you know the story, it's fun.  If you don't, it can be confusing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was required to read this book for school, and the emotions you have while reading it are so strong. The amount of thought and work in this book has not gone unnoticed. This book is really great.<br /><br />I just wish it wasn't so depressing xD
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I recently got the Chromecast and have been pleasantly surprised by it's simplicity and quality.  I have been able to stream from my phone and laptop with ease, and it didn't eat up the batterylife on either.  Set up was pretty simple, and just have to make sure you are on the same network so can stream.  When casting items from laptop, cursor doesn't show, but that can be a plus.  Wish I could stream more stuff from phone, but hopefully that will come later.  Overall, very happy with value for Chromecast.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is an absolutely hilarious (in the British sense of the word) zombie movie! Simon Pegg plays Shaun to perfection and the supporting cast is fantastic (including the ever-present Bill Nighy). Shaun is slow to catch on that half the population has turned into zombies...even one of his flatmates, but when it finally sinks in, it makes for lots of fun. He is trying to get his girlfriend back in the midst of fighting zombies and saving the people he loves. Excellent movie!

Harvey and his &#34;protege&#34; couldn't be more alike and more different at the same time. The situations they encounter are filled with a good mix of drama and comedy, hard-line tacks and sympathetic feelings. Hated to see the seson end and am eagerly anticipating Season 2.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|How truly are individuals able to reach the pinnacles of the worldly human experience? Is it by sheer luck? Yes. Is it by sheer ability? Also the affirmative. While one may argue Gladwell could arrive at his conclusions in perfect hindsight. It is the challenging of our conventional wisdom regarding the factors of success which make this something to pick up.<br /><br />Also I surely won't think of riding on an airplane the same.

014241543X|3.0|I don't remember where I read that this was a great book to read before it gets turned into a movie, but somebody recommended it, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />It was a quick read, meant for a younger audience. I didn't realize it was a series, so I will not be finding out what happens in the life of the main character. It takes on an interesting perspective of a girl in a coma and flashbacks from her life about the people that surround her. It was a little melancholy, but I guess we all had a bit of angst as a teenager.<br /><br />I think I am outside of the target demographic to find it interesting enough to read the rest of the books.

0385344228|1.0|I bought this book because it \\"sounded good.\\" Was hoping for a writer like Jodi Picoult, whose novels about personal relationships between family members are honest, believable and ring true as bells.<br />This author doesn't even begin to come close to the quality Picoult brings to her novels. His central characters -- the Barber family -- never came to life for me. Landay's dialogues are stilted, stiff and bear no resemblance whatsoever to the way people, especially husbands/wives and parents/children actually talk to one another. The story drags and is all over the place. I could barely force myself to finish this book. Very disappointing, because the concept was good; Landay simply dropped the ball with this.

B000002J1L|4.0|First, I want to review the album (which is incredible), and after that I want to tell you about my experience purchasing this on auto rip. This is the first album with The Progressive lineup of Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford, Tony Banks, Phil Collins first album, and Steve Hackett's first album with the band. There are a lot of great elements here. The opening track, Musical Box is one of my favorite Genesis tracks of all time. Giant Hogweed has a musical and lyrical quirkiness to it that make me crack up. Harold the Barel is another quirky little tune that is intriguing to the ear. I could give a track by track review but that would get boring. What I will tell you is that Genesis gets a lot better after this album. This is a very good progressive rock album, but by Gabriel era standards this is one of their weaker albums (which doesn't mean it's not incredible). Selling England By The Pound, Foxtrot, and Lamb are better. I like Gabriel era Genesis better than Phil Collins era Genesis, but I have to say I do like Trick of the Tail better than this one as well. It's a really good album but they are growing as artists.<br /><br />  I purchased this album on auto-rip and I had a lot of trouble with it. I had an older version of this album in my cloud library, and auto rip took it upon itself to used part of my old purchase as my new MP3 file. So I had a mix of the new remaster and the older version.  This made for an uneven listening experience. Amazon fixed this by crediting me the musical box track, but this took a lot of effort on my part to turn this around. However, in the end they did the right thing.<br /><br />  My suggestion to anyone using the auto rip function is to delete any older version of the album from your cloud library first (save it on an external hard drive or something just in case). The Amazon system will be much less likely to glitch if you do that.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|After reading and enjoying so much Fall of Giants, the trilogy's first installment, I was thrilled to read the follow up. It's an easy reading and inevitably you find yourself immersed in the story. But it lacks the subtleties of Fall of Giants and its characters are conventional and schematic, almost predictable. Good reading, but not a masterwork.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|I've watched it twice now, great Movie lot of action and great plot.Tom Cruise is great in the Movie, Great!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It took awhile to get into this book.  I really wanted to read it before I watched the movie.  I still want to see the movie but the book was difficult to get through.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is just like temple run and subway surfer but even more fun you can be a bunch of different characters I recommend this app for everyone
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I bought this app for my little boy to download construction videos from you tube. It worked amazing, now it has stopped working and I can't get it to do anything. PLease I paid for this app, please make it work or refund my money.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I'd recommend &#34;Mud&#34; to anyone who enjoys reality like drama.  He's an awfully nice guy for a killer. Four Stars
B005K17RU0|5.0|I continue to be impressed with the professional quality of AccuWeather.  I highly recommend it!  The app works fast and its User friendliness is a refreshing change.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You can't put it down. And then you HAVE to buy Mockingjay.<br />Damn you, Suzanne Collins, for writing such an engaging book. The Hunger Games was really just the beginning.<br />I'm off to get the third book in the trilogy!
B00AL6SM0S|5.0|The performances are in the grand Wagner style with sweep, color and verve.  The sound is surprisingly vivid and clear.
B005KDWUFA|4.0|I now have all Il Divo tapes!!!! I will continue to enjoy them all -- and will look forward to each new one that comes about.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Bought the book because I fell in live with the show. Not dissapointed by the book, even a bit glad that it had differences from the show.
1476733953|5.0|I read a lot of books and, beginning from a young age, many of those have been from the Science Fiction genre.  For me, the best Sci-Fi novels are the ones written around a simple idea, followed by a \\"what if\\" kind of story.  With Wool, Hugh Howey has created an instant classic that does exactly that.  Think Enders Game, or The Forever War.  High praise?  Yes indeed, and well deserved.<br /><br />Wool is part human drama, part Sci-Fi, and part sleuthing novel.  Hugh Howey presents a post-apocalyptical story with a twist, but keeps the reader engaged by doling out clues to the greater mystery in a classic detective novel manner.  Highly entertaining and worth all the great reviews.  Bravo to a new writer destined to enter the canon of modern Sci-Fi masters.
1469259192|5.0|I loved this book, perfect amount of suspense and romance and drama.  I can't wait to read the next one!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I'm in the age group that would enjoy this movie.  It has limited appeal for younger people, but we enjoy the great acting of the mature players.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Use this every night very handy and portability is great. I especially like the Times music section where you can play your own or the classic white noise sound it comes with.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I highly recommend this book, as well as others by this Author.  They are well written and have great characters.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|It is a let of fun too play so don't stop playing this game share the app with friends and family-friendly
B009NQZVKG|5.0|As always, Rollins delivers! Keeps you captivated right from the beginning. I am a big Sigma fan, can't wait for the next one!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I love this book, it reminds of someone so very special to me,I could not put it down. Great job Jill
B00062IDCO|5.0|awesome show good quality acting a true asset to the star trek universe.  would love to see a voyager movie following up with the careers of the crew
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I got this cd for the song on top of the world which little league is using right now I loved the song as soon as I herd it I love the rest of the songs to I hope this group does more cds I would buy them
B0069JBKHI|1.0|wow is this thing bad!  totally unreliable - difficult to configure - barely connects to the network and horrible, horrible slow customer support from withings...oh, and did I mention the errors using the iphone app are either in French or you cannot even understand them.  stay away from this product.  It is so bad that I will have to buy a separate baby monitor - this thing cannot be trust to monitor a baby.
038572179X|4.0|After reading \\"Humboldt's Gift\\", I was looking for a lighter and quicker read. \\"Atonement\\" has met my expectations.  For some unexplained reason, I seem to very much enjoy novels that take place in Britain, especially pre-WWII Britain. (I also have an unexplained interest in British History.)<br /><br />The novel follows the aftermath of a false accusation by a young upper-class girl, which results in the imprisonment of Robbie Turner, her sister's lover. Naturally, this result leads to an unexpected chain of events. Frankly, I found the plot somewhat far-fetched and not fully believable, though it didn't really diminish my enjoyment. McEwan's skill as a writer is superb and he is a truly gifted storyteller. He managed perfectly the flow of the novel. \\"Atonement\\" is a quite an enjoyable summer read.
0670026557|5.0|Adam Grant does a masterful job in this book.  It is a must read for anyone in business.  I bought a bunch of these and gave them to givers in my life!
B007JCP8FE|5.0|You can't go wrong with any Shinedown CD.  I love their music and Brent Smith's voice is amazing as always!  Definitely recommend this CD!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The app is great to use. Works like the website. Easy to manuver. Would recommend it to anyone. Love it!
B0034G4P94|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line of this movie.  Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy were GREAT, I thought.  Nick Nolte did a pretty good job as well.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes fight movies.  Especially movies with a storyline!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The app is great to use. Works like the website. Easy to manuver. Would recommend it to anyone. Love it!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|The actors gave very good performances.  Mud has had an on-again off-again relationship since childhood that makes him do stupid things.  The closest thing to a father he has ever know is tired of his obsession with this woman and the trouble she causes.  Mud comes back to his hometown to hide out until he can take his woman away with him.  Two local boys find him on a nearby deserted island and barter to help him make his get away in exchange for an item in his possession.  The boys have their own problems to deal with as well.  I really enjoyed the interaction between Mud and the boys.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I came, I saw, it was worth watching.  Will I watch it again.  No.  But, worth the rental for a mellow, low key night.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Loved this book from beginning to end.  Can't wait for the next one in the series!<br />The author artfully crafts his imaginary world and the reader is pulled into it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I loved this movie from start to finish.  Watched it twice in during the rental period.  It's kinda gruesome, but exactly what I expected from Tarantino.  Gory fun for the whole family to enjoy.
B008KHRODG|5.0|Came quickly, and every episode is wonderful (which I already knew). The End of Time, Parts One & Two are two of my favorite episodes from the Tennant years. The Waters of Mars is a little more on the cheesy side, so be prepared for that, but every episode is wonderful all the same. If you love Doctor Who, get this for your collection!
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|My 8 year old LOVED this movie.  Fortunately this was fun for the whole family... even the parents... and the girls.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app was great when I got it but then I tried to play a video and it said this may take  a moment and then it never loaded. This app doesn't work for me anymore
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very much enjoyed this movie.  The kids loved it and I loved that there was a deeper meaning to it.  You'll have to watch it to see!
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh has once again created a beautiful collection of songs...His voice is like peace and relaxation blended with a powerful rich sense of contentment. I have 6 of his CDs and they all showcase his incredible vocal range.my favorite songs are. You are loved. And So she dances
B004XANKVO|5.0|This is the absolute best backpack I've ever purchased.  Used by my teenage son, who could care less about where he plops or throws it!  It has survived freshman year, and I've no need to replace going into 10th grade.  Pricey and well worth it.
B004TI5N38|5.0|A page turner!  ThIs was  good story, as usual.  The character development was well done also.  I highly recommend  this Baldacci Monel.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|WE ARE BIG FANS OF CRIMINAL MINDS AND LOVE EVERY SEASON AND HAVE PURCHASED EVERY SEASON TOO.  WE MAKE IT A FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT AND CAN WATCH THEM OVER AND OVER.
0385523394|4.0|Got this for my girlfriend. She can't stop reading it. It's great. Gives me time to myself. Hopefully she will want to go to prison now. That'd be great. Then I could get a sex change and join her and be shower buddies. She likes the book. Different from the show I guess. I don't care. Like I said, keeps the girlfriend out of my face. 4 stars for that right there.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoyed this family saga.  I cannot wait for season four.  I wish I could say everything I want to say, but I cannot give away some very vital information regarding the finale of season 3.  What a shocker!  A must see!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I have only tested it, haven't used it fully, but it works great with my iphone 3g, no adapters needed and the recording sounds great.
B009NY43NY|2.0|A disappointing conclusion to the series, which admittedly had been getting less enjoyable anyways. As a fan of the series, I felt obligated to buy and read this book in spite of the terrible reviews just to get some closure on the characters. I agree with many of the other reviewers that the wrap up was unsatisfying, applied a stale formula and the resolution for many of the characters seemed inconsistent with the characters. Check it out at the library, if you must, but it really isn't worth the money.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|Sit back and just laugh. The voices are great, the animation is fun. I am a big collector of DC animated movies and memorabilia. This is my first Lego Movie and will not be the last. Fun story.
B000ITF86E|4.0|I have been a fan of both John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara for a long time - they are excellent together. This film is predictable, but well made, and has something in it for everyone. Raises some issues - racial prejudice - but doesn't go very far into it. Well worth watching!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I wish these game developers would confer with the audience they are targeting when they decide to make a new game. The game is good but they should stick with the best parts of the original and add new designs based on our opinions and suggestions.
0061950726|5.0|I'm reading this for my neighborhood book club.  The story is great and well written.  It held my interest from page 1 to the very end.  Not a story I knew about either so found that interesting.  It is a &#34;war&#34; story but told from a different point of view.  I give it a thumbs up review and recommend it.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Enjoyed the HD remix of this classic.  I enjoy the romance and era that this move is set in.  Each time I watch this movie I enoy it more than the time before.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone.  My book club selected it. I had never heard of it.  I finished it in two days! It was awesome. Such a beautiful story and so well written.
B00COCY67A|2.0|I really thought it was going to be a quality DVD.  It basically is a recording made by a small, low quality, pirated, video.  Since it is a DVD I really expected a lot more from it and was basically disappointed.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|What a GREAT MOVIE!! Please watch it with someone who isn't going to annoyed you!! Too good to miss out.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|My little boy likes birds a this movie feels like it was made for him. He loves it and I enjoyed watching it as well!
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|I have been looking at this movie for months thinking about watching it but hesitant because I thought I would be disappointed.  I have always loved SciFi but there are some pretty bad movies out there.  I was quite pleasantly suprised and really enjoyed this movie.  Seemed a little slow at first while setting up the scenario but then it moved quickly through the rest of the movie.  Worth watching.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The season starts off strong, and it finishes....strong.  Great writing, acting, directing.  The music is fantastic, and Highclere Castle is the most awesome film location of all time.  Just all around a fantastic escape for an hour at a time.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|The only negative is that when printing an item from email or the web you have to go through the app and find your email or web page a second time in order to print the information.  Otherwise when you use the app the way it was designed it is quite nice to be able to print from your phone or tablet wireless.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I needed ES file Explorer to run the Course Smart app for ebooks. It took longer to set up than most apps, but I'm saving a lot of money on my textbooks.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I have no complaints.  It keeps my kindle protected and is easy to open/close.  The stand is convenient for when I pull up a recipe from a website and stand it up in the kitchen to read the recipe while I'm cooking.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Novels are like good wine. The environment and timing of a good read is important to ones perception of the book.<br />I was not in a great time in my life and struggled to finish his book.<br />I didn't think it was as good as Kite Runner.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Good series, first and second were my favorites, but looking forward to the next installment.  This book had an unexpected ending that made me excited for the next one.
B00006LJ72|1.0|This is a compilation set of CDs in a purple, crush velvet case that would have been a beautiful gift for my wife had it not been for the damage caused by poor packing.<br />This company put the other CDs that I ordered in the same envelope without protection between them and the CDs dug into the crush velvet case leaving deep indentions which were not readily visible when the cellophane was still on the package.<br />When I contacted them they told me that they could do something about it as long as the package wasn't opened but I didn't find the damage (to the crush velvet) until it was unwrapped.<br />There were also indentions of numbers from someone using the case for something to write on like a note pad. You can clearly make out numbers and number symbols. I am very disappointed in this order.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game if you love horses it' is fun to care for them and keeps you busy when you are bored YOU will love it
B000050XEI|5.0|This is a wonderful selection of songs and I was delighted to receive it in NEW condition.<br />This is a MUST for Enya fans.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|this app is great you can play so many songs even the song of healing from legend of Zelda but the only complaint I have is that there is no song of storms in it but overall great and free!!
B004V73FGE|4.0|The Light bikes and storyline was solid. Could have done a little more with the characters but well worth seeing.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|entertaining and very changeling i would recommend this game<br />it keeps you entertain for hours this is my type of game
B0017QSZW6|4.0|While she wasn't an angel.  Her husband, as hot as he is, is insane.  They seemed like a match made in heaven.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Yes, I like the game. Once you start, you better have some time to kill... Keep an eye on your sharks energy level.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|This has the beauty of animation and the suspense of a thriller. The entire movies keep us on the edge of the seat, and keeps the audience guessing. It is a little different from Herge's Books though. Overall its a good movie and also, hilariously points out some stereotypical situations.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|What a great read. For those of you who liked the farseer trilogy, this book starts off the \\"second\\" farseer trilogy.<br /><br />The series revolves around the fit chivalry and the fool and finishes their story quite well
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The book started off appealing to me.  As it went along I kept waiting for it to &#34;get good.&#34;. It didn't seem to ever develop into something bigger or important.  I kept wanting a moment that would really set it all off but it never came.  That said, it certainly wasn't bad and does introduce some interesting concepts and ideas.  Would I recommend it?  No.  Would I tell someone who is in the middle of it to just stop now?  No.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|It is a funny movie, and it is clean. Nothing scary in it. Good for all ages.  Worth the money.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|This movie was very action packed and typical Bruce Willis excitement.  Truly enjoyed this movie.  Definitely recommend it to all.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|It is a funny movie. Good for all ages.  A family movie.  It is a clean movie.  Worth the money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the acting and character development.  It is a bit &#34;soap opera-ish&#34; but still enjoyable.  Look forward to Season 4.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I just cant stop listening to this. Best rock album in years. This should win best in all award shows.
030758836X|2.0|i couldnt even finish the book, it was too depressing. the characters took too long to evolve so i just let someone else read it and they liked it.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I bought 3 of these back in Dec. 2012 for $8.64 each...not because I'm psychic and knew that they would jump up to $40 but because they are so craptastic that I have to treat them as &#34;disposable.&#34; How disposable?  Well, it's 8 months later, and I was about to order replacements as I am on #3 of that set.  I use them for jogging....estimate 40 hours per week of outdoor use.  As much of a spendthrift as I may be, $40 for these is so outrageous that I just can't.  And you shouldn't, either....unless the price hike is only temporary, but I guess that it is a sign that these aren't being made anymore?  If the price does drop again, only buy if you are looking for something cheap to use for working out or the like.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love love love. What fun I've had getting lost in the dark and loving intrigue of this adventure. Thank you for keeping Malcolm alive.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|i downloaded this app for my child about a month ago for his kindle fire. it has never opened and hasn't worked at all. it just says downloading and then returns to the home screen
B00005M91K|5.0|All of Ron Fricke's movie's are fantastic. They tell a story without words that is more dynamic than words! Great!!
B00BR476TG|4.0|Great movie.  Don't miss it. The narrative and photography will keep you guessing.  The story is compelling and will give you a lot to consider.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Loved how the story unfolds from so many angles- truly spellbound- couldn't read it fast enough and was disappointed to run out of pages at the end of the book
B00005UW9T|3.0|This animated musical film version of Anastasia by Twentieth Century Fox from 1997, though having some truth to it, is for the most part a wholesome but fictional entertainment classic. The animation and music are wonderful. But this film simply does not tell the true story of the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicholaevna Romanova who, along with her family, was murdered in 1918 by the Communists following the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. The final truth of her death was not confirmed until 2009.
B0047VSW30|4.0|There have been several accounts regarding the events that led to the destruction of one of the greatest treasuries of thought in the ancient world: The Great Library at Alexandria. In Agora, we see this conflagration aligned with a degree by the Coptic Pope Theophilus; a plausible though not highly-competitive theory. Rachel Weisz plays the role of Hypatia, a beloved and intelligent mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher. In a patriarchal society, she encounters her share of friction, but she cannot overcome the strong pulls from the diametrically opposed political factions: the occupying Romans, the expanding population of over zealous Christians, and even her own local government administration led by a would-be-jilted former childhood associate. Toss in an unrequited love, and you have enough sexual tension and political upheaval to rival any modern day story of consternation. I enjoyed the epic-quality of the movie, which showcased large panoramic views of ancient Alexandria, and the Great Library itself can legitimately be considered its own character. There are scenes with the famous lighthouse as well, one of the wonders of the ancient world. A movie that is \\"not for everyone,\\" but if you enjoy history and/or like movies about ancient Rome, this one does not disappoint.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Words cannot begin to describe the in depth drama that is in this show.  It touches on almost every single thing imaginable within a motorcycle club/gang.  Each show has a nice, easy flow to it that goes right in to the next one.  PERFECT! Not to mention that the &#34;bad boys&#34; of SOA and Katey Sagal's character, Gemma, make it worth every minute!
B002OR0RP0|5.0|To quote the Flintstones &#34;yabba dabba doo,&#34;<br />Pardon my type ohs. Better than the previous one! Keep them coming, please!<br />I highly recommend it!
B009GX6600|5.0|Since it's inception NCIS has been a must see for me every Tuesday.  After a couple of 4 star seasons this past season has been one of the best.  Even with the loss of Ziva (Cote de Pablo) in the upcoming season I'm hoping that the best season of all is yet to come.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great hilarious movie! With a lot of cute characters! I would highly recommend it! Well worth the money! Fun and funny!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I read a review from a senior citizen saying this was a good way to keep your mind sharp and being older myself thought I should try it..  Really like it.  Lots of fun.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Even though Star Trek: Voyager was one of my all time favorite TV series I had never seen the first season.  It did not disappoint. I'm currently watching season 2 and am excited to revisit my friends aboard the Starship Voyager.  There is not one character in this series that I can imagine doing without... And the doctor's own unique brand of humor brings needed levity to what are usually serious situations.  So be sure to &#34;Engage&#34;,  you won't be sorry.
B00933ZIF2|5.0|It is rare to find entertainment of this quality in today's video market. This show is a gem. Amazing acting, intriguing story lines and a very authentic feel. Sometimes the plot lines go off a bit as to common sense and reason, but hey, it is fiction and very good fiction at that.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I'm actually pleasantly surprised at how fun this really is. Very simple game with great graphics. I downloaded it more for my son but had fun trying it out.
0156027321|5.0|I only bought this book because I need a grade for it. I did not know I would love the book so much. I'm glad it came. This was my first purchase from Amazon, and I believe this is the purchase that made me continue to shop here.
0525425772|5.0|Though this book probably was intended for middle school children, it is a great read for adults too. This is the third book in the series and I have enjoyed all of them.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|Love the show, music, and the comedy. The whole family enjoy it. Family time is always a great time for all
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|it was ok but nothing great, I guess you must know and love opera, or this was just a movie about old people trying to save their retirement home.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a very interesting book with amazing imagination by the writer, Rick Riordan. it is a must read book
044656740X|1.0|I didn't realize this is just a long ad for buying into this dude's pyramid scheme. I just learned but gladly I only spent a couple bucks to make it happen. If you want to get pissed off at an unscrupulous profiteer, buy this!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much I play every day addicting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will love it too my friend of awesomeness
B009OYTAL8|5.0|This is a great series. Fun to watch with an interesting story line. Of course, I never read comic books so I don't know how true it is to the source material. It's just fun!
B0000PCUDK|5.0|I loved this album growing up and hearing now, like this, ... damnit, i'm giddy :) This SACD is brilliant.
B00B9YDT5Y|5.0|An excellent collection of Simple Minds. A special song dedicated to Nelson Mandela, to me a man that is a lesson for the world. God bless you.
0374533555|5.0|While the title is accurate, the book is really about how we process information and make decisions.  There are many studies cited with results that people will find counter-intuitive if they are new to cognitive studies.<br /><br />Book is definitely worth buying if you have any interest in how people process information.
B005MAHWN6|5.0|Already knew the music of Karen Souza, a great voice and very good musicians that accompany this work. I once again congratulate me with the speed and efficiency in sending the cds importcds.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Love OneRepublic. Counting Stars is the best song on this one. I also like If I Lose MySelf, Feel Again, What You Wanted and all the others.<br /><br />I just paid $7.99 when I purchase this 4 days ago.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|Eliane is perhaps the most representative of Brazil in the jazz world. A voice very sensual and striking. Thank you.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great fun, very addictivde .easy to play, my only complaint is that the enegy does not . Last very long.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very engaging puzzle... I like the ones that make you think and recall where that last piece was. Great art work as well.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The characters just keep growing on you. The relationships formed are so loyal and genuine. Just hate it when one gets taken away.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|This video will be helpful for teaching students about screening or chemical dependency and the challenges faced by those who are chemically dependent.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Loved it! Science fiction at its best. I want more movies like this. Tom Criuse did a good job in this one.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|it doesn't load very fast force quits and resarts very slow on notifications and messages, which dont show up for a quite while. good thing its free i wouldn't pay any money for this app. i have a kindle hd 7 not sure if thats the problem. on occasion some days its good!!! as in i get my messages when sent too me and messages are sent bye me i can see them instead of previous messages disappearing and then force closing and the dreaded lag of about an hour or two just to get to be able to see a profile pic then another crash maybe its also the area im at. idk but you have alot of bugzs i like em fixed but idk if you have the man power to do that and the f#$@ing ads s#&amp;$ too. just concerned you guys are in over your head.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like the &quot;tag&quot; feature of this app.  My favorite tag is &quot;memory&quot;.  All those little sticky notes all over the house are now in my memory folder.  I have two computers and two kindles that I use for different tasks and I can access. Evermore from each electronic.  I love that I can email things to Evernote and even tag them by putting the tag file name and # at the end of the subject line.  I can customize my tags for My brain organization.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Enjoyed this book.  Likely a great read for anyone who has lost a loved one or possibly struggling with their own possible death due to age or illness
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love these little guys. App has wonderful graphics and fun levels. My kids have played it continuously. Would recommend to kids and adults...fun fun fun
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is a fun game to play. I recommend it. It allows you to play with others and challenges you to win. Download the game and enjoy.
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|The first 3/4 of the movie made me think it could end with a twist or something special. Instead, the went for the cliche Hollywood ending that was completely pointless.

B009GEPBA0|4.0|The real James bond stood tall in this one. Entertaining and with just enough sex and violence to make it fun for pretty much all ages.
B00881VLCE|4.0|ENJOY THIS APP VERY MUCH...LOVE THE PUZZLES THAT LOOK LIKE PHOTOS. HAVE BOUGHT MANY. ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE NUMBER OF PIECES OFFERED AT TIMES AND NO WAY TO CHANGE IT SO MUST WAIT. LOVELY!
0761172726|5.0|This calendar works for our family, allowing us to see everyone's schedules at a glance on the way from the kitchen outside.  Love the colorful drawings and space for 5 family members activities, with stickers for a bit of fun.  Both my kids are in college now and we are still finding it helpful.  Everyone knows to &#34;check the calendar&#34; when there are questions about scheduling.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This is a great game. It has over a billions of clothing and non stop action. It's the greatest addictive game ever! I'm a show this to my brother.
B007ZYK3CE|3.0|This is really a five star movie, but it was just too dark for me. There is only so much suffering I can stand in a movie. This exceeds it. Never finished it, maybe it had a happy ending, I'll never know.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is very entertaining and highly addictive. Just wish there were more than ten levels.<br />Please release more levels soon.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|I just started watching Castle earlier this year and downloaded last season to get caught up for the fall episodes.  There are 24 episodes which was a great deal!
0307352153|3.0|I confess that I very much enjoyed reading this book, and that during the time I was reading it, I talked about it quite a bit. I am a pretty introverted person myself, with three very introverted children who have suffered in an educational system built for talkers and self-promoters. It was eye-opening and affirming to become acquainted with some of the research that argues against open work spaces and other workspace and school fads that serve our culture's increasingly extroverted ideal. In many ways, I should have been the perfect reader for this book. I agree with its premise, that our world has tilted too far in the direction of valuing extroversion, and I want to support the correction that this book represents.<br /><br />But Cain is a lawyer turned journalist, not a trained psychologist. Despite references throughout to some of the psychological literature, this is basically an extended piece of fluff journalism based on personal experience and interviews. Ultimately it lacks depth, thoughtfulness, rigor, and subtlety. I was especially turned off by the breezy new-journalistic style, which reflects the fundamental simplifications and stereotypes on which this book rests. Take the case of \\"Greg and Emily,\\" an extrovert married to an introvert described in Chapter 10 (\\"The Communication Gap\\"), attempting to make good on the promise that \\"opposites attract\\": \\"Greg, who just turned thirty, has a bounding gait, a mop of dark hair continually falling over his eyes, and an easy laugh.... Emily, a mature twenty-seven, is as self-contained as Greg is expansive. Graceful and soft-spoken, she keeps her auburn hair tied in a chignon, and often gazes at people from under lowered lashes.\\" Seriously? There is just no way to get to a subtle analysis when your basic observations are such a clich&eacute;.<br /><br />I was also turned off occasionally by Cain's unself-reflective political bias. It bothered me only a little when she was lionizing Gandhi and Eleanor Roosevelt(the introvert to Franklin's extrovert). But when she started in on Al Gore (\\"combine that passion for thought with attention to subtlety--both common characteristics of introverts--and you get a very powerful mix\\"), I started to feel a little sick. Cain succumbs to a division of the world into two distinct personality types (even when she tries to complicate it) that ends up reflecting her own prejudgments and partisanship.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|this game is super easy and it's fun to play, sorta kinda addicting! Bubble touch is well worth the price.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|So you're looking for an alarm clock - reading the reviews, checking out the demos.  Don't waste any more of your time.  This is the one you're looking for.  It works well, and has the features that you need.<br /><br />Period.<br /><br />End of discussion.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|If you watch this, you must also watch the 4 David Tennet Specials, also available here on Amazon.<br /><br />This season confuses almost all story arcs from the first four seasons.<br />I enjoyed the development of the doctor and his friends more than anything.<br /><br />And not to put any spoilers, but Rose!<br /><br />Watch it, you will enjoy it if you've seen the first three seasons.
B00942Y4IY|3.0|Nice effects, great high concept idea, but weak story telling. Passes the time, but if you've got something better to do, do that instead.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Nick Cage and Meg Ryan are perfection in this movie about love, loss and choice. Sad ending, but it shows life not fairy-tail.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It was a great season. Funny, sad, drama, lies, love all in one! Would recommend it to anyone.  Accents can be challenging to understand sometimes.

0061251321|5.0|This book was required reading for the Rich Dad Company, and we just finished a 3-day event with Robert Kiyosaki. It was powerful to delve into levels and observe where we are, how we live and perceive others and ourselves, and how to develop better teams, greater strength.

0618001905|3.0|Hard to comprehend, well written, but not really moving, complex subject probably requires extensive political history background. That is all I have for now.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|TinTin is a solid movie that is good for most children as it is not too scary.  The animation is terrific and shows what a talented team can put together.  Real actors need to watch out as CGI is now almost as good as the real thing and becoming cheaper to use in films than actors/actresses who command 10s of millions of dollars per film.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|I have yet to find a Buble album that I just love. Maybe it's the choice of orchestration? Sort of bland. And the music rarely rises above what I hear at the downtown music venues. Maybe it's just that I want something hotter, but I never go looking through the CD stack saying, gotta find that hot Buble album... He does have a reliable, attractive male voice and this CD is good on the stereo while entertaining guests.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I use the game while I am waiting:  Dr's. office, at the airport and when waiting for someone at the airport.  It is good for the mind - strategy.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Such a good book, well written I think is the best of the series, you can't put it down, once you start you need to end it
0307352145|4.0|I think I am an introvert .This book is about the power of introverts - so , of course I enjoyed it .  Thought provoking , perhaps a shade too long . I gave a copy to a friend ( an introvert I think ) who was not as knocked out as I had been , but I have still recommended it to others , and will continue to do so .better than your run of the mill self help stuff - more considered - as you'd expect !
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I first saw The Phantom years ago and it was great.  But this production made me cry of joy.  The music and the voices are SPECTACULAR!!  EVERYTHING IS SUPERB!  Everyone was WONDERFUL.  Andrew Lloyd Weber must be incredibly proud.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Such a shame that this show didn't go into another season. Great combination of comedy and drama, kinda like real life. Great characters great stories, easy to see why it's become a cult classic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The show is an engaging, well-acted soap opera. Adding considerably to the interest is the fact that it represents upper- and working-class British society becoming modernized and less social-class bound in the period just before and then after World War I
B001EOQWF8|5.0|So cute
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|This was pretty stupid and i played it once and deleted it off my Kindle. waste of money to buy
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|When I saw this game was free, I decided to go ahead and try it out. Why not? Once I played, I was shocked that I paid no money for this. Very fun game with challenges to keep you playing for a long time. I love Iron Man. If you do too, get this game!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining. I play it when I want to relax or just pass the time. enjoyable
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and if you  are thinking of downloading it you should there will be no doubt left in your mind after you play the  game.  I WOULD GIVE IT 100 STARS IF I COULD!  #awesomeness
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|The acting was great, I really got pulled into the story. At times it got very slow, not enough to stop watching. Matthew McConaughey was very impressive, he really can play any character and give it substance. Loved the two boys, there is our future movie stars.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love playing this game, my only problem is that it will not start on my kindle. I have to play on my iphone
B0087IT8FK|5.0|a beautiful story that adds just the right touch of laughter, thought and sadness.  add a wide range of music and it adds up to a wonderful movie.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Good mix of drama & comedy, well-scripted plots, and talented acting.  I enjoyed how the characters developed over season 1 and appreciated that the show, while not squeaky clean, does not rely on excessive sexual innuendo or gratuitous violence or gore to keep your attention.  I also appreciate that the characters seem to exhibit at least a modicum of concern for integrity (while the main character's role is based on a lie that he continues to perpetuate, at least he seems to be wrestling with that).
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|So... LOTS and lots of people are infuriated by this and the 2009 Star Trek movies. I have no idea why. I have no idea what they were expecting from a modernized reboot of the classic TV series. People are calling it boring, sad, hopeless, sappy, confusing, tiresome, shameful etc. etc.<br /><br />Have they seen the original series?!?! If so, go back and watch them season by season, episode by episode, and you will see nothing but boring, sad, hopeless, sappy, confusing, and tiresome! The original series was great, don't get me wrong, however time has not been kind to the classic ST series. Gaudy makeup, horrendous costumes and set designs, awkward dated dialogue, poor plots, etc.<br /><br />I for one am blown away by JJ Abrams' AMAZING Star Trek movies. Not just at the modern take on the classic, but on the OBVIOUS attention to detail in casting and set design, etc. This series WILL hold up over time. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but calm the heck down! It's just a movie!<br /><br />And to those who say \\"I cant get over all the plot holes\\"... It's an action sci-fi movie, just go with it, be entertained by it, and GET OVER IT. There are FAR worse movies out there including and not limited to Transformers, GI Joe, Avatar, the list goes on. THESE movies are made for young kids who don't care about quality.<br /><br />There are things I would have liked JJ to do (and not do) in this film, however HE is the artist. He wrote produced and directed this film and it would be extremely narcissistic of me or anyone else to discredit, scoff, scold, or shun his efforts and/or his work of art. I highly doubt anyone giving this film 1-3 stars and talking badly about this film would do it 1/12th as good.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Loved the honest portrayal and insights into the personality, values and mission of jobs.<br />You don't need an interest in computing to enjoy it.<br />Five stars - well written, thorough, important and relevant.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Well written humorous, dramatic..insightful. Always enjoy real life stories. I liked the historical references from past players and ball teams
B0019LY5IM|4.0|I am a huge J.J. Abrams fan.  It took me a couple of years but I now have the last 2 seasons. Not as good as the first four, but had to get the last 2 to complete my collection.
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|I love the acting this this movie. Sandra Bullock and Keannu Reaves are magnificent. I love romance movies, especially when the actors play their parts really well.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I am a huge J.J. Abrams fan.  It took me a couple of years but I now have the last 2 seasons. Not as good as the first four, but had to get the last 2 to complete my collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game my cousin had it on his nexus and he let me have a go and i loved it. I also recomend temple run.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Enjoyed it great beginning to the series with some nice twists<br /><br />Looking forward to the next book with have and Cleary
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Very educational for the kids. Classic. Very moving. We need more films like this one.  Will watch this one again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is extremely fun and addictive. I play any chance I can. Although I do wish some things didn't cost so much.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I really like the pulse. i Looked into quite a few different health tracking devices. I like the pulse because its small and you can fit it into any form factor you like. be it the watch or clip or whatever.<br /><br />Overall though its awesome, accurate, displays good info. Syncs easily. and has a good battery life.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I'm a little over halfway through and want to hand it over to my boys to read because I know they'll get a kick out of it, too.  Scalzi's name should be up there with all the other Sci-Fi greats!
B007V4LBLU|2.0|A story of addiction. If you are really fascinated by that, fine, but personally I didn't find it that compelling.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This book helps a lot to overcome your fears of talking to others. If you are feeling nervous about talking to someone, you should read this book. :)
B004X2M3N8|4.0|Matt Smith's doctor is a departure from what the show has been. I'd recommend first time watchers start in season 1 of the rebooted series with Christopher Eccleston
B0047SKR54|5.0|I'm loving the movie still haven't finished it yet but overall it's great. The best part was when they are clearly put the beach and they play that song really loud in their helicopters which really gets you pumped
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Since the tiles are reshuffled and unlimited number of times, you are guaranteed a win every time. So the only challenge is against the clock. I don't like this version as much as others because I don't need to plan three moves ahead or really decide which tile to remove before another. To me that is the true challenge of the game.
B000ZINGIK|4.0|Vocal skills out of this world!<br />Great musical compositions<br />True musicians and awesome story lines<br />Avantasia should be recognized for bringing great voices together
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|i admit i usetorrents, but buy what i love.<br />I'VE BEENA  FAN OF THIS BAND SINCE THE BEGINING.<br /><br />i waited for the cd it says it's delivered but ....nothing???????????????
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Not a bad game, fun to play every now and then.  The game is obviously geared for the younger players.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I wouldn't say M. McConaughey is amazing in it. He's himself, just dirtier (i.e. Mud).<br /><br />I don't understand the amazing reviews. It's entertaining, but it's not amazing or oscar worthy or anything like that. Compared to all the movies out there this summer, this would be the one worth watching. Though Hollywood movies are just awful nowadays. I guess that's why this one got such rave reviews.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Really fun and thought provoking game BUT, having to &#34;buy&#34; coins as the puzzles get tougher feels like an Amazon &#34;money-grab&#34; though!
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|I bought this doll for just over retail-$25-and it was so worth it. Twyla is one of my favorite dolls so far. She is the daughter of the Boogeyman and Howleen's  BFF, so she is her age and size. She wears a purple shirt with elbow-length sleeves, vertical stripes that have spiders and dots, a black collar, and black ribbon tied at the bottom of the collar. Her skirt has alternating ruffles of purple fish-net and black with mint swirls. Twyla's accessories include silver doorknob earrings (she does go into normie kids' rooms to eat their nightmares), mint belt with spider design, three bangles (one black and two purple), and a mint bracelet with a dream-catcher skull and spiders hanging off of it. Her shoes are purple, almost sneakers, with mint laces and spiders hanging off of them, and black swirls for heels. The only strange thing about the clothes is that the skirt is sewn so that if you lift the ruffles, they are only held together with purple fish-net.<br /><br />Her pet, Dustin, a dust bunny, is purple with a button eye. He is the cutest thing ever and he has a startled expression, making him even cuter. Twyla also comes with a purple purse with another skull-shaped dream-catcher on the front. Like all of the 13 wishes dolls, Twyla includes a diary, which is hilarious and shows some of her uniqueness (ex. favorite color=blurple, a mix of blue and purple, she's afraid of vacuum cleaners, etc.).<br /><br />This doll has several special features which make it worth the extra money. Her eyes glow in the dark, she has swirls painted on her legs in gray, and her hands/lower arms are gray as well. Her hair did shed a bit when it came out of the box, so I try not to brush it that much. She is also very detailed everywhere, my favorite thing about her, and if you look at the purse, you'll see a design in the background. Even the box is so pretty, I considered for a moment getting another one to keep it in the box.<br /><br />I gave this doll 5 stars in \\"Educational\\" because this line of dolls really teaches you that it's okay to stand out and be different, or as the Monster High motto says, \\"Be yourself, be unique, be a monster.\\" The only confusing thing was that on the box, it says a different age than her diary does. I think it's just a typo, though.<br /><br />This doll is one of the most original and unique ones, without a doubt, and it's a must-have for everyone. She has that aspect of a boogeyman with all of her accessories (ex. spiderweb dream-catchers, a dust bunny as a pet, doorknob earrings, etc.). Just a note about the seller, though: If you buy from Toy Crazes, the estimated arrival date is much later than the product  actually comes. My doll came in about 1.5 weeks, and it was not scheduled to come until 7/24. (I ordered it on 6/26.) As usual, look at stores and do not pay high prices, as I have seen this doll everywhere at Target. I can see more 13 wishes dolls in my future, naturally, as these are the new hot dolls, and they are so amazing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I enjoy this version of quell more than &#34;Quell Reflect&#34;.  They are both fun to play though. I would recommend though.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|I hadn't read Vonnegut in years and saw this for a bargain. I'll spare any reviews, the copy is good, no erors, classic Vonnegut.
0316201545|5.0|I'm in my twenties and thoroughly enjoyed and found great delight in reading Colfer's Land of Stories series. It's safe for kids, but it's a great read for all ages -- a creative and fresh take on classic fairy tales clashing with modern times.<br /><br />I'm amazed as I go further along into this series to see the author's imaginative twists and turns on the characters I'm already familiar with, know, and love. You'll love reading it to your kids as much as they'll love hearing it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Thus a game is amazing! I love it!!!! If you like despicable me and you saw 1 and 2 then you have to download this right now!!!!!!!!;-)
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The Hunger Games is a completely acceptable movie for teenagers, although it's not a very good movie. Jennifer Lawrence is very good. Unfortunately, the youngster, Liam Hemsworth, chosen as her partner is a horrible actor.  He is inexpressive and completely unconvinced as someone who is in danger of dying at any minute. The movie is far too long for no good reason. There are too many instances on which to watch it becomes chore. It could have been a much better movie with a duration of 90 minutes instead of  143 minutes.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Very interesting book!<br />Mr Kiyosaki probably is not the owner of all truth but he has a very interesting points of view.<br />Really good book!
1400067820|5.0|This book will change your life forever.  HIs prinicples have me questioning everything from relationships with other people. to work, to finances, to fitness and health.  Helps me recognize fragile situations and to able to better assess risks.  Will read this one over and over.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Can you watch this 3 disk version on a regular dvd? or is it just blueray? I'm a little confused! lol :)
B00BWWS81S|5.0|Always enjoy the work of KT Tunstall and she put her heart and soul into this CD. Love each and every track.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it!  Better than any modern day soap!  Picture is wonderful, sound is great.  My favorite show out there!<br />Highly recommend.
0399255370|5.0|My two year old loves this book which is not to say that it is simple but more that he likes it now and i expect him to enjoy it more and more and in new ways as he grows). It is a good long read but the letters along with the wonderful illustrations hold his interest perfectly. He wants to know why the crayons have grievances and how to fix them. He thinks the nude peach crayon is especially funny and speaks of him often. In any event, it is wonderfully entertains and each crayon has a message that it tied into the ending well done!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. It is very challenging, makes you think and really use your brain to figure out all the puzzle rooms.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Piece of S***!  Makes a distinct \\"whining\\" sound on full volume. Could not hear music over motorcycle.  Definitely do not buy.
B009P1WES6|4.0|The first half  of this book is brilliant and frightening. It is truly unique and pushes the concept of a crime novel.<br /><br />Characters are well drawn and have depth.  The second half is good but falls into more conventional territory and some implausibility creeps in.<br /><br />Overall an excellent novel and well worth a read to get a French perspective of noir. A refreshing change.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone. The animation is so good and it is just a fun movie to watch. Nothing like the classic version but still good.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Great behind the scenes of a Broadway show songs are well written. Always been a McPhee fan since American idol and she shines here.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This movie is a classic and was worth every penny! I was so happy to find this movie for such a good price.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Poignant, beautiful story that gripped me from the first page! Would recommend this book highly to anyone loving a good read.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This film provided an excellent plot for families, it hit home with fathers, mothers, and children all at the same time.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I am sixteen years old. I am currently a sophomore in high school. I have about three friends. And I suffer from extreme anxiety and depression.<br /><br />Charlie Kalmeckis is everything I could ask for to portray a teenager like me. He's quiet, witty, sweet, and real. He's a true wallflower. Logan was the best choice to play Charlie. He captured everything that Charlie was. A young man growing up too fast, with real mental disorders. Charlie was depicted in this film perfectly.<br /><br />My best friend reminds me of Patrick in every way possible. Ezra Miller plays Patrick the way he's meant to be. Upbeat, loud, flamboyant, and overall, loving, with a dark, sad twist. The acting and the writing for Patrick's character is impeccable. The way he goes from 100 miles an hour to nothing is very familiar to me, best seen in the person I spend my time with.<br /><br />Sam... she reminds me of my other best friend. Emma Watson is stunning in this film, from the first line she lets out of her mouth (\\"Question: could the bathrooms here be any more disgusting?\\"), and even when she's breaking my heart for Charlie (\\"What the hell is wrong with you?\\"). She's a true goddess in her role. She brings on Sam's skin like it's her own, her music taste is impeccable, and her fierce love of Charlie is perfectly portrayed.<br /><br />The cinematography for this film is beautiful. Absolutely breathtaking. I especially love the scene after Sam leaves and Charlie is headed home. Everything about it is wonderful.<br /><br />I also appreciate the gay culture in this, as a lesbian. It's hard, but it gets better!<br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say it... I relate to this film and the book better than anything, ever. And I loved every single moment of it. It's beautifully executed, with just the right amount of comedy and the edge of darkness. It's a coming of age story like never before. It will be cherished by millions for years to come. Thank you for making me see that there's a light at the end of the tunnel... and hopefully David Bowie will be playing while I fly through it.

B002NNA9N0|5.0|Old favorite of mine.  I  just downloaded for a quick plane flight.  I rented it and used Amazon Unboxed to download and watch it off-line.  This is a great system to watch a rented movie if you know you won't have internet access.  Even flights that have internet access sometimes block video due to bandwidth constraints.
B0016K40KY|5.0|A classic, wonderful scenes, exceptional cast. Peter O'Toole at his finest! A fine movie to see if you are a WW1 buff, even with the hyperbole.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This was for our granddaughter for her 4th birthday and she was so excited to get it.  It got to me very quickly and I was able to get it shipped to her in time for her birthday.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The Good Wife is an awesome show..  it peaks in this season. There's something fun, interesting, and/or tantalizing in each episode. Great cast, characters, and guest stars.
B008133MDK|5.0|Loved the show, season 3 is scheduled for October 31, 2013 can't wait. Good acting, if you like this show you should also like Elementary.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game keeps pushing you to think outside of the box, it incorporated jigsaw puzzles, math problems and test of memory in order to find the keys to escape from the room. Highly recommend this game.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is a great series, can't believe each episode is an hr and a half, its like watching a movie each time.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I waited to watch this movie until I had seen it on stage this summer (having never seen Les Mis before), and I was not disappointed!  Not only was the storyline dead on to the stage performance I saw, I was absolutely enthralled with the performances by Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried.  Everyone was fabulous, but knowing that singing is not the norm for these actors, I was just blown away!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Can't stop playing this game. It's fun and always challenging. There are also other games from the same company. Enjoy.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|If you liked Twilight, you need to get this one.  You have to see this one before you see anymore in the series and it is worth it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had no expectations about the book. It was on one of the Amazon Kindle lists. Once I started reading. I could not put it down. In short, it is about the lives of teenagers who are living with various stages of cancer. They want to live and die on their terms.  They do so with courage, humor, and all the snarkiness of teenagers. A good read.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Love the cast and the plot.  Hated to see Dolph Lundgren play a bad guy, but things did get better. Surprising twists!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A fantastic story. Throughout the years you're taken back to see who is in the story and why, plus the relationships to one another. Story writing at it's best!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is an exquisite compilation of music, written and performed by an extraordinary talent. If you really want to enjoy it at its best, play it on a rainy evening and sink into it.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I read this before I read A Walk Across the Sun and it was excellent. I would recommend it to any woman. It has a great deal of information on the cast system in India.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game:-)  I hope there will be a sequel! I also wish it had been a little longer it was hard to put down.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is one of my now favorites. Same time period as Mudbound, but a world of difference. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I enjoy the authors' attention to historical detail when she writes.  This period of English history was not as familiar to me as her series on the Tudors.  Not all Kings and Queens had a wonderful life and Ms Gregory tries to stay real to the situation.  I would recommend this book and the others in the Cousins' War to anyone who wants to read historical fiction within a readable story with characters that come to life on the page.  I have read all of her books and not been disappointed by any of them.
B007V4530A|5.0|great reference for those doing compelling presentations!!<br />It ha changed the way I do presentations....<br /><br />This book has inspired to bigger and better things!!
B0060AY85C|5.0|I LIKED THIS BOOK BY TONI BETTER THAN A MERCY IT HELD MY INTEREST BETTER AND THE CHARACTERS WERE MORE TO HER STYLE OF WRITING
0345495004|5.0|There have been some very harsh criticisms of the book, the story and the people involved. Before reading this book I knew only superficial details of Wright's life and his affair with Mamah. Because I knew it to be a fictional account of their story I read it with that in mind.<br /><br />The story told in this book is sad beyond words, in so many ways. Not the least of which is the unbelievably rigid system of morals in which women of that era had to exist. One false move and you were ruined. Men of course, did not suffer in the same way. Mamah made the unthinkable error of falling in love. Yes, she fell in love with a man who many feel was a \\"super ego\\" with little or no feeling for others. But, we cannot know what went on between them; even those who lived then and knew them, didn't know what the inner workings of their relationship was actually like. The man had several strikes against him from the beginning due to the unhealthy relationship with his overbearing mother.<br /><br />I found the portrayal of Mamah to be somehow encouraging. Maybe not every woman in those times was willing to simply cower and let a man dictate every aspect of her life. Maybe some women understood that there is/can be more to life than just bearing babies, doing laundry and wiping noses and counters. I found it very, very interesting. Other reading I have done about life for women in that era leads me to believe that the author's depiction is accurate, and perhaps (with the amount of research she did)Mamah was very much as she was portrayed. Intelligent, passionate and flawed.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|This is the first album I've purchased by MGMT and I totally love it.  It's groovy, funky, energetic and I can't help but dance even when I'm driving.  I get so engaged in the music that when it's over I'm disappointed the albums not longer.  The lyrics are great too.  It's not for everyone, my office mate hates it, but I highly recommend it.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|The easy operation allows one to easily move to and from any desired place in the bible. Makes it a pleasure to attend and stay up with my Bible Study group. Also the easy access to a reference on the subject being discussed.. Excellent visual presentation can be adjusted for one's desired setting. A must have for any bible reader.
B003Y2BMVC|5.0|I've been looking for this movie everywhere. It's been so long since I've seen it. Now I can share it with my grandchildren. What a great disney pleasure full of adventure, a little worry and great ending. I do love a good family movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My title isn't about Gus and hazel. Its about how I'm just in love with John green right now. This is by far my favorite book. EVER!!!!  After reading the sample, I knew I would love it,  And I am not ashamed that I bought this book without my mom's permission. Though I know I should be I just can't bring myself to be. I was crying my butt off a lot and I sort of hated the book for being so sad. But that was also why I loved it. Quoting the book \\" without pain you will not now joy.\\" At least something along those lines. I also loved the complexity of the book. I constantly had to highlight words for the definitions and then I still had to figure the sentence out. I didn't hate that though, I loved that. I believe only the really good books make you have a headache and get your brain moving. Like hazel, I wish I could meet John, but the world is not a wish granting factory.  By the way, if you believe it, i m actually just thirteen like five days ago. Sometime I feel like I'm thirteen going on thirty. Thanks John for expanding my vocabulary.  Morgan wilsdon
B004YW4L5K|5.0|A friend told me about this book, and I looked at its length and tried to remember the last time my busy workload left me time to read a book so long. Still, I was intrigued, and my friend has good taste, so I bought it, and flew through it in a few weeks. When it was over I wished there were more...so I bought another of his books instead.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I wish it sent out alerts for severe storms. That would be very helpful where I live, in tornado alley.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Excellent history lesson! Never knew so much about the corruption of communism and the fall of the German empire. Lets not let it happen here
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|I liked the movie because it was funny, it had a good storyline, and good actors! Four more words blahh
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I have not spent a dime on this game and enjoy challenging my patience.  If you have children playing this game encourage them not to open the treasure chests for 6 pearls. They will be dissappointed and cry when they get almost nothing for what takes a few days to earn. Its cute though to set up your own reef and visit others. I'd say this game is more fun for adults who know a money ploy when they see one.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I rate TV programs - especially series - with the writers about equal to the actors.  I think the writers have done an excellent job each year.  The parts are all very well cast.  Good acting with good scripts equals good entertainment.  I am re-watching every episode of each year.
B006ZB664W|4.0|was new to the merrell barefoot shoe line and this was the first shoe i bought.  it's a good shoe.  very durable.  feels like i have a lot of support and it looks great.  it does eat into the back of my heel though, which is annoying, but fits nice and snug otherwise.  ill figure something out.  if it wasn't for that, i would have given it 5 stars.  good shoe though
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Since Adobe flash stopped supporting android devices(so I've heard) this is the only way i can watch my YouTube videos quick and easily on my kindle fire hd. And it seems the creaters of this app have gotten rid of the porn ads, cuz i haven't noticed any, but then again i usually watch my videos on full screen and the ads go away. I do have a suggestion though. When i go back to my list of videos, have it to where i last was on the list instead of the top of it some times i have to back track a long way
B0064MGU98|5.0|More than I expected it to be!  Can't wait for season 4 to be available on instant video - Cant wait!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Great chemistry between all of the characters and actors.  Best show I have watched in a long time.  Topics are unique at times and different from just the same o same. I love how the writers have gradually built the love relationship between Beckett and Castle.  I also love seeing the old and well known actors that come on the show to portray Castle's writing buddies or some of Beckett's partners.  Great writing team and excellent story lines.  Overall rating of 5 or if I could give it a 10 I would.  Keep up the great work.
B00AB7IA1S|2.0|No challenge and very little play value.  I discarded it very quickly.  Do not recommend this unless you use it to entertain a young child.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The basis for this book was really interesting, which is why I stuck with it and read the entire book.  But I wasn't a huge fan of the author's writing style, which is why I only gave it three stars.
B00DNO3HXC|5.0|Second time I watched this love story with a twisted end. I will watch it again.in the near future with friends.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Kids love it! Very cute movie. Funny, sweet and very special ending. My niece can't get enough of Matilda!! Highly recommend
B008Y76VW2|4.0|I enjoyed this movie about a small town carnival where every year the local teens spend their summer learning about life and love.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Anyone who would like to have a little challenge instead of the usual monotonous mindless games that seem to be greatly outnumbering the stimulating ones, then I highly recommend this game for anyone with a smart phone or tablet. A very well spent dollar indeed, I would have paid 3x the price for it, but thankfully it's only .99cents. Mad props to the developers, yo! LOL
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A wonderful story, period.  Think on what you have read in the last year or two. How many good stories have you been told?  This is a story you will want to carry about with you and share with friends. Quit dithering and read it.
006117758X|5.0|This is a sad story about a boy growing up in tough times with a strict father and how he learned to cope with life's issues.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a wonderful, well developed story. The author writes a story that is easy to read and hard to put down. I have read other novels by her, and have never been disappointed. I would recommend this book to anyone no matter what you normally may look for to read because I feel this story would satisfy lots of readers. Hers always has a bit of a mystery to it, and I enjoy the historical theme also.
1476734941|5.0|This is a method of taking off pounds without too much thought. Eat regular meals 5 days and (fast) eat light for 2 days. I find myself even eating less on my regular days. And those 2 fast days are not set. You can move them around to meet your schedule.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|These are to fun gifts for my adults kids for Christmas, so they haven't been played with, but they arrived in excellent condition and quickly.
0689835604|5.0|I love this book for my grand girl Kate.  This is a hard, flip cover book which is great for my one year old grand girl.
1401941893|3.0|This book is just okay, in my opinion. It wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish it, but it wasn't one that I read in one sitting. I had to make myself pick it up and keep pushing though it. I guess it's just, as many reviews have said, too light of a read. It is a very inspiring book, so if you need something to lift you up and make you smile, this would be a great book to pick up just for those reasons. Overall, it's a pretty good, easy read.
0375869026|5.0|What a great book to help kids see how we effect other people by what we do.  A great book to read aloud in my classroom.
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies just keeps getting better and better. This is only Season 1 and sets up the characters, the struggle, the enemy in an engaging, humanistic way. Excellent writing and  direction. Imaginative FX used in balance with the human equation of survivors striving to reclaim their invaded Earth. Good story, well acted. I was so happy to find all 3 complete seasons available on Amazon Prime video and re-watched Season 1 over the span of three nights. On to Season 2, then Season 3! I just wish there were more episodes per outing. Ten is certainly not enough per season. I do understand that Season 4 will have 12 episodes (still NOT ENOUGH)! Of course a summer replacement show will have less episodes than a fall-based series, and any show with this amount of FX costs lots of money. The fans want more -- regardless!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Living my teenage years in the 80's, I absolutely loved this book!  It covers the whole spectrum of the 80's while keying in on video games.  Makes me want to dig out my Atari 2600 and play a bit.  Well worth the money.  A great read.
0062255657|3.0|I liked this book, I did..I just felt like there were parts that weren't explained all that well. I didn't really understand who exactly the Hemstocks were or what there story was. I didn't really understand what these creatures were that were stocking the family..but although the story was short, I did enjoy it and read it rather quickly. I love Neil Gaiman, and I don't think I have read anything by him yet that I haven't liked. I will say that it's not one of my favorites but still a nice read.
0399159347|4.0|Although the initial chapters of The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty were a little irritating, off-putting, and confusing, the novel changed course and became a surprisingly good read with interesting characters and a substantial story. Endure the quirky beginning and the confusion of the initial character introductions, and you will find an engaging story that will keep you reading until the ultimate conclusion.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is that no matter how secure you are in your marriage and family, there are potential secrets lurking about, that once uncovered, can dramatically change the trajectory of your life. What would you do if you found a letter from your husband to be opened after his death, but your husband was still alive when the letter was found? Is the truth worth knowing if it shatters everything that you hold dear? Repercussions of finding out the truth can be devastating.<br /><br />There were three interconnected stories being told; Cecelia Fitzpatrick found a revealing letter left by her husband, John-Paul, and her \\"perfect\\" life was never the same after reading it. Likewise, revelations by Will and Felicity catapulted Tess to make changes and confront a very different truth from the one she thought she knew. Finally, Rachel Crowley, grief-stricken over the murder of her daughter, was so consumed with finding the truth that it skewered her perceptions and all aspects of her world. Ultimately, the truth will set you free, but not without cost.<br /><br />I thought the book was very well-done. I enjoy a quick read that is also thought-provoking. Without spoiling the story, my only wish was that the author handled the unexpected ending in a different way, one a little less disturbing. I love Epilogues, and this one was no exception.  Take a chance on this book. I think that you will be glad that you did.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Best book I have read. It speaks to your soul and leaves you wanting more, I recommend this to everyone.
B005FISBTO|4.0|Dexter is always amazing, saw the season already so it was not surprise when I watched the DVDs. Great price
0679805273|5.0|The book was it great shape. It was brand new and came in two days. There's really not much else to say. It's a book and the kids loved it for about a week. lol. another one in the collection shelf.
0439023521|5.0|Amazing book! Reading it as a write the review.<br />Can't wait to order the next books on the trilogy. You will get hooked!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was hard to put this book down.  I found myself reading a page or two while I was brushing my teeth or washing dishes.  That is crazy.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Great adventure with intriguing characters and plenty of humor. If you go for the big bang special effects, there' a lot of that to keep you entertained, too. For me, it's all about the acting. Helen Mirren is wonderful. Lots of fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series just gets better and better. I love everyone of the characters. Can 't wait for the next season of shows.
B005SAV9SO|5.0|One of my top ten &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; movies of the past decade. Not great acting, only an average plot. But you can't stop giggling. Best to enjoy with a bottle (or two) of wine.
B004YESKU0|5.0|its not all big its easy to take everwhere with you! I wish they had more music for this box set!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a great story, you wonder where it is all headed and then Grisham delivers a terrific ending that you never would have guessed.  A marvellous book.
B009O07NMA|5.0|This CD is rockin' full of great country tunes. These guys are ready to be the next award-winning Duo of the Year in Country Music!
B00992CF6W|5.0|For a Kindle game wow it's really good I have to us the rest of the words so I'm just saying stuff sorry but it's an awesome game get it if you don't.
B000W237RE|5.0|If you own only 1 Allman Brothers Album this should be the one.  I am OLD School Rocker and love the Jam's. More songs have been ruined by singing. This has just enough lyrics and great music.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|Some OK stuff, but nothing that he would have let be released if he was still alive.  Last tune pretty cool, but not long enough.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|Love this movie and all the actors. It just goes to show you how much we have in common with other people when we give them a chance and all the fun we could have. even love.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down once I started. The story was so real, that I felt as if I was living it. Truly touching.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I love Jack Nicholson, he is one of my favorite actors.  It had a very good story but I could do without all the crying when she was writing her play.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show. Interesting left me want to watch more... can't wait for the next season to be available.  In my opinion a definite must see.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|But they're so fun to watch. I hope they revive mathew. First they paralyze him but no he walks! and then they crash his car. Poor guy.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|Love David Baldacci.  I have read them all and I have to say that this one is one of my favorite.  He shows the softer side/human side of Will.  Would recommend any Baldacci books, but especially this one.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This app let's you tweak your music. You can give your music a bass boost. If you use it with head phones it sound so awesome!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book is so very awesome. I can not beloved  the end. It leaves you in such suspense and books like that are what people are looking for just like I was until finding this book
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game i do wish it had more features but oh well its a great game and fun to play on the go!!!
B0066W1AZK|1.0|no instructions so I can't figure out how. to move the pieces at all.  How is some one new to the game supposed too figure it out?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was looking for an app that had many Bible versions that I could reference while at my weekly bible study without having to bring a bagful of Bibles.  I really like the links that take me to website of the individual Bible where they have additional tools like Mathew Henry's commentary or an assortment of study notes.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I'm not a huge scy fy fan as far as my reading goes but husband recently suggested I read enders game and I was instantly hooked. I love every word of it. I would certainly suggest this book to friends.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I enjoy the gameplay. the fact u can get gems with out buying them if u want to take ur time
0739378392|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Every book I have read by Danielle Steel has a lot of twists and turns.  It is a love story that is worth reading.  I highly recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is so much fun to play. My son and I enjoyed playing this together.<br /><br />It really works your brain.
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|At first I really loved this app, because I have tons of downloaded music that I was finally able to organize. Unfortunately, as I was doing so, the app decided it didn't actually want to play my files, telling me that songs I'd just listened to weren't compatible. Every one of my files were corrupt and I had to delete them all. I don't know what kind of bug that may be, but I'm pretty upset that I lost all of my music. It's a great app, except it eats your files. I use a kindle so I don't know if that makes a difference, but be careful with this one.
B000F8O35U|2.0|It works fine but if I put it in a blue ray player then it has a few problems. It was used after all. If I put it in a regular DVD player it works fine.
0345529057|5.0|Bought books for a friend as a gift and each one was around ten bucks. Bought these for myself and saved over 20 dollars. Awesome deal.
B0081336FO|5.0|It was very good.  Even better than the first season. I cannot wait for season 3.  I can watch Benedict anytime.  He makes an awesome Sherlock.
0553801473|5.0|I love this book, I'm only on the 4th right now but this one is looming on my desk waiting and the hard cover is just beautiful.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Outstanding presentation of a classic series.  I'll share this and will also take a new look at it from time to time.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This was a tolerable movie.  Fight scenes and special effects were very well done but the story was forgettable. Too bad.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|I love this game on my Android phone, but there are glitches on the Kindle version that need to be fixed, it's a 5 star game when they do :)
B0068THAGY|5.0|Classic movie and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It had the storyline with the Kids trying to figure out what was going on like E.T., yet had all the suspense and surprises in a way that Close Encounters delivered.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|This is a fascinating series with superb acting! Having lived in Rome for decades, and being familiar with the Borgia Rooms at the Vatican, as well as the history of the family and times, this series brings it all together.
B00001OH7N|5.0|This remastered recording could not have been any better.  The CD was packaged perfectly and arrived as stated. I was very pleased by this purchase.<br />RDF
B0038AL7EW|5.0|This movie covers a topic few of us are comfortable discussing and turns it into something warm and beautiful.  A must-see.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This movie was a nice compilation of the earlier ones with good characters and plenty of action a good storyline.
B00DUGCLY4|2.0|At first I liked this, but after guessing quite a few right, when you get stumped, it will not let you past that one unless you purchase coins. I did not want to purchase coins. But, if i tried to go back into it, it always brings you back to the same word to try and figure out. therefore, i deleted this game from my Kindle.
B0000074FL|5.0|As a big Thin Lizzy fan I have worn out a few CD's and they need replacing. This, Thunder and Lightning and Live and Dangerous are on the need to be replaced list.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is a wonderful mixture of realism about mental illness and the stress of family life as father and son jockey to keep their various formulas for surviuval in some kind of harmony.  The acting is superb and the rendering of the hero's struggles touchingly realistic.  DeNiro is magiucal himself as the bookie father trying to get the Philadelphia Eagles to win through his obsessive rituals.  The romance that develops between the hero and an experienced young dancer, played with stunning skill by the stars, leads to a feel good ending that makes this a highly enjoyable film.,
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Awesome as always from Mr DeMille, exciting, informative, humorous and captivating. I am anxiously awaiting for follow-up.  Chet is late on his dues.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|If you cannot enjoy this film put together so splendidly by Dustin Hoffman you may not enjoy good cooking,m great books,<br />or spectacular mountain views.  This story, set in a retired musician's' home, is a natural delight to be savoured not for its depth of characterization as much as the joy of its creation.  The acting features knock out performances by Billy Connolly, Tom Courtenay, Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins, Michael Chambon, and perfectly arrayed cast of supporting players, is as deeply entertaining as its premise is humanly revealing.  If you cannot enjoy this sweet film, you deserve the noisy summer blockbusters playing nearby.  Dustin Hoffman, take a bow....
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I enjoyed this game but was shocked when the game ended.  There were a lot of intricacies involved and I liked the graphics.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This is a gripping and well made film in which even the minor cast members perform admirably.  The success of this movie about a pilot addicted to drink, drugs, and one night stands inbetween flights depends on the extraordinary performnce of Denzel Washington who was nominated for and should have won the Academy Award.  This is worth seeinbg just for the joy of seeing a great actor at work.  It is an excellent movie even fpr frequent fliers who might not enjoy the very realistic plane crash.  It is about how a man crashes and finds his way to redemption.  You will not see a better performance by any actor in any movie this year.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|ALL MOVIES ALL BLU-RAY SO EXCITED. My whole family loves these movies we are getting a blu-ray player for Christmas this will go great with it.
034580709X|4.0|I've read the other Harry Hole series and liked them very much. It's odd to read the first one last, (because I don't speak Norwegian) now that they've finally translated it.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|I got all 3 of them great movies for the whole family. I love will smith he is an awesome actor would buy anything with him in it
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Normally when you get this many starts together the movie suffers. Not in this case. I have seen this movie multiple times nd it never gets old. Very fun movie to watch.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie can't wait for the next one.  Got this for my daughter for Christmas she's 14 and loved the book
0060920084|3.0|This is Bryson's first travel book. He takes a road trip round a large number of Continental US states, visiting a lot of out of the way, less known places.<br /><br />It is a moderately entertaining book. The first sections have some very funny prose - such as his description of childhood trips to visitor attractions, excitement mounting to a frenzy as each sign marking down the distance appeared, only to discover a derelict shack in the final stages of solvency.<br /><br />There are plenty of descriptions of motels, junk food, bland landscapes, people with minimal levels of cultural sophistication and underwhelming travel experiences. The travelogue is funny at first, but becomes repetitive after a while. One senses that by the second part of the trip which takes in some of the Western states, Bryson had rather lost his verve for the trip.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can You Escape is great fun!  It is challenging with many unique problems to solve.  The rooms are full of intriguing puzzles.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I have used RepliGo since I had a Palm and it does what it says. Good customer service has been my experience.
0525478817|5.0|I have always wanted to read this book and I finally bought it. I have heard AMAZING reviews on this book and I can't wait to read it. It arrived REALLY quickly which is a wonderful thing. Can't wait to start!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Such a wonderful and classic love story which inadvertently brings a Fairytale hope of achieving great love and superior happiness.
B00119ZMKW|3.0|I am fast losing interest with their inability to let go of Anubis and the stupid replicators.  Where is the imagination they used to exhibit?  They even repeat alot of their lines from previous episodes.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I don't usually read books in the fantasy genre. This author is a great storyteller!  I really enjoyed this book.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This program is very relaxing.  After a long days work it gives me a chance to wind down.  Instead of coming up with the puzzle myself I can just make the finished product without stress.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Talk about twists and turns......I can usually pick up on the plot and know the end way before the last chapter.<br />The Racketeer kept me guessing until the last age.<br />Well done!
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|I LOVE my NEW Enter the Dragon 40th Anniversary Blu-ray dvd as well as the MARVELOUS MEMORABILIA that came along with it!!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I don't know how to recharge any of my electronics without the cord.That is a silly question, what would you advise?
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was a good novel it was beast  and I'd give it to any one<br />Who ever likes these kind of books. It also could be better if it was voice reader
B00D78J7SI|5.0|This album is as good as the last few. I have 6 total now. I was not disappointed. I am not one of those reviewers that compares to earlier albums and wonders if they are selling out or growing stale, etc. if bands keep putting out work consistent with what I liked from them before, I keep buying their albums. I am enjoying it.
B001I9B9I4|5.0|You may say you have seen it why bother?  Yes Chasing Liberty is one of my favs too, but this one is just darling and in many ways more realistic and funny in different ways.  It captures that rare and tender moment when parents send their dear child off from home to college, and it's all done in a fish bowl.  I love a good first love story and this is one.  Katie Holmes is just perfect for this role and Michael Keaton does a surprisingly good job at the Father who happens to be President.  It's not too long a movie and not overdone like so may these lighthearted ones are these days:)
B00E193TM2|5.0|This album is better than the last one. Rob Halford and the chick from In This Moment do great. I was not disappointed.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Passes time when I may be waiting at the Dr. office or wafting for other reasons  Buy it you will like it.
B0069JBKHI|2.0|It's a nifty monitor, and (at least with my iPhone), it works nicely -- most of the time.  I like the functionality it offers, but the stability is far from perfect.  It looses connection frequently and when their website goes down, it's difficult to connect at all.  Not cool when this happens in the middle of the night!  We are going to go buy a back up monitor tomorrow. :(  Cool toy, but not reliable enough to serve it's sole purpose. This was a gift, but I'm still disappointed someone had to shell out this much money for something that does not deliver.<br />Bottom line- if you want a cool and convenient way to monitor your baby with the device you already carry around with you- then this is it.  But if you want something you can trust will alert you when need be, I'd suggest getting something else (at least as a backup).
0679882820|4.0|The book is made of heavy pages and is a real plus for a small child to grasp and probably chew on.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I am always weary of apps like this but it was free so I gave it a try and it works .It frees up space and cleans up my tablet  caches and junk I don't even  realize is on my tablet. Recommended.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Just like the card game it's fun to play but you have to start adding real money far too quickly and often.  I hate 'free' games that aren't really free.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This DVD didn't come with any special features but the movie itself is worth buying for not only the plot but the actors. They are too pretty to say no to.
B005DJREJS|5.0|It really takes some of the best parts of 80s John Hughes movies, makes frequent high-end pop-culture references, and has smart engaging and fully-fleshed out characters.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|This DVD set is perfect. It has the christmas special and some other specials (besides River) that make this DVD set worth buying no matter the cost.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|I paired this CPU with a ASRock Socket FM2/AMD A55 FCH/DDR3/A&V&GbE/MicroATX Motherboard FM2, and I am impressed with the performance. I can play Unreal Tournament 3 just fine, wasn't expecting that.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I don't consider myself an avid reader but I hated to put this book down; and loved the second book, and am looking forward to the third.
B000FC130E|5.0|I have never visited London but if I ever do, I must be sure to see London  Below. Masterful tale of getting what you always thought you wanted, and then realizing it's not what you want at all. The characters are finely tuned and carry the story with great emotion and purpose. I was enthralled<br /> from the beginning all the way to the labyrinth end.  Loved it completely!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun problem solving game that I would highly recommend. With that said, it only has 10 levels. I would love to see more levels added. If you enjoy puzzle solving games I think this is a good one to get for free. The adds are not distracting. They are small &amp; located at the bottom of the screen. If I had paid for this game I would have been disappointed by the brevity of it.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I do not know if I can add anything about this show that someone else has not already written.  This show is fabulous and we enjoy it.  We do like watching it on the DVD's so there are no commercial interruptions and can watch the episodes back to back or go back if miss something.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King has the best characters he always has. I love all of King's book and this one is no different.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I highly recommend watching this series, but you may get hooked and then you will be waiting for the final season to be released like we are in my house. We enjoy watching this series on DVD as we do not like watching this show with interruptions and also like watching it in blocks of episodes back to back so recommend buying the seasons.
0515153656|5.0|Jack Reacher is an amazing character. He really knows how to handle every situation. I can't wait to read the rest of this series.
0812932293|3.0|He's a very smart man and a great business man also.  Not an educational book, but a good read.  Have to enjoy business
0553593544|4.0|This book is a great. It is an incredible story that provides a lot of intrigue. I can't wait to catch up on the rest.
B000C13Y2S|5.0|Great little keychain.  Emits good light.  My wife ended up taking it and keeping it in her purse.  High quality Stanley product.
0515142247|5.0|Jack has an impressive skill set that he obviously doesn't mind showing off. I can't wait to read the rest of this series.
0802473156|5.0|This book is great for couples looking to help their marriages.<br />Especially if they don't understand what the problems are.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|After reading the Wallender series by Henning Mankell, I was hungry for more Scandinavian mysteries. Jo Nesbo delivered! I am now hooked on the Harry Hole series. I started with The Snowman and simply couldn't put the book down. This is a story that will shock you, scare you, and keep you guessing until the final pages. I've grown to love the complexity of Harry Hole who struggles with alcoholism, people in his department who would love to get rid of him, and a difficult love relationship. He and Rakel, the love of his life, seem doomed to be star-crossed lovers. After reading The Snowman, I ordered The Bat, the first book in the series, and quickly ordered most of the other books. My husband says the books must be good because he hasn;t seen my face in a week. Anyone who likes the Steig Larssen books(The Girl Who.....) or the Wallender series will enjoy Harry Hole.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|So glad this was a \\"short novel\\", as this book did not do it for me. I look over all the 5*, 4* and 3* and thought, \\"What did I miss?\\".  I wonder if you did not know the author and love him, would you still rate this so highly?  When you read reviews of people you respect that loved it, such disappointment, and you question yourself.  I trudged painfully through this short novel, missing what others loved, looking for it along the way.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|PROFESSIONALY DONE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM- solid story lines and good entertainment beats a &#34;reality program&#34;hands down--Brits do this stuff better
B0089LOG02|5.0|I have a friend who was actually an orphan and on an orphan train, so this book is meaningful to me. I think the writing and the content is very good.
B00BESM14U|4.0|good movie... definitely something to watch when you got nothing else to watch lol loved the twists in the movie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun. Not too hard, but challenging. Ten levels go by quickly and now I have to wait for more rooms to explore.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Anything with Will F. is a must watch! Hillarious movie , my kids love it! perfect for the holidays. Must see
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  I grew up in the 50's so I knew of some of these issues, but not all.  Great film.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like running but wat I love the most is laughing at the minions. their hilarious but u gotta see how they make my sis laugh....:3 :) :D
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Honestly, I don't remember much of this film because I was busy doing something, but I do remember not hating it and I do remember thinking that the guy from Dazed and Confused was doing a good job acting.<br /><br />So, while I am no Leonard Maltin, it will get 3 stars because a girl picked it out and I didn't hate it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is great for people who've gotten spacial thinking type minds, it gives them a method of using their brains and deep thinking abilities
B00AGH6FD8|4.0|Not sure why, but I wanted to see both Home Alone movies again recently. (yes I know there was a third, but that one doesn't count)<br /><br />Anyway, Since I am no longer a child, I can honestly say that Home Alone 1 stands the test of time, but Home Alone Two was kind of like watching the Hangover Two, it is kind of the same movie just in a different setting.<br /><br />Not sure how you cannot recommend this movie, but if you have a 5 year old, it might fine to put both movies on, but if you are an adult wanting to relive some movies of your youth, then you should skip this one.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits is such a great, smart, well written show with a brilliant cast.  Gabriel Macht is amazing as Harvey Specter. Its interesting to see how things develop between him and Mike.  Donna is so much fun.  And then there is Lewis.  I usually feel at least two emotions a show where he is concerned.  Love him. Hate him. Feel bad for him. Laugh.  Jessica is very smart and one of the most elegant characters on tv.  Overall..AWESOME
B00B7Y0206|1.0|F this app it almost destroyed my kindle fire it works but then all of a sudden bam it happened I don't know if it was my kindle or the app but just don't get this app.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Ordered the whole cd as it was an awesome deal on amazon mps.  The whole cd is great!!!  Love every song!
B008I43DYU|1.0|could never find it on my Kindle.  It disappeared into never never land and will probably never be seen again
1416955070|5.0|As the release of the movie approaches I decided to push this book to the top of my TBR pile. This poor book had been pushed down further and further into my stack of books and then I heard that the movie was being made. Still it sat until I heard about the movie being released. Once I started reading I immediately wanted to kick myself for having put it off for so long. It took a couple of pages into it, but then it took off and didn't slow down until the end.  Once Valentine made an appearance I had already predicted where the story would go and I was upset when it went there, but all in all I'm confident that something good is around the corner with that situation. What's not to love Werewolves, Vampires, Fairies and many other creatures. Danger, excitement, and betrayal too!<br /><br />I found myself laughing out loud over many of Clary & Jace's conversations. The relationship between Simon & Clary has it's moments of laughable topics as well. However I don't care for Isabelle's 180 flip and Alec doesn't seem like an important character yet. I don't know if he becomes important, but so far I haven't seen any use for him.<br /><br />Overall I am impressed with the book. The imagery is fantastic, and most of the characters are pretty well rounded. The story is progressive and highly entertaining, and full of substance, so it rates 5 Stars.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman has always been one of those authors that I feel like I should be a huge fan of, but I'm just not. Although \\"Good Omens,\\" which he wrote with Terry Pratchett, is one of my favorite books of all time, I've tried to read \\"American Gods,\\" \\"Neverwhere,\\" and even his comic book series \\"Sandman,\\" none of which grabbed me in a way that demanded I keep reading (although I'm still holding out hope for \\"American Gods\\": I'm a firm believer that certain books have to be read at certain times, and \\"AG\\"'s time just hasn't come 'round yet). I digress. The book at hand is his slim, powerful coming-of-age novel \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane.\\" All I have to say is...damn.<br /><br />The story plays out almost like a Grimm's fairy tale, with a 1970s Sussex, England setting. The unnamed narrator is a middle-aged man returns to his rural childhood home for a funeral and begins reminiscing about the summer of his seventh year, the summer of Lettie Hempstock, her mother, and her grandmother (Mrs. Hempstock and Old Mrs. Hempstock, respectively). The Hempstock ladies are new to the area (or are they?), and when a drifter kills himself on the Narrator's land, the Narrator is befriended by the eleven year old Lettie, who takes him under her wing and displays an even greater interest in his well-being than his own parents and younger sister. The more the Narrator finds about Lettie and her family, however, the more he realizes that there is something...special about them. Something magical. Lettie and the Narrator's friendship unwittingly sets off a chain of supernatural events culminating in the appearance of the sinister Ursula Monkton, a Mary Poppins-from-Hell with a vengeance-jones for Lettie. Ursula is hired by the Narrator's parents as a nanny, and begins a reign of terror that only Lettie can save him from.<br /><br />This book is short at only 178 pages, but Gaiman packs more action, emotion, and suspense in these less-than-200 pages than many writers can pack into a novel twice this length. Lettie Hempstock is one of the strongest, kindest, most enigmatic heroines to come along in a long time, and her innocent yet powerful love for the Narrator is very real and heartbreaking. Their relationship is the heart and soul of this book, providing the story with both humor and heartbreak. Ursula Monkton is by far one of the most deliciously evil villains from any book this summer; while I didn't find her quite as scary or entertaining as Charlie Manx from Joe Hill's \\"NOS4A2,\\" her malevolent omniscience and manipulation of the Narrator's entire family--specifically his father and sister--was extremely ominous and does for nannies what \\"Jaws\\" did for the great white shark.<br /><br />\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" broke the Gaiman Curse for me. I finally get what all of the fuss is about. This is one of those books that really encourages you to think back to your childhood, and all of the terror, wonder, and nostalgia that entails. Most of all, it affirms the idea that friendship is one of the most powerful forms of love, and that friends like Lettie Hempstock must be treasured for the effect which they have had (or continue to have) on our present day selves. This book is a hair-raiser and a heartbreaker, and is more than worth your time and money.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Awesome history about many amazing artists. I must have a good ear for quality music because alot of my most listened to artists were recorded using the Neve Console.
B0087ZG7PW|1.0|It didn't work and needs to be replaced.  Do I return it or do you just send another one? broken
B00DQBWLSO|1.0|I pre-ordered this CD without listening to any samples from it. I did that based on John Mayer's past albums. What a disappointment. I would not recommend this CD. Unsure what type music this is.  I do recommend you listen to music samples and make your own mind up.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have played many games similar and non can compare to the AMAZING, intriguing awesomeness of this one.  Please continue to make more games like it!  I never had any trouble and loved how it helps me to clear my mind and allow it to figure the clues.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Just a fun and entertaining game for my Kindle fire HD. Good graphics and is a all around good game
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I've been wanting this movie for a long time. The price was perfect, and I got it so fast!  Thank you.
B00004YX39|5.0|I have purchased this album several times (2 vinyls, 1 cassette, and now the 3rd CD).  They keep disappearing from my collection.  Damn those kids and relatives.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My wife got this game for her little sister but she plays it too they have enjoyed it and played on and off through the weekend
B000068FXR|5.0|It came in great shape and early. This CD is helping me round out my collection. This is a fun album
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|My wife loves to read and play games this is one of the games she chose she plays 3 or 4 times a day on her kindle with amazon Prime.  She has shown me how this game interacts with other players and this is her favorite game
B000JLQSW4|5.0|Had extra songs on CD than original album. It has been a long time since I heard any of these songs, but I still remember them all.
B00C1040TO|5.0|I teach begining band and this is wonderful tool because it is easy ro use. I would recommend it to other school music teachers.
1572814349|5.0|I bought these for myself and this time, I bought some for my roommate, They are beautiful and the cards are thick and the pictures are exquisite. I absolutely love this deck. So beautiful and well-made.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The author seems to have written Book Three with her eyes closed and with handcuffs on, and not in a good way. The writing is just as ham-fisted as the first two installments, but at least they were steamy and fun. Maybe the novelty has just worn off! I'd love to see a sequel 20 years later, when the protagonists are trying to deal with teenagers and a large, smelly dog.
B0087EACJK|4.0|This will make you think to the point where it gets maddening to get everything before leaving the door.  Part of me, I am not that desperate but this is a very good game nonetheless.  Good puzzle game where you need to think in different directions, but also like chess where you need to think ahead as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is well written. The author writes good stories with nice layers and interesting characters. You care what happens to the people in this novel. The only bad part about this book is that the cover has these two actors on it and will make you think about seeing the movie. Like most books made into movies, the movie performs subpar but this movie really blowed. No chemistry for the pair, unlike in the book. I enjoyed the book and if you’ve ever seen the movie “Sleeping with the Enemy” this books mirrors it closely. I also remember reading A Walk to Remember and The Notebook by N. Sparks and he is a good writer.
B0096DZKZC|4.0|Of course, I bought this for my son, but I hoped I could figure it out.  I have always liked the Sonic collection and wanted to continue to be a kid with my son.  I like the graphics and the sound, and the improvements made to the old plateaus and tricks, just wish I had more time to access my kid inside.  My son loves this and has beaten the game before I got past the first set of acts.<br />sigh...
B00138EV8U|5.0|The music of this CD evokes feelings of love and happiness. Love every song. Great for someone who loves the movie and really for anyone who really loves music.
1451668945|1.0|I struggled with this book, I feel it is the worst one she ever wrote. Do not recommend. It took over 3 weeks to finish and I am an avid reader.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Am a huge fan of George R. R. Martin. Would love to meet the man that dreamed up this fantasy world that seems so real. Dragons, face changers, and the like can be found in this book and in the series. I love the characters and when any of them die, as there is a lot of death in these novels, it hurts. The books are a long read and the stories make it worth taking the time to invest in reading them. Some gruesomeness but I think it’s what I would expect people to be like back in the day.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Verry relaxing.  Listen right before I turn off the light. It helps sleeping.I don't have seven more words to say.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Daenerys, Tyrion, Arya and Jon are my favorite characters. Please don't kill them off! POV from too many characters, including many that I do not care about, but of course, I still read it. This is a wonderful series and I suggest you start with book 1. Sci-fi, history, kings and queens, murder, incest, loyalty, and dragons all in one book.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|It's about the forced ingestion of mercury, other metals and dyes as evidenced by the different colors of veins protruding.  It's about slashing open our boys' faces to examine the difference in bone structure that means one race is prettier than the Orcs who invaded their neighbors and destroyed the world.  It's about \\"medical\\" experimentation to attempt to recreate beauty - and what country is FAMOUS for their plastic surgery transformations, neh?<br /><br />It's about the prisoners of war who saw their very youngest and prettiest soldiers taken away and toyed with by the goblins who had no respect for human decency nevermind the Geneva Convention.  The pleasure that was taken on any male who had the temerity to be gentle, refined and prettier in appearance than their rapists was not only assaulted repeatedly but also had their faces cut open and forced to live a bit longer as if to be tortured by no longer being beautiful to look at.<br /><br />All these things happened in concentration camps, prisoner of war camps and invaded monasteries throughout China and Mongolia.  This IS what they do when you can't even protect Dokdo and Diaoyutai from them.<br /><br />It's about being so incredibly petty and stalkerish as to know that the Chinese consider a broken eyebrow to be a bad sign and then you took the trouble to slash our boys' brows and decades later, American rappers would shave their eyebrows and create a trend.<br /><br />What's the companion to this?  A fairy tale about scabies and carbunclees and acid to the face?
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Buy it<br />Read it<br />Pass it on to friends<br />Talk about it everywhere you go<br />Make people feel annoyed that it's all you talk about<br />Yeah, the series is that good
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This is an amazing doc that takes you on a good adventure of a los angeles studio through the 60's to present. Good heart and great interviews. Dave Grohl directs this with an amazing personal story and some rocking interviews . The man can't seem to do wrong it captured a time and place documentary perfectly my only regret was not being there my self.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I watched this BBC series in full and thought it was great.  It keeps you in suspense until the very last.  Great acting too and so many suspects.  Watch it - it's well worth it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a very informative book but also easy to read. I learned a lot and didn't want it to end.
B00DVXVMT6|4.0|I was skeptical to buy this album because I was pretty disappointed with \\"The Age of Hell\\", but the reviews convinced me, and they were spot on! It really is a return to \\"Resurrection\\" but with far more complex drums. It's a ton of fun to listen to. I've been headbanging in the car to nothing but this for the past week. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because of my only 2 gripes. 1) The studio quality kinda sucks. It's poorly mixed, and it almost sounds like they exported the album in 128kbps audio. It's a bit of a let down, but is fairly easily ignored when the excellence of music is hammering your ears. 2) The lead solo's are nowhere near as good as they used to be.<br /><br />If you can get over that, BUY THIS ALBUM. You'll love it. My favorite song is \\"Kings of the Shadow World\\". Listen to it every day.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Hulk and Iron Man really make this movie.  The guy they got playing Banner is just like the original from the 80s series.  Too bad they couldn't have gotten a better actor to play the part of Thor.  This one is so dull.
1423113454|5.0|My 15 year old read this series a couple of years ago.  Now my 11 year old is starting them.  They really enjoy Mr. Riordan's work.
8866131350|4.0|Very handy and adorable planner. Love all the extras! Pricey but worth it.  Will buy for next year as well
B0023SDPS6|3.0|Was a little disappointed.  Probably would not have been had I began reading this series before I became a huge fan of the A&E series.  Recognized the plot immediately -- however, due to TV license, they changed it to being arrows and that it was one of the boys involved in the crime.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Love this series and loved this season. It's a must watch. The actors and story line are phenomenal. Buy or watch it today.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Thank you Craig for opening your heart and sole to share your pain and growth is truly American in every way.
B003E48AYC|2.0|While the external packaging was fine when I took the shrink wrap off the case and opened it I discovered that the discs had floated around in the case and the DVD is too far gone to be used.  Luckily I was able to clean the Blu Ray disc and it works.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is amazing! If you don't have it you should really get it. The only thing I noticed is that it's like temple run and subway surfer combined but with boss battles. 5 Stars!
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Why can't today's movies be 1/2 as classy. This is just a wonderful classic. Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.  Wow. It doesn't get any better
B00563K3DA|5.0|Refreshing take on slowing down our hectic lives to enjoy the time we have. Live in the now and focus on what really matters. Great read, highly recommended.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|This show is really great if you're looking for something out of the ordinary.  It is fast paced with plenty of action, mixed with complex character development.  You'll find an intriguing main group of characters along with a great supporting cast all with their own backgrounds and life stories.  I'm hoping to see this series continue as it's really fulfilled my need for something unlike all the sitcoms I've been watching lately.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I chose this book because I heard someone say it was really great and they were right... I cried my little eyes out and it was definitely worth reading!
1608871827|5.0|the book is completed as one of the best movie concept art book I've ever bought. I'll definitely buy anything from this publisher again.
B007AL48UK|4.0|I mean, I get it. It's nice to stare at new tiles and stuff. However, the main game, called \\"247 Mahjong\\" by the same developer, also sits on my device. I bought that one back in March when it was the free app of the day (and I still love it and I still play it and I still appreciate it! I gave it 5 stars, after all!). That version has lots of puzzles and here's the issue I have: I'm not understanding why they don't just release themes (free and/or paid) for the original game in order to give it more value? Why do they keep repackaging the game engine over and over and over again? It just doesn't feel right when these themed versions are basically just multiple copies of the same game. That's just going to waste my storage space. It seems silly and inefficient to me.<br /><br />I get that this is the free app of the day today only, but normally this is 99 cents.<br /><br />I'd rather buy a theme pack for 99 cents but instead I now have to have two or more copies of the same game installed on my devices? That just doesn't make sense to me and seems to be a waste of my storage space so I deducted 1 star this time, sorry. While this may be a very good game, I just don't think that this type of marketing is reaching the level of excellence that would grant it 5 stars. I think it actually subtracts from the overall experience of playing the games from this company. Not by much, but definitely enough to knock off a star
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wonderful novel!<br /><br />A great story covering all aspects of World War II.  Strong characters made a captivating book that was hard to put down.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Great fun. Great story. Great artwork which is key for me. We have watched it several times,and will again this Christmas season.
B003F5NSTW|4.0|Lionel Shriver has captured the restless mood of contemporary America and the effects of middle class complacency on a family destroyed by an adolescent boy's incapacity to feel as others do. In turning his intelligence and perceptiveness to destruction, he reflects the dangers of growing up with a sense of entitlement in a society that subjects him to no real sanctions. Shriver's prose is cool, practical, evocative, and the book is structured so that the horrors that unfold still leave plenty of room for the shocking drama of its final scenes. It is a portrait of affluent America today; on the surface still Norman Rockwell sunniness but in fact writhing underneath with the impossible-to-resolve difficulties of modern life.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Love both stars in just about all the other stuff they do, but this one really let them down. If not for the blood and gore, there would have been no movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|can be tricky sometimes. keeps your mind thinking and is a nice way to wind down. need more levels to get by now
B009MF5BXK|2.0|These guys would have nothing to do.<br />The action was not very good. Chuck Norris was a waste of time. The action was limited to gun play and none of the strengths were used by the characters.<br />Why Harrison Ford would sign on to  number four is beyond me.
0525478817|4.0|I can't say enough about this book. John Green's style of writing is fantastic, and I loved this novel's raw look at terminal illness. I can't claim to have any deep knowledge or experience with cancer and other terminal illnesses, but the writing made me feel these characters' struggles. It is a wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone who is new to John Green's writing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Feel like a kid on a scavenger hunt.<br /><br />Can't wait to see more levels.  Keep them coming.<br />I love it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is the best I ever played in the world. my brothers play it I cant I don't how can someone make it free please
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Would love to play this game since so many people give high raves about this game.  Unfortunately, the game is stuck at the &quot;loading&quot; screen just as others reported.  I'm on a Google Nexus 7, Android 4.3
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|Such a great film with great action sequences and somewhat tasteful humor. You've gotta love the superheros, powerful weapons, and martial art moves.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie very much. We had not seen it when it originally came out.<br />Laughs and adventure, my kind of movie.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Seriously, the only reason why I love this movie so much is the actress/comedian Rebel Wilson. Other than that, it's an adventure where every character has their strength and flaw, but the protagonist more annoying than others. If you don't like glee clubs, this film isn't for you.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Love the game I would recommed it to anyone who likes a challenge.Just try the game.you may like it very much.
B000FC1RCI|3.0|If you have read one of the earlier editions, then you will notice a change. &#34;Indian Island&#34; has been changed to &#34;Soldier Island&#34; and other phrases have been edited to make them more politically correct as well (although not the potentially offensive references to the Jewish character). The story remains as ever, and if not for the editing I would give it 5 stars.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Ok, I'm ready for an update.<br />I've been through Adventure twice and I've got all the Achievements.<br />So now it's time for you to give me what I paid for; that right I want the Zen Garden and all the other bits it's missing.<br />Thank you in advance :)<br />(I'm sure this will fall on deaf ears just like all the other bad reviews)
B0091LS07E|5.0|So relaxing to listen to her voice! I bought it for all my friends & family! It is a must have!
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I had heard some of their songs, but didn't know who sang them. This was an Amazon recommendation,. I listened to some of the samples, and just had to download . Been listening at work, had lots of co-workers commenting how they love them as well.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|This app downloaded just fine to the Kindle Fire, but that is as far as you can get.  It will not function properly.
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|I rated 'On Writing&#34; at five stars because it was honest and inspiring to read the personal experiences of a writer such as Stephen King
0553801473|2.0|A sneak peak at the next book in the critically acclaimed series of A Song of Ice and Fire...<br /><br />Chapter 1 - Jeor Mormont's Raven<br />\\"SNOW, SNOW, SNOW!!!  CORN...CORN...DEAD...DEAD...DEAD!!!\\"<br /><br />Chapter 13 - Hodor<br />\\"Hodor\\".<br /><br />Don't laugh...the way the last two books have gone, it could happen.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|From page one I felt like I was back in second grade listening to the teacher read it to the class. I enjoyed it every bit now as I did then. From the fun and light way it's written to the innocence of the main characters not understanding they already had what they sought. It was a warm and comfortable experience I'm sorry to say took me so long to experience again.<br /><br />As is the case with most books made into movies, there is a vast difference between the two, but that did not detract from my enjoyment of this classic.<br /><br />A fun and wholesome story, I'm definitely going to remember this for my kids.
B00C061I1M|5.0|This is a great release that's hard to stop listening to. It is totally unique.  I caught Valerie June playing banjo at a Memphis club a few years ago and was knocked out.  She was unique in appearance, had a voice to match, and she was playing blues on a banjo. Her voice reminded me of Jessie Mae Hemphill's -- old and wise, but childlike too. When we talked about her music, she revealed a great enthusiasm for the American roots musicians she had learned from.  I bought her solo CD off the bandstand and have listened to it a lot since then. With \\"Pushing Against A Stone\\" Valerie June has taken a giant leap toward landing a unique place in music.  Much the way Bob Dylan did with \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", remaining himself while wrapping his music up in a package unlike any heard before, June has done the same with her new release. Her melodies would be beautiful alone, but the arrangements add luscious textures -- strange sounding fuzz guitars, ethereal vocal doubling and echoes, horns, percussion and banjo that all combine to create a general feeling that you have gone back in time in some futuristic way. What does that mean? It means the release will surely grab your ears. Buy it.
1781162646|4.0|As a huge Stephen King fan, I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I love his coming of age stories like The Body so add that to a murder mystery with a little supernatural sprinkled in and I'm hooked.<br /><br />The thing to know about Joyland is it's a very fast read for King, and that fit the story itself as we follow twenty-one year old Devin Jones as he looks back on what he calls \\"the best and worst\\" year of his life. We're taken through his girlfriend dumping him, to him getting a summer job working at Joyland, and him becoming obsessed with a murder that occurred at the amusement park four years earlier.<br /><br />After having her throat cut and being thrown off the side of a haunted ride that's Joyland's equivalent to the Tunnel of Love, the woman's ghost is said to haunt the dark and spooky ride where she was killed. Considering there were at least four other murders over the years similar to it by a mysterious man, Devin's curiosity gets the better of him and he begins to investigate the murders.<br /><br />An easy going kid, he quickly becomes friends with most people working at Joyland while learning \\"the Talk\\" from the other carnies. Joyland quickly became his comfortable place we all look for during the tumultuous and scary time when we're about to go to college or into the real world. One of the people he meets helps to save his life in a way he never expected, but I won't give away any more spoilers. Sorry.<br /><br />In the last couple of pages, there was something I didn't like as it didn't pertain to the story or enhance it in anyway. Overall, it didn't detract enough from the book to make me want to do more than this quick note.<br /><br />I loved the book for its storytelling and the plight of Devin as he has a bit of all of us in him. It's a fun departure from the horror genre that is reminiscent of the Hardy Boys books I used to read.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great app and I love playing it I highly recommend this app it is a really good app.
0761171703|5.0|Not only are the photos breathtaking, awe-inspiring, and down right wicked, the stories that accompany each chapter are very moving.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|The game is cute. Beat up monkeys before they beat you up. The controls are overly simple. After I finish it, I mostly likely will uninstall, but is fun enough to play. The 5 star reviews seems overly complementary for a  game undeserving of such praise. So, I'm assuming most /all are fake.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I felt it was a good app but the free demo was a complete teases there was barely any game play
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I love a book that holds my interest from the first page and never lets go.  This book was interesting and had it all:  mystery, excitement, romance and more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|They have every thing love the update it has every thing but has lots of bugs but that can be fixed<br /><br />  I love minecraft &lt;3
0062255657|4.0|I read this book and soon came to understand it was a fantasy.  I did want to see what happened but overall my review is - Huh?  Had to Google the meaning of the story before I understood.  All I can say is - what an imagination!  I'm not big on fantasy and books that have a \\"meaning.\\"  Give me a good old fashioned murder mystery where the meaning of the story comes with the naming of the killer.  If you enjoy fantasies, you'll most likely enjoy this.  I just want to go to the Hempstock's for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I'm not choosy.
1426308469|5.0|My 4 yr old grandson loves dinosaurs right now and soon as he saw this book on the table, claimed it! Has very nice colorful pictures. The text is a bit over his head but in due time, I have no doubt, he'll enjoy learning every word. Think he 'reads' it every day and already knows the names of several of the dinosaurs. Great book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is so cool I highly recamend every one get this. game if your a minion lover this is the best game to come to!!!!!!!!! get it. now HAVE A NICE TIME
B004T4M5TM|4.0|This is an amusing self-examination of the life of a truly talented writer.  I would like to read more from her.
B00CATSONE|5.0|The author's use of Tesla to demonstrate what traits are necessary for success is brilliant. I was amazed at the scope of Tesla's genius.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|I can't say how bad this film was.... I wish I could get those 2 hours of my life back.... Terrible script, one dimensional characters, and really bad acting. James franco is so bad in this movie I wonder how he even got casted for the role.
B004OZZ624|3.0|The 1st 2/3's of the movie was a little slow for my taste, but it definitely picked up the pace after that. Scale 1 to 10 I'd rate the first 2/3 of the movie maybe a 7.5, but the last 1/3 I'd give it about a 9. So I guess if you have the patience to watch a movie that's kind of slow till the last 1/3 then go for it.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This series gets better and better. It is so unpredictable keeps you wanting more. Kevin Bacon is amazing. I'm hooked.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had mcpe 4 3 years it's grown a lot like pc and xbox soon to be one of the best apps
0525478817|5.0|another amazing book by John Green. I couldn't put it down! So many lines in here I want to go back and highlight so I can remember them forever.  Great quotes in here and amazing writing.  I love this book and all of his others!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Was not able to catch this in the movies. I'm so glad we can purchase it on amazon and watch on our roku. It was such a good show!!
0316098329|5.0|Seems as if it were ripped from the newspaper because it corresponds well with Casey story even though it was written prior to her shattering discovery
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|My husband and i enjoyed it. So convenient to rent a movie to watch on amazon on our roku! Wonderful!
0061950726|5.0|Vivian and her modern day counterpart research and parallel their lives in the system - what they did without and what they endured and discover times change us all but people are basically the same and those similarities are the ties that bind.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|So exciting! Such a good show, it is based on a real life story. Great that shows can be rented online on amazon!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|NO WORDS...JUSTIN IS THE BEST if you love his music you will love this CD he gets better with age!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|My other half liked a song in the album. Bought it as a gift for him. Came in the mail fast!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|easy to play and something to do when waiting for a few minutes or an hour. you never know what may be coming at you next.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|It's a funny show. My husband and i enjoyed it. So convenient to rent a movie to watch on amazon on our roku! Wonderful!
159420229X|5.0|In a truly narrative style, Foer explores all things related to memory, including how memory helps make us human.  As a bonus, it's helped me develop some new ways to remember what's in my refrigerator!
B002361MLA|5.0|I found this to be a very interesting and inspiring read bringing knowledge to what is truly meant by living in the NOW.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|i like this series, more so because Rose is in it. I like Billie Piper as Rose in Doctor Who.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Quick playing combination of first person shooter and third person action. The game is free but you will get asked between scenes to buy upgrades. So far the updated weapons and gear have not been necessary to complete a scene, but would very likely make them easier and maybe more fun.  Happy so far!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This is a classic book! At one point or another everyone needs to read this book. I'm glad I read it. Very exciting and adventurous. Overall a great boom.
0307271080|5.0|I was encouraged by the music video for Omawumi's \\"If You Ask Me\\" to take a chance on a Nigerian novel.  That sense of humor and strength and confidence in Omawumi's music also pervades this novel which has a very basic off-putting cover design and an unfortunate title.  It feels more expansive than [[ASIN:B00AP2VQEM Crazy Rich Asians]]which sometimes feels very claustrophobic - this writer feels maybe more talented, more open but Crazy Rich Asians is easier to pick up because it is fantasy and luxury.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Tyler Perry's new soap opera on Oprah Winfrey's cable channel for more of the same DETAILED, gossipy, shrewd storytelling.
B00024I2Z4|3.0|A little too much politics in a cartoon movie for kids. What do they call that? Oh, yeah, brain-washing. Could have lived without it.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Ever since Born this Way, whenever I encounter a Lady Gaga song for the first time, it always takes more than one listen to find myself really getting into it.  This wasn't any exception.<br /><br />The verses are a little lackluster, but it's the dual chorus that makes this worth five stars, easily.  It's the epitome of \\"hook, line, and sinker\\".  And considering this is the same artist that gave us Born This Way, Judas, and Marry the Night, that shouldn't really be a surprise to anyone.  It seems to be a part of Lady Gaga coming into her own sound as she matures: delivering such a catchy chorus (and not in an annoying way!) that you have to immediately play it again four or five times.<br /><br />As usual, she's got a Synth-SF background colorful enough to make your average synesthete go nuts, a melody that wanders effortlessly through her extreme vocal ranges, and lyrics that make you scratch your head on occasion... all wrapped up into a deceptively feel-good song!  It's easy to get lost in, and all the more so the more you listen to it.  Definitely worth the buy.
B00275EHJG|3.0|The kids like it. Not so much for adults. Got a lot of cleaning done while they were mesmerized by the movie.
B003VBNN7C|5.0|Good choice, fun movie. John Goodman makes for some good humor. Not refective of actual &#34;Coyote Ugly&#34; saloons. Close if it is weekend night after 10:00pm.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Great for kids and adults. Humorous, thoughtful, sweet. Probably Depp's best role since he isn't allowed in the costume closet.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great plot, great production values, and great acting. While this show may seem to be another \\"pretty\\" drama designed to attract the pop culture generation, this film incorporates the fundamentals of film to deliver a satisfactory product.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book.  It was a very unpredictable and suspenseful story.  I guessed a different outcome 17 different times and none of them were close.  A must read!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I love every moment and word ... I didn't want the book to end, and am soon to download another of Emily's books. It's like Darcy and Ethan are part of the family .... Beautiful messages along the way - forgiving self and changing what needs to be changed about ourselves. Realizing our part in dysfunction while also cutting people slack was a message too. Written with warmth and color ... I love this book!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have never been drawn into a series of books as I have this one!!!  I can't wait until the movie in November!!
0399255370|5.0|This book is a winner for sure.  It is absolutely one for your private collection, a must-have, a keeper.  It is a debut book for the author, Drew Daywalt, and Oliver Jeffers is \\"THE illustrator\\" man to partner with.  The book is narrated by individual disgruntled crayons who have their \\"day in court\\" and try to explain their grievances to their owner Duncan.<br /><br />Duncan just wants to colour but when he opens up his crayon box he is confronted with letters of protest from each of its residents.  Red is unhappy and overwhelmed because of overuse.  Neurotic Purple is having a breakdown because he's a neat-freak and Duncan sometimes colours outside of the lines.  He states,\\"If you don't start colouring inside the lines soon, I'm going to lose it.\\"  Grey is throwing in the towel because of misuse.  He always gets the BIG jobs like colouring in the whales and elephants...come on give me a break.  White is feeling neglected and non-existent and feels all empty inside because if she didn't have a black outline no one would know she was there.  Black is beginning to hate just being the \\"outliner.\\"  Beige is tired of playing second fiddle to brown.  Green seems happy and well adjusted but Orange and Yellow are not speaking to each other and are driving him crazy.  Blue has a legitimate complaint as he is worn down to a stub with all of his contributions to Duncan's art.  Pink is calling foul because she thinks she is being discriminated against because she is a girl.  And don't get me started on Peach.  Poor Peach is stripped naked, no underwear, and cannot even come out of the box because she is so unhappy.<br /><br />Duncan reads all the letters and comes to a brilliant conclusion that each colour will be satisfied with.  This book is playful, imaginative and unique.  A perfect book for the back-to-school syndrome that is about to overtake your kids.  I totally loved everything about it and highly recommend it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|So caught up in the story, I love them all, even Thomas & O'Brian (what will they do next). Granny is my favorite. I can't wait to see what happens in season 4.
B00006L83N|5.0|This version includes comments of each bandmembers about each song. The album is excellent, the songs and permofance of the musicians are very good.
B00000J2PH|5.0|My husband could not figure out what to get me for my 51st birthday and I suggested that he get me a CD with songs that suggest nostalgia to me.  He couldn't have picked a better CD.  It was very hot on my birthday and we were both lazing in the sun listening to Carole King.  It was heaven,
B004CURZFC|5.0|love Owls!!!! Loved the movie my daughter has watched it about 10 times I need to just buy the movie...lol
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I love Dave Grohl!  He is a truly original artist that works very hard to preserve the integrity of music!  He deserves a lot of credit for making this documentary!  It will be considered an archive in the future.  It contains interviews with music legends and tells stories that would surely never be known to everyday people like us but will be truly appreciated for their humor and place in music history!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Just found the movie absolutely wonderful. Yeah, the dancing was great, but so was the moral and push of the story.
B002C39TTQ|5.0|Morrissey and Marr are a superlative songwriting duo; every song is absolutely gorgeous. I really don't know what else to say.. It's perfect.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|got this for my 3 year old grand daughter - she loves it. the minions and their voices crack her up.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I love this app and it work unbelievably well. I have had this app since I got my kindle fire and I have never had any problems!!!! Until lately I have had problems being able to use it or even enter the app. Sometimes I can use it and sometimes not plz fix it!!!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i love it on my kindle fire because i can actually SEE stuff, not like on my iphone where i have to squint, lol!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Subconsciously and the hedgehog 4episode the chipmunk to be the first place in my life of a bit more about this year ago
B008673ZAQ|5.0|love LOVE Sylvia Day! awesome author, great book! every woman should read this series! and LOTS of men too! just saying...
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very challenging on the upper levels. It makes you think. More interesting to go back and try other possible routes.
B00785P2QC|5.0|My sister told me about this game. I find it very addicting if you like to build your own town. It is also great for kids.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Robert Jordan's beautiful plot is intact and well. This book really helps to tie up the Wheel of Time series and is full of memorable moments. It's a pretty awesome roller coaster. Unfortunately, the book is tarnished with a few prime examples of really horrid writing and cliches that I could have done without.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|enjoyed the continued story line of the entire series.<br />characters continue to develop and improve - and new characters introduced
B008XKSW7M|2.0|This is just not a very good movie.  I was even embarrassed to tell friends what movie I was watching because it was so bad.  I just said, &#34;oh, some chick flick&#34;.  I was hoping with the cast that it would be charming and funny, which of course it was in a few moments, but overall I was disappointed.
0679892478|4.0|I loved this story as my children were growing and just had to get the story for my grandkids.  I knew from the price that board book would be different, but I didn't realize it would bug me like it does.  LOVE the book and get it if you are not in love with the full story.  I you know the whole story you may not enjoy this book.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm not a regular gamer but since I received the Kindle HD this game has been a blast to play.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|Downton Abbey, and its inhabitants, both noble and servile, is back to normal life after World War I. However, this does not mean their lives are without trials and tribulations, joys and devastation. Personal problems overwhelm the characters. Triumphs bring them joy and satisfaction. However, the post-war world is starting to change, and the aristocratic lifestyle of Downton Abbey is starting to show signs of crumbling.<br /><br />As in the other seasons of this epic drama, the characters are well defined and realistic, the photography exquisite and full of expression, and the costuming breath taking. Gifted actors speaking well-written, sometimes ironic dialogue make this another season to watch ravenously.
B007AL48UK|3.0|This played well enough but it is not very cuxtoizable and there are not many options either and the colors were a little too light as well. All in One Mahjong was a far superior game and was a FAOTD as well.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|great for buying and selling. easy to look at stuff. search is easy. overall great app. recommend 100% to ebay lover's.
B007STXHTM|3.0|The video was great but in just 6 ft of water for 20 min it had accumulated about 5 drops of water. I can not tell if it is coming from the rear door, buttons or lens area. I am worried what will happen when I go deeper for longer periods of time. I am now testing it with the original door on this new housing which seems to have a tighter fit. Will update.<br /><br />Update: 8/31 Post Dives: I dove multiple times ranging from 25' deep to 80' deep and with the original backdoor and the new housing the camera was leak free. I upped my rating to a 3 because now it seems to work fine but only because I thought to try my original door. Even at that I did not trust it so I packed small pieces of paper towel into the housing just in case I got some drops.  I will use the rear door sent with this product for non submerged applications and save the working one for dives.<br /><br />Barring the leak issue the housing took amazing video under very high visibility circumstances regardless of depth. I did find that still shots often turned out blurry but that may have been user error.
B007WTFWJ6|5.0|I am a mid level (Just above novice level) developer. I don't get to develop lot of new things but have the privilege of debugging and fixing bugs on daily basis. Some of the techniques mentioned in the book are really very very very useful in understanding the flow of the program. Only if programmer who wrote the code had read through the book It would have saved lot of agony for me :).<br />I highly recommend this book for programmers using OO Language.<br /><br />Thanks
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing book  John! I know he doesn't read these mostly but I loved the book! I was actually disappointed when I finished because I wanted to keep reading! Can't wait for the TFiOS movie!!<br /><3<br />NerdCrafter13XD
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very fun. my 6 yr. old and 11 yr. old had a blast working these out. it was entertaining to figure out .
B002MFV2IK|5.0|This is a funny movie!! It makes us think about whether we would really like tol live forever on this earth
B00EEXST2K|4.0|This movie, while not a masterpiece, makes for compelling viewing. It's got some Lifetime-movie qualities (it tends towards melodrama, the music is soap operatic, etc.) but there's also some interesting performances by Peter Skaarsgard and Amanda Seyfried and an all around tight script. The direction and script really tries to tell the story from Linda Lovelace's point of view and the result is a compassionate portrait of someone who was abused and coerced into a legacy that they wouldn't have chosen for themselves. On a lighter note, the clothes are outta sight!
6305161879|1.0|This product, though we know the film itself is very good, could not be played in Poland, a problem of format.  So we lost our money.
B005HSL626|5.0|Love it.. Had a blast slicing flying fruit. Addictive to see your highest score challenge the teenagers, who has the best slice
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game for a thinking person.  Solve the level in the &quot;perfect&quot; amount of moves.  Frustrating and undeniably engaging.  Quell is great for the mind and has great graphics.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I gave this a four star rating Because of the game... Having said that, I totally do not like The Demon Based Mystery. A Demon is Satan related. I'm really not into the devil... Looking for things, Solving the puzzles,etc. are entertaining. I just wish there was another version of this game that did not include demons.
B00447L4KA|5.0|this is one of those movies I had on vhs and had to get on dvd.  I love it and my teenage daughter discovered it and she is also a big fan. Is it a great award winning film, no but it is a feel good movie that I well keep watching
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Such a strong awesome voice. She is down to earth and her songs are amazing. Easy to sing along to.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Kind of confusing at times and made me want to quit but both my fiancee and I played and we both enjoyed it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Graphics are the BEST! You can train your horse, feed it, or buy things for it. You can also take the most amazing pictures and buy more horses. If you love horses, but live in town, this will be your dream game!!!
B00004R99L|5.0|This movie, although this version is the original is filled excitement and humor, very relaxing to look at, highly recommended.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|brings the main players more into perspective and gives an insight to their thinking brilliantly writen story line. can't wait to read the next book
0679745203|5.0|A truly amazing book.  I don't know what to say about it.  The narrative voice is omniscient and excellent, though somewhat mannered.  The writing style is stunning.  Set in a bombed Italian villa, it's about a nurse, a burn patient, a sapper (bomb disarmer), and a thief/spy.  It begins near the end of the European part of WWII, but reaching back in time, and going on just passed the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  It's an intertwined spy story and multiple-thread love story.  But more than that, it's a story of personal life versus war.  Characterization is deeply intelligent.  It did have flaws.  The time line was confusing.  The sensuality was over-written.  The change of pronouns' antecedent was often confusing, although there was usually a page break to signal a change was a possibility.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My secret minion name PAPOY. I always wanted a minion game but the best part of all is the game is free.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|My wife and i both pay love this game . We pay and help each other every night.it can be very challenging at times.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Very lovely and very easy to listen to.  Everyone seems to love it, too.  I could listen to this peaceful music for hours.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I am in awe as to the power and perspective this app provides me. I live with two WiFi sources and am surrounded by SO MANY other WiFi signals that I am now able to more accurately SEE what's going on around my busy home/apt. I would recommend this app to any person confined to a BUSY WiFi area. The best of signals to you.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Good  - it does it's job.Don't use it as much as as I should. Good if you don't have a smartphone
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is so fantastic. I am a sucker for musical-esqu movies. It's filled with talent, great singers.<br /><br />Skylar Astin is perfection.
0547569653|5.0|This book is amazing. If you're a runner, vegan, or human, this book will change your life.... maybe.... whatever, it changed mine, it's amazing. READ IT!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is by no means the greatest escape game that I've played, but it was entertaining, short lived and most importantly free (would have graded it far harder if it had been a paid app)
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Just plain good, gruesome, and heady viewing.  Enjoy the way the story thread unfolds.  Much action and suspense for even the most demanding movie buff.
B006S080DK|1.0|Stellar cast, beautiful locations, great costumes, awful script. The book is a simple story with very complex characters and subtle nuances. The movie is a simple story with very simple characters, all carefully dumbed down for you and spiced up with some sex. It's a shame that such a great chance for bringing this story to the screen was blown by immensely bad screenwriting.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game is fun but I don't like the fact that to get some items,you need Facebook,and I won't do it. Otherwise, I like it.
B0001EKZOQ|4.0|One of the best records I own. I cant stop listening this! For flamenco/trova lovers. Bebo y el cigala thumbs up!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Loved it, show tunes, talent, love, despair, and personal story lines running parallel to the main story, to keep me interested.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|My husband and I totally enjoyed Chaplin- excellent cast (Robert Downey Jr was extraordinary and it was great to see Dan Aykroyd in his role), lots of history, wonderful costumes, the backdrops, props and scenery  were stunning... we both could have watched it multiple times. Highly recommend!
0399213015|2.0|I had not looked at the specic specs of the book and thought that it was the regular version. When the book arrived it takes a magnifying glass to read the text it's so small. Needless to say I was gravely disappointed!
B00B3EJ292|5.0|one of my all time favorites, have watched it several times<br />Roberto Benigni is great in this movie<br />I give it 5 stars
B00DQVST76|5.0|A breathtaking tour! I watched it live and its a must to own the DVD/Blu Ray. My Question is: When can we pre-order the DVD and Blu Ray in region 2 format? this is extremely important.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|This product is an ok investment.  The soft rubber on the case started rubbing off almost immediatly and the way it stands up on its own is a little flimsy.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|I loved this app enough to pay for the encore version. It was great for finding new songs and titles. WAS. Now for some reason every time I try to use it for a song it pops up a 'you do not own this app' and kicks me to the market where I can pay $5 for the new version. I think not.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Nice base building game. Would be better if more people were online. Will give it one week and if<br />it doesn't get any better I will uninstall.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Totally mindless fun. I got it for free today and it's so dumb that it is fun. Would I pay for it?, for $3 my answer would have to be yes. In going to spend at least week falling asleep playing this game. I estimate it will take maaaybe 2 hours to finish it.<br /><br />Love this awesomely simple dumb game. Sometimes simpler is better.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I lIKE  the guns I seen all these videos of angry birds bossing me around tell it finally<br />Came out in angry birds star wars and you see there's guns cool.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is the first book in a long while that I have  thoroughly enjoyed, and willingly took time out of  my day to stop playing video games and watching movies and anime an  actually read for a few hours. This book was great, and I loved every page. Definitely would recommend to any gamer who just doesn't get enough reason done. Good job, Ernest Cline. I look forward rd to reading absolutely anything  you want to put on the  shelves in the future.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I had never read anything of Sylvia Day's before so I wasn't sure if I was going to like it.... now I'm hooked. You can't help feeling some of the emotions that she describes between Gideon and Eva. While reading this series you also can't help wanting someone to feel that way about you. I would totally give this book.... and series a shot.
B0037B6QSY|4.0|Mindfulness is not presented as mystical or pretentious.  It is very true to my experience of maintaining a witness part of myself in everyday life.  Easier described than done, of course.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great way to push the world away for a bit,  easy to use but enough challenge to keep it interesting.
034580404X|5.0|I have actually not read this yet so I can't review the book content. But came in as promised condition. It is nice to have in my library when I am ready to read it.
B00CUHMUZ4|5.0|I have all of Andre Rieu's DVDs and this one rates in the top 5.<br />The audience in this dvd confirms the above.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Once I worked it out not bad game. May not think that when I get to the hard ones.<br />If any
B00E8B1358|3.0|It's so much easier going into a movie knowing what to expect. The anger and disappointment are non existent!<br />Let me begin by saying: I like The Rock. I'll continue with: hubby's liked GI Joe since he was a kid. The combination made for an action movie with a minor plot, ok acting, pretty good action, and cheese-ball humor. It kept me watching, which is more than I can say for the first GI Joe attempt.
0062183591|5.0|Thank you so much for this text. It met expectations and has proved to be a wonderful additional to my collection.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I read this series last year. Then I found out it was being made into a movie. The books were just so entertaining I hoped with all my heart that the books were worth the attempt, as any book reader can understand. Hunger Games came through!<br /><br />For the most part, everything in the movie is about what I'd pictured in the books: the main actors, the cities, the outrageous makeup... Come to think of it, I'm racking my brain trying to remember what didn't match.<br /><br />It's interesting because the books were released under the 'young adult' category. However, if you look beyond the obvious boy-girl story, the dystopian, hardship tilt is perfectly fitted to adult interests.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|The story does not need a lot of bells and whistles.  That is why I liked this version more than the one that came out in 2013.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I don't personally think this was as good as the percy Jackson series but I think it has potential. Especially if percy comes back.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is just so oddly addicting and definitely helps kill time when i want a challenge. so i highly reccomend getting this
0064471837|5.0|Probably one of my favourite novels, Sabriel is a rich and believable fantasy. Sabriel is thrust into the position of Abhorsen in order to find her father and stop a powerful evil, and although she does not want the role of Abhorsen, she does her best with what she knows to save the living. Sabriel is an incredibly real character who lives in two incredibly real worlds that are only separated by a wall-- the novel breathes of magic that will touch you through the pages and leave you wanting more of Charter magic, girls of duty, and the sound of bells.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Playing the game asked to update kept asking to go to store but their isn't any so I no longer can play!
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|great action, ridiculous gratuitous violenc.  definitely dont let you kids watch this, strictly for adults.  looking forward to kick ass 2!
B005BY3XHC|5.0|This is one author that has deeply touched me. He has a powerful understanding and awareness of the seven spiritual laws of success and I thank him for writing succinctly and clearly for us to follow. I read it years ago but plan to read it again.Kudos to him!
B00DP7NKFW|3.0|But with every Jane Austen novel, you need some patience with the Victorian style narrative. Lots if unnecessary detail. But good.
1401937519|5.0|I was so captivated by the book that I refused to let it down.Her near death experience and her emotions and thoughts as she went on the &#34;other side&#34; is absolutely powerful. She knew when she got there that there would be no trace of cancer in her body. However, physicians refused to believe her and insisted on doing many tests.When all tests came out negative for cancer they were awestruck, She learned to conquer fear with love. Her recommendations for all the readers are so pragmatic that I would say this is a &#34;must&#34; book for everyone. Through her book, she lifts others up and gives us hope. The commentary by Wayne Dyer adds  to her  profound experience. I love it, love it! Congrats to her for an exceptional treatise on NDE. I gave my copy to my brother and will be ordering one for myself
B003UESJFG|4.0|This is one of his favorite movies!  He is always pointing out the funny parts to me, and there are a lot.
B000000OAC|5.0|What can be said about Queen that has not been said already.  This album has the hits We Will Rock You and We are the Champions.
0786962984|5.0|So I never write reviews, but felt compelled to share my personal experience with this game. Over the past 6 months or so I've been purchasing various board games to enjoy during weekly \\"Family Nights\\" at home. I've collected a number of games that most people would consider staples (Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, etc.) but was looking for a simple and fun way to introduce my 11-yr old daughter to tabletop gaming of the fantasy variety. ;-D<br /><br />So one Sunday afternoon, after receiving a number of goodies on Saturday in the mail, we open and punch out the pieces for Dungeon! About a couple of turns into the session she exclaims, \\"This is the FUNNEST game I have EVER played!\\" I could tell by her smile and intensity in her voice that she was not just saying what Daddy was hoping to hear. This couldn't have been any Anyway, this game is simple, fast and engaging. I might even be able to get my wife to play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have checked and this game has the best rating in the app store! Best. App. Ever. Keep it up MC fans! Best app in the store and any MC player should try this with my 100% respect!<br />This app could be the only app in the app store and android owners would be entertained! The only con? Too expensive for some.<br /><br />100% &quot;You gotta try this!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and addictive. It's late but I can't stop playing. I'm going to regret this whole I'm at work tomorrow.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Having read &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and really liking it, I expected &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; to be good.  I was not disappointed.  Hosseini is a wonderful writer.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I read the book and I think  I was a bit let down that the movie didn't follow the book 100%. Of course due to  time restraints, the movie couldn't have everything in it that the book had going.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence was amazing and completely believeable as the heroine. She is tough, yet pretty.  Stanley Tucci was superb in his role as well.<br /><br />I think the plot line is fascinating, although sad. The plot could fortell what the future citizens of the USA may encounter at some point due to an overly  large and out of control government who has to subdue its peoples in order to have control over them.<br />The starkness of the wealth and lavish lifestyle  of the people of the &#34;Capital&#34; verses  the &#34;regular&#34; people who live in poverty,  in run down homes and basically starve, having few comforts, is quite eye opening.<br /><br />I recommend the movie, it is both oddly entertaining and yet scary as to what the future could hold.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|As I have read many reviews reporting porn ads being displayed in the app's ad banner, I myself can confirm fraudulent detection of a virus being discovered on my device, which is being displayed in the ad banner. If a developer chooses to implement, and/or allow these types of immoral inclusions in their software, then generally speaking, how can they be considered trustworthy?<br /><br />While this app does download YouTube videos, my biggest concern is what else it may be doing in the background. Is this app worth the risk of accidentally touching the ad banner, and then be at risk for whatever happens next? I think not.<br /><br />If you were to check for yourself on other sites, or by other sources, I wish you all the best in determining which of the many offerings of TubeMate is the &quot;official&quot; version. If this app's author is the original, then based on what I've already learned, and partially shared, my decision has been made all across the board.<br /><br />The best, straightforward app that I have found for downloading YouTube videos is JetVD. Unfortunately, they are a bit &quot;slow&quot; at times to get out an update, and currently seem to only have the &quot;lite&quot; version on their site where I usually have been able to get the &quot;Plus&quot; version.<br /><br />After posting this review, I will be uninstalling this app, and continue to use JetVD.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|..But this book was amazing. Such a beautiful high school love story.  I couldn't put it down! When I finished this one, I immediately picked up her other novel &#34;Attachments&#34;, totally worth it.  So glad my kindle helped me stumble upon Rainbow Rowell. :)
B00ADS98FC|5.0|It is fun to actually watch a movie that has talent, a good story and hilarious!  Watched it twice and enjoyed 2nd time as if I was seeing it for the first time.  Would highly recommend if you want something fun to watch.  Plan to purchase it to view when needing a boost.
B00CU8OVIM|3.0|I got this as a gift, so at least I didn't waste any money.  There is nothing original about this album, just another performer using the music from hits made by real artists.  Now I understand why he had to buy so many copies of his own CD when it came out.
0812532538|5.0|It's a classic book, Ender's Game is a must read for everyone, all ages. Love all of Orson Scott Card's books!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I have been using this case for about 2 weeks now and haven't had any issues.  I really like the magnetic turn on and off; it does work with the Kindle placed in the case either way. I also really like the elastic closure strap. The no-slip pad does well to prop the Kindle up at different angles for viewing.  I almost dropped it once and the Kindle stayed attached in the clips; I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy it is.<br /><br />I would recommend this case to family and friends.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Pure old school classic used to play this on my old computer but like this is way better than a computer program if u like uno you will love uno online
B003P2WO5E|1.0|Here's how I review. No synopsis, no narrative. Just get to how I was introduced to the book, what I liked and didn't like and maybe some spoilers. Enjoy!<br /><br />I am a big Brandon Sanderson fan so that is why I tried to read through The Way of Kings.<br /><br />::: Things I liked :::<br />-I really liked the concept of the world.  It was interesting to see the people, animals and plants and how they adapted to live in a world with constant High Storms.<br />-I also really liked the idea of Shard plate and blades.  The effects of the frost and water condensation were an awesome touch!<br /><br />::: Things I didn't like :::<br />-#1 reason I did not like this book was that it was LONG and BORING.  You spend so much time with the same characters in the same situations that you end up begging for something different to happen.<br />-Spren! Spren are annoying! I think a good third of this book is comprised of sentences like, \\"blank spren appeared in this way etc.\\"  They don't do anything and do not serve a purpose!<br />-The story NEVER seemed to move along.  There was no crescendo, climax or even tension.  *Spoiler- the only time I ever got a little tense was when Shallan started drawing the weird angular head guys--End Spoiler*.<br />-This book had a lot of the things I like about Sanderson's writing (interesting concepts, magic systems etc.) but it also bored me to death...<br /><br />::: The Verdict :::<br />When reading any book I have a 20% rule.  I always read the book until the counter on my kindle reads at least 20%.  I got to that point and pushed on through 40, 60 and finally 87% hoping that this book would get better.  Sadly, it never did. Maybe it was just that I do not like these lengthy fantasy novels (this was the first I have ever read).  However, I think it is because it is genuinely disappointing.  This book rates lower than Elantris in my opinion.  I give it 1/5 stars.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|It's a wonderful app but it needs more ease in selecting the music from album or from a single. I have a difficult time toggling g between those choices. But all in all it satisfies my dj desires. Thanks
0064471837|5.0|\\"If a movie is really amazing [...] you can't ruin it by giving the plot away. The plot is incidental to everything else,\\" said oe of Kevin Wilson's characters in \\"The Family Fang.\\" This is certainly true for Sabriel. Although the plot IS engrossing and original and super duper, it's often incidental to the character development, the pacing, and the spectacular fantastical setting.<br /><br />Nix is a wordsmith who forges sensations and emotions. The world Nix builds is incredibly vivid. It's easy to imagine it. Moreover, I can't help but feel the sense of fear when I try to imagine the landscape ravaged by the unseen creatures. The pacing is perfect, juxtaposing scenes of intense action with introspective moments, tense moments of unease with restful respite. The star of the book, though, is Sabriel herself. Sabriel embodies the most underrated and rarest of superhero qualities: competence. So rarely do I encounter young women in fiction who are just nice, empathetic, and just plain capable. She is so cool that I'm going to be her for the next convention. I can't really express how much I love her, so you'll just have read for yourselves.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|OMG I LUV THIS BOOK SO MUCH!!! 5 stars!!I'm so happy I chose this book for my summer reading project
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked the storyline.  The relationship does seem too good to be true.  Couldn't put my kindle down, definitely had me hooked. Can wait to start the second book.
140006922X|4.0|I found the background information very revealing.  It helps to establish the mood around Christ at His time in History.  A lot of passages in the Gospels make more sense having read this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|U can even hack it. He game is awesome.I just wish I could figure it out. It is so hard
B00785P2QC|5.0|.Not bad of a game do hate that the game requires to post stuff on Facebook which I hate using
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I use this app not just for entertainment but to learn various do it yourself projects for around my house
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great way to spend time. I enjoy the portable devices that can be used anywhere. Just like the regular game we all know and love.
B008M87GJK|5.0|They offer the news from various angles and not just the liberal views.  Get news I don't often get here at home.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Would recommend to anyone who love games that make you concentrate and think. 2 thumbs up! Never get tired of hidden objects games.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have never been so into a series like I am with Downton Abbey..love it and will recommend it to anybody
B0040I09RM|5.0|When this show first came out on FX, I started watching it and found I couldn't get through past episode 2.  I thought I would love it when I heard about it, I had gone out with a biker in my youth and really wanted to follow the show.  Well. Timing is everything, so they say.  I never watched past episode 2 then, but just watched FOUR (4) FULL SEASONS on Netflix in the span of a week. I'm so addicted!  Charlie Hunnam is wonderful.  So is practically EVERY other actor in the show.  I don't know how these cable TV stations do it, but they get amazing casts together for amazing shows.  If you haven't watched this yet, watch it now.  I'm starting Season 5 tomorrow (but have to actually pay per episode on Amazon); I cannot wait to wake up!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it. Smaller pages? No problem, just turn them more. And It is always with me, at the dentist, store, doctor, quiet time, whatever, always ready to go.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I've been reading Grisham's work since he first became a best-selling author and, unlike some, his work just keeps getting better. With complex characters, an unexpected plot, and subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) humor, I finished the book in record time and with a smile on my face.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the entire series and I just wish that there was more to read. I LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES TRILOGY!!!!!!
B008OOYALE|1.0|aweful and boring and not easy to figure out with no direction... Seriously, thats all I had to say but Amazon wants more words to describe the program... pass on it... even though its free... pass on it
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Love special effects and everything about this movie.  Especially thought the Jack's hideaway made for some of the coolest scenes in the movie.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Very entertaining. Stunning visual imagery with a great story ands Morgan Freeman in fine form.  Kept me riveted to the stories conclusion.
B00DW5IKJI|4.0|If you take a look at Britney's discography on Wikipedia, you'll know this is her 5th greatest-hits album domestically and abroad since Greatest Hits: My Prerogative in 2004. Therefore, this is for sure the latest Britney collection you can get that truly includes most of her hits, dance music or ballads. Therefore, if you like her music but never got a chance to buy any of her music, this should be the choice for you.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you're already a die-hard Britney fan, then buying this album probably doesn't give you anything new but simply adding another item to your overall collection. All the singles before Femme Fatale are the re-mastered versions from the Singles Collection in 2009, but if you didn't buy the deluxe box that actually had all the CD singles, this collection does offer you the re-mastered versions of the songs that didn't make it to the single CD edition of the Singles Collection. 3 singles, however, are still missing. They are \\"Born to Make You Happy,\\" \\"I love Rock n' Roll\\" & \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know.\\" The inclusion of \\"Scream & Shout\\" is nice but odd, because it's technically a will.i.am song. Besides, if it includes \\"Scream & Shout,\\" why not \\"S&M?\\" In my opinion, it could have been commercially appropriate to include \\"Ooh La La.\\" She could save that song for her new album, but since it doesn't even have a release date yet, why not use \\"Ooh La La\\" to promote this greatest-hits album?<br /><br />I want to give it 3 stars because it doesn't have any new materials; I also want to give 5 stars for being the best Britney collection so far, so, I give it 4 stars. In conclusion, the greatness of the greatest-hits album depends on what you already have.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|Alfa AWUSO36H 1000 mw works great so I have been told.  But NOT the AWUSO36NHR 2000mw.  The utility program would not work and the driver not working either.  This might be a good choice if the engineers at Alfa Network, Inc. work out the bugs.  But for now we will have to be satisified with the 1 WATT version.
0553386794|4.0|Finally finished this mammoth book, and I think it's better than the television show. The characters have more depth, and the jumping from place to place makes more sense. It does have its slow parts, but in the end, it's a very rewarding read. I'll be reading the next book after a short break with another novel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's not bad.  It's entertaining.  As an aquascapist it's quite fun.  I found this app as&nbsp;I&nbsp;was meandering through the software realm and struck a curious observance of the high rating.  Give it a try.  Have a fab day.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a very low price for a good camera bag.. I don't have enough accessories to fill it up. It will be a long time before I will outgrow this back pack. Seriously, look at other camera bags.. I was a bit worried about such a low price. One thing.. it's very compact. On me, it looks like a kids back back.. however, it has a lot of segmented compartments to fit a lot of accessories. The side strap fits my tripod for easy carriage.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Kids love it, I love it, good strategy game for the thinker in the family. You will love this game.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I think this game is a good way to pass time when you are bord and plus you get to beat every one at this game .
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is a must-have classic. Its one of my favorite movies and I can watch over and over again. Mr. Darcy is so charming you can't help but fall in love with him.
030758836X|4.0|So now I've read every book that Gillian Flynn has ever written. Three!  I found the first two ( Dark Places and Sharp Objects ) as different from Gone Girl as night is from day.  I spoke earlier in another review about Flynn writing \\"like a man.\\"  Experience the strong language ( \\"Now there's a helluva broad!\\"), kind of shocking if you look at her picture.  What with some of her characters reminding me of Hitchcock, the gory, unladylike scenes, and  the mounting tension reminding me of Sydney Sheldon,  I tend to picture a man in my mind.<br /><br />I think the fact that she is super smart, a trait often attributed, at least in the past to males, ( engineers, doctors,CEO's, presidents, etc.) also puts her in that category.  For example, Amy, the wife,  comes off so much smarter than her husband Nick in the story of a marriage gone south, and the wife disappearing on their 5th anniversary.  Amy wraps him around her little finger giving him clues as to where she is.  She totally manipulates him.  He does a little of it too in the game of \\"my wife is missing.\\"  But he gets the worst of it, He's made out to be the killer.<br /><br />I love the innovative way the story is presented. One chapter is told from the wife's point of view, the next, the husband's.  The only thing is, I occasionally found myself flipping back to the previous chapter to make sure I was on the right track.  I considered this novel a higher-level psychological type of thriller that tends to keep you on your toes.  There's still crime and excitement, but it's more thinking than just feeling.<br /><br />Far from my legal backdrop for thrillers, this novel is equally desirable for me...almost.  Ms. Flynn, please write more, and make them like your first two.
B0028AQLYE|3.0|For the background, I am a Master Swimmer and swim between 4,500 and 5,000 meters 3 times a week. Bought this to add to my FINIS snorkel for two reasons. One (primary), to reduce the air flow for hypoxic training, and two, to keep water out. Both work OK. It took me a while to get used to the snorkel when I first got it - it was already restricting air compared to my natural freestyle breathing. But I got used to it. Now I notice additional reduction again. This really helps me working on efficiency.<br /><br />It does a good job keeping the water out, too, even on flip turns. I may even try it while doing fly.<br /><br />One minor gripe I had with it was around fit. A few reviews and even the enclosed instructions indicated that it may not easily fit into the snorkel, suggesting to warm it up in hot water first. My experience was opposite - this top was too loose and wouldn't stay in. I tried it in two snorkels (my daughter uses one, too), so it's definitely the top and not the snorkel that's defective. However, the fix was easy - I wrapped some electrical tape around before inserting it and it created a good seal.
1455526959|3.0|I'll admit I started this book and put it down several times.  I don't usually do this.  First of all, the title baffled me.  I knew about a \\"black box\\" warning for a drug in medicine ( an FDA requirement that states the most serious thing that can happen to you if you take this drug...It's bordered in black).  And then there's the black box in plane crashes.  So I was constantly on the lookout for the one big thing Harry Bosch would discover that would pull his whole case together.  But there were so many...each one building on the other.  I was really busy throughout the book.  I keep thinking I had it, but with all the twists and turns, surprises and details, another big thing would become apparent.<br /><br />Putting my problems aside, I think the book has value.  I always called Connolly a teacher (like me, if you'll forgive the vernacular):  the way he makes us remember things we might choose to forget such as Desert Storm, The Gulf War, Vietnam, Rodney King, the L.A. riots etc.  We get to learn about the politics that goes on inside the police department, and an amazing procedure for tracing a gun, and, of course, how you might have  the brainpower to figure out how to save your life...over and over again.  It's uplifting.<br /><br />I always love how Connelly gets himself into the mix.  He makes Bosch love jazz (as I do) and takes many opportunities to announce his favorite artists.  I delight in this, and I was introduced to artists I hadn't heard of.  I ran to research them.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Connolly is one of the best in his field,  but I couldn't get into The Black Box ( Excuse the pun).  I loved his other novels:  The Lincoln Lawyer, The Reversal, Blood Work, and others purchased here on Amazon.  I give it 3 stars.
B006RZFACU|5.0|The silly rhymes contained in this short book only serve to make it more fun.  The townspeople simply go about their business in other distinct ways and find that the fog actually brings them closer together as things that weren't normally done are enjoyed again such as board games.<br /><br />A delightful book to be read at bedtime.
1575666286|5.0|I read this as a curiousity as several members of my family are into their late 70's and 80's and more ... As a product of age, they are beginning to encounter health problems.<br /><br />As an Alternative to &#34;Commercial Medicine & Pharma&#34;, I found a lot to really like in these pages. There is a lot of alternative therapy here. Since I have no marked or chronic illness at this time I have not thrown myself wholeheartedly into it but I have tried some of the thinks and found them to be helpful with some of my own problems<br /><br />You can find supplemental films about this therapy on NetFlix
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is a God game with a solid story line.<br />The only problem I have had is some of the objects are to well hidden.
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|I am sorry but i just could not get into this album..its really not a bad album but it seemed to me that all the songs were borrowed elements from previous songs, in other words it didnt sound all that original but that being said other fans might dig that. I just kept hearing the same chorus from \\"hole in the sky\\" throughout. But ozzy does sound good as does the sabbath sound production.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The layout is horrible.  The ads make various portions of the screen literally untouchable.  Using the app is much worse than simply using the desktop version of the web page and making do.  Dreadful.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book is very inspiring. I definitely recommend you to purchase, it really does uplift you and get your mind back on the right path.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|BluRay allows you to watch new effects or old. Very well done.<br /><br />What pi$$ed me off, big time, was the amazon delivery, i tried a drop box, they delivered early and RETURNED it before i was able to collect it. If you give an expected delivery date, give me at least until that date to go get it.  I need to leave town for 3 days, they deliver a week early, i get back, it's already sent back. I need to reorder.  But this is not the Blu-ray's fault.  That was 5 star!
B00BKELJZ0|5.0|I love this album.  It's either the soundtrack to me starting my day, or just allowing me to process a busy day.<br />Beautiful.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I could not get it to open on tablet. Only the ads come up????  Too bad, looks like<br />a fun game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show! I am so glad that I can stream it for free with my Prime membership. Very entertaining.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This is a book that &#34;lives with me&#34; long after a I finish it.  I am not a reader of gothic novels - and this book supposedly has elements of that genre - but I really found it interesting.  Although there are some &#34;dark moments&#34; in the tale, it is mostly the intricate revealing of long-held personal secrets.  The author weaves the tale in such an interesting fashion that there are stories upon stories.  I definitely recommend this book.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I am obsessed with this. What drives me crazy....some days it loads a game and looses the link SO you are out the \\"coins\\" but dont get to play.  I had that happen 3 times last night almost right in a row.  Besides that I get very competitive and could spend hours playing IF you didnt have to buy coins.  I think if you could turn the ones you earn from winning/playing towards the games it would let me play it alot more than I do:)
B003H4I4JU|5.0|A much stronger story than Enders Game.  The human condition explored with deep understanding.  A quick read only because it is difficult to put down.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Purchased this after renting movie &#34;Searching for Sugarman.&#34;  Was not disappointed!  Album includes a good choice of songs and Rodriguez is a talented writer/composer and performer.
B0094KT6T8|5.0|This was one of my favorite videos of the year. I've watched it over and over many times and I can't believe they haven't already started planning for a follow-up for the next book in the series. It was very well done, I I sincerely hope they come out with the rest!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a perfect summer read, nice for the beach or at the campground or just your own bed, wherever you want to take your mind away to some alternative place. In that respect it's like the new Sera Ashling novel [[ASIN:B00ENN6SVK Sleepless (Curse of the Blood Fox Trilogy, Book #1)]] which also carries you away.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like how easy it is to move from device to device and be able to pick up where you left off. It's also very easy to download purchased books, you don't have to navigate through multiple menus which is great!
B00CW665VI|5.0|WOW!!  I LOVED Drew's inner monologue.  This book is in my top 10 books for the year.  LOVE it!  MUST READ/1
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|IM MAD CUZ WHEN I TRY TO PLAY ONLINE I LOGIN THEN I CLICK LOGIN THEN IT LOADS AND SAYS ERROR CONNECTION PROBLEM BUT I HAVE FULL CONNECTION BARS OTHER THEN THAT ITS A FUN GAME.
