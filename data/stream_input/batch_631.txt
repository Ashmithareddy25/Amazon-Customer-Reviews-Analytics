B000J103X4|4.0|I would give this album 5 stars but he lost a point because his flow sounds like Dr. Dre on too many tracks. Dr. Dre is the greatest hip hop producer ever but its time to let go and be yourself. This album is way better the The Documentary, its more consistent. The Game lives and breaths Hip Hop and thats all that really matter. I give Game much credit, this album is pure heart. Why You Hate The Game is one the best tracks I ever heard
B000H0MKGK|4.0|Although I'd heard some of his songs before, this was the first release that I actually purchased.  His voice and guitar work are both understated and impressive.  Highly recommended for even the casual fan...
B000JK8OYU|1.0|In keeping with their latest policy of rewriting music history and perverting the Beatles' catalogue by remixing, overdubbing and editing, Apple has pulled George Martin out of retirement and commissioned him to raid the vaults and produce yet another volume of re-created material. The result? A CD of remixed, edited and overdubbed crap designed exclusively to wring dollars from the ignorant masses, many of whom have never seen a 45 or LP and are willing to shell out money for anything with the name BEATLES on it.    Exactly who would have ever thought that we needed to hear the solo from \\"Taxman\\" slapped into \\"Day Tripper\\"? or the trumpet from \\"Penny Lane\\" stuck onto \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\" Or \\"Sun King\\" backwards?    This album is junk, pure and simple. When it does produce high points, such as in \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" or \\"Revolution,\\" they're edited, so we don't get it all. Everything else is a mixed-up mess. The concept of tampering with the Beatles' precious musical legacy like this is inexcusable.
0790744295|4.0|PLOT: A father (Tom Atkins) finds out that his son Billy (Joe King) has been reading a comic book entitled \\"Creepshow.\\" The father becomes outraged, grounds his son, and throws the comic book in the garbage. Suddenly the Creep shows up to narrate the comic book's five jolting tales of horror.<br /><br />Father's Day: Every father's day there is a family gathering at the Grantham mansion. This year is no exception. Hank Blaine (Ed Harris) has recently married into the family and he wonders why Aunt Bedelia Grantham (Viveca Lindfors) hasn't shown up yet. The rest of the family tell him the story about how Bedelia's father, Nathan Grantham, was such an evil and demanding man. He was so evil that he had Bedelia's fiancee secretly murdered and covered up so she could still take care of him. On one father's day, Nathan became so annoying in demanding his father's day cake that Bedelia murdered him by bashing him over the head with a marble ash tray. The murder was covered up. Every father's day since, Bedelia returns to the Grantham mansion and meditates at her father's grave site first before going into the house. But this year, Nathan is planning on coming back for his revenge... and his cake.<br /><br />The Lonesome Death Of Jordy Verrill: Jordy Verrill (Stephen King), a stereotypical redneck, discovers a meteorite which crash landed on his property. Jordy immediately thinks about selling it to a college so he can get rich. He pours cold water on it to cool it down but this causes it to crack in half. Jordy's dreams are smashed to bits, but then he thinks that he could perhaps glue it back together. He pours out the blue liquid from inside the meteorite and then he collects the two halves. He goes back into his house and then starts to realize that everything that got that blue liquid on it is slowly starting to grow vegetation, including himself. What can he do to stop the growth of these... weeds?<br /><br />Something To Tide You Over: Harry Wentworth (Ted Danson) is suddenly woken up one morning by someone knocking at his door. He discovers that it is Richard Vickers (Leslie Nielsen). Richard has recently discovered that Harry was having an affair with his wife, Becky (Gaylen Ross). Harry says that Becky just wants out of the marriage and that she doesn't even want alimony or any other divorce benefits. Richard admits that he didn't even love Becky, but he is intent on keeping what is rightfully his. He then lets on that Becky may be in danger in a hidden spot on the beach. Richard tricks Harry and burries him up to his head in sand. He shows him a TV monitor of Becky (also burried up to her head in sand) further down the beach and drowning from the incoming tide. Harry knows that the tide will soon come in and drown him too. Richard drives away laughing, but what he doesn't know is that he is the one who is in real danger.<br /><br />The Crate: A janitor at a university discovers a 130 year old crate inside a crawl space underneath some stairs. He calls Professor Dexter Stanley (Fritz Weaver) who immediately drives over to the university to investigate it. Stenciled on the crate is some information about an arctic expedition. The two open up the crate and are horrified to find a living monster inside, which quickly grabs the janitor and pulls him inside. In terror, Stanley finds a grad student upstairs and tells him what happened. The two go downstairs and find the crate right back in the crawl space, as if someone or something had moved it back. The grad student goes to get a close look but the monster gets him too. Stanley goes to the home of his friend Professor Henry Northrup (Hal Holbrook). He tells him the story about the monster in the crate. Henry is very intrigued and thinks that he may have finally found a way to get rid of his alcoholic, emotionally abusive wife, Billy (Adrienne Barbeau).<br /><br />They're Creeping Up On You: A cruel, rich businessman named Upson Pratt (E.G. Marshall) is killing cockroaches in hisgerm-free apartment. Pratt may be evil, but he has one weakness: bugs!!! Every now and then he notices another cockroach in his apartment, and they seem to be bigger every time. Are the roaches slowly taking over his apartment? Is this some kind of punishment for his evil ways?<br /><br />COMMENTS: This is an awesome film that was created due to a collaboration between two masters of horror: director George A. Romero (Night Of The Living Dead (1968), Dawn Of The Dead (1978), Day Of The Dead (1985)) and author Stephen King (Carrie, Salem's Lot, The Shining). This is their homage to the original E.C. comics of the 1950s (Tales From The Crypt, The Vault Of Horror, The Haunt Of Fear.) Instead of the narrator being the Cryptkeeper, it's the Creep. Romero uses several weird angles and exaggerrated lighting in the film so the audience feels like they are actually looking at the pages of a comic book. The stories are great and two of them were actually published as short stories. There is even a comic book adaptation of the film. The comic book used in the film was actually drawn and inked by some of the original E.C. artists. When King saw the cover of the comic book, he thought the boy looked like his son Joe (who was cast as Billy in the wrap-around story.) King himself even plays the part of Jordy Verrill and does a very convincing acting job. The film itself features an all-star ensemble cast. For a little piece of trivia, the marble ash tray showcased in \\"Father's Day\\" is actually shown in every single story. If you watch it, see if you can find it in each story; it's kind of like \\"Where's Waldo.\\" The roaches that were used in \\"They're Creeping In Up On You\\" were specially imported from Brazil. The crew were so freaked out by them that no one wanted to handle them, not even George A. Romero. The story was filmed at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University. Many of the roaches escaped the set and settled in steam vents all over the campus. Nests were found all over the campus for over ten years afterward. The film was so successful that a sequel was made in 1987. Romero didn't direct it, but he did write the screenplay which was based on some new stories by Stephen King. A second sequel is in the works and scheduled for a 2007 release, although neither Romero nor King will have anything to do with it. A remake is also in the works. This DVD features the film in both full screen and widescreen format [note: the widescreen version is just the full screen version with black bars added at the top and bottom.] The disc also contains the original theatrical trailer, but that's it for extras. I would recommend this film to any horror fan, and if you love Tales From The Crypt then you'll really love this.hes in his germ-free apartment. Pratt may be evil, but he has one weakness: bugs!!!

0743454537|4.0|While this book wasn't classic literature, it flowed easily and was difficult to put down. The topic was certainly controversial enough to cause me to contemplate how I would handle the situation had this been my family. I'm not sure if there are correct answers to this one. <br /> <br />A family discovers their 2 year old daughter has an extremely aggressive type of leukemia and is need of a donor. There is no one in the family who matches, and the national registry can take years, if any at all. The parents opt for a genetically engineered child to be conceived for the blood contained within the umbilical cord. However, as the years go by more and more donations are required of this youngest child to keep the older daughter alive. At the age of 13 the youngest daughter files suit against her parents for medical emancipation.  <br /> <br />The book revolves around this legal action, and is told from various viewpoints - the youngest daughter, her parents, her brother, her lawyer, and her guardian ad litem. Through these viewpoints the reader learns the history and dynamics of the family. There have been complaints here that the mother's character seems one dimensional, however I didn't see that. She can come across as a bit of a villain, yes. Yet, I can imagine a mother of a very, very sick child might overly concentrate on the sick child and seemingly neglect other children without fully realizing it. It just worked for me. There are other stretches in the novel, but nothing that is too difficult for me to believe. <br /> <br />The ending - for which much has been made about this novel - was one that I had speculated could happen for this story, so it didn't come as a total and complete surprise for me as it obvious did for some. I didn't feel \\"cheated\\", as I felt the author had already addressed the main issues that needed to be addressed. There are no easy answers to this situation and any ending is going to be difficult, shy of a miracle or divine intervention.<br /> <br />I love books that make me think long after I finish reading them, and this one caused me to do just that. I also like books that allow me to get so caught up in the characters that I can shed a tear when I'm done reading, whether the ending is happy or sad, and this story allowed for that as well. As I stated in the beginning: this is not great, classical literature, but a solid book to wrapped up in on a quiet afternoon. <br />
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I was disappointed with this album. To me it sounds like a hodge podge of a Beatles tribute group that doesn't quite have the transitions down pat. I'm sure this makes for a spectacular accompaniment to the Cirque du Soleil show - something that compliments the act but is not the star of the show.<br /><br />However simply listening to the music alone, it doesn't work for me. REALLY doesn't. Some of the parts made me clench my teeth as if hitting a bad note. I played it for a few friends who agreed. Perhaps if you grew up listening to them and knew them as they were this composition sounds \\"off\\". Now I know why it was so hard finding 30 second snippets to preview the music before buying it.<br /><br />I think this will be one of those split down the middle love it or hate it CDs - it might have more appeal to those who have seen the show or to people who know the Beatles music but are newer to it rather than those of us who remember them when they first came to the U.S. with their \\"shocking long hair\\" and wierd collarless suits.<br /><br />Once again it proves that you shouldn't mess with a classic - even if you did produce it in the first place!<br /><br />I'm editing my review. When I first bought the CD I obviously wasn't that crazy about it. Then we went to Las Vegas and saw the LOVE show. Which was just the most incredible shows you can see - worth every penny for the tickets. Now that I've actually seen the show, the composition of the songs makes alot more sense and I enjoy listening to the CD with memories of that fabulous Cirque de Soleil show.
B000IMV4IW|5.0|When I heard that Oasis was going to release a best of, I wasnt really surprised. I knew it was coming. I just hoped that all their best would really be on the cd. Well, most of them are on here, but there are so many, many more. They should have made a full 2 disk set with 15 or so songs on each one. I have tried to make my friends a \\"best of\\" Oasis cd, and its almost impossible. There are just too many great songs, I always feel bad leaving some out. I need about 4 cds to get all their best songs represented. The band is that good. If you only have whats the story morning glory, or only know 1 song, you should buy this best of cd. Then go out and get the rest!
B0006SSOHC|4.0|saw is definently a good movie that keeps you thinking. the ending completely threw me off, big time. if you've never seen the movie, you will constantly keep guessing but never figure it out. it's almost impossible. this movie was constructed beautifuly.  <br /> <br />the gore scenes aren't that intense....but the plot and everything else makes up for it. by all means there is gore, but it's not unbearable. the acting was good, plot was good, ending threw me off. not a scary movie, but a sick, intense, brilliant movie that will keep you thinking the whole way through. <br /> <br />i am about to watch saw II and then saw III, and i am very excited to do so, i know i'm kind of late on watching the first 2, i wish i would've watched them a long time ago.  <br /> <br />i would definently recommend these films. <br /> <br />4 stars. brilliant. not for the weak at heart.
B000I5X81K|4.0|I have all of Josh's previous albums, and I enjoy this one as well. If possible, I highly recommend you buy the special edition CD with the two bonus songs and the 35 minute or so DVD on the making of the album. It is worth the extra money for \\"Awake\\" alone, which oddly enough isn't on the standard CD. The second bonus track, \\"Verita\\" is also very good. \\"February Song\\" is a great song Josh performed at the AMA's last week. All of the songs on this album are very long, most well over 4 minutes.  <br />I do wonder how he picks some of these guest artists, though: Ladysmith Black Mambazo? on this album, and Deep Forest on the last album? Who are these people? Personally, I had never heard of any of these artists before I picked up Josh's CD. Why doesn't he get Sting, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Billy Joel, etc. for a duet. I'm sure they would be willing. As you can probably tell, I'm not a big fan of the duets on this album. It's almost like he was looking for some extra songs to fill out the CD, so he decided to do a few duets. Nobody anyone has ever heard of was available, so he called up Ladysmith Black Mambazo.  <br />Anyway, Josh has a great voice. I think anyone would enjoy this CD - you're bound to find at least a few songs that you'll play over and over. I've already purchased tickets to his concert next March in Rochester, NY. I saw him on his last tour as well. Now, I just hope it doesn't take another 3 years for his next album to come out!
0007144350|5.0|Though the print is small for those of us over 40, it's worth it - if not, it would weigh about 10 pounds!  As it is, it's a tome, but worth reading, and re-reading time and again.  It has everything - everything! - that you'll ever hear mentioned - his stories, his novels, his essay's. <br />It would make a great gift for a young writer, as well.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|I think the production is hot.  I think it is splendid.  The staging is a juxtaposition between modern and conventional with the stage hands dressed in black visually moving the props.  Damrau is stunning and articulate.  The 3 maidens and the drei knaben are delightful.  Although a small part, Tynan (Papageena)  was fun and sang beautifully, almost chirping like a bird!  For an 'in your face' misogynistic theme, Roschmann (Pamina) is the one who leads Tamino through fire, then water - ingeniously acted out by the stage crew.  Yes, the woman does have an equally important role in life - well demonstrated and acted by Roschmann.  Hartmann does try too hard in every way.  My HD TV showed spit flying out of his mouth as he emphasized a passage he was singing while at the 3 doors.The ovations at the end are particularly entertaining to watch.  Keenlyside steals the ovation obviously pi55ing off Hartmmann (who II don't think is a very good actor either).  Deservingly,  Damrau deserving the second highest ovation.  The chorus was powerful.  The orchestra performed splendidly.  Although the other characters are not very memorable to me,  this one is a keeper in my collection.  It brought goosebumps, emotions.  I was thoroughly delighted.  This is the one to own.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I realize its not historically accurate--but the fight scenes are great and the glory and the struggles of the characters comes through.  I'm not a Pitt fan, in general, but I really liked him in this.<br /><br />Best line: \\"Before my time is done, I will look down on your corpse and smile.\\"
B000GY729M|5.0|Why don't you people get it? I feel like I'm lecturing to an empty classroom. This was never supposed to be \\"Hot Fuss.\\" There is no sophomore slump. The Killers did exactly what they should have. They made an awesome record. I feel sorry for all of the one-dimensional people out there that can't get past their previous album. As big of nerd as I am, I'm not even that boring. Even I like change and exploration. The Killers are making music for people that can actually think. People who enjoy only force-fed schlock shouldn't even think about purchasing this record. You'll be disappointed that \\"Mr. Brightside\\" didn't rise like a phoenix from your jewel case for a fifth or sixth encore. Give me a break. I feel sorry that The Killers are plagued with whiners and complainers. What happened to loving and appreciating great music? What happened to applauding great talent? Sure \\"Sam's Town\\" is more conceptual than \\"Hot Fuss,\\" but what's wrong with doing something a little different?  I feel like some of their fans are penalizing them for being progressive and forward thinking.  Maybe their last record was too much of a novelty and set somewhat of a trap for them. It put them in a box that they ultimately planned to step out of. Because \\"Sam's Town\\" is a great record and people really should be more open-minded. Wake up kiddies!!! This album is more complex and has more depth than \\"Hot Fuss.\\" Go listen to a boyband if you want manufactured hit after hit. \\"Sam's Town\\" is for people that like good Rock music.
0199267170|5.0|There are many editions of The Bard on the market, some very expensive and others fairly cheap.  Students of Shakespeare at the high school or early university level would be better getting the individual play or plays being studied, rather than the entire corpus of Shakespeare, which is very long (about 1500+ pages including the Sonnets), though for serious lovers of literature and English majors, a compilation such as this is pretty much essential.<br /><br />The Oxford Shakespeare includes all of the main works, the sonnets, and also notes and introductions.  If you need to study an individual play, I would recommend getting the Arden Shakespeare or the Oxford Shakespeare series, which have each individual play accompanied with excellent scholarly notes and decent introductions, but this edition is more useful for reading for pleasure (which is easy to do with Shakespeare) or for private study.<br /><br />This version is fairly accessible and affordable, and worth adding to your collection if you are a fan of Shakespeare.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|After a long wait, Loreena finally released a new stuiod album with NEW pieces.  <br /> <br />I am not a die-hard fan, therefore I can not say it's worth the wait, but I can say, this album doesn't disappoint me like others that recently released such as Enigma, Sarah Brightman and Josh Groban. <br /> <br />In this album, there are something new, the tempo is not as striking as her previous works, it's more smooth ( relateively speaking - slow ).  <br />There are also something familiar - her haunting vocal, excellent quality song selection and great production. Those are very important to make an album successful, you don't just throw or recycle some old songs together and call it a good album regardless how good the singer's voice is. They have to all work together and this album works. <br /> <br />I didn't purchase this on-line as I usually did but got the BN ( Barns & Noble special edition ) with extra track -Raglan Road. That extra dollars I paid is well worth because this is an excellent piece and I feel bad it didn't get included in general release edition. It will be nice if Amazon has some sort of Amazon Exclusive edition from those excellent artists. <br /> <br />
0793518326|5.0|This book contains almost all of the Beatles music, omitting songs from the Anthologies such as Free As a Bird and Real Love. I've found Ain't She Sweet is another omission. Beatles cover songs are included. <br /> <br />People have complained about the text size but it works fine for my 25 year old eyes. Older folks will have to use reading glasses or use copy machine trickery. Or just learn all the songs you want to play before you get too old. <br /> <br />There is a huge amount of transcription so it's of little surprise that there are errors.

0385720920|5.0|Palahniuk uses the novel here as a medical device, delivering a condemning diagnosis and a powerful enema of a treatment for the sick, sad, sorry, state of most of our lives today. Wallowing in dead end jobs and living with no greater hopes for tomorrow than to own a new house or a faster car, these walking dead infest our streets, our lives, and even our minds. How do you charge them awake? Palahniuk molds the most mortifying, grotesque, and morally bankrupt scenarios to draw out the man that lurks within the muppet, the beast that lurks within the man, and draw a razor-edged nihilist balance into his character's lives. <br /> <br />Enjoy, <br />-Ajish
068987474X|1.0|For women who do not understand that a man \\"isn't into her\\" (and vice versa) bc of his inability to call/contact her, well guess what? She probably already knows there isn't wholehearted interest! The audience for this book is self-selecting, and while i'm glad it's helped some women out, I do believe there are multiple reasons a man doesn't pursue. The real question is: so now what? And for some reason, hearing \\"he's not that into you\\" ring in my head like an orchestra of clanging bells slows the whole degrading process down. No thanks Greg.
1559408898|5.0|If anyone cares, there are 3 additional scenes in this version.  The dude who is shot by the robot at the board meeting-there is a gruesome scene of him falling backwards on a table while being shot with blood spraying everywhere.  It's only a few seconds and doesn't add much, but it's a cool scene.  The next scene is only about 3 seconds long.  During the cop chase, there is a close up of Murphy shooting one of the robbers 2x in the leg.  The R version just shows a distant shot of him being hit once.  Murpheys death is a bit longer also.  You see blood pour out of his lost hand, watch his entire left arm get shot off (not just the hand), and he gets shot at a bit longer.  You do feel worse for Murphy after watching this version-especially the scene where blood is pouring from his hand stump.  Overall, maybe 20 seconds of cut material.  I wouldn't spend extra to see it, but if you get the choice, this is the version to get.
B000GG4Y32|4.0|Highly, highly recommended for those who enjoy lush, historical biopics, \\"Reds\\" skillfully and entertainingly combines intelligent, thoughtful political discourse and sweeping romantic drama, resulting in a movie that flies by despite its three hour-plus length.<br /><br />Keep an eye out for how the mundane constantly clashes with the epic during the course of the movie: John Reed and Louise Bryant indulge in lofty political discourse on events that are changing the world as Reed is comically burning dinner in the kitchen; soap opera-ish affairs are entered into and abandoned as governments topple and new ones take their place; a critical meeting to assure the future of the socialist movement in the United States is missed because of a sick baby that needs tending.  This constant and clever juxtaposition of the personal and the epic humanizes the sweeping events on display, reminding us that real people living real lives were at the heart of these world-shaking events, not just academic and political arguments.<br /><br />To enjoy \\"Reds\\", one doesn't have to be a particular proponent of socialism past or present.  I'm certainly not.  You simply need to be someone who enjoys intelligent, involving movies that illuminate the people and events at the heart of notable periods of history.  And \\"Reds\\" is certainly such a movie.  Of course, it helps that John Reed and Louise Bryant are generally portrayed as sympathetic people whose motivations are admirable even if one doesn't agree with their politics.<br /><br />This new, 25th Anniversary Edition DVD of \\"Reds\\" is well worth the modest price.  The crisp yet warm widescreen visuals are almost startlingly clear; the original theatrical intermission break (in a small but nice touch) is preserved at the end of the first disc; and there are very generous extra features that further illuminate the topics covered in the film.<br /><br />In short, this one's a keeper.
B00069FLC2|5.0|This DVD provides us guitar players with a marvelous clinic regardless of the style one embraces. It's a must see for any serious guitarist. One can learn much from watching Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch masterfully play their instruments. Many great close-up shots of both guitarists in action. You don't play guitar? That's okay. You too will enjoy this well-put-together DVD. It contains great music and is a high-quality production. A quite enjoyable DVD to watch and learn from. I highly recommend it.
0393061310|4.0|According to Diamond, four factors are responsible for the historical trajectories of peoples and cultures: 1) availability of developed crops and domesticable animals; 2) the orientation of continental axis to facilitate the spread of agriculture and available knowledge transfers; 3) transfer of knowledge on continents and between continents, and; (as a consquence of 1,2 and 3) 4) population size which induce disease immunity upon the larger and more successful populations.     On the surface this seems like both a seductively simple and old-fashioned deterministic explanation for differences between cultures. But I was pleasantly surprised that Diamond ploughs new ground in his thesis and puts it together in a succinct and cogent package for the reader. My initial prejudice was that Diamond would engage in some kind of right-wing truth politics (the tendancy to draw mathematical-like conclusions to support unpopular ideas with the flimsiest evidence) or else engage in some kind of nobel savage fallacy so often associated with those of the weak-minded left.     In fact Diamond almost wholly rescues the American intellectual tradition, but writing in a common sense fashion in cogent and topical ways keeping his politics on a short leash and sticking wholly to the facts where he knows them, indicating what he does not know and  extemporising only from clearly logical suppositions supported by the archeological, sociological, anthropological and physical data.     He has a great way of posing in simple prose big questions: Why did the Spanish conquer the Incas? Why was it not the case that the Incas develop a culture that could have colonised Europe. It is really owing to the success Europe had -- in geographical advantage -- of the above four factors.    There was never anything in terms of culture or race that neither obviated the succcess of Aboriginals in Australia or North America, nor influence white and Asiatic cultures to be more \\"superior.\\"  It was the luck of the geographic draw.     Diamond backs up his thesis with good and wide-ranging research. He spins a good yarn from time to time and just when you are getting a little tired of animal domestication he switches to the development of written languages. He has a way of making one appreciate momentous events that all of us take for granted. For example the development of written language is a something well studied, but there are few who mention that the development has only taken place in less than a small number or societies: the vast amount of written languages merely leveraged off of these previous developments to piggy-back their own written language. As such there are less than ten societies the developed written languages with no previous exposure to written text. That such developments were easier to travel along the Euro-Asiatic, East-West Axis is a simple, yet far reaching in its implications -- the development of the European and Asiatic cultures that eventually dominated the world.     I would not agree with the review who stated that Diamond needs a better editor. He is concise and covers a lot of ground. Although I was trying very hard to find fault with this book, I found very little. That is not to say that all of this true -- none of it may be true -- but the way he marshalls his thoughts and pleasing presentation in an almost non-polemical way has made me a fan.     There is only one part in the very beginning where Diamond asserts that because Papaun New Guinean tribes must live in adverse circumstances they must be under inherently more selective forces to breed smarter people in evolutionary terms than people living our western cities nowadays. As a scholar or natural selection he must know that the dweller in the cities is also equally suited for their environment as well -- and that is the entire story of natural selection -- adaptation to the environment through natural selection, and that effects people in the city equally as well as those wholive in the jungle.     A good read.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I have been a fan of Josh Groban from the very beginning of his career. As a lover of all types of music I must say he is the only person that can bring me to tears listening to him sing.  His voice is breathtaking.  This new cd showcases this young man's incredible talent not only as a singer, but also as a musician and songwriter. Take my advice, you need to see him in concert.  How many singers can you say actually sound better live than on their cd.
B00020JQGC|5.0|My daughter, who had seen this film and loved it, suggested that we watch it together. I agreed and was very glad I did so, as I really enjoyed this bittersweet film. It is a well-acted, well-directed effort about a free-thinking art history professor, Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts), who in the nineteen fifties, lacking Ivy League credentials, manages, through a twist of fate, to get a berth as a professor at traditional and conservative Wellesley College. It is here that she hopes to find herself instructing the leaders of tomorrow.<br /><br />What she finds, instead, is a group of highly intelligent, young women, who are more interested in marrying the leaders of tomorrow than in being leaders themselves. Ms. Watson succeeds in opening the minds of her students to the possibilities and choices life can offer and learns a little about such possibilities and choices herself. She also finds friendship and romance while at Wellesley College. The film also focuses on four of her students, all of whom are given stellar portrayals by the young actresses playing them.<br /><br />Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Warren (Kirsten Dunst) is the quintessential fifties girl, obsessed with getting her Mrs. before getting her BA. She later discovers that one should be careful for what one wishes. She is also a nasty piece of work who doesn't care what misery for others her poison pen invectives and barbed comments cause. She eventually gets her comeuppance in a way that she never envisioned. Her best friend, Joan Brandwyn (Julia Styles), is a beautiful, highly intelligent, young woman who harbors a secret wish to become a lawyer. Yet, at the same time, she desperately wants to become a wife and mother. Hers is a decision between choices. She ultimately makes a choice that causes Ms. Watson some consternation but with which she is happy. Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a young Jewish miss in a WASP environment who finds herself having short term affairs with her hunky professor and with an older, married man. Connie Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a pleasingly plump, pretty cellist who finds true love, only to find it derailed by the ever evil Betty.<br /><br />Marcia Gay Harden is brilliant in the supporting role of Nancy Abbey, Wellesley College's professor of etiquette and deportment, who, one discovers, has not always followed her own staid advice. Noted British actress, Juliet Stevenson, is outstanding in the small role of Amanda Armstrong, the college nurse and closet lesbian, who is still mourning the loss of her companion of many years. Marian Seldes is perfectly cast as President Jocelyn Carr, whose role at the college seems to be that of keeping the well-heeled alumni and trustees of Wellesley College happy with the status quo. Donna Mitchell turns in a stunning performance as Betty's self-absorbed mother, a woman who is a slave to the expected and puts appearances before her daughter's happiness. Julia Roberts is luminous as the role of Katherine Watson, infusing it with an intelligence and natural warmth that radiates off the screen. Though she has a little bit too contemporary an edge, she still manages to carry the day in the role of the forward thinking professor with the Mona Lisa smile.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful, highly enjoyable film in which the social mores and style of the nineteen fifties are well depicted.older, married man.

B000ASDFJU|2.0|Okay, i absolutely love this show with all my heart..but the same thing happened to me when i bought this set. i bought it from best buy and had to return it 3 times before it actually worked. on the first 2 sets, the discs were all scratched and alot of the episodes couldnt play. Also, the extras just seem extremely disappointing. You would think you get something fabulous for $200. I should have just stuck with the individual seasons i had sold to buy this :(
B000HEWEEE|4.0|\\"The Lake House\\" is one of those romantic movies that require such a suspension of disbelief that it might as well be catalogued in the fantasy, sci fi or superhero collections of your local video store.  This is due to the central fact that, since all romances require an apparently insurmountable obstacle for the lovers to overcome, Lake House complies by having the lovers, Keanu Reeves and a never lovelier Sandra Bullock, separated in time and space by two years.<br /><br />Taking a page out of Steven King's playbook, whereby odd things are never explained ...they just ARE...a mailbox becomes the lovers' unusual conduit to one another as they send missives across time and experience the odd sensation of standing in the EXACT same spot in the three physical dimensions, but two years apart in the all-important fourth.  Their task is to somehow make their love last until they can figure out a way to get not only in the same time and place physically, but emotionally as well.  It is to the two stars' credit that they are, each in his or her own way, engaging enough that the viewer stops asking \\"How is this happening?\\" and instead gets caught up in the quest for a resolution.<br /><br />The rest of the film is standard boy-meets-girl fare with no surprises.  Christopher Plummer, lately experiencing something of a career renaissance, gives an outstanding but pointless performance as Reeves' estranged father, in a subplot that adds little to the film and actually distracts from the main story, and the \\"crisis\\" at the end is unfortunately telegraphed 2/3 of the way through the film, so that when it actually transpires it comes across as a cheesy and unnecessary tug at the audience's heartstrings.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a real feel-good movie.  No important themes are explored, no great issues are resolved, and no insightful messages linger with the audience as the credits roll.  Nonetheless, this is a movie worth seeing.  Yes, the film's central plot device calls for a major league suspension of disbelief...but then so does the notion of true love itself.  Personally, I prefer to believe in both.ot device calls for a major league suspension of disbelief...but then so does the notion of true love itself.  Personally, I prefer to believe in both.  <br />
0596009208|5.0|What a fun and interesting book.  Reading it, I feel like I re-learned Java and my approach to programming.  I recommend it for all levels. I look forward to more books from Kathy and Bert.<br /><br />BTW, look at \\"Head First Design Patterns\\".  Same people.  I thought I was a good developer before I read that one.  Many of the patterns have been applied easily in my current projects.<br /><br />Anything that Kathy and Bert write is gold in my book.
0307237699|5.0|What surprised me most about this book is that it is exactly that--a book, not just a self-serving political bio sent out at the start of a campaign. Certainly, it is that as well, and I am not so naive as to think the timing of its release is coincidence, but it is more than that. Barack Obama has proven himself to be an able politican, carefully navigating the waters between the left and right, creating consensus where he can. But he is perhaps a better author than he is a politician, with a clear, flowing style that carries the reader through his pages almost effortlessly. And when is the last time that could be said of a political bio?
B000EHRVP6|3.0|The movie was like this: first part was sex and drugs, second part was a nice little mystery, and the final part was were all the gore came in. I didnt find the movie very gory, so I don't know what all the hype about the movie is. Its too bad they have to make a sequel for this movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently finished this series that my daughter had told me so much about.  Now I know why she said that she cried when Firefly ended.  I'm completely confounded at why this series was cancelled!  <br /> <br />The characters in this show have depth and the relationships are complex.  The actors are very well-cast.  Every actor cast in the crew does an incredible job.  The most compelling thing about Firefly is that it transports you to this very believable universe that the crew inhabits.     <br /> <br />I recommend this series for anyone: not just Sci-Fi fans (which I am not).  Be sure to have your choice of comfort medicine handy for the last episode:  You'll be ticked-off when it ends and you realize that there are no more Firefly episodes to watch!
B000089RW0|3.0|The movie sucked. The ending made me think they would have a sequel, but thank god they didnt do that. The only thing that saved the movie from me throwing it away, was the speical features. It explained more of the movie and made me go oh, thats what happened. I hope they really dont make a sequel to this and im sorry to any fans of this movie who got excited by the my title.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I got this album for Christmas when I was 15 and I thought it was some weird s---. Three or four listens later I was hooked forever. I was kinda anti-SP for a while, for reasons lost to history, and allowed the album (it was on cassette tape) to go missing. I just purchased it again on CD; possibly ridiculous because I have half the songs downloaded anyway. But this will go down in history (judging by the current music scene) as one of the last rock ALBUMS to be amazing start to finish. Certainly Siamese Dream is compelling enough to make me take a crowbar to my wallet, over a decade after I first listened to it. <br /> <br />Enough of this \\"I\\" stuff. Corgan's guitar playing was never better than on this album. The catchy riffs are too many to count. Lyrics are kinda interesting too, and I never was in the \\"Corgan's voice sucks\\" camp; it's just androgynous, folks. Never liked his solos a heckuva lot (always thought of him as a songwriter first, to be honest) but \\"Geek USA's\\" is stunning, and a couple others aren't bad. Can't forget Chamberlin is a superb, funky drummer, other than Dave Grohl the best of his era. Overall ... well, it's just a rock classic.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I heard it twice over while driving. The vocalist needs to go. I've loved the man enough but the writing on the wall is that he screws up the most interesting of punch guitar riffs with his weird twilight vocals. AND I really don't see how I can like him any longer.<br /><br />I mean, take a song called Eternity by Stratovarius for instance. Have you seen how the vocalist builds it up and then tears it apart from there on? Or take another song by them, Papillon. Men, you have to hear that song to know that it actually exists. By no means is Stratovarius better than D.T but the vocalist is a fine example of what D.T needs. Root Of All Evil - could have been the best song D.T did.<br /><br />I have loved D.T long enough to know that I can have a say in what I think is right or wrong about them. The guitars on Octavarium are larger than life. I have said enough. Apologies in advance to whosoever thinks I'm wrong.<br /><br />P.S - Train Of Thought/Scenes were my two favorite DT albums. Home is my favorite headbanger of all time.
B000GTLQXU|3.0|Expectations for this mimeographic motion picture must remain low. The real star is the \\"rogue wave\\" (gosh, to repress a smirk hearing that explanation stagger like an inebriated dwarf from the lips of \\"Detective Pembleton\\" Andre Braugher is truly an arduous task) and the systematic dismantling of the cast. Viewers will be reminded of the various stars' creative missteps; Kurt Russell fans will conjure images of \\"Captain Ron\\" and \\"Breakdown\\", not \\"Backdraft\\" and \\"Escape from New York\\", while Richard Dreyfuss fans will think about \\"The Crew\\" and \\"Silent Fall\\" in lieu of \\"Jaws\\" and \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\". My friends and I literally concocted scorecards for this flick, placing wagers on the characters' one-dimensional lives. Stacey Ferguson, Freddy Rodriguez, and Kevin Dillon earn disaster movie accolades for ascertaining the signatures on their checks were legit and then shrieking/mugging/cussing on cue upon the precipices of their respective demises. Heck, Miss Black Eyed Pea gets to sing a song, heave a sigh, and hug the captain AND THAT'S IT, FOLKS!!! Take the money and run... <br /> <br />However, the movie is not bad. It is not great but it is grand in its gesture to give the audience what it wants: a throwback to the good ol' stupid days of the genre thirty years ago. For me, and doubtlessly for many others, that's sufficient, and we are thankful. <br /> <br />Words to the wise: Don't rent this movie from Blockbuster or Hollywood. Get it for $1 from those new-fangled machines in the grocery store, if your local supermarket has one of them. Hey, if the characters in \\"Poseidon\\" aren't going to display any pragmatism, at least YOU can. <br /> <br />By the by, this movie was a critical and financial failure, so it \\"died\\". Ironic that, in the year of its release, 3 Poseidon vets should also die: Shelley Winters (Mrs. Rosen from the original), Red Buttons (who we all expected to survive the original, which he did, being a completely illogical choice of survivor in the stead of the younger and more athletic Gene Hackman---Richard Dreyfuss fulfills the same role in the re-make), and Jack Warden, who was BLIND in \\"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\\" and STILL lived through the experience (with his career intact). EERIE....
B000HEWEJO|4.0|Paramount has done a great job remastering this beloved classic. However, the audio pops that other customers have noticed have got to be fixed! They are very loud and they take you out of the film because they sound \\"digital\\" and not part of the original soundtrack. It wouldn't take Paramount much time nor money to fix these problems. And it should be done because 1. This is one of the most loved films ever made and 2. Customers are tired of repurchasing this title every few years because each one has a major flaw.
0375703861|3.0|The reviews here are very interesting and I must confess that I wrestled mightily with my own final analysis. Let's get the obvious out of the way, Ms. Smith has a compelling, original voice as a social commentator but her characters do not! The genre is English satire and while the author has oodles of talent in the area of biting satire, she also falls into the trap of peopling her first novel with caracitures not real flesh and blood individuals (isn't this ironic considering it's largely a book about bias in race relations?) The novel lacks any semblance of character development- so we end up not giving a hoot about any of the protagonists. They are simple set pieces for Ms. Smith's parodies and writerly talents. As mentioned in several other reviews, her dialogue is very weak and the plot contrived. Having said that, Ms. Smith provides wonderful observations on just about any subject and displays an assured hand with language. I would like to read one day a contemporary English novel where the British class system is not the main topic.
1582701709|5.0|Rhonda Bryne's \\"THE SECRET\\" is one of the most inspiring, life enhancing work I have ever come across, particularly because of how it is delivered, in a palatable manner that anyone can understand and relate to.<br /><br />What I love most about this work is its impact in both scope and delivery. You learn HOW to focus, how to change your mental and verbal script to create the life you truly prefer, as well as how to go about manifesting in a clear and positive manner.<br /><br />While I am very familiar with what is shared about the manifestation process, and can personally attest to its accuracy from my own life, it is also the way the material is presented that is a breath of fresh air which I believe anyone from any culture or background can find joy and delight as they are awakened to what CAN happen when you combine your thoughts, words, feelings, passion, focus, action and trust allowing the universe to bring about what you TRULY would love in your life.<br /><br />If you really have the desire to turn your life around, I wholeheartedly recommend BOTH this book, as well as watching the movie. Both are entirely inspiring, pure, positive, and I believe life changing for anyone.<br /><br />Truly deserves 100 stars and a deep THANK YOU for all you are doing to help humanity!<br /><br />Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of If God Hears Me I Want an Answer! and Stop Being the String Along
B000ILYYJE|5.0|With this boxset which you can easily get online for 100 some dollars it is worth every penny. Not only does it include the old 99masters but it also has a new 5.1 mix on the dvds as well as a non 5.1. There are also bonus songs which range from good to okay as well as videos on each disk. Now some of the other reviews said the sounds isint that good but let me tell you the sound is awesome. All of the albums have been remixed and the sound is much more spaced out...now you hear things that were not even audible or present in the old mixes. It really lets you re-experience the music again with amazing quality. If you are a doors fan its a must buy but if you are just getting into the music maybe try the greatest hits before.
B000J10EQU|2.0|I was generally disappointed in the movie Superman Returns.  It seemed like the ingredients were there, they just never jelled.  Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth both seemed way too young to have a backstory, and literally zero chemistry together.  There were serious lapses in the logic of the script as well.  Superman and Clark Kent both disappeared five years ago, and they both show up again on the same day with no one noticing?  And not only that, but after this long absence, Clark seems to just waltz into his old job at they Daily Planet as if nothing had happened?  I did like the rescue scene with the jet, however, in both these and other FX scenes, Superman's physique seemed to change to one much bigger.  In the scene in the hospital, where they took off Superman's shirt, his chest didn't look all that big.  This was as disconcerting as the animated flying sequences in the original Kirk Alyn serials.  Routh's costume had a strange rubbery look to it, and it was obvious they were aping the more beleagured Spiderman. I constantly felt like I wasn't watching a new Superman movie as much as a remake of a Christopher Reeve one.  Surely Superman has more villains than just Lex Luthor and his grand real estate schemes!  They even had the same John Williams score, and Marlon Brando's droning monotone.  I always thought that the first Reeve's movie toed the line of bad taste with that Marlon Brandon bit of monologue about giving us his only son in pseudo-Biblical language.  Superman Returns didn't just toe the line but stomped all over it.    On the plus side I did like the Art Deco look, and the casting of both Perry White (Frank Langella) and Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington).  Although I would have prefered Brendon Frasier as Superman, he probably couldn't make as many sequels as Routh.  Like Batman Returns, I'm looking foreward to the sequel to see how they do without having to reintroduce the characters all over again.    Whatever happened to super heroes with that certain joie de vivre?
0740748475|5.0|Bill Watterson is a genius. For a tad over a decade Watterson gave us a gift by sharing with us the life of a six year old boy, Calvin, and Hobbes, his (stuffed) tiger and best friend. Calvin is a rambunctious and mischievous child with an over-active imagination and a youthful innocence regarding life's complexities. He, and only he, sees his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, as a living, breathing companion and the reader shares this perspective the majority of the time. Hobbes' demeanor is more suave than his young partner in crime. Their relationship is both touching for its warmth and hilarious for its ebullient confrontations. Their emotional responses and reactions to their life's encounters are so extreme and over-the-top that the reader cannot remain disconnected from the humor. And the themes Watterson weaves throughout are easy to relate to. It's life with a humorous twist and a quirky perspective.    Watterson's talent was two pronged. His writing was hilarious, clever, insightful and sometimes poignant. His drawings and paintings were art that could make you laugh until you had tears rolling down your cheeks. Some cartoonists are one dimensional. Watterson was the whole package. And as far as packages go, this collection is the whole shebang. It contains every strip that he wrote, beautifully presented in three hard-covered volumes in a sturdy slipcase. The paper stock is high quality and the printing is crisp. Watterson's work ethic is evident in 'The Complete Calvin and Hobbes'. Over ten years, the strip never lost its spark. Never was it left to coast on the support of a dedicated fan base or run past its use-by date and die with a whimper. When Watterson ceased producing Calvin and Hobbes, the strip was appearing in thousands of papers and as far afield as the other side of the world. For those new to the world of comics, I cannot offer a better recommendation than the world of Calvin and Hobbes. As an established fan, I already own a lot of Calvin and Hobbesbooks. I view this set as a top-shelf item, something to be treasured and read with care. The rest of my collection I intend for rigorous daily use and to share with my children. My second child is on the way. My first was a son... I named him Calvin!

0743298020|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is exceptionally well written, sentence by sentence. Within its pages are scattered gemstones of delectable prose.  It will pull you into a foggy spookiness; it will delight you with its words. It will confound you with its characters at times, but the pages will float away and become velvet in your hands, a wellworn fabric both musty and sparkling. Truly one of the best contemporary books I've read in a long time. Many kudos to the author.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|I'm sorry, for the great job that was done on special effects and the ravaged story that was originally told in the Hellblazer comic book series, this movie could have still been better if not for the completely awkward and based solely on \\"what Hollywood wanted\\" casting.  Keanu Reeves has done some decent work in a few of the movies I've seen, but he was not the right guy for the part of John Constantine, nor was Shia Lebeouf the right guy for the part of Chaz Kramer.<br /><br />The character of John Constantine, in the comics, is a weathered englishman with a horrible smoking habit who incurs the wrath of heaven, hell and earth alike with his efforts to protect the planet and in most cases, himself.  In my humble opinion, the right guy for this movie would likely have been James Marsters, Spike from the Buffy TV Series.  The character of Chaz, again, in the comics, is an old friend of Johns that has been through the wars with him, and most of the time not without putting up a fight of his own not to be involved.  So having this young kid hanging on the coattails of the Hellblazer and wanting to learn the tricks of the trade was simply horrifying to the fans of the comic series.<br /><br />The movie itself was nicely done, Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton were both great in this as were all the peripheral people who helped make the movie an enjoyable is not somewhat tedious (for comic fans hoping for something closer to the comic) watch.<br /><br />And please don't misunderstand, I'm not a Keanu hater, nor do I dislike Shia, his Greatest Game Ever Played was a great movie, it's just here, in this particular instance, I think that Hollywood should have tried a little harder to keep to the formula that made the comic such a success and they could only have done that with a slightly different cast.<br /><br />If you see it, you'll enjoy it, the flaws are pretty apparent, but it still rates a watch, although I have yet to see it a second time.
B000K7VHH8|5.0|Sean Connery is Robert MacDougal, art thief extraordinaire. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Virginia Baker, insurance investigator out to get her man. It is always good to see Sean Connery but he and Zeta-Jones have very little to no chemistry as a team if that was what they were intended to be in a very tired plot line. The film starts off well but their chemistry or relationship is rather strange if one even cares about that aspect. Caper films such as this have been done much better. The preparation scenes for the caper are a bore and look pretty unprofessional for characters who are supposed to be in this line of work. What this film needed was a good director and a good editor as well. The film has a few good scenes thanks to Connery, but the film never reaches its potential. Norman Garwood's Production Designs help a bit while Christopher Young's score is perfunctory. In truth this is a very tired looking production as is Connery's expression throughout.
B00000342V|5.0|Just Listen and keep an open mind. The bass lines seem to be the crux of Mr. Mayfields writing. It's true...anybody who heard these songs back in the 70's will be astounded by the timiliness of the songs...We can deal with Rockets and Planes but reality...what does it mean..... <br />Goes to show that Mr. Mayfield was right on and his words ring true even today.
0316776963|5.0|Suffice it to say that Sedaris is not to everyone's taste. However, you would have to be pretty humorless not to appreciate his unique perspective on subjects as diverse as his family and his experiences as a not-so-innocent abroad in France who initially has no interest in learning the language--then six years into his French experience, finally takes on the mother tongue with all he has--which he is quick to admit isn't much.    A lot of fun, and if you're having a tough personal time, Sedaris will show you how much better off you are than he is! (But really, the man's a best-seller, so he can't be too bad!)    If your humor goes a little left of center, this is a good read for you.

B0009VRHLK|5.0|There are a few things that need to be understood about this movie. The first is that this not a typical movie in any sense. It's a kind of a road movie, but like all the best road movies the journey serves a symbolic as well as a narrative sense. The closest precursor to this film I can think of is Monte Hellman's \\"Two Lane Blacktop,\\" a film that drew similar derision 35 years ago but has gone on to become a kind of classic within film appreciation circles. Gallo's film takes some of the basic ideas about a road journey as existentialist metaphor from the earlier film and develops and tweaks them in interesting ways, resulting in one of the more ambitious and rewarding American films of recent years.[...]    So try to look beyond your initial reactions and take the movie on its own terms. One final note - Chloe Sevigny does not deserve the outrage that some of the guardians of public decency have levelled against her. She was and remains a fine actress, and while I cannot attest to her personal character, there is no reason to assume that her participation in this movie necessarily reveals her to be an immoral person. Remember, she and Gallo have been intimate in the past, so she doesn't do anything in this movie that she hasn't done before - while many other actresses routinely have very steamy scenes with actors they have never had a relationship with! Watch this movie carefully first, and reserve your judgments for later. When you do, you might just discover a bold and exciting experiment in American film.
0790737345|5.0|I watch movies, read books and listen to music for the sheer joy of doing it.  I don't consider myself any kind of expert on what any particular film was based on, so learning this movie was based on a more poetic german masterpiece only meant that I had to add another movie to the list of movies I'd like to see.<br /><br />But this movie, this movie was a classic in it's own right.  What woman doesn't dream of an angel falling so deeply in love with her that the angel would forego even heaven to be by her side, hell, to ask it even more honestly, what woman doesn't dream of anyone falling in love with them enough to give up something they have and/or love?  I caught this movie by mistake one day, buying a center channel speaker for my home theatre system the guy at the store started this movie and I was hooked from the first compelling scenes with the little girl and her mother.  I paid full price for an open item in order to take this movie home and watch it.  My money has rarely been spent better.<br /><br />The moods were well played and well set by the director, the casting was spot on and the music did what music should do in movies, it made the scenes better.  Anyone who sees this movie will feel the hot tempo of Paula Cole's \\"Feelin' Love\\" while Seth (Nicolas Cage) sits outside the bathroom where Maggie (Meg Ryan) is bathing while thinking his name and immediately want to find themselves in a like situation, it's impossible not to.  The Googoo Dolls and Sarah McLachlan songs are also extremely well placed but my favorite song was actually the U2 offering \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\".<br /><br />Although the line Maggie says to Seth is beautiful and moving, I will say that the last line Seth says to Cassiel comes off a little too dramatic and slightly forced, but it doesn't in any way deter from the sheer beauty of this movie.<br /><br />If you do see it, please, do yourself the favor of trying not to have any distractions and open yourself up to the poignancy of the movie in each scene and as a whole, it's really a worthwhile watch and more, a worthwhile feel.poignancy of the movie in each scene and as a whole, it's really a worthwhile watch and more, a worthwhile feel.
0307237699|4.0|In the chapter on opportunity Obama writes, \\"In fact, according to David, just finding American born engineers, whatever their race, was getting harder - which was why every company in Silicon Valley had come to rely heavily on foreign students.\\"  Lately, high-tech employers had a new set of worries: Since 9/11 a lot of foreign students were having second thoughts about studying in the States due to the difficulties in obtaining visas. Top-notch engineers or software designers didn't need to come to Silicon Valley anymore to find work or get financing for a start-up.  High-tech firms were setting up operations in India and China at a rapid pace, and venture funds were now global; they would just as readily invest in Mumbai or Shanghai as in California.  And over the long term, David explained, that could spell trouble for the U.S. economy.  \\"We'll be able to keep attracting talent,\\" he said, \\"because we're so well branded.  But for the start-ups, some of the less established companies, the next Google, who knows?  I just hope somebody in Washington understands how competitive things have become. Our dominance isn't inevitable.\\" <br /> <br />If Obama has bought into the Silicon Valley point of view regarding a so-called lack of American-born software engineers then he isn't as in-touch as he thinks he is with American workers.  American students are not signing up for Computer Engineering or Computer Science or Information Systems in the numbers they once were because wages are stagnating, openings are fewer and fewer, the openings that are available require an extremely narrow skills focus (unless you happen to be Asian), employers repeatedly fire the American - but not before the American worker is forced to train the foreign-born worker, jobs that are available are without benefits (thanks to all those H-1B workers) and short-term.  If Obama thinks that temporary jobs are the exception and not the norm, he hasn't researched the high-tech job market recently. One thing that makes me madder than a hornet is to hear a politician saying, \\"Re-train\\".  They don't have a clue.

B00005JPC7|4.0|Harold Crick (Ferrell) is an IRS agent who sees numbers everywhere in his daily life.  He leads a boring life, and is somewhat content with it.  Then, one day, he begins to hear a voice narrating his life.  The voice does not belong to God, but to author Kay Eiffel (Thompson).  She does not write books that end well for the protagonist, and one day Harold's voice tells him that he is going to die soon.  He seeks out help from a literary professor (Hoffman), who does not entirely believe him.  Meanwhile, Harold is auditing Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), an banker who he quickly falls for.  Now, he has something to live for, and solving the problem of the voice and its prediction becomes extra important. <br /> <br />Will Ferrell is great as Harold.  He is a likeable everyman.  His humor is never over the top, and he handles the drama quite well.  He is the glue that holds this movie together, and deserves recognition for the role.  The supporting cast is good, never taking away from the focus of the film.  The story itself is an interesting idea, but perhaps the ending was a bit of a cop-out.  It did not feel right to me, but that is a small quibble for an otherwise enjoyable film. <br />
B000J10ERO|3.0|Superman has returned, but I'm not sure he's here to save the day. While the film is visually stunning (and for that, it's certainly at least worth a rental), it lacks a lot in plot and follow through.<br /><br />QUICK SYNOPSIS: Superman returns after having been gone for 5 years(once again, crashing into his mother's farm fields in a meteorite, only this time he's a full grown man instead of a baby). The world has moved on without him. Even the love of his life, Lois Lane, has moved on with someone else. However, it is soon obvious to Superman that the world is in desperate need of a hero, especially after the power hungry lunatic Lex Luther is released from prison and takes up his old \\"world domination\\" driven ways.<br /><br />I had many issues with this film, even though I desperately wanted to love it. SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />One of my main concerns was with one of the major plotlines of the story, and that was the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane. The director of \\"Superman Returns\\" explained that he didn't want to diminish anything that the past Superman films have accomplished. He wanted the memory of the past films to be alive and well, so he decided to tell a return story. Superman left...and then came back. However, if that was the case...how come Lois Lane has no idea that Superman is really Clark Kent? Lois was well aware of this fact in the past films...so why not in this one? She has a child with Superman, how can she not know that the man in glasses she sees everyday at work, and treats with a casual indifference, is the father of her child?<br /><br />There was also a lot to be desired in the Lex Luthor plotline. He is supposed to be a supervillian, but the ending of this film is a little lame and disappointing. I was also disappointed that Superman never actually fights anyone! He's Superman, for goodness sake, can't he throw a punch at *someone*! A bad guy, perhaps?<br /><br />And finally, (and this is a very *minor* thing, but me being the animal lover I am, it was very disturbing), there is a small scene in the movie in which Lex Luthor returns home after a long journey to discover that one of his Chihuahuas (which he inherited from a rich old lady on her death bed) has eaten the other Chihuahua. It lay on the floor and chewed on a rib bone amid a pile of dog fur. It was a disturbing visual on so many levels, and it immediately turned me off of the movie. I realize that it was meant to illustrate what a cold-hearted villian Lex Luthor is, but I just don't feel it was necessary.<br /><br />Having said all that, I still think the movie is worth seeing at least once. There are a lot of cool action sequences, and setting and cinematography are incredible. Kate Bosworth was a bit of a poor fit for Lois Lane. Her character came off as a super-bitch to Superman. The rest of the cast were well suited to their characters.<br /><br />If you want to see any kind of cool special features, then you'll need to purchase the 2 disc special edition of this film. The single disc edition has NO special features on it at all. Just the film and a scene selection option.<br /><br />All in all, it's worth a rental at least. I'd rent it first to see if you like it before you decide to purchase it.ing, but me being the animal lover I am, it was very disturbing), there is a small scene in the movie in which Lex Luthor returns home after a long journey to discover that one of his Chihuahuas (which he inherited from a rich old lady on her death bed) has eaten the other Chihuahua.

B000JK8OYU|2.0|As a lifelong Beatles fan---and a professional musician, I must ask really, just what IS all the hubbub about another okey-dokey Beatles assemblage released just in time to drag in another few million pounds and dollars before the Christmas season? As a novelty I suppose it's fine but as a significant addition to their body of work it is a definite disappointment. Over the years I've heard much more innovative compilations on bootleg tapes. <br />Yes, the clarity and sharpness of the recordings is likely the best yet, but why shouldn't it be? The average p.c. can make recordings superior to state-of-the-art equipment in the Beatles' time. We should only expect modern sound recording and playback technology to have improved dramatically. <br />As to some of the \\"amazing\\" musical mixes I've been hearing the critics gush over, Giles and George are really not doing anything here that any reasonably skilled club D.J. doesn't do every night that they work. <br />I also have to wonder about some of the selections chosen for the compilation. GET BACK is little more than very standard, if not outright 12-bar pedestrian fare easily handled by the neighborhood garage band. The best thing about the song was never the Beatles; it was Billy Preston's rolling keyboard solo(s). <br />SOMETHING, I AM THE WALRUS, ELEANOR RIGBY and several others are nothing new, or at least not very new, with a bit of mildly interesting tweaking but certainly not groundbreaking or interesting beyond an initial listen. <br />Other than selling scads of tickets to pony-tailed baby boomers with too much cash and time on their hands, I can't find any truly redeeming purpose for this collection. <br />Dig through your old vinyl records and stick with STARS ON 45.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I remember being about 5 or 6 years old when I saw my first Star Wars movie in the early 1980s.  I also remember running to the back of the theater screaming when Darth Vader appeared on the screen.  Mother had to come get me as I was trying to hide behind a poor couple's seats.<br /><br />Now I am 30 years old and had the chance to see the digital re-makes and upgrades that George Lucas did over the years, plus his legendary prequels over that same time.  The news about Lucas Films digitizing everything (including the first movies) around the time Episode I was released only intensified the fervor of Star Wars mania some 20 years later.<br /><br />Now that I am a respectable and employed adult, I decided to drop my cash on this fine trilogy as I wanted the first movies for my home set.  I knew what I was getting into: these are not the original releases.  For me, I prefer that, because watching 1970s and 80s technology is not as appealing to me as 2000's technology.  And besides, these movies now tell a better story as a result of George Lucas' upgrades.<br /><br />So let me review the darn package after all that now!<br /><br />For about $50, you get three movies and a bonus disc.  That means each disc will cost you a little more than $12 each, together.<br /><br />If you are wondering if the bonus disc is worth $12, I would give an emphatic Yes.  The disc chronicles the making of the movie and all the side business, the science of creating the movie, and actors'/directors'/etc. viewpoints on the whole thing.  It lasts over 240 minutes, and every drop of information will rile even the slightest Star Wars fans.<br /><br />Next, on the question of digitization, the three films (Episodes 4 - 6) not only had a slick digital transfer (making them compatible with today's machinery and offering the capability to excel over yesteryear), but they revamped certain scenes that could have used the facelift.<br /><br />For example, now the speeder coming into the Mos Eisley spaceport doesn't look like it was a 1977 carousel.  It actually looks futuristic in its movement.  Also, they replaced Anikan Skywalker with Hayden Christensen instead of the original fellow when his ghost looks upon Luke at the end of Return of the Jedi.  (That was the best addition/change, I think.)<br /><br />I like action/adventure movies, so the digital upgrades Lucas did are welcomed by me.  I know there are purists out there, but they tend to follow a religion more than the excitement of the movie.  (Reminds me of people who do not like the Designated Hitter in baseball, now that I think about it.  But I digress.)<br /><br />To close, I recommend the purchase of this trilogy if you were in my situation: you didn't have any of these movies.  And I mean the digitized versions.  Get them.  The old ones are collectibles, but if you want a completed collection to show your kids, this trilogy fills the gaps, and the bonus disc is worth it as well.  Also, if you can beat $12 per disc individually to complete your collection, I'd say go that route instead, though you may have to forego the bonus disc.aceport doesn't look like it was a 1977 carousel.

076790382X|5.0|I bought this book while browing because (1) I had read and loved In a Sunburned Country, and (2) because I spent the first 18 years of my life as an American living overseas.  I moved permanently back to the U.S. several months ago, and I was interested to see another American's perspectives on being here. <br /> <br />The book was highly entertaining.  Many of Bryson's observations made me laugh out loud.  My parents also enjoyed the book.  Despite the fact that Bryson's topics were a little more trite than what I had been expecting, I thoroughly enjoyed his hilarious style of writing.  I would definitely recommend this book, and I plan on reading more of Bryson's books in the future.

B000H0MKGK|2.0|I've been a Mayer fan for a long time and probably have all his studio CDs - Room for Squares, Heavier Things, Inside Wants Out.  And then I got Try!.  To me, Continuum is a disappointment for folks like me who preferred Mayer to be more rock/pop than blues.  I detected his inkling to explore other musical forms when he 1st made a guest recording on Herbie Hancock's Possibilities.  Then he ventured into Blues in Try!  But if you really want to hear vintage Mayer, all you need is to start from the 1st track from Room for Squares and you'll be sold to buy his second CD Heavier Things.   I like him better when he had raw energy on Back to You in Inside Wants Out, his earnesty in Victoria on the same album than all the tracks on Continuum put together.  I'll still buy his albums and may attend his concert if he's ever playing in this part of the world, but like all great acts (Radiohead, Michael Jackson, etc) who had strong, progressive and rythmic sounds in their first couple of albums, I worry Mayer may indulge into self-importance for the sake of sophistication and lose most of his fans' traction in the end.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|This is a great CD.  Their voices blend so beautifully, though at times Carlos tries to sing louder than everyone else, which is ok as his voice is just breathtaking.  the only problem i have with it is i wish more songs were in english.  Somewhere takes you \\"out there\\" - just magnificent
B00005JPCY|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. I always love Denzel in what ever he is playing because he is such a great actor but wait until jim caviezel enters the film. wow. He's really good too!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Was I skeptical?  No doubt.  But I was interested, primarily because of the people involved - namely Sir George and Giles Martin.  Also, the fact that they were releasing a 5.1 DVD Audio version intrigued me. <br /> <br />So, the result?  Well, there is some mish-mosh that is pretty disorienting, but there are also some interesting mixes that point out what a good remix/remaster would do for the Beatles' catalog (will that EVER happen?). <br /> <br />At any rate, I think the 5.1 version is something special for true Beatles fans.  To hear these revisions is exhilerating if sometimes disorienting.  In fact, the opening is VERY disorienting.  One hears the wildlife sounds from Across the Universe (I think)and then comes Because, which we've already heard in this vocals-only form, but which now disobeys meter to cast the lines out in a very disconnected fashion.  I actually thought my DVD player was messing up.  That's only the beginning.  Get Back begins with the opening chord to A Hard Day's Night, then abruptly moves into the drum and guitar solo from The End, which finally segues into Get Back, albeit with extra drums. <br /> <br />I know they'll be endless commentary (and controversy) about tampering with the Beatles' songs in this manner.  I just kept a positive attitude and enjoyed the aural soundscape.  Only occasionally did it turn into a cacaphony, and even then I was challenged by identifying which track each of the different sounds originally came from.  Some sounds are easy to identify, some are really difficult.  Like the guessing game we played with the video for Free As A Bird, it can be fun, exasperating and certainly distracting. <br /> <br />My suggestion to any Beatle fan is to buy this, but absolutely buy the version with the 5.1 DVD Audio disc.  The swirl of sound is so much more effective and aurally fun, and it's just easier to separate and identify all the disparate sounds. <br /> <br />There are some high points and low points worth mentioning.   <br /> <br />First the wonderful separation on the songs.  This is the first time I've heard the high octane twin-guitar attack on Revolution with the guitars separated out between the channels.  WOW!  Or how about the separation of bass and rhythm guitar on Back In The U.S.S.R?  That song has always been a mess of a mix, but this brings out every instrument clear as a bell.  The downside of both of those mixes, however, is the fact that both are edited; we don't get the complete version of either song. <br /> <br />Many of the songs receive serious edits, and I hate to hear that, but, on the other hand, we get to hear more songs with this treatment.  I Am The Walrus is a real aural treat, and Strawberry Fields gets my vote as best edit.  It's a brilliant job of fusing a demo tape, an early take and (part of) the finished master into a seamless whole that actually stands as a \\"song\\".  Also the Within Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows pastiche is VERY interesting, particlulary how it segues into Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.  Bizarre, yes.  Disorienting?  Yes.  Fascinating?  You Bet!!! <br /> <br />If you are a skeptical Beatles fan, I don't blame you.  We've had much to be skeptical about regarding the way the Beatles' catalog has been treated.  But my advise is overcome your skepticism and give yourself a treat.  There's not much Beatles music that is available in 5.1 (none, in fact, unless you put on your Yellow Submaring DVD and just listin to the music.  I've actually done that, but the long passages of time without music and various sound effects that play as part of the soundtrack make it a tough audio-only experience).  So, here you have a chance to receive a guided tour through some of the the Beatles' multi-track tapes, lovingly and well-meaningly put together by the guy that committed all those sounds to tape all those years ago.  And he's smart enough to know his 80 year old ears needed help, so he brought in his son, which was obviously a good choice. <br /> <br />Ah, go on, treat yourself.  It will, for a while, take your mind off the fact that we will pass another holiday season without the loving remastering that is due the Beatles entire catalog.  Happy Christmas.

B000GRUS22|3.0|Just a quick review to concurr with ROCKET's review somewhere above...  I listenend to this album for the first time in my car on a long road trip.  Was really dissapointed, thought it alittle shallow in sound, etc.  I then got home and put it on a decent soundsystem and it was almost like listening to a different album.  There is a lot of subtle mixing here that really lifts the whole thing.  Last track is a bit cheesy though...
B00005JPCD|3.0|Well, I know the film will be far more popular than this review, but I try to call them as they are. The film starts out with narration, but does not end with narration - which makes you wonder how well thought out the story was and how much went on the cutting room floor - so to speak. Memphis has the golden throat of Elvis and his wife Norma Jean has the buxom penguin chest of Marilyn Monroe, replete with \\"mole\\" marking on her shoulder.<br /><br />The couple breaks into song, frequently professing their love for one another. Unlike other 3D animation hits like \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"Shrek,\\" this story does not have original songs written for the story - instead they re-do popular hits... and the lyrics are frankly not appropriate for children. Here are some snippets:<br /><br />Kiss:<br /><br />You don't have to be beautiful,<br /><br />to turn me on.<br /><br />I just need your body, baby,<br /><br />from dusk 'til dawn.<br /><br />You don't need experience,<br /><br />to turn me on.<br /><br />You just leave it all up to me<br /><br />Tell Me Something Good:<br /><br />Problem is you ain't been loved like you should<br /><br />What i got will sure 'nuff do you good<br /><br />It'll do you good<br /><br />Is this what you want your kids singing to all day long? What happened to Chim-Chimery Charoo? What happened to even nonsensical, but at least innocent lyrics for innocent ears? Why are we in such a rush to sex up our kids in this society?<br /><br />The penguins pray to their \\"Great Gwynne\\" (I think that's what they were saying - but I don't read beaks well and there was no closed captioning on the big screen) - a diety in the sky that is the likeness of a giant penguin that they summon with their heart song. I was sitting there in the theater with my gaping maw hanging open. \\"What am I looking at?\\" I kept asking myself. While all the females have waddled out to the ocean to fish, the men stay back with their eggs tucked warmly between their legs. While everyone else is praying to their penguin diety, Memphis is doing his own mantra, summoning what appears to be an image of his wife, Norma Jean. I don't think parents realize what they're taking their kids to go see, quite frankly - this stuff is just weird.<br /><br />All the penguins look basically the same (except for blue-eyed Mumbles, mole-bespeckled Norma Jean and a theological patriarch that has a hunched neck like a vulture), so their big moment of individuality is their heart song. Mumbles practically dances his way out of his egg, but this society where everyone wears the same tuxedo is intolerant of differences, even with a baby. He is shunned by not only classmates, but by adults as well. Even Mumbles' father is unsettled by his son's talent and lack of singing ability.<br /><br />In almost sociopathic fashion, Mumbles entertains himself when he's alone - dancing to a song that is apparently in his head. While charming, it's also kinda weird. Children have an innate desire to belong - yet he'd rather be alone with his own music - and is content to be this way as he dances with fervor.<br /><br />There is some violence as gulls attempt to eat Mumbles alive and he is then persued, bitten and permanently maimed by one of the most vicious renderings of a seal I have ever seen. The folks that club baby seals to death will want this vicious-looking seal as their poster child to advocate further clubbing. The noises this critter makes are akin to the T-Rex in \\"Jurassic Park.\\"<br /><br />As Mumbles escapes death, he encounters another breed of penguis - that all speak Spanish. Kids are just going to be confused - this is Antartica, but everyone here is multilingual. The accents are adorable, but the Spanish flavor is simply not explained... it's not like he travelled to another continent. Another violent scene in which killer whales attempt to eat a group of penguins and nearly drown then choke a penguin to death are painfully uncomfortable to watch - the violence is over the top.<br /><br />Too many movies aimed at children include violence against beloved characters to get emotional involvement, then pepper the movie with cute animals, songs and merriment - so the child is very involved emotionally, but doesn't even realize why. The violence is just too much for the little kids that are going to want to see this movie the most.<br /><br />Mumbles appears to also be a late-bloomer. He's not only a dancer, not a singer - but he is the only penguin that has a child-like lack of development into adolescence. When the other animals have clearly gone through a normal development cycle with the seasons, Mumbles retains his downy coat way beyond a normal period - yet goes swimming. If a real penguin that still had the down on it were to get into the icy Antarctic waters, it would quickly freeze to death or drown. He's also got blue eyes which no one seems to notice or comment on - but he's clearly the only blue-eyed penguin on the entire continent.  Mumbles almost has this Michael Jackson-esque quality about him. He's child-like, optimistic, hangs out with much shorter male penguins, and is a great choreographer. Hmm.<br /><br />A-la Rudolph, this misfit ends up being the salvation of the penguins. They are all quickly singing the penguin's praises after shunning him since he was practically an egg... and join him in a string of dance moves that is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" video.<br /><br />Penguins are adorable, so kids are going to flock to this movie in droves - but it's not all about being cute and fuzzy. The movie is violent and over-sexed for kids. Not only would I not take my own kids to see this video, this is one I don't care to see again. I love kids' films and am partial to the well-done 3D animation, but without a good story line, the best animation in the world does not a good movie make.<br /><br />This film had lots of good potential, but it was not edited properly. Narration opens the film, but then is not heard from again. The songs are not original, but 'sexy' songs redone for a kids' film. As an adult, I enjoyed the film and laughed in spots, but was not won over. It lacks the innocence it purports to embrace.br />Too many movies aimed at children include violence against beloved characters to get emotional involvement, then pepper the movie with cute animals, songs and merriment - so the child is very involved emotionally, but doesn't even realize why.

B00005QFE5|2.0|Although I applaud the fact that Zhang Yi-mou can portray a love story without reverting back to sexual escapades, this moving is just plain boring! When you are watching it it takes forever and there is also this 30 min. snooze of an intro he takes explaining the background for the lovestory between his parents. Goodness gracious do something!  Zhang zi-yi does a great job of prancing about in her pigtails, but I too am flabbergasted as to  how his parents ever fell in love. Unbelievably, they said like two words to each other before deciding they loved each other. i dont call that a great love story, I call it a 3rd grade lunch recess fling.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I just caught this movie last night at blockbuster and decided to try it out. I was actually really impressed by the way that the director and editor made it look how both characters were together talking. <br /> <br />As long as you can put aside time fluxuation absurdities, changing a past by information from the future, and all that Doc Brown warns about in 'Back to the Future' this movie is one sweet one in the middle of our crazed, zombie infested, blood/nudity/gory society that actually is worth watching. <br /> <br />As for the acting... Sandra Bullock certainly pulls the weight of Keanu Reeves cardboard acting and leaves the movie feeling lighthearted and warm. <br /> <br />I certainly enjoyed this movie and would recommend this to anyone who can look past the 'time' problems!
B000E1MTY0|5.0|You can tell the difference between the HD and the regular DVD when it goes to darker screens. HD color is much better than regular DVD and this makes a huge difference of movies like these. Highly recomended !!!

0670034711|5.0|After 3 women had recommended this book to me within the space of one week, I knew I had to pick it up. It didn't disappoint. Any woman at a crossroads who is still looking for herself, inner peace and a sense of perspective in this crazy world will find some incredibly profound thoughts. It's a book to keep on your shelf and re-read a couple times a year. I've bought it for two friends since and have recommended it to my women's group.
0689865384|5.0|...to read and enjoy young adult books, especially this one! I found it hard to put down, and when I got to the third section, I refused to until I'd finished reading it. Now I'm itching to buy the next one.<br /><br />One thing I particularly liked about this book is that, unlike some \\"futuristic super-tech dystopia\\" books, the people who choose to live outside the city don't shun all technology, and are in fact trying to reach some sustainable level of the technology that the city uses.
0812548094|5.0|Wow ... I read the whole book (900+ pages) in about two weeks. It was so addicting, I just could not put the book down. Richard Cypher (Rahl) is one awesome dude! I really like how he thinks outside the box, and doesn't just follow the rules blindly. Awesome read.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This is the most addicting CD I've bought in several years.  The melodies creep into my head at all sorts of weird times. It's like Incubus meets Pink Floyd at Maynard's house.  I love the 'theme' and the whole story it tells.  I love the lyrics.  I love the vocals.  I love the thrashing bass lines.  I love the quiet moments.  I love Adrian Belew.  You don't have enough stars to rate this one...
031236198X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I could relate very much to many organizational changes that have taken place over my career in IT. There are some key lessons learned from the book that I will take away and will definitely keep this on the shelf in my office to share with current and future colleagues.  <br /> <br />
B000005RY7|5.0|While this album contains 8 of Kiss' classic songs (which all of us Kiss fans should have a few copies of each by now, anyhow), it also contains 4 songs that were made specifically for this album in 1982. These 4 tracks feature the short-lived sound that Kiss experimented with around this time, and while not many agreed with it, I'll admit that I really dug it. It shows Kiss' versatility and the tracks are all well-written and performed.
0805047905|5.0|My Toddlers love this book.  They're two and they help me read the story now.  It's one of their favorites.
0743289412|1.0|Like many fans, I hustled to the local bookstore and shelled out my $25 the first day \\"Lisey's Story\\" became available. Even though I was absolutely horrified by several recent King installments, I figured (with DT out of his system, and a half-decent effort to get back to his roots with \\"Cell\\") that the idiotic jacket copy was selling the book short. No such luck.<br /><br />After rushing home to crack the book open, I found myself slightly disturbed by the language (with made-up, grimace-inducing words such as \\"bool\\" and \\"Booya Moon\\" not adding anything to the plot) and actually fell dead asleep on page 30. The next night, it got worse. Annoyed--and dead asleep--at page 33! Wow. Nothing's changed 200 more pages into it. It's horrible, and only my great love and respect for the man that wrote \\"'Salem's Lot\\" compels me to try and finish it. But it ain't going down easy.<br /><br />King's latest work is totally boring, extremely self-referential (yes, the ghostly protagonist is a famous author from Maine), and now just plain silly. Maybe you will enjoy the book, but I think that any serious King fan would agree that his post-accident work is nothing but gruel, which King seems increasingly content to spoon-feed loyal fans such as myself.<br /><br />I may not event finish this book. Amazing, considering I have read every single one, and many of them more than 5 times each... I am very sorry to even be writing trhis review, but I am simply heartbroken that it's finally over!
B000002OZY|5.0|It is 1969. The age old debate that continues to this date is in full force: Who is the greatest of all time. The Beatles or The Rolling Stones? At that point, The Who, while greatly respected, were seldom included in the conversation. However, starting at that point, The Who went on a run (Tommy, Who's Next, Quadrophenia) that The Rolling Stones couldn't touch, and arguably, only The Beatles could rival (Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper.) Greatest of all time? It's still hard to say, but I think the key is the unique sound of The Who. There are bands out there that obviously and easily sound like The Beatles. There are bands that can do a passable Rolling Stones sound. But there is no one out there that sounds like The Who. And there is definitely nothing out there that comes close to Tommy. <br /> <br />The Who raised the bar so high with Tommy, that only they would dare to try to touch it (with Quadrophenia, which comes close, but not quite.) A double album when released, it almost seems too much for a single CD. Pete Townsend is just from another planet here with his writing, musically and lyrically. The instrumentals are incredible. The characters that come alive here (almost ruined by the movie version) are unforgettable. The album just defies what mere words can say. It truly is a Rock Opera, from start to finish. By the \\"finale\\" (We're Not Gonna Take It\\") the listener is literally begging that the album will go on for another 20 minutes. <br /> <br />This is an album that you can hear something different, every time you listen to it, no matter how many times you've heard it. Give it another listen today, and you'll know what I mean.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The Beatles have always created great music. That's a given. Another given is how well the music was recorded. What this CD (and especially the DVD) has done is taken the Beatles music production to a new level (as did the remix of Yellow Submarine). More importantly, this release shows the potential of remixing the Beatles catalog using today's technology.  <br /> <br />As far as the music content of this CD, I would have to say there were some great surprises but also a few minor disappointments. Overall, This is a really fun album to listen to. The only real disappointments were combining \\"Blackbird\\" with \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Come Together\\" with \\"Dear Prudence\\". Having said that, there were some incredible highlights including \\"Drive My Car/What Your're Doing/The Word\\"\\", \\"Sun King (backwards) with Something\\", \\"Strawberry Fields\\", \\"Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\". \\"Within You../Tommorow\\" almost seemed destined to be together. This list goes on and on. You really need to listen for yourself.  <br /> <br />George Martin and his son really knocked a home run. I really need to see the show in LV. <br /> <br />NOTE to George M and Giles: Remix/Remaster the entire catalog! Please! <br /> <br />
B000001FFJ|5.0|Rolling Stones selected this album as the 393rd best album ever made, and I looked over the first 392 that came before it and had trouble understanding how those could be better. <br /> <br />Having been introduced to his music at a time when his music was able to drill right through, I can say that he should almost be outlawed, he's so good. <br /> <br />I think the hightlight of the album is \\"Diamonds & Gold\\" which I really couldn't place in the same category as any song before it by anybody.  It is certainly not a ballad, nor is it a social rant (maybe it is).  The melody is a piercing melody while the lyrics such as \\"catch me a rainbow, steal me a dream\\" makes you wonder how Tom can aim straight at your mental health and hit the bull's eye. <br /> <br />\\"Time\\", as other reviewevers put it, may be his best ballad, though I would put \\"Alice\\" before it.  \\"Hang down your dead\\", while talking about a sad love situation, is a less bleak ballad than Time.   <br /> <br />Then there's \\"Downtown Train\\".  First time I heard it from him (it's his song by the way), I wanted to cry over what Rod Stewart did to it.  Then I wanted to cry about other things, but really, it's another superb ballad.  <br /> <br />The first 4 songs of the album echo the same genre and are almost sung by the same persona, which is rare on a Waits album.  He usually is acting when he's singing.  <br /> <br />Anyway, if you don't already own this album, there really is no excuse for it.  It is very accessible and easy to love.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|Just a quick note everyone. I enjoy the movie. They synopsis that other reviewers have posted are very accurate. However, there is one thing that everyone complains about, and that is the fact that alot of the dialogue is set to music. It's SUPPOSED to be that way. Rent is NOT a musical. In a musical, such as The Sound of Music, the songs are cute little ditties that repeat upon themselves and don't serve to move the plot along. In an opera, the lyrics of the songs are meant to be dialogue. I know what you're thinking. \\"But, Rent isn't an opera! Where's the fat lady that can break glass with her voice?\\" A valid point. But Rent is different. It is a ROCK opera. Whether Jonathan Larsen made that term up himself (yes, he used that term to describe Rent) or it was around before his time, I don't know, but my point it that the lyrics are supposed to function as dialogue. Don't let that throw you off. The music is beautful, and the opening chords of 'Seasons of Love' choke me up every time I hear or play it. Rent is one of my favorite movies, and is well worth the money spent to own it.  <br />FORGET REGRET! <br />HOLLA RENTHEADS!!!!!!! <br />Melenna
B00005JPAJ|5.0|As its biblical title suggests, Babel is about the complexity of human communication and often lack thereof, in today's world.  It covers four countries and is in a range of different languages: Arabic, English, Japanese, Spanish, and sign.  Director Iñárritu, (21 Grams, Amores Perros), delves into how inhumanely we can react with one other when our perceived differences and cultural assumptions take hold, some cases in very ordinary situations. Our preconceptions often veil our reality, in turn keeping us from making human connections with one another.    Four visceral stories are interconnected: the troubled American couple in Morocco struck by tragedy, a deaf-mute Japanese teen coping with loss and the expression of her budding sexuality, a Mexican nanny in California caring for two children, and a Moroccan goat herder purchasing a rifle to drive out threatening jackals.  It is incredibly acted by a cast of mainly unknowns, with the exception of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.  Pitt turns in one of his most gritty performances and cinematographer Rodrigo Pietro is amazing in capturing the ambience and various tones of each location exquisitely.  There may be many heartbreaking moments in Babel, but they are certainly worth the payoff.
0783225849|4.0|Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\" (1960) is a film that has stood the test of time well, and that deserves to be called a classic. I saw it just a few days ago, and was astounded by how good it was. Truth to be told, I don't generally like terror movies, but \\"Psycho\\" is an exception, probably because it is a movie that scares you but also a carefully crafted masterpiece that you can see many times without getting bored.<br /><br />The main character is Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a beautiful blonde that makes an enormous mistake in a moment of weakness. Marion steals a lot of money from her boss, and drives away in order to meet her unsuspecting boyfriend. Alas, she makes an even bigger mistake in the way, stopping at the \\"Bates motel\\". What is hidden there? And will she get out alive?<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent movie, the kind of film all are you are likely to enjoy (unless you absolutely hate any kind of scary movie). Even if you are not partial to black and white films, give \\"Psycho\\" a chance, it deserves it! Highly recommended  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat<br /><br />PS: Pay attention to the bonus features, and try to watch \\"The Making of Psycho\\". It is long, but more than worth your time.
B00005MP58|5.0|I borrowed the six VHS tapes of the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle from the library a while ago and loved it, thought it was the best move I'd ever seen, period. Annoyingly enough, the library only lets me borrow 3 tapes at a time, so I tried renting the Keira Knightley version a few times from a video store. I was disappointed in it the first time, since it just couldn't compare, it was so dreary and dark. I do like the first proposal from Darcy when he is close to kissing Elizabeth, even as he's been rejected and is obviously hurt.  After having watched it a few times I liked it well enough to buy it. Since then I have wanted to watch the better version and borrowed it again from the library but only could take 2 tapes....when I came back the next day they wouldn't let me take the last four, I had to choose three. That was it; I'd had it. How can they expect me to chop up a movie this engrossing  over three days??? I just bought the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle DVD version a couple days ago. <br />I'll probably only watch the Keira Knightley version rarely, the other one is so much more bright and cheery and closer to the book. And having watched Colin Firth as Darcy first, to me he IS Darcy and is who I picture when reading the book.

B00005JPCA|5.0|The gymnastic chase scenes of the new James Bond film, 'Casino Royale' are so stunning, we find ourselves needing a break from the whole game.  With breathtaking camera angles and surprises at every turn, we get a whole new Bond.  Not to mention Daniel Craig who is easily one of the best Bonds since Sean Connery.  He isn't as suave as the former or Pierce Brosnan, but his cool, steely demeanor make him easily as confident and more to be reckoned with.  As one might expect, there are some sweaty hands dealt at an exotic gambling resort, but the urgency of terrorism meated out with card sharks for jihad funds and bomb threats give us a new urgency.  Certainly the tension ups the ante quite a bit.  Bond's new female sidekick, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) has a mysterious allure, and the new Bond demonstrates a love interest--for a  sensitive side--to go with the lust of lush bikinis and evening gowns.  The softer side seems natural enough to provide a needed slow down to the plot and an increased interest from the female audience, but it's not enough to destroy the suave and witty nuances uttered from the coolest private eye ever conceived.  Co-written by Paul Haggis ('Million Dollar Baby' and 'Crash') the script is sharp and funny enough to increase the venue's hand and raise it quite a bit.  Satisfying to the last deal, 'Casino Royale' is a sure bet for moviegoers.

B0000C6K09|5.0|I have been a huge fan of John Williams and I have known about his music for years.  However, I never actually bought any of his music on CD.  I was rather skeptical about purchasing this CD but when it arrived I knew I had made the right choice.  The sound quality of the compilation is outstanding.  The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra do a great job under the direction of Paul Bateman.  The original London Symphony Orchestra CDs of John Williams' Star Wars Trilogy CDs are marginally better but this is still a great CD compilation.  If you love ET, Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Harry Potter, you will love this compilation soundtrack.  Buy it, listen to these CDs in the car and enjoy every minute of the collection!!!

B000IU3XTM|5.0|A question raised to pretty much every new talent is how you will follow up your debut, well received or not.  It's of course much easier to follow up a mediocre debut for expectations are not set very high and you have the opportunity to wow them the second time around.  But in the case of Damien Rice, whose 2002 debut `O' was so brilliantly crafted he's faced with the dilemma of following up a masterpiece.  Damien is one of the few artists who has been able to do this successfully, delivering an album that's just as good (I won't say better) than `O' and just as imaginative and inspired as his previous work. <br /> <br />Starting things off with the hauntingly beautiful `9 Crimes' which attacks the subject of infidelity with raw fervor and haunting truism.  The piano really creates the mood on this song, and it's that piano that also lends it's mood to the final two tracks here as well, the beautiful `Accidental Babies' and the opus `Sleep Don't Weep', both of which are standout tracks here.  `Accidental Babies' in particular really gets to my core and actually brings tears to my eyes as Damien pleads with his ex-lover to leave her man and return to him before they have `accidental babies' or in other words before they make lasting mistakes that bind them apart from one another. <br /> <br />`Sleep Don't Weep' is one of many (or so it seems) that sing of coming to terms with the end of a relationship, and `Sleep' in particular does so elegantly.  Another ballad to ease the pain is `Rootless Tree' which is probably one of the best tracks here.  Here Damien releases his inner anger, going from relating what he expects out of his failed love affair and what he truly feels about her after the fact.  `The Animals Were Gone' is another about the feelings of loss, and this song in particular sounds true to form for Damien, like something we may have heard on `O', as does `Grey Room', both sounding like what we expected to hear.   <br /> <br />`Elephant' or `The Blowers Daughter, II' makes more sense now that I know that.  I at first was thinking \\"these chords sound familiar' and now that I know it's a follow up to the song itself I'm a little more at ease into liking it so much.  It's definitely the sexually frustrated Blowers Daughter, with lines like `this has got to lie down with someone else on top' and that whole `horny' part.   <br /> <br />`Coconut Skins' is one of the funnest songs to listen to here, its whole beat and vibe is jolly almost.  I just love singing along, it really gets my head and feet and hands going at a good pace.  Now that leaves me with `Dogs' and `Me, My Yoke + I' two songs I could have lived without, but neither of which are dreadful to the point of loathing, they just don't really showcase what makes Damien such a brilliant artist.  Oh well, they are the two reasons I won't say this is a better album than `O' but what makes it an outstanding sophomore effort is that it proves to be different than its predecessor for Damien delivers something fresh instead of just recycling perfection track for track.

0553381407|4.0|My life's work has become the involuntary surveying of train wrecks, otherwise known as the 'perfect family'. I read this book cover to cover, and while I found much of it interesting, the prose seemed to only skim the surface about the 'monsters' that lurk among us. Granted, each part of this topic could span several volumes in their own right, but I think what bothered me the most about this book is its publication date - c1989. I was in the depths of undergraduate study when this book was first published, and I have since come to learn that the best resources for people to use are usually the most recent. It's a shame there isn't an updated edition to this book, or that more books have been written about this and other timely mental health issues. It seems that many other forms of investigation and techniques have enjoyed new discoveries. Why not this? 17 years is a long time to wait for new findings. <br /> <br />This book best serves as a guide to understanding the basics of family-related issues, and I agree completely with the author and other reviewers here about seeking professional help in sifting the debris of an unhappy past. When I find the book(s) that complement the material here, I'll be back. <br /> <br />Good Hunting!
6305263248|5.0|This crime caper involving mercenary robbery has become one of my favourite movies of all time. First and foremost because it was set in Paris, a city I love dearly. And secondly because it has some of the most exciting car chases I've seen on film.<br /><br />Though he is the headline star, Robert DeNiro proves what a great acting talent he is and gives a completely selfless performance, stepping back, and giving his co-stars Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Skipp Sudduth, Sean Bean and Jonathan Pryce room to shine. Written, interestingly, actress Rachel Weisz and J.D. Zeik, director John Frankenheimer brings intelligence and tense, high-octane action on to the streets of Paris.<br /><br />Among other things, the DVD extras include an alternative ending and a featurette called \\"Filming In The Fast Lane\\" which tells us how the awe inducing car chases were filmed.<br /><br />If you like gritty urban crime thrillers you'll like this. If you like car chases, you'll love it.
B00001ZWTS|5.0|Although this movie is a little lacking on the remake of the original Wild Wild West....it's supposed to be that way! The comedy is the best.

I own my own personal copy and can't watch the movie enough! Thanks!

B000JJS8TM|1.0|As a collector of Beatle CD's, LP's and 45's with over 4200 items I feel that EMI has really had a good laugh at the collectors expense. This is NOT the way these songs were ever meant to be heard, either from the Beatles or the record companies standpoint. With all the quality music that the Beatles have given us I think I would rather buy the soundtrack from the god awful Beatlemania play. This is capitolism at it's worst. I would of given this 0 stars if allowed but I must admit the sound quality it quite good.

This is such a collection of music.  <br />I have my iPod on and am totally grooving to \\"Forever my Friend\\" in my office, and I don't care who thinks I look silly.

B000JJ4GW0|3.0|First of all, I'm a huge U2 fan.  I have every album the band has put out.  And yes, I even have the two Best Of compilations (Limited Editions, mind you, each with a bonus disc of rare, unreleased material).  With that said, the songs individually on U218 Singles are at least decent in of themselves (some better than others).  However, like everyone else has wondered, it's the selection of songs that comprise the Singles collection.  I'm wondering  (like some other people have wondered) why \\"I Will Follow\\" wasn't included.  Or how about \\"Gloria\\"?  Or even the live version of \\"Bad\\"?  \\"Angel Of Harlem\\"?  \\"All I Want Is You\\"?  \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing\\"?  OK, I'll admit that those were some of my own personal selections and that everyone has their own personal selections.  But anyway, on to the bonus DVD which was why I bought the CD/DVD combo of U218 Singles in the first place...<br /><br />Their concert at Milan isn't all that bad.  I must admit, however, that it's not one of their best performances (for me, in terms of their best concert, it's a tie between Zoo TV Live In Sydney and Live At Slane Castle).  The band opens the concert with \\"Vertigo\\".  Bono sounds visibly out of breath during a portion of the song.  Despite that, the band follows up with an electrifying performance of \\"I Will Follow\\".  The highlight of the concert, in my humble opinion, is \\"With Or Without You\\", the last song on the DVD.  The part where Bono asks the audience to sing towards the end of the song is very inspirational and uplifting.<br /><br />In any case, if you're a huge U2 fan like myself, my recommendation is to buy the CD/DVD combo at least for the Milan concert itself!

B00005JPBP|3.0|While there are interesting elements in the film version of The Prestige, the novel is a brilliant tour de force whose legerdemain is found in its ability to, as magicians themselves do, provide just enough information--but not too much--so that the reader (like the viewer in a magician's audience) is left to puzzle out a number of the pieces by himself. And in fact, the novel has a glorious depth missing in the film.<br /><br />The primary elements are retained from the novel--the rival magicians Borden and Angier, the introduction of the comely and conniving Olivia Wenscombe, the obsessive interest of Angier in the work of pioneering scientist Nikola Tesla--all these are in evidence. But the novel is a devilishly clever work in which the reader is wrapped up in the intricately plotted machinations of each magician against the other. Without giving away the trick, as it were, duplication plays a major role in the story. While that does come across in the film version, the subtlety of the novel by Christopher Priest is not really captured in the film.<br /><br />Everyone knows that film and prose are radically different media and that it can at times be difficult to translate the written word into the moving image. Here the filmmaker, Christopher Nolan (and his brother Jonathan, the co-writer), has opted for a decidedly simplified approach which, on one hand makes it easier for the viewer to follow the film but on the other roughens the nuanced elegance of Priest's prose.<br /><br />There's no question that the film is entertaining. As the two magicians go about their rivalry-fueled business, it's easy to get caught up in the momentum of what will happen next--who will top who, and how it will be done. The actors, surely, were chosen for their showmanship--a combination of their looks and acting ability that would, as do all good magicians, put on a great show. Yet having read the book, the complexity is lost, the depth is discharged, the subtleties are forsaken.<br /><br />For example, in the novel there is a tremendously atmospheric, creepy scene near the end when someone discovers a mass graveyard of sorts and that is nowhere in the film. The entire framing story of the novel in which two modern day descendants of Borden and Angier piece together and puzzle out the events that led to their current relationship, such as it is, is as well discarded. The entirety of Angier's diary is described in detail in the novel, but the film gives us only bits and pieces.<br /><br />Again, this is certainly not a bad film, but for a far richer experience of this story, I urge you to read the novel. It is truly a masterpiece.ken. <br /> <br />For example, in the novel there is a tremendously atmospheric, creepy scene near the end when someone discovers a mass graveyard of sorts and that is nowhere in the film.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I love this movie.  And I love how everyone now acts like they hated this over-the-top love story.  The pic wouldn't have made the money it did if people hated it so much.  If nothing else youhave to give credit for the amount of work that went into a movie this big.  The detail, the music, and even the sappy love story.  But I love sappy and I'm not ashamed of it.  Kate Winlet and Leo have both gone on to be very good actors.  In a way I can't believe that it's been nearly ten years since this movie came out.  Sappy-yes.  But still a captivating piece of work.  Recommended.
1582701709|5.0|This book is a wonderful companion to the movie, \\"The Secret.\\"  I highly recommend seeing the movie and reading the book--if you are interested in learning how to create positive changes in your life and manifest your desires. <br /> <br />There really is no \\"secret,\\" because these theories and teachings have been around for quite a while.  Anyone who is familiar with the work of Jerry & Esther Hicks/Abraham (and other authors), will feel right at home with the material found in \\"The Secret.\\"  The teachings or theories found in this book are ancient wisdom and profoundly true. <br /> <br />But regardless of whether you've studied material like this before, the book and video are a wonderful source of information regarding the art of deliberate creation, the power to create change and manifest one's desires. <br /> <br />It is full of information and teachings from some of the leaders in this field, and it gives practical advice and information on how you, too, can learn to create the life that you desire. <br /> <br />We all have the power within us to create and manifest, in fact we are doing it all the time.  Unfortunately, few of us realize this and we end up creating what we don't want, not what we do want. <br /> <br />So, if you want to become a CONSCIOUS creator and start attracting into your life all the things that you do want---read this book and, follow the guidance and put the teachings into practice.   <br /> <br />---Rev.

0800141601|3.0|I'm a sucker for sappy, but campy doesn't cut it.  Now I admit back in the mid-nineties I was more taken with this movie because frankly I didn't know better.  Probably still on my Pretty Woman high and thought Richard Gere was just too cute for words.  Now as I watch this, I'm struck by how lazy Gere's performance truely is.  While Connery and Osmond performances seem effortless, Richard just phone this performance in.  I'm more annoyed of how instant this deep abiding love Lancelot has for Geneieve-to the point it's an insult to anyone's intelligence.  I love Connery, but seeing him always paired with women old enough to be his granddaughter is tiresome.  Overall, the production looks cheap and most likely majority of the budget went to actor's salaries.  Overall, this romantic romp will do in a pinch.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This resurrection, deconstruction and rebirth of the Beatles' timeless music is nothing short of genius.  Without either the raw talent of the Fab Four, the quality of the original recordings, the sheer artistry of Sir George Martin or even the serendipity of common cadences, this project may very well have been a disaster.  But, the planets were all in alignment, so to speak, and LOVE is a veritable feast for the ears.  (It's no wonder that the music is truly the star of the Cirque show.)  I wish I never heard it so I could have the pleasure of hearing it for the first time all over again!

B000HCO83Q|5.0|A lot of people did not seem to like this picture as much as the other two.  Allow me to be a dissenter.  This actually was my favorite of the three.<br /><br />For those who have not read my other reviews on the X-Men movies, the theme of the series is fighting prejudice.  The bad guy mutants are ready to wage war with the humans who persecute them.  The good guy mutants try to live peaceably with humans and even protect them from the bad guys.  This one reverses the plot from the original movie:  instead of mutants trying to change humans into mutants, there is a new drug humans devised to change mutants into humans.<br /><br />This movie has a parallel theme, which is the matter of choice.  As a minister, I'm familiar with the debate over predestination and free will.  In the story, there are humans who think mutants need to be cured, mutants who oppose this cure, and mutants who believe they don't need to be cured but will allow each individual to make up their mind of whether they want to change.<br /><br />One reason I like this movie is it introduces two of my favorite X-Men comic characters that were so far absent:  The Beast, one of the original X-Men (played superbly by Kelsey Grammer), and the Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), who is a mutant in the movie though not in the comics.  Another original X-Man that makes his movie debut is the Angel.<br /><br />I found the ending of the first movie to be effectively symbolic, and there is an allusion to it in the ending of this movie.  I enjoyed several of the little tangent stories.  I didn't mind the fact that Storm got more attention than usual (and the Wolverine always dominated the stories), but many of the other characters have adequate development.  The movie does seem to close up the trilogy, but I would be happy for a spin-off or a new trilogy or something like that.
B000GRUS22|4.0|First of all, I love ALL of Enigma's albums, even the much-criticised Voyageur. Yes, that was a departure from the \\"old enigma\\", but it was a great album in my opinion.  <br /> <br />So, onto this one: <br /> <br />1. Eppur Si Muove <br />Starts out with a familiar riff, but turns into a very Jean-Michel Jarre sounding track, reminds me heavily of JMJ's Chronology 6. Which is not a bad thing, as I love that track also. Upbeat, electronic. 4/5 for this track. <br /> <br />2. Feel Me Heaven <br />The JMJ-like riff of the first track fades into the background on this one, giving another track that is similar to, but different, to the first one. 4/5 for this one also. <br /> <br />3. Dreaming Of Andromeda <br />Slower, with an operatic singer in the background. 3/5 <br /> <br />4. Dancing With Mephisto <br />Soft-spoken female singer in the background, speaking english with a bit of french. Good tempo and percussion. Very familiar to old Enigma fans. 4/5 <br /> <br />5. Northern Lights <br />Slow one. No vocals. About the same pace/feel as Callas Want Away from Enima's first album. 2/5 <br /> <br />6. Invisible Love <br />Back to very JMJ-like, arpeggio-driven sounds. Michael doing vocals, I think, but not too many (good idea - I think he's not too good when doing lots of vocals). 3/5 <br /> <br />7. Message From IO <br />Builds very much on the last one, but with no vocals. 4/5 <br /> <br />8. Hello And Welcome <br />Slower. Rich, fat, sound. No vocals. Nice and mellow, but with great electric guitar in the background. 4/5 <br /> <br />9. 20,000 Miles Over The Sea <br />Gregorian chanting (?) through a vocoder - not seen that before! Slow, subtle piece. 3/5 <br /> <br />10. Sitting On The Moon <br />Uh-oh, Michael singing lead vocals. Not my favourite type of tune. However, it's growing on me each time I listen to it. 2/5. <br /> <br />11. The Alchemist <br />Best track on the album. A real driving beat. Big fat guitar sound. Wish that it was longer. 5/5 <br /> <br />12. Goodbye Milky Way <br />Non-descript fadeout track. Michael on vocals again and done badly (not enough instruments to make his voice drown into the background). 1/5 <br /> <br />In summary, like others, I was disappointed at first, but it's growing on me, with the exception of the last track...
B0000BWVCM|5.0|When you have a formula or gimmick movie, sequels make it hard for themselves to live up to the original and maintain creativity.  When the movie is based on characters and their development, it is easier to have a successful series.  Star Wars is one example of this; James Bond also avoided a set pattern.  The X-Men series is another example.<br /><br />As in the rest of the series, the theme is dealing with prejudice.  This movie has the most chilling human villain Col. William Stryker (Brian Cox), who creates a crisis for the purpose of achieving his ultimate goal:  ridding the earth of all mutants.  The good guy mutants and the bad guy mutants unite to save the mutants, but Magneto is just as ready to destroy all humans as Stryker is to destroy all mutants.  It is up to the X-Men to save the day.<br /><br />This movie gives fleeting glimpses of several of the characters, giving Pyro more of a role, while giving a brief scene with Kitty passing through walls.  It also gives a short introduction to Cyclops and Banshee.  The main new character is one of my two favorites, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming, doing a wonderful job).  (My other favorite, The Beast, has to wait to Part 3.)<br /><br />I found this movie more exciting than the first.  However, it had a few scenes I found unnecessary, including a couple of PG-13 rated sex scenes.  I'm also uncomfortable with men fighting women, which happened in both scenes, including a lengthy battle between Jackman's Wolverine and a woman.  As a result, I would not recommend this movie as highly as the first and the third.  But that is personal preference.<br /><br />I am hesitant to give much details, but I found some similarity between this movie and Star Trek 2:  The Wrath Of Khan.

B00003CX8J|5.0|I saw a picture on a TV guide (I believe) in 2000, with a picture of a man with three blades coming out of his hand.  At first, I thought it was an ad for the newest Nightmare On Elm Street installment, until I noticed that it was Hugh Jackman in the upcoming movie \\"The X-Men\\".  My mind gave the famous line of Emily Litella:  \\"Well, that makes it completely different.  Never mind.\\"  After all, I had read and loved the X-Men comics when I was younger, and knew enough to know that Jackman was playing the Wolverine.<br /><br />This movie was as good as I could imagine it, and even better.  It had the special effects and action you would expect in a comic book adaptation.  But the movie appealed to the mind as much as to the eyes and nerves.<br /><br />This movie (and actually, the whole series) deals with the issue of prejudice and how to deal with it.  In these movies, it is mutants that are the victims of this prejudice.  The story line says it is a spurt of evolution; there is nothing to scientifically verify this.  Nevertheless, the mutants are feared and persecuted.<br /><br />There are mutant protagonists, led by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and mutant antagonists, led by Magneto (Ian McKellen).  The difference between them is the response to the persecution.  The protagonists seek to live quietly and peaceably with humans, having Xavier's school as a place for protection and refuge.  The antagonists are ready to wage war with the persecutors.<br /><br />In this first installment, Magneto's goal is to transform humans into mutants, which he does to a Senator who wants to have mutants registered (not unlike the Jews in Nazi Germany, a comparison made in the first scene of the movie).  The problem is that humans are unable to withstand the change and end up dying.<br /><br />I avoid detailed plot descriptions in my reviews so I spoil as few surprises as possible.  I will say, though, that Magneto survives the first movie, not unlike Darth Vader surviving in the Star Wars movies.  One thing I like about the movie, though, is that Magneto is not the type of villain you want to see killed.  Magneto and Xavier are not true enemies, but adversaries who would admit the other is really a friend.  I am the type of person who would rather see a villain reformed than executed.<br /><br />This movie is PG-13.  The Senator's death, among other scenes, keep this from being a family movie.  However, I have no problem with teenagers seeing this movie.viving in the Star Wars movies.

B000G759LW|5.0|Every blue moon the universe sends us a musical prot&eacute;g&eacute; to inspire and move us in ways that only music can. Christina is a gift, and despite what one might think of her on the surface, her musical genuis cannot be denied. Just listen to the track \\"Without You\\" on the first CD of this gorgeous and delicious collection of music. Her vocals sore, tempt and tease throughout the track, even the production and arrangement captures you in ways music rarely can. I often like to sing along when I listen to great music, but I find myself, when listening to Christina, sitting in quiet awe.

B00000K19E|5.0|Just watched the trilogy with my 11-year-old son (third time for me). Amazing, amazing premise and film. Very archetypal and truly takes one down the rabbit hole.

B000HT386M|3.0|Click is the latest Adam Sandler film in the tradition of Happy Gilmore, 50 First Dates, and Mr. Deeds.  That means it displays his trademark humor, and is full of wacky secondary characters.  I had to watch this movie over two nights, and after the first night (about 45 minutes), I thought, this is a good, funny movie.  The conflict had been set up.  Sandler plays an overworked dad who hardly has time to spend with his wife or kids.  One night, he goes to by a universal remote.  He comes home with a remote that not only works on his television, but his life.  He can fast forward through traffic jams, pause other character, or mute his nagging wife.<br /><br />Sandler is having fun trying out his new product.  I resumed the movie the next night, and the movie immediately became tedious and boring.  The plot is basically a take on the Christmas Carol, but instead of ghosts of Christmas pasts, you have a remote that takes you to what your life could be like if you don't change.  So, the last half of the movie shows Sandler neglecting his wife and kids and lamenting the fact that he can't change anything because of the out of control remote control.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a highlight of the movie.  Christopher Walken is quirky and funny.  Kate Beckinsale is beautiful, but not much else.  Sean Astin and Rob Schneider each have their moments, as does David Hasslehoff.<br /><br /> I think this movie might have had a lot of potential, but somewhere along the line it went astray of original comedy.  This movie is full of sexual innuendo and bad language and the PG 13 rating should not be ignored.  After the fun of 50 First Dates, this movie was a big disappointment.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|A fascinating movie, with excellent acting by everyone involved. With its circuitous story-telling and hand-held-camera feel, I could certainly understand that this movie might not appeal to everyone.

0060934913|4.0|About a year and a half ago I was in Manhattan, staying at E. 29th & Lexington Ave. I wandered over a block and ran into Brasserie Les Halles. I'm probably flaunting my ignorance here, but at the time, I had no idea who Chef Anthony Bourdain was. I'd never seen his books or his now somewhat overexposed face on television. It was about 3:00 pm, when my wife and I entered the fairly large and very authentic-feeling French Bistro. After consulting the menu, I had my eye on one of the several beef variations. Our server, a youngish woman of relatively unspectacular attributes, urgently suggested that we try the special, which to the best of my recollection was an oxtail of sorts. We needed to hurry because there were only two orders left and it would be a shame to miss out on such a gastronomical delight. I kind of remember it being not unlike an osso bucco. I wish I had read \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" before we both ordered the \\"special\\" that day. The handsome dish arrived in all its glory, with its rich sauce having reduced way too long, which unfortunately caused the meal to be much too salty. About $75 later we left, a little dissapointed, but not completely pissed off, as there was a certain something about the place and our experience, that felt substantial. There was a sensibility of quality that permeated our lunch. Say what you will about Mr. Bourdain's in your face style, but the man has a refreshing, clear and invigorating approach. His take is based on real-life, in the trenches experience. He is very intelligent, has a great sense of humor and is actually a very talented writer. And for those mush-head vegetarians who may be insulted by his opinions, take a page out of his book and stop taking yourselves so seriously! Better yet, don't read his books or eat in his restaurants. I happen to live in Berkeley and I'm happy to report that yes, we can all get along. Kitchen confidential is a very entertaining, well written book with something for everyone. I only wish he had been present that day, as it would have been fun ripping into him about the too-salty food, not realizing he is actually the anti-celebrity and at the top of the heap of the cooking world.

B000I5Y9G8|4.0|Over, released in 1977, known mostly as Peter Hammill's divorce album was written during the breakup of his marriage.  With the various themes of resentment, denial, reflection and hope surrounding such a dismal ending, this album is not exactly the kind of music you can pop in any old time.  The music itself has an interesting mix straight forward rock (Crying Wolf), simi-progressive rock (Time Heals/ Lost And Found), art rock (Yoga), and gorgeous ballads with only a string section backing him (Autumn/...Looking Glass).<br /><br />Over was in some ways the first of it's kind, being so bare and introspective, approaching such a private matter as the dissolution of a marriage.  The only other \\"divorce album\\" I can think of before or around that time is Marvin Gaye's equally excellent Here My Dear which came out a year later, and started out as a contractual obligation rather than an inspired revelation.<br /><br />Peter Hammill is one of the more deftly insightful and introspective singer/songwriters of the last 40 years; the type of thoughtfulness, brilliant wordplay and expression is certainly a rarity of art in this day and age, let alone in the world of rock.  As the songwriter and leader of Van Der Graaf Generator as well as numerous solo efforts, Hammill wrote songs that asked all the searching questions about God, existence, relationships, and anything else one might question because of it's seemingly dual nature.  Introspective art does not lend itself easily to mass appeal; sometimes too extreme, Hammill's music is not always pretty or agreeable but the integrity and honesty comes out in all it's substance, and purely shows an experience in the human condition.<br /><br />Over was recorded around the same time as the final VDGG studio album of the 70's, The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome.  So there are quiet a few similarities to the sound of those two albums; most notably is the use of Graham Smith's violin, and there is a production sensibility that is familiar to both as well; although Over's sound is a great deal more lean than that of The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome.<br /><br />Every song on Over is superb.  The real standout is the cinematic This Side Of The Looking Glass with it's chilling string section and amazing ebb and flow of emotions; Peter Hammill's voice had never sounded so vulnerable as it did on this track.<br /><br />Autumn is a tearful realization of the shock of the end of the relationship- all the concerns of splitting their lives in two and the people it will effect- a very moving piece.  Betrayed has a great vocal performance and quickly builds into a helpless rant with the violin aiding PH's \\"caught-between-yearning-and-angst\\" lyrics/singing.  Yoga is another highlight with its continuing power chord \\"gonging\\" and the aloofly disillusioned guitar solo slowly whizzing in and out of a pretty folk structure.<br /><br />The final song, Lost And Found has a progressive-rock structure and uses the theme of La Rossa (from the VDGG album Still Life) as an interesting reference in a part of the song.  Lost And Found puts all the troubled emotions and memories to the past, and sees hope and learned lessons, but leave with a statement that doubles as a question about the future of his life.<br /><br />The three bonus tracks include two from a John Peel radio show; Betrayed and Autumn are with PH on piano and vox accompanied only by a violin.  They are superb and breathe new life into the songs because of the immediacy of the performances.  Also the sound quality of those two recordings is amazing.  The third bonus track is a live version of This Side Of The Looking Glass with PH alone on piano and vox; the song is way more aggressive.  It's interesting to hear it from a new perspective but it does not have the touching soul searching quality of the studio version.  Not to mention that the sound of the recording has a lot of snow in it.<br /><br />The new re-mastered albums (both of Hammill and VDGG) soundamazing, clearing up details and showing the fullness of the music.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Some other albums of Peter Hammill I would recommend are pH7, Nadir's Big Chance, The Future Now, Fool's Mate, and The Silent Corner And Empty Stage; as for VDGG stuff all the albums are superb but some are very different than others- Pawn Hearts or Still Life are pretty good places to start.of Hammill and VDGG) sound amazing, clearing up details and showing the fullness of the music.  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended.   <br />Some other albums of Peter Hammill I would recommend are pH7, Nadir's Big Chance, The Future Now, Fool's Mate, and The Silent Corner And Empty Stage; as for VDGG stuff all the albums are superb but some are very different than others- Pawn Hearts or Still Life are pretty good places to start. <br /> <br />
B00005JLTN|4.0|Watched RELOADED again (for the third time) in a 3-day MATRIX-palooza with my 11-year-old son (fast-forwarded thru the kissing scenes). Good sequels are hard to find, and the original MATRIX was so impressively mind-blowing in its originality that I would have been hard-pressed to come up with this story line.<br /><br />The first time I watched RELOADED, I walked away unimpressed. But watching RELOADED in sequence, it makes much for sense.<br /><br />A few personal observations...<br /><br />1. The multi-Smith fight. This fight felt WAAAY over the top. I'm a martial artist, so I know what I'm watching for in a full-speed fight. This fight had so much going on that even I had trouble paying attention by the end of the fight...not sure how non-martial artists watched this.<br /><br />2. Zion. Apparently there are older people in Zion (on the council, at least), but they don't appear to come to the big party in the temple. Kinda weird, that.<br /><br />3. Highway chase scene. Okay, that was just nuts. Went on far too long.<br /><br />4. Evil ghost twins. Started to feel like I was watching STAR WARS I all over again. Build build-up on the evil, Darth-Maul-ish characters ... very little actual screen time. These were fun bad guys in a freaky way ... couldv'e done a lot more with them.<br /><br />Small criticism for a sequel, really...<br /><br />Recommended!
0061120081|5.0|Excellent read!  Strong characters with a teasing story left me wanting more and more so I read it in one sitting over the thanksgiving break. The book was easy to fold back, the print was not harsh on my stigmatism and the feel of the book was great.  The story was fascinating, engrossing, and I was totally captivated by the unfolding drama.  The narrating character, scout, unveiled the hipocricy of americans in their attitudes towards people of a different color, different economic status, different religion, and people with disabilities.  She allowed her reader, through literature, to see the human nature of many people to pass judgement on others without judging themselves first.

B0006399FS|2.0|There might be good music on this disk.  But something happened in between what came out of the band and what was shipped. The mix, production and mastering is so incredibly poor, the disk is physically painful to listen to - at any volume.  <br /> <br />It only got two stars out of sympathy for the musicians, whose hard work has  been so thoughtlessly destroyed by people who ought to know better.  <br /> <br />I'm really bummed.

B0007NFL18|1.0|get rich or die tryin is not comparable to this album, because his freshman album was straight up hardcore gangsta with great songs throughout the album exclusinf Wanksta and in da club b/c they were old. but on THIS ALBUM he came out pretty soft. i would say he has gone pop becasue the soundtrack for his movies is garbage as well and i own all his albums not that i'm sucker it just that i though he'll go back to hardcore gangsta music at some point but didn't happened. if you're looking for an old 50 album which is good look for guss whos back? album. overall i think this album is bubble gum.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Any self respecting Beatles fan must, at all costs buy this amazing new cd.<br /><br />George Martin, who was often considered the 5th Beatles, and his son have taken all of the Beatles music, all of the master tapes, outtakes, sound effects and transformed it all into an incredible listening experience.<br /><br />Brilliantly splicing songs into one another and with improved sound quality that will absolutely knock your socks off, this is without a doubt the best album of the year, in my humble opinion. Even the stand alone songs that are not mixed into one another have an unbelievable jolt of life that beckons for all of the Beatles albums to be remastered in this way.<br /><br />This sounds like a brand new Beatles album in every sense of the word. I am totally blown away by this piece of work. The music just jumps right out of the speakers and grabs you by the chest! It's vibrant and thumping and full of life.<br /><br />On first listen I did not look at the track listing, eagerly awaiting what was coming next, and trying to quickly guess where all the parts came from to fit so perfectly. A thrill ride to say the least.<br /><br />I thank George Harrison for coming up with the original idea for setting the Beatles music to a show that is now a huge hit in Las Vegas. And I thank Olivia Harrison, Yoko Ono, Paul and Ringo for giving their approval and blessing to what George Martin has put together when he was asked to do this.<br /><br />And my deepest thanks and congratulations to George Martin, who continues to show true brilliance, second to none, when it comes to The Beatles music.<br /><br />I love this album.<br /><br />A SOLID 5 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />As I said, this incredible piece of work shows why the entire Beatles catalog needs to be remastered by Sir George and his son before it's too late.
B0002B15WE|5.0|DIE HARD is one of the seminal films of the comedy action-adventure genre, having given birth to three sequels and countless imitations. DIE HARD is a well-acted, well-written, well-produced, and well-directed film that never goes stale. At its core a \\"heist\\" movie, DIE HARD transcends the usual smallish scale of that label with huge set-piece sequences and nonstop action.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays John McClain, a New York cop on vacation in L.A. to see his estranged wife Holly Gennaro (Bonnie Bedelia) who is working for the Nakitomi Corporation. The Nakitomi Christmas party is rudely interrupted by the arrival of the sharp-dressed Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his gang, a group of German terrorists-cum-burglars who seem to have a political agenda but are mostly in it for the money.<br /><br />The slovenly McClain avoids being captured and wages an incredibly violent one-man guerrilla war from within the building against Gruber's gang with moral support from an L.A. cop on the ground (Reginald VelJohnson) and no support from the L.A.P.D. brass. Pushed by McClain, Gruber eventually drops out of the picture and Mr. and Mrs. McClain get to spend a happy if not entirely tranquil Christmas Eve together.<br /><br />DIE HARD, like the INDIANA JONES series and LETHAL WEAPON films is a prime example of the \\"Lunchpail Superman\\" film (as though Clark Kent decided to fight evil in his street clothes); as such, these films have an instant and lasting appeal. Bruce Willis, nobody's idea of extraordinary, is the actor non plus ultra of this genre. Even though the subsequent DIE HARD installments faded progressively. they (and this) are well worth your time.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is John's Masterpiece...and he will only make better albums from every release. Buy it! nothing more needs to be said.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love this show and miss it greatly. Everyone should at least sit through the first episode - it is likely that they will be hooked. Even people who do not normally watch scifi seem to love the characters and become instant \\"brown coats\\". I highly recommend this to everyone.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Some people compared this offering as the country version of \\"Ray\\".  In actuality, this movie is both the life story of Johnny Cash and the love story between him and June Carter.  The movie is solid with impeccable performances particularly by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  In \\"behind the scene\\" feature, the Director himself commented that both performers exceeded his expectations and they managed to get their mannerisms spot-on.  What impresses me even more is the downright chemistry & effortless bond that those performers are able to convey of Johnny Cash and June Carter.  The movie has moments of flashback and it tracks down Johnny's gradual rise and downfall and his victory over his demon in a linear progression and along the way, we get to see Johnny's fascination with June since childhood, how their lives collided, how his persistency finally paid off in winning her heart over.  It's surreal to see his performances together with other prominent performers in the fifties such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis & Roy Orbinson.  Once again, in the special edition, the Director compiles individual performances of Johnny, June and the mentioned three performers into a jukebox sequences that can be enjoyed on its own merit.  The special edition also has interviews of Johnny's friends and relatives who talked about his faith, him as a person (and not simply a singer), the process of getting the real Johnny Cash and June Carter to approve of this movie (overall, it takes a decade to bring it into fruition) and also the making of Joaquin and Reese into the real stars.  A matured and heartfelt movie that's made with a lot of guts and love.  Mesmering to watch and highly recommended.
B000ICL3KG|2.0|I just watched this. I do not recommend it for people who like to be presented with both sides of an issue and form an objective, educated opinion. The film did have interesting points but it was full of statistics and studies used out of context.  <br />I would like to see a documentary with a little more objectivity and a lot less agenda. <br />Don't get me wrong, we do need to each do our part to preserve the ozone. This is our home and we are all responsible. It's like having sloppy housemates in college. You can't constantly pick up after all of them, and you can't force them to change their ways.  <br />Let's all be consciencious of the effects of pollution and realize that we effect it individually. Remember that you can't control other people's pollution, but take comfort in knowing that there is a Power much greater than ours, and that is the Creator of this world.  <br />This movie only seems to try to create a panic about all this. Let's stay objective.
0446528056|5.0|I loved this book. I read it in one sitting. It was very sad and feel like there could definitely be a sequel. It's not Spark's best work in my opinion but it has definitely earned a spot among my favorites. Worth reading!
B000IU3XTM|5.0|('Blower's Daughter' was played at the end of the movie 'Closer').. <br /> <br />This one, \\"9\\", is much more varied, with some all out rock songs, intermixed with his trademark heart-wrenching alt-folk songs, the use of more drums, electric guitars, piano, etc...  <br /> <br />During the first listen, I was thinking its only use would be what one would listen to before blowing your head off, or driving off a cliff at 140mph.  After several listens - the dynamics of the album really come out, and each song invokes a different mood, from melencholy, to anger, to sadness, to hair raising, throat lumping, anguish...  <br /> <br />Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan aren't singing overly obtuse lyrics here - it's pretty obvious what each song is about, no need to over-psychoanalyze these lyrics - and their ability to match the emotion of the vocals with the lyrics is dead-on.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended - even if you aren't really into \\"Alt-Folk\\" (which, I'm not, actually).  <br /> <br />Also, the \\"Demo\\" version of \\"9 Crimes\\" (available on one of those big online MP3 music stores) is highly recommended as well.  It's all guitar (tuned up three steps) and all Damien singing.....Sped up a good bit with drums as well.  Grab it as well if you like \\"9 Crimes\\"!
B000ADWDF2|4.0|(spoilers)<br /><br />The Danish film, \\"Brothers,\\" offers a powerful reminder that the dehumanizing effects of war often extend far beyond the confines of the battlefield.<br /><br />In this tale of two siblings who couldn`t be more different, Michael is the \\"good\\" son, a solid family man with a wife and two daughters and a very strong sense of moral rectitude.  Jannik is the \\"bad\\" son, a ne'er-do-well drifter who is routinely in trouble with the law and who, as the movie opens, has just been released from prison for seriously injuring a woman in a botched robbery attempt.  When Michael is shipped to Afghanistan as part of a U.N. fighting force, he is quickly shot down and taken prisoner by the Taliban militia.  Believing him to be dead, the military mistakenly informs Michael's family that he has been killed in action.  Jannik is so devastated by the loss of his brother that he vows to help Sarah raise her two daughters.  Against their better judgment, Jannik and Sarah begin to develop romantic feelings for one another, a situation that leads to great complications after Michael is eventually freed from his captivity and he attempts to pick up where he left off back home.  Unfortunately, Michael's return to normalcy is further complicated by the memory of a heinous act he was \\"forced\\" to commit against one of his fellow soldiers while in the camp.  Before long, Michael is taking out his anger, guilt and frustration on his own terrified family, and in a sudden role reversal, it is Jannik who must now come to the aid of the brother who had always been there for him when he needed him most.  In many ways, this is a story about two brothers who both find redemption for sins of the past.<br /><br />Although the love triangle aspect could easily have relegated \\"Brothers\\" to the realm of soap opera, the movie manages to avoid that fate, thanks partly to the restrained way in which the script deals with the subject matter and partly to the sense of reality that permeates the film.  These are all fully fleshed-out human beings trying to cope with events far beyond their control - be they the brutalizing psychological effects of a war in a foreign land or the more familiar entanglements and complexities in all things related to the human heart.  No one is made out to be the \\"hero\\" or the \\"villain,\\" which belies the wisdom of labeling people in such simplistic terms to begin with (as the boys` father clearly does, having long ago declared Michael to be his one \\"true\\" son and all but disowning the troublesome Jannik).  The film is filled with haunting, memorable moments that touch us at a deep level, as we see a decent man being driven to madness by a single gruesome action in his life, as well as the devastating ripple effect it has on those he loves.<br /><br />The actors - Ulrich Thomsen, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, and the exquisite Connie Nielsen - truly make us care about the characters they are playing, and the final scene of confession and redemption is haunting in its subtlety and simplicity.<br /><br />As one of the first films willing to acknowledge, let alone explore, the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the small-scaled but memorable \\"Brothers,\\" written by Anders Thomas Jensen and co-written and directed by Susanne Bier, earns a place in movie history.ates the film.

B000ICL3KG|3.0|Movie is combination of Gore trying to sound like he is the only one trying to save our earth and that Bush and oil companies are evil...   <br /> <br />Good overview of the problems we're seeing and the evidence is real so we all do need to do our part. <br /> <br />Gore points out population is huge part of the equation but fails to provide an answer as it is not convenient to talk about population control for either party... <br /> <br />The republican right is in the wrong but so are the left's who still drive suvs, go to starbucks and buy 50\\" plasma's...  If we want cheap items, we're only promoting this global issue. <br /> <br />Aside from self promoting pieces, movie is a great rental.   <br /> <br />A buy for most environmentalists (but why buy and have it shipped as that uses fuel...)
B000002HMH|5.0|Boy, there was a lot of negative feelings around the release of Load.  The band showed up with short hair cuts and a less thrashy sound.<br /><br />This will never compare to Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning and I cannot imagine how much could.  Then again, very few songs will ever compare to 'Hero of the day', easily one of the best songs on Load and one of Metallica's best songs, even if it is radio friendly.<br /><br />Overall, there's a great feel all over Load and re-Load.  Check them both out for some great music!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This was honestly one of the best movies I've seen all year. It made me laugh harder than I've laughed in ages and also made me cry. The acting is superb. Definitely not one to be missed!
B00000FCBC|4.0|This pretty much a cd filled with covers.  Some work better than others but mostly there are no real duds here, except for the completely out of place 'So What'.  This song is so far over the top that it stops being interesting almost immediately.  When I go on rants against hip hop music it's usually because I consider it so much more offensive than what groups like Metallica usually put out.  So for them to record a song like 'So What' is a big let down.<br /><br />Ok, enough of that rant.  The rest of the cd - like I said earlier - is pretty good.  It just isn't essential.  What you get here is a feel for music that influenced the band.  'Turn the Page' is a stand out that should not work but ends up being a near masterpiece.  Another tune I like a lot is 'Astronomy'.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|Once upon a rare now and then an album comes along that can be called an instant classic. This is most definately one of them. This gem ought to be a shoe in for album of the year. \\"Orphans\\" goes a long way in proving that sometimes what's old is new again. Beautifully packaged, arranged and performed, this one is like a carefully curated retrospective of some of the best pieces he's never released for one reason or another. For 40 bucks or so, you'll get way more than your money's worth. You might want to get 2 and keep one in the wrapper just for posterities sake.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Two big surprises here, the first is that a documentary on global warming can be entertaining.  This is very entertaining, without trivializing an important issue.  The second surprise is that Al Gore can project a personality.  That may not surprise everyone, and indeed given his dry delivery and even drier wit, some might still take issue with the contention that he can be more than a stuffed shirt.  But this is effort that can hold the attention of even casual viewers, and that alone makes it an important movie.  If you saw An Inconvenient Truth in the theater, you'll be pleased to note that some of the content has been updated for the DVD release.<br /><br />Al Gore's credentials as a tree-hugging environmentalist (and I say that with the utmost of respect) are unchallenged.  So you might be excused for expecting an overly alarmist approach to this presentation of what greenhouse gasses and global warming are doing to our planet.  But the numbers are scary enough as is.  These are data that have been well documented and carefully analyzed to present a clear picture of an issue that is being distorted by various special interests and political segments.  You can argue the validity of the scientists' projections, but you can't deny the historical numbers, and those numbers suggest that we are on a very, very disturbing road.<br /><br />Don't believe the numbers?  How about some comparison photos (taken within our lifetimes) that show the receding snow cap of Mount Kilimanjaro receding; photos of glaciers in Europe and elsewhere that have almost disappeared and threaten to do so within just a few years.<br /><br />In 2003, Senator James Inhofe posited that \\"man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.\\"  That is flat out wrong sir!  If you would open your eyes and ears, instead of listening with your wallet, you would know that.
B000H7JD90|2.0|I'm sorry but I don't want to hear Justin's \\"love sounds\\" He sounds so girlie when he sings. I don't want to know his \\"Future Sex\\" plan or hear his love sounds. With his high voice, he can't sound too manly when he has an orgasm. Now, I give this album a second star because the lyrics are good and in some songs, he doesn't use his high voice as much. So, if his voice wasn't so high pitched, I'd probably be able to give this a higher rating
0670038040|4.0|It is difficult to tell in this latest Rumple adventure whether the reign of terror refers to the fact that Hilda Rumpole, She Who Must be Obeyed, is writing her memoirs on a laptop and consorting with Justice \\"Mad Bull\\" Bullingham, or if it is the Timsons yet again. <br /> <br />Or maybe it is the Pakistani doctor who has been detained with no explanation, and no chance to see the charges against him. Rumpole of course defends the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights and does his best behind-the-scenes machinations to get his client a trial with real evidence. Will he be able to expose to the court the facts as he suspects they truly are? <br /> <br />A typical Rumple adventure here, with real wit and sparkling dialogue and clever characters. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Definitely a light mystery not to be missed.
B000J10EQU|3.0|This movie was a big let down for me, being a fan of superman and the first 2 movies. I problems I had with this movie: <br />1. why did Superman come back to Earth in a rocket Naked? <br />2. What year is it? <br />3. why is Superman a DEADBEAT DAD? <br />4. Why is Superman a peeping tom? <br />5. Why does one lttle crystle mess him up but then he can lift a whole island of it? <br />6. Why the hell does he go to the hospital? <br />7. Why does supermans kid have powers?  <br />8. why is Superman depressed the whole movie? <br />This movie is just a confusing mess. But the FX's were cool. <br /> <br />
B000H30B2C|5.0|Though I loved The Lord of the Rings, I almost skipped this movie when it came out in theaters. Instead, I saw it and spent half the time with my jaw dropped in amazement. When it finished, I could only sit there and realize I'd seen one of the great movies of all time. I felt grateful to have lived to see it.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Well, maybe something got past me because I am not a NASCAR devotee, but this one seemed pretty much an ordinary \\"fish out of water\\" story with few twists or turns or delights.  It isn't that it is bad.  In fact, it is even enjoyable to watch with kids.  However, it just didn't have any \\"wow\\" factor.<br /><br />The look is pretty good and some of the cars are even dazzling (if preposterous) to look at.  However, the story of the selfish young hotshot having to basically lose it all, but then learning about friends who pull him through is quite old.  It is a useful story for kids to learn (and adults who didn't learn the lesson as kids), but somehow I wanted Pixar magic to kick it into overdrive - to use some Nitro.  But it just sort of plodded along.<br /><br />The voices were all good.  Why Paul Newman is there becomes clear in the second half of the movie.  Owen Wilson puts in the right amount of ego with enough humanity to learn as the star \\"Lightning McQueen\\" (will that name seem cool to anyone who doesn't know Steve McQueen?  McQueen???).  Bonny Hunt is good as Sally Carrera.  And Tony Shaloub and Cheech Martin are fine color characters.  Especially fine, I would say.<br /><br />But do we really need Larry the Cable Guy as Tow Mater?  Isn't that awfully - well, awful?  It isn't that I hated them going out tractor tipping, or Mater showing McQueen some moves that McQueen didn't understand, but a buck toothed hick?  Who thought that was witty?  Let them know it wasn't.<br /><br />The bit with John Ratzenberger over the credits was quite well done and shows the kind of sparkle that I wish had been in the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Still, a pretty good movie.  Just not up to the standards we expect from Pixar.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|Casanova is a great movie! I have noticed  they have made a lot of movies putting real life characters in fictional stories. Sometimes I think the movie played on the fact that in reality Casanova really WAS all the things Franchesca thought he was! Which to me makes if funnier! Even though the movie was fictionious, I would be willing to bet that there were true events in it. One more thing: While I believe Casanova really did love Franchesca, I would not be surpriesed if he could NOT be faithful to her. It never appeared that he actually PROMISED to be faithful to her. No matter what the reason was for him bedding a bunch of women, I still would never believe a womanizer could be faithful to one woman. Not to say that they could not have one true love though. I would be willing to bet that even Franchsca will wonder if he could be faithful to her. To me that will always be the unspoken question. I could actually picture Casanova promising to be faithful to Franchesca, and her telling him not to make a promise he knew could not keep. As I said though, great movie! Those are just somethings about the movie that could really make me double over in laughter! <br />Chantell Snyder
0670038040|5.0|I was surprised to say the least when I saw this latest Rumpole tale by John Mortimer. I had assumed, having recently read Graham Lord's unflattering biography of Mortimer (also reviewed on Amazon), that the distinguished author and playwright was no longer actively writing.  In fact, Sir John has been in poor health for the last several years, but was still quite capable of captivating a large turnout of Washington folk at the Smithsonian several years ago. As usual, Mortimer has some bones to pick through the device of the Rumpole format.  This time around, since the book revolves around a Rumpole client accused of terrorist activity, his target is the national security state mentality which has infected the Tony Blair government in the UK just as it has here. In order to defend his client, Rumpole must confront the \\"catch-22\\" aspects of the British legal system, as \\"reformed\\" by the \\"war on terror.\\"  A firm believer in Magna Charta, the English Bill of Rights, and the wisdom of juries, Rumpole has no little difficulty in squaring his conception of fair legal procedures with the system now in place.  As if defending a suspected terrorist were not enough, Rumpole's wife Hilda has undertaken to write her own secret memoirs. The usual cast of Rumpole characters is present (FIG Newton, the Timson clan, Claude Erskine-Brown, and Judge Bullingham), and it is such a pleasure to see Rumpole (and Mortimer) back in action once again. For my money, there is no wittier author currently writing than John Mortimer; this book (while not the most sparkling Rumpole) continues to delight in its skillful narrative, humor, and its deflating of those who take themselves far too seriously.  We could certainly use an American Mortimer--until then, we can continue to enjoy and learn from the British version.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|When I bought Fallen at the beginning of September, I popped it into my CD player and was instantly hooked. I'd only recently been introduced to the music of Evanescence thanks to my X girlfriend, though I'd known of them since they came onto the music scene. With a month to go before the release of Open Door, I was hoping for something similar to Fallen. Well, I bought the album three days or so after it came out and popped it into my CD player. Though I can't honestly say I was instantly hooked, there were still a few songs that I just had to hear again, notably Lithium. With each listen however, I became more atuned to the album. Yes, this CD does take a bit of getting used to, but it's still worthwhhile. The first four tracks in particular, Sweet Sacrifice, Call me when you're Sober, Weight of the World and the aforementioned Lithium, are songs that I'll pop the album in just to hear. Lithium is not, despite its name, a cover of the Nirvana song of the same name. The melody is great and the lyrics are equally so. <br />  Cloud Nine isn't my favorite but it's still a good song. Snow White Queen is, as one reviewer commented, chaotic and disorganized, but given what it's about, it's oddly fitting. Lacrymosa is a bizarre but still good mix of classical and goth rock. Like You is, when you get down to it, a more developed version of Hello and, unlike that Fallen gem, it actually makes mention of Amy's deceased sister, even if not by name. It starts off quiet and, at the end, picks up into a rocking crescendo as she laments, \\"I long to be like you, sis.\\" <br />  Lose Control opens with a piano intro and rapidly progesses into a powerful rocker. The Only One is a slower, somewhat softer track with a more electronic feel. It's followed by my least favorite song on the album, Your Star. The melody itself is cool (I particularly like the piano), but the lyric just didn't catch my attention the way so many of Amy's others have. <br />  All that I'm living for combines hard rock with an electronic beat and still manages to earn more than a few listens from me. <br />  The album closes with Evanescence's first almost contented song, Good Enough. Interestingly enough, the intro was originally written for the Chronicles of Narnia movie but was rejected. This is a track that shows off Amy's talent for playing the piano. The lyrics, unlike so much of Evanescence's other stuff, actually convey a sense of almost contentment, though as she says, \\"I'm still waiting for the rain to fall, 'cuz I can't hold onto anything this good.\\" <br />  In short, The Open Door was the best not quite ten bucks I've spent in a while, and despite the longer period needed to acclimate to the new sound, it still finds its way into my CD player on a daily basis. \\"It's not Fallen.\\" they say. And when you look at the cover, you realize that they're right. Oh wait, you meant it doesn't sound the same. Yeah, well that was the idea. Get used to it.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|More of a drama than a comedy, this poignant film I believe is probably the best movie of 2006.  Each of the characters is absurd but oddly believable.  Many touching moments.  An unpredictable but uplifting ending. Great acting.  The little girl could charm a grizzly bear. Despite her external imperfections, her big heart, touching naivete and optimistic attitude will captivate you.  I guarantee you will walk out of this movie a better person and with a smile on your face.  How many films can do that?

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I grew up with The Beatles and enjoy their music, but I'm not a rabid fan. I have most of their other CDs in my collection, but rarely listen to most of them, other than Abbey Road and a few other favorite tracks. But this album was a real wake up call. It brings something fresh to even the most convention tracks, and the more experimental ones are amazingly compelling. Far from being a gimmick, the layering of different sources brings something entirely new while making me appreciate the original artistry even more. Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!/I Want You (She's So Heavy)/Helter Skelter is a particular favorite' I was sure I knew where it was going, then it pulled the rug out from under me. It's hard to believe this was recorded 40 years ago! This is The Beatles album I will listen to over and over.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I loved it as I watched it! It has one of the most, I dare say, sophisticated graphics ever made. The story is rather complicated but not to make it hard to think.. by all means somehow it kinda represents Japanese way of showing their true beauty. Honestly, Japanese people really concern much about CG arts, which is quite understandable why most anime refers to Japan. Anyway, It`s a must have movie for everyone.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|It's no secret that Incubus like to surprise listeners with each album they release. Dating back to 1999, when they made a huge stylistic change from the speed-funk of \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\" to the more mature, introspective hard-rock of \\"Make Yourself,\\" Incubus have built a career on being both original and unpredictable. Therefore, anyone who has followed them this far has learned to expect the unexpected. \\"Light Grenades,\\" the band's sixth full-length album, stays true to Incubus form. There are moments that call back to their roots, but for the most part, it's a fresh experience. Love it or hate it, you can't deny that it's something you haven't really heard before.<br /><br />Sounds Like: Everything you expected and everything you didn't.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- As with all Incubus albums, this one is all about diversity. Music fans from all walks of life can find something to enjoy here.<br /><br />- Brandon's stellar voice has not worn down one bit and Mike's guitar-work just keeps getting bolder and better.<br /><br />- It's not as high-concept as \\"A Crow Left Of The Murder\\" (their previous affair) and in turn, it's far more accessible.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- While the album has an undeniable energy from the get-go, it fades away in the last few songs.<br /><br />Hits: \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off\\" and \\"Light Grenades\\" are vintage Incubus, while \\"Anna Molly,\\" \\"Love Hurts,\\" \\"Dig\\" and \\"Paper Shoes\\" are new, instant classics in their own right.<br /><br />Misses: \\"Earth To Bella\\" (both parts) doesn't do much for me, to be honest, and the second part provides an extremely anti-climactic ending.<br /><br />Future: It's Incubus, so of course it'll get it's share of spins. There may not be any crossover hits here, but it's definitely something we'll be hearing a lot of for the next year.<br /><br />Personally: I love Incubus, always have since \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\" so maybe I'm a bit bias. To me, everything they do is gold. I admire that they always change things up. Their sound is never a stale one, and \\"Light Grenades\\" carries on that tradition. It takes a few spins to fully appreciate, but it's worth it.<br /><br />Best Listened To When: In the mood for something different.Their sound is never a stale one, and \\"Light Grenades\\" carries on that tradition.

B0009MDPYM|2.0|Let me be frank...  half-breeds?  Come on...  What the heck was that about...?  Overall, this movie was blasphemous, graphic, funny at some parts, interesting, and... Catholic.   <br />The major upsides were the fact it had some pretty good \\"cool guy\\" lines every now and then as well as some pretty good visuals, but there were, of course, the downsides of blasphemy, confusing things like \\"half-breeds\\" that I don't recall having any place in even the stories of demons (much less the harbored beliefs), and a few other things...  Props on the cool sounding title though.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I have everything to do with this movie from the film to the music. As everyone knows, Elvis was originally supposed to play John Norman Howard, but that fell through, so Kris came to bat and hence, a true stroke of genius. Although at the time, this mirrored Kris' own life with the boozing, but watching them sing and the story unfold in true concert settings makes this a must have/see flick. The soundtrack has everybody on it writing from Leon Russell to Kenny Loggins to Paul Williams to Barbra herself. It is a fantastic movie and soundtrack.
B000E97X66|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's 1975 concert in London is proof that sheer genius is indeed timeless. This concert, not recorded in the best of circumstances, holds up and sounds just as fresh now as it did back in 1975.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I just bought it and watched Sir George Martin's interview with his son, Giles, on creating the mixture. This is ALL BEATLES! No fillers, no other singers.....it's alternate takes, outtakes, mash/mix.....three songs rolled into one. Amazing the work that went into this! It's The Beatles like you have never heard them before. If you get it just to see how they mixed everything is worth it! Attention to detail, melodies, voices.....what a joy to own.
B000059TEP|5.0|When I first saw the trailers for Ghost, it was marketed like a thriller, but the surprise cam when I realized that it is poignant story filled with relationships that developed between the characters. There is the romantic love between Sam and Molly, the betrayal of Sam by Carl, the friendship between Oda Mae and Sam. Sam was the central point that glued all the characters together. He helped Oda Mae realize the importance of her gift and her heritage from her mother. Sam continued to protect Molly and helped her to move on by telling her that even if he is gone, their love continues because it is with him. Carl gets his just desserts by sinking into the darkness. I definitely did not remember this movie as having too much publicity, but through word-of-mouth it became a blockbuster and definitely rekindled the careers of the Righteous Brothers with the classic \\"Unchained Melody\\", which my parent taught me is not to be called the theme from \\"Ghost\\".
B000FWHVKA|5.0|The Knife is this great electronic band from Sweden. They are very much an electro band. They remind me of Kraftwerk and John Foxx. The vocals are whispered. They float over keyboards lines. A great example is the song \\"Silent Shout.\\" Some other songs have massive beats and more hiphop like vocals. This is a strong album. For more electronic music, this is something to check out.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|I love the idea of this flick. <br /> <br />I really do. <br /> <br />But thats it. <br /> <br />I like the IDEA. <br /> <br />So....you like ships? <br />Rent Pirates of the Caribbean <br /> <br />You like love triangles? <br />Rent Troy <br /> <br />You like movies about finding yourself? <br />Rent The Last Samuari. <br /> <br /> <br />But avoid Titanic.
B000FVQYYK|2.0|I have been a Muse fan for a long time. I was totally into their first record. I saw them play in New York City in 1998. It was a very small show. They seemed to be in the UK magazines that year for a while. With their second album, I forgot about them. It was never released in America. It was a flop. I never heard it really. Their third album was a massive international success. I saw them play a few more times at bigger venues. They were at the main stage at Coachella. After a while this little band I discovered in 1998, was like the biggest UK band of all time. This band that seemed like an alternative to Radiohead was coming into its own. \\"Take A Bow\\" and \\"Starlight\\" seem like great songs, and a continuation where Absolution left off. \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" is more like a heavy metal version of Curtis Mayfield. \\"Map Of The Problematique\\" has shades of The Cure. \\"Assassin\\" is some heavy stuff that has been more appreciated in the past. Muse brings everything to the record. They are a talented bunch. This album is probably a treat to the hardcore fans. But it is not much new. If their last album was their OK Computer, I am not sure this is their Kid A. It's just another refined version of their previous album. I am getting tired of the lame references to science fiction.
0743454529|5.0|i loved this book it was one of the best books i have read in a really long time. I could not put it down. i plan on reading more books by Jodi Picoult. <br />the book had a very incredable ending and was very compelling i recomend anyone this book who is not a big reader because its a book you cant put down.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|The Black Keys have been one of my favorite groups in the past few years. They have taken the two-man approach to exciting moments. They may be the only duo that rivals the White Stripes in a serious way. Like Cream, they are obsessed with early blues. For some reason they have had a million releases and have been on a few different labels. I can't keep up. The quality has always been high. On songs like \\"Just Got To Be\\" and \\"Your Touch\\" they show us that the fire is still there. \\"Your Touch\\" may be one of their best songs. It is simple and powerful. \\"You're The One\\" sounds almost like soft psychedelic rock. It has a lot of space and airy mood. \\"Just A Little Heat\\" has a little Led Zeppelin type riff. \\"Modern Times\\" is another heavy rocker. \\"Black Door\\" and \\"Elevator\\" are amazing songs to end this with. This record contains everything good about this band. They have struck gold once more. I look forward to the show. Magic Potion may refer to the fact that there is something magical about life and music. When things are going great there is a magical feeling in the air. The Black Keys are a band that can capture that energy.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|A good story, great acting, beautful sets, great costumes, special effects.. this movie has it all!<br /><br />It's a clever story.  You sort of know how it will end, but it moves so quickly its always two steps ahead of your ideas on how it all ties up.<br /><br />This movie didn't shake up the box office.  The Oscars will pass it by.  The neglect is not deserved.
B000G73UEU|5.0|Last month, we had that Serge Gainsbourg record, and now we have this. Hal Wilner has been quite for a while. Ten years ago he seemed like he had a tribute album coming out every month. Maybe he was hiding in the UK? Anything this is a movie soundtrack, while the other records are often not visual. Leonard Cohen has been an influential artist. Most of the focus is on his writings and music from the 1960s, but he has been prolific all the way through. The recent Ten Songs album was fairly good. For many people my age, we first heard about Cohen around the time of the first Nick Cave album back in 1984. Cave did a version of \\"Avalanche.\\" Nick Cave is back here doing \\"I'm Your Man\\" and \\"Suzanne.\\" Cave has been a big supporter of his work. Of course other people have joined in the fray. Jarvis Cocker does an interesting version of \\"I Can't Forget.\\" Hall Wilner regulars U2 and Rufus Wainwright show up here too. Beth Orton, Antony, and The Handsome Family bring new excitement. Much of this album was performed live. People tell me I need to see the movie. I will.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|I'm with the consensus on this CD.  It's wonderful to have a new album from LM.  We waited almost ten years for something new!  It's good, but not as good as I hoped for after waiting ten years for it.<br /><br />The only real problem is that it doesn't feel like new music, but rather reminiscent of all her old music.  Certain tracks remind me of The Visit, some remind me of Mask and Mirror, and one even reminds me of God Bless Ye Merry Gentlemen (from Winter Garden).  Though Ancient Muse has a much more Middle-Eastern feel to it than any previous album (she obviously spent a lot of time there), it still feels like an album of reworked old melodies.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; there are some *great* tracks.  Gates of Istanbul, Caravanserai, Kecharitomene and Beneath A Phygian Sky are wonderful pieces of music and the rest are growing on me the more I listen to them.  But...again...the music just doesn't sound new.  For example, The English Ladye And The Knight feels like it's trying to be the next Lady of Shallott (or Prospero's Speech) but just isn't very musical at all.  And the only other disappointing track is Penelope's Song, but that's *only* because it sounds so much like The Dark Night of the Soul (from Mask and Mirror).  Anyone who has not heard Dark Night prior to Penelope's Song would not find it disappointing at all.<br /><br />It's so nice to have LM back with some great new music, even if it doesn't all sound new.  It's still good, but I hope her next effort explores some new territory, or at least retraces the old territories in different ways.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Great holiday movie! Cute, silly, funny, and sweet.<br /><br />Will Ferrell does a good job playing the part of \\"Buddy\\".<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|\\"Light Grenades\\" continues the nice lineage of anomalous work from Incubus. For a band that so embraces experimentation, this album is the latest manifestation of such an inclination. It makes for a nice reminder of how I came to like and appreciate Incubus so much as a band.<br /><br />\\"Light Grenades\\" differs from the band's previous releases in that the album sounds and feels very much like one musical piece. Which makes it their most conceptual album to date in my opinion. Unlike \\"A Crow Left of a Murder\\", \\"Light Grenades\\" does not pinpoint any issues, it doesn't seem to be an album about a particular cause, but of one relfecting on the band's current state in a relaxed, mildly contemplative approach.
B000AU9UYM|1.0|To me, Michael Keaton will always be Batman, even though he is reluctant to accept it. Just as Christopher Reeve will always be Superman. I felt this movie was wrong on so many levels.  1. The fight scene-For a guy who's suppose to know like 50 kinds of Martial Arts, Batman/Christian Bale certainly didn't display it.   2. Lucius Fox-I'm confused here. While Lucius Fox is a quintissential character and some sort of master inventor, how could he be so stupid as not to know Bruce Wayne and Batman are the same person? Also, it seems he was more like Q in the James Bond movies, where as he's basically a Financial Wizard at Wayne Enterprises. Plus, doesn't Batman build his own stuff anyway? Not showing much intelligence for the world's greatest detective.   3. The Vaporizer-The big one on everybody's list. If a machine could vaporize water, wouldn't people be dying right and left anyway?   4. Scarecrow's costume-What a waste. Scarecrow is one of my favorite villians. Why'd they have to ruin him by making him a second hand villian like \\"Firefly\\" or \\"Killer Croc\\" or \\"The Mad Hatter\\"? His costume reminded me of the old CESAR ROMERO JOKER, same concept. Throw on some makeup over a moustache, and boom, instant cheesy supervillian. Only in Scarecrow's case, it's a mask and straightjacket.   5. Repetitious line-\\"It's not the Fear I fear, it's the fear of not being feared\\". How can you have so many different conversations about the same thing? Every 10 minutes, someone was talking about FEAR. \\"Fear this\\" and \\"Fear that.\\" O.K. I get it, Criminals are a Cowardly, Superstitious Lot and in order to fight crime, I need a scary costume.   6. The Batmobile-Enough said.          There's my review. Yes, out of the 1% of raving, lunatic fans I hated this movie. For those of you, blinded by all the hype and thought this movie was the greatest thing since, I don't know, \\"The Janet Jackson incident.\\" I await your criticisms.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie has everything - comedy, drama, love.  It is a must-see and you'll want to watch it over and over.
0375831002|3.0|The Book Thief is narrated by death and centers on a little girl in Germany during World War II.  Even without reading other's reviews, I knew this was going to be an emotional book.  While it was quite long, it was cleverly written and easy to read.<br /><br />Many people have stated this was their favorite read of the year.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for a couple reasons.  One, this was published as a young adult book, but the profanity was beyond ridiculous. I might not have minded one or two instances, but throughout the whole novel... I would not recommend it to a youth. And second, it was just a little bit too long. Several things could have been cut out. It seemed to drag in places, like the neverending story. I guess after having read The Hiding Place, by Corrie Ten Boom, it would be hard to measure up.<br /><br />It was still a great and powerful story.  But instead of recommending The Book Thief, I'd have to recommend The Hiding Place (even more powerful, being a true story).
B000JJRIO8|3.0|I don't mind guest artists coming in and laying down a verse or two to Pac's music. For God's sake please don't change the beats and delete the original artists that sang with him. If you want to sell Pac then dammit keep it Pac. Not this bubble gum BS that has been coming out lately. If you just must remix something of his please put the original track there also. NO MATTER HOW INCOMPLETE IT IS.
B0009LNRLE|5.0|I didn't really know what I was letting myself in for. I'll be honest, I downloaded this album (initially), it wasn't a blind purchase. But if it had been, it would have been quite possibly the best blind purchase I ever made. Having never heard of krautrock prior to hearing this, I was introduced to the genre via this album. And what a way to be introduced to a genre of music! Yeti remains my favourite krautrock album. It's the perfect blend of psychedelic improvisation, driving riffs, moments of catchy pop and all out experimental weirdness.<br /><br />It feels strange to call this album rock, because it feels like so much more than you'd expect from a rock band. Nonetheless, aside from the occasional violin, the instrumentation here comprises rock instruments first and foremost. Catchy riffs and drum beats maintain a sense of accessibilty which a ton of guitar and violin soloing drives forward the improvisational nature of the music. But most important is the overall ambiance and feel of the music. I'm not going to try to describe the feel of the music, you just have to hear it. The songs themselves are a mixture of shorter composed pieces and longer jams. The title track itself weighs in at 18 minutes and sounds almost wholly improvised.<br /><br />If you're looking to get into Amon Duul II or krautrock in general, or just want to hear an incredible, psychedelic rock album then you need Yeti. It's a great piece of work that never fails to captivate me. I've heard other Amon Duul II albums besides Yeti and other krautrock bands besides Amon Duul II and they've all been great, but Yeti remains my favourite.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|It's only been a mere 2 years since a full length Incubus CD has hit shelves, and only a year since we got three new tracks thanks to the Stealth soundtrack, but somehow it felt like it's been forever. However they have not missed a single beat. This is a version of Incubus that doesn't single any single fan out. If you loved S.C.I.E.N.C.E. there's a few tracks here that are just calling your name (A Kiss To Send Us Off, Light Grenades, Rogues). If you liked Make Yourself and Morning View, a good portion of Light Grenades is for you. And then there's the seemingly few of us who loved A Crow Left Of The Murder as well. They still have that 'sound' and a few songs call back to it successfully (Love Hurts, Oil And Water, Paper Shoes). As much as this CD beckons back to those days, it's still easily identifiable that they grew a lot and have certainly evolved so Light Grenades serves as it's own CD as well.<br /><br />If it was even possible, Incubus sounds as good as ever. Brandon still proves to be one of the elite few who sounds good in everything he does. Mike finds a way to better himself even after that awe-inspiring solo on Sick Sad Little World. Jose has more great beats in store. Ben offers up some truly catchy bass lines. And Kilmore actually serves a fairly big part this time around(!). So if you've been a longtime fan then your appreciation for them is only going to grow, and heck, if you're new they welcome new listeners with open arms.<br /><br />From the very beginning it's obvious that Incubus took their time crafting Light Grenades to have an excellent flow. Quicksand flows into A Kiss To Send Us Off like no other track they've ever made. From there they don't stop. The almost overwhelming heaviness of songs like Light Grenades and Rogues are something I didn't expect but they fit perfectly. A Kiss To Send Us Off and Rogues are also more in the hard rock variety, both serving as true highlights. The mid-tempo songs like Dig, Anna Molly, Oil And Water, Diamonds And Coal, and Paper Shoes keep the pace going swiftly and aren't without Incubus' now trademark lyrical prowess. With this being Incubus you know the slow songs included such as Quicksand, Love Hurts, and Earth To Bella parts I and II aren't going to drag down the overall listen either. What's really nice about Incubus is the fact that they have so much emotion in each track without it being overbearing and unwelcomed.<br /><br />My favorite songs are A Kiss To Send Us Off, Dig, Light Grenades, Earth To Bella (I and II), and Pendulous Threads. I was lucky enough to have gotten my copy a few days before the release date so I've heard Light Grenades countless times already and I've still yet to find a song I don't completely love. If that's a testament to how good the band is, or how good the CD is, I don't know, but this is sure to be in the ol' CD player for a good long time. Past that, if Incubus has even piqued your interest in the least Light Grenades is going to be chock full of everything you'd ever want. As an addition, I may be in the minority on this, but I think we just found our `CD of the year'.r, Diamonds And Coal, and Paper Shoes keep the pace going swiftly and aren't without Incubus' now trademark lyrical prowess.

0446528056|5.0|Nobody writes a romance novel like Nicholas Sparks.  His descriptions of people falling in love are like no others and he deserves to have his books as #1 on the best-seller list.  In this latest book he chronicles the love affair of John Tyree, a soldier on leave from the Army, and Savannah Curtis, a college girl who is building Habitat houses as a summer volunteer.  John has a non-communicative father who is only interested in coin collecting, while Savannah's parents dote on her.  John has little direction in life and enters the army as a last resort while Savannah has a clear goal of earning a degree in psychology and working with children.  While they are together during John's leave from the army their romance sizzles, but eventually time, distance, and world events make their relationship more difficult.  This book is all about commitment, and learning to love in a selfless way.  Nicholas Sparks writes love stories with bittersweet endings which are nevertheless memorable.
B000GYI32M|3.0|i enjoyed it. but i wasnt expecting the world from the o.c. the story likes are a tad hookie but the acting isnt horrible. all in all a decent attempt
B000HA4WT8|2.0|If you're looking for drifting, don't buy this movie. Get Initial D the live action instead. The hilarity in this movie is nonstop, from the terrible acting of the lead dude, apparently giving someone a southern accent is an excuse for them to be stupid, to the unrealistic situations and terrible dialog. Situations illustrating the previous flaws follow in synopses: Main character's mom (who, by the way is about 5 yrs older than him)-\\"I told you no more street racing, I'm sending you to Japan to live with your father, I'd rather spend thousands of dollars than just throw you out of the house.\\" The poor kid from Home Improvement, I bet he never thought his career would include a spoiled teenager wrecking daddy's viper. I knew I was in for a funny movie with the Home improvement kid's girlfriend saying \\"Why don't you guys race and whoever wins, gets me.\\" Oh, and did you know Bow Wow could act? Neither did I, and I still don't. It did remind me of fond High School memories of \\"drifting\\" up a mountain road and telling my future girlfriend my life story while tackling corners and getting good angle. Yes, that is included in the film. Please, don't bother, don't even rent it, unless you can get it free. I suspect the actors paid the filmmakers to be in the movie because I've seen Jr High Drama students with far better ability. I missed a lot of the movie due to persistant eye-rolling, a side effect that should be listed on the outside of the box. Cool cars worth 2 stars.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall. One of Pink Floyd's best known works (aside from Dark Side of the Moon), and the only rock opera I can think of with a semi-coherent plot, is definitely worth the price, and more. I am listening to it right now, in fact. Although few songs stand out from the rest in terms of absolute greatness, the work functions as a whole, with the songs within sides (on the original record) flowing into each other with no pause whatsoever. Any classic rock fan should own this, and anyone wishing to get into Pink Floyd should see this first or second, along with Dark Side of the Moon. This is an album that will be remembered for years to come.
B000J10ERO|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this movie since it didn't have Chris Reeve in it, but I found myself really enjoying it. I really think Singer did a great job casting Brandon for the role and I think Brandon did a great Job in preparing for this role.  There were so many of Reeve's Manerisms that I picked up, and it was obvious that he did his homework.   <br /> <br />Casting Kate as Lois was a little iffy but she did a good job as well and I'm sorry to all you die hard Fans of the first two but I never could get into Margot Kidder's version of Lois Lane.  She was okay but she screamed too much, granted some of that stuff was scarry but every time she screamed I wanted to leave the room.   <br /> <br />The age difference from the first two to this one seems like they did jump back a few years and that part wasn't explained very well.  I do believe that they would have done better to give us some sort of time Line as well as what their ages were supposed to be.  When Superman first came on the seen 12 of his years passed making him in his early thirties, correct me if I'm wrong but if this is five years later, well that was one inconsistancy but I'm not going to hate it because of that.   <br /> <br />This movie was very fun, and casting Tristan to play that role was a great choose.  I got why they did it, he had never been in anything before and so he could act without it being schooled, if that makes any since.  <br /> <br />Only part I really didn't like was Superman getting beat up, but other than that I give it the 5 stars that it needs.   <br /> <br />Ella

B000JBXXZ4|5.0|If I may refer to a previous review by Cale E Reneau, he said that this album is lighter than \\"Morning View\\". What a moron! He needs to be punched in the face. There isn't a song on \\"Morning View\\" that compares to the kinetic energy that half of \\"Light Grenades\\" has!! The only thing I will agree on is that \\"Earth To Bella\\" does seem like filler. Especially broken into 2 parts. I understand he was going for a high and low feel but I am still on the fence. <br />Other than that, this musical endeavor shines brightly!! I won't bore with reviews of each song since every other review has done so. The high energy tracks are \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off\\", \\"Anna Molly\\", \\"Light Grenades\\" (which is way too short for me!! Could of listened to another 2 minutes of that song!), \\"Rogues\\" (which is absolutely frenetic visceral fun!), and \\"Pendulous Threads\\" (more heart pounding pleasure!) All of the other tracks sparkle in their own special way, while \\"Paper Shoes\\" may be the lynch pin that releases the explosive power that is Light Grenades. To steal the words of Brandon..\\"If your not affected, your not paying attention\\"..........
B000JJS8TM|5.0|My daughter is only 5, but she is already a Beatles fan and has been for as long as she can remember. At age 3, we started her on the movie Yellow Submarine, and moved on from there. She can recognize and name each of the Beatles, and in many cases can even tell who's singing which song. So it came as no surprise to me that she liked the \\"newest\\" Beatles release, Love. <br /> <br />Our first listening was in the living room, together. \\"I heard Sgt. Pepper!\\" my daughter squealed delightedly. And so did I, for a moment. As well as any number of snippets from countless other songs, all mixed together as smoothly as one of 007's martinis. I listened in awe, and in horror, at what I was hearing...  Here were the Beatles, the beloved icons of my childhood, lurching back to life, resurrected by a pair of mad geniuses who don't realize that what they've done approaches blasphemy. <br /> <br />Sir George Martin, and his son Giles Martin have assembled a real Frankenstein's monster here. Shards and fragments of my favorite songs have been unnaturally sewn together, against what ought to be all laws of propriety. The result is upsetting, eye-opening, and nothing short of brilliant. These guys should be hanged, or Knighted. Oh, wait-- Baron Victor von Martin has already been Knighted. Perhaps it's time for all of us to polish up our pitchforks and storm Abbey Road Studios demanding his head. <br /> <br />There are some real gems here. It starts off simply, with an a capella rendering of Because, and ending, perhaps appropriately, with All You Need Is Love. In between those are 24 others that range from the un-retouched, early days of Beatlemania (I Want To Hold Your Hand) to heavily re-mixed, swan songs from Abbey Road (e.g. Something, Octopus's Garden, Here Comes The Sun, and Come Together). One of the many revelations on this album results from the conjoining of two songs that never really seemed part of the Beatles \\"A\\" catalog-- Within You Without You and Tomorrow Never Knows. The result, far from the train wreck that one might expect, is a truly compelling composition that I couldn't disengage from. <br /> <br />I saw an excerpt from another reviewer's comments about this album, in which he likened it to \\"rummaging through your father's closet\\". That's fair, but to me it seemed more like coming home to find my daughter has rummaged through *my* closet, leaving all my treasures strewn across the floor. Not broken, just... touched. One wonders how much of this monster was Giles' idea, and whether his father came to work one day to find his favorite things strewn across the studio floor. So it goes with children and treasure chests. <br /> <br />My daughter doesn't yet realize, or hasn't yet been told that the Beatles aren't all still with us... To her, they're all vibrant and real... they all look like they did in Yellow Submarine, eternally young. And to tell the truth, after listening to Love with her, I think I see her point. <br />
1567184855|5.0|When someone recommended this book to me, I was hesitant, at best, and assumed it would be filled with sensationalist psycho-babble. Nevertheless, his sincerity and rave reviews were enough for me to suspend my disbelief and give it a chance, which proved to be a life-altering decision. This book is fantastic, it resonated with me on a level I didn't know existed. It made me excited about life, excited about death, and most importantly, excited about all the opportunities we have to create the lives we'd like to live, and be the people we're truly capable of being. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. When you release your fear of death, you begin to really live.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|Ok, I'll say it. This is the best science fiction film of all time. Read the other reviews for details. its as much a showcase for 1950s culture as it is a scifi movie. Heavily influential. The giant underground architecture of the Krell is fantastic!! The space suits were later used by Rod Serling on the Twilight Zone. Also, this was the spaceship Agnes Moorehead destroyed in the \\"Invaders\\" TZ episode. I could go on. Just do yourself a favor and go out and buy it. You WILL watch it more than once, guaranteed.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I had no idea this movie was based on a video game.  It is absolutely the most bizarre and visually disturbing movie I have watched since Jacob's Ladder.  I will probably check out the video game after seeing this.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because of the barely there plot.  It seemed like the movie was just hell bent on cramming in as much SFX as possible.  The scene with the nurses towards the end of the film was really spooky.  I would never be able to pass through them.
B000MV9026|5.0|I'm a sucker for penguins. When I saw the previews for HAPPY FEET, I knew that it would be a movie I was going to see, for better or for worse. Despite Robin Williams' voicing several characters, I was leery at first and thought the film might just turn out to be another lame animated animal movie. This wasn't the case.<br /><br />HAPPY FEET begins in Antarctica at the meeting of two Emperor penguins, a soul-singing baritone named Memphis (Hugh Jackman) who sounds and acts like Elvis and a sweet-voiced earth angel named Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman). In this group of Emperor penguins, soul mates find each other through the heart songs that they sing. Some melodies just don't sound good together. Memphis and Norma Jean meet and have an egg. Norma Jean leaves with the females to get food before the winter ends and Memphis stays behind keeping guard and warming the egg until it should hatch in the spring. During the longest night of the year as the male penguins huddle together walking in a massive circle, Memphis drops his egg while walking on the outside. He is able to rescue the egg, but the accident hurts him to his core. During the spring thaw, the egg hatches. It is a fine baby boy, but one who can't sing but can dance better than Fred Astaire. Norma Jean returns and for a time things are alright. But as their son, Mumble (Elijah Wood) grows up it is quite clear that he is different from everyone, not only can he not sing and wants to dance, but even in adulthood his body is partially covered in feathers and his eyes are brilliant blue instead of the normal black penguin eyes. After being outcasted, Mumble sets out on an adventure of his own. He makes some new friends, meets some fascinating creatures, and ends up discovering the mystery of the disappearing fish.<br /><br />The movie has a great vocal cast. Hugh Jackman continues to illustrate why he will soon be the #1 actor in America--his talent seems to have no limits. Nicole Kidman gives Norma Jean the homey sensuality that recalls the famous actress of her name sake. Elijah Wood, no doubt using his LORD OF THE RINGS experiences, seems perfect as Mumble and Brittany Murphy surprises as Mumble's love, Gloria. Robin Williams serves as the comic relief of the movie portraying not just one, but three different characters. Williams is gifted as a voice actor and does his job well (I just wish he would go make to making good live-action movies again).<br /><br />When I saw the original trailers for HAPPY FEET, I thought the movie was going to be about dancing penguins. As it turns out, most of the movie is about singing penguins. In fact, the movie is basically a modern musical; there isn't much original music but instead various popular tunes and some not-so-popular ones are used as the music that moves these flightless birds. For most of the movie scenes move from one major song to the next one, interlaced with some dialogue and humorous visual effects.<br /><br />Speaking of visuals, the animation in the movie is amazing. The penguins look unbelievably realistic. They seem as real as some of the living, breathing penguins you might see in a zoo. There are also some moments later in the movie where the animation is perfectly blended with live action footage of people. I honestly was unable to tell for sure what was live footage and what was animated.<br /><br />Though the movie relies upon some formulaic devices and storylines, HAPPY FEET isn't a typical animated feature. The major message of the movie has to do with living a life of difference and integrity. There are parts of the film that can be viewed as being a religion satire, a political commentary, or perhaps a little of both. The film doesn't take sides with either a conservative or liberal point of view and the religious element serves more as prodding not to abandon belief, but to not disengage one's intellect in worship.<br /><br />HAPPY FEET doesn't gloss over the dangers that are apparent in life. There are a group of birds who attempt to rip Mumble apart when he is still a child. There are other seals that attempt to eat the penguins as well as a couple of orcas who almost succeed in devouring Mumble and one of his friends while they are on their quest. In this sense, HAPPY FEET more resembles a classical fairy tale of folk story in that it doesn't gloss over the dangers that naturally happen in living life.<br /><br />HAPPY FEET is one of the two best animated movies of 2006. It's a very different movie than the other best animated film of 2006 (CARS). However, it does what it does extremely well. Besides, it's got a bunch of singing and dancing penguins. They're just so darn cute, it's hard to resist.oup of birds who attempt to rip Mumble apart when he is still a child.

B00004R99U|3.0|I don't see why everyone who didn't like the movie is getting so bent out of shape over Pocahontas choosing John Rolfe. That's the way it is supposed to end. Don't get me wrong, I love the first one, but in history Pocahontas was like thirteen when she met the thirty-ish John Smith. She did not fall in love with him.  I was disappointed about the way they ended it though. It wasn't dramatic enough for me. It kind of seemed like she was settling for John Rolfe, when in fact she was in love with him. Oh well if I had to choose between Mel Gibson and Billy Zane I might have a difficult time too.
0307237699|5.0|As I closed the last few pages of this book for the second time I pondered what I should say.  Once again I'm left with the impression that Barack is as authentic and real as he is driven and inspired. <br /> <br />His books convince you that he is imperfect with an imperfect family, but that he embraces his past and doesn't try to hide from it.  Instead he ponders the meanings of the events in his life and attempts to learn and grow from them.  ...Very smart. <br /> <br />I also especially appreciated reading about life on the inside in Washington.  In the end I think this book will leave the reader thinking of Barack more as a neighbor then a politician. <br /> <br />BTW: I highly recommend reading Barack's other book, it added some context that I really appreciated the second time around.  <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Finially, an intelligent and mature version...great acting by all, especially Bale and Caine....I have seen it ten times already.  This is by FAR the best of all of them....Supeman, Hulk, Spideman, all great in their own right, but this one is the most realistic, and the atmosphere absolutely made the movie!  ...very well done, and it just flowed....believable to the max......I can't wait to see another sequel like this one....this is a classic that is made for adults.  You got it Perfect!  Thanks!!, and more please just like this.  This is the way to make them!
B000ICLHIE|4.0|While on some songs, Tom's voice is a little harsh and an acquired taste, most of the time it is heartwrenching and/or rockin'. And it usually adds to his clever songwriting and sturdy but raw songs. A couple songs, like \\"Lucinda\\" seem a little creative only for creativity's sake, but there's no arguing that Tom's creative drive often hits the mark. Alice is a good CD, but this is a better start IMO as it shows his multiple sides.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Brandon once promised that A Crow Left Of The Murder would be like \\"melted choclate on your chest and neck.\\" To many an Incubus faithful, this didn't hold up. The \\"old stuff, but older\\" feel didn't work the way we wanted it to. It didn't sound like warm, melty chocolate. It was original, but it wasn't ground-breaking. It wasn't a cocoon of awesome. And it made me sad. <br /> <br />Here In My Room was the one-off: The gorgeous, extemporaneous exploration into piano that Mike would sit playing, with a pick in his mouth, because he's just that awesome and about to start on the guitar solo. Nothing else compared. <br /> <br />But that was then. And Light Grenades is now. <br /> <br />Incubus is an incredible group. Every album has a different flavor, and a different feel. Each song is its own invention, its own destination and each album, the journey. Very, very few bands accomplish this. Fewer still make you pine for more, year after year. Incubus is the quintessential, \\"professional awesome,\\" in spades. They've evolved with their listeners, they've shown their own brilliant growth and they've truly gotten better with age. <br /> <br />Quicksand will throw you for a loop as a starting track. It possesses a milquetoast, somber 2:14 look at piano, faded guitar and staple Brandon vocals. <br /> <br />A Kiss To Send Us Off starts with a callback to Final Countdown by Europe. Albeit not intentionally, we'd like to think. It combines a bit of a grunge-feeling intro with a melodic, driven verse. It breaks down into a beautiful, deep bridge that blends back into the chorus perfectly. <br /> <br />Dig is my absolute favorite on the track. It is deep, its message is spot-on, and it gets inside your head, in the best of ways: <br />\\"If I turn into another, <br />Dig me up from under what is covering... <br />The better part of me. <br />Sing this song, remind me that we'll always have each other... <br />When everything else is gone.\\" <br />Its sound is new for Incubus in a way that only Incubus can reinvent themselves. Its melody will resound with you, the dual electric-acoustic guitar, with even more piano laid over it will engulf you. It's truly gorgeous piece. It's more substantial than Here In My Room, or Aqueous Transmission, but it still maintains that ethereal, purely beautiful quality to it. <br /> <br />Anna Molly is one you should be well familiar with by now, as it's the first single from the track. I was fortunate to hear it back in September, when they played here in Tempe. (I believe it was the first stateside performance in 2+ years for them.) It's an interesting song, but it started to wear on me, through the verse, at least. I'm not sure why, but the lick Mike plays bugs me just a bit. The chorus is great and driven and I love the bridge build up. <br /> <br />Love Hurts. It's true. More genius guitar work from Mike. Mike's fantastic in a way that few other guitarists are. He re-invents himself, he makes careful use of a well-selected array of pedals, but he never over-uses any effects. He seems to have the most perfect ear for how he wants to make his guitar sound, and he speaks and it is so. So much flexibility lives in Mike's execution, and it's why you'll never tire of listening to Incubus' entire catalog from SCIENCE to Make Yourself to Morning View to ACLOTM through Light Grenades. I'm not sure how someone grows from \\"amazing guitarist\\" but Mike continues to wow with every new piece. And I tip my hat to that--a constant exercise in incredible creativity, perfect execution and sublime, flowing-over-you-warm-and-tingly music. <br /> <br />Light Grenades: Welcome back to grunge. Incubus always had their roots in some crazy funk-grunge blendings. Enjoy and Fungus show this in spades, and Light Grenades reminds you where they came from. It's tight, it's fast, it's just what you need in the middle of the soft. <br /> <br />Earth To Bella (I) surprises. It starts acoustic, but quickly takes a turn at the chorus. It's not myfavorite, but the chorus and the light... is that an accordion in the background? It works. And I love them for it. Also, kudos to Ben for churning out fantastic background vocals.  <br /> <br />Oil and Water, more Mike, more unfettered greatness. I love that each song Incubus produces is a complete thought. It's what you expect when you put a group of absolute professionals who are in love with what they do in a room for a few hours. It's that you can see the look on their faces as they built the song, watching things fall into place and catching each and every piece as it came tumbling right where it belongs. A catchy chorus, another good story told, and more of what you love. <br /> <br />Diamonds and Coal. One of these come from the other, and you'll get that through by the end. Though a bit repetitive, you'll start to appreciate it. You won't find people layering two Incubus songs on top of each other to ill-effect. Every track is different. Every song a certain shade of... <br /> <br />Rogues reinforces a bizarre concept becoming more and more clear throughout the cd: Mike wants another guitarist in the band. I'm curious to see how a few of these tracks execute live. It's a *bit* grunge, but it's so post-modern, you'll love it right out of the gate. Brandon has intensity that draws you in, and you'll find yourself surrendering, just like to the rest of the CD. <br /> <br />Paper Shoes, size 9, and more acoustic. Jose keeps it fresh and fast, and you'll really appreciate it. More beauty, rather like a bubble bath. Let yourself get wet, kick off your paper shoes. <br /> <br />Pendulous Threads builds for a solid minute into a heap of suspense that pulls through, like a rocket out of the pull of earth. Free of all that noisy atmosphere, watch what happens. Beautiful vocals, claps, and a slight tinge of Minus the Bear, I swear. The chorus is positively SCIENCE-lite, and you'll love it. <br /> <br />Our last stop, at least for the next few years, is Earth to Bella(II). I dig the chorus... The harmonies are fantastic and it feels like the right way to go out-not with a bang, but with a long, drawn out exhale. The pin's been put back in, breath easy, let Mike do his thing, and watch them live. It'll be the best concert you'll go to.
0440180295|5.0|Yup.  This is one bizarre book.  And I loved it!<br /><br />It's very hard to describe the surreal feeling one has when reading Slaughterhouse 5.  You see, Billy Pilgrim is dead. (So it goes.) And he is alive. He exists at all times in his life at the same moment. He can relive them over and over. If he wants to see the bombing of Dresden again, or be a P.O.W. again he can do it.  It he wants to re-live his plane crash, his birth, or his visits with the strange writer in the alley he can do that. He can even go back into space to the time he was abducted by aliens and forced to live in a zoo aquarium with a famous actress. And if Billy gets Bored, he can go and be dead and listen to the light hum, and see the violet lights. So it goes.<br /><br />Yes, there is really no other book like it, yet deep, and even in some places not so deep, there is a rich subtext to Billy's life.  It is a sad, yet beautiful tale, and at the end of the book the first thing I did was flip back to page 1, because, just like Billy, I had some moments I wanted to re-live again.  And you will to.<br /><br />Relic113
B0009QTS1M|5.0|This film achieves Ridley Scott's goal of portraying the Roman time period and the gladiator's plight in stunning fashion.  With the combination of a captivating plot, marvelous acting, and second to none special effects, Gladiator shines as one of the best films recently produced.   <br />The placement of actors and their performance in this movie is nearly perfect. Russell Crowe is captivating from the very start, and his character's homely attributes make him nearly impossible to dislike.  The character is simultaneously filled with many emotions such as anger, passion, bravery, and loneliness.  Crowe exhibits the qualities needed to perform in this type of role.  Phoenix, in addition, portrays the desired effect through his character with flying colors. The character, along with Phoenix's one of a kind touch makes Commodus create a sense of disgust in the viewer. <br />   <br />The historical aspect of the movie, in my opinion, is very well done. Though it may not be completely accurate, it illustrates the grandeur of the Roman Empire magnificently and creates a good balance between history and Hollywood.  The plot is filled with passion and the classic themes of freedom and the power in people.  The action sequences in the movie are great with nearly uncensored views of the bloody life a Roman gladiator. <br />  <br />The film has something for everyone from the action film junkie to someone who enjoys quality artistic expression. Ridley Scott achieves a nearly perfect balance between having to sell in the box office while still attempting to be as historically accurate as possible. I would recommend this film to everyone. <br /> <br />BB
B000HEWEEY|5.0|Forbidden Planet is an incredible movie and no Sci-Fi fan should be without it.  The transfer on the 50th Anniversary and Ultimate Collector's  Editions is incredible.  I've never seen the film look so bright, crisp and vibrant.  The included documentaries and bonus footage are very entertaining and not to be missed.<br /><br />A word of warning though, the Ultimate Collector's Edition is a bit of a rip off.  The included Robby the Robot toy was the main reason I bought this set and it's much smaller (and less detailed) than the images lead you to believe.  I haven't opened mine, but it looks like it's not even articulated.  Definitely not worth the extra money I had to pay.  The lobby card reporductions are nice, as is the tin case, but unless you plan to display these it's hard to justify the added cost.<br /><br />Be smart, skip the Ultimate Collector's Edition and buy the 50th Anniversary Edition.  You'll get just the exact same transfer and bonus material without the cheap toy and lobby cards.
B0000640RX|5.0|No one could have played the part of Rambo better than Sylvester Stallone. He fits the profile of an invincible soldier perfectly: his war-trained, war-stricken , ripped-out body; his serious, aggressive, and somber disposition; and his reputation of being a hardcore action-packer. If Stallone alone isn't enough to draw you to the movie, the action contained within is. From crashing helicopters, to explosive arrows fired from his compound bow, to highly explosive napalm bombs, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. A single viewing will not be enough once you have seen the series once. Inevitably you will want to see it again, so I recommend purchasing it.

B000ICL3CO|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing album <br />When I bought it, I had no idea that 'Hey You!' had not been on the original album <br />I'm certainly glad it is on this version, however <br />It's a great song, quite poppy, and is arranged more simply, like earlier Cure, but has great horn parts over its basis <br />The Snakepit, while a bit slow and perhaps unnecessary, is certainly one of my favorite track of the album <br />Mostly in how it doesn't fit with itself, and yet it manages not to collapse at any point <br />Sure, it goes nowhere at all, it just lumbers along, but it works <br />It's done well as what it is, and nothing else <br />Songs like 'Why Can't I Be You?', 'Hot Hot Hot!!!', 'The Perfect Girl', and 'Just Like Heaven' are obvious pop concoctions, and every one of them is great for listening anytime <br />The style of music on here is quite varied, unlike something like Disintegration which stays in the same style all the time <br />Anyone who likes The Cure must have this album, whether in this version, its original Hey You!-less version, or its two-disc release
0517147688|5.0|This was a great book for the price and everything. It is fantastically layed out, and the pages are thin but no so much that you fear they will tear every time you turn the page. I was hesitant with the five starts only because there are SEVERAL typos throughout the book, which worried me a little as to the correctness of other points. But it is a very attractive book that includes a bookmark and very well worth the price. I would highly recommend this anthology over many others. Be on guard for the typos, however.

I can't empathize with either side. Too gross.
B000INAXGU|5.0|If you are like me, your first exposure to Jamiroquai may have been something along the lines of 'WTF with the crazy buffalo hat'? Other acceptable associations are: 'nice voice', 'wow, my chick really loves this album' and 'sounds like disco'. As Jamiroquai grew on me, I think the initial phase of my acceptance was one of the more interesting - reconciling their popularity and style as an offshoot to rave culture (via acid jazz), yet their organic vibe and funk simply defied the rigid constraints of popular dance music in the early 90s. <br /> <br />Through the years, Jamiroquai have proven themselves as a band capable of longevity by evolving in a very fluid fashion. Always an outfit with a intensely distinctive sound, they have drifted unapologetically between various production styles and modes of songwriting all while being respectful of the essence that garnered them a strong following in the first place. What this best of really highlights is a band that started out with a groovy pimp strut and only continues to gain confidence in their walk over the years. <br /> <br />Face it, if you don't dig what they're about, I'm not going to change your mind. As with any artist, there are points of critique that could be lobbied but the idea is that any one of the songs off this album, when juxtaposed well with a similar song by a soul, funk or disco contemporary, is going to hold its own: this is a great compliment to your party mix on shuffle in other words. \\"High Times\\" definitely nails the focus of what Jamiroquai does - bouncy, funky, fun music that sounds genuinely inspired. It's a great springboard to the rest of their collection as well: if you happen to find yourself drawn to one era or another via a song on this album, you are going to know exactly where to start. <br /> <br />By the way, the two previously unreleased tracks, \\"Runaway\\" and \\"Radio\\" are sure to please, both are class tracks that compliment the rest of this collection well. . . I'm just loving \\"Radio\\" in particular, great turnaround hook in the chorus and rock-funk movement of the track is sweet. <br /> <br />In conclusion, my hope is that a similarly well thought out collection of remixes is released on CD as a compliment, seems like a remix best of could fill two discs easily.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|...in two lousy hours, as another reviwer says earlier? Well, here it goes. Bur durdle dur dur dur durrrr dur...\\"Hello I'm Johnny Cash and I'm gonna propose marriage to my duet partner onstage during a performance of a song so lame neither of us would touch it solo, so we do a duet\\". Did he actually propose to June in that way and finally get a yes?. \\"Now I'm gonna go onstage so smashed that I pass out. My doctors call my condition acute wahfloompia. All of a sudden the sufferer goes waaaaah...floomp.\\" Well, that's an exaggeration, but the way this flick trivializes Johnny Cash's life story is almost that bad. Johnny once told interviewers that he was part of the Rockabilly sub-genre, so called because they were \\"rockin' hillbillies\\", and that faction also included Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and a few others. It's easy to assume that Elvis was the king of that bunch, and this movie does go a long way towards dispelling that myth. Johnny was the most powerful songwriter of that group, with his Leadbelly-esque compostional style of chronicling hard times. But that's either touched upon lightly or just plain implied and it takes a Cash fan to spot it. Otherwise, for all of its semi-noir approach, this film approaches Cash's life in a rather superficial way. I don't doubt that we'll be seeing it on ABC some night. That's not a compliment.
0066620996|5.0|Good to Great is a book for anyone that has high aspirations to succeed in life.  The author Jim Collins takes five years of research and puts it into an inspiring and useful book.  I would recommend this book to anyone from college students to CEOs.  As a college student at Oklahoma State University, it challenged me to become a \\"level 5 leader\\" and to \\"rinse my cottage cheese.\\"  Collins allowed me to re-think my conventional ideas of how a company can go from good to great.  It also enhanced my understanding of how a company can go from good to great.  I would consider this book to be one of the best reads of my lifetime.

B000JJS8TM|3.0|\\"Love\\" is mostly a souvenir of a Las Vegas up-scale \\"BeatleMania\\" with the so-called prestige of a Circ du Soli-ugh. Queen has one  Abba has one  Elton John has one  hell, Barry Manilow has one,  why not Beatles?!? This is not a review of the LV extravaganza. Pay your money  take your chance on that.... <br /> <br />\\"Love\\" is a mash up of Beatle songs edited and re-evolved especially for the LV show. George Martin, the producer for the Beatles, is the one responsible.  As a mash-up,not bad  but clearly done for the LV and pre-Broadway show. Elbow nudgers for tickets won't care  they just want seats. Beatle lovers may be appalled.  <br /> <br />The real interest here is the 5.1 DVD available.  <br /> <br />When the first Beatle Cds were available, they were issued in Mono. George Martin, the producer, said that is the best sound. Then,the first albums were re-issued in stereo on CD,as were the next 4. Meanwhile, Yellow Submarine was issued on DVD with tracks in 5.1, then, Hard Days Night was issued on DVD with tracks in 5.1. <br /> <br />Now, this \\"Love\\" mash-up of tracks in 5.1.  <br />The sound and separation is sublime, particularly when allowed to finish a song i.e. Come Together   Revolution  Hey Jude    <br /> <br />\\"Love\\" is a gimmick, not worthy of a regular CD. But \\"Love\\" is also an indication of what 5.1 can do. Loud and sweet   nothing better!!Too bad one can't just buy the DVD A. alone.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Too many movies today consist of 2 dimentional cartoon characters.  Rarely does a film come along that has real humans facing real issues with real depth.   I found that in \\"Good Will Hunting\\".  I have just found it in \\"Finding Forrester\\".    The characters are not as deep or as compelling as Good Will BUT nonetheless they are better than 99% of what Hollywood puts out.   I would highly recommend to those who are not in the mood for shallow characters and over the top special effects. <br /> <br />Highly recommend.
B000EGF0NW|5.0|There are not many writers who can be extremely talented fiction AND non-fiction writers.  So even though I had read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" and knew Alice Sebold to be an extremely gifted storyteller, I hesitated to take up \\"Lucky\\".  It was non-fiction and moreover, autobiographical, and moreover, documents a personal tragedy.  With all due respect, and without diminishing the seriousness of the subject, I wasn't sure I would be able to stick with it to the end. <br /> <br />Well, I certainly did stick with it to the end; if you liked \\"The Lovely Bones\\" reading this will help you understand how she was able to bring haunting and heartbreaking life to the characters in that book.  She tells her story brilliantly.  I recommend this book without reservation.

0743455967|5.0|This book was a lot better than I thought it would be.  I just happened to pass by it while browsing through Amazon about a year ago.  I got it for Christmas last year and didn't pick it up until a couple weeks ago.  I expected it to be a slow read at first, as most technical books are.  But King does a great job and moving you through the ideas and concepts.  There is much more story telling in there than one might suspect.<br /><br />It's great for writers of any caliber.  He's straightforward with what works (in his opinion) and what does not.  He's realistic about expectations.<br /><br />I'm not a big King fan.  I can't think of much of his I've ever read.  Nowhere near the entire catalogue of work.  But I know he's considered one of the few greats in the literary world today, at least in terms of cash flow if not in literary originality.  This read has credibility behind it.  They guy has been there and knows what he's talking about.

B000FQ4M58|5.0|I hesitated to buy this album initially, even though I am a long time MAJOR Meat Loaf fan. The samples that music providers like amazon provide are so-so at best, and some of the earlier reviews were iffy. I have tried many times in the past to go to a concert unsuccesfully, but made it to his recent tour. He played several of the songs from this album. The title track, Bad for Good, If it ain't broke, and Blind as a Bat. This was enough to make up my mind to buy it. Like alot of Meat Loaf songs, you've got to listen to them more than once to get them. This album is no different.  <br /> <br />On this album, Meat has several songs that are good solid rock songs.  <br /> <br />The rest are Meat Loaf in his true form. Theatrical, a little over the top, and dripping with passion. Great singing guitar riffs, great piano chords, and phenomenal vocals. Songs that tell a story so strongly that the listener can feel the emotion. If you like Meat Loaf, you will love this album.

B000FKO0Q0|5.0|I love this film and both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones' portrayals within it.  Most are familiar with the story: a Chicago-based vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kincaid (Ford) returns home to find an intruder and his wife nearly dead from the attack. The CPD cannot substantiate the story and believe the good doctor murdered his wife instead.  Dr. Kincaid is sentenced to death by lethal injection due to the particularly heinous nature of the crime. He gets a lucky break when the inmates on his prisoner transport break out.  Instead of running for the border, Dr. Kincaid returns to Chicago to find the person who killed his wife.  U. S. Marshal Sam Girard is assigned to the case---Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal in this particular film was what spawned his role in \\"US Marshals\\" another case where he ends up proving the innocence of the person he is seeking.

We go on to see the 50ish widow her father is dating lying about her age and ending up with a 15 year old (oh yes, he lied about his age, too) on her doorstep claiming they were soulmates.  Well, they did have some interesting things in common.  Add to that the crying neurotic guy, the 50ish guy who really wanted an 18 year old, etc.  The movie itself lacked the timing or style to be anything but a 'dog' and the advert for the online dating service just sealed the deal for me.

B000K26AHK|5.0|I saw this movie, kicking and screaming, when my younger sister foisted it upon me. Thinking that it was going to be another Gen X piece of claptrap, I gritted my teeth and prepared myself for what I erroneously thought would be a waste of time. Was I ever wrong! It turned out to be a sublime cinematic experience.<br /><br />Renee Zellweger is definitely the star of this film. She positively twinkles! She is absolutely marvelous in the role of Bridget Jones, our single, thirty something, English Holly-Go-Lightly. Employed as a somewhat graceless publicist, the plump and perky Bridget enters into an affair with her caddish, handsome, sexy boss, winningly played by the ever charming and debonair Hugh Grant.<br /><br />Meanwhile, her mother has introduced her to an attorney, the stiff-necked Mr. Darcy, played to taciturn perfection by Colin Firth. Even though they were once childhood playmates, he and Bridget do not initially click, and it is not love at first sight, as Bridget's mother had so hoped. Bridget goes on her merry way with her boss, unaware that he is two-timing her. When she discovers his perfidy, it is too late, as she already fancies herself in love with him.<br /><br />Mr. Darcy, however, re-enters the picture, and what happens is a thing of beauty to watch. The film is very funny. Rene Zellweger as a Brit is totally believable. She is so good that she would even fool the Queen into believing her to be one of the Queen's own subjects. Without a doubt, this is one of Ms. Zellweger's best roles to date, and she is positively delightful. Moreover, Sharon Maguire's directorial debut is certainly noteworthy, as she shows signs of a deft comedic touch in her direction. This is simply a terrific film. Bravo!
1400049628|5.0|Whether or not you believe that Zombies are real is irrelevant to how much enjoyment you can get from this book. I bought it because I have a bit of a zombie obsession, and as I read it, I found myself wondering how prepared I would be in the event of a zombie outbreak (about a 6/10 in case you're wondering). I've shared this book with many of my friends who enjoyed the read. It is written in a serious tone and is loaded will prudent advice. It includes tips like, best vehicle, best weapon, and best location for avoiding, fighting, and escaping the zombie threat. It also includes a good history of zombie outbreaks. It's worth the money for both it's entertainment value and it's practical advice.
B000057X1O|5.0|This is a raw and powerful movie on the drug trade and its corresponding law enforcement response. It is a series of riveting, interlocking vignettes that tell the story on all fronts of the war on drugs. It paints a picture that will stay with the viewer for some time, so powerful is the imagery employed and so compelling are the actors in their performances.<br /><br />Michael Douglas plays the part of Robert Wakefield, a newly appointed drug czar, who tries to mount an all points attack on the drug trade. Naive and well meaning, he is, unbeknownst to him, being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico, who are fighting a turf war over the profitable drug trade. He is so clueless that when the drug war actually lands on his door step, as when his teenage daughter, wonderfully portrayed by Erika Christiansen, succumbs to peer pressure and becomes addicted to drugs, he is initially in heavy denial. He ignores all the standard warning signs, until it is nearly too late.<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro, in the star making role of Javier, an intelligent, decent, and honest Mexican law enforcement officer, who has his own war on drugs going on, is riveting with his quietly powerful performance. He, too, is being manipulated by the powers that be in Mexico. Nearly too late he realizes that the Mexican general, who is ostensibly battling the war on drugs and to whom Javier had given his full support and cooperation, is engaged in some drug action on the side from which he hopes to profit. The only drug war that the general is really involved in is the one that one drug cartel has with its rival.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back in the states, a wealthy and respected San Diego businessman, played by hunky Steven Bauer, is arrested, as it seems that his businesses are really just a front for the drug trade. His assets frozen, this leaves his beautiful and greedy wife, played by the lovely and talented Catherine Zeta-Jones, picking up the pieces of her husband's empire while he is in jail, awaiting trial. As regent to the kingdom, she cold bloodedly negotiates with the drug cartel to restore her and her husband financially. No shrinking violet is she!<br /><br />There are several other subplots that are also of note and move the story along. All of these vignettes interlock with one another in some fashion, serving to bring the story full circle. To find out how they do so, watch this well directed and powerful film. It is certainly well worth watching and a welcome addition to one's personal film collection.in jail, awaiting trial.

0060934719|5.0|Immerse yourself into the world of Faerie where only Neil Gaiman can properly take you. This novel is an astounding piece of fiction. Gaiman's writing style is so far above the rest of the field, that you find yourself lost in his poetic sensitivity and great storytelling ability. Only Neil Gaiman has a unique talent for blending the fantastical with the artistic ability of Picasso and the vision of a hawk. One of Gaiman's best works and I thoroughlly enjoyed it!! Take the Gaiman journey and you won't be disappointed. This is an adventure that you need to go on!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion is a quiet film filled with the wonderful nuances and subtleties that make up the best of period romance stories. The actors in this version were perfect for their parts and performed them brilliantly, with most dialogue actually taking place between the minor characters. The reactive facial expressions of the lead romantic duo are worth thousands of words. Not a long film, but top quality and highly recommended. If you liked Sense & Sensibility or the BBC version of Pride & Prejudice, you will adore this film.

B00008G6EZ|5.0|It has been around a decade since I first listened to Don Giovanni and it has remained my favourite opera since. Mozart's operatic genius reached its zenith and did not surpass itself after Don Giovanni; and it is arguably his finest written opera, despite (or in spite of) Beethoven's famous disapprobation of the subject matter as \\"immoral\\".    Rodney Gilfry's Don's perhaps the handsomest and most charismatic to date. His looming stature and well-chiselled looks certainly helped in deepening the portrayal of the Don, which he brought to life with ample facial expression and thoughtful sensitivity to the libretto. In terms of voice, enunciation and appearance, Gilfry's got to be the closest to my all-time favourite Don Giovanni, the Swedish Hakon Hagegaard, who, somewhat mysteriously and regrettably vanished from the operatic scene before the turn of the millenium. Some reviewers here had made rather constructive comparisons between Gilfry's and Terfel's Don; the former being more of a spoilt aristocrat, while the latter an insidious psychopath - my idea of the Don straddles somewhat in between, which Hagegaard aptly personified.    The rest of the cast are no less commendable; who could miss Bartolli as Elvira, if the only complain's that she's somewhat larger than life and too prominent for the role that she threatens to steal the scene from the other characters? Isabel Rey plays a \\"middle-aged\\" Donna Anna and delivers her role with a light-weight but memorable voice. Liliana Nikiteanu as Zerlina sings with a unsually deep resonant voice for her role but is equally memorable for her fine acting. Leprorello is somewhat detached from his master's exploits but Lazlo Polgar's appearance served the role almost like his own skin.    The strings of the Zurich Opera are not always spot on, and audiences attuned to the clinical perfection of studio recordings of the opera might find some wide pacings under Harnoncourt a little offensive. Not that this is entirely reproachable, but it has the detriment of loosening the dramatic urgency of the music; case-in-point would be the supper scene, the graveyard scene in Act II and the catalogue and quartet scene in Act I.    The stage layout is a little different from the traditional setup in that hidden mechanisms that operate with great subtlety are gainfully employed (i.e. a moving, turnabout stage); though the stage lighting could generally be improved as many of the scenes are simply to dark (for example the party scene). Audiences expecting opulent settings would be slightly disappointed, and the entrance of the masqueraders is as I found it, a little downplayed than what I would have expected. The Don escaped death at the end of Act I with no defense (he merely shoved Don Ottavio aside) and I thought more thought could have been in place. There are a number of extra-musical effects in the supper scene which could distract one from the music (i.e. throwing of wine glasses etc.) but this could largely be justified to intensify the drama at times. The placement of characters on stage could confound some but is generally still within acceptable limits without losing the license to some artistic flexibility and creativity in terms of the mis-en-scene.    This DVD is well worth its price - it comes with a booklet and extras featuring the making-of the opera with interviews of the cast.    A definite must-own for any enthusiast of the masterpiece.

It wasn't about him being Christian it was about him being a sacrafice.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Disney has always been a leader in animated films, snow white through modern day Disney/Pixar.  But Dumbo is a throw back to the old days, and a very good example of the art of cartoons at its best.  Jumbo Jr. The little elefant with big ears and outcast of the paciderms becomes the hero of the circus. Does it get any better than that. Overcoming triumph. This film never gets old. And, it shows the values of the past, stokes delivering babies, and the ideal mother protecting their children.  Also, Pink elephants as a representation of Drinking.  Back then, nobody really talked about drinking, so they use terms such as \\"seeing pink elephants\\" to say that they were drunk.  That part use to actually scare me as a kid. Anyhow, a must have DVD for the collection, I actually own the laserdisc copy, but did look at this DVD version, and it does have some good features on it. Fun for the whole family.

B0001XALT6|5.0|With an all-star cast including Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Sylvester Stallone, Ray Liotta, Robert Patrick, Michael Rapaport, Janeane Garofalo and Frank Vincent, it is hard not to be impressed by this drama, about police corruption in a small town. The storyline is intriguing with a few surprises along the way, Keitel steals the movie, as crooked cop Ray Donlan. De Niro plays internal affairs copper Moe Tilden, who graduated from the academy with Donlan and holds a personal vendetta against him.<br /><br />Stallone put on a lot of weight for this film, wanting to play a serious role for a change, he does it quite well without being totally convincing in his role. Liotta is once again excellent as is Robert Patrick, this is a collectors item for all who love classic movies.
B000002KO1|5.0|Review no.62. Haven't heard this CD is so long. Many used to call then 'New Wave'. Call me insane, but I say the Pretenders had crossed roads with New Wave along with album rock. Think about THAT for a second. Saw them on this actual tour, when they were support band for The Who on the final leg of the 'Who Are You' U.S. tour. Tracks here they'll always be fondly remembered for are \\"Precious\\", the toe tapping \\"Wait\\",\\"Private Life\\", \\"Private Life\\" and the untouchable \\"Brass In Pocket\\". Anyone else recall the old MTV commercial for their second lp just prior to it's release? It was like the WHOLE world was waiting (some living)for the arrival of their follow-up. Recommended.
B000002UVZ|4.0|The opening riff of \\"Begin The Begin\\", the opening track to Life's Rich Pageant, floored me the first time I heard it, and still does today. I think i took about 10 plays for me to even get halfway through the song the first time because I kept backing it up to hear that near-east/Indian-sounding twang, almost sounding as if George Harrison had revved up his old sitar somehow with high octane speed. <br />LRP isn't REM at its best, however. It IS REM at its most preachy. Though many may argue that the message got watered down in subsequent years and releases, the fact is that was done with what I have to call calculated efficiency. No one (with an ounce of dignity) wants to listen to Michael Stipe stand on a soapbox and rant at them non-stop for 45 minutes.  <br />No matter how awesome the sound of the music is, which it truly is on this album. It's big, it's beefy, it's their hardest-rocking album prior to Monster, and it's one of their better records...on the whole. <br />But remember something in that I am not alone in this assessment. Rolling Stone - in the mid 1990s - called this album the NADIR of Stipe's songwriting. It's just too preachy. After this the story stayed the same, the method in which it was delivered - lyrically and musically - became more user-friendly. If no one is listening to you yelling, make them hear what you're saying by pleasing them. <br />It worked, and I've no qualms with that. <br />As for this record itself, it's a jump in an ice cold pool on a 100 degree day in terms of going from early REM albums to this stage of the band's career. The drums are so prevalent in the mix they seem to obliterate the previous incarnation of the band's sound. <br />\\"Begin the Begin\\", \\"Fall On Me\\", \\"I Believe\\", and \\"Just A Touch\\" are some of their best tunes to listen to, even though some of the lyrical content is - as previously stated - a little heavy-handed. Though I may sound a bit harsh on this matter, I do love this album, and in fact, the guitarpart for \\"Swan Swan H\\" - though it's subject matter is morose and dreary - was used as the wedding march by my first wife in our wedding.

B000E1ZK3M|3.0|JARHEAD recounts author Anthony Swofford's personal journey through the First Iraqi War of the early 1990s.  Based on his bestselling book of the same name, the movie marches through his experiences from boot camp to the deserts of Iraq, from the uncertainty of being accepted by the Marines to losing his girlfriend to a \\"Jody\\" to the harsh realities of civilian losses strewn all around him.  The movie is a hard and unflinching look at that war, and at the men involved in it.<br /><br />Sam Mendes (AMERICAN BEAUTY) directed.  Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Swoff, the principal character, but it's Peter Sarsgaard's protrayal of Troy and Jamie Foxx's no-nonsense approach to Staff Sergeant Sykes that really steal the show.<br /><br />Although off to a rather rocky beginning, with the immediate comparison of Swoff's drill instructor to the one in FULL METAL JACKET, JARHEAD moves quickly into its own rhythm.  The narrative and pacing of the movie is extremely well done and becomes totally hypnotic.  I found myself watching with rapt attention.  Swoff became very real to me, as did Troy.  Jamie Foxx turned in a stellar portrayal of Staff Sergeant Sykes, showing a depth of acting that he isn't often given a chance to do.  He came across as hard, but in one-on-one moments with Swoff, he revealed the dichotomy inherent, I think, in most professional soldiers:  they love what they do, but they're appalled by it at the same time, and even more confused by their love of it.<br /><br />Despite the direction and the acting, though, the substance of the movie seems to be lacking.  The emotion doesn't exactly come out of nowhere at the end, but it definitely goes nowhere.  I know that this is how many of the soldiers felt at the end of that war, but I think it would have helped if we'd gotten to know the characters a little more deeply.  Troy was getting kicked out of the Marines, but why?  Peter Sarsgaard earned a lot of sympathy from me, but I still don't know what he lied about, or why the military felt compelled to kick him out after he was such a good Marine.  That lack of knowledge really hurt at the end of the movie.<br /><br />The HD DVD release offers extremely intense video presentation.  The images are clear and sharp, well-defined.  However, even though the sound separation is done well for surround sound systems, it isn't uncompressed.  With a killer soundtrack laying down the score, the high-def fans willing to buy an enriched product even if they'd already owned a copy of the movie should have gotten that enrichment all the way around.<br /><br />JARHEAD is definitely worth a look from military movie fans, but it's not something that's going to completely satisfy.  Perhaps guys who have actually been over there during the wars will get more out of it, but I just ended up with more questions.or why the military felt compelled to kick him out after he was such a good Marine.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|Say this for John Mayer:  he has yet to make the same album twice. We got drive-with-the-top-down pop in Room for Squares, jazz-laced rock and blues with Heavier Things, and raw, smoky blues guitar on Try! With this one--his most solid, consistent recording to date--he goes for quality rather than quantity with his guitar solos.  The interplay between his guitar and the keyboard work of Ricky Peterson (who has a distinguished resume that includes work for Prince, Eric Clapton, and David Sanborn) is especially delightful for a piano player like me to listen to. (Especially on \\"Vultures\\"--the song has good bones as heard on the Try album--but Ricky adds SO much to this version) The other thing I can say for him is that nearly every song he's written and recorded talks about something I've experienced or am experiencing now.  It's like he's read my mind. Stylistically and in some cases, lyrically, this music takes me back to the late 60s and early 70s (and of course, Bold as Love was actually written then, by Jimi Hendrix). The topics tackled here--political confusion and indifference (\\"Waiting. . .\\", \\"Belief\\"), the death of and recovery from long-term-relationships (Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\", Dreaming With a Broken Heart, In Repair, I'm Gonna Find Another You) the effects of professional success on romance (I Don't Trust Myself), dealing with distractions, temptation, and criticism (Gravity and Vultures), losing loved ones to death (Stop This Train), and garden-variety discouragement (The Heart of Life)--are adult ones. If you want any of that \\"Wonderland\\" stuff, you probably won't like this on the first listen anyway. If you have any \\"life mileage\\" on you--whether you're 19 or pushing 50 or more--this one might be the one to convince you that there's more to John Mayer than you knew. <br /> <br />Enough about the serious stuff--let's talk about the musical styles! <br />Bold as Love is not so much a cover as a tribute to a man we lost too soon.  This is the only track where the lyrics are just plain goofy (or maybe I just need some chemical help to get into them!) When I first heard Waiting on the World to Change (in concert), I thought it was a cover of a Marvin Gaye song--very soulful. (The lyrics could have applied to the Vietnam/Watergate era just as easily as they do to the current situation in the USA)  \\"I Don't Trust Myself\\", \\"Heart of Life\\" and \\"Belief\\" are reminiscent of Clapton and late-60s Beatles.  \\"Stop This Train\\" and \\"In Repair\\"--Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.  \\"Slow Dancing\\" and \\"Dreaming with a Broken Heart\\"--can't think of anyone they remind me of, but they are both laced with a bit of country-style guitar licks. \\"Gravity\\"--definitely blues.  \\"Vultures\\"--funky rock.  And the closing song--\\"I'm Gonna Find Another You\\"--Sam Cooke and Otis Redding-inspired--he closed his Indianapolis concert with this one and what you have on this record is almost a let-down after you've heard it live.  (He also played it on Letterman on 11-23-06--it's probably on youtube.com or somewhere similar) But it's a great track--the only one where we hear him sing with a bit of a twinkle in his eye--and an upbeat way to close out the three-song cycle of heartbreak and healing that ends the album.  I would have bought the album solely for \\"Vultures\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Find Another You.\\"  But it's one of the few albums I own that I never skip tracks on. <br /> <br />Elvis Presley could have kept making fluffy teenybopper music, but he chose to grow up with his fans.  John Mayer is doing the same thing and more--his fan base has grown to include many parents of the kids who loved his early stuff. If his younger fans don't like this one now, I hope they'll hold onto it and listen again in a few years.  They will find that John's already been there one step ahead of them.  \\"The heart of life is good\\" and so is this album.

The fact that the answer the film provides to this anxiety-ridden question is not some transcendent entity nor the government nor aliens is at least original but the fact that the narrator of your life might very well be a chain-smoking sociopath just as depressed about these existential issues as you are will probably not afford you any relief (except of the comic sort). This film asks its questions about self-authorship in an interesting and unfamiliar way and it serves as a sort of a comic wake-up call for those who have acted too long as passive observers of their own realites instead of as active creators (or I should say this is the message most people are taking from the film). Whats really interesting about this film though is not necessarily what you see onscreen but the story being told in the presses about its screenwriter's own attempt, after years of script doctoring for the man, to declare his own independence from the Hollywood script mill by writing from start to finish a script that he could call his own. The resulting script, Stranger Than Fiction, is thus a fictional enacting of its author's real-life urge to break free from the confines of a dehumanizing system and become a self-fashioning agent in his own write.<br /><br />The story gets even odder though when you consider that the film Stranger Than Fiction exists at a kind of generic crossroads between meta-fictional comedy (with only Indie-hit potential) &  romantic comedy (with Hollywood blockbuster break-out appeal) and that its writer never fully commits to either. The writer is of two minds about everything; and the resulting film is a schizophrenic piece of art.<br /><br />The most fascinating way to read this film, I think, is to see both writer and character as two sides of the same person, and to view both to be involved in the identical struggle to liberate themselves from their own formulations. So the question isn't really whether some external agent is scripting our lives but whether we, regardless of whether we see ourselves as artists or real people (or a bit of both), can somehow outrun our tendencies to formulize our lives. It seems that its not really the system that has been sticking it to us all these years but we who have been sticking it to ourselves.<br /><br />The main agents here are I.R.S. investigator Harold Crick (played by a cuddly but subdued Will Ferrell) and his narrator, the psychotically withdrawn Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). The first two-thirds of the film have Harold trying to figure out where that voice in his head is coming from and even though he does figure it out the answer turns out to be a kind of non-answer. That its Kay Eiffel who is narrating Harold Crick's ( a name meant to sound like \\"cricket\\" and meant to subtley allude to Kafka's cockroach) life to Harold Crick doesn't tell us much except that life is more absurd than Kafka imagined it to be (and exactly as absurd as Pirandello imagined it to be). When narrator and narrated finally meet face to face we expect some kind of meta-theatrical feud over agency or something existential but instead its anti-climactic. The fact that author and character do not discuss their relationship or begin a relationship seems obscure (if this were a French movie I think author and character would sleep with one another and contemplate the fact that the thing that determines all of our lives is the American film industry).  But since its an American film and not a French film it has to be a romantic comedy and so the characters do not need to speak because the fact that it will eventually be a romantic comedy --because its being made for an American market and has to be-- has predetermined the outcome.<br /><br /> Hoffman as literary theorist Jules Hilbert bursts onto the screen like a bolt of highly-caffeinated lightning. And he steals the show, at least in my book. Ultimately this literary theorist who seems to be brimming with keen observational powers is only interested in life if he can fit it to some recognizable literary pattern; and this turns out to be as dehumanizing as Kay's adherence to her easily recognizable literary formulae and Harolds own numbers obsession. What makes Hoffman's character so great though is that none of this predetermination stuff bothers him in the slightest. He's perfectly at ease with life being reduced to formula. In fact hes long since resigned himself to this fact. Whether the film is a romantic comedy or a metaphysical caper picture (like say I Heart Huckabees)makes no difference to him. Although given the choice, one assumes, Jules Hilbert would prefer to be in a metaphysical caper picture.<br /><br /> A relationship between the novelist and literary theorist is hinted at and would be a logical move since they each love the same thing (looking at life from a perch) but this opportunity is passed by and we do not even get so much as a conversation between these two like-minded literary formulizers. Kay re-writes the script of Harold's life but this doesn't change the fact that Harold Crick is still not the author of his life (unless you see Kay and Harold as two sides of one person).<br /><br /> Maggie Gyllenhaal as Ana Pascal, an anarchist/business owner, and nurturer, becomes for Harold Crick a kind of symbol of all that automated man needs to feel human once again. When Harold Crick woos her with a punk song (*Wreckless Eric's \\"Whole Wide World\\"-incredible song!!!) that he just learned on guitar we realize that the film has only two options left: go the way of the old European films of Godard and Antonioni and fade out in a moment of existential irresolvedness or dissolve all existential doubt in sentiment by becoming a romantic comedy. And it chooses both.seems to be brimming with keen observational powers is only interested in life if he can fit it to some recognizable literary pattern; and this turns out to be as dehumanizing as Kay's adherence to her easily recognizable literary formulae and Harolds own numbers obsession.

1400032717|5.0|An interesting story from the get-go, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time surpassed all expectations. A completely original story that brings in a unique writing stlye that leaves you begging for more. A story whose mundane character, Christopher, tackles all obstacles rationally and logically makes for one of the best reads one could hope for. <br /> <br />This book luckily came into my possession even though I was hesitant to pick it up because it was neither Fantasy or Sci-fi. My new favorite book.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Top Secret!~ Jim Abrahams is a great movie but if people born after the fall of the Berlin Wall will not enjoy it as much. Being a child of the 70's I can clearly remember the cold war and always wondering what was hidden in the enemies camp. This is a great parody of cold war spy movies with witty dialog and a story line that is quite well written. Val Kilmer is doing a quite a good job and is a much better actor then I thought possible, and Omar Shariff is also doing a bang up job in the little role that he has. Val Kilmer plays Nick Jones who is supposed to be a parody of Elvis and all the less then stellar movies that he starred in. There are so many classic scenes in this movie, but if I have to pick one then then I pick the restaurant scene or the over the top prison scene. I would highly recommend this movie without a doubt. I definitely give it 5 out 5 stars.

B000I0QK74|5.0|I actually bought the Hallmark version last year for my husband, who is a die hard James Taylor fan. I have to admit, it is really and truly wonderful. I applaud the song selections...this collection is pure Christmas album genius, this coming from a person who loves Christmas music a bit more than she loves James Taylor. His voice is as gentle, smooth, and unassuming as ever and lends itself perfectly to these songs, especially Some Children See Him, which I love, love, love.  My other favorites include In the Bleak Midwinter, and the unfamiliar Who Comes This Night. But really...they are all terrific. I am thinking of buying another copy to keep in the car since the whole family really loves this one. Thanks J.T.
B00005JPBD|5.0|Almodovar has established a particular liaison with the feminine world as any other filmmaker since Fassbinder. His narrative pulse is like a canvas that slowly reveals before us; the slow introduction filled of discrete poetry and warm hues will arouse a sudden murder that will lead us into a profound story of weird fascination, mystery, incest, betrayal and death.<br /><br />Carmen Maura as the missing mother and Penelope Cruz (in the role of her lifetime, fresh, radiant and spontaneous) will be the big frame to expose with impeccable pulse, this crude and awful story where the leader role is assumed entirely for the women.<br /><br />If previously Federico Fellini had focused around the ominous presence of the women in 8 1/2 and The city of women with slender pertness and Fassbinder saw the women as the true leader of the social nerve, Almodovar bets for a straightforward gaze and explores with delicate fluidness and absolute domain of the feminine universe around her fears, ambitions and wishes to live above any adverse circumstance with engaging humor but with visceral humanism.<br /><br />Additionally we may find a heartfelt homage to the famous Tango Volver in Carlos Gardel' s memory in magnificent arrangement; a deserved tribute to Chinatown and finally a nostalgic gaze to three other emblematic films of the past Bellisima (watch to Magnani in the brief TV Film), Mildred pierce and Douglas Sirk' s Imitation of life.<br /><br />This movie must be included among the top ten films I have seen throughout this year. Another masterpiece of this hyper talented  Spanish filmmaker.
B000HT386M|4.0|I love Adam Sandler movies like Mr. Deeds and 50 First Dates so I had high hopes for this one.  I was not disappointed.  Sandler plays this workaholic who has a nice family - a wife and two kids.  One day he goes looking for a universal remote and he finds a remote which \\"controls his universe\\".  He can fast forward through parts of his life or he can go back and see previous parts (but not change them).  But there are some problems with his remote (I won't give away the plot).  Sandler's life starts unraveling in a bad way.  I thought the movie had a unique story and a good cast; there were also some funny parts.  I would recommend watching it.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|First, let me say that I'm a staunch Republican and was skeptical about what type of propaganda Al Gore might try to push on the audience with this documentary. However, outside of the few jabs he took at Republican administrations, I came away with both an eye-opening and deafening appreciation for the environmental alarms that are being rang across the globe via references of droughts, floodings, and catastrophes such as Katrina; which I'm personally familiar with. The one thing that stood clear in this film was that he stuck to scientific data--the facts.  As I watched this film, one adage came to mind that I once read on a placard in a zoo, and that was: \\"We did not inherit the earth. We merely borrowed it from our children.\\" I was profoundly moved by his message and immediately felt duped by contra-conspiracies about the truth in our environment. I strongly urge everyone to have a copy of this film to educate themselves, their children, and their community. Religion, politics, and race need-not-be an issue here for we definitely all have this \\"one world\\" in common. In fact, I'm off to order several copies of this DVD to hand out as stocking-stuffers for Christmas. I applaud Al Gore and all involved in putting this message out. I just pray that we're not too late.  <br /> <br />Ramon Cuevas <br />New Orleans, LA <br /> <br />
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Let's face it, the Beatles catalog has just about been tapped out. There's that longer version of Helter Skelter (which would get old quickly) and the Christmas songs that went to fan club members, but about everything else has been issued. So this is as good as it's going to get.  I'll admit there are times it sounds like a \\"Stars on 45\\" treatment of their music, but other moments bring drama.  <br />If you've seen the show in Vegas, you'll appreciate it more. If you're a diehard, you'll want to have it regardless. If you're only a casual fan, you shouldn't bother.
B0007PALZ2|4.0|I saw this film a few years after its initial release and was pleasantly surprised.  I would not consider myself a huge fan of Director Terry Gilliam (Brazil, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas...), but his films are sources for many cult followings.   <br /> <br />This plot seemed simple enough; Time travel to save the world.  If only it were that simple.  Terry Gilliam takes the concepts of what we consider the future and throws them out the window.  Without giving the whole movie away, it is best to surmise it with the main characters \\"mission\\".  James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to discover the origins of a plague that wipes out the world population.  The subject of his mission is the group \\"12 Monkeys\\", which is led by Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt).  Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) is a doctor who tries to help Mr. Cole deal with the realities of mental illnesses she believes he is experiencing. <br /> <br />Coming into the film, I enjoyed previous work by Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe.  Yet I (unlike the rest of the world) was not a fan of Brad Pitt.  I would have to say he was a big factor in deciding not to see this movie in theaters.  Boy was I surprised. Pitt was great in this film.  After seeing his performance, I became a very big fan of Pitts work.  Willis and Stowe make the front line cast shine.  Christopher Plummer makes a nice appearance playing Jeffrey Goines' father. <br /> <br />I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys watching films that allows you let go of reality for a short time and can appreciate creative film making.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I seen this show, I thought it was kind of boring.  It was the best show I ever seen, these characters who played in How I Met Your Mother are real people with real problems.  This show is compared to Cheers and the Wonder Years.  Difference between the Wonder Years and How I Met Your Mother, The Adult Kevin Arnold voiced by Daniel Stern tells the stories his early teen years from 12-16 from 1968-1973.  How I Met Your Mother tells the story about about fifty-something Ted Mosby voiced by Bob Saget tells the story about how he met his mother to his teenage kids and his adult years in 2006. Mostly the show revolves arounds five friends Ted Mosby, Marshall Eriksen, Lily Aldrin, Robin Scherbatsky and Barney Stinson.  It will ruin the show, it the Adult Ted Mosby doesn't reveal the mother.  When I look at Ted Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky they're like the couple from the movie The Last Kiss Michael and Jenna.  Jenna who was having a baby girl with Michael and Michael is an architect trying to find his place.  Alyson Hannigan came from a long way from playing Willow Rosenberg and Michelle Flaherty in American Pie.  Some of her Buffy Alumni guest starred in how I met Your Mother, Alexis Denisof who played Sandy Rivers who always hitting on Robin, Amy Acker who plays Penelope the one who helps Ted make the rain dance and use to go out with Barney and Tom Lenk the nerdy coffee House guy who was hitting on Lily. I never have to worry about her being typecast. Alyson Hannigan has the greatest resemblance of Alias Star Jennifer Garner and Michelle Trachtenberg.  Tell you the truth, she ever played Agent Sydney Bristow from Alias, Elektra Natchios from Daredevil and Jenna Rink 13 Going on 30 she would have done it better.  Even Ben Affleck could mistake her for Jennifer Garner.   Josh Radnor looks like T.V.'s Ed Justin Long and Scrubs Zach Braff. Jason Segel has the greatest resemblance of Smallville's Tom Welling who played Clark Kent. Cobie Smulders has the greatest resemblanceof Mission Impossible III's Michelle Monaghan who played Tom Cruise's fiance Julia Meade and Smallville's Kristin Kreuk who played Lana Lang.  Let's see, what this show can do.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I didn't get out to see this one when it came out, but finally got to see it on DVD.  I had high expectations when I started to watch it, and wasn't disappointed at all. <br /> <br />Natalie Portman was outstanding and it was a great story with some unexpected twists.  Her performance alone was worth the price of the disc. <br /> <br />I'm generally not a big fan of action movies, but this was one of the rare action movies that makes you think.  I found myself pulling for the terrorist and thinking about how things are rarely as black and white as they seem.  The action scenes were fun, the writing was exceptional and the acting was outstanding.   <br /> <br />Normally, when I watch a movie on dvd, I'll watch about 30 minutes at a time, but with this one, I couldn't turn it off.  Once I started to watch it I couldn't walk away.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I won't go into any depth here, as so many seem to mirror my feelings about this, but as an avid fan, I was a bit leery about this new project. I could see so many ways this would disappoint me. Boy was I wrong. This is an incredible release. I have to admit that my absurd love for the band had been waning as I found new artists; this album re-ignites my passion for the band. Hearing these tracks took me back to when I first fell in love with these songs, it's just that good. The mash-up process challenges you to listen hard to what is being offered, and your reward is being reminded on why these guys are and were the best band in history. I really can't imagine why anyone would not enjoy it, but for a fan...you have to get this album..it's all too much!
B000FSME1A|3.0|This film was made in 1979, meaning it was made before I was born.  This review is purely from a cinematic point of view, not a \\"movie of the times\\" review. <br /> <br />Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on a mission into Cambodia to assassinate a Green Beret, Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando), in Cambodia. <br /> <br />I heard a lot of history behind this film, depicting it to be a fantastic portrayal of the Vietnam War.  Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job capturing the atmosphere of war.  The characters, the sets, the tone; all top notch.  The choice of direction for the main character was great.  The narration adds to the \\"journal\\" feel of the film.  Combined, all the factors capture an understanding of what Vietnam did to the soldiers on the ground.  As for the cast, Dennis Hopper was an excellent choice for the drug addicted photojournalist. <br /> <br />My criticism of the film would have to be its pacing.  The movie lags in places to a point that might make you loose interest in the characters.  Make sure you have a few hours to dedicate, and you should be in good shape to see the breakdown of the human psyche.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|If nothing else Mona Lisa Smile sends a message to society women of the 1950's to make more of your lives.  The story is cetered around Wesleyan, an female college which truly was a breeding ground for preppie upper society ladies to appear well educated and marry into a well to do family.  Julia Roberts's Ms Watson character arrives from California and sets this world in for a spin.  She tries to teach her students to look at art and life in a more open minded way as well as to make the most of your abilities.<br /><br />In the course of her one year at Wesleyan, she effects the lives of students and even the faculty around her.  Also, she learns about herself in the process.  Even if it comes from some romantic heartache.<br /><br />The one part of the movie which disappoints me is where the the mother of one of the college girls actually sends her daughter back to her philandering husband without any regard to her feelings.  Its a bit irrealistic that a mother would be that heartless.<br /><br />Similar to Dead Poets Society, Mona Lisa Smile stands pretty tall in most regards.
B000BNX3B4|1.0|I got this movie at work [library], hoping it would be good. I had seen the trailer for it and had high hopes. Boy, was I disappointed. The first 2/3 of the movie moved along relatively slow. Then, Diane Lane's character goes from being a sweet girl to being a w***e and dating any and every man, including having a one night stand. Ten minutes of the movie involves Lane's and Cusack's characters speeding down streets and driving eratically in order to find a convenience store still open...they want condoms.  <br /> <br />I think whoever wrote this screenplay should be humiliated, to say the least. It was made out to be this really \\"great\\" romantic comedy. It wasn't romantic until the last 10 minutes or so. It wasn't even remotely funny. I admit, there were maybe 2 or 3 one-liners in there, but other than that...I had to force my eyes to stay open until the end.
B000GG4KTU|3.0|I have every one of Ms Krall's works except for the 'Other Room' which I found turgid and nondescript. This collection of songs , I think, seeks to recapture the magic of 'When I look in your eyes', but fails in many aspects. Yes, her voice is still smooth, yet somehow seems tired, and lacks the sparkle of, say, 'Popsicle Toes', to name but one track. I really wanted to hear 'Day In, Day Out' but I was sorely disappointed and I was fast forwarding to another track after about a minute and a half. <br /> <br />The arrangements are clinically correct...so much in fact that they spoil much of the character found in her earlier stuff, almost as though it was a deperate attempt to replicate the style that made her famous in the first place. The use of a badly mixed muted trumpet didn't help matters. She is great with a trio...leave it at that. It ain't broke..just needs a bit of re-vamping. <br />What the producers don't seem to have understood is that the 'song pool' has dried up considerably since Ms Krall started rejuvenating standards. In the past 3 or 4 years, people such as Buble, Collins and even Rod Stewart have plundered the best material for their own musical junkets, and what we see here is a bunch of well-done songs, but not the best material that money can buy. It's almost as though they were desperate to get this package out as soon as possible. <br /> <br />My opinion is that Ms K needs to look at some contemporary material by some newer composers (definitely NOT her husband's stuff!) and re-work THAT to appeal to her fans. <br />It's a pleasant enough piece of work, but not on my 'A' list....great for driving at night, but then again, so is Kenny G!
1563898586|5.0|One of Alan Moore's most celebrated comic masterpieces, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a treat for comic fans and literary buffs alike.  In 1898, the mysterious M recruits adventurer Allan Quartermain, Miss Mina Murray, Captain Nemo, Invisible Man Hawley Griffin, and cowardly Dr. Henry Jekyll, and of course, his devilish alter ego, the Hulk-ish Mr. Hyde.  Moore's love of classic, English literature is so apparent throughout this first volume, with his deep and rich characterizations and twisting storyline.  Kevin O'Neil's artwork is masterful as well, and his vivid drawings bring Moore's lush world to life that hasn't done his work justice since David Lloyd and Dave Gibbons.  If there's any real nitpicking that can be done with this book, it's that Mr. Hyde isn't so much brutish as he is much like an insane Hulk, which is nice for a change of pace for the character, but seems like a bit of a predictable idea for Moore.  That aside, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a masterwork of comic and literary fiction, and believe it or not, it only gets better from this point on.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|37 years later......The Cream still has that energy.  Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker prove that they can still play their classic tunes without missing much.  Whereas Clapton's guitar tone is much different in the 21st century, it still is enjoyable and oh hat riffs galore.  Badge sounds super as does Crossroads.<br /><br />Jack Bruce in spite of looking quite frail can still sing quite well.  We're Going Wrong, Spoonful, and NSU really show Bruce in fine form.  His bass playing fits very well mixing in betwen Clapton's guitar and Bakers drumming.<br /><br />And oh whatabout Mr. Baker.  He can still drum with reckless abandon.  Jut listen to Rollin' and Tumblin and Pressed Rat and Warthog(where he even sings or chats). And he looks more alert and focused than he did back in the 1960's.<br /><br />Quite enjoyable al the way through especially with the interviews.  It was nice that these guys put their differences aside to give the people a very memorable reunion.
0373771665|5.0|\\"Venetia\\" has the distinction of being the last Georgette Heyer I read before I had to settle for rereads. And while it is a novel that has all the Heyer trademarks of quality -- a good story, memorable and well developed characters, and a truly sparkling and witty prose style -- it is also somewhat different from most of her other novels, in that, as another reviewer on Amazon.com (bookjunkiereviews) has put it, in that the novel's heroine, Venetia Lanyon, has a rather realistic yet sunny approach to life. <br /> <br />The storyline for \\"Venetia\\" is simplicity itself: the very beautiful, intelligent and sunny natured Venetia Lanyon had long resigned to herself to spinsterhood -- afterall here she was, at the ripe age of twenty-five, living in the country, running her brother Conway's estate, while he was off playing at being a soldier, keeping house for her sickly but brilliant younger brother, Aubrey, and with two improbable country swains as suitors. Enter the roguish Lord Dameral: neighbour of the Lanyons, this rakish and jaded aristocrat is surely the very last person anyone would expect sheltered and virtuous Venetia to become good friends with. But this is exactly what happens much to the consternation of those who love Venetia... <br /> <br />This is a very \\"grown-up\\" kind of novel, about the relationship between two adults of very different upbringings and two very different temperaments, from friendship and a sincere admiration to something more (in fact as several other reviewers have already mentioned, the attraction between Venetia and Demeral fairly sizzles and yet there is not one sexually explicit scene! goodness!!). Georgette Heyer does a fantastic job of charting this blossoming relationship from its incipience to the painful parting to the satisfying and triumphant end. And while I'm ashamed to own that I didn't enjoy this charming novel as it so fully deserved all those years ago, I'm happy to relate that I have enjoyed \\"Venetia,\\" more and more with each subsequent read, ever since. I've read a great many romance novels, but I don't think that I've ever read anything quite so romantically satisfying as \\"Venetia.\\"

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'm a second generation Beatles fan, the kind who heard Red Rose Speedway before venturing back in time to appreciate the Beatles. Perhaps that is the reason that I'm enjoying the Love CD rather than complaining like the first generation fans. Some of them really seem angry over this release instead of appreciating the music. After all, it was the music that drew us in to begin with, isn't it? I don't agree with the \\"cash in\\" complaints because this is not a rehash of hits, this is really a new experience and a rebirth of sorts to the Beatles testament of greatness. Only music that is interesting can be rearranged and made new again and that's exactly what has happened with the LOVE CD. Maybe if I was 10 years older and lived through Beatlemania I would react differently, who knows. What I do know is that even all these years later, the Beatles have set the standard for projects like this that others will use as a measuring stick to do other back catalogs. I'll bet if Brian Wilson plans a Beach Boys \\"mash up\\" project, he'll look to the Beatles LOVE as the gold standard of what to strive for. I hope some folks will give this a second chance, it's really quite remarkable.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|DM means a lot to me, and so I was terribly dissapointed when Exciter came out.  I thought DM was over.  Then this.  I think this album is the most profound music DM has ever created.  It totally grew on me after I saw them live in NYC.  I wound up listening to same songs over and over again for months.  I don't even have enough words to describe the effect this music has on me.  It's this particular combination of music and lyrics that creates an amazing emmotional landscape that just sucks you in. <br /> <br />Obviously, this is my subjective opinion.  This album is very dark, sometimes turning into weird, like in the case of \\"Damaged People.\\"  But, it's Depeche Mode weird.  This is now one of my most favorite DM songs.  \\"Macro\\" is another one.  \\"I want it all\\" is yet another.  There is a beat section reminiscent of Bjork, as someone pointed out here, in the very end of the song that's just pure subconscious vibration. <br /> <br />\\"Playing the Angel\\" is now definitely my favorite DM album.  If I could give 10 starts to it, I would.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Listening to \\"Love\\" is like dreaming of the music of The Beatles. It's fun. It's well done. It sounds great. And it's no doubt the perfect soundtrack to the Love show. But ultimately, it's the kind of taste that makes me hunger for a remastered Beatles catalog. I want to hear the real thing sound this good!

B000ICLHIE|5.0|It takes guts and skill to pull off a package like this.  Vince Gill did it recently, with his 4-CD country set \\"These Days.\\"  Then there are the slew of double-CD packages throughout rock 'n roll history.<br /><br />But none of those individuals had the creatitivy and sheer demented talent of Tom Waits.<br /><br />ORPHANS is the culmination of Waits and company's talents.  There are rough saloon ballads; racous party stompers; odes to growing old; remembrances of youth; traditional ballads; tear-in-my-beer country weepers; caberet maladies; bizarre recitations; touching gospel numbers; rants, raves, and rages; even a five-and-a-half minute rap about King Kong.  There's a recitation of the characteristics of various insect species (culminating in a scathing social satire); an ode to a bull's private parts made into dogfood; and a tribute to a suicide bomber.  The set begins with a sixties-flavored rock number, and ends with an elaborate joke (probably one of the funniest things I have heard in ages).<br /><br />As you might guess, it's impossible to categorize ORPHANS.  But then, that's Tom Waits for you.  He's beyond description; his music is as smart as it is stupid, as witty as it is dull--and all of it is purely intentional.  Which makes the man something of a musical genius.  ORPHANS is sure to become a classic record collection, if for nothing else than the audacity it took to make something so diverse, so fulfilling.  If there's something you want, you can find it here...just be careful what you ask for.  Because Tom Waits knows what you REALLY want--and he's more than happy to hand it to you on a silver platter.  Just don't hold him responsible for the psychological damages.
B000I5Y8XM|5.0|I was very excited to see a new album by Moya Brennan and this one definitely did not disappoint!  Very beautiful songs and quite a few catchy numbers...  I highly recommend this album.  Equally as excellent as her other solo albums!!
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I ordered this album before it was released and I have nothing to complain about.  It's nice to see how people change over the years...and most of the times they step up to the next level...having said that, I am glad to see the mature side of Josh Groban and how he has evolved with the songs that he chose for this album...and not to mention that most of the songs are in English.  These are my favorites of the favorites:    2.  You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)-- Thank you for this song!  It gives us hope & lifts us up...  4.  February Song-- Beautiful song...I wish it was sung to me!  I love the beginning, middle and the end of this song!  When he plays the piano in the beginning there I am humming it along.  5.  L'Ultima Notte-- I can't get this song out of my head!  I love this song!  My favorite!  7.  In Her Eyes-- I honestly think it takes great vocal skills to sing this song.  It seems as if I'm taken to a distant era, like in a kingdom far away...maybe during the Persian Empire and Josh is singing this song to moi. Sigh! :)  9.  Now or Never-- Wow, another side of Josh...I'm impressed!  12. Weeping-- They couldn't have done it better!  Great harmony indeed.  13. Machine-- I wasn't expecting this type of song...nice!  14. Verita-- It seems as if I've heard this song before, and wow, another beautiful song that I can't get out of my head!    I haven't commented on his two songs in Spanish because I haven't had the time to listen to those two songs...and as I've mentioned earlier, I like the fact that there are more songs in English than his previous albums...but going back to the songs in Spanish...he's doing a great job thus far but he should watch out on the pronunciation of the t's, q's, and p's but other than that, he's doing a better job than me in the r's. :)      Overall, I like this cd, where he's going and how he's evolving.  Like he said, some people will hate this album and he might gain a new group of fans that will love it...count me on the 'love it' side...and I still love his first two albums.  Good job Josh!
B000J10ERO|4.0|Even though my review might say otherwise, the original Richard Donner film was merely a good superhero movie and one of the better comic book movies. However, there were just some things that were merely uninteresting, slightly long or just unnecessary. Part II was actually surprisingly good while the less said about III and IV is for everyone's benefit. Stuck in development hell for the better part of a decade, the film finally got lifted off the ground when Bryan Singer, director of the Usual Suspects and first 2 X-Men films came onboard. Thankfully, the ideas of Doomsday riding a mechanical spider have been exorcised and we have a solid entry into the series that will probably disappoint some. <br /> <br />It's been 5 years since Superman disappeared, searching for the remains of his home planet, Krypton. Returning, he finds the world is still in trouble and moreso, his love Lois Lane has moved on, with evidence in the Pulitzer winning article \\"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman\\". Not only that, but Lex Luthor is out of jail and he's got a mind for another land deal which of course puts the entire United States at risk. And so of course, Superman has to contend with not only Luthor but a woman who doesn't love him anymore and a responsibility that he abandoned. <br /> <br />It's slightly eerie at how Superman's career has always been in direct competition or level as DC Comics' other hero, Batman. They both had an excellent first film, a pretty good second film with the next 2 being absolute duds, the worst being the 4th. Superman Returns is like the Batman Begins of the series, only it doesn't restart the series so much as it puts it back on track. Ignoring part III and IV, the film is essentially the \\"real\\" Superman III, taking place after II. Is this better than the first one? Relatively speaking I like it better but only by a bit. Newcomer Brandon Routh, while looking a bit too similar to Christopher Reeve, is perfect as bumbling nervous Clark and hero of the Earth, Superman. I never liked Gene Hackman's wisecracking portrayal of Luthor and Spacey manages to have that menace he needed while also providing some humor.(Some of it unintentional: \\"wrong!\\") While the rest of the cast is fine, the one misfire is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane. She doesn't give a bad performance really, it's just Lois is supposed to be a feisty gal born out of woman's liberation movement while she plays it as a soft-spoken damsel in distress at times. <br /> <br />Well it's a Superman movie so do we get to see superhero stuff? Naturally. Probably the best action scene of the year, Superman has to save a maiden voyage of an airplane attached to a space shuttle has they careen towards space and Earth. It's exciting, energetic and just plain awesome. The rest of the stuff he does is not as ambitious but it's certainly no less cool, bringing out the geek in us that loves to see guys lift up 10 tonne globes. The one thing though is that the effects at times look slightly obvious. The flying though has never been better(except for a really bad digital double shot at the end), with the cape finally have some wind in it, unlike 1978's cape where it just flopped down his legs. Shot on the Genesis HD camera, the film looked sharp in theatre and most likely will on next-gen players but on DVD they look slightly too obvious or grainy. Is the film too long? At times, but it gives the film much needed character moments without being a teenybopper superhero movie for the masses(such as Fantastic Four). <br /> <br />Batman Begins to me at times didn't feel exciting, as if it looked exciting but it didn't keep me enthralled. Superman Returns did, only the length and ANOTHER Luthor land mass scheme made it knock down a point or 2 but this is another one on the list for best comic book hero films, and it's about time too.

0812975219|5.0|As a society we are drowning in information that we are increasingly unable and unwilling to properly filter.  Mr. Taleb's book is on my shortest list of recommendations for precisely that reason--it speaks of a studied humility in the face of randomness that is sadly lacking not only ourselves but in so many of those to whom we look for guidance.  In focusing on our very powers of observation, this book strikes at truths that profoundly impact any human endeavor.<br /><br />When did we as a society lose the distinction between Noise and Signal?  Forget the discussion of sophisticated financial instruments--derivatives, options and the like.  I prefer to linger upon Mr. Taleb's expressed disdain for the media.  He poses a fascinating question:  Should we wait to receive our information in the form of studied books rather than the breathless commentary that accompanies the typical newspaper article or television broadcast?  It is his idiosyncratic filtering of information that was most thought-provoking because he gives solid and justifiable reasons for his opinions rather than take the typical \\"expert\\" approach and give his statements as gospel truth.  The discussion at pg. 233 (softcover) is wonderfully illustrative:  \\"For the best way to understand how we could be rational in our perception of the risks and probabilities and, at the same time, be foolish while acting on them would be to have a conversation with a cigarette smoker.  For few cigarette smokers remain unaware of the lung cancer rates in their population.  If you remain unconvinced, take a look at the ... nurses (and, perhaps, doctors) standing outside the entrance [to the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center] with a cigarette in hand as hopeless patients are wheeled in for their treatments.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Taleb has focused upon a crucial blindness in human nature--his question is whether we can train ourselves to be rational and the book speaks to his doubts that it is possible.  Like the optical illusions with which we are all familiar, we can only teach ourselves that we are fundamentally incapable of rationally evaluating random events.<br /><br />Save scripture, which comes with a decidedly higher authority than Mr. Taleb as well as a strikingly similar opinion of the wisdom of men, Fooled by Randomness is the only non-fiction book I have read in the last twenty years that I have immediately begun to re-read.  Highest Recommendation.ons with which we are all familiar, we can only teach ourselves that we are fundamentally incapable of rationally evaluating random events. <br /> <br />Save scripture, which comes with a decidedly higher authority than Mr. Taleb as well as a strikingly similar opinion of the wisdom of men, Fooled by Randomness is the only non-fiction book I have read in the last twenty years that I have immediately begun to re-read.

B00000IREA|5.0|The 1960's were an era of terrifically beautiful actresses, ranging from Ursula Andress to the starlets of Hammer Film Productions.  Among the highest order of cinematic goddesses was young Jane Fonda, whose performance in the title role of \\"Barbarella\\" remains extremely erotic--today's more explicit sexuality notwithstanding.  The film's slight storyline concerns a futuristic \\"astro-navigatrix\\" trying to track down a mad scientist and prevent him from using a horrific weapon that he invented.  Hot on his trail Our Heroine encounters all manner of intergalactic beings who do their best to separate her from her unusually frail space-girl costumes; a blind angel, sadistic \\"leather men,\\" children w/carnivorous dolls, and a tyrannical lesbian queen are all eager to entice Barbarella into their various fun & games.  Finally, when the space-girl does catch up to her quarry (the crazed scientist wonderfully named Duran Duran) he too wants to work out his fantasies on her; he subjects her to his \\"excessive machine\\"--a pleasant torture device that supposedly kills by inducing a lethal number of orgasms!  Fortunately, Barbarella's [...] capabilities outlast the machine, causing it to collapse in broken fuses.  And so it goes until the less-than-inevitable, but happy, finale.    All in all this film's fantastic episodes are brilliant, inspired.  Barbarella's narrow escape from flesh-eating dolls as well as her many encounters with the lesbian tyrant (played to the hilt by Anita Pallenberg) are truly imaginative sequences.  Other highlights include the film's initial scene--with Barbarella doing a strip-tease in a zero-gravity chamber; and her down-and-dirty defeat of Duran Duran's nasty machine.  In essence there are very few dull moments in the entire film.  Director Roger Vadim--Jane Fonda's husband at the time--was at the height of his considerable powers.  And Mistress Fonda herself was glorious; in such an unlikely role, her extreme beauty blended harmoniously with an essential innocence in a way that made her the cinematic descendant of Marilyn Monroe!  For any actress at any time there can be no higher praise than comparison with Marilyn; and in Jane Fonda's case, such comparison is actually deserved.  My highest ratings.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This album is so good that it would be chocolate if it was edible. I have been listening to it for 3 weeks now and cannot seem to stop. It will make you cry, think, dream, hope, love, sleep and so full of life. Awake tops it for me in terms of Josh's personal touch so far. I mean, if someone had told me that a person could be soooooooo talented ( producer, drummer, incredible singer, pianist....) I wouldn't have believed it. This is as close to perfection as it can gets. Someone wrote previously that he seems to reach for his high notes in this new album and he/she doesn't like it. Too bad because Josh really shows what he can do vocally and artistically and I'm just\\"\\"\\"WOOWED\\"\\"\\". Way to go Josh. YOU ROCK!!!
B000AL5OZA|4.0|After hearing about Agnetha's post ABBA depression, I was excited to hear about this album. However, 20 years later, this is simply a reissue and unless you are a fan of ABBA, there is nothing noteworthy here. Without Benny and Bjorn, the instrumentals and writing are missing. Agnetha does cover a Justin Hayward song (Moody Blues) and a Jeff Lynne song (ELO), but its fairly unremarkable. BUT...if you are a fan, you'll probably love it!
B00000099Y|5.0|In my opinion, this and the magnificent Lateralus were 2 of the best albums put out in my lifetime. Naysayers need to take their complaints elsewhere. Yes, Tool is dark, complicated, and maybe even a little pretentious, but that's exactly what they set out to be. If you don't like these qualities, please don't rate them based on it.
0060888695|5.0|I listened to this audiobook on a long road trip recently and found it held my attention from beginning to end. First, Spacek is an excellent reader who has a unique way of giving every character a unique voice--both sexes, and all ages, races, and social classes. She even manages to project the feistiness and naivte of the young narrator (\\"Scout\\" Finch, who is about 7 years old through most of the novel) without being as annoying as the character most likely was to the adults she interacted with. Spacek's warmth and sensitive reading were essential in communicating that MOCKINGBIRD is a novel about how a community understands itself: the silences it keeps and the things it will and won't tolerate. Although I read the book many years ago and enjoyed it then, what struck me as especially interesting upon hearing it anew is that Harper Lee has done something very unique, she has presented us with a dual coming-of-age story. At the same time that Scout is facing some hard realities as she reaches what theologicans used to call \\"the age of reason,\\" her brother Jim is moving from childhood to adolescence (at one point he proudly displays a single chest hair), a time of troubling ambiguity. This dual perspective of reason and sexuality proves to be the perfect lens through which to observe the key events of the story, the ugliness of racism and the trumped-up charges of rape that Atticus Finch, the children's father, is called to address in his role as court-appointed lawyer for an accused black man. At times the novel veers toward preachy, and I'm sure some readers/listeners will find it heavy-handed. But somehow, perhaps because it is told to us by a child, this heavy-handedness seems easy to forgive.
1400044162|3.0|Adichie's Half of a Yellow Sun <br /> <br />By Amanta Usukpam Ukpaghiri <br /> <br />I finished reading Half of a Yellow Sun and was left with a lingering sense of sadness at having completed the novel too quickly. I wished it continued and that l continued to read it, perhaps, for a very long time. It is a masterpiece of a work, destined to be a classic; Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has trod where many others have feared to tread. She has taken the pain and suffering and horror of a people - the Igbos -- and given them novelistic prominence, and by so doing, asked historical questions that still demand answers. She, in effect, stands athwart the current amnesia in Nigeria and requests that the country comes to terms with the Igbo sub-nationality and either accept it as a full member of the polity -- or leave it alone to its own devices. Admirably, she is (as she said in an interview) \\"insistently and consciously\\" Igbo - and unlike several economic climbers in today's Nigeria, is never shamelessly apologetic that she is Igbo. <br /> <br />This book is truly more than a novel - although even as a novel, it is extremely well crafted, brimming with characters that come alive and leap off the pages and embody events that unquestionably took place in the history of Nigeria. Indeed, this book is a form of historical narrative that tells the story of Igbos' vibrant engagement with Nigeria in the 1960s before the civil war, the massacres of tens of thousands of Igbos following military intervention in politics, and the period of the civil war itself from 1967 to 1970. <br /> <br />Chimamanda has achieved several noble things with one stroke. She has furnished literature with simple, elegant and sharp sentences and a (albeit horror) story beautifully woven together in paragraph after paragraph. She has also written a history of the Igbos during a certain period of time. Finally she has presented a literary monument to love and relationships and hope and human dignity. Her characters - - their lives, their triumphs, and their failures - speak to the enduringness of love and truth and the dominance of the human spirit. <br /> <br />It is simply amazing that Chimamanda is only 28 years' old -- she was born 7 years after the war ended. Yet she tells her story with a level of insight, maturity, compassion, knowledge and deftness that belies her age. It is abundantly clear that her writing is the product of tremendous research on her part of the events that led up to and including the civil war. This is fiction based on facts - or \\"faction.\\" <br /> <br />Chimamanda's characters are seen in every day life in Nigeria. Ugwu exists in several houseboys in Nigeria with ambition and intelligence who continue to rise by dint of application of their brains and hard work and focus to attainment of lives of accomplishment. Ugwu's sense of ownership of his Master, Madam and Baby is quite widespread among faithful houseboys. Odenigbo - the professor of mathematics at University of Nigeria, Nsukka -- is the quintessential intellectual, perhaps, with his head caught up in the clouds with numerous ideological constructs and deconstructs. Kainene and Olanna are extremely human characters whose sisterly relationship with each other ironically blossomed in the midst of the war - and became warmer as they came to experience the horrors of the civil war together. Richard comes across as familiarly tragic - wanting to belong to and in Biafra and never belonging or never accepted as belonging. <br /> <br />Which brings us to the concept of belonging. It is a concept that Chimamanda explores in her novel. Miss Adebayo was never seen as belonging; and of course, neither was Richard. Indeed, the Igbos who had lived in the Northern part of Nigeria for several decades were never seen as belonging. Nor were the Igbos who had lived in Lagos: Chinua Achebe escaped death in Lagos during the massacre of Igbos by a hairsbreadth. The parallels between Igbos and the Jews are really striking. Belonging is a potent concept; witness the current acrimonious debate raging in the industrialized countries over immigration, which is inextricably linked to who belongs and who does not. <br /> <br />This is a story that has universal applications even as it is largely set in Igbo land. It tells the story of political conflict and war and love and hate and betrayal and oppression and human affirmation that is contemporary and resonates with the human condition. <br /> <br />It will be eminently interesting to see how this \\"transcendent novel\\" in the words of Publishers Weekly  - which has been received with great literary acclaim in the United States and Europe - will be received in Nigeria. It is safe to predict that it will be seen in certain quarters through dogmatic lenses that will uncritically seek to brazenly question the novel's premises. But this will be largely besides the point - because Chimamanda has rendered a classic and has told a story about a historical necessity - the defense of and by a people from being wiped out from the face of the map. <br /> <br />Just a few quibbles. It was 20 and not 50 pounds that was vengefully decreed by the Government of Nigeria as the amount to be (and which was) given in exchange for all the money held by each former Biafran. Before the war, Cross River Igbos would have been referred to as Bende people and not Imo people. And the settlement in Port-Harcourt would have been called Umuokirisi and not Rumuokirisi - that came after the war. But these are mere quibbles and do not affect the historical accuracy of the novel regarding the lives and times of the Igbos before and during the civil war. <br /> <br />Chimamanda has rightly been described as the 21st-century successor to Chinua Achebe, and she indeed displays the same sophisticated simplicity in her writing and similar deep historical insights laced with philosophical wisdom. Indeed, Achebe describes her as being \\"endowed with the gift of ancient storytellers\\" and asserts that she \\"came almost fully made.\\" The serious bent of her writings is to be widely applauded. There surely is a literary ferment afoot among young Nigerian writers in the diaspora. And Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is at the crest of that ferment. To end with Achebe's words: In writing Half of a Yellow Sun, \\"Adichie knows what is at stake and what to do about it.\\" <br />

B000FUF6QS|5.0|I had seen this movie maybe 25 years ago, and it had stood out in my memory for the brilliance of its performances and its haunting mood of increasing psychological tension.  So I rented it recently from Netflix just to see how it looks with the passage of time.  Some movies age better than others, and I wanted to see if Wicker Man was as good as my recollection of it.<br /><br />I am delighted to say I think the movie holds up very well; it is a classic of its genre and I highly recommend it to movie fans who enjoy psychological thrillers.<br /><br />The details of the plot are well known: a devoutly Christian policeman, played by Edward Woodward in a superlative performance, is summoned to a remote island to track down a report of a missing young girl.  From the start, he encounters a passive/aggressive mixture of social civility but strong resistance to his investigation, coupled with the repeated warning that he's in over his head and doesn't understand what he's getting into.<br /><br />Although he's given different and contradictory explanations, the most frequent version is that the girl doesn't exist -- even though he finds clear signals he is being lied to, which affronts his clearly developed sense of wrong.<br /><br />As he begins his investigation, he is also confronted with abundant evidence that the residents of this isle are most clearly not Christian, that they worship a vaguely Druidic and pagan cult that embraces frank sexuality.  To our repressed policeman, this overt sexualism, coupled with what he believes to be direct deceptions about the missing girl, causes him to believe that the residents are engaged in an evil conspiracy of silence.  And in his repressed fury, he feels a moral duty to get to the bottom of the mystery.  Eventually he does so, of course, to his great dismay.<br /><br />Purely from a story-telling perspective, this is a terrific movie.  There isn't a wasted scene.  Every scene yields another clue or another perspective on the villagers, and the photography has a highly naturalistic, almost documentary feel.  As the clues pile up, pressure heightens on the policeman, leading inevitably to the film's spectacular denouement.  Some of the reviewers have complained about the pace; they say the movie moves much too slowly.  I don't agree; the whole point is to let the tension build slowly but inexorably.  Although this movie preceded it, the intentionally langorous pace reminds me of Picnic at Hanging Rock.<br /><br />The photography is quite good, and has the good sense to simply back off and let you enjoy the austere beauty of this island, from its little seaside village to its craggy shoreline.  You can tell that Wicker Man was shot with a very limited number of cameras; there aren't a lot of jump cuts and reaction shots, even in the tavern scene.  While that is doubtless partly a function of the limited budget, it is also clear that it is a directorial choice. The mise-en-scene is intended to let the story come to a slow but steady boil  To modern viewers, the pace may seem poky and slow, but this is a movie you have to take on its own terms.  You can always rent Days of Thunder again if you need a fix of crash-bang.ctive on the villagers, and the photography has a highly naturalistic, almost documentary feel.

0790729393|5.0|This film deals with a topic that continually arises in our culture, the sexual molestation of children by adults in authority positions. In some ways the film compliments the more contemporary film \\"Mysterious Skin\\" which deals with a similar theme. I will first discuss an overall assessment of the film and then return to the theme of sexual molestation and the long path to recovery from sexual molestation. <br /> <br />As a dramatic engaging film, this product is very good. The acting of Robert DeNero, Kevin Bacon, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Brad Pitt, and Dustin Hoffman is super. DeNero is wonderful as the priest put in an ethical dilemna. Jason Patric holds the second half of the film together as the most psychologically sound of the victims. Kevin Bacon is creepy and realistic as the sadistic molester. Dustin Hoffman is a rare talent as he plays an incompetent alcoholic drug addicted second rate lawyer. Also note that the child actors were very good also. The plot is well developed and engaging, especially the division of the film into childhood and adulthood experiences. The Count of Monte Cristo by Dumas is also used as a unifying theme of imprisonment, escape, planned revenge, and redemption from pain. The cinematography was very good (notice the camera angels and techniques used on the city streets, the courtroom, and especially in the youth facility) and sound track (with serious almost tragic overtones) are first rate. Overall the film gets 5 out of 5 points. <br /> <br />The theme of sexual molestation of children by adults is a difficult and disturbing topic. In this film, 4 boys are molested, with two emerging as angry killers and two emerging with intact emotional stability. Brad Pitt plays the young lawyer who uses the court room to unearth the sexual crimes committed by several guards in the correctional facility. Jason Patric however plays the victim with the the strongest emotional stability and who is capable of developing lovingrelationships and moving forward with his life. Revenge was the theme that holds the second half of the film together, carefully plotted and executed by two of the victims, impulsively and self defeating by the other two.  <br /> <br />A fine film worthy of your time.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I have to say I was hooked on this album from the first listen.  'MC' has really outdone himself this time.  There is not a bad track on the entire CD. This is a definite MUST OWN for any Enigma fan, as well as anyone who is into meditational or mood music.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Simply stated, this album is remarkable.  As the liner notes attest, the sound reflects the extraordinary talent of a \\"young band\\" that merely changed the world. With an articulate and masterful touch from George and Giles Martin, the mixing of so many outstanding Beatles songs into such a cohesive \\"set\\" leads you to believe you are listening to a magnificent new body of work from the group. A fresh and amazing approach to songs that have filled my life for the past 40 plus years.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|I loved this reimagining of the Beatles but I've got a question that I hope someone could answer.  When I play the DVD-audio disc on my DVD-audio player (on a stereo system) I'm given no option to listen to a high resolution stereo mix.  I thought a seperate Hi-res stereo track was required.  When I put the disc in a regular DVD player the \\"audio\\" option pops up and I can choose PCM stereo.  But not on my DVD-A player (Yamaha DVD-C750).  Every other disc I own has a hi-res stereo option offered in \\"setup\\".  No such \\"bullet point\\" appears on the Yamaha for this disc.  Is Apple ignoring the rules, or am I wrong about that.

B000H7JCG4|5.0|Dear Buyers; <br /> <br />Love,Love,Loved this dvd. Brought back memories when telvision was good, Yeah the original music is no longer there but look who bought the rights to the DVD (CBS) Poor FOX for whatever reasons did not buy the rights and I guess would not let CBS use the original aired music hate to admit it guys but alot of dvds end up in this fate due to other studios getting the rights first(Example:Baywatch,Dawson's Creek). However, all of the fond memories are there including all the cheesiness of the early 90's,lol. if you were a fan of the series, with original music or not buy this dvd you wont regret it. As for an earlier review that states that the episodes were on there more then once and are not in order, must have been his DVD set, mine is fine and includes all original episodes in order of air date and is in the finest quality borght to dvd for this series, Still looks grainy but I like that due to te fact that it did come from TV and it makes it original and back in the day when this series started there was no HDTV so suck it up and relive 90210.

0670038040|4.0|For those of us who are Rumpole enthusiasts, it's a pleasure to once again have Horace Rumpole on his hind legs in court defending the rights of the innocent and the not so innocent. This time Rumpole's case is right out of the headlines when he defends a Pakistani doctor accused of terrorism. The doctor is incarcerated without being provided charges against him under a series of new British post 911 laws. Of course this gets up the hackles of 'champagne socialist\\" Mortimer and Rumpole his mouthpiece. The result is Rumpole spouting a lot of simplistic thinking on the proper handling of terrorists. However no one reads Rumpole with too much concern about philosophy or plot. What Mortimer shines at is his deft charactizations and piquant sense of humor. Mortimer does not disappoint on this score. She Who Must Be Obeyed contemplates an affair with Rumpole's arch nemesis Mad Judge Bullingham. The Timson clan is up to its old tricks. Hilda's old school chum Dodo Macintosh comes for a visit and Horace's Portia, Justice Phillida Erksine Brown attempts to get Rumpole to give up on saving his doctor client.

0790729369|5.0|A most surprising approach of mid-life love for a mother and wife, though seen by a male director apparently well supported or supplemented by some women in the team. What happens if for four days you are alone, but not abandoned, and meet a man that reveals to you that there can be some new love in your life even though this life of yours is satisfied, happy, well-balanced and characterized by no particular need nor want, nor even, as for that, wish, except maybe the desire to listen to and enjoy some classical music, some opera singing - and it could be anything at all - which is not appreciated by the other members of the family ? That is rather light as for discontentment or dissatisfaction. A short-lived love affair develops during and over these four days and you are confronted to the need to make a decision. The situation has already been considered by many and in many films. You break off and away and let yourself go with that love affair. Then later on you regret what you have lost in the process. Or you resist and do not yield and you regret all your life what you have not done. In both case you enjoy what you have taken or kept and you are divided between the two sides of your decision : does what I have taken or kept balance what I have rejected, refused or let go ? The film is thus not particularly innovative by its theme. Yet it has a special perfume, fragrance. What is it ? Certainly not the reaction of the children when they learn about it after your death. Their reactions are predictable and even superficial. The special value of this film is in fact in the two actors and the way they embody, with their body acting, the meeting of two potentials, the passion and the end of it, the loss of it and yet the survival of it. Apart from this marvellously well rendered flesh of the film the subject is banal. Meryl Streep particularly transcends her part and takes us into the deepest layers of her mind the way they ripple on her surface, on the surface of her body and behaviour. We feel her disarray at first, her fascination then and her conservative sacrifice last in the most humane and subtle way. We are suffering and rejoicing with her and each side of her situation or decision has its lot of suffering and its lot of rejoicing. That's why this film should be kept in mind and remembered.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonner body and behaviour.

0385751060|4.0|John Boyne is the author of the historical novels, \\"Crippen\\" which deals with a notorious London murder, and \\"The Congress of Rough Riders\\" which is about Buffalo Bill.  His short novel, \\"The Boy in Striped Pajamas\\" is a historical novel about yet a third time and place. It is a story of the Holocaust.  It is a good short read -- I read the book through in a sitting and during my reading was absorbed -- but less than compelling.<br /><br />The book is largely written eliptically and with understatement.  The author wants the enormity of the Holocaust to dawn upon the reader through indirection. The chapters flow together well and the writing, while mannered and repetitive in places, is good on the whole.  Something of the Holocaust and its terror come through in the book even though the story line is predictable and banal. (I was reminded of Hannah Arendt's phrase \\"the banality of evil\\" in reading this book.)<br /><br />The chief character of the book is Bruno, a nine-year old German boy whose father is a high-ranking Nazi and on good terms with Hitler (called \\"the Fury\\" in the book.) When he becomes Commandant at Auschwitz (again, referred to as \\"Out-With\\"), the family must leave their large home in Berlin.  Bruno is bored with life at Auschwitz and misses his three former \\"best friends for life\\" in Berlin.  He harasses his twelve year old sister, Gretel, (the \\"hopeless case\\") until, wandering around on his own he comes across the boundary of the camp and meets a Jewish inmate on the other side of the fence wire.  The inmate is a boy of Bruno's own age from Krakow named Shmuel.  Shmuel is dressed in the striped pajamas of Auschwitz prisoners, although Bruno does not understand the significance of the pajamas or of Shmuel's life in the camp.  The two boys become friends.<br /><br />The brutality of the Holocaust comes through in the seemingly ordinary home life of the Commandant and his family, the naievity of the children, especially Bruno, and in the Commandant's military assistants, especially a young soldier named Lieutenant Kotler.  I was moved by the story, and by Bruno's fate, on an individual level.  But I found I didn't learn anything new about the Holocaust, and the book didn't get me to think about the Holocaust in a different, revealing way.<br /><br />There is some question about the intended audience for this book.  I read it for an adult book group, and there wasn't quite enough in the book to make it rewarding for that use.  The book appears to be written for adolescent readers as an introduction to the Holocaust and its causes.  The book is readable and the story line is good.  The book may indeed encourage some young readers to think about the Holocaust. But even for young readers, I am afraid this will not be an especially memorable book.  It is strained, and I can't escape the feeling of triteness.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanecially a young soldier named Lieutenant Kotler.

At times it is a wild Beatles party and at other moments, an introspective solitude. All the vocals have a new smooth silky warmth while retaining a clarity that is stunning. What I noticed about the artistic creative force within this album is the connections and transitions (especially between tracks 24 and 25) that show inspired considerations.<br /><br />\\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" is superior and it effortlessly merges into \\"Drive My Car.\\" Even when one track fades out, an ambient moment will appear as if from the mist. \\"Something\\" is richly layered and infused with subtle nostalgia. The haunting soundscape of winds sweeping across ice dramatically changes into \\"HELP!\\" I'm completely fascinated with the transitions on this album. In \\"Within You Without You\\" there are echoes of the past and future in a fusion of ocean sounds, like birds taking off in all directions from a lapis sea.<br /><br />This is where it gets even better because the songs merge and \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" suddenly appears and at times melts into melodious metamorphosis where sounds seems to be bubbles within bubbles that suddenly burst, while others float down to the ground, leaving the song more grounded with percussion. The transition from Octopus's Garden to Lady Madonna is like a thunderstorm.<br /><br />My computer speakers don't do this album justice, nor will my portable stereo ever spin this CD!

B00005JPCD|4.0|'Happy Feet' is an animated feature that has some dizzying animation effects.  Sitting there in the theatre, I thought at times that I was watching an I-Max feature.  (And at times I was glad I wasn't, which leads me to believe that the cries of one young theatre-goer, indicate it may be too intense for younger viewers.)  For the rest of us over seven, there is a good, although familiar, story of the misfit penguin.  \\"Mumble\\" (played with proper insecurity by the voice of the Hobbit, Elijah Wood) does what comes naturally.  Having some latent pre-hatched anomolies, he comes out ready to dance rather than sing.  It alienates him from his community and his love interest, Gloria (played with sexy voice by Brittany Murphy).  His loner pursuit gets him in another fold.  (In this case they're alien penguins with Spanish accents.)  The elders disaprove of the alien assimilation, reasoning that too many mouths to feed will stretch community resources too thin.  (Sound familiar?)  The development is often episodic with harrowing enemies--like a sea lion--and songs that burst out at the drop of an iceburg.  (Just like other musicals, characters burst out in song for the weather--or, in this case Northern Lights, and falling in love--or, again, mating season.)  The bursts of songs are decent to splendid.  (This film is worth every penny for watching the penguins dive into arctic waters from great heights while the full stereo spendour of the Beach Boys' \\"Do It Again\\" pipes through the digital sound.)      The main plot has a point and a destination.  Mumble meets into Lovelace (Robin Williams) who is the penguin guru.  (Much of the movie makes political points, for he wears an involuntary necklace made from a plastic six-pack ring.)  He is short on advice, but Mumble has the messianic touch to go solo on a trek to discover the aliens (man) and solve the mystery of the disappearing food supply.  \\"Happy Feet\\" Mumble tries to bridge that gap and bring home the bacon (or in this case, sardines).  While I either respect or agree with the viewpoints of the film, I sometimes think it would be more effective if they \\"chilled out\\" a little bit.  Besides that, 'Happy Feet' is an irresistible animated musical drama/comedy.  (Robin Williams does three voices, including Mumble's main homie, Ramon, which sounds like Williams' comedy portrayal of Ricardo Maltoban.)
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Well boys, you've made it to the big time...and what an entrance you've made!  Every great artist has THE record that not only pushes them into super stardom, but paradoxically, makes it difficult for them to ever out do themselves.  For U2 it was 'The Joshua Tree' for Green Day it was 'American Idiot' and for MCR it is 'The Black Parade'.  Difference is, it's coming much earlier in their career than it does for most bands. <br />This album is fantastically brillant, with guitar riffs that take you for a delicious spin, lyrics that you can't help but shout out while driving through blah suburbia, and bass and drums that keep your heart pulsing and your adrenaline pumping.  Today, the hard rock genre gains a formidible addition to it's ranks.  I feel inspired, alive, and intrigued when this album is playing.   <br />Expect this to be album of the year on MANY lists and for many awards.  Expect long lines for hard to come by concert tickets.  Expect MCR to leave the status of an 'almost made it band' and graduate to the position of full fledged, worshipped, and idolized rock stars. <br />And one more thing...play this album as loud as your neighbors, speakers and ears will allow.  Enjoy!
B00005JPC7|5.0|And what a comedy it is, smart, fresh and a true delight I was completely content upon walking out of the theater last Saturday night, knowing full well that my decision to skip `Happy Feet' and take a chance on this Will Ferrell comedy was justified.  I'm not saying that `Happy Feet' is a bad movie, I can't say that for I have not seen it, but I doubt I will like it this much,  I have been waiting to see `Stranger than Fiction' for a few months now, being a huge fan of 2004's `Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind' as well as being a huge fan of Will Ferrell and hearing all the buzz, strong buzz, not only of script but of concept and overall quality of film I just couldn't resist. <br /> <br />The story of Harold Crick (Ferrell) is a simple one.  He's an IRS agent who has done nothing in his life he's particularly fond of.  He lives for his work and his work alone.  He has no friends besides Dave (Tony Hale) \\"this guy I work with\\" who he barely speaks with and never on a social level.  He lives alone, eats alone, sleeps alone...that is until a woman's voice takes up residence inside his head.  He begins to hear her narrating his life, his decisions, his feelings and intimate thoughts and he begins to go slowly insane.  And then she announces that he is soon going to die.  Harold is now on edge, worried that his life is soon to end, and so he begins to seek help from anyone who will give it. <br /> <br />This help comes in the form of Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), a literary professor determined to find out whether Harold is living in a tragedy or a comedy.  Beginning with a series of pointless questions (as in \\"do you have superpowers\\") Jules slowly begins to dwindle down the possibilities and comes up with a list of authors he believes could be writing the story of his life.  But when he finds out it is not one of the few he suggested but is in fact his idol Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) Jules is alarmed for Karen always kills off her hero, always. <br /> <br />Upon realizing his days are numbered Harold decides to truly live his life.  He learns to play guitar, which he later shows us by struggling through a rendition of `Whole Wide World'.  He also begins to pursue a relationship with a beautiful young baker named Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a woman who initially despised him but has grown to love him for the man he is underneath.  On the other hand we have Karen who is suffering from an extreme case of writers block, for she just can't figure out `how' she will kill Harold.  To help, her publishers send her Penny Escher (Queen Latifah), a writer's assistant who is determined to help her `kill' Harold. <br /> <br />Thanks in large part to the impressive cast, `Stranger than Fiction' delivers an original one of a kind comedy that is sure to please any fan of the genre.  Will Ferrell performs against type proving that he's more than just a big kid; he can be serious and yet still hold out attention.  Unlike some viewers and critics I found him far from boring.  Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah were a perfect team, working off of each other brilliantly, and Emma does stand out here as the most memorable character.  Maggie has just had a killer year this year, and while her Ana isn't as brilliant as her Sherry (from `Sherrybaby') or her Alison (from `World Trade Center') she still delivers a sweet, funny and believable love interest for Harold, and believe it or not Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal have great chemistry. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a smart and original comedy, one that will make you laugh and make you smile and, in the long run, really make you think then this is the movie for you.  It may present the same \\"seize the day\\", \\"live for now\\", \\"take the risks your afraid to take\\" type message that a lot of movies today are presenting, but `Stranger than Fiction' does so with a unique twist that is all it's own, and in that way it seems original even if the moral is not.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I'd first heard of Incubus about 6 years ago, initially scoffing at their pop-rock singles like Stellar and Drive, but after a friend introduced me to SCIENCE, I'd fallen in love, and every album since had become a classic to me.  A Crow Left of the Murder took some time to really grow on me, but once it did, I realized how amazing it was, both musically and lyrically (even if it doesn't exactly flow well at times), and what a major step up it was for the band.  But now I found myself at a point where I thought - how could Incubus tops itself once again?  There's no way the next album could top or even equal up to their previous efforts. <br /> <br />Well I guess I was wrong for doubting them, but Incubus has once again done it with Light Grenades, their most diverse album to date.  Where as ACLOTM had a few songs that matched each other, very few songs here sound anything similar to any of the others, unless of course you're considering both parts of Earth to Bella. <br /> <br />The opening track, Quicksand, is very atmospheric and spacy sounding and reminiscent to mid-70's Pink Floyd.  Coincidentally, in Floyd fashion, the song segues into A Kiss To Send Us Off, a hard-hitting track that's sure to please many fans of Incubus' harder material.  The track bears a lot of resemblence to Megalomaniac, which makes it probably the closest thing to old Incubus on the whole album, but it still very unique in it's own right. <br /> <br />Next up is the very catchy \\"Dig,\\" laced with acoustic guitars and piano, and would probably make for a very successful single.  Then comes the current single, \\"Anna Molly,\\" which I think needs no explanation amongst a lot of Incubus fans.  Very awesome song, and is something very new to the band, without losing the Incubus feel.  \\"Love Hurts\\" is a very spacy ballad-like song, and probably the catchiest on the whole album, and is one of my favorites.  Oddly enough, it's followed by the album's hardest song, and possibly Incubus' hardest songthus far, \\"Light Grenades.\\"  Another sure pleaser to fans of old Incubus, and almost a throw back to the days of SCIENCE. <br /> <br />\\"Earth to Bella (Part 1)\\" starts off as a nice acoustic song, before erupting into an explosion of guitar, bass, and drums, then going back into acoustic mode, and eventually building up into the songs climax, before finally fading with a nice acoustic riff into \\"Oil and Water,\\" another great song which defies explanation.  \\"Diamonds and Coal\\" is one of the most unusual songs here, as it sounds almost like an 80's pop-rock throwback, similar to The Police, but is very catchy, and Incubus makes it work as usual.  \\"Rogues\\" is another Incubus rocker which packs a lot of energy, and would definitely be great to see live.  \\"Paper Shoes,\\" with the exception of Brandon's vocals, has a Led Zeppelin acoustic feel to it, Mike even admitting it had a Led Zeppelin III acoustic sound to it. <br /> <br />Pendulous Threads has to be the most experimental song on the whole album, buidling up with an odd-sounding guitar riff.  About halfway through the song, Mike goes into a very spacy sounding solo.  Finally, the song fades out on the same riff it came in on, then leads into Earth to Bella (Part 2), which is just a reprise of the first, more mellow sounding than the first one, and finally draws the album to a close. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this is Incubus best album yet. If you're a fan of music that tries new things, this is definitely worth checking out. <br /> <br />

B000ICM5VW|3.0|This movie was the main reason I bought into the whole HD DVD thing.  As one of my favorites of 2005, I highly anticipated its release to HD, especially since I figured it would get one heck of a treatment.  I was right about part of it; the A/V quality is among the best I've seen, despite the lack of a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It's definitely the title I'd use to show off what HD DVD can do; however, the lack of extras is a little disappointing, mainly because Amazon has it priced so darn high.  27 bucks is way too much for the title, when other new releases have sub-$20 price tags. <br /> <br />Bottom line: the HD DVD comes highly recommended, but only if you can get it for a more reasonable price.
0743289412|2.0|I clawed my way to the end of this book, but it was tough going.  King, who possesses a genuine literary talent that he didn't use consistently for years, has more recently attempted to write in a more \\"literary\\" fashion, but his prose (and particularly his penchant for long interior monologues) have begun to overwhelm his narratives. There is no reason why a strong horror plot and inventive, sensitive prose cannot co-exist -- King has proven that they can -- but a careful balance is necessary.  \\"Lisey's Story\\" doesn't achieve that balance.  The plot, such as it is, is weak and obscured by the effects, which largely seem to exist for their own sake rather than to explicate story and character. <br /> <br />The book is a love story intersecting with a horrific personal history, and Lisey herself is an appealing heroine, but not enough to overcome the many problems.  Reluctantly not recommended.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Defenders is often said to be one of the best Priest albums, And their right.

B000GFLE86|5.0|Quiet, insightful versions of good songs. Not quite lounge, not quite pop, not quite jazz, the record interprets from Ms. Peyroux's perspective, and that's a very good thing. Assuming your circle of friends is over 40 ad lucid, it would be hard to find anyone who wouldn't like this CD. A dozen songs, several recognizable from original or hit versions by artists ranging from Tom Waits to Glen Campbell.<br /><br />A treasure. That's all there is to it. A treasure.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Although there is no new material on this new CD, George and Giles Martin's remixing and new blending of Beatles material is really an exiting journey through all stages of the band's career.<br /><br />The new remastering has made the music sound crisp and clear and the Martins' new \\"arrangements\\" of the songs has given the music a new and exciting feel.<br /><br />A few passages may have a little \\"Stars of 45\\" to them, but generally it's a pleasure to listen the Beatles' music in a new way.<br /><br />It's about time all the Beatles original albums are remastered, because playing one of their CD releases of the 1990's after this new album is bound to be a dull experience ( soundwise ) - and this new CD can obviously in no way replace the originals.<br /><br />It really doesn't make sense to bring out any specific tracks as the album is very much meant to be listened to as a whole - I can help thinking what a magnificent movie ( with original Beatles footage and videos ) could be made with this album.
0316236535|5.0|With a book like this it is helpful to define what you want to get out of the book.  Like several other reviews have mentioned there is not much in the way of plot.  However, I don't think the focus of this book should be plot development.  This book is about POWER.  The power to face scary things, and even the scariest thing of all... the unknown.  Through the facinating technique of using dicut pages a monster's face is slowly built, adding one feature at a time.  Then, using the same technique, is slowly faded away while the text (and the children experiencing this book)tell each feature to \\"GO AWAY.\\" It is very fun and empowering.   <br />An added bonus is also that the author uses many descriptive words to identify the parts of the big green monster.  Young children get a lot of fun practice in expanding their vocabulary as they repeat the descriptive words.   <br />I highly recommend this book for preschool aged children.
B00006AW2M|4.0|I think this is a decent album. I will admit, it's no Stones album, but the contributions from Brian Jones are simply amazing on their own. This album is, in my opinion, a great effort put out by Brian Jones. It dabbles in the different sounds that were considered psychedelic at the time, possibly still now.  <br /> <br />The experimentations that Brian was interested in at the time included many different instruments that were widely unknown, if not, un-popular at the time. He plays the Mellotron in \\"She's a Rainbow\\" and \\"2000 Light Years from Home.\\" In fact, \\"2000 Light Years from Home\\" was initially going to be left off of the album until Jones added the Mellotron to it.  <br /> <br />In \\"Gomper\\" Jones plays a plethera of intruments, to include all percussive instruments, sitar, tamboura, flute, and organ in a fairly long instrumental section.  <br /> <br />As for \\"She's a Rainbow\\", I've seen a lot of people mention that it is the only good song on the album, or that it's one of a few good ones. These same people also mention the Beatles in their reviews. And it's hard not to compare this album to Sgt. Pepper's, but this isn't Sgt. Pepper's. It's not the same sound, and Sgt. Pepper's may have been the sound the Stones were looking for, but I doubt it. Yet, not too many people mention that the backing vocals on \\"She's a Rainbow\\" is none other than John Lennon and Paul McCartney. John Paul Jones also arranged the strings. The ol' Lennon/McCartney can also be heard in both \\"Sing this All Together\\" and \\"Sing this All Together (See What Happens).\\" <br /> <br />With Lennon and McCartney on the album, yea it helps it a bit. I still don't think it's the Stones sound, nor the Beatles sound. It's a distinct sound, and had the cover been different, I think people and critics would not have jumped on the Sgt. Pepper's copyright bus.

B000JJS8TM|4.0|LOVE, the \\"new\\" Beatles album. Sorry, but it strikes me as being, as I'd feared, a gimmick: How many fragments can you count and identify? I'm sure Sir George and his son, Son of Sir George, had a blast for the two or more years they allegedly spent on this project, but I can't see that it's of any value. Sure, the sound is marvelous. You'd never know the primitive [by today's standards] equipment the tracks were originally recorded on. But why? <br /> <br />It certainly has its moments. The backwards \\"Here Comes the Sun King\\" leading into the already perfect \\"Something\\" is haunting and quite lovely. And the new version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" a fully acoustic recording by George Harrison over which Sir George layered some beautiful and unobtrusive string work, is breathtaking. (Compare it, say, with the too-ambitious strings Nelson Riddle wrote for the Sinatra version.) These two tracks are for me worth the price of admission. Nothing else is. <br /> <br />It could in a sense be considered the ultimate Beatles album...if you think of the Beatles as the studio creators they were in the end. It's really more the ultimate studio technicians' album. If you favor the earlier incarnation of the Beatles when they were a crack rock band, this is hardly satisfying. <br /> <br />In fact, that may be the key word: satisfying. It isn't, because it's so fragmented and so pretentious. It keeps calling attention to itself. It's Sir George and son being oh-so-clever with the music of the greatest band ever. Nothing is in any sense improved...except \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" which isn't really an improvement so much as a new version. <br /> <br />The album is certainly not going to open up a new audience for the Beatles. What it may do is open up a can of worms: What other classics can we tamper with. The higher the tech, the harder the fall. <br /> <br />Of course, Ringo and Paul and Yoko and Olivia will realize a great windfall from this...as if they needed moremoney! <br />
B00002E23E|5.0|What can you say about THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME--or Led Zeppelin for that matter--some 30 years after the film's release?  Everybody pretty much knows where he (or she, but let's be honest, we're mostly talking 'he's' here) stands on all things Zep. For those who never saw the band live (like me), it certainly gives you a taste of what that experience was like.  But then, I'm told that the DVD more recently compiled by Jimmy Page did a better job at that. <br /> <br />But still, this performance film/cum documentary/cum pre-MTV video fest captures an era in the group's history and our own in its own unique fashion.  I was never an ueber-fan, so maybe it's not really for me to say, but I, for one, did not come away from this film feeling too disappointed. <br /> <br />Some maintain that SONG really would have been much better had it simply been a performance film, with no pretensions.  But actually, there have been VERY few pure performance docs historically.  Even the best concert films (THE LAST WALTZ,say) usually throw in a least a few documentary elements, a la WOODSTOCK.  And it can give the viewer a better sense of place (here NYC) and time (1973).  The documentary elements give some flavor of the rock'n'roll life as it was lived by both musicians AND fans.  And it does so more by presenting random clips of backstage life than by interviews.  It speaks volumes to me that in one scene, security is letting a couple of kids sneak backstage with  a proverbial nod and a wink, and in another, someone--who may have been a little drunker, more high or otherwise more disorderly--is being chased down like a (black)dog. <br /> <br />And all those shots of the NYC skyline in 1973 register in a very strange way in these post-9/11 times.  Those towers were pretty new back then. <br /> <br />As for the much reviled \\"fantasy\\" sequences.  Well, I admit, I'd probably prefer to see more live sequences myself.  But they really do serve as a precursor to the video-era (and you'llrecall that the first videos weren't exactly big budget spectaculars either, so having Robert Plant in medieval garb ride around on horseback for a couple of minutes or having Jimmy Page scaling a mysterious mountain, only to meet up with a mysterious warlock (who looks, again mysteriously, like his own bad self) is scarcely any sillier than what was being broadcast 24 hours a day on \\"Music Television\\" a few years later.  As a bridge between psychedelia and the MTV era, THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME is an invaluable document. <br /> <br />Besides would a full length performance film really have been everything some fans seem to imagine it could have been?  I don't think so.  At some point, I concluded that the cinematographer must have had a mad crush on Robert Plant.  The shots of his, uh, torso were getting a little monotonous.  And poor John Paul Jones is all but ignored in the live shots.  He gets a few moments where he's fingering the fretboard, before the camera action is once again lovingly diverted back to Page and Plant.  Well, they were the showmen after all.  And this was quite the show. <br /> <br />For good or ill, depending on your point of view.  At the time, as I recall, I was just purist enough to think that I could have done with less 'show' and more of the musicianship I knew the group was capable of.  But looking at the film in 2006, I'm more \\"que era, era.\\"  It was what it was.  And it's worth a look. <br /> <br />
0743289412|5.0|Lisey's Story isn't a different direction for King, it's just kind of like looking at the same thing, but through a different window.  It's a love story with monsters, a horror story with sentiment, and easily the most beautifully written novel that King has produced. He draws creativity and madness so close together that they almost touch in a way that only someone who himself creates can do. <br /> <br />As mentioned, the first portion of the book is slow and takes a while to get through.  However, it sets the tone for the life Lisey has created since her husband's death.  It's taking her a while to deal with the loss of her husband, of their life together, and secrets they shared.  Some of those secrets are typical of those shared in any marriage, and some deal with things no one but themselves would understand.  As she deals with her monsters, sometimes dealing with his monsters, things pick up more for both of us. <br /> <br />Ultimately heartbreaking, but so, so beautiful, so very typically King and so very different at the same time, Lisey's Storey is one you won't want to miss. <br />

It is the only one i've been listening to ever since it came out.

He has created a masterpeice. <br />
B000J103WK|5.0|This works great on the RCA HD-DVD player, and is an incredible disk.  Highly recommended.  The sound and the video quality are first-rate and the guys are still rocking!  Some of Joe Walsh and Don Henley's efforts seem to have been absorbed into the Eagles catalog now and sound excellent, and all the old Eagles classics are there as well.

B000JBXXZ4|3.0|For the better part of a decade, Incubus has been one of my favorite bands and, by far, my favorite mainstream rock band. Brandon Boyd still remains one of the few vocalists in rock music today who can carry a tune outside of a studio and whose talent relies on actual ability rather than the skill of a producer. Furthermore, Mike Einziger is still a force to be reckoned with on guitar. For the most part, Incubus has constantly evolved since their funk rock roots over a decade ago. Six albums later, and Incubus hardly seems like they are ready to throw in the towel. They are still one of the most beloved bands out there, even if the mainstream media has never really given the kind of attention they shelled out to lesser, now-gone bands. For better or for worse, \\"Light Grenades\\" continues Incubus' trend of changing their sound from album to album. The result is a mixed-bag for the hardcore Incubus fan, but shows that Incubus still has what it takes to make it in an industry that is steadily being overrun by the under-talented and over-produced.<br /><br />\\"Quicksand\\" is the lead-off track here, and from the very beginning, you pretty much know that you're in for a different Incubus experience. As far as I can recall, this is the first Incubus album to not start with a loud, rocking song. However, it sets the mood for the album quite well. Boyd is definitely at his most poignant here when he sings, \\"Some people fall in love and touch the sky. Some people fall in love and find quicksand!\\" And love is a focal point on the album, as we'll soon find out, so it makes sense to begin the album this way.<br /><br />The next track, \\"A Kiss to Send Us off\\" takes us to familiar Incubus grounds. If the guitar riff sounds a bit familiar at first, it's probably because it bares an small resemblance to \\"Megalomaniac.\\" But that riff is over soon enough, and the music that replaces it during the verse is entrancing enough to make you forget it even existed, at least momentarily. Boyd doesn't really display his vocal talents all too well when he punk-sings \\"A kiss to send us off!\\" It's a bit reminiscent of more terrible vocalists out there today, like Tom DeLong. It's definitely my only real gripe with the song, however, and \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off\\" is definitely a high-point on the album.<br /><br />\\"Dig\\" is currently the song I'm most impressed with on \\"Light Grenades.\\" It's not Incubus' most impressive song, by any means, but it could be their most poignant to date. Here, Brandon belts \\"If I turn into another, dig me up from under what is covering the better part of me! Sing this song. Remind me that we'll always have each other when everything else is gone.\\" Obviously, the love theme is in full-effect here, and it really is a beautiful song.<br /><br />\\"Anna Molly\\" is the next song on the album and it's first single. If you're considering buying this album, you've probably already heard this song. It's got that classic Incubus rock sound, and would be a perfect fit on \\"A Crow Left of the Murder.\\" Mike really hits his peak on this song as far as this album is concerned, which is actually a bit of a downer for me. He's definitely capable of much more, but even here he's much more impressive than many of his contemporaries. \\"Anna Molly\\" was definitely a great choice for the first single. It's fun, it rocks, and it's Incubus, so there's not a whole lot to hate about this one.<br /><br />\\"Love Hurts\\" may be my least favorite song on the album. The song itself seems as if it was ripped right off of bad 1998 alternative rock album (back wen Incubus was tearing it up with \\"A Certain Shade of Green\\"). The song is just as corny and cliched as the title would lead you to believe. Boyd even goes as far to say \\"Without love I won't survive.\\" Even if that's true, it can't really overcome the lyrical travesty that is \\"Love hurts, but sometimes it's a good hurt.\\" While it's true the Boyd has never really been the best lyricist in the world, even he should haveconsidered re-writing this one. Music-wise, it's not all that impressive either. It's definitely a song I could've done without.<br /><br />\\"Light Grenades,\\" the title track, not the album, has a very raw, chaotic feel to it. It barely sounds like Incubus, and pushes more toward The Vines' territory. It's a good thing though, and adds a pretty sizable spark to the fire that \\"Love Hurts\\" just got finished extinguishing. Mike pretty much tears his guitar to pieces here, and Jose goes absolutely psychotic on his drum set! This song is going to be a highlight on the next tour for sure!<br /><br />\\"Earth to Bella Pt. 1\\" is another low point on the album, featuring acoustic guitars and the occasional full-electric freak-out. It's a rather dull song, to be honest. In the end, it seems more like filler than anything else, taking away from the album more than it contributes. Likewise, \\"Oil and Water\\" does much the same thing. Unlike it's predecessor, however, it is more of a traditional alternative rock song, though it would be better suited for a band like \\"Mute Math\\" or even \\"Keane.\\" The biggest flaw of the song is that it lacks a strong, memorable melody, something that Incubus has never really failed to deliver before. It tries to be effective, but it just winds up sounding a lot like another Incubus song, \\"Leech,\\" only without passion or conviction.<br /><br />\\"Rogues\\" is a fairly solid track. At times it feels like it has a very southern rock sound (ala Polarboy, an obscure but decent band). Other times it feels like it's straight out of the Incubus textbook of how to securely rock balls off. Without question, it would be a welcomed addition to an album like \\"Make Yourself,\\" so any Incubus fan who like this song should definitely check out that album if they haven't already (which you really should if you're a \\"fan\\").<br /><br />The next two tracks, \\"Paper Shoes\\" and \\"Pendulous Threads\\" definitely suffer from \\"Oil and Water-syndrome\\" in that they are fairly decent musically, but Brandon ultimately fails in offering a memorable vocal performance. The hooks are forgettable at best, and poorly executed. It's very disheartening, especially since these tracks essentially bring the album to its close. These songs may be more fun live, because you'll feel the energy, but in reality they're not much fun to listen to here, which is a real shame.<br /><br />The final track on the album is \\"Earth to Bella Pt. 2\\" which, you guessed it, sounds pretty much exactly the same as Part 1. The difference here is the coda, or ending, of the song. It's essentially Brandon ooh-ing repeatedly, but eventually more oohs come in and harmonize with the other oohs. Slowly, the oohs drift off into chaotic drums and distorted guitar effects. It's a nice touch to end the album, though I can't help but think that the only reason its there is for that specific purpose. Because, really, it'd be just as ineffectual as Part 1 if it weren't for it's positioning at the end.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Light Grenades\\" is an uncharacteristically light Incubus album. Lighter than \\"Morning View\\" even. It has its high points (\\"Dig,\\" \\"Anna Molly\\") but it also suffers from devastating lows (\\"Oil and Water,\\" \\"Love Hurts\\"). If you're a moderate Incubus fan, by all means, give this album a listen. Compared to other CDs that you could buy for the same price, its one of the best albums of all time. Unfortunately, however, when you compare it to other Incubus album, it may very well be their worst. I may just be a purist, or I may be making a judgment too quickly, but in my opinion the low points on \\"Light Grenades\\" are far more common than the highs. What starts off as a beautiful and refreshing Incubus album, ultimately winds up being boring, unnecessary, and incredibly disappointing. Considering that Incubus typically releases an album every 3 years or so, I'm fortunate to know that I have 5 other solid albums to keep me company until then.<br /><br />Recommended for all Incubus fans. It may not be the best, but it could be much, much worse (Angels and Airwaves).<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br /><br />1. \\"Quicksand\\"<br /><br />2. \\"Dig\\"<br /><br />3. \\"Anna Molly\\"<br /><br />4. \\"Light Grenades\\"<br /><br />5 out of 10 Starsfairly decent musically, but Brandon ultimately fails in offering a memorable vocal performance.

B000000I0C|4.0|Over, released in 1977, known mostly as Peter Hammill's divorce album was written during the breakup of his marriage. With the various themes of resentment, denial, reflection and hope surrounding such a dismal ending, this album is not exactly the kind of music you can pop in any old time. The music itself has an interesting mix straight forward rock (Crying Wolf), simi-progressive rock (Time Heals/ Lost And Found), art rock (Yoga), and gorgeous ballads with only a string section backing him (Autumn/...Looking Glass).<br /><br />Over was in some ways the first of it's kind, being so bare and introspective, approaching such a private matter as the dissolution of a marriage. The only other \\"divorce album\\" I can think of before or around that time is Marvin Gaye's equally excellent Here My Dear which came out a year later, and started out as a contractual obligation rather than an inspired revelation.<br /><br />Peter Hammill is one of the more deftly insightful and introspective singer/songwriters of the last 40 years; the type of thoughtfulness, brilliant wordplay and expression is certainly a rarity of art in this day and age, let alone in the world of rock. As the songwriter and leader of Van Der Graaf Generator as well as numerous solo efforts, Hammill wrote songs that asked all the searching questions about God, existence, relationships, and anything else one might question because of it's seemingly dual nature. Introspective art does not lend itself easily to mass appeal; sometimes too extreme, Hammill's music is not always pretty or agreeable but the integrity and honesty comes out in all it's substance, and purely shows an experience in the human condition.<br /><br />Over was recorded around the same time as the final VDGG studio album of the 70's, The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome. So there are quiet a few similarities to the sound of those two albums; most notably is the use of Graham Smith's violin, and there is a production sensibility that is familiar to both as well; although Over's sound is a great deal more lean than that of The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome.<br /><br />Every song on Over is superb. The real standout is the cinematic This Side Of The Looking Glass with it's chilling string section and amazing ebb and flow of emotions; Peter Hammill's voice had never sounded so vulnerable as it did on this track.<br /><br />Autumn is a tearful realization of the shock of the end of the relationship- all the concerns of splitting their lives in two and the people it will effect- a very moving piece. Betrayed has a great vocal performance and quickly builds into a helpless rant with the violin aiding PH's \\"caught-between-yearning-and-angst\\" lyrics/singing. Yoga is another highlight with its continuing power chord \\"gonging\\" and the aloofly disillusioned guitar solo slowly whizzing in and out of a pretty folk structure.<br /><br />The final song, Lost And Found has a progressive-rock structure and uses the theme of La Rossa (from the VDGG album Still Life) as an interesting reference in a part of the song. Lost And Found puts all the troubled emotions and memories to the past, and sees hope and learned lessons, but leave with a statement that doubles as a question about the future of his life.<br /><br />The new re-mastered albums (both of Hammill and VDGG) sound amazing, clearing up details and showing the fullness of the music.  Include with that some great bonus tracks the new re-mastered Over is well worth the purchase.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Some other albums of Peter Hammill I would recommend are pH7, Nadir's Big Chance, The Future Now, Fool's Mate, and The Silent Corner And Empty Stage; as for VDGG stuff all the albums are superb but some are very different than others- Pawn Hearts or Still Life are pretty good places to start.s familiar to both as well; although Over's sound is a great deal more lean than that of The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome. <br /> <br />Every song on Over is superb.

0060931736|5.0|The spinster has long been a fixture in English literature and life, and the independent, intellectual spinster, Muriel Spark remarks part way through THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE, was not an uncommon sort between the wars in the UK.  What makes Jean Brodie, her independent spinster protagonist, unusual is that she chooses to play out her personal pageant not as a teacher in a progressive school where her eccentric personality and educational strategies would have clicked but at a traditional girls' school in Scotland.  Female teachers were expected to be models of morality and chastity and they were to groom their charges to fit a prescribed code of feminine behavior shaped more by Victorian standards than the 20th century.   <br /> <br />Our Miss Brodie has a very strong sense of self and dramatically casts herself as a heroine in her life's stories that she routinely dispenses to her middle-school aged girls.  They are a captive audience as she reminds them again and again that she is in her prime.  And yet, they are learners and what they come away with is their own sense of selves, albeit stamped by the Brodie spirit, exhibited in the various ways they're able to position the Panama hat that is part of their uniforms; they also know more about culture and politics than their peers.  As time moves on, they also become aware in other ways, and reveal Miss Brodie's mark on them in unexpected ways.  The central tension is, can Miss Brodie keep doing what she's doing without being taken down by the fusty old system? Will she do herself in? She counts on her girls' loyalty to serve as a shield, but how much can she control them?  Will she lose her prime? <br /> <br />Spark is a knock out writer, who precisely skewers her characters and the world in which they move.  She moves effortlessly between the present and future moments in their lives, revealing the cause and effect of this education.  This novel is wryly comic.  It is also psychologically astute. <br /> <br/>
B000683VI4|1.0|I watched this movie several times, trying to figure out what was so good about this movie. I discovered what was good about The Notebook was NOTHING. This movie did not make me think about love or anything. I found it very pathetic. Why everyone likes it, I'm not sure. However, there was a couple of things I liked about The Notebook... the previews and the credits (which confirmed it was finally over!). If you want to see a real love story go see The Titanic, go see Brokeback Mountain, even go see Superstar! But not The Notebook. You will be bored out of your mind! Guaranteed!
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Not classic Maiden but for 2006 I'm very impressed.  The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg is an excellent song that stands up to anything the band has ever done.<br /><br />Yeah, if you're new to the band I'd say start with some of their classic 80's discs but if you're a fan this is a great buy.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|I'm not going into the whole story here, just what makes the HD-DVD version special. Needless to say, the movie is great. <br /> <br />First, the picture quality. There is NEVER any blockiness that you sometimes see in fast-motion HDTV broadcasts. The colors are perfect. The blacks are pure black. When not in the dark, the colors are rich and full. <br /> <br />The movie features lossless Dolby TrueHD. Even if you have the XBox 360 HD-DVD drive, you'll notice an improvement in sound. The sound is clearer and has more definition. It is hard to describe, but the sound is just better. <br /> <br />This is one movie that is a must to your HD-DVD collection. It is great demonstration of the quality of HD-DVD.

B0009WFFS6|2.0|I was watching this on KCET and had to find a place to comment.  A few minutes after I  started watching it I noticed parts were out of sync.  Then I watched closer.  Everything was out of sync!  Clapton's playing a chord when you hear a ripping solo.  That bad. Lips are moving, but no words begin to come out for a few more seconds.  The music is awesome, but don't get this to watch Clapton rip it up.  It just doesn't work. <br /> <br />5 Stars for the music... Go and buy the CD instead.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I agree with most of you when I say that this long over due!!!! How can there be crappy series like Laguna Beach out on DVD, when one of the most influential high school drama series isn't. This show explored issues that are both deep and controversial. I didn't realize how amazing the show actually was until I watch all the episodes again. I was only a young girl when this show came out so I couldn't understand the story line. However, now that I am 23, I can see how they pushed the limits. Such as teenage sex, drugs, pregnancy, drinking, and the breast cancer scare. Also, the role of Donna being a virgin was encouraging for girls because it made virginity seem important...I think it balance all the sex that was going on.  <br /> <br />Now for the music issue...I was very young when this show came out so I can remember what kind of music they had, but I wouldn't care if I did. Lets see what they do about the Color Me Bad episode, can see if they use different music for that. Now that would be awful. But come on the beginnings of this show didn't revolve around music. Also, I think music became popular when the series involved the After Dark. That was when 90210 started bringing more famous bands on the show.  <br /> <br />The only thing that I am disappointed about is that there are no Special Features!!!! How many years did they have to plan for this release!!!?? They could have included some old casting tapes or something. <br /> <br />All in all, I will be purchasing all of the seasons no matter what. No matter what the music is like or the lack of special features, it cannot change the plots of the series which no other series today could compete with.  <br />
037582913X|5.0|More than two decades before the Internet made\\"interactive\\" a houehold word, Jon Stone's brilliant Sesame Street book, featuring furry, lovable Grover doing his best to convince the readers to not turn the pages (since there is a MONSTER at the end of the book!  How scary...!)  All the other positive reviews are correct: this is a brilliant children's book, every bit as fresh and inventive as the Sesame Street program itself.<br /><br />What's best about this version, as opposed to the board-book or pop-up editions, is the part on the title page, where Grover glances at the indices and mutters, \\"this is a very dull page...\\" and rushes us to the beginning.  Also included is the great gag where he makes us go back t the outside cover to confirm that it says there is a (yikes!) monster to the end of the book, each bit setting the tone for this wildly creative, comedic gem.
B000002KHB|3.0|Best hard rock album ever? Uh, NO. I'm sorry, but I fail to see what the big deal about this record is. Smoke on the Water's cool (obviously), and I like Highway Star, Lazy and Space Truckin' too. But this is a disposable album, I mean listen to songs like Maybe I'm a Leo, Never Before or Pictures of Home and you'll see what I mean. Ritchie Blackmore lacks the creativity, sheer virtuosity, and personality of Jimi Hendrix, but he's a passable guitarist, and he has a way with a riff (Smoke on the Water, for instance). The rest of the group's faceless, though, and the record offers no surprises. with the exception of the harmonica solo on Lazy. I'll admit that caught me off-guard. And the less that can be said about the lyrics, the better. But if you're willing to look past all those flaws (and trust me, there are lots), you'll find it's a fun headbanging indulgence meant for occasional spins.<br /><br />Recommended listening for hard rock fans (I hate the term metal - it calls to mind those awful hair-metal, death-metal and nu-metal bands)<br /><br />Back in Black (AC/DC)<br /><br />Appetite for Destruction (Guns 'n' Roses)<br /><br />Paranoid (Black Sabbath)<br /><br />Houses of the Holy (Led Zeppelin)<br /><br />Are You Experienced? (Jimi Hendrix)<br /><br />Disraeli Gears (Cream)<br /><br />All are miles ahead of this.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|When I first heard this cd I thought \\"its ok\\".  The second listen I thought \\"very pleasant\\" The third listen , it grabbed me.  Very beautiful.  To those who were disappointed-stick it in the stereo-turn it up loud-pour yourself a glass of wine and let it take you away. Definitely worth buying.
B000J103PC|5.0|When I first heard that the Devil wears Prada was being made into a movie the thought came to my mind \\"Why god why....my favorite books always gets made into movies\\" Cos few of my other favorites books like 'About a Boy' was almost you can say a summary of the book. But I was in for a shock when i saw 'Devil wears Prada'. With her silver hair and pale skin, her whispery diction as perfect as her posture, Meryl Streep's Miranda motivates both terror and a measure of admiration. No longer simply the incarnation of evil, she is now a vision of aristocratic, purposeful and surprisingly human grace. Anne Hathway was like fresh breeze of Air...    Its a must watch for everyone who has been ever tortured by his or hers boss.
0793518326|4.0|A great collection but they tried to cram too much into a small area making some of the tab and notes (esp. in the bass) very difficult to read. It would be perfect if it were the standard 12\\" height with spiral binding.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|I love this CD.  It is lucky, however that they included the \\"bonus track\\" of \\"Somewhere.\\"  Otherwise, the entire CD would have been well under 41 minutes.  Again, this doesn't even get me through my lunch!   <br /> <br />The songs soar, the voices meld and rejoice.  But 41 minutes, please, please, please.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I LOVE the joy luck club.  It's one of those films that everyone can relate to.  The divorcee, the overachiever, the immigrant child (myself), the disfunctional family, the difficult life experiences that changed you, the difficult relationships and sacrifices one had to make, the mother/daughter conflicts, the rivalries.  It's truly wonderful to watch because it's so real.<br /><br />Often in films we see a fantasised version of things, everything has a fairy tale ending.  In this film there are no fairy tale endings where everything falls into place nicely.  This film is not like that.  At the end, luckily, things improve for everyone when the family does become closer.<br /><br />I would say that it's a film everyone should have in their dvd collection.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina is undoubtedly one of the absolute best (if not the best) vocalists to come along in recent years.  She's never failed to awe audiences with her incredible range and provocative wardrobe.  She's cosistently been outspoken and confident, regardless of her style.   <br /> <br />Love her or hate her, one thing is for certain: this album is spectacular.  The introduction, \\"Intro (Back To Basics)\\", reels the listener in as the beat winds up and a classic male voice announces the entertainer of the evening, that being the lovely X-tina... er... Baby Jane, as she is now referred to. <br /> <br />Right off the bat, Christina's new image fits her beautifully.  She pulls off that glamorous ruby lips and big blonde curls look with flying colors.   <br /> <br />On to the music.  All the music on this two-disc set is tinged with classic horn arrangements, sexy and bold lyrics, and the occasional gospel choir.  Altogether, there are 22 tracks, though several of them are shortened for a more dramatic effect.  Initially, I was entirely in love with the second disc, which is a little more ballad-heavy and includes my favorite song from the album, \\"Candyman\\".  The track is a throwback to ladies groups of the 20's and 30's, with tight three-part harmonies and of course many of Christina's trademark melodic runs and vocal flips thrown in.  But after repeated listens, the first disc, which is a little more modern and contemporary with its hip-hop beats, is winning me over.   <br /> <br />\\"Understand\\", the fifth track of disc one, is a personal favorite of mine.  Christina successfully merges class, sensitivity, old-fashioned vocals and beats that make you want to doll yourself up like Marilyn Monroe.  Another standout is \\"Without You\\", which is probably the best vocal track of the entire album.  Christina performs so well on this track, my jaw dropped many times as I listened.  \\"Still Dirrty\\" reaffirms Christina's fans that she'll always have a little bit of X-tina in her, butshe reminds with class and not trash.  \\"Thank You (Dedication To Fans...)\\" is impressively produced, with voicemail recordings of fans wishes and thanks, cleverly set to the beat of the song.  However, this track seems a tad self-indulgent, and while it's enjoyable, a little goes a long way.  But that is the only questionable moment on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" is another highlight, done big-band style with sexiness to spare.  Christina continues to have fun seducing the listener with her sensual analogies.  \\"I Got Trouble\\" is a fantastic number recorded with a classic microphone, giving Christina's voice a scratchy quality reminiscent of old records.  \\"Save Me From Myself\\" is the quietest of all the tunes, but one of the most moving and sensitive.  It's nice to hear a softer side of Christina.   <br /> <br />The album art is beautiful and playful, and contains many shots of Christina in various settings, often with intense makeup while posing in dramatic positions.   <br /> <br />I would love to see our new Baby Jane continue to make music like this.  But this is Christina, and she'll surely venture down another avenue in the future.  In the meantime, get this musical candy while you can from a young lady who finally knows herself and has embraced her sweetness (while still holding onto that inner 'dirrt').
B00078XGRO|5.0|This was a great movie, with the next generation only finally. They obviously took this movie seriously and what more can I say. Alice Krige was deliciously evil as the Borg Queen. You couldn't help but feel drawn to her in a fatal, demented way. You almost felt sorry to see her \\"die\\" in the plasama coolant in the engine room in the end. Jonathan Frakes did a terrific job along with Zimmerman at bringing out the horror of the Borg. They were truly frightening. It still gives me shivers! Just the perfect villian ever on Star Trek!
B00005JOQS|1.0|Superman has a rich history. From the Silver Age comics and George Reeves TV shows, to Christopher Reeve films and the more recent Lois & Clark TV series, there's a high caliber of talent, story lines, and photography to strive for. Unfortunately, Superman Returns contains none of these.<br /><br />Here is the simple plot, other than the ending which out of courtesy I won't spoil for you. Superman left earth for 5 years to visit what was left of his destroyed planet Krypton, and has now suddenly returned. Lois is mad at him, barely remembers Clark Kent, and has a boyfriend and a son. Lex Luthor, who was broken out of prison, has stolen a crystal from Superman's fortress (whose whereabouts he knew from a 1980s Chris Reeve film). The crystal can build massive dark towers rising from the sea, which will ultimately threaten the entire planet, including Metropolis, with earthquakes and total destruction. Lex's goal is to build himself a new island with these land masses, and of course kill Superman.<br /><br />Viewers are asked to accept that Superman didn't say goodbye to Lois first before leaving earth. Superman would never not say goodbye to Lois, given their relationship; but the writers needed this to happen so she would be angry at him and find a new lover, which is intrinsic to the plot. We are asked to accept that Superman is still in love with Lois. Yet his actions don't support this. We are asked to accept that Lois hardly remembers Clark Kent, Superman's other identity. But this completely ignores 60+ years of the Superman mythos. The writer appears to have used Superman as a vehicle to advance his own story, which essentially has nothing to do with Superman.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is miscast as Lois Lane. Often wimpy, she lacks the fire and verve that made this character a great reporter. Bosworth is much better suited to the role of mother. Brandon Routh is adequate, given the few lines he has to work with; there are even moments when he shines. A sensitive chap, he nicely imitates Chris Reeve's Clark Kent. But he doesn't exhibit enough mental and emotional strength we have come to expect from Superman; and his physique and looks simply aren't Superman material. The best acting job is from Kevin Spacey, who plays Lex Luthor. Parker Posey, who does a great job as Luthor's girl friend, would have made a good Lois.<br /><br />The camera moves much too quickly at times, making one dizzy. The sets are dark and dismal and uninviting. The considerable footage of noisy destruction is s-o-o-o boring. Some heavy editing, to whittle down the mayhem by a good 30 minutes, would have served the film greatly.<br /><br />The ending is unrealistic and untrue to who the characters were supposed to be. Despite the use of Jor-El's voice from a previous Chris Reeve movie, there was little continuity in the Superman story line. The one excellent feature is the well done, realistic flying scenes. You feel as though you're right there in the sky with Superman.<br /><br />This was a most disappointing experience. Even for a Superman fan like myself, there was little to redeem this film.ates Chris Reeve's Clark Kent.

B000083C49|5.0|This is probably my favorite of the original movies. The story may seem ludicrous in some ways, but it  has all the right character elements. It is just plain fun! Defintely get this one for your collection. Leonard Nimoy did a good job directing and bringing out the best of the cast. I highly reccomend it to anyone.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters, Inc. (Collector's Edition)~ Jack Angel is an astounding animated movie that deals with monsters scaring little children to gain energy for their city. The script is well written and the storyline is amazing. John Goodman and Billy Cristal are doing a bang up job in the movie, and I really love the message of acceptance and tolerance. The music is also perfect for the movie and the animation is some of the best I have ever seen. The movie is filled with many classic scenes like the initial scare scene with the high scores and the scene with the kid and the little monster children. This is a movie that I highly recommend and I give it five stars!
B0000683DH|5.0|Nick Meyer did a great job at his first directorial debut for the Star Trek franchise. I liked the much more navy~ish feel and the more military style with clear cut ranks and the like. That is one reason I think that has attracted people to this movie. The effects used in the movie were good for the budget and ILM did good for what little money they were given (I think they were were also working on Jedi at the time as well, which has more budget for effects). Definetly get this for your collection.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This mix on high resolution 5.1 is breathtaking  brilliant production I was taken a back with the production its magnificent and worth every dollar, I grew up with the Beatles I have never heard them as well as the DVD Audio.  George Martin and all the people who put this one together should take a bow, I have several DVD audio  High Resolution this has to be one of the best mixes I have had the pleasure to listen to  <br /> Simply superb !!
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|Good movie for the Next Generation cast and crew. It has good special features on disc two (especially about creating the baku villiage). It has the most on location shooting of any trek film probably. It also has great effects that Star Trek is know for (although in this film they didn't use ILM, they used two other effects companies). This movie is more lighthearted, although I think the bad guy is shallow and boring personally. Not deliciously evil like Alice Krige as the Borg Queen in the previous installment.
B00026KDC2|5.0|I couldn't praise this album enough.  If you're a fan of The Black Crowes, pick this one up.  The style is similar to that and spike's voice has a resemblance to that of Rod Stewart somewhat. <br /> <br />My favorites from this album are 7 O' Clock (obviously), Man On The Loose, Hey You, Long Time Comin', and There She Goes Again.  The entire album is brilliant...sleazy, bluesy rock n roll.  You can't go wrong with this one.  Fits just about every mood.
B000JJRIO8|3.0|In November 2006, Interscope Records and Mother of the late rapper released a new 2Pac album titled \\"Pac's Life.\\" The album features the likes of many, including T.I., Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Ashanti, The Outlawz, Bone Thugs and Swizz Beats. The album is not 2Pac's greatest album, but keep in mind they are running out of material to use. Stand out tracks include \\"Untouchable Swizz Beats Remix\\" feat. Bone Thugs, \\"Pac's Life\\" feat. T.I. & Ashanti, \\"Soon As I Get Home,\\" and \\"Dumpin\\". The worst track on the album is \\"Play Ya Cardz Right (Female Version) with Keysha Cole. Cole sounds out of place and sings too much on the song, almost making it Cole feat. 2Pac. Despite some negative reviews saying the beats are wack, the beats are fitting for 2Pac in my opinion for the most part. Some are a little off, but they are just trying to have 2Pac fit in 06. Keep in mind, the tracks he left were unfinished and a little outdated for our times. If this is the last 2Pac record to be released, I have to say I am dissapointed. Hopefully we will get one more record produced by Dr. Dre and some other top knotch producers. However, Pac's Life is worth listening to atleast once. It's Pac. He's a legend, you gotta respect him regardless of what people are doing to his songs. Good or bad. Give it a listen. Oh yeah, I gotta buddy Aaron Franchise who I gotta shout out on here cuz he is like the biggest 2Pac fan of all time. Peace.
B00011D1OA|5.0|I'm not generally a fan a musicals, and I vaguely remember being taken to see \\"My Fair Lady\\" when I as a child. I suspect I may even have caught it on TV sometime or other over the years. My prejudice here was \\"it's not my cup of tea.\\" That was then. I purchased this DVD as gift for my mother. At first I didn't intend to watch it with her, but I was hooked.<br /><br />The quality of the audio and video transfer and reproduction here is superb. I suspect home video technology, improved television screens, DVD digital quality and improved sound, is what makes a real difference when viewing these classic masterpieces one more time.<br /><br />A great trip down memory lane. For both me... and my mum!
0618680004|2.0|What a disappointment.  For [...] Dawkins gives weak, sometimes extremely convoluted scientific explanations and logically flawed philosophical arguments against religious positions while other less expensive books such as \\"What is Atheism\\" by Douglas Kreuger give considerably (and sometimes irrefutably) stronger arguments and hard core evidence against the same religious positions.  Dawkins writing style is comparable, ironically, to the writing style of most of the authors he competes against such as Lee Strobel. That is you have to sift through a lot of fluffly warm fuzzy personal stories and anecdotes to get down to some logical thinking or evidence.       My sincere hope is that anyone \\"on the fence\\" who is starting to examine Atheism doesn't start their journey with this book.   I much rather recommend starting with Kreuger's book.  It covers much of the same material but with much more in-your-face logic and facts in a less expensive and less wordy package.
0743298020|4.0|At the beginning of Diane Setterfield's debut novel, THE THIRTEENTH TALE, our narrator, Margaret Lea, gets a letter from Vida Winter, one of the greatest writers of the century by most accounts.  Margaret prefers the constancy and reliability of Victorian novels to contemporary fiction, so she's never read any of Miss Winter's books.  She is, however, aware of the enigmatic author's reputation in the press.  First, there's the mystery of the \\"thirteenth tale,\\" the story that doesn't exist; and second, there's the fact that Miss Winter has given hundreds of accounts of her life to various reporters over the years -- all of them fabrications.  Now it seems Vida Winter has commissioned Margaret, rare book collector's daughter and amateur biographer of obscure historical figures, to write about the truth of her life.  And although Margaret is at first wary of the author's honesty, it isn't long before she's swept up in Miss Winters' haunting, disturbing tale. Miss Winters tells of the Angelfield family of Yorkshire:  incestuous siblings Isabelle and Charlie, twin girls called Adeline and Emmeline. She tells of a governess and a topiary garden, a ghost and a fire.  It's a truth stranger than fiction, and we readers are instantly captivated right along with Margaret. <br /> <br />I first learned about THE THIRTEENTH TALE when I saw it on the New York Times Bestsellers List -- at number one, no less.  In a world where serial characters and churned-out novels by prolific romance writers reign, there is little room on the charts for a literary work like THE THIRTEENTH TALE -- so when I saw it in the top spot, I knew I had to get my hands on it. <br /> <br />And I wasn't disappointed.  THE THIRTEENTH TALE is a rare find. It's the kind of novel that completely beguiles you, transports you, makes the rest of the world recede.  The atmosphere is lush and spooky, the prose is seductive and mesmerizing. Setterfield excels at creating tension in both Margaret's and Miss Winter's stories, and she utilizes the \\"story within a story\\" technique brilliantly in the novel.  Setterfield channels the great Gothic novels in her execution, earning THE THIRTEENTH TALE a place on the shelf right beside the best of Austen and Brontë. The tone of the novel is very Victorian, very old-fashioned, very...British.  I was completely riveted by the language, totally entranced by the story.   <br /> <br />There were a few things, however, that made THE THIRTEENTH TALE less than a five-star read for me.  Although I think Setterfield did a good job of developing her female leads (and what a difficult job it must have been to develop and balance two first-person protagonists), I do think the dynamic between Margaret and Miss Winter could have been further explored.  I also found it frustrating that readers aren't given a frame of time in which to place Margaret's story.  We're given to believe that her narrative is taking place in current day; however, she corresponds only in letters and transcribes all of her conversations with Miss Winter using pencil and paper.  This rings untrue if the story is, in fact, set in current day (but I suppose it also further contributes to the Gothic quality of the novel, and maybe that was the intention).  And lastly, the mysterious \\"thirteenth tale\\" for which the novel is named was a little bit of a let-down when its content was revealed. <br /> <br />But I think this book is worthy of all the praise it's garnered since its release.  It's like nothing you've ever read before, and nothing you'll read after.  At one point early in the novel, Margaret observes, \\"There is something about words.  In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner.  Wind themselves around your limbs, like spider silk, and when you are so enthralled you cannot move, they pierce your skin, enter your blood, numb your thoughts.  Inside you they work their magic.\\"  That's exactly what THE THIRTEENTH TALE DOES:  It captures you from the first page, and it doesn't release you until after its satisfying conclusion.  And maybe not even then. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  THE THIRTEENTH TALE will make you remember why you love reading.  Don't miss it!
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I did not give Richard Donner's Superman II 5 stars because I'm a fanboy. Because I am not a fanboy (or so I'd like to believe). I gave it 5 stars because first, it is far better than Lester's SII, and second, because the studio and the filmmakers obviously poured their heart into the effort and it is all there on the screen. <br /> <br />I agree with many of the postings here on Amazon about the positives of the film. The villains come across more menacing, having Marlon Brando back is incredible (truly, when you think about it), and the camp is toned down dramatically. And now I FINALLY understand why the green crystal was sooo important! <br /> <br />There's no question that in some areas it looks like a film waiting for final re-shoots, final effects, even a final sound mix. It's surely missing a couple of scenes that would fill in some plot holes. But I knew that going in and it did not detract from the experience. And many of the new scenes are tight, polished and improve the film dramatically. Within the first few minutes I felt Donner's SII was already better than Lester's. <br /> <br /> Being a movie buff, I frequently watch some of my favorite films from long ago to see how they hold up upon adult viewing. I rediscovered Superman: The Movie when I was in my twenties or so. I enjoyed it immensely (as I still do from time to time), not for the nostalgia, but for how entertaning it tells the story. I could not say the same for Lester's Superman II of which I could not sit through entirely. My kid loved it, as I did when I was a kid myself, but I simply didn't enjoy it as much. And I remember not being able to put my finger on it at the time. Discovering the saga behind the making of Superman II, I started to understand why Lester's cut felt so different, and not nearly as good as the original. <br /> <br />Now I feel where Superman: The Movie is a classic film in the overall history of cinema, Richard Donner's SII is, FINALLY, a classic 'comic book' movie that entertains with sparks of brillance that remind you of the first movie and how 'super' it was. <br /> <br />I am very grateful for the release of Richard Donner's Superman II. As childish as it sounds, I walked to work this morning with a bounce in my step humming the various themes of the film. And it's because watching the Donner cut has left me feeling like a kid again, enjoying the adventures of the late, great Christopher Reeve as Superman. Not to mention how awesome to the eyes Margot Kidder was as Lois Lane. And the new ending with the dialogue between Lois and Clark gives the film a subtle and gentle greatness that is fitting and makes it one for the ages. <br /> <br />I'm happy to finally own Superman II on dvd and I look forward to viewing it again sometime in the near future.
B00003BDXG|4.0|I have seen this movie many times. Some people love it, some people hate it but regardless of what you think, this movie makes a statement. I myself like it and think it was one of the best movies of the 90's. It's about a young couple Micky and Mallory who basically go on a killing spree. The movie flashes back to their lives, telling stories of their abusive and violent childhoods. It's a very dark love story about two people who are so messed up from horrible parenting and American culture and so desensitized that they have no value for human life. It is filmed in a very unique, edgy style which was ground breaking for it's time. This movie IS NOT for children and not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of gore and foul language and the 'body count' is extremely high! Some people think it glorifies violence but I would have to disagree. I think it's an honest movie and more a parody of how OUR MEDIA glorifies violence and makes celebrities out of people who are criminals!
B00005LQ04|5.0|Who cares about a really rich fleshed out story and plot when the film is just this drop dead gorgeous and gruesome.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the story in 'Suspiria'.  After all, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.  But let's face it, Dario's films are always more about a sadistic, visceral attraction than they are about story.  But that aside this is truly one of the most beautiful things ever put to film in my opinion.  The colors are stunning thanks to the use of the original Technicolor process and the shots are gorgeous and well composed.  Argento really had a great eye back then.  I am anxiously awaiting the 'The Third Mother' with his daughter, Asia as well as the return of Daria Nicolodi.  From what I hear it sounds like a very promising cap to this trilogy.
1845761502|5.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I have known both the subject of this book, and the author of this book, for many years.  Having admitted to that, and at the risk of being labeled a shill, this is one terrific volume, cram-packed with photos and conceptual art, and an abundance of text that far surpasses standard coffee-table-book fare.    Stan Winston is one of the top artists working in the field of motion picture makeup and creature effects, and from his studio have emerged iconic characters for the Aliens, Terminator, Predator and Jurassic Park series, as well as countless others.  Creatively allied with powerhouse filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and Tim Burton, Winston has had the talent and resources to perfect his craft and advance the state of the art.  Though much of the Stan Winston story is recounted in his own words, Winston shares the limelight with members of his crew, past and present, whose own recollections and reflections, often humorous, enliven the text.  At its core, the book is a lovefest; but Winston and his chronicler do not flinch at giving weight to his personal and professional failures, as well as his successes.    Author Jody Duncan is no stranger to the material.  As editor of Cinefex magazine for 15 years, and one of its principal writers, she has a commanding grasp of the subject matter.  She has also authored \\"making of\\" books for several Stan Winston films.  But this book is no rehash.  All of the interviews and perspectives are fresh and illuminating.    I own just about every book on makeup and visual effects published in the last 30 years -- several shelves' worth.  If I had to pare them down to five essential volumes, \\"The Winston Effect\\" would be among them.    Don Shay, author of [[ASIN:0615213456 Endangered Liaisons]]
1559409010|5.0|Monty Python's Life of Brian is an absolutely hilarious comedy.  Anyone who is a fan of comedys, or even of movies themselves, should own this one.  It is definately the best of the Python's four films, and is very well put together compared to the others.  Criterion has put together an excellent DVD for the film which contains some very interesting special features, including two great audio commentaries featuring the Pythons themselves.  The DVD does not contain region coding so it should operate on any DVD player in the world.  Please note however, that the DVD does not have English subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired, despite them being listed as one of the special features.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|A young girl begins sleepwalking and saying the words \\"silent hill\\" before she awakens. The girl was adopted and originally lived in West Virginia. The mother does some research and finds out there is a town called Silent Hill in West Virginia and decides to take her daughter there to find a reason for the girl's problems. Silent Hill, it turns out is a dead town, consumed by an underground mine fire, and is fenced off from civilization. The mother is pulled over by a motorcycle cop who thinks she looks suspicious. The mother thinks the cop is suspicious herself and takes off. She blows through the fence and into Silent Hill, eventually crashing to a stop. When she comes to, her daughter is gone and she searches the ominous town for her. She eventually meets up with the cop again who also crashed her motorcycle and they find that Silent Hill is a very strange and haunted place. They are attacked by creatures made of fire and ash, they watch another creature kill a woman and end up in a church with a cult that follows the whims of one paranoid, deranged woman. The mother eventually faces the creature in the darkness and learns the secrets of the town and her adopted daughter.    Silent Hill is a bad movie, mainly because it has no soul. The story, while odd, is not all together original and the movie depends too heavily on effects. Some of the effects are very cool, but meaningless as far as advancing the story. Also the story does not entirely make sense. Things happen that are never explained and the ending was confusing. The movie is too long for this type of film and the middle section gets pretty boring. A good actor, Sean Bean, is wasted with virtually nothing to do as the girl's father. I wasn't surprised to find out that this was adapted from a video game because with all the effects taking center stage you never get a real connection to the story.
B000JJRIO8|5.0|Afeni and all those involved in Amaru Records did an excellent job by Pac's Life. This album, production wise, is exponentially greater than Loyal to the Game. Sha Money XL, Swizz beats, LT Hutton, a classic cut from QD3, Salih Williams from Carnival Beats, and a couple of upcoming producers made this album customed to Tupac's lyrics. The lyrical content is by far greater than many of live MC's that's out today. Play ya Cardz Right( male and female version), Untouchable, Pac's Life, Dumpin, Don't Stop, Sleep, basically all 13 tracks. The guest appearances are great too. Fatal Hussein shined on this posthumous release, Papoose(the next legend), Carl Thomas, Keyshia Cole, Snoop Dogg, T.I., A3 and Jay Rock, Ludacris, Keon Bryce, Ashanti, Gravy, Outlawz, Young Buck, Lil Scrappy, and Chamillionaire, all did a great contribution to the LP. I have been a fan of Tupac's since 2pacalypse Now( favorite track Part-Time Mutha), to now. Like Pac said he will leave a legacy, and people will remember him. Fake Pac fans who hate on his music in the present were really never fans to begin with. Loyalty is not to no man but to God, but to be real to one another, we all deserve that being dead or alive... <br /> <br />Good job Afeni
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I love this CD so much that I am sending it as an early Christmas gift to friends and family.  Yes, it is a bit melancholy--but that's the way this season sometimes is.  I especially like the mix of secular and religious songs.  My favorites are River, The First Noel/Mary Mary, and In the Bleak Midwinter (which is one of my favorites from the Episcopal Hymnal.)
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|I am a huge Incubus fan i've been following them since S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and have seen them live twice. I never write reviews for albums, but I felt I was obligated to express my dissapointment with this album. It is really a weak effort following a promising album A Crow Left of the Murder. DJ Kilmore is nowhere to be found in this album, I realize he is in it but he has no major impact. This album is very overproduced and is Incubus' most pop oriented album to date, with that said the album is so weak that you will not here many of the songs from it on the radio period even with the pop sound. Anna Molly is a decent 1st single but not near as good as good a first single as Megalomaniac, and I can't find any other songs that could be strong second singles. Mike does not have many shining moments on the guitar which is the complete opposite from A Crow Left. Even Brandon does not stand out and take over songs with his amazing vocals as he normally does. I thought Incubus was on it's way to a new and very cool future on their last album withour Dirk Bass, but I now realize how important his amzing Basswork and funky riffs were to the band. He was an essential part and their albums without him have not been stronger than any of the big 3 with him. I have not been this dissapointed in an album since Dave Matthews last work Stand up (which i still prefer over this). The only reason I give this 3 stars is because it's Incubus and I support them and know they can rebound (as long as they don't produce this pop stuff). Decent tracks of the album include Dig, Anna Molly, Light Grenades, and Paper Shoes. The way I would rank Incubus' big albums thus faer are as follows <br />1. Morning View (by far the best, amazing jams all the way through) <br />2. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. (close call b/w this and MY, but this album is the berth of brilliance) <br />3. Make Yourself (like the first 2 is listenable all the way through) <br />4. Crow Left of the Murder (great album and different sound, Mike's guitar work really stands out on this disk) <br />5. Light Grenades (not even in the same atmosphere as any of the others)
B000CFLFX4|1.0|This SO CALLED SWEEPER IS **%100 JUNK**.. I purchased two with the idea that one I would keep and another I would give as a gift.. The one I kept worked for 1 to 2 minutes AFTER a complete recommended charge (6-8 hours).. Tried recharging, worked for less than 30 seconds... When the second one arrived, I knew I wasn't giving it away so I figured I would try it.. Worse, different charger and different battery - as soon as I would set it on the tile floor, immediately it shuts-off.. I feel there should be a class-action suit over such a product that was MEANT to rip off the public... All I can say for those who are lucky enough to read this before ever purchasing one,  DON'T GIVE IT AS A GIFT AND BY ALL MEANS REALIZE THERE ARE UNBELIEVABLE NUMBER OF SUCKERS LIKE MYSELF WHO BOUGHT THE HYPE ONLY TO BE LEFT FEELING SCREWED !!!
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Well, Incubus has returned with some fresh material.  Yes, it's different than the previous five albums but what would a band be if they're music didn't evolve. I personally think this new offering is better than \\"A Crow Left of the Murder\\", but I do agree that the album falls a bit on the short side. I was done listening to it in about 45min. That's only a half-mile trip down the street in L.A. traffic. Trust me, that's how far I went while listening to the album.  They experiment a lot and produce some intersting results.   <br />      <br />The first track, 'Quicksand', was a slow start for album. It almost feels like the next track, 'A kiss to send us off' might have been a better opener. 'Dig' definitely has the potential to be the next single, followed by 'Anna Molly', the first single from the album. 'Love Hurts', is a slower paced ballad which may make it to the radio waves, but I personally had to skip through half of it. The title track, 'Light Grenades' takes it back to the days of \\"Fungus Among Us\\" and \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\" Very fast paced, with a punk vibe to it. The next and last track which I'll call the 'Earth to Bella Twins' were a waste of track space. Could've done without 'em. 'Oil and Water' is one of my personal favorites on the album, with subtle guitars to start with along with Jose's tribal-like drumming which progresses into a hard/mellow hybrid. 'Diamonds and Coal' is probably the most poppy song they offer but a good track nonetheless.  Just feels a little weird hearing this song on a Incubus album.  'Rogues' is a nice funky tune, with sharp guitars and pounding beats; also one of my favorites. The next track, 'Paper Shoes' sounds good and the off-beat drum line compliments it very well. The last real track, 'Pendulous Threads'is a perfect finish to an overall, funky/poppy/grungy/etc. album. <br />      <br />     Overall, if I had to compare this to one of their previous albums, I wouldn't be able to.  It's got a little bit of everything.  Maybe that's the reason it won't appeal to as many fans as say Morning View, which I consider to be their \\"Pop Breakthrough\\". Incubus has definitely improved in the last three years, personally and musically. Now, they just need to work on leaving out the junk and making their albums a little lengthier.  Therefore, I recommend this album for the true music lover and not so much for the mainstream Incubus fans. For those of you mainstreamers, I recommend you go online and download single tracks off this album.. Legally of course. ::Wink::
B000J10ERO|1.0|Did superman really needed to be resurrected in this way?  <br /> <br />Like many of my generation that grew up with Christopher Reeve and Superman, I could not wait to see the new superman. I was personally crushed when Chris died and thought this could be a movie that could revitalize the story.  <br /> <br />How wrong was I.  The superman without any of the high tech special effects and where the chemistry was noticed immediately is the superman I remember. Bad acting, bad script, and bad chemistry make this the worst Super movie ever. The wholes in the plot remind me of old Swiss cheese. I would rather watch the last one Chris was in, while it was not the best, it was better then this one. <br /> <br />The only similarities between Chris and Brandon are the looks and that's where it stops. Brandon really should have stuck to soap operas where mediocre acting is accepted and the produces should have chosen the likes of Dean Cain or Tom Welling from Smallville.  Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had excellent chemistry. Too much attention was used on special effects and not enough attention was paid on the actual actors.  <br /> <br />Clark Kent really needs to talk and superman was never few in words, so why is he this way in this movie?  <br /> <br />Singer should have stuck with XMEN, which I personally like. If Christopher Reeve knew how bad this movie was he would be rolling over in his grave in disgust. I am certainly glad he did not live to see the mockery they made out of Superman.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|I agree with some of the other reviewers in that you can't really compare the previous albums with eachother because they each have a slightly different sound. BUT I do not think this is Incubus' best work...at all. First of all the album itself is incredibly short with only 13 songs. As soon as I heard the first song I recognized Boyd's voice was different; more trained if you will. I don't think that any of the other guys' talents shine through and the lyrics are rather cliche, as the title \\"Love Hurts\\" blatantly exemplifies. I do really love \\"Oil and Water\\" and \\"Dig\\" for their different sounds, but the \\"Earth to Bella\\" 1 and 2 are completely not needed. I mean I understand the whole point of releasing new music is to show growth, but I think its debatable whether Incubus has  grown beyond recognition.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|Many of you may not have known that the reason for the long wait between Loreena McKennitt's albums is because her fiance died a very tragic death and she wasn't going to make a new album at the time due to the loss of her beloved.  She has apparently changed her mind since then.  I am sorry to see that some of you are disappointed in her latest album.  After the tragidy of her loved one, I can understand why she made a sadder, more sorrowful sounding album.  I like her music no matter what, but before you bash and criticize her newest album too much, please remember that she DIDN'T have to make a new album at all.  Keep in mind that the sorrow behind the music may be a way for the artist to express the tragidy behind her loss as well. Also, too much change can sometimes be a bad thing as well.
0307346609|5.0|Max Rrooks started this project as part of the United Nation's Postwar Commission Report.  The intention was to explain how the undead plague came so close to exterminating the entire human race, but Brooks was also interested in preserving the experiences and memories of survivors who played an important role in the more than a decade of open warfare it took to defeat the enemy.  Of course, most of us have vivid memories of the plague years--have seen loved ones cut down and then reanimated into the flesh eating ghouls that nearly reduced civilisation to rubble.  Although no more than pure motorized instinct, the creatures had massive numbers and an insatiable appetite.  In \\"World War Z,\\" Brooks presents, in both large brushstrokes and intimate personal histories, how the disease was first detected, how it spread, and finally how we learned to combat it.<br /><br />Brooks traveled the globe and interviewed people who would play a major role in the war, and thus the book is a compendium of their recollections.  Beginning with Kwang Jingshu, the Chinese doctor who diagnosed what is today believed to be patient zero, then moving on to Tibet, Greece, Brazil and of course the USA, we track the path of the zombie pathogen.  In the United States of Southern Africa (known prewar simply as South Africa) we get an overview of the controversial Redeker Plan from a surprising source.  There's also a lengthy and exiting interview with Colonel Christina Eliopolis (unfortunately one of the few women included here), whose exploits as a downed Air National Guard pilot in occupied Louisiana have become legendary.  Elswhere, the disturbing story of the debacle at Yonkers, New York gives us a grunt's eye view of that infamous battle.  Of course, the war changed the entire world, and we re-learn how Russia became the Holy Russian Empire and the horrendous nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan.<br /><br />Considering the subject matter, \\"World War Z\\" is relatively brisk at just 342 pages, but almost no detail is left uncovered.  Brooks did an admirable job with his research, and thanks to his backing from the U.N.,he gained remarkable access.  While, as I noted before, there are too few female voices here, this is a wide-ranging account of what will undoubtedly remain one of the darkest chapters in human history.t 342 pages, but almost no detail is left uncovered.

B000HIVQD0|5.0|Chrissie Hynde and the Pretenders have probably done more to popularize punk rock than almost any other band, save the Clash (and maybe even then, too). If you doubt this statement, then you need to listen to their debut album once again, which has been re-released in a deluxe edition, with a second disk of bonus tracks. Their first album combines ferocious energy, attitude, and raw talent with elements that are rare for most punk rock; intelligence, and a heightened sense of melody. Hynde defines herself here as the penultimate tomboy femme fatale, mostly because of her sense of self-control and viciously sharp observation. The toughness of her demeanor is stunning, but it only works because you can sense the vulnerability of her stance. \\"Precious\\" is the ultimate statement of self confidence bolstered with an aggressive attitude, but it is balanced by the wary sensitivity and sympathetic nature conveyed in \\"Kid.\\" This dichotomy is a major factor when conveying the timeless appeal of this disk, but the band's ability to keep the energy level at full force is equally important.<br /><br />Guitarist James Honeyman-Scott provides a textbook-perfect example of brilliant support, ripping through riffs without wasting a single note. Bassist Pete Farndon jettisoned the momentum of drummer Martin Chambers, working the rhythm section like a pair of Olympic skiers perfectly tearing their way through an obstacle course of dropped beats and odd time signatures, yet somehow making it easy to bang your head in time. Honeyman-Scott and Farndon were not long for this world, but this album is a testament to what they were capable of. \\"Tattooed Love Boys\\" is a miracle of shifting beats, hard drive and pure attitude. \\"Mystery Achievement\\" is a marvel in rhythmic momentum, providing the bed of nails for Hynde's tough vocal stance. \\"Brass in Pocket\\" may well be the most brilliantly conceived single of the punk era, adding a deft touch of pop sensibility which helped catapult the band past the commercial limitations of pure punk. The bonus disk has a few highlights as well, including the masterful \\"Cuban Slide,\\" and a great, raw demo versions of \\"Brass in Pocket\\" and \\"Stop Your Sobbing.\\" \\"The Pretenders\\" is a near perfect record of its times.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|I have been a Loreena fan for 10 years.  I love the album, especially the more Celtic tunes (Themes from the middle ages, set in England, Scotland and Ireland).  Some people have written that this is more of the same.  Of course!  If you have most of her music, and have seen her on stage, you will understand that there been some long standing themes to her life and music.  One of them is 'The Old Ways', and another is the migration and influences of the ancient Celts.  The latter explains the integration of eastern instruments and sounds.  Loreena's music has always been easily identfied by her unique sound.  The Old Ways is about a way of life, developed over hundreds of years, that many feel is closer to ideal than the current modern way.  There is much more to this, and I encourage anyone interested to look into this themselves by reading Loreena's writings on her albums and at quinlanroad.com.  She is also a fan of Dante, Shakespeare, and the book \\"How the Irish saved Civilization\\".
1401307450|3.0|I like his band but to be honest after reading this I don't particuarly like Keidis as a person, which is surprising because my perception of him before reading this was that he seemed like a nice guy. He really comes off as a backstabbing, thieving, hustler, druggie scumbag. It gets a bit monotomous towards the end but its worth reading if your a Chili Peppers fan.
0679746048|2.0|While I found her stories to be interesting enough, the book is not in a chronological order which made it a little hard for me to follow the stories of each individual girl that was talked about.  I read this book for my sociology class and would not have read it if not for the class.  The hardest thing I found was that early on in one part she talked about a girl that was in the hospital for trying to commit suicide and eventually succeeded, yet later on the dead girl is in one of the other stories.  I had to take notes to keep track of everybody and their ilness and treatments and personalities.

I am truly disgusted.<br /><br />People are making a killing off words and songs that he never spoke or sang.  They are literally piecing individual, unrelated words together to make verses.  For shame.  They'll get their comeupins, though...<br /><br />Please do not put money in the pockets of these death pirates.  If you want good Makaveli, bootleg it.

0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary theorist and holds the Charles Simonyi Chair in the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University. He is also a best seller author of science books, and quite easy to read.<br /><br />In this book, Dawkins tackles the problem of religion -- and he does see it as a problem. Dawkins begins by pointing out that there is no evidence whatsoever of god. True, he cannot prove that god does not exist, but the same is true of all possible gods, including Zeus and Wotan. The fact that something cannot be proven false is no evidence whatsoever that is true.<br /><br />Dawkins further points out how religion (or, more precisely, faith) is so damaging. Faith is, quite simply, the enemy of reason. If one believes something on faith then, be definition, it does not matter what the evidence shows, one will still believe. It is a matter of faith. No matter how strong the evidence of evolution, for example, many faithful simply refuse to believe. With faith, there is no argument, no evidence good enough. With reason, one will still make mistakes, but at least one is trying to get it right.<br /><br />Dawkins believes very strongly in what he says, but that does not make him just another fundamentalist. Dawkins came to his beliefs by looking at evidence, considering all arguments and applying reason. If, tomorrow, one presented him with evidence that he was wrong, he would change his mind.<br /><br />This book will offend many readers, but that is not what Dawkins intends and it only proves his point: readers who are offended have been so blinded by religion that they are unable to consider that they might be wrong without suffering pain.<br /><br />For an explanation of how evolution works, read Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker. For a small sample of the evidence behind the theory (and a brief history of life on earth), read The Ancestor's Tale. These books are written in a less strident manner, and would only offend the those who take the Bible completely literally, and cannot tolerate the thought that they are mistaken.take the Bible completely literally, and cannot tolerate the thought that they are mistaken. <br />
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Eugene Hutz' question to Grandfather was my favorite line in the movie.  While living in Romania I visited a cemetary in Iasi, a city near the Ukranian border.  There is a huge cemented over mass grave there that holds the remains of thousands of Romanian Jews that were massacred by their fellow Romanian citizens in 1940.   It is difficult to get present day Romanians to confront their past treatment of Jews.  \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" blames the massacre portrayed in the film on the Germans.  I have Ukranian friends who did not like \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" because I suspect it forced them to confront an uncomfortable reality with their past (like the Romanians), even though the object of the search in the film, Augustine, is a Ukranian gentile who saved Elijah Wood's Jewish grandfather from the massacre by the Germans.  After living in Romania for 6 months, the movie brought back memories of just how beautiful the countryside is in that part of the world.  Watching them travel around in the ubiquitous East German Trabant station wagon, which is a collectors item nowadays, was icing on the cake for a funny and enjoyable film.  Eugene Hutz is the most likable movie character that I have seen in a long long time.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|If you came in expecting Fallen, you were either happily or sorely mistaken.  In this album, Amy Lee and company have shown a much greater emotional and musical range, and this is much better than the merely above-mediocre outing in Fallen.  Also, it seems that this album is missing some of the artistic conflict of the last album.  I'm glad they've finally chosen whether they want to be a hard alternative rock band or a Christian alternative band.  I really don't know what to say other than that which has been said better by others, but for my money, this should win Album of the Year.
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|Throughout the 90's and the new millennia, Incubus was one of the driving forces in Alt.-Rock, vastly expanding genres from album to album, yet always staying true to their progressive funk roots. Light Grenades is no exception to this pattern, the only problem is that Incubus' newfound musical direction has taken a turn for the worse, and in one fatal swoop, utterly disassociated themselves from the pseudo-progressive rock movement.  <br />        For a vintage incubus fan, this album is a heartbreaker. There is a catastrophic swing from great Funk-Rock to cookie-cutter pop with flashes of blind punk thrash. What seems to be bogging down this album is the absence old bassist Dirk Lance, the founder of and rhythmic leader of the band who is no longer with them, for reasons never really explained. If he left because he felt the band was taking a turn for the worse, this album proves him right. The only thing is, A Crow Left of the Murder was an exceptional album that garnered very high ratings without Lance's presence. Either way, something is wrong. <br />         So what this presents fans is an option to either roll with the changes undertaken on Light Grenades, or forget this cd was ever released and keep listening to the oldies but the goodies. The first thing that came to my mind was visions of another debacle in music, American Idiot by Green Day, which sports a grenade on the album cover, as does Light Grenades. Is there a correlation between the two? Hopefully not, because all Green Day is creating is unintelligent Bush-bashing (which I am all for) slop that I wouldn't call music. There is no way Incubus could fall to that, or is there? <br />             Light Grenades opens with an echoic track entitled Quicksand, in which Boyd's vocals resonate over light bass and electric fills, creating a crescendo effect that never really climaxes, and leads right into A Kiss to Send us off, which is one of the cd's highlights. What A Kiss does is present the changes embarked on LG with the fusion of their past sounds, which still isn't exactly amazing, just tolerable.  <br />Incubus shows off their newfound interest in cookie-cutter pop rock in the songs Dig, Anna Molly, Love Hurts, Oil and Water, and Diamonds and Coal. The overall theme for these songs is one of radio friendly, slow paced songs that have painfully annoying 3 minute progressions which have no substance and ride the line of being cheesy. With any cd, there is room for 1 or 2 sub-par \\"fillers,\\" but when 5/13 of your songs are skippers, there have to be questions raised about the validity of their art that's being put on shelves. <br />        LG never really shows that the band had control over much of the creation of the cd, it sounds very overproduced and polished beyond belief. It shows, because there are only a handful of good songs on LG. Those being Quicksand, A Kiss to Send us off, Earth to Bella (part I-II,) Rogues, Paper Shoes, and Pendulous Threads. Even with a selection of good tracks, the bad ones destroy LG, because they rob it of any cohesiveness and concept that should be involved with the creation of any cd, because after all, music is much more than entertainment. <br /> The standout track is easily Paper Shoes, which opens with a Phish-esque acoustic guitar and drums, even infusing Boyd's hand drum expertise in the bridge to the second verse; something that isn't done enough anymore. Even though Paper Shoes has every audible sign of being a jam oriented tune, it never really progresses into the actual jam that they are oh-so-capable of doing.  <br /> With that said, its easy to put this album on the shelf and write it off as the end of yet another stellar band, but because this is Incubus, there may be hope in Light Grenades. That hope is that this is a cd that grows on you, and eventually becomes something worth appreciating, because after the god-awful first impression this album puts out, and the unimaginative grenade artwork, it seemsas if this album would be better off left on the shelves of its retailers. <br /> <br />Light Grenades  -  2.75/5 stars

B000063UUY|5.0|This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon.

B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I reviewed all their albums recently and the more I listen, the easier it is to understand how much more mature Incubus has become over the years.  While a Crow was loose and abstract, Light Grenades is tight and focused.  You can  tell that the band has become serious when you compare it directly to Morning View.  And serious music is what stands the test of time as far as Rock and Roll goes.  I put this album right on park with A Crow as their best.  Because I think they understand their individual roles now, nobody really overshadows one another.  This album marks another strong stepping stone removing them from teeny boppers, and granting them musical credibility among their peers and predecessors.
B00001OH7N|5.0|I am deeply embedded in classic rock, and a significant portion of what falls into this classification is dated, or lame initially. This one never fails to amaze me! It is one of those lesser known masterpieces, Nirvana never topped this, in fact they borrowed a tune from this LP. 2nd best--Diamond Dogs. This man will go down in history as a Maestro, if not f**k them, I know what I'm talking about!
1878424319|2.0|Before I unleash my review, let me say this: the content of the book is quite good.  There are stretches of up to two pages where I was enthralled at every paragraph.  This guy has something to say... <br /> <br />...but it's a book best borrowed from the library.  The material contained between \\"The Four Agreements'\\" covers could easily have fit into a 40 page volume, as opposed to the 138-page one the author ended up publishing.  Why, why, why?  It's SO frustrating (just as Ruiz' \\"Voice of Knowledge\\" was) to hear the same bad examples rehashed every few pages...the same simplistic sentence structure, the same over-the-top arguments, the same talking-down-to-the-reader, the same oversimplification of other (complex!) valid philosophical viewpoints.  Annoying, to say the least...I've never hated reading an author so much, who I'm sure I would absolutely love if I met him in person. <br /> <br />Look, if you need detailed expansion, connection, validation (using silly assumptions and incorrect definitions of opposing arguments), endless repetition, and a general dumbing-down of EVERY point in the book...then you'll have no complaints.  The material IS all good.  It's just repeated to the point of driving me to insanity. <br /> <br />This is the most emotionally charged review I've ever written.  I think the material is great, but it's presented in a way where it takes all my self-control not to throw the book across the room and move on to the next title on my reading list.  ANNOYING. <br /> <br />Get it from the library, to make sure you really want to spend your money on it.  Oh, and the whole Toltec thing is played up to a near-comical extreme.  Anyone who takes the time to do 15 minutes of online research after the book will realize that the author took some BIG liberties with his presentation of Toltec history and culture.  Let's face it, none of us were there, and it was a LOOOOONG time ago.  Make your point and let it rest. <br /> <br />*sigh*
0743289412|5.0|This book I will admit, was very slow to get started for me.  It just hung there.  Could be me, could be the mood I was in, I don't know.  But, WHAT a good book once it began to flow.  This is one of those books that stays with one after the final page is copleted.  It is a love story, yes with a bit of suspense involved.  But it is more than the story of love between a man and a woman, it's the story of the love of words.  There were a few passages that brought me to tears but the overall atmosphere is what remains with me.  The atmosphere of the forest with the sign pointing the way 'to the pool'.   <br /> <br />Mr. King your favorite english teacher must be so very proud of you.  I envy you having had that type of influence in your life, and I'm also grateful you DID have that ... we are all reaping the benefits of him. <br /> <br />Eagerly awaiting your next book.  Let me go with Dicken's here:  Please sir, may I have some more?
0618680004|5.0|This book makes for an easy and fascinating read.  Richard Dawkins is both an eminent evolution biologist and an excellent writer.  Just like Carl Sagan did, he can educate us about complex subject.  He tackles the hypothesis of whether God exist as a scientist and comes up with a predictable outcome (the null hypothesis).  He dissects that hypothesis in 10 very readable chapters that cover different angles on the subject, including: history, morality, logic, science, and education among others.  Contrary to Stephen Jay Gould and the Pope John Paul II, he does not think religion and science belong to separate domains.  As a Cartesian, either facts are consistent, verifiable, coherent, and cogent or they are not.  Science explains the way the universe is.  Religion perpetrates myths.  On page 97, he states: \\"The only difference between `The Da Vinci Code' and the gospels is that the gospels are ancient fiction while `The Da Vinci Code' is modern fiction.\\"<br /><br />Dawkins is very precise even when dealing with the domain of beliefs.  As a scientist, he excels at classifying and disaggregating concepts.  Thus, he differentiates between believers and nonbelievers along a spectrum of theist, deist, pantheist, and atheist.  He explains the difference between each in detail.  And, then he compresses their meaning in probabilistic terms.  A theist believes there is a 100% chance God exists, an agnostic (close to a pantheist) believes there is a 50% chance he does.  And, an atheist believes there is a 0%.  Dawkins ability to explain concepts in different ways (logical and quantitative) is a powerful pedagogic tool.<br /><br />He also does an excellent job of fleshing out the different roles religion plays including 1) explanation, 2) exhortation, 3) consolation, and 4) inspiration.  And, why religion is now obsolete on all counts.  Science has taken care of (1) given that science contradicts everything in the scriptures and that science provides a better explanatory platform to understand our universe.  Moral guidance outside religion has taken care of (2).  He supports this argument with both Darwinism and Game Theory.  It is better for our survival and welfare to cooperate with others.  He also states that modern morality does not come from the Bible or any scriptures as those are loaded with unfeasible violent dogmas.  And, he argues that religion was never that good at (3) and (4).  Studies have observed that in nursing homes, it is the more religious elderly who are the most scared of death.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Dawkins underlines how religious the U.S. are.  He refers to several interesting polls.  When people are asked if they would vote for a Presidential candidate who is a woman: 95% respond affirmatively, but only 79% would vote for a homosexual and only 49% for an atheist.  In other words, our society appears more than twice as intolerant of atheists as gays.  Only 7% of American scientists elected at the National Academy of Sciences believe in a personal God vs 90% for the American public.  He notes this wide gap between top American scientists and the public.  He explains it by referring to studies including a Mensa meta analysis that indicate religiosity is inversely correlated with education, interest in science, and IQ.<br /><br />The book is full of thought provoking quotes either his or from others.  He states that \\"one of the truly bad effects of religion is that it teaches us that it is a virtue to be satisfied with not understanding.\\"  From Luis Bunuel, the Spanish filmmaker: \\"God and Country are an unbeatable team; they break all records for oppressions and bloodshed.\\"  From Seneca the Younger: \\"Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful.\\"<br /><br />He quotes Sam Harris, the author of \\"The End of Faith\\" extensively throughout the book.  This is even though their books are very different.  Sam Harris approaches the subject as a political scientist; Dawkins approaches it as a logician.  Harris explores the geopolitical risks of a religious World combined with 21st century arm technology.  Meanwhile, Dawkins dismantles the irrational themes embedded within the scriptures with 21st century knowledge.<br /><br />This book reveals many fascinating facts.  Tony Blair is apparently a lot more religious than the American media conveys.  He has supported the government funding of a series of schools that actively teach creationism within their science curriculum.  He has personally written to Tony Blair to amend this disintegration in science education.  Blair's office responded they support a diversity of views.  Dawkins stated this is diversity gone mad.  Elsewhere, Dawkins mentions the Danish cartoons of Mohammed scandal.  He reveals the sad fact that the 3 most scathing cartoons had been fabricated by the Muslims who disseminated copies of these cartoons throughout the Middle East to instigate violent reaction against the West.<br /><br />If you enjoy this book, I also strongly recommend Sam Harris' books \\"The End of Faith\\" and \\"Letter to a Christian Nation.\\"  As mentioned, Harris and Dawkins have different perspectives on the subject that can only expand the reader's own understanding.s a political scientist; Dawkins approaches it as a logician.

B000JJRIO8|5.0|FINALLY!!!!! they have done justice in memory of Tupac. This album is complete. I think Pac would be proud himself. The list of featured artist are superb. I was hoping to hear some tracks produced by Dr. Dre but maybe on the next album. Afeni make it happen. Go out and buy this album you won't be disappointed.
B000J3EEBY|2.0|I was very disappointed with this disc. After nearly ten years without recording new music, McKennitt does not give the listener much to go on. I felt most of the songs sounded tired and mournful. She surely hasn't updated her sound much. Many of the songs had long, dull introductions to them. I kept wondering when McKennitt might sing something. Her voice is still in fine form. Hopefully the next time around there will be a shorter wait with some new ideas for her music.
0446528056|5.0|Reviewed by Robin Gix for Reader Views (11/06)<br /><br />I have had the privilege of reading Nicholas Sparks' new book, \\"Dear John.\\" And that's exactly what it was; a privilege. \\"Dear John\\" is by far one of the best books I have ever read. The characters are so well developed in this story that one feels as though they know them personally. \\"Dear John\\" is a bittersweet look at love and how it stands up to the test of time. I honestly could not put this book down, and I recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />After a rebellious childhood, John Tyree enlists in the Army, not knowing what else to do with his life. On leave, in his hometown of Wilmington, North Carolina, John meets the girl of his dreams; Savannah Lynn Curtis.<br /><br />Savannah is attending college in North Carolina and working for Habitat for Humanity when she and John meet for the first time at the beach. Standing on the pier, Savannah accidentally drops her bag into the ocean, and John jumps in to retrieve it. Immediately there is an attraction between the two of them, and what seems to be a familiarity with each other.<br /><br />From that day on, Savannah and John spend nearly every day together during John's leave, and quickly fall in love. Savannah promises to wait for John while he finishes his tour of duty, when both intend to marry.<br /><br />In \\"Dear John,\\" neither Savannah, nor John, was prepared for 9/11 and what it would mean to their relationship.  After 9/11, John struggles with the decision of whether to re-enlist, or go home to Savannah. Ultimately, John decides to re-enlist in the Army, to help his fellow soldiers. \\"It would be easy to say that I was influenced by what was going on around me and that was the reason I made the decision I did. But that's just an excuse. Granted, I was caught up in the same patriotic wave, but more than that, I was bound by the twin ties of friendship and responsibility. I knew my men, I cared about my men, and the thought of abandoning them at a time like this struck me as impossibly cowardly. We'd been through too much for me to even contemplate leaving the service in those waning days of 2001.\\" Upon hearing John's decision, Savannah is at first supportive and promises to continue to wait for John, but can she really wait that long?<br /><br />Received book free of charge.y.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is the one Christmas movie that I watch every single year. If you like muppets, buy this movie. <br /> <br />To clarify, the DVD release contains two versions of the movie. The wide screen version is the original theatrical version in which the song between Scrooge and his fiance does not appear. This was not cut out for the DVD--the the original version of the movie that was released to the theatre simply did not contain the song. <br /> <br />The song does appear in the full screen version which is the original-released-to-video version for which they reinserted the song. <br /> <br />The above information is from the Brian Henson commentary included on the disc. Mr. Henson quite liked the song and that is why it reappeared when it was released on video. <br /> <br />Myself, I'm thrilled to have the original no-love-song version since I always fast forwarded through it before. However, it appears that Disney simply put both versions of the movie as they are on the disc without cutting or adding.  <br /> <br />As Gonzo says, \\"If you liked this, read the book!\\"
B00000K3CM|4.0|This is the inevitable sequel to one of the funniest films ever made. <br />Everybody returns,and they're as funny as ever.Brenda Fricker steals the film,and her scenes with the appealing Macaulay Culkin are the best thing in it.The work by John Hughes,Chris Columbus,and their colleagues is once again top-notch.But there are problems.For one thing,it's fifteen minutes too long.The story is a virtual repeat of the original ,only with the location changed,so it's not as fresh and too familiar.Some of the gags are also repeated with just slight alterations,so the movie is not as amusing.Still,this is an enjoyable family film worth watching.
B00005JPBJ|4.0|Saw 3, was by far the best out of the other saws, this one played with your mind as did all the others. This one was not really as jumpy or scary as the other two but by far was the bloodiest and graphic. There were many parts where it was almost nauseating to watch what was happening to the people. The \\"games\\" or \\"test\\" that jigsaw gave the people in the movie were a lot more intense and mind boggling than Saw 1 or Saw 2. Many times during the movie you have your hands over your face just peeking through your fingers not wanting to watch all the blood everywhere. I highly recommend seeing this movie if you like scary, or movies that play with your mind.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|I was really looking forward to this release- having always heard how much better the Donner version was before he was fired and the movie was reshot by Lester. <br /> <br />If Donner had been allowed to properly film his vision of the film at the time- his verson might have been better... <br /> <br />However, this DVD is just self-induldgent hack job. They found whatever original footage they could - probably even cutting room floor material and replaced as much of Lesters work as possible-even when it doesn't work as well. <br /> <br />The poorly executed screen test version of the Niagra falls scene where Lois Lane discovers Clark is Superman is jarring to say the least and not nearly as well acted as the Lester version. The dialogue in this scene and most of the \\"new\\" Donner dialogue is just bad and too long. <br /> <br />There are some things about this \\"cut\\" that I liked. I think Donner did a better job at directing Reeves in several scenes. Reeves delivery of several lines under Lester were sometimes over the top and Donner seemed to hit a better tone. <br /> <br />A line that always seemed \\"off\\" to me in the theatrical release was toward the end when Superman uses Lex to trick the 3 Kryptonian vilians into losing their powers. Hackman says something like \\" I was with you all the time\\" and Reeves replies \\"Not this time Luthor!\\" The delivery of Reeves line in Lesters version makes no sense and is over the top but the Donner version fits the situation perfectly. This is just a small example... but it makes my point. <br /> <br />I agree with many of the points that have been made in other reviews... the ending where Superman turns back time (again)was the wrong choice. The Lester version where Lois jumps into the river vs. falling out the window was much better.. I could go on... <br /> <br />OK, now some positives: <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the sound effects on this DVD version much better. From the \\"super breath\\" sounds to the \\"eye beams\\" the sound effects were toned down and are much more realistic. Gone- the cartoonish effects found in the theatrical version. <br /> <br />The video quality of this DVD is also very good for such an old film. Some of the visual effects were re-done or at least enhanced and don't always work but at least they made the effort. <br /> <br />I watched the Superman Returns DVD just before this one... I'm still impressed how the FX of the original first 2 films still hold up. Of course, they're dated but they're still almost believable which says a lot of the FX team who did these films. <br /> <br />My comments on this DVD are really more about the cut vs. Donners work. I do believe Donner is the better Director and could have made a better movie if he had been allowed to finish it. I just don't think this DVD is really the version he would have done. The finished product is just an interesting curiousity (as another reviewer said) but not a better film and not worth spending your money on. <br /> <br />If I could do it again.. I would have purchased the DVD set that includes the Donner Cut and the Theatrical Release. I would watch the Theatrical release again. I don't think I can suffer through the Donner cut again...

0307346609|5.0|Yes, it's a zombie novel. But it's not your daddy's zombie novel. In the same way that good genre flicks can make great films, Brooks (whose daddy is Mel Brooks) reminds us that science fiction and horror writing can actually be literature. Presented as a series of individual interviews with survivors of mankind's global war against the undead, World War Z eschews cheesy jump-out-and-get-ya horror tactics for universally relevant, sometimes terrifying, and always human tales of survival in the face of terror (interviewees range from civilian \\"relocation camp\\" survivors to front-line grunts, from Aussie astronauts to the US Vice President). Add to that the fact that Brooks is an astute and sometimes scathing social critic with an amazing eye for detail, and I can comfortably say this is one of the best new novels I've read in a long, long time.

0671027387|1.0|Ugh.  I just suffered throught the 17.5 hour, unabridged audio book on a trip.  I think there are several problems most of which could have been solved by editing the book down by 1/2.<br /><br />A lot of the in-depth detail made me groan, \\"So what?  Do something!\\"  Example:  I didn't need every detail of the lingering death of a character's spouse years before.  The effect on the spouse could have been covered in a paragraph.<br /><br />More than once a character would mentally review several plot points.  I didn't need the review, I'd just heard them.  Sometimes this was followed by jumping to another character's viewpoint and having that character review the same points!<br /><br />Also, there were some very artificial reasons behind plot points.  Example: Why would you need to darken most of a cavernous room to light a small portion for TV cameras?  Because the plot required it to be dark.<br /><br />And the unreal technology!  I love science fiction, but if you're selling it as a current-day adventure you can't make stuff up like this just to make your plot advance.  Example:  gnat-sized flying nanobots with live audio/video transmission.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Loreena McKennitt is my favorite recording artist (my Prozac, my muse), and her long awaited album \\"An Ancient Muse\\" is everything I had hoped for and more. Loreena's music is my chocolate, my endorphin; she calms my pulse, brings serenity to my mind and at the same time stimulates my imagination ... her music comforts my soul.<br /><br />\\"An Ancient Muse\\" differs ever so slightly from previously produced albums. The most profound difference is the progression of Moroccan musical influences. Which are stronger in \\"An Ancient Muse\\" than in any of her prior works. Yet, there is something hauntingly familiar about each song ... each new melody is like an old friend's homecoming. The familiarity is enduring ... a Loreena McKennitt signature!<br /><br />On one of my favorite tracks \\"Beneath A Phrygian Sky,\\" Loreena's intonations rise and fall with mystical proportions giving no doubt to her ancient Celtic heritage. In \\"The English Ladye and the Knight\\" (a poem by Sir Walter Scott) Loreena does what she does best, weaves her musical enchantment within the words of ancient bards. Poets, long dead but willingly resurrected to dance once more at Loreena's request.<br /><br />\\"An Ancient Muse\\" is not a remix of old material, but a subtle continuation of her musical and spiritual journey. The familiarity of rhythm and rhyme, within each note played and sung, is the magic of her music.<br /><br />Loreena is not merely a singer of songs.

0792838068|4.0|Leaving Las Vegas was released in 1995, which was many moons ago.  I can recall seeing the 10:00pm showing with two of my friends.  We decided we wanted to go to the movies and out of the choices at the theater in question, we went to see Leaving Las Vegas.  I recall it being very cold outside that night, the weather that evening would later play a part in our souls.<br /><br />Once the movie was over, the three of us were speechless.  Some good adjectives to describe our mood after witnessing Leaving Las Vegas, morose, forlorn, detached and just plain sad.  The only thing to lift our spirits was a middle of the night visit to Denny's for some greasy food.<br /><br />Now I haven't seen this movie since 1995, until the other night.  I watched it with the approach that the movie might not seem quite as sullen as it did oh so many years ago.  However, the motion picture was still deep and dejecting.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, Leaving Las Vegas is wonderful piece of cinema.  A dark and depressing drama, that at times haunts the viewer, but nevertheless a remarkable movie.  As for the acting, well it is top notch.  This is the last great movie Nicolas Cage has made; except maybe Face Off, some of his recent roles are real laughing stocks, i.e. Next, Gone in Sixty Seconds and Ghost Rider.  Elizabeth Shue's acting was also very good, a big leap from Adventures in Babysitting, Cocktail and The Karate Kid.  I also enjoyed Julian \\"Warlock\\" Sands as the Latvian pimp, and why Richard Lewis was in this movie puzzles me as much as who's the inspiration for the Mona Lisa.<br /><br />Now this movie does have its flaws.  I find it interesting that Shue's character was ravishing, sophisticated, unpolluted, insightful and moral, for a prostitute.  (If you can show me a call girl with those traits, then every red cent I earn will go towards the institute that is prostitution, and Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman doesn't count.)  The events that transpire to Shue in the film, along with her relationship with Cage's character, and her reminiscing with the \\"unnamed\\" individual through out the film, screams Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  However, I have never seen an individual with PTSD be as pseudo-jovial as Shue's character is in this movie.  Therefore, if you are looking for restitution of the human condition, this might or might not be the movie for you.  Though if you want to see Nick Cage drinking his soul out and Liz Shue, a call girl with a heart. Then this absolutely is the movie for you.<br /><br />I did find an interesting conduit with this movie; it is the unofficial sequel to City of Angels. It might sound silly, but watch City of Angels and follow Nicolas Cage's character in that movie until the end credits.  Once City of Angels is over; it seems pretty easy for Cage's character to continue into Leaving Las Vegas.  Without giving too much information about either movie, Cage's characters can blend into one and other. The key to this trick is too look at the obvious dichotomy among characters when watching both movies. I guarantee you will get it.  So if you have nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon, watch City of Angels and then Leaving Las Vegas.  You might be disappointed, but not surprised.<br /><br />Here is another interesting tidbit; Elizabeth Shue's character in Leaving Las Vegas is Sara with an E. Therefore the name is Sera.  In The Karate Kid her name is Ally with an I.  Therefore the name is Ali.  Now is it just me or does that seem just a little too convenient?<br /><br />I digress to that cold night in 1995, when the mood of the chilly weather suited the deflated spirits of my friends and I, after we left the theater.  It almost appeared that the movie produced the cold and aloof temperature outside that night.  Who knows, maybe it really wasn't that frosty out, but our composure after watching this emotional roller coaster made it seem colder that it actually was.  Which is the feeling Leaving Las Vegas leftfor three young men that night.  It made us dismal and somber, with the only fix being greasy food.  Just as Nicolas Cage's character only fix towards his gloomy and tragic life was alcohol.<br /><br />Told you the temperature had a frame of reference.nd somber, with the only fix being greasy food.

B00006I53S|5.0|I have been into photography for a little less than a year now, and this is my first lens upgrade (I've been shooting with a 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 and a 70-300mm f/4-5.6, neither with an Image Stabilizer, both with a 58mm lens face).  I bought this lens as my Christmas present to myself this year and I just popped it on... WOW!  I just zoomed in to 135mm and took a shot at 1/15 second with no tripod and no special stance to brace my camera.  It came out crystal clear!

B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie is for anyone who cares about the future.  The FUTURE of Humanity and the Earth.  We have heard the cries for many years now to make changes.  Although it seems that in the United States we have an attuitude of plenty.  This movie has an ability to help people realize that the tap doesn't flow free.  Unfortunately we may hit a major dry spell if things don't change.  In the next fifty years we may see changes that would be uncomparable to any time in our history. These dramatic changes can be very sad to watch.  The emotion soon turns to anger and hopefully from that turns to positive action.<br /><br />The signs are obvious and continue to become more dramtic as every year passes.  The Earth has always fluctuated between ice ages and natural warm ups.  Except now we are seeing something on such an expansive and dramatic scale that we are hard pressed to find anything that has occurred comparitively in the history of this planet.  It may be to late to change.  I hope it's not.  I hope that everyone who sees this will try and make a commitment to help make this world a better place.  This message is not political.  I don't want people to make this an issue of politics.  I want this to be an issue of our future and the future of our children.
B000J10ERO|5.0|(from a more extensive feature, copyright 2006 Michael F. Hopkins)<br /><br />Filmmaker Bryan Singer continues to deliver the cinematic<br />goods with his exceptional work on SUPERMAN RETURNS. The<br />man who broke stunning dramatic ground with THE USUAL<br />SUSPECTS, and resurrected Marvel's overrated X-MEN<br />franchise with two sharp motion pictures which shed<br />the comic series' overripe melodrama, brings us the<br />heroic saga that audiences worldwide have been waiting<br />for since Richard Donner's 1st SUPERMAN film.<br />More than a follow-up to that 1978 extravaganza, SUPERMAN<br />RETURNS is an epic feature which showcases the quality of<br />theme and character which Donner and the much-beloved actor<br />Christopher Reeve were denied in their tireless efforts to<br />portray the Man of Tomorrow as a straightforward saga.<br /><br />Where the 1978 feature (and Reeve's live-action series, in<br />turn) was stymied by narrow-minded producers, the ham-handed<br />buffoonery of misapplied Broadway musical writers, along with<br />the genre snobbery and bastardized Gilbert & Sullivan stereotypes<br />encouraged by Lorenzo Semple's condescending BATMAN debacle of<br />the mid-1960s, Singer's 2006 feature strides the crest of a<br />legion of films depicting a more authentic approach to the<br />Sequential genre.<br />Singer's work on the X-MEN films, in fact, helped pioneer an<br />approach to such movies which emphasize the folkloric, the<br />literate, and compassionate in tales of heroism and wrongdoing;<br />shunning the aimless loopiness and pathetic campiness of an Adam<br />West...  or latter-day mindless throwbacks such as LOIS & CLARK.<br /><br />Singer takes a daring chance, however, in that he presents<br />SUPERMAN RETURNS as a follow-up  -and partial homage- to<br />the Donner picture. That's especially risky if nemesis Lex<br />Luthor is to be played as a cheap carny barker the way he<br />was portrayed by the woefully misused acting legend Gene<br />Hackman in the 1978 feature. Fortunately, Kevin Spacey<br />deftly dances out of that trap; the master actor tipping<br />his hat to Hackman's audacity, while bringing home the icy<br />menace of an uncaring manipulator who thinks nothing about<br />mass murder, or bringing down a champion of good from<br />behind.<br />Little about this Luthor to laugh about.<br /><br />In Brandon Routh, Singer makes quite a find. Many fanatical<br />types have decried the lead actor's lack of body mass, or<br />his visual and vocal similarity to Reeve. The key to portraying<br />SUPERMAN well, however, in in the balancing of subtlety to<br />bring home the derring-do, whoever plays the part. A quick<br />perusal of the animated SUPERMAN  of the 1990s will show a<br />deeper, more consistently effective drama than most other<br />onscreen depictions of the saga combined for this very<br />reason.

Characterization and<br />interplay form the tale.<br />Where Donner and Reeve take charge in the 1978 film, that's<br />what compels us to watch that film  -flaws and all- over and<br />over again.<br /><br />For Singer, Routh delivers a SUPERMAN of great conviction, conflicted<br />passions and, in the end, the most heroic sense of responsibility<br />that this age could portray. His every move, from striding through<br />a hail of bullets to humbly coming clean on abandoning Earth for 5<br />years, is the motion of a towering figure and a simple soul rolled<br />up in one dynamic person. With just the one film, his adept<br />emulations of the wide-eyed Reeve portrayal have already blossomed<br />into a depiction of tortured innocence and deepening concern which<br />is all his own.<br />That he could easily overpower an equally conflicted Lois Lane<br />(played beautifully by Kate Bosworth), but chooses not to, is a<br />superb depiction of the Siegel & Schuster creation's most shining<br />attributes.

B000F0UUT6|5.0|I recently purchased the 10th Anniversary Edition and I love it!  This version has always been my favourite since I saw it on the A & E Channel in 1995.
0452281881|5.0|This is type of light reading I really could not stop reading until I was finished. Not only was it great fun for anyone who has ever worked in a corporation (and I guess for anyone else too), it has had a red-thread story in it which went far beyond a collection of excellent jokes -- I was constantly curious who the story keeps developed.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie does a good job of explaining the truth of global warming and its impact on our planet's future and the future of species that inhabit it.    It is filled with power points, lectures by Gore, and stories of Gore's life, but I actually like the way these things were intertwined for several reasons:    1) the facts of global warming need to be simply portrayed and not overdramatized to reveal the truth of it to skeptics  2) scientific facts of rising CO2 levels and its potential impact were discovered decades ago, and Gore was one of the first to take it seriously  3) the similarities between the tobacco industry and its attempts to obscure the truth and the oil industry and its attempts to obscure the truth SIMPLY FOR PROFIT AND TO SUSTAIN ITS EMPIRE are profound  4) this issue must be politicized, because lobbyists are working hard to prevent environmental awareness and delay addressing this problem.  Also, people are too busy or too unwilling to change their habits.  Someone must counteract that pressure and encourage change on a large scale.  Plus, no one would try to use something as unpopular as ceaselessly promoting environmental awareness as a presidential campaign strategy.  The movie shows that Gore puts the environment first, uses the government as a vehicle to preserve it, and dislikes politicians who dismiss it.   FYI- Just look at the difference in reporting on a recent case:     [...]                [...]  So, see the movie.  It is an eye opener.  Really-- stopping terrorism, decreasing poverty and crime, negotiating to end religious division -- every endeavor to live in peace in the future is pretty much in vain if the world is uninhabitable.
B00009MGGI|5.0|I actually think that lovers of this genre cannot say anything but that it is a BRILLIANT moovie. I have not read the book and can't judge to what extent the mooviemakers and bookmakers deserve their credit shares, but this just unbelievably good political drama. The plot, the actors, all other possible dimensions of the trilogy are excellent. I began watching it late and despite having to get up early next day I didn't finish till I got to see all of it.
B00005JL0U|5.0|I would buy this in a second flat.  This movie was the best thing since sliced bread to me as I grew up.  I have the old beat-up VHS copy, and a bootleg DVD from who-knows-where that won't play in my DVD player - I want a real genuine version PLEASE!  I'm begging.    Edited YEARS later (1-28-09):  I'm still waiting.  What is the hold-up? - Michael, please do something!  It's currently selling as bootleg on ebay for $59.99.  That goes to show how bad people want this.  Please!
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|By this point in their career I'm fairly certain that the main bulk of people buying Incubus CD's on the day they're released are all dedicated fans, who regardless of their real opinions of this disc....will listen to it regardless, because even bad Incubus isn't all that bad. <br /> <br />I don't know what to think of this CD yet.  I know it's disappointing, but I'm not sure why.  I think the disc is a strange mixture of some of their harder sounds from Science, and then some of their less intriguing sounds from Morning View.  I can say that some of the ballads on this CD are just ridiculously bad.  \\"Love Hurts\\" will never be heard coming out of my CD player again.  If it's possible, I think I dislike it more than the Nazareth version (which I realize is an entirely different song with the same title).  I'm not sure why they put 2 versions of \\"Earth to Bella\\" on here.  The first one isn't bad, but it's not a highlight of the CD, and if anything the 2nd part makes the part 1 worse.  \\"Dig\\" is probably an ill fated attempt to re-kindle some of the success they had with \\"Drive.\\"  It's an ok song, but I only say that because \\"Diamonds and Coal\\" is worthless pot hole on this disc.  \\"Diamonds and Coal\\" has absolutely no musical depth what-so-ever.  It's the same repetitive rhythm all the way through the song with gimmicky pointless lyrics, and it honestly could have been sung by a Kelly Clarkson, Avril Lavigne, Hillary Duff, or any other empty pop artist out there.   <br /> <br />Call it \\"growth,\\" \\"evolution\\" or whatever you want, but when a band goes from where Incubus has been to putting crappy pop songs that could easily be on American Idol as title tracks on their 4th LP....I'd say their growth isn't in the right direction considering the amount of depth and talent this band has. <br /> <br />But there are some bright spots to this CD.  \\"Anna Molly\\" is a nice middle of the road song, and a good first single for that reason.  But the real highlights IMO are \\"A Kiss tosend us off\\" which is one of the heavier driving songs Incubus has put out since Make Yourself.  \\"Light Grenades\\" is a bit chaotic, but it's similiar to the sounds from Science which keeps some of us die hard fans happy (especially after having to endure Love Hurts right before it).  \\"Oil and Water\\" may be one of my favorite tracks on the CD because it is a bit different from some of their other stuff, but it's got that same vibe that songs like \\"are you in?\\" and \\"Wish you were here\\" had.  But I think \\"Pendulous Threads\\" is my favorite song on the entire CD.  I think this song represents all the things I like about Incubus past, present, and a direction I wish they'd take in the future. <br /> <br />Overall this CD is such a mixed bag of sounds it's very hit and miss with me.  There are some potential all time favorites on this CD, but then again I already dispise \\"Diamonds and Coal\\" and \\"Love Hurts\\" so this disc is like shrapnal in my ears so far.  Perhaps that's the point.
B000GY729M|5.0|I love it, this is a good album I love Sam's Town, When you were young and Bones.
0767817478|5.0|Yeah we all know this isn't THE BIG G. He has personality, a soul. This thing is just a special effect run amuck. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? Why violate Godzilla? All they had to do was change a few scenes around and call this the remake of BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, which this movie is actually closer to than GODZILLA. So trash NYC! Let it end in Disney World atop the most current ride attraction...& have a worker dressed in a Mickey Mouse costume fire the radioactive isotope!!! Now it becomes another Tim Burton remake, but that may be good. <br />I saw this film when it hit the theaters and have it on vhs & dvd. I enjoyed it (and still do) a whole heck of alot. It's fast-paced & action-packed! It's exciting & funny! It's a good time for all & a very fine giant monster on the loose film...but it just ain't GODZILLA!!! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Losely based on Allison Deboise's life. The real Allison Deboise is an amazing person. When she walks into room she radiates like an angel. Just a very gifted, nice person.This is a great show. Hope it runs at least a few more years.
B000F2C87Q|4.0|A nod to the insight of two other reviewers:<br /><br />A) Ball and Biscuit is indeed far and away my favorite White Stripes song and I understand why the other reviewer makes that point in relation to the Black Keys.<br /><br />B) In linking this intense-blues-groover to the Rolling Stones in their heyday, I would specifically point to I Just Want To See His Face, the fragmentary gospel-blues-from-the-jungle groove near the end of Exile On Main Street.<br /><br />I have just started exploring the Black Keys lately on the recommendation of a friend and up to now, have very much liked but not fallen in love with this band. However, Chulahoma stopped me dead in my tracks and just knocked me out. This is such intense, grooving blues, elastic without being jammy, can't say enough about it. The vocals are mixed evenly with guitar and drums giving the effect of an album of near-insturmentals. This is a good thing.<br /><br />If you are coming at this record from a rock and roll fan perspective, it will naturally lead you to the deep-blues of Junior Kimbrough. Thank you Black Keys and Thank you Junior Kimbrough.
B0001XAS2G|4.0|I would have presumed that producer Alan Parsons was less intimately involved with this record than with its predecessor, \\"Year of the Cat\\".  His own project had released a record the year earlier and he was likely devoting most of his time to that.  Nevertheless, \\"Time Passages\\" sounds far more like an Alan Parsons record than his previous collaborations with Al Stewart do.<br /><br />That's not a complaint, just an observation.  Whereas \\"Year of the Cat\\" (abbreviated hereafter as YotC) is at heart a beautiful acoustic folk record that is merely enhanced by Parsons' production, \\"Time Passages\\" seems to have been transformed, resulting in a whole new sound.  The title track is the most similar to YotC, using many of the same elements that made the title track from YotC a huge hit such as a mellow piano - or in this case, keyboard - intro, culminating in a loud and passionate sax solo near the end.  But the heart of this album is progressive, spacey, trippy, synthesizer-powered, mellow rock.  Not only that, there is also some very slick electric guitar playing on this record (played by the same guy who did the amazing acoustic guitar part on YotC's \\"On the Border\\".)  There are even moments on the third track that sound ripped straight from a Pink Floyd album.<br /><br />I find that Al Stewart's voice fits in very well with all of this, strangely enough.  Apart from \\"Time Passages\\" title track, I don't think the songwriting is as good here as it was on YotC.  Still, the production value is amazing and the album has a great sound.  This remastered Rhino disc sounds great, this is a good buy.<br /><br />In addition to Al Stewart fans, I think the album would be enjoyed by many fans of Pink Floyd, fans of the Moody Blues albums of this period (Octave, Long Distance Voyager, etc.), and even some fans of contemporary downtempo groups Air and Zero 7.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Even with the limited resources available to Donner, this movie is so much better. The camp is gone, and it fits into the first movie and even the new \\"Returns\\" so much better. Superman Returns was obviously continued from this Superman 2 script, because the re-edit answers a lot of questions that didn't match up in the newest movie. Like how is his kid super powered, why was the Fortress of solitude a charred husk? It just becomes a better and more serious movie, like the first. If Only Richard Donner had the budget now or never left the film originally, man it could have been perfect. But I am way happy with this. The first was great, the second to me started the downfall into the Campy family movie feel. This fixes it.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris, the author, is obviously as familiar with 17th Century European History as the founding fathers of the United States.  He makes many important points:<br /><br />  o  To ignore centuries of scientific discovery is foolish (and, in my opinion, blasphemous).  P.S. The difference between a man and a woman lies in a single chromosome.<br /><br />  o  One cannot reason with a true believer<br /><br />  o  A believer can rationalize the most hideous acts<br /><br />  o  Contemporary Moslems can not be reasoned with.  Accomodation is impossible.<br /><br />  o One ought live in the here and now (or, in the Quaker view, we are charged with making this world in which we live a peaceable kingdom).<br /><br />  o Politicans can, have, and will misuse religion for their own purposes.  (One good example is the drug laws which are used to maintain price supports.)<br /><br />  o Basing domestic policy on religious values is self-destructive. In the case of the U.S. it is a violation of the wishes of the founding fathers.<br /><br />  o Tolerance of the intolerant is intolerable (Or to put this another way, one is not free to speak ill of the principle of free speech.)<br /><br />  The book is thoroughly researched and replete with quotes from the source material.  My favorite quote is \\"Any person who lies awake at night  worrying about the private pleasures of other consenting adults has more than just too much time on his hands.\\"
B0007VZ9DK|3.0|With De Niro and Pesci together again, I was expecting this movie to folow in the footsteps on Goodfellas as far as quality and storyline, but I was disappointed. The film is much too long simply because it just doesn't stay interesting all the way through. The dialogue is bad at times. Sharon Stone's character gets very annoying quickly. This film isnt bad, but definitely nowhere near Goodfellas or many other Scorsese films has done.
B000002GWN|5.0|Every epoch or so a holy spirit infuses the heart, mind and soul of a songwriter compelling him to, say, pick up a lyre and write music intensely personally, yet also universal; music so powerful it can change a person's life. <br />I don't know if Joni Mitchell changed my life the day I sat on my dorm-mate's ratty sofa and first listened to the just released \\"Miles of Aisles.'' But it sure changed the way I listened to music. <br />Recorded in 1974 before live audiences in the Los Angeles area, it's one of those rare concert albums that sounds even better than an artist's songs originally recorded in a studio. <br />Mitchell by then had moved beyond her New York cafe days, and backing her is a jazzy, brass-heavy band, The L.A. Express. Her innovative guitar and piano playing -- she uses a lot of open fifths and changes keys often -- gives the double album an Impressionist feel -- etheral, but also edgy with dissonance. <br />No song better illustrates that Ravel-like effect than the first one, \\"You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio,'' where Mitchell soars into a falsetto at the end in a duet of notes with a guitar. <br />But it's her lyrical songwriting -- dense with fresh, strangely evocative metaphors -- that makes this the best album ever recorded. <br />\\"Miles of Aisles'' taught me that well-written music can equal, and sometimes trump, literature's power for changing an audience's perspective about such basic emotions as love, love-lost and alienation that make us human. <br />This is Mitchell's take on the narcotic effect of romantic love -- so addictive even the most cynical of us can't escape its allure -- in \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard'': <br />\\"The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68, and he told me that all romantics meet the same fate someday -- cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe. You laugh, he said, you think you're immune. Go look at your eyes, they're full of moon ...'' <br />The retort: <br />\\"Richard, you haven't really changed, Isaid. It's just that you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head. You've got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are dreaming. Listen. They sing of love so sweet, love so sweet. When you gonna get yourself back on your feet? Don't you know that love can be so sweet.'' <br />She ends the song with this remarkable metaphor:  <br />\\"Dark cafes -- only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away. Only a phase, these dark cafe days.''   <br />Sadly, just as Mitchell sings in \\"It's Down to You,'' \\"Everything comes and goes, just like lovers and styles of clothes.'' <br />So it's been with Mitchell the songstress, a fate she hastened by abandoning her folk roots and meandering into experimental jazz, then political diatribes. <br />But for those of us who turn to music as a way of finding some meaning in the vagaries of life, \\"Miles of Aisles'' will never go out of style.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|**Spoiler Safe**    Thanks to people like us and finally with cooperation from Warner Brothers to make this a reality, we finally can see Superman II the way it was intended, in Donner's vision! Fans of the Superman market have been pushing this forever (it seems) to make it a reality mainly due to the help of the world wide web. Countless web sites pushing, pushing to get this movie out. The problem has always been problems with Warner Brothers, but the main issue was trying to find the footage that has been locked up for decades.     With extensive assistance from Warner Brothers and the hard working people to find and salvage every last bit of Donner's film, it's all been put together and finally completed for a whole new Superman II movie like you've never seen before.   People have to understand Donner filmed nearly 85% of Superman II and yet the final release was still credited to Richard Lester. One of the reasons for Donner's dismissal was that Donner clearly aruged with the producers that Superman II was becoming \\"more campy,\\" than he wanted and he wanted it to have the same realistic tone as the original Superman conveyed.      After Donner was removed from his job, \\"Richard Lester\\" finished the job and was credited as the Director (so wrongly). Be that as it may, we finally got redemption for Donner.     I finally watched it last night, and I clearly prefer Donner's cut over the theatrical release of Superman in 1979. It's amazing how it feels like a whole new movie. They even redid the opening credits, it was great to see Brando and \\"Directed By Richard Donner\\" fly onto the screen. Donner's cut is clearly the best version in my opinion. The music scores are all redone, mainly the same toned music from the original Superman and having it in 5.1 Dolby Digital is the icing on the cake! The funny bits from the theatrical release of II has basically been taken out of this Donner version although you will see some scenes from the theatrical version in-tact. Nooffense to \\"Richard Lester\\" but his quirks in II made it feel too much like a comedy in so many instances. And him reprising is directing duties in Superman III didn't help either.  Donner was right when he described as part II becoming too \\"campy\\" as most of his footage was removed after he got the boot. Donner's cut shows a better more realistic vision as the original Superman did so well.     During Donner's Superman II, there is a more involving focus on Superman and Lois Lane's relationship and Lane's constant chase to get Clark to admit he's Superman. And for the first time ever, you'll see Marlon Brando back into the mix. As you know, Brando is not seen at all in the theatrical release of Superman II, even though he did finish scenes for the film while Donner was filming. The reason Brando was not in the final release was because he filed suit over his percentage of the first film's profits, so his scenes \\"filmed all by Donner\\" were removed from the cut.  So it certainly was a big downer for many as Brando was basically eliminated from the story all together. So he basically wanted more money. Warner Bros said no, so he said, fine, take me off the film.  But never fear, we now have the footage of Brando back into the mix, the way Donner intended. People said that the newly found Brando scenes are overdone and that Brando himself did not look to be sincere. I think otherwise. I really enjoyed the new scenes with Brando involved in the storyline, it really made the movie for emotional for me.       Along with seeing Marlon Brando back as (Jor-El) You'll experience as much as half of the film containing never-seen material.  All new, all by Donner and never seen before by movie buffs. You'll experience a whopping 15+ minutes of restored footage of Marlon Brando scenes well as tons of new Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder scenes throughout the movie. Because Donner's cut was not finished since they fired him about 85% through, you'll witness one scene where it's basically a \\"screen test\\" for Kidder and Reeve, but the scene was so well done and so important to the storyline of their relationship, it had to be included in the movie. The screen test is out of place, and you'll notice Reeve's hair and glasses changing from one scene to the next during it, but it's a great scene no matter how you look at it! Many of the scenes with Gene Hackman are also new and you'll notice many of the funny liners are all but omitted to give the movie a darker tone. Because Donner did not get to finish the movie, you will have to sit through some Lester footage from the original. Additionally, some of the other scenes from Donner's footage was not completely finished (special-effect wise) so you will notice some newly-filmed shots with new enhancements with modern day computers. The biggest addition of them all is the alternate ending which is totally different from the original release which I will not give away to you.    The movie's picture is excellent and the for the first time ever, you can watch Superman in 5.1 Dolby Digital. The disc includes a little 15-20 minute \\"making of Donner's cut\\" and how it came be and about 7 deleted scenes from Donner's footage. All good stuff.    I think Christopher Reeve would have been proud to see this movie if he was still alive today. You'll get to see just more of him and what a wonderful serious actor he can be. Donner's cut will be a big seller, and for big reason, Donner is one of the best directors of all time and I only see fit that Warner Brothers finally gave us, and Donner what we wanted, the real Superman II, the way it was meant to be.
B00005JPCD|5.0|\\"Happy Feet\\" is a great PG rated jukebox animated musical comedy with a positive environmental message that we ignore at our own peril.<br /><br />That's what \\"Happy Feet\\" is.  The problem is that people are criticizing it for things it was never intended to be.  If you wouldn't take a 6 year old to a PG movie then don't take them to this one.<br /><br />Some of the music lyrics are suggestive (but how many can actually hear and understand the words?) and there are accurate depictions of animal behavior at times.  The scene in which killer whales attack the penguins is reality.  If you don't want your kids exposed to that don't show them this movie.<br /><br />As for the politics of this movie, recent studies have indicated that human over fishing and pollution will destroy most of the world's fish within 50 years.  Depicting this reality is hardly \\"propaganda.\\"  It's informing the public that we need to change our ways - and doing it in an entertaining way.  (Ignoring this problem is the real \\"propaganda.\\")<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie highly enough - as long as the viewer is age/maturity appropriate.  If your child is going to think that eating fish sticks is an act of immorality then this movie won't be for them.  If they can understand that society itself is harming the penguins then they're old enough to enjoy \\"Happy Feet.\\"<br /><br />As for the adults, the music in \\"Happy Feet\\" is jukebox pop/R&B.  If you're expecting a Disney style musical with original broadway style songs you'll be severely disappointed.<br /><br />The IMax version of \\"Happy Feet\\" is visually stunning.  View it in that format if you can.  The extra admission price is worth it.
6305922756|5.0|\\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" has to stand as one of the greatest parodies ever produced.  To me, there is nothing about this movie that misses, and it is one of those rare movies that actually caused me to fall of my seat because I was laughing so hard (during the Stonehenge scene).  Ostensibly a documentary, or a \\"rockumentary\\" as Rob Reiner's Marty DeBergi says, it is a portrayal of Spinal Tap's implosion and rebirth by quickly moving from one gag to another.  Anyone who loves and follows heavy metal music, especially the new wave of British heavy metal movement (Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, etc.), will appreciate how well Spinal Tap skewers the stereotypes.  Those gags come rapid-fire, from stage prop malfunctions to songs heavy on arcane mythological imagery to inter-band feuds.  The earlier heavy metal acts are also not spared, such as in Christopher Guest's absolutely hysterical send-up of a Jimmy Page guitar solo.  Throw in some oblique references to even the most venerable acts in music, such as the Beatles, and you have a movie that pulls off the rare feat of being incredibly silly, bitingly witty, critical of heavy metal music, and paying tribute to the genre all at the same time.  I've seen Spinal Tap's formula copied many times since, but never with the same effect or quality.  This truly is the archetype for mockumentary parodies. As with most DVD's, this is packed with lots of extras.  The commentary by the principles, who stay in character, is a treat, as are the song videos, fake commercials, trailers, etc.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|This triple album is literally a midnight buffet for music fans.  Simply stated these are three separate, different and equally simply brilliant albums, released together.  The only issue I am having is whether to listen straight through to cover it all, or fixating on songs I run across that I particularly like.  My only criticism is that I can't listen to Bawlers straight though without getting completely depressed... I can't figure why he released them all at once in one shot like this but I am not asking too many questions.
B00062IVKS|3.0|I went into this film expecting a lot, since it was voted the best movie of the 80s, not to mention that it had Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. But I can't say that was all that impressed with this film. First off, I couldn't find myself rooting for De Niro's character in the film. Maybe that was the point that the Scorsese was looking for, but I found myself not really caring for the Jake La Motta character. The character almost seemed like a schizophrenic at times, becoming angry, paranoid, and abusive for no apparent good reason. If this was the way the real Jake La Motta was, then I think he should've been in an insane aslyum. Also, I must say, that I think that Pesci has the better performance out of the two, in the film. But props to De Niro for gaining all that weight to play an out-of shape, aging boxer towards the end of the film. I seriously was shocked with De Niro's appearance. I also give credit to the filmmaking by Scorsesse. The choice to film in black and white was a good one. Their are some excellent shots during the boxing sequences, the one that stands out in my mind the most is the blood dripping off the rope of the ring. But to say that this movie is one of the best movies ever made is a huge overstatement. Really, its good, but not THAT great. I don't really understand what separates the \\"classic\\" films from just the \\"average\\" films. How do some many people connect to a film that I feel was maybe a bit better than average? Maybe you have to have an aquired taste to really appreciate movies like this one, maybe I need to watch it a few more time, or maybe I was just overexpecting too much, whatever the reason, at this time, I just don't see why this movie is so greatly praised.

B000J103X4|5.0|Whenever I listen to this album I immediately think of Dave Chappelle's skit when the white guy switched spouses and moved in with a black family.  This is exactly the type of music he would have listened to.  This cd has everything - revelations about how great the game is, 37 basketball references, slams on every major rapper out there (except Will Smith, you missed one there Game, shame on you!), proclimation of extreme drug use, hoe bashing, and club references.  Here's are just a few samples of the lyrical genius that is the Game displayed on this cd -  <br />\\"ain't nothing but a g thing, baby it's a g thang, bounce like you got hydrolics in your g string.\\" <br />\\"It ain't been this much drama since I first heard Eminem, in the club, poppin' X pills like M&M's,\\" <br />\\"I can't be fked...like a lesbian\\" <br />\\"Too much criss in the club not too get drunk, too many bitches in the world not too fk\\" <br /> <br />5/5, WAWAWEWA, very nice!
B000IJ79WU|5.0|If you haven't seen The Donner Cut of Superman II, then you haven't seen Superman II. <br /> <br />Watching this film made me realize something. It made me realize that WB completely and utterly screwed Richard Donner and the entire Superman franchise by hiring Richard Lester to reshoot an inferior, rewritten script that made Superman II (the theatrical version everyone has seen to date) seem hokey, corny, disjointed, and and subpar on every single ascernable level. <br /> <br />Granted, The Donner Cut makes some use of test screens, and some of the footage isn't up to par with today's technology, but not once did that matter at all while watching it. The footage, to me, isn't the main point of the film, IMO.  The story that was told was so good that it didn't matter where the flaws in film and technology were. I litterally got lost in the moments as they happened.  <br /> <br />Even if you're not a Superman fan, or if you sit on the fence of fandom, you can enjoy this film. The story is so superbly written and the direction of that story is so well executed that all else fails in front of it. Compared to the Lester cut, the story is back to where it should be. The film's story is a more serious message of hope and love; a love that a father has for his son, and a hope that humanity might be saved by the ultimate selfless act. <br /> <br />This re-shoot gave everything significant meaning, and helped make the other movies in the franchise make sense. Christopher Reeve shined. Marlon Brando shined. And even though Kevin Spacey is one million times the Lex Luthor that Gene Hackman was, even Hackman's preformance was more believable; true to the character and brilliantly preformed. <br /> <br />If this film had come out instead of the Lester version of Superman II (the theatrical version), I think it would have blown doors off of Star Wars. The film could have been *that* that good. <br /> <br />It also makes me wonder where else that team of Donner, Reeve, Kidder andHackman, could have taken that franchise after a sucessful run of Superman II. <br /> <br />I don't care who you have to maim, kill, or destroy - get your hands on a copy of this film and fast. You won't be dissapointed.  <br /> <br />I give this film the highest reccomendation on all of Earth and Planet Houston.
0743289412|4.0|I like King, and this is one of his better ones.  Not quite as good as The Stand or Hearts in Atlantis, but close.  When it boils right down to it, it's a love story, and one that has a smidge of Nicholas Sparks.  There was only one part I had some trouble with and that was believing the whole world of Boo ya Moon, an imaginary world that author Scott Landon often visits.  If you can buy into this supernatural world, the story is perfect.  Once I forced myself to care about it, I enjoyed it.  Even if you don't, the story of Scott and Lisey's marriage makes it all worth it.  By the time you finish with the book, you'll feel as if you know these two people, and you'll care very much about them.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|Mitsuko Uchida is a brilliant technician who pours her heart and soul into this reading of the Mozart concertos.  This is \\"Mozart-plus-Mitsuko.\\"  Her charismatic performance is what makes this set of concertos unique and in my mind superior to all others. There is a close contender, the interpretation by Rudolf Buchbinder. Uchida is more profound, but Buchbinder's energetic precision qualifies him as the first runner-up.<br /><br />But there is really no comparing the two.  Buchbinder has an entirely different approach and is an entirely different person.  One might classify Uchida's style as \\"romantic\\" and Buchbinder's as \\"classical.\\"  Uchida's evocative style comes from her inner warmth and passion. Her incredible virtuosity illuminates the depth of character of both Mozart and Mitsuko.<br /><br />Mitsuko Uchida achieves those rare moments in great art when the revelation of divinity from the composer's inspired genius is passed through the performer's hands to inspire the audience. It works a kind of miraculous therapy.<br /><br />The English Chamber Orchestra is brilliant under the baton of Jeffrey Tate.  The orchestra sounds more focused and articulate than in the Murray Perahia concertos (under his own direction).<br /><br />P.S.  Theologian Karl Barth said that when the Angels play for God, they play Bach.  But when they are relaxing by themselves, they play Mozart.  I recommend both the Uchida and the Buchbinder.  I think the Angels would prefer Mitsuko.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Why do so many people feel inclined to compare MC to Madonna. Apples and Oranges. Two very different styles and types of music. Both are amazing artists in their own right, but, I will say this, MADONNA CAN'T SING!!! Nails on a freaking chalk board!!! She is however a great performer. Mariah has a beautiful five octive voice and can carry a note like no other. Watch Madonna in concert, buy Mariah's music. This cd is one of my favorites. I give most of the songs 9/10 or 10/10, but, \\"Fly like a Bird\\" blows them all away. I hope she makes a video.

B000H30B2C|5.0|King Kong is Peter Jackson's epic, mega-budget, fanboy love letter to the film that inspired him to become a movie director in the first place. Clocking in at double the running time of the original, Jackson's film is an ambitious juggernaut of a movie that, like his The Lord of the Rings films, is epic in scale and scope and yet still has that personal touch. One of the common complaints leveled at the movie is its bloated running time and this new version is even longer but this is more than self-indulgence on Jackson's part. He spends more time developing his characters, their motivations and their relationships. Even the excessive and extensive dinosaur sequences in the second act are there for a reason.<br /><br />Like the extended versions of the Lord of the Rings films, Kong is spread out over two discs with extras sprinkled over them and a third disc with an in-depth look at the making of this epic feature.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by co-writer/director Peter Jackson and co-writer/producer Philippa Boyens. In a nice touch, Jackson makes it a point not to talk about any material covered in the various documentaries or in the production diaries. So, this track isn't bogged down with technical information but with more of an emphasis on how they tried to capture the spirit of the historical period, character motivation, references to the original Kong and filming anecdotes. This is a solid, chatty track packed with loads of information and told in an engaging way that really conveys how much of a labour of love it was for Jackson.<br /><br />Also included are 16 deleted scenes that total 46 minutes. There are optional introductions to each scene by Jackson who puts them into the context of the movie and briefly explains why they were cut. Best of all, he explains that with this extended cut he didn't simply throw all of it back into the movie but made choices and explains them here.<br /><br />\\"The Eighth Blunder of the World\\" is an 18 minute blooper reel of the cast goofing around on the set and flubbing their lines (especially potty mouth Jack Black).<br /><br />\\"The Missing Production Diary\\" was not included on any previous DVDs and documents shoot day #59. The actors get to see footage that they just shot on video monitors so that they can adjust their performance. The cast begin to get \\"addicted\\" to watching themselves in this amusing extra.<br /><br />\\"A Night in Vaudeville\\" features uncut footage that they shot of the vaudeville performances including audition footage and archival film that they used as a basis.<br /><br />\\"King Kong Homage\\" juxtaposes scenes and lines from the original with their verbatim recreation in Jackson's film. We also see some of the exact references to the original and also inclusion of props from the film that came from Jackson's personal collection.<br /><br />The second disc features \\"Pre-Visualization Animatics\\" for four scenes with optional music from the movie. This extra allows you to see scenes as they were originally conceived via computer animation.<br /><br />\\"The Present\\" is an amusing short film that the cast created for Jackson's birthday. It started off as a simple idea, a funny goof but, as Andy Serkis explains, it got more elaborate with an actual storyline as Jackson's present exchanges many hands on its way to him.<br /><br />Also included are three trailers.<br /><br />\\"Weta Collectibles\\" takes us on a brief tour of the elaborate sculptures for the creatures that inhabit Skull Island and how some of them have since been transformed into finely crafted collectibles for fans.<br /><br />The third disc features an in-depth look at the film entitled \\"Recreating the Eighth Wonder, the Making of King Kong,\\" an eight-part documentary that you can watch in its entirety or its individual segments. This doc goes on to take an in-depth look at the pre-production phase as various crew members explain how they came right off making the last Rings movies with virtually the same crew but not as much time to prepare. One highlight is Jackson and Naomi Watts' meeting with Fay Wray, which was an extremely emotional day for the director. He was deeply saddened by her death in 2004 as he had hoped to have her do a cameo in his film. Amazingly, there is little repetition from the production diaries in these expertly crafted featurettes.<br /><br />Finally, there are the \\"Conceptual Design Video Galleries,\\" montages set to music of sketches, paintings and artwork from the 1996 attempt to make Kong, the Venture, Skull Island, New York City and Kong. It's interesting to see how close the film resembles a lot of the art, especially the Venture, Skull Island and New York City.ing the last Rings movies with virtually the same crew but not as much time to prepare.

0618680004|3.0|This book, and the similar ones that are coming out these days, are important.  I want to applaud Dawkins for continuing to fight the good fight, which is so important to humanity.  Without men and women like him we will find ourselves slipping back into the Dark Ages of ignorance, violence, prejudice and repression.<br /><br />Still, Dawkins' book is not perfect.  He includes Bible references that I think are inappropriate, and does not include others that matter even more. For example, Dawkins refers several times to Abraham's nearly sacrificing his son, Isaac, to the god of the Old Testament, and what a reprehensible story that was.  But at the time human sacrifice - even of one's children - was rather common.  The fact that the god of the Old Testament changed his mind was actually a step forward for the humanity of the time.<br /><br />I wish, instead, that Dawkins had emphasized the story of Adam and Eve.  After deciding to eat of the Tree of Good and Evil - the tree of knowledge - the god of the Old Testament punishes them (and Satan).  Here is the first instance in which religion doing its best to quench curiosity and free inquiry - the first instance of religion's repressive nature.  This is the key problem of religion - is that it stifles the search for the truth.<br /><br />The other problem, I fear, is that The God Delusion will not do as much as it could to persuade those who need persuading.  Some of the arguments are not that easy to follow, and occasionally Dawkins writes about believers in a way that, although humorous, is derogatory.  Dawkins may only be preaching to the choir.  On the other hand, it's a message which needs to set the choir on fire.  We can't take the right to conduct free inquiry and scientific thought for granted.
B00005JPCY|4.0|MOVIE: Tony Scott is one of my favorite directors and it's too bad he has had some ups and downs recently. I was really looking forward to Deja Vu after I saw the travesty that was Domino. Then Ridley's movie came out and flopped hard. So I was in the mood for a good Scott film, thankfully Deja Vu is a sharp thriller that bleeds Tony Scott's ultra visual style. The plot is a bit over the top, but it's not so preposterous that you won't be able to enjoy the film. Essentially a terrorist blows up a ferry filled with navy soldiers on leave in New Orleans. ATF Agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is assigned with the case of solving the crime and motive for destroying the ferry. An agent played by Val Kilmer offers Carlin the opportunity to solve the case by using a technology that is able to see any event 4 days in the past, a wormhole if you will. Carlin tries to map out the terrorist's location by studying a young woman's accidental involvement. The terrorists is played superbly by Jim Caviezal and the young woman is played by Paula Patton. Doug Carlin decides to use the machine to throw himself back in time to prevent the act thus saving the lives of hundreds of people. If you can suspend your belief for 2 hours then this film is simply great action entertainment.<br /><br />The script was written by first time screenwriter Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio who has gained fame for co-writing the Pirates Of The Caribbean films. Tony Scott made this film his own and kept things really tight and focused. The scenes where the group of people are searching back in time to focus on certain locations for clues reminds me of the camera work that Scott used in Enemy Of The State. Scott's last two films (3 including Beat The Devil) relied heavily on his highly stylized exposures and quick paced editing. Man On Fire used this style to perfection while Domino was just a way for him to show it off some more. Deja Vu does have that same style but there is so much less of it, very similar to the way Spy Game was shot. He uses lots of close-ups, which make the movie really tense because we are always staring right into the eyes of the characters. Every time Tony Scott works with Denzel Washington it seems like a winner. Crimson Tide and Man On Fire were two extremely extraordinary action films. We also have Jerry Bruckheimer producing, which is great because he has such a great history with both Tony Scott and Ridley Scott.<br /><br />One thing that I always look forward to when I see a Tony Scott film is the score by Harry Gregson-Williams. Harry Gregson-Williams is #2 favorite composer behind Hans Zimmer, and his electronic style matches Tony Scott's vision so perfectly. Tony Scott originally worked with Hans Zimmer and Zimmer scored Days Of Thunder, Crimson Tide, The Fan, and True Romance for Tony Scott. I guess Ridley Scott decided that he wanted Hans all to himself, so Harry Gregson-Williams was assigned the job of co-composer for Enemy Of The State and the two have worked together ever since. If you recall Spy Game's score and Man On Fire's score you could probably place your finger right in the middle of those two and sort of get a feel for the score for Deja Vu. Harry Gregson-Williams didn't go balls out like he did with Domino, but resorts to the piano and the occasional single trumpet to create tension. Strings back up the electronic parts of the score that has Harry Gregson-Williams written all over it. An interesting thing to note was that he used a unique technique of having the orchestra play the music in reverse and then forwarding it in the computer so as to create a unique feel for the central theme of Deja Vu. From what I can tell he only did that on the first cue during the opening credits where we see the logos. A terrific score that really enhances the film greatly.<br /><br />ACTING: When you have Denzel Washington as your lead actor it rarely means a bad movie. As I mentioned before, Denzel Washington has collaborated with Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer many times before. You can sense that everyone feels like they are in their element because the cast and crew are close. Another tidbit worth mentioning is that there is one scene where we see the young woman played by Paula Patton babysitting a little girl. That girl is Elle Fanning, sister of Dakota Fanning who played Pita in Scott's Man On Fire. Anyway, back to Denzel, he creates a great character here. Jim Caviezal was actually incredibly good as the terrorist. The only downside to that role is that the guy is just mentally unstable and that's why he does everything that he does, which is not very original when it comes to bad guys these days. Paula Patton plays Claire and while she doesn't really craft a character in this film she does provide support for Denzel Washington's character. Val Kilmer enters in his middle-aged scruffy mode and isn't the main focus of the supporting cast, but his presence is nice and he adds some credibility to the cast.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Deja Vu may be a little farfetched, but I really liked it as a sharp and smart piece of action entertainment. It was tense and kept me involved all the way through. There were no slow pockets in the film whatsoever. The fact that the bad guy is just a man with psychological problems makes the movie a little unoriginal, but Deja Vu will entertain you and is worth the price of admission.Bruckheimer many times before.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|I can't believe that some people still have the nerve to say that Lester's campy crap (hey let's see if we can kill the superman series) is better than Donner's cut!  You should be shipped off to the phantom zone!  Donner's cut kept the feel and emotion of the original Superman which he started.  This second Superman was supposed to be a continuation of the 1st one and Donner's cut does this justice.  I will admit that the ending can't hold up well, but besides being better than Lester's, it was too late, Donner had to use old footage and whatever he had 30 years later because he was never given the opportunity to film an ending.  Anybody who thinks the Lester Paris shots are better than the incredible Lois drawing Clark over Superman and jumping out the window at the Daily Planet, are not true Superman fans.  Lester using Superman's mother compared to using Donner's Brando is crazy.  Donner's cut with the interaction of Superman and Jor-El are so much more emotionally charged.  Especially after he loses his power and Jor-El gives a stern stare to Lois who is watching wearing Superman's shirt.  Classic!  Jor-El having to give up his spirit so Superman can have his powers back, showing how as a father you must always try to help your children even though they may make some big mistakes.  Those scenes are not even in the same league as Lester's (Oh, look I found a green crystal now lets move on).  And how can you compare Donner's version of Lois shooting Clark to prove he is Superman over Lester's lame Clark tripping and having his hand touch the fire.  Are you kidding me?!  And having Clark bumbling around while Lois jumps into Niagara is so campy and lame that it's embarrassing!  What was Lester thinking?!  Lester's camp made the villains look like idiots instead of challenging opponents for Superman as Donner's cut made them to be.  If only Donner would have been allowed to finish his creation we could have had an amazing 3rd and 4th Superman keeping to the Superman 1 standard!  What a shame.  Christopher Reeve would be so proud to know that thanks to us LOYAL fans Donner's cut got made and now the world can see the true magic of Christopher Reeve's Superman.  Now we can forget the lameness Lester put him through.  Long live Donner's Christopher Reeve Superman!!!!

B000B8QG4A|1.0|When I was a child I was fascinated by this movie as still I am now. I won't give my opinion about the movie because it would be to repeat what has already been written by nearly everyone.<br />But I always kept in my memory another movie in which Walt Disney explains in a very charming and interesting way the process of making Lady and the Tramp (the storyboards, discussions with the team, technical methods, etc. and the fascinating process of the drawers creating this delightful work). It was shown on tv and I can say that, in a way, without exaggerating, the watching of these people, their style, their personalities has influenced me for the rest of my life.<br /><br />When I saw that the special edition of Lady and the Tramp included many extras I didn't hesitate to buy it.<br /><br />I have it now. The delivery by Amazon has been perfect, right on schedule, as nearly always. Amazon is a serious company.<br /><br />But I want to express some critical opinions about this issue:<br />As I went directly to the extras to meet my beloved Walt Disney and sat down to listen to him, I was faced with a repulsive range of strange and ugly people who have nothing to do with the ones who made the original movie. Not only by their disgusting aspects, but also by the things they say, the way they expose their comments, the mentality, minds and the sense of aesthetics and responsibility that you can automatically feel at first watch.<br /><br />These ill-minded people may own the rights to make business with what they legally own. But these people don't have dignity. They mix up the concepts of owning something with being something. They should be reminded that they are not charming, that they are not interesting, they are not important and that they are unable to do a thing like the one they bought the rights to make business with.<br />It is an insult to the culture and to the same Walt Disney that they appear on screen behaving like the legitimate successors of Disney (I mean successors of his genius, as they pretend). It is obvious that Disney wouldn't have had such people on his team.<br />Without any trace of shame they talk about the movie in a way as if they had done it, taking, among other examples, possession of abandoned storyboards and dubbing them with their voices. Don't they realise that the masterpiece has already been done? That the parts that Disney did not include were the result of a meticulous process of selection?<br />They mix the comments of Disney with theirs creating an unpresentable contrast and a feeling of frustration when seeing Walt Disney's expositions always interrupted.<br />But they need to be the protagonists of it. Their inferiority complex resulting of their lack of culture mixed up with the arrogance of the one that is economically powerful, and their little love for the country allow them to show themselves runing into the prestige of other people desecrating what is a reference to the prominence and culture, not only of America but also of the Western world.<br /><br />I could extend my opinion longer but I leave it here, hoping that I am understood.<br /><br />I really think that it is just a small example of how things are changing, of how the elites have changed. It is our responsibility to be aware of it and work to make possible a world in which new Walt Disneys could crop out again. If we let these people take over the world in all fields, then we can say: poor Disney, poor children, poor America and poor West.<br /><br />The original movie, anyway, remains incomparable.<br />Disney made it for us, not they. He could, they would never be able to.<br /><br />---<br /><br />It has to be said that this review was posted in 2006. I was surprised when seeing the large amounth of people that found it interesting (helpful). Some years later the review and the opinions related suddenly disappeared. After complaining it appeared again (but without coments and ratings).<br /><br />Whas it a casual incident or not?<br /><br />Maybe it is, who knows, but the more I know the people I am pointing in this review (although I don't mention their name or religion), the more I am inclined to think that it was due to a meticulous wordwide process of censorship that is being carried on eveywhere, with open evidence but with the most strict silence and lack of criticism on any media (which they control).
B000AL730O|5.0|\\"Chaos and Creation\\" is one of Paul McCartney's strongest solo recordings, along with \\"Flaming Pie\\", \\"Tug Of War\\", and of course \\"Band On The Run\\".  The tunes are of the stick-in-your-head variety, many of them featuring interesting chord progressions that lend a poignancy to the proceedings.  Lyrically things are kept direct and simple - in a good way.  Think in terms of \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" instead of \\"All Together Now\\" and \\"Bip Bop\\".  In fact it's the simplicity of the lyrics playing off the richness of the melodies that has always defined Paul at his best. <br /> <br />Nigel Godrich's touch is perfect here, avoiding the over-production that has sagged quite a few post-Beatle efforts.  Things are kept stripped down to Beatle-esque pianos and guitars, tasteful strings, and trademark fluid bass lines a la Abbey Road.  There are even some fun touches here and there, such as the recorder on \\"English Tea\\" and a Venus-and-Mars synth cameo on \\"Promise To You Girl\\". <br /> <br />Buy the CD and you will enjoy it immensely!
B0002858YS|5.0|Seldom does an album come along where every song is worth listening to repeatedly. Hot Fuss is one of those rare exceptions. Whether a listener will enjoy the music is a matter of personal preference. But if you do like the Killers, you certainly like the majority of songs on this album.<br /><br />Like most performers, The Killers produce songs that have an acquired taste. Over time, you will find more and more of the songs on Hot Fuss appealing. In many cases, the songs have a buildup similar to those of Depeche Mode, where there is a great deal of anticipation during the escalating tempo. I find songs like \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" excellent for hardcore weightlifting because of this buildup.<br /><br />While their genre hard to describe, the Killers sound similar to the Stokes with a little Cure, Depeche Mode and the Clash mixed in. Sublime [not the group Sublime, but Webster's definition] in many circumstances, there are coherent messages behind many of the songs on Hot Fuss. Others are just fund to listen to. Though, from my perspective, the verse \\"I wanna shine on in the hearts of men\\" in the \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" is simply inspiring.

This director's cut, in restoring MSJ's original vision lost in the studio-diminished theatrical release, lofts a previously entrancing tale to rarified heights.  Daredevil's lair morphs into a rare solace from the intolerable modern world; Elektra's death marks the final, bittersweet divorce of art and commerce.  Watch this picture with an open mind, and ask... is MSJ the true \\"Man Without Fear\\"?<br /><br />If the restrictive Amazon rating system allowed me to give the film 4.45 stars, I would.  Delightful.
B000HX6DCO|5.0|Warning: Anyone that will cry about the content of this film is too easily offended for the humor of South Park. Quite simply, some people are meant for it and some people are not. Don't use your personal perceptions to ruin it for others. <br /> <br />Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is exactly like watching 5 of your favorite Southpark episodes, rammed together, with the craziness and humor amped ten notches, and without an annoying *beep* everytime someone curses. The only reason there is so much cursing is because one of the central plots of the film is actually the topic of cursing. Dur. <br /> <br />The film includes everyone's favorite characters; including some you may have forgotten. It inroduces a few new ones, but not too many. The musical numbers are so involved and hilarious that they make the film infinitely more memorable than it already was. You'd never believe it came from the same two guys who whip out show after show after show every season. The movie is so much MORE. If you can laugh at stupid, you will not be disappointed.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|This disc is a totally different sound for the group. Korn tried this unsuccessfully with Untouchables. Although this disc is nothing like follow the Leader, Korn, or Issues, it is still a great sound and worth a listen. At first I thought this disc was insipid. But I just gave it a second chance and I'm glad I did.
B000AA4LAK|5.0|Seldom does an album come along where every song is worth listening to repeatedly. Hot Fuss is one of those rare exceptions. Whether a listener will enjoy the music is a matter of personal preference. But if you do like the Killers, you certainly like the majority of songs on this album.<br /><br />Like most performers, The Killers produce songs that have an acquired taste. Over time, you will find more and more of the songs on Hot Fuss appealing. In many cases, the songs have a buildup similar to those of Depeche Mode, where there is a great deal of anticipation during the escalating tempo. I find songs like \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" excellent for hardcore weightlifting because of this buildup.<br /><br />While their genre hard to describe, the Killers sound similar to the Stokes with a little Cure, Depeche Mode and the Clash mixed in. Sublime [not the group Sublime, but Webster's definition] in many circumstances, there are coherent messages behind many of the songs on Hot Fuss. Others are just fund to listen to. Though, from my perspective, the verse \\"I wanna shine on in the hearts of men\\" in the \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" is simply inspiring.

Although I was already a successful owner of two million-dollar companies, it made me pause and think about how I had reached that position.<br /><br />Understanding the concept of leverage is worth its weight in gold. Don't expect to find all the answers here, but do read it carefully for the philosophy of what it means to be an employee vs an entrepreneur.<br /><br />I also bought Kiyosaki's games to teach my kids the basics of income and expenses in a fun way. We had a great time. :-)
B000FGGE68|5.0|Milla Jovovich was awesome in this movie. the fight scenes are spectacular.Milla is so sexy with long dark hair. She reminds me of a futuristic Xena and the part where she gets her weapons remind me of something out of Cygirls.The extras were cool,I was a little disappointed they didn't add the theatrical trailer to the extras menu. I really enjoyed Millas comentary when watching the movie she is really funny especially the shot with her butt. this movie is more interesting than Bloodrayne and Aeon Flux
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|First of all, this review is from an overall view of all of Incubus' discography, not just the 13 songs in the album. Im not going to say that Light Grenades is the best Incubus album, or that this makes the top 5 list of the decade. This album represents another step in the long ladder to greatness Incubus intends to climb. This is another chapter in the constant evolution of their music. You cannot possibly expect them to sing the same funk-metal from SCIENCE at age 30, the same way you wouldnt expect the 1969's Beatles to write songs like \\"Love me do\\" for every album. Each band gorws, evolves into something else after each experience, they tend to explore new grounds, not just to please the one-album-hooked fan, but to leave a mark in musical history. The great achievement of this band is that in 10 years, they have released 5 excellent records; every one different form the others, and not one of them is mediocre. And whats so good about Light Grenades? It never bores you. Its soft and hard, its weak and strong, its fast and slow, its a dynamic piece that doesnt wear out. If you like bands that change in time without selling out, bands like Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead and Placebo, bands that after 15 years still have guts to give and sounds that matter, you will not be dissapointed with this album, trust me.
0385751060|5.0|I am not a big word user, and I'm not telling the whole story again, as some do, but this is a book that I could not put down. It touched my heart, having two small boys myself, I can see and feel deeply how this book can teach children and adults the horrors of the Holocaust, we should NEVER forget! <br /> <br />
B000GPIPT2|5.0|There's no denying it, with the release of Dick Briefer's THE MONSTER OF FRANKENSTEIN, Dark Horse's SHADOW OF FRANKENSTEIN, and now Universal's 75th ANIVERSERY EDDITION OF FRANKENSTEIN, this is a great year for monster lovers! <br /> <br />Uncut, digitally remastered for a crystal clear picture, so clear you can see the wrinkles on the sky backdrop during the windmill scenes, and loaded with extras features not seen on other DVD versions of the film!   I happily recommended this version to monster lovers and classic movie watchers everywhere. <br />
B000I5X824|5.0|This CD is a must have for any die hard Staind Fan..but it also is perfect for anyone who just enjoys their music. It has songs from all five of their CD's. Plus, it has acoustic covers of two other well known rock songs. The Singles is just a great CD for one and all period end of story!
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|I don't have too much to add to all the other reviews about this album. Although melodically I found it quite acceptable I can't ignore the fact that most (if not all) the lyrics of the album are love centered.  <br /> <br />I think it lacks the rage that other Incubus albums had, well perhaps except \\"Morning View\\". But after \\"A Crow Left of the Murder\\" I was definitely waiting for something deeper and was left quite dissapointed.  <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend it but I hope that the Incubus gets pissed off once again and overcome this softie album.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Just thanks for demonstrate only one thing: Tim Burton (and the others dudes) are punks who made a very bad service to a great character like Batman. This is a real movie! Thanks again.
0446528056|2.0|Why I listen to Sparks books I do not know. The Notebook remains the only book I've ever read in a single setting, but all his others, even that one, are all of a single form and have so many cliche thoughts that they are hard to read. Dear John is one of the same. You get an unlikely pair forming a relationship. One or both must deal with disorder/tragedy. In this case, John's father has Aspergers. That's just the beginning  on that end as this book has more disorders than usual. Every Sparks book has characters who must deal with this (cancer, Alzheimers, children with learning disabilities, etc etc) and Dear John is no different. Nor is it different as it deals with tragedy. You know going in that people will die. To his credit, all people die, it's just hard when they die in cliche ways of cliche causes and leave the cliche grievers behind. But hey, maybe that's why he sells so many books and movies. I did feel a little for the characters but because we read every thought and action and leave nothing to interpretation, I wasn't fully able to feel the characters. There is simply a limit as to how real a puffy Sparks novel can feel.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This was an experience, an orgasm for the ears. I was a bit skeptic about it, thinking it would be like those awful jazz albums with a techno beat. This was far from that and far from awful. I was amazed by how new this sounded. I really felt like The Beatles themselves had recorded this today. I really felt the spirit of the music.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this album, except that it made me happy. That is the feeling you get from 'Love' and you can feel it when you are sitting there, submerged in 5.1 surround sound. Brilliant, absolutely Brilliant.
B000IMV4IW|5.0|.. Then look elsewhere. Stop The Clocks has come about due to the end of Oasis' recording contract with Sony BMG Music Entertainment, who wanted cash in on Oasis. Noel Gallagher has explained that he insisted that it had to be a 'best-of' because he felt a compilation of the best singles, album tracks and b-sides would produce a stronger album than a compilation of singles. <br />But if you like Oasis at all, even just Wonderwall, then buy this album! It really showcases Oasis, and you'll be hooked no doubt!
0452286751|5.0|The Fountainhead is not a great literary achievement, but a great book because of its powerful two (maybe one)dimensional characters. Like the greatest of the American Cowboy movies, written in the era of those movies, it is a classic staged drama, a mid-Twentieth century work of stolid art. So if you loved Hopalong Cassidy and Randolph Scott, and could never wait for the cowboy to ride off in the sunset...this book is for you (and me.)  <br /> <br />Amazingly Ayn Rand became a figure(fountain)head and people met to discuss her ideas.  I suppose a movie \\"group\\" could discuss John Wayne, but why?  <br /> <br />Read the book and love it. It is a major work, of fun.  <br /> <br />
0679735909|2.0|I expect to get some snarls from the readers who LOVE this novel, but I'm with Mr. Tomlinson, who wrote a very negative review below. I wouldn't say it's the worst novel I've ever read but possibly the worst story I've read in a long time.<br /><br />The writing is quite intelligent, the prose lovely, The fairy tales are kind of fun- I started skipping over them to get back to the STORY, and the poetry is quite wonderful- though I started skipping over the poems, too- especially the two-pagers- to...get back to the STORY.<br /><br />And there's the rub: what should have been a fascinating story gets lost amongst all the fairy tales, poems, letters, asides, and the ongoing feminist theme. The four main characters are flat; the two living characters have no gumption and seem to be going through the motions, and the poets- the other two Victorian 'main characters'- never come alive -until Ms Byatt FINALLY writes them as living, breathing people by going back in time and SHOWING us actual scenes and dialogue. Otherwise, you'll only 'see' them through the eyes of the two modern-day protagonists, and through the Victorian poets' often tedious letters and journals.<br /><br />There's very little tension in the novel, in my humble opinion, except that created by the rival modern day researchers. If the two historic characters had been real poets, I could understand much of the trite wording of the letters. But those letters are just an aspect of Ms Byatt's imagination and so are tedious.<br /><br />The book is 555 pages. I stopped reading at page 299 and skipped to the end, where I saw Ms Byatt has wrapped everything up in a pretty bow- the resolution- where we discover thet Maud, the .... main modern protagonist, has been researching to discover her own genetic past- she's the Victorian poets' great great? great great great? grand daughter (they had a love child who was farmed out to an unknown couple or soeme such). This could have been an ongoing compelling aspect of the novel and Maud's characterization, but...nooo...<br /><br />The last aspect of this novel that I found frustrating was the POV. I don't mind author intrusion but A.S. Byatt makes us aware on every page that SHE'S in charge here. We never really get inside any of the characters' heads long enough to really care.ect of the novel and Maud's characterization, but...nooo...  <br /> <br />The last aspect of this novel that I found frustrating was the POV.

B00007KWHO|3.0|I don't know how to review \\"Time and a Word\\". It's a unique Yes album, and it has some fascinating moments, but there are a few things about it that aren't so great, (one being that the \\"expanded and remastered\\" version doesn't like to play in my BenQ laptop's CD drive! Plays on everything else though, and everything else plays on my CD drive. Ah well).     It's their second album, first released in 1970, and featuring Jon Anderson on vocals, Chris Squire on bass, Peter Banks on guitar, Tony Kaye on keyboards and Bill Bruford on drums. There's also a few orchestral arrangements here and there, which sometimes enhance the tracks (I really like the swirling strings on the energetic \\"No Opportunity Neccessary, No Experience Needeed\\"), but they clutter things up now and then. The production is a bit colourless, kind of like the cover. It sounds old, much older than \\"The Yes Album\\" which came out the next year. It's a unique sound, though, and I quite like it.    Being earlier Yes, it's interesting to hear a few bits and pieces of melody they'd reuse in later songs. There's a keyboard theme that sounds a lot like one from \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans'\\" track \\"The Revealing Science of God\\", and another keyboard theme in \\"The Prophet\\" sounds like the vocal line from \\"Fragile's\\" tune \\"The Fish\\". Speaking of which, Tony Kaye's playing and gritty organ tone is pretty cool, so is Peter Banks' guitar work, I love the speedy solo he plays in \\"Everydays\\".    The remaster features a new booklet (with the British cover of the girl on the front and the American cover with the picture of the \\"Yes Album\\" era band on the back) and four bonus tracks. The booklet contains pics of the band around the time of the album, liner notes by Mike Tiano discussing the \\"Time and a Word\\" era and the making of the album, and full lyrics for everything except for the bonus track \\"Dear Father\\". I really like this version of \\"Dear Father\\", originally a B-side to the \\"Sweet Dreams\\" single. It's rare tohave a bonus track as your favorite from a CD, but this one is mine from \\"Time and a Word\\". With cryptic, vaguely biblical lyrics, and a big harmonious chorus, it's kind of for Yes what \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" is for Genesis, I reckon. The other three bonus tracks are alternate mixes of \\"No Opportunity Neccessary, No Experience Needed\\", \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"The Prophet\\" which appeared in various places back in the 1970s. They're not too different, but the orchestra is toned down a bit and you get to hear a bit more of Peter Banks' guitar playing.    Probably not the first Yes album for a newcomer to get (\\"The Yes Album\\" or \\"Close to the Edge\\" might be better.) but it's fairly pleasant music, with a couple of nice surprises waiting there for fans who've never heard it all before.
B000H305U0|5.0|All I can say is, \\"Studio 54 if we get the props right\\"~Timbaland <br /> <br />I liked Justified, but I LOVE FUTURESEX/LOVESOUNDS. I like to dance (not booty shake, but actually dance), so this album is perfect for anyone who likes to dance. My FAVORITE TRACKS ARE: Love Stoned, My Love (the Interlude/Track), CHOP ME UP, What Goes Around & Losing My Way. I was very suprised & touched by Losing My Way. GREAT JOB JT.
B000002I4S|5.0|When people who are just getting into listening to jazz ask me which albums they should start with, I always recommend \\"Kind of Blue\\", and \\"Giant Steps\\". While this may not be Coltrane's most pure recording, it nonetheless is one of the finest jazz albums ever recorded. I'm not going to go into the specifics of his \\"sheets of sound\\" approach, other than to say that when he really gets going such as on the title track, his playing is absolutely breathtaking. It is important to mention however that aside from Coltrane's exceptional chops and phrasing, I find his tone on this disc to be one of warmest sounding I've ever heard on the instrument. If you don't own this CD, buy it!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|First of all let me start out by saying you are a `vintage' incubus fan clearly means that you do not understand the band.  Incubus always goes against the grain of their previous albums...you should expect that by now.  Every single album has been drastically different from every other album. <br /> <br />Second, for all of you that are saying that this album is over produced....you seem to have absolutely no concept of what production is.  Make Yourself was clearly the pinnacle of polish in the Incubus catalog.  Every song on that album has ProTools Magic written all over it.  Still a great album, but produced completely differently.  For ACLOTM and LG they used producer Brendan O'Brien who is a FANTASTIC producer, however he has a very different production style than Incubus previously used.  As proven by his work with bands like Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine, he is all about the live and edgy feel that gives music much more life than a ProTools record.  These songs would not have sounded right (musically AND stylistically) with that type of production.  It worked perfectly for the Make Yourself style of rock they were writing at the time, however these songs call for something different. <br /> <br />Also, as far as instrumentation goes, one thing that continuously bugs the heck out of me is the claim that Kilmore seems to be doing less and less.  As a DJ in a nationally touring Incubus tribute band, I can assure you that is definitely not the case.  Though he is doing less `scratching' he is actually doing more work than ever.  If you hadn't noticed, his live setup has gone from two turntables (S.C.I.E.N.C.E. days) to three turntables, a cd turntable, a Moog Voyager, Rhodes Keyboards, Theramin, Marxophone, and many other Dulcimer and piano type instruments.  Though his scratching has significantly decreased, his DJ parts are certainly as complex and involved as ever (and in my opinion are harder now than ever!)  This is exactly why they parted ways with DJ Lyfe, he only did hip-hop style scratch DJing, they were looking for someone who could blend in better and be another musical layer just like drums or guitar would be. <br /> <br />I personally feel that this album, musically, rivals anything that they have done to date.  Though it may not be as radio friendly (I have yet to hear a current radio station that doesn't suck completely!) I think that this album pushes all the same boundaries that they love to push and expands the Incubus song catalog in new directions that they have yet to touch.  The way I see Incubus is, inevitably, they will write a song or two that you will love.  With their ever changing style, they will assuredly touch on something that you like.  This will undoubtedly get you to check out some other Incubus tunes to see what else they have to offer.  Since their song catalog is so diverse, hopefully the experience will open you eyes to new styles and musical ideas.  I mean, this album made me want to listen to my Police and Pearl Jam records...neither of those bands sound anything like Incubus, but with the introduction of Light Grenades, they touch on some musical concepts that are fantastic references to those styles and ideas. <br /> <br />Finally, I would like to bring this review full circle and point out how every Incubus album to date has had an extreme backlash immediately following its release by many `old school' or `vintage' Incubus fans.  INCUBUS ALWAYS CHANGES, DON'T EXPECT IT TO SOUND EXACTLY LIKE THEIR OTHER SONGS THAT YOU LIKE!!! Also, if this many people are really losing their taste for Incubus, you would think they wouldn't have many fans left...yet they continue to gain more and more new fans by touching on new musical ideas and not just pleasing the fans that `already like them'.  This proves my idea about their pursuit of new music and how they will always write a couple songs that anybody would like. <br /> <br />As a final note to anybody who is talking crap (for whatever reason), I would just like to ask this question... <br /> <br />How many millions of records have YOU sold?!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is the CD I've been waiting for by Mayer.  He sounds as great as  any legendary musician whose music never gets old and tired.  I get the feeling that he did what he needed to do to get his name on the map but now he's doing what he really loves.  I guess that could be considered a criticism but who am I to judge such an outstanding CD.  Buy it.
B00005JPCA|5.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" lives up to the Bond legacy and is a stellar edition to the movie series. Okay, first up: Daniel Craig is an excellent James Bond. I love that he can give his all in grueling action scenes and still look dapper in a fitted tuxedo. I was overjoyed with Craig's performance. Next up is the plot which is supposed to be Bond's first case so don't be too alarmed to see Bond make some abysmal errors here and there. It's his first day on the job so we gotta cut him some slack. Who woulda thought that a casino game could be so intriguing? I sure didn't but it's in here. The action sequences are beautiful from Bond's non-stop chase after a suspect to another harrowing chase on an airport runway. I also liked the stripped down tone of the film. There were less inuendos and more realistic character performances. No schtick, just a pure action film. Overall, \\"Casino Royale\\" is an incredible film from the slick opening sequence to the end credits. Bond is soooo back.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Bob Fosse inspired himself in Fellini's 8 ½ to put in perspective the anthology of his own life. Some scrutinizing and sharp reflections, but with the lack of the well known geniality of Fellini the film slowly decreases in its own proposals and becomes interminable.<br /><br />Nevertheless I must acknowledge Roy Scheider made this lifetime performance.
B00000JSJC|2.0|The first scene in 'Strange Days' -- choreographed within one extended shot, for at least a few minutes -- is phenomenal in execution and possessing rare grit. The rest of the film doesn't follow suit.<br /><br />It's not a bad film by any means, and that's why I think it's such a boring experience; the cinematography is at times stellar, and likewise in its finer moments (of action, mostly) it can resemble the direction of James Cameron, and surely that's a huge compliment. On this minor subject, I tend to think that being Cameron wrote and produced the film, he at minimum had to have a reasonable role in \\"creating\\" the film -- my guess is he probably helmed certain scenes, in place of Bigelow). I say \\"reasonable\\", however, because the overall result is far, far lower than Cameron has ever directed, both in flair, substance and intellect. It might be more disturbing in some respects, but that doesn't necessarily make it bold or reflective.<br /><br />I really think, overall, the film suffers from its exaggerated sense of self-importance, when the storyline and characters don't provide much to empathize with. Therefore, the whole thing becomes a sort of drag -- one that just so happens to take place within a time and environment that's coated with a sordid ambiance. And regarding this -- what's with the seemingly anarchistic dystopia, only ---4--- years after the film was released? It seems the only reason they chose this time frame is to capitalize on, I guess, the fundamental appeal of \\"2k\\", but it has little relevance to the plot, if any. The problem, though, lies in the fact that the nasty, chaotic world in 'Strange Days' is far too unrealistic to be 1999 -- in terms of technology, first off (in concept it makes sense, but here we are in almost 2007 with no such devices; I'd say about 2020 might be a little more practical an estimate). Secondly, though, and more important, is the depiction of such a nihilistic mentality filled with sleaze. As has proved with time, we don't evolve from one state to another that quickly as a collective; in the four years between 1995 and 1999, a great number of things seem to have rapidly changed for the worse.<br /><br />Still, we can, in retrospect, look at a film like Ridley Scott's sci-fi classic 'Blade Runner' -- released back in 1982 and depicting a Human dystopia circa 2019 (which also happens to take place in L.A.), and though we can ponder the ideas and sentiments of the picture, we can also see, living in 2007, that his portrayal of a world 30 years from now was simply too bleak and one that will hardly match up to the Los Angeles of 2019. Compare Spielberg's contemporary take on a familiar time period (I don't remember exactly; something like 2050 I think), and we see the enormous contrast between each film's reality. This is inherently a risk of sci-fi located in the future, of course, but as 'Blade Runner' and a handful of others have proved, how much of a film's predictions matches up with the coming reality is not of absolutely essential importance, as long as it possesses depth and ideas that evoke thought on a more subtle, universal level. Not only does 'Strange Days' lack conveying these things, it seems almost asinine that they were SO obviously off target (I mean, c'mon!) in throwing this world at us and claim it's only 1999!<br /><br />Another thing I found within the film is that while it's dark and often grotesque, it's also unintentionally goofy. The acting ranges from good to pretty laughable, and these are by and large solid actors; one could argue the result in that respect is due to Bigelow.<br /><br />For a similar themed movie I'd recommend David Cronenberg's 'Videodrome', though one must go into that with some particular cautions. Even more akin among the two is Ralph Fiennes character to 'Videodrome's protagonist played by James Woods; in the first half hour of 'Strange Days', I literally thought he was aping, or perhaps homaging, Woods' performance given thecontext.<br /><br />Not a dismal effort overall, and it tries. As is pretty obvious, though, I for one don't care for it.ce given the context. <br /> <br />Not a dismal effort overall, and it tries. As is pretty obvious, though, I for one don't care for it.
0393324818|4.0|One of the reasons baseball fans remain so steadfast in their devotion is a sense of tradition. During interminable rain delays and constant pitching changes, broadcasters often wax nostalgic about how little has changed over the years: there have always been nine men on the field; bases are still 90 feet apart; three strikes and you're out. It's this comfort level that makes change so difficult, why people are opposed to innovation such as Astroturf, the designated hitter and inter-league play. \\"This is the way things have been done and this is how we're going to keep on doing them,\\" seems to be the general mindset of proponents of the old school.<br /><br />Lewis, in his thought-provoking Moneyball, makes one wonder if school will soon be out.<br /><br />Unable to spend as freely as their upscale brethren, small market teams like the Athletics must be content to scout the high school and college players other teams might find less desirable or to pick up the detritus of other clubs. In fact, while the A's own veteran scouts drooled over the \\"potential\\" (that damnable word) of talented schoolboy (i.e., high school) athletes, Beane preferred to go with the relatively more mature and established college prospects.<br /><br />The difference between the A's and other fiscally-challenged clubs, however, is their stunning success. Beane and his associates have managed to build pennant contenders seemingly out of straw.<br /><br />The new manner of assessing personnel could be considered almost a new age philosophy. Rather than looking for the hulking slugger who can bash balls out of sight, Beane and company seek a kinder, gentler athlete, one adept in the art of taking a pitch, making the opposition wear itself down. Why else would Beane aggressively pursue a nobody like Scott Hatteberg, a catcher left unsigned by his former team and whom no one else wanted, and convert him to a first baseman? Because Hatteberg is a master of how to \\"work the pitcher.\\"<br /><br />Lewis examines the influence of Bill James and his band of number-crunching \\"sabrematicians\\" on Beane's decision-making processes. Instead of batting average and runs batted in, James and his brethren advocated different statistical yardsticks such as on-base percentage and runs created. \\"The [traditional] statistics were not merely inadequate: they lied,\\" writes Lewis, \\"And the lies they told led the people who ran major league baseball teams to misjudge their players, and mismanage their games.\\"<br /><br />The author offers several examples of the A's forward thinking. As a group of batters gather around a video monitor to study pitch-by-pitch sequences, the author notes how \\"[t]hey're no longer playing a game; they're playing game theory.\\"<br /><br />The in-depth coverage of the draft process, with its tactics, subterfuges and stomach-churning tension, is a wonderful insight into this annual event. With the help of his laptop-clutching assistant, Beane carefully analyzed players' tendencies rather than raw numbers. Lewis compares the GM and his crew of \\"computer geeks\\" to \\"card counters at a blackjack table\\" (some might say the draft is actually more of a crap shoot). To carry the non-baseball analogy further: when describing the machinations involved in making Nicholas Swisher their first pick in 2002, it seems as if the author is writing not so much about baseball as about chess.<br /><br />Lewis tells this revolutionary tale with a mixture of keen insight, thoughtful prose and -- at times -- too much detail, which sometimes detracts from the overall picture. Many of his references are financial in nature, as when he speaks of \\"derivatives\\" -- those fragments of the game such as how the next pitch after a 1-1 count can make a huge difference in how a batter performs. Perhaps because of this, however, Lewis comes at the reader with a fresh set of eyes, remarking on issues the average fan fails to notice, both on the field and behind the scenes.uence of Bill James and his band of number-crunching \\"sabrematicians\\" on Beane's decision-making processes.

As a group of batters gather around a video monitor to study pitch-by-pitch sequences, the author notes how \\"[t]hey're no longer playing a game; they're playing game theory.\\" <br />The in-depth coverage of the draft process, with its tactics, subterfuges and stomach-churning tension, is a wonderful insight into this annual event. With the help of his laptop-clutching assistant, Beane carefully analyzed players' tendencies rather than raw numbers. Lewis compares the GM and his crew of \\"computer geeks\\" to \\"card counters at a blackjack table\\" (some might say the draft is actually more of a crap shoot). To carry the non-baseball analogy further: when describing the machinations involved in making Nicholas Swisher their first pick in 2002, it seems as if the author is writing not so much about baseball as about chess. <br />Lewis tells this revolutionary tale with a mixture of keen insight, thoughtful prose and -- at times -- too much detail, which sometimes detracts from the overall picture. Many of his references are financial in nature, as when he speaks of \\"derivatives\\" -- those fragments of the game such as how the next pitch after a 1-1 count can make a huge difference in how a batter performs. Perhaps because of this, however, Lewis comes at the reader with a fresh set of eyes, remarking on issues the average fan fails to notice, both on the field and behind the scenes.  <br />

B000006OBQ|5.0|I grew up with my parents playing the LP of this concert at every party and  <br />holiday gathering. <br /> <br />In 1966 my father had a convention in Las Vegas to attend.  He convinced my mother,  <br />who did not like to fly, to take the trip with him via train from NJ to Las  <br />Vegas.  When they finally arrived in Vegas, Mom & Dad realized that their teen idol <br />Frank Sinatra was playing at The Sands.  They were able to get tickets to  <br />attend this famous concert.  Prior to the concert, my Dad was trying to  <br />convince my mother to fly back to NJ instead of taking the train.  Mom <br />made a deal with Dad that if Frank sang \\"Come Fly With Me\\" that she would  <br />fly home.  The opening number was \\"Come Fly With Me\\" and Dad was  <br />delighted that they would be taking a flight back to NJ versus the train. <br /> <br />They loved Frank and thus their kids came to love him too.   <br />My six year old son loves \\"Sinatra At the Sands\\" and particularly \\"Chicago\\" & <br />\\"It Was A Very Good Year\\". <br /> <br />This is truly an excellent 5-star live recording that will delight any Sinatra fan.
B000I5Y8ZU|2.0|Great packaging, nice production job, cool costumes and few bands can pose and preen for the camera with more flair, but...with the exception of \\"MAMA\\" there isn't a single memorable song to be found on this CD. This is a well packaged bundle of half-realized ideas and undercooked tunes bashed out with great enthusiasm, but the whole thing is ultimately forgettable. Mere product disguised as a \\"concept\\" LP. Skippable.
0618680004|5.0|I can be considered one of those Dawkins sets out to \\"convert\\" at the beginning of his book. For me, the trouble with not being a believer always hinged on the \\"God-shaped gap\\" paradox. What's to replace God in his absence from my brain? Dawkin's last chapter left me more than confident that the world of science, nature, and reason can offer much more to passionately live for than religion ever can. <br /> <br />Now if I can just get over the atheist stigma. A reasonable and \\"non-extremist\\" coworker, upon seeing the book on my desk, exclaimed with the utmost sincerity, \\"But you're too nice to be soulless!\\" <br /> <br />To which I responded, \\"But you're too smart to be Christian!\\" <br /> <br />Guess who was more offended.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I must say that I, being one of those types of fans that will blindly buy a cd if it has the name of one of my favorite bands on it, went to my local Best Buy and bought this with only the tunes on myspace as a reference.  <br />   It's hard to be too hard on this new album because Incubus is the kind of band that is just too unique to be pigeonholed. They make it a part of their BEING that they change their style and feel each album. Some albums wind up cohesive and some albums end like LG.  <br />I think the only reason I feel like this cd lacks cohesion because it seems like they have almost combined the softer (sometimes cheesier) parts of Morning View with the more heavy elements of \\"..Murder\\". It just kind of feels like they're running low on ideas. The new ground that they tread on this album varies from an almost throw-back sound (\\"Paper Shoes\\" - a solid song with strong dynamics; has an almost psychadelic feel.) to 100% pure pop songs (\\"Diamonds and Coal\\"- probably my least favorite on the album.). <br />   Even with its faults, this cd is another representation of Incubus's refusal to do what is expected of them. I respect them for this reason when some of their songs may fall flat. For what it's worth, more of the songs succeed on here than not. It's all up to the listener's perception.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I will just reiterate what everyone else is saying about this DVD. This DVD is a must for Floyd fans, and worth a look for all others. I made my girlfriend watch this and she even liked it. She is more of a popular music fan. My favorite parts is when the producers/band members are in the studio filtering out some of the audio tracks giving a unique listen to many of the beloved cuts on this classic album.
0670038040|5.0|Since his inaugural case in  the 1970's Rumpole has busily defended one or another of the Timson clan (a large and industrious family of South London thieves) on various charges.  More than one of the cases Rumpole has previously chronicled involves a Timson unwisely befriending, trusting, and being betrayed by a Molloy (another large and industrious family of South London thieves).  Rumpole brilliantly wins each case by convincing the jury that the Timsons and Molloys are like the Hatfields and McCoys, and that the conniving Molloy has framed the hapless Timson.<br /><br />This case serves up a slight twist on that old plot, with Rumpole defending a Timson who unwisely befriended another Molloy, and at the same time defending a Pakistani doctor who married a Timson and whose affairs also cross paths with the Molloys.  Besides bringing Rumpole, the Timsons, and the Molloys into the 21st Century, Mortimer also manages to mix in huge doses of critique of anti-terrorism laws.  He's not too heavy-handed with his criticism, and the political commentary does not detract from the story.<br /><br />The first Rumpole stories were complex pieces of work, with numerous subplots involving Rumpole's colleagues swirling around the main mystery.  Mortimer's later efforts have been less complex, with Rumpole's chamber-mates at Number 4 Equity Court receding to the background as Rumpole's relationship with his wife Hilda (She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed) receives more attention.  The trend continues in this latest effort, with Soapy Sam Ballard, Phillida Erskine-Brown, Claude Erskine-Brown, Hoskins, and Henry the clerk receding into cardboard figures with little depth.  Still, \\"The Reign of Terror\\" was so engaging that I read it in one sitting.
0425200450|5.0|This was the first Agatha Christie novel I have ever read, but it will not be the last.  The detective in this book is the Belgium Inv. Poirot.  He boards a train to London, the Orient Express and during the trip one of the passengers is murdered.  The passenger approached Poirot before his murder asking to retain his services, but Poirot refused.  When the train is delayed due to weather, Poirot, his friend M. Bouc and a physician decide to figure out the murderer so when the police are able to get to them, they will already have it solved.  It is discovered that the murdered passenger was travelling under an alias and that he was an infamous kidnapper who killed a child from a prominent American family and changed his name and took the ransom money on the run.  This provides our motive and we just have to find the killer and the means of the murder.  They interview each suspect one by one and inspect their luggage.  They find several clues but as they dig deeper they find things are not always as they seem. There are suspects from various nationalities and economic backgrounds. Alibis, motives and movements are accounted for and then discredited leaving the reader wondering if the crime will be solved.  I can say one thing, I too often can predict the ending of a book, but I was totally surprised by this one.  I don't want to tell too many details because it would ruin the ending but it is an excellent story.
B0000027F8|5.0|Hmmm... if it is 2006 and you are reading this review because you are considering buying this CD, all I can ask is who are you? I cannot believe that anyone who likes George Michael would not already own this CD, seeing as it has been out for over 16 years.  <br /> <br />That said, this is one of my favorite CDs; definitely in my Top 10. This is actually the first CD that I found a way to \\"wear out\\" and had to buy a second copy (basically, repeated plays throughout the years resulted in the disc getting scratched, dinged and skipping during playback).  This CD is consistent from start to finish, without a weak song.  It is also a much better album than \\"Faith\\" and holds up better over repeated listens.   <br /> <br />This CD was underrated back in 1990, basically because of its somewhat somber tone, and because it did not have as many radio-friendly tracks as \\"Faith\\".  In fact, outside of \\"Freedom '90\\", it has no \\"radio friendly\\" material on it.  However, this CD is a consistently rewarding listen.  It is somber without being gloomy.  It retains George Michael's brand of pop music, and his unique sound, without being \\"commercial\\".  This was certainly not another \\"Faith\\" and in fact the only song from \\"Faith\\" that might sound at home on this release would be \\"Hand to Mouth\\". Otherwise, the album is a definite departure (albeit a very positive departure) for George. <br /> <br />Considering the time when this thing came out (i.e. the year of \\"Ice Ice Baby\\", \\"U Can't Touch This\\" and \\"Cherry Pie\\") this album was actually ahead of its time.  It is one of the few releases from 1990 (along with Depeche Mode's \\"Violator\\") that have aged well. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that this CD (along with the rest of George's solo and Wham! output) is in dire need of remastering.  As with most releases of the time, the CD sounds hollow (i.e. not deep enough bass, too much treble, very \\"tinny\\" sounding).  There is a warmth and depth to these songs that only a good remastering jobcould really bring out.  Considering George has patched up his relationship with Sony, and considering other than his back catalogue, George doesn't have much else to offer these days, I am surprised that this (and his other releases) have not yet been remastered. <br /> <br />That said, if you are considering buying this (again, where have you been the past 16 years?) you won't be disappointed.
B000301YY8|5.0|James Blunt is definitely one of the most successful newcomers around. His single \\"You're Beautiful\\" topped all the charts and is still a huge success. In Europe, though, he was also very successful with his other singles \\"Goodbye My Lover\\", \\"High\\" and, most notably, \\"Wisemen\\". All these fantastic songs can be found on his album \\"Back To Bedlam\\".<br /><br />\\"Back To Bedlam\\" is one of those rare albums with no filler tracks, nailing song after song after song. Blunt's style is mellow, nostalgic and melodramatic. He has a wonderful falsetto, which he often uses in his most emotionally charged ballads (\\"You're Beautiful\\", \\"Goodbye My Lover\\", \\"No Bravery\\"), but he never crosses the line of being corny or pathetic. Sure, there are a lot of artists of this style out there, but James Blunt is actually an awesome musician, a fantastic songwriter and a great singer. It is very hard to pick highlight-tracks, because they are all fantastic.<br /><br />If you are planning of buying this album (which you should), think about getting the Special Edition which can be found on Amazon, for only 16.97$. It features an extra CD, with a handful of goodies. It is worth an extra dollar or two!
B00005J9M3|5.0|When I bought this CD in 1990 I was HIGHLY disappointed.  After the synth pop of \\"West End Girls\\", \\"It's a Sin\\" and their remake of \\"Always on my Mind\\", I was expecting more of the same.  In fact, the only song that comes close to their synth-pop sound on this CD is \\"So Hard\\" and that song is the weakest link on this CD. <br /> <br />Over time, and it did not take very long, I came to really enjoy this CD.  It has a depth and texture to it that only reveals itself on repeated listens.  The lyrics are also much more blatantly gay than anything PSB had written up to that time, but still have that coy late '80s-early '90s double-entendre that requires a bit of deciphering.  They would, of course, completely drop that facade with \\"Very\\" and \\"Bilingual\\" and it is doubtful that in this day and age an artist could ever write such cryptically gay lyrics ever again.  But, deciphering the lyrics is part of the beauty of this album. <br /> <br />The other beauty of this album is the sound.  When PSB went about making this album, they traveled to Germany to work with Harold Faltermeyer because he had many, many old analogue synthesizers.  This gives the album a very different sound from the typical PSB high-energy dance-pop fare.   <br /> <br />Yet, even without the high-energy dance-pop tunes this album still works on so many levels.  \\"Being Boring\\" is arguably one of their best songs ever, and the rest of the songs (other than \\"So Hard\\") don't fall far behind.  I can't say that most of the songs on this CD vary greatly from each other.  In fact, many of the songs are almost interchangeable in their mood and sound.  However, rather than being monotonous, that similarity actually adds to the overall structure of the CD and makes it a very compelling listen from start to finish.  In other words, the songs are not repetitive, but instead their similarity helps them hold together as one unit. <br /> <br />The 2001 reissue with remastered sound and the bonus disc is a nice treat.It comes with the lyrics (the original CD did not) and a commentary on each track by Neil and Chris (similar to the booklet in the limited edition of 1995's \\"Alternative\\").  My only complaint about the bonus disc is that, since I already owned \\"Alternative\\" I was a bit disappointed that the bonus disc for this release had many of those same songs.   <br /> <br />But, this the Pet Shop Boys and remastered sound and expanded packaging make this the edition worth buying.  Plus, this is the Pet Shop Boys and don't they seem to have a way of getting their fans to buy three copies of what is essentially the same CD (albeit in somewhat altered \\"incarnations\\")? <br /> <br />Overall, a very rewarding listen.  If you don't like it after the first play (and you may not) give it a chance.  This one will DEFINITELY grow on you.  It's also an opportunity to hear PSB in a very different way.
B00008S2VG|5.0|She has done it again! Re-invention is something Madonna does best, and the results are often gorgeous: \\"American Life\\" is an album which is politically challenging, cheeky and controversial - Queen of Pop at her best!<br /><br />From the title song, with its upbeat music and rap sequence (!), to questioning the meaning of it all in \\"Easy Ride\\", Madge's electrifying album is truly a delight. Her voice is fantastic, and Mirwais Ahmadzai's (a French techno mastermind and Madonna's partner in crime) instrumentals are simply mind-blowing. Unlike her previous album critics often refer to, \\"American Life\\" has it's storyline, a deep emotional plot and subtle twists and subplots (like the latest James Bond jingle \\"Die Another Day\\", or the retrospective \\"Mother and Father\\"), making it a combination of Music's tunes and Ray of Light's substance. Although it carries the weight of social commentary, it's so much fun!
B000005ALN|4.0|... and didn't buy it... and I don't know why.  I wrote many, many papers in college in 1996, '97, '98 while listening to this CD and even today it is a CD that I never get tired of listening to.  Anyone who heard \\"Listen Without Prejudice\\" is a moron if they were shocked by the somber tone of this CD.  It basically picks up where \\"Listen\\" left off... albeit with George dropping a few more hints about his then-secret (well, to him at least) sexuality. <br /> <br />That said, this is not a sexually-charged album.  Rather, it is simply a moody, somber, jazz-flavored pop album.  If you want something that you can put on and relax to at the end of a rough day, this is it.  The only real pop song on this is \\"Fastlove\\" and that song is not representative of the rest of the CD. <br /> <br />If you like Pet Shop Boys' \\"Behavior\\" and Massive Attack's \\"Protection\\" then you will like this CD because it has the same sort of moody atmosphere of those releases.  If you have no idea what I just referred to then you probably should buy something else...

The second disk is called \\"Live in Ireland\\" and it is a live performance of most of the songs from the album, with three new tracks - \\"Where Is My Mind?\\", \\"Fall At Your Feet\\" and the fantastic \\"Sugar Coated\\". The CD is also enhanced with the \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" video, and a short documentary about the making of it.<br /><br />This is a great double-disk to have in your collection. \\"Back To Bedlam\\" is an outstanding debut album, and it will be interesting to follow James Blunt's career from this point on.
B000002UA0|5.0|i just want to start off by saying syd barrett is one of my favorite artists of all time and i have this album to thank him for that. though the album is nothing like what most pink floyd fans would come to expect(dsom, the wall, meddle, etc.) piper displays the beginning building blocks it took for the band to progress(as well as saucerful of secrets; the only song featuring barrett in sos is the last track; jugband blues)<br /><br />but this is an album that shouldnt be praised just because its a pink floyd album, it should have the respect it deserves for being one of the most influential psychadelic albums of the sixties to now. its also in my opinion, one of the most underrated albums, even people who claim to be the biggest of floyd fans have never heard it, so if your of the latter, even if your not and just looking fr a new opening in music, then you best give this a shot. barrett is one of the most unique & artistic songwriters of his generation and it shines unbelievably through this album<br /><br />im sure im not the only one who has wondered what could have been if barrett hadnt gone through his meltdown and was still a member of the band, something truly amazing and beyond may have transpired, but im still proud of the direction floyd has gone in the past.<br /><br />my friend once said that this album is like \\"listening to the beatles on acid\\" as mediocre as that might sound at first, its actually quite true (minus the pop feel)<br /><br />also if you listen to this and take an unsurprising liking to syd barrett, than i recommend picking up his 1st solo album \\"the madcap laughs\\" another underrated gem from the golden age of music.
B000J3EEBY|3.0|There are some good tracks on this CD, but there are also some less than good ones.  All and all it doesn't have the soul of her previous recordings.  Loreena's voice remains good, but you don't feel the haunting, spiritual quality that made her earlier work far above average.  As someone else mentioned, your first impression will be disappointing because you're given a folded cardboard wrapped around a CD.  Everything about Loreena's new offering falls just short of her usual perfection. You may find you are not amused (sorry, couldn't resist).<br /><br />Try to listen to this recording before you buy it.
B000EJ9VUW|5.0|the first liars album i heard was \\"they were wrong so we drowned\\". i fell in love with it as well as the band. the subversive style was very tripped out and the melodies were pure magic. this album, while still, actually even more trippy than the precious album, is bliss.<br /><br />the first three tracks alone blend together so wonderfully it could be one song.it is very different from their first \\"they threw us all in a trench and stuck a monument on top\\" and definately the band's most abstract album yet, but imo that is what is so great about it. it is such a great space out album, perfect for listening to on headphones at 3 in the morning when you cant get sleep.<br /><br />i guess i can see why people or fans of their previous work wouldn't like this cd, but i dont really care because i probably dont share the same music interest with them anyway, \\"one man's trash is another man's treasure\\", right?<br /><br />i still strongly recommend it, especially if your into music that has sex with your brain.
B000J10ERO|1.0|Lousy dialogue, lousy chemistry, no humour, ridiculous situations. Nice special effects, and Brandon's performance is actually good. But it seems like the screenwriters had no feel for any of the characters, there is very little mystery, and no real surprises. You feel like they just wanted to walk some cardboard cutouts of Superman, Lois Lane and Lex Luthor through dangerous situations without worrying about how they would really feel and react.
B000I0QK74|3.0|I loved \\"Who comes this night\\", which was a new song to me, as well as James' arrangements of \\"Go tell it on the mountain\\" and \\"In the bleak midwinter\\". The honorary Scot in me also appreciated hearing some of the more obscure verses of the Bobbie Burn's classic, \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", though I could have done without the tweaking there, particularly the anglicizing of the lyrics.  <br /> <br />Overall, many of the songs sounded too similar to me and I failed to appreciate the jazz take on many of the tracks. Personal preference as much as anything. As can be seen from other reveiws, others may appreciate these arrangements more than I.  <br /> <br />All in all, the album is worth its price for the 2nd and 10th trcks alone. Now if only I can find the sheet music for those without having to buy a couple of $20 compilations...
B000JJS8TM|5.0|LOVE, totally amazing, it's truly exiting to listen to, I quite literally can't believe my ears! <br /> <br />As stated in the cd's booklet, this was originally conceived of by George Harrison and Guy Lalibere for Cirque du Soleil. George Martin and his son Giles remixed a couple dozen songs for the show and it has now been put it out as an album. It's absolutely incredible, like listening to a totally new album. Song after song comes out with an energy and brilliance that doesn't quit all the way through. <br /> <br />I've been a Beatles fan since I was a baby, as my older brothers had their albums and I had the opportunity to grow up listening to them since I was born, and I've never heard their music like this before. Imagine listening to Sgt Pepper for the first time and you get the idea. The crispness of the instruments is startling, esspecially Revolution, which actually made me shout \\"WOW!\\" when I heard the distortion with clarity. <br /> <br />George Martin is an absolute genius and if there was ever any doubt before who the fifth Beatle was, there can be none any longer! Not that there ever was, but now it's written in stone. <br />It sounds so good and so fresh that I was completely blown away. You have to hear it to understand, the way they mixed the songs completely catches you by surprise, even with the song line-up in front of you. I kept wondering how they were going to transition from early songs to later ones and back, yet every time, it seemed completely natural, as if that's how it was meant to be. <br /> <br />If you consider that I have had dozens of bootlegs of Beatles music over the years, heard most of the material released on the Anthology albums years before it was officially available, and even made several mixes of their music for my own listening pleasure, you may realize that I am not just some off the wall, crazed Beatle fan who is happy to hear something new. In fact, it's not new, just the way it's mixed and presented is new. But itis done with such imagination, such creativity and expertise, I can't say enough about it. George Martin did add one thing that was not from the original Beatle recordings, he scored the acoustic version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", from Anthology, with a nice string arrangement that sounds like it could just have easily been done in 1968 had they chosen to use that version for the White Album. As a life-long, die-hard Beatles fan, I can honestly say that there isn't one second of this creation that offended me. The Beatles were the original experimentors in rock music and George Martin was responsible for a great deal of it. Just read a few books about the recording sessions and you will realize that there is nothing unusual about what has been done on this cd, except that we now have the technology to realize our dreams. Think back to what Martin did to create the original version of \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and it all follows suit. In fact, he did it again with the new mix of that very same sone, editing it with take 1 and combining them just as flawlessly as the original, but in a different spot. It goes on to include other song snippits, while maintaining the drum track and fits perfectly with \\"Hello Goodbye\\". Listen to the background of \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\"; it knocked my socks off!  <br /> <br />I wonder if those who have never heard most of the Beatles music will be able to appreciate just how different and refreshing it is to hear this mix is. I wonder if they will understand how much work had to be done, how meticulous the Martins had to be to get it the way it is. There is no question in my mind that the Martins will share the Producer of the Year award and this album will be at the very least nominated for album of the year, and it should win, though I have to admit I am not up on all the new albums these days. But knowing what I know, and having heard all of these songs many times over and over in my life, this cannot simply be written off as another \\"Best Of\\" collection of Beatles songs. It is completely different, completely new and one of the most enjoyable music listening experiences in many years. It is a magnificent work of art! <br /> <br />JJ
B000F0UUT6|4.0|In one review \\"a viewer\\" says the sound is tinny on the DVD. Curious, I compared the sound on both the taped and the DVD (both the Special Edition and the 10th Anniversary Collector's Set). Neither I nor my lady friend noticed any sound problem and we're very picky about such details.    We did see the same bluer color tone as \\"a viewer\\" on the DVDs, however. My friend (a professional photographer) changed the COLOR TEMPERATURE from HIGH to 5700K (a warmer tone). She also changed COLOR (saturation) from 50% to 75%. This fixed the problem to our satisfaction. After seeing the movie, we had to change the color back. This is not a flaw we care about, especially since it takes just a few button pushes. While we'll watch the DVD version again (and again) it's unlikely we'll do it more than once a year!    The color flaw is a small price to pay for what we got on the 10th anniversary Collector's Set. Since all that is well described elsewhere, I'll only mention one item I especially loved - the 120-page beautiful color-illustrated MAKING OF book. The interview with Colin Firth is fascinating. So was the decription of how the screenwriter Andrew Davies handled the various problems of adapting the book, such as how he made the numerous essential letters visual.    I also own the Keira Knightley version of P&P. I like it equally well, for different reasons. Buy both is my advice!    Laer Carroll
B000E97HIA|4.0|Finally! A Prince album you can get into! Not the rambling acid-jazz joints or the self-indulgent preachy gospel sermons he's been turning out past several years. I must admit I've been a little jaded and cynical from his less than sterling recent efforts but WHAT A COMEBACK! How many of you remember way back in '85 performing live on stage in Syracuse, when he turned his back to the audience and looked up to the heavens and said: \\"But they dig it when i'm BAD...!\\" I'm glad he's finally come to his senses. Yes your purple highness, we loyal subjects LOVE it when you're bad! This ain't Church, it's Showbiz! Its refreshing to see the Artist having SOo much fun again! And it shows in his music. Take BLACK SWEAT, it's cool sexy funk. Quintessential Prince. A true genius with STYLE! Guess we have Tamara to thank, huh? In any case, WELCOME BACK PRINCE! We missed you!
B000J103X4|5.0|i bought this album a week ago out of curiosity after all the controversial mixtapes/diss sessions between him and a lot many rappers.first of all, my expectation was that it would be a little bit worse than his debut album.Surprisingly, I liked this album better than the first one.There's almost no bad song on it and at least 5 real hits. I don't know which one to pick for his next single.The last track is over 9 minutes long with a wonderful vocal.Even without Dre's artistic touch, I think The Game picked the best producers and was able to achieve a good result.While I don't like his cocky attitude,he is young and he will mature over time. But, the thing is he remains as the young flagship of West Coast' revival. <br /> <br />Favorite Tracks: <br /> <br />+ Wouldn't Get Far <br />+ One Night <br />+ California Vacation <br />+ Lookin' At You <br />+ Let's Ride <br />+ Around The World <br />+ Why You Hate The Game <br />+ Too Much
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Great show, disc two is the best, with all of Dark Side Of The Moon and a great version of Comfortably Numb.  David Gilmour is simply one of the all time great guitarists.  The stage and lighting for this show are simply spectacular!  The image quality is very good, considering it was originally filmed on video.  The sound is excellent, I dont have a 5.1 Surround system, but it sounds awesome in plain old stereo.  Yes, I could nitpick about some things, the tempos are rushed on some of the old tunes and the extra percussionist guy is a little annoying. Overall though, all the tunes are very well done. <br /> <br />Lots of cool extras, like the ability to watch the screen films by themselves.   <br /> <br />If you will bear with me I am going to address the age old argument about whether this is really Pink Floyd, without Roger Waters on stage.  It is true that Waters wrote all the great lyrics and came up with the concepts.  However, the classic \\"Pink Floyd sound\\" has little to do with Waters.  It is David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason.  Here is a direct quote from Waters in Musician magazine in 1992: \\"I was never a bass player. I've never played anything. I play guitar a bit on the records and would play bass, because I sometimes want to hear the \\"sound\\" I make when I hit a string on a bass with a pick or my finger; it makes a different sound than anybody else makes, to me. But I've never been interested in playing the bass. I'm not interested in playing instruments and I never have been...\\"  In fact, Gilmour played bass on a lot of the studio recordings (One Of These Days, Pigs, to mention a few)!  So there you have it folks.  Yes, this IS Pink Floyd playing Pink Floyd music, with lyrics by Roger Waters.  Give Roger his due, but it is absolute rubbish to say that these guys are not Floyd witout Waters. End of rant. <br /> <br />If you like Pink Floyd, you will love this DVD.  If you are not a fan, you will be after watching this. Buy it!
0441009425|1.0|I had chosen to listen to the good reviews about this book because I am, after all, a science fiction fan. I bought it with high hopes and what did I get? If you've watched \\"Star Trek IV\\" (And one of the Star Trek: TOS\\" episodes, can't remember the name of it offhand,) and a number of other sci-fi books, stories and movies, you've seen this plot before. Granted, the author spins this grandiose web of a backstory around the plot which, in my opinion, was a colossal waste of time. Another reviewer here stated another glaring truth: I cared not one bit about any of the \\"characters\\" in this novel. I had high hopes that it would be a story in the scope of \\"The Night's Dawn Trilogy\\" by Peter Hamilton but it doesn't even come close (and a lot of people didn't like that one because of it's ending. I thought it was fantastic.)<br /><br />The author borrows heavily from several different sources. I didn't find any original ideas in this book. All in all a huge disappointment. Don't waste your money or your time.
0800177177|4.0|Although this movie retained the novel's original cast of characters and basic plot points it is a gross mischaracterization to name this movie \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\". The backbone, heart and soul of this movie is the love story between Dracula and Mina - a story arc that is nowhere to be found in the novel. Even so I enjoyed the movie very much. Turning Dracula into a tragic figure does tend to lessen the horror and totally change the tone/story of the novel but it is a change that translates well to film.   <br /> <br />I knocked off a star for the needless mysoginy which I resented. I realize many male directors love to throw female nudity into any movie with violence (the sexist and irresponisble social implications of that statement are better suited for another forum) but that doesn't make it right artistically. Turning Lucy's character into a sexually charged hornball gave Copella a reason to repeatedly show her breasts but it also made her character infintely less sympathic when her story turns tragic. There was no need to make the vampire women topless, nor was there a legitimate artistic basis for the freaky beastiality scene with Dracula's incarnation of a warewolf and Lucy. It was exploitive and transparent and I expect better from respected directors. <br /> <br />I should knock off another star for Keanu Reeves' english accent which was more tragic and disturbing than anything a vampire is capable of. Winona Ryder was a mess too. Gary Oldman's great performance as Dracula (young and old) mitigated the damage however. I also enjoyed the movie's creation of Dracula's back story which was entertaining and something I wish had been included in the novel. <br /> <br />In spite of the criticisms noted I enjoyed the movie very much and would recommend it.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|As much as I enjoyed A Crow Left of the Murder, it left me wanting more.  Incubus had previously released three classic albums, and Crow just didn't meet the extremely high standards I had built for it. <br /> <br />Light Grenades is a great CD because (like all of their other albums) they tried something new, but they have a bit more to cater towards the hardcore fans who keep whining about Make Yourself and S.C.I.E.N.C.E. <br /> <br />High Points: <br />Anna Molly is the most fun song on the album <br />Pink Floyd type intro is different and welcomed <br />More experimentation but throws in some of the old for good taste <br />Flows well <br />Good variety; you can rock out or you can sing along <br />None of the funk <br /> <br />Low Points: <br />None of the funk <br />A couple of fillers, mainly the Earth to Bellas <br />Brandon's voice seems a bit different, not always for the good <br />DJ Kilmore seems underutilized <br /> <br />My Picks: <br />Anna Molly, Dig, Pendulous Threads, Rogues
B00008973Q|3.0|This film is about an aging lord named Hidetora, who decides to give his three sons parts of his kingdom. The oldest two sons, Jiro and Taro are happy with the decision. Saburo on the other hand isn't not and he suggests that his father is crazy and ends up banished by his father. Saburo ultimately ends up being right in the end and this leads the viewer to actually believe that Hidetora is actually crazy. Although everyone in the movie good, bad or ugly eventually sucumbs to death the director got the message across. The movie was good but long like 4 hours long, could have been much much shorter, I give it a C.
0385486804|5.0|An adventurous boy gives up everything he has, including his education to embark in an epic adventure.  He gets rid of all his possessions to travel across the country, hitch hiking from one city to the other.  Along the way he meets wonderful people who find him an interesting kid, changing their lives and touching their harts.  He finds his way and head for Alaska only to enter the wild and the wilderness, what happened to him next changes his life for ever. \\"Into the Wild\\" is a great book to read if you are interested in the outdoors and the wild.  It's fully packed with life changing situations.  This book is by the far most interesting book I have ever read.....
B000E6GBV2|3.0|Great service and fast. Album did not meet my expectations; but not the fault of the seller.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I love Sarah McLachlan and I found that her X-Mas CD was fabulous.  It has a good mix of songs you recognize, with a few thrown in that you may not.   <br /> <br />Sarah has a unique sound...it carries over so well into her X-mas music. If you like her other CD's, you'll love the X-mas album.  If you don't care for her other music (what's wrong with you!), then sadly I doubt you'll like this CD. <br /> <br />My favorite on the CD has to be \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\".  It is just a beautiful track. <br /> <br />I don't own a lot of X-Mas CDs...but I am certainly happy with the purchase of this CD and I would suggest it to anyone.
0307237699|4.0|In most democracies, whenever politicians bid their time, suspicious electorates watch with apprehension. When they write, readers peruse with caution. These defensive impulses are natural; so as not to be consumed by the fanciful fireworks, which only serve to overshadow a hidden agenda. But, Barack Obama is different. He thrives on a superior realm: diligent, down-to-earth, and true to his word. He is one man who remains tenaciously honest: even to his own political disadvantage. Such men are worth their weights in gold. They are what our contemporary America longs for. But they are rare!<br />  With engaging narrations and indepth analyses, \\"The Audacity of Hope...\\" presents a logical and convincing discourse on how the U.S.A. could go about reinventing itself. This book did a good job in uncovering the delicate truths regarding how to go about learning from past mistakes and making amendments. It relentlessly highlighted how best both good ideas and their masterminds could be resourced for the benefit of the American society. Anyone who reads it would agree that it is devoid of any self-serving political interest. Rather, it is a fountain of knowledge and wisdom. Very frank! Most honorable!! And very educative!!!<br />This book brims with patriotic vision. It is commendable; and truly imbibes all the essential know-how required for the goal of 'Reclaiming the American Dream'. Another brilliant exploit from the esteemed Illinois Senator!
0895260131|5.0|This is one of the most important books of our time. You should really read it together with another book, THE FORCE OF REASON by the world-famous journalist Oriana Fallaci, which has been called the most important book for the last 100 years. These books are so important for the Western civilization that EVERYONE living in the West should read it before it is too late. You should buy at least 100 copies for your friends, family members and colleagues, or anyone you know or don't know. The Western civilization depends on these books and depends on the people who read them.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I'm not going to go in to the differences between this version of the film and the version we're all familiar with.  But let me say that Richard Donner's version is WAY better than the original release.  It feels so much more like a sequel to the first film.  Donner's version is much darker and much more serious.  I liked this version a lot more than the original release.
B000JBXXZ4|2.0|I've been a fan of Incubus for a long time and have listened to every single one of their albums multiple times. Not only is the instrumentation fantastic on their albums, but Boyd's vocal abilities were jaw-droppingly perfect and precise. <br /> <br />This album was very disappointing. You might like it if you liked A Crow Left of the Murder (which I didn't), as the whole album has a very toned-down, cookie-cutter feeling to it. Dig, the third track, sounds like a Christian soft rock song. None of the songs on this album stood out to me and it was pretty embarassing to listen to. Boyd's voice sounds completely different from when the band began- the transition has been noticeable, especially with A Crow, but in this album there's no individuality or beauty to it. His voice sounds very bland and very studio-cleaned. <br /> <br />The lyrics are the worst part, as lyrics are what made me love Incubus in the first place. Boyd has always had a gift with words, but for this album it's a bunch of poorly-written emo songs about heartbreak. If you like the kind of music they play on the radio, give this album a listen before you buy it- you might like it. Otherwise, if you're a vintage Incubus fan, avoid at all costs.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|Thirty years after its initial release, the third version of \\"A Star Is Born\\" finally comes to DVD in a package that should please the most devoted fans of Barbra Streisand. That would include me since I just saw her in concert singing among other numbers, the feminist anthem \\"Woman in the Moon\\" from this 1976 film. Easy to dismiss, the movie's career-polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of Hollywood-style clich&eacute;s that variations of it exist in other films including Streisand's own \\"Funny Girl\\". This time reset to the then-contemporary music scene, the timeworn plot follows self-destructive rock star John Norman Howard on his deep-dive career descent just as he meets club singer Esther Hoffman who is awaiting her big break.<br /><br />Troubles dog their courtship from the outset, as John Norman (both names please) responds to grasping fans and bloodless DJs with random acts of violence (from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution). To John Norman, Esther represents his last shot at happiness, and in turn, she is drawn to the innately decent, creative musician underneath the façade. In the movie's most pivotal scene, he gives Esther her big break at a benefit concert, and her career takes off. Inevitably, he can't handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success, and if you are familiar with any version of this story, you know the rest. Directed by Frank Pierson (although Streisand's budding directorial talents are obviously on display), the film still manages to draw me in, even though I know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative. It still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws.<br /><br />Although Streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star, her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play Esther credibly. The same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer Adult Contemporary-oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock. From the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the Oreos, she can't help but come across as an established star. I can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent, but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes Esther more strident than poignant when John Norman's woes become overwhelming. This creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than Esther's response to it. This is capped off by an uninterrupted eight-minute close-up of her memorial performance - great except when she regrettably mimics John Norman's style toward the end.<br /><br />Kristofferson, on the other hand, gives a superb performance throughout, managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love, pride and resentment toward Esther. He makes his vodka-soaked onstage growling work within this context. Otherwise, what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn't exist unless they were interacting with the two principals. The only ones who register are Paul Mazursky as John Norman's level-headed manager Brian and Gary Busey as his cynical band manager Bobbie. Veteran cameraman Robert Surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print. A big seller in its day, the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970's - some songs still quite good (\\"Everything\\", \\"Woman in the Moon\\", \\"Watch Closely Now\\"), some that have moved to kitsch (\\"Queen Bee\\", Kenny Loggins' \\"I Believe in Love\\") and of course, the inescapable \\"Evergreen\\".<br /><br />The print transfer on the 2006 DVD is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering. Streisand's participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature-length commentary. She gives insightful information about the genesis of the film, the casting and the reportedly troubled production. She is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of Jon Peters, her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie's producer, and her dissatisfaction with Pierson as a director. I just wish she could have provided more scene-specific comments that directly relate to what is onscreen. She also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her, e.g., it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of Peters. I think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her.<br /><br />There is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970's clothes, especially Kristofferson's mixed-fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt. There are also twelve deleted scenes included with Streisand's optional commentary. One is a comic bread-baking scene which reminded me how much I like Streisand in farcical comedies. Another is an extended scene in which she plays \\"Evergreen\\" on the guitar in front of an awestruck Kristofferson who then falls asleep. The most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts, which I agree with Streisand should have been used. Fittingly, the theatrical trailers for all three versions of \\"A Star Is Born\\" are also included.about the genesis of the film, the casting and the reportedly troubled production.

B000H5V8DG|4.0|The set is cool, great design and all, but it seems they were in a rush packing the dvd's.  The first holder (like a paper booklet) is thorn on my set, like if someone opened way too much.  Lucky me, I only got one scratched dvd, but still plays fine.  I think the idea was bright but the holders are totally disapointing.  Except that, I love my Rambaldi box.  I think the deal was great, if only the holder was not thorn and the dvds were better protected, it would have been perfect!!!
B000J10ERO|5.0|I've been looking forward to a remake of America's greatest hero ever since the first Spiderman movie came out.  A movie where the effects could do justice to the grandeur of Superman's abilities.  Singer's effort did not disappoint.  The effects were jaw-dropping, not the least of which is the infamous airplane scene. <br /> <br />The score was incredible as well, complete with a liberal sprinkling of strains from the John Williams original.  The film did an outstanding job of ringing in themes and storylines from the past, all while breathing new life into a superhero that has been overtaken in recent years by Spiderman and Batman.   <br /> <br />On the acting front, Brandon Routh does a good job as the intentional Reeves-lookalike.  Kate Bosworth is equally up to the task of filling Lois Lane's shoes.  Kevin Spacey gave us a different (slightly more maniacal) Lex Luthor, but what do you expect after all that time in prison?  Casting and acting were well done, although no one jumped out as an astounding performance.   <br /> <br />A must-watch for any Superman fan, particularly those who felt jilted by Superman IV...
B000H7JCG4|3.0|First of all, I was ecstatic after hearing about the Beverly Hills 90210 series coming to DVD. This was by far my favourite show on television growing up, and I am still thrilled to watch upcoming seasons. But one thing that has been bothering me after watching episode after episode, is the difference in music. I noticed it right away - as i was an avid watcher of the program and even taped episodes on VHS to watch over again for my own personal use. Now i know why it took so long to get this program out on DVD - and I am quite disappointed how the producers/creators could not satisfy the artists' requests to use their music for the DVD's. I am now on the episode where the girls have a slumber party at Brenda's house - and the song missing is \\"Monie Monie\\". When they are all \\"supposed to be\\" singing it - you feel such a lack of coordination. And this is not the only situation.....there are DOZENS MORE. The music is an integral part of the show - and I certainly hope this issue gets settled for the second season, cause i would HATE to see REM's Losing My Religion gone or the fun music from the Peach Pit...watching the DVD's is just not the same as the original program :(
B00005M91K|4.0|This is a really cool movie. It has excellent music and is interesting to just relax and watch some random stuff. The music is good for background music. It can also be used as background image/music for a gathering/party.
B000J10ERO|3.0|I rented this movie and was very surprised to find out that superman did not get the opportunity to fight anything remotely close to his level of powers. It's not very entertaining to watch a long movie about superman vs. a rich man. Lex Luthur is a good bad guy but in the entire movie did not contain any battle scenes. A few beat-em-ups but no real battles which is what I personally wanted to see. Am I wrong for wanting action in my action movie?
B000IHY9UW|5.0|Actually, the Doors was Jim Morrison and some other guys.  Oh sure, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore contributed to the music and the sound, no doubt, but without Morrison the Doors would have been a long forgotten L.A. band.  Or do you rate \\"Other Voices\\" and \\"Full Circle\\" as classics?  Yeah, I didn't think so.<br /><br />Now that we have that settled, this imperfect movie rates the 5 on the relatively soft Amazon scale for one huge reason, the spot-on near clone performance of Val Kilmer, surely the role of his life so far.  I can recall few, if any, portrayals that are a closer match to the real person.  The face, the expressions, the movements and that voice . . . wow.  The scene in the Whiskey, fading in through the indian's eye, it's one of the best things put on film, ever.  The movie isn't great, it moves too fast and leaves a lot out, but there are great things in it.<br /><br />I also liked the way the movie paid homage to the Morrison mythos too; was he really possessed?  Did they raise Dionysus in concert?  Could he really recite from memory obscure books found only in the library of Congress?  Well, maybe not, but there was something spiritual about Morrison, the man was one of those \\"great souls\\" whose personality dominated all around him.  He had a certain amount of art in him, all written in his poetry book before they even started, and when it was done, he was done, and he was gone, probably still wearing the same shoes and pants.  His life, though tragic, was pure rock and roll.  Everyone dies.  Morrison lived like a skyrocket.  The movie is a fitting tribute, with no holds barred.<br /><br />By the way, the original version of this movie carried one last line of print before the credits, in case you're curious.  Her family managed to get it removed, but it said \\"Pam joined him three years later . . .\\".<br /><br />PS:  What's the \\"Soldier Blue\\" DVD picture doing here?  (a/o 12-06-06).
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I totally love this Beatles mix; especially in the DVD-Audio Format! Wow! <br /> <br />I had high expectations and they have been exceeded. This is not just a carelessly thrown together bunch of bits and pieces. It is expertly mixed and the sound quality is superb. It is hard to imagine anyone doing it any better than this. <br /> <br />This is an absolute MUST-HAVE for all Beatles fans! Gotta LOVE it!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I show my biases and a broad generation gap in saying that I listened to this recording three times before developing an appreciation for Sarah McLachlan - I had not heard her music before - although local radio stations play Sarah's tracks often, according to my more-up-to-date wife.  I bought the CD through Amazon as a concession to something other than traditional carols, having always enjoyed Yoko and Johnny's \\"Happy Xmas (War is Over),\\" as well as \\"Christmastime is Here\\" by Vince Guaraldi and Lee Mendelson, in addition to the more traditional \\"In The Bleak Mid-Winter.\\"  In my opinion, the song selection - a seamless blend of contemporary songs with old standards and traditional carols -- is the strength of this very personal Christmas songbook.    Ms. McLachlan's Christmas messages of joy and sadness are timely, appropriate - reflecting the mixed views of our presently troubled nation.  Joni Mitchell's \\"River,\\" Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Song For A Winter Night,\\" and the artist's own \\"Wintersong\\" are present-day complements to songs of an earlier generation -- \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" (I still remember the tears in Mom's eyes every time Bing Crosby crooned the song during WW II)  and Judy Garland's \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" (by Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin, from the film \\"Meet Me In St. Louis,\\") -- and the traditional carols, \\"O Little Town Of Bethlehem, The First Noel / Mary, Mary (and) Silent Night.\\"      However, my personal favorite is \\"What Child Is This? (Greensleeves)\\" - respectively, William Chatterton Dix's 1865 lyrics coupled with a traditional English folk tune -- a haunting and unforgettable lullaby of new Mother with Child, refugees in a Middle East land, ravaged by war and occupied by a military superpower.    Time passing will tell us if this CD is equal to or better than Patty Loveless' \\"Blue Grass & White Snow, A Mountain Christmas,\\" or Mariah Carey's \\"Merry Christmas\\" -- two Christmas albums of considerable merit I reviewed earlier.  In the meantime, \\"Wintersong\\" deserves an honored place in everyone's music collection.
B000INAXGU|5.0|I dare you to throw this CD on and not move.  The pure funkiness on this album is so pervasive that you'll be gettin' down with it in no time.      Jamiroquai has been around for a long time!  And I was surprised by how many of the songs were semi-popular.  They've been consistently good for quite awhile, which is hard for a group to do.    You could argue that buying the individual albums is better, but that gets expensive.  You could also argue that some of their best songs are missing (Mr. Moon, one of my favorites, is missing).  But for a compilation, this is about as good as it gets.    Plus, the two new songs on here, at the end, fit in perfectly.  They are just as good and funky as the others.  Jamiroquai (Jay Kay) write great catchy songs with catchy choruses.  Somehow they never get cheesey though.      I don't like giving 5-star reviews normally, but this one warrants one.  The entire album is consistently enjoyable and danceable.  This is top-notch funky white-boy disco soul!  Highly recommended.
B000J103WK|5.0|After reading the first two customer reviews I was a little worried (had allready ordered before any customer reviews).  But after receiving the HD-DVD and placing in my newly arrived 360 HD-DVD I have had no problems.  Picture and sound are fantastic!  I believe the latest update from Microsoft for the player solved the issues!
0920668372|1.0|My mom is a retired preschool teacher. When I had my son, she told me about this book, and how all her preschool moms raved about it. So I ordered it. If it weren't for the shipping fees, I'd send it back. I understand and appreciate the premise; I wish my little guy weren't growing up so fast. But I don't need a bedtime story to remind me that I'll get old someday, or make me wonder if I'm loving my son enough now to make him want to take care of me when the time comes. Depressing.
B000002N2N|5.0|This is indeed the Ramones at their best. It's their best songs, from their first 3 albums, but much better sound than on those 3 studio albums. Plus you get to hear the energy of the Ramones live without the ensuing days of deafness I experienced a quarter century ago. If I had to just have one Ramones CD, this would be it.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|See it for your self - this Brilliant Restoration (Best Racing Movie Period) - no other movie captures cockpit detail, authentic sound and great camera work. <br /> <br />The colors are again vivid and makes the movie look much more recent. <br />This movie has the biggest names (real racing drivers in the back drop) of the day. <br /> <br />If you like the old race cars this is a hands down a winner. <br />
1400044162|5.0|Often, with novels like this one, you get a better feeling for the history of a time or event than you get from reading an actual history. History is often too bland, this army did that, so many were killed - but you can't feel for them, they really aren't people.  <br /> <br />In this book the people are African, tribal, the background of the story was the revolt in Nigeria that attempted to set up the Republic of Biafra. The title of the story comes from the Biafran flag that contained such an image. Perhaps the details of the Bifran story don't really matter. This could well have been the situation in oh so many African countries in the years since, indeed including the current one in the Darfur region of western Sudan.  <br /> <br />The story is told from the standpoint of three people caught up in the struggle. You can understand what is happening to three people. You really can comprehend what happened to the estimated million people in Biafra.  <br /> <br />As I read this I found myself wondering about the situations in other African countries where problems of this type seem to just be getting started: Zimbabwe for instance, or South Africa where some black politicians are beginning to blame the whites for everything from unemployment to AIDS.  <br /> <br />I wonder why somebody hasn't done something. I wonder if anybody could do anything.
B000J3EEBY|3.0|I was very excited to receive this, being another LMcK fan that's been waiting 10 long years. I enjoy this recording, especially at sunset, but I agree with some other reviewers that it lacks something. All the songs are slow, and seemingly weave into one another so that the entire CD seems to be one song. The only break comes from \\"Beneath a Phrygian Sky\\", which oddly echoes the \\"Bonny Swans\\". There are other references to M&M throughout. It's beautiful, yes, but it doesn't really take flight. PS: I also love her adaptations of poems like \\"The Highwayman\\" and her renditions of Shakespeare, but here it is mostly all her own words. I think Qntal has taken over in the \\"adapting famous poems\\" department (ie: Ozymandias).
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I always find the opinions of true music fans an interesting read and it was fun to read all the impressions submitted.  So--here is my 2 cents.  I was interested in hearing the beatles in 5.1(which I think is the way recorded music was meant to be heard)but I entered cautiously--this is the Beatles--be careful--don't screw this up.  Well...all I could do was smile as it went from song to song.  Simply amazing and it reminds us how great the Beatles were.  The range-how many new musical ideas they introduced us to--there will never again be anyone or any collection of music that will have this type of impact on the world of music--never!  (this is coming from someone who is not a Beatles fanatic)The Martin boys did an amazing job with the new mix.  I hope they are considering to go 5.1 with the whole catalog--hopefully Mr Martin will steer the project.  I don't think anyone else could have pulled this off. Don't you think if the Beatles were around today they would be recording in 5.1??Please..listen to this in 5.1.  Listen--smile--remember--sing along.  It doesn't get any better than this.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Truly, this boxset does the greatest show of my time, Alias, justice.  It is extremely cool, awesomely thought out, and well executed.  BVHE could have thrown together anything and sold all five seasons for the same price, but instead they took the time to make sure this boxset would be worthy of Alias.  THIS IS A MUST-BUY for anyone who loves great TV!!
B000J103N4|5.0|This is right up there with Sgt. Pepper and Dark Side of the Moon as far as being a great Trip album.  You have to listen to it all in one sitting. <br />Crosby backed by Nash and Young and most of the Airplane and Dead! <br />It is a great listening experience, but don't expect much in the sense of conventional songs.   <br />On the technical side, the DVD-Audio is incredible!  The Dolby soundtracks are OK, but the DVD-Audio is the one to go for.  As posted in the discussion forums, unlike \\"Voyage\\", the cd is not detected as an HDCD by my player.  Could it be a regular cd mislabeled as an HDCD?  \\"Voyage\\" does play as a HDCD.
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|Incubus' last effort (A Crow Left of The Murder) appeared to mark a turning point for the band, finally departing from their mainstream hits (Morning View) and misses (Make Yourself), and experimenting again.  Which is why I can't help but feel let down by the long anticipated follow up, Light Grenades.  While it does pack quite a punch, showcasing a more abrasive, messy, lo-fi side of the band, it feels a little too one dimensional for an Incubus album. <br /> <br />The biggest mis-step is in Brandon's lyrics, that pretty much turn this into a break up album.  I've always enjoyed Brandon's creative analogies and sly jabs, but when it comes to relationships, it's like high school poetry.  The band does all it can to energize the lyrics.  Sometimes they succeed (Saving \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off\\" from reading like a Fall Out Boy b-side), but can't save the eye-rollingly bad \\"Love Hurts\\".   <br /> <br />Cancel out that song and the mid-album filler (Oil, Water, Diamonds, And Coal), then combine the songs that were obviously seperated to make the album an LP (Quicksand+ Kiss and the two \\"Bella\\" tracks), and you've got a half hour and 8 tracks.  Which makes me wonder why two songs were cut from the album (left in for Japan) and why not give us the 3 or 4 hard to find songs recorded in the past 2 years? <br /> <br />Still it's a half hour of solid rock music on this album, and I've grown up on punk so it makes no difference to me.  \\"Anna Molly\\" is hands down, the band's best single ever.  \\"Light Grenades\\" while lyrically not a representative of this album at all, is the band's most explosive song ever (yes, more than anything on SCIENCE).  \\"Paper Shoes\\" appears to be the only track that evolved from ACLOTM, really strecthing its legs and using the entire band. <br /> <br />All in all, I commend the band for redefining their sound yet again.  It's excititing to hear the band at lightspeed again.  The album just has too much mainstream rust on it at times, and quite frankly, not enough tunes.  I hope Incubus gives us one last crazy sonic mind-trip of an album before shutting down.
0321213351|3.0|I have read this book after reading Design Pattern and Refactoring. I found Chapter 1 - 3 are fantastic. But one drawback of the examples is the author used XML extensively in the book. Since XML is no longer glorious and still not so popular, using it as the example made the readers lost in translation. Unlike him, Martin used common domain knowledge in his books so people can capture the concepts easily.<br /><br />I don't think Peter's one star is fair for the author, since Joshua gave a lot of insights in this book so it still worths reading. I commented his review. I have read this book again and my opinion didn't change.<br /><br />I found one way to judge a book is to use Amazon used book price. This book is $19.97 as of today while Martin's Refactoring is $38.50(there is a paperback International Edition as $29.99 which doesn't count). It reflects the value of the book.
B000E5KUK6|1.0|This is an absurd production. Calling this creature Godzilla. Is like having Michael Myers appear without the Captain Kirk Mask. Or having Jason wear a catchers mask or Freddy wear a boxing glove. Its like having Batman with no utility belt, Spiderman with no web shooters or Superman in a purple tutu. Its like cuttung the space ships out of Star wars and replacing them with computer generated ones. Its like casting Samuel L. Jackson as James Bond. ITS A SHAM.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|This is awesome. The first three Kiss classic live albums, plus the never-before-released Millennium show. Each recording is on a single disc (without editing the songs down from the original recordings), the original artwork is reproduced fully and faithfully for each recording, the full booklets for each recording are included, and there is a bonus track added to Alive II and a bonus track added to Alive III. This is better than owning the recordings individually, and if you already own the original recordings, this is worth having for the new concert. The best.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This is typical of the \\"Sky is Falling\\" mentality of certain individuals in every generation.  The tragedy is,  there is too big of a carbon footprint from people on the planet.  The warming issue while slickly presented here is just basically junk science at this point.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Many superlatives have been said about The Beatles 'final album \\"Abbey Road\\" and there is no doubt that the praise is deserved and that the album is among the Beatles' very best.<br /><br />After the partial uninspired \\"Let it Be\\" sessions the group decided to end their cooperation with a really worthy release.<br /><br />Lennon, who was perhaps the one that was most tired of the role of a Beatle, contributed by two powerful blues-inspired songs \\"Come Together\\" and \\"I Want You\\". On both tracks the group really demonstrates tight competent playing, and this new remastered release is a true pleasure to listen. Espcially the close vocal harmonies and inspired guitar playing by both Lennon and Harrison all over the album.<br /><br />Harrison's two songs on the album both belong among his strongest compositions. \\"Something\\" became a hit single and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is a classic that has been recorded in countless cover-versions.<br /><br />McCartney's \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Oh Darling\\", both fine songs in their own right, have probably also been some of the most criticized. \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" to be silly and a little too \\"old school\\". \\"Oh Darling\\" might seem a bit like an anachronism, with its strong inspiration from old R & B tracks such as \\"Raining in My Heart\\".<br /><br />Ringo's \\"Octopus'Garden\\" appears somewhat as a children's song, but it is actually a nice melody that is both very well arranged and well produced.<br /><br />Lennon appears on the last number before \\"Abbey Road - Suite\\" from his soft side with \\"Because\\", which has some very nice vocal parties.<br /><br />The rest of the album consists mainly of shorter numbers which are inventively more or less tied together. In reality it is probably the \\"Abbey Road - Suite\\", which does that one never really gets tired of this album. The suite includes an abundance of delicate pieces of melody, beautiful vocal harmonies, dazzling instrumental playing and not least, it appears unusually inspired.<br /><br />From \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" to the last stanzas of \\"The End\\" one is so much enthralled by the Beatles. There is no doubt that many groups have been strongly inspired by the way this band were able to bind different genres and melody pieces together into a meaningful whole.<br /><br />Without saying too much, there is probably little doubt that the 10CC and Badfinger (Wish You Were Here) have retrieved much inspiration on this album.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, the new version remastered is true joy to listen to, and the release cannot be recommended too much.t stanzas of \\"The End\\" one is so much enthralled by the Beatles.

B000683VI4|4.0|I thought it was a good movie from the beginning but didn't really understand what was the big deal about it. It was the end that made it for me. Last 10 minutes plus 1 deleted scene put it in a \\"great movies\\" category. Rachel McAdams plays an absolutely beautiful and, which is more important, totally believable character. I didn't like Noah character that much, he seems pretty boring and i don't see how such a girl could have fallen for him, but you never know:) Enjoy and don't watch it when you're sad!
B000AL730O|5.0|\\"Cheos and creation in the backyard\\" is probably the best album released by McCartney in his career. The blend of simple, though powerful lyrics and excelent music, makes this album a \\"must\\" for all McCartney fans and not only. The album is the story of a broken relationship.Paul is lost and realizes that he is about to cross the \\"fine line\\" between chaos(alcohol,drugs) and creation(the wonderful music that we all know about). In the end creation prevails and we get to listen to the story of Paul McCartey and Heather Mill(no other than Jenny Wren). Using his unmistakable talent and imagination, Paul manages to make us feel his anger,sarcasm, pain,regret and thougths of hope, all reflected in sublime songs.This is an unforgetable and unique album by Sir Paul.
B000EMGA3U|5.0|I'm not particularly familiar with Sonic Youth and the bits I've heard from their other albums haven't really grabbed me.  This does.  The rhythm section wouldn't be out of place in pseudo-tribal funk, the guitars are dissonant, jangling, sometimes hypnotically repetitive, and just plain weird, and the vocals are distant, airy, lazy.  Some of the best music I've heard in a good long while.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|This is the Best Movie Ever!  The music is great, the dancing is amazing and the characters are cool.
0783230621|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  I like disaster films anyway.  I think because you feel the struggle to survive throughout the film and there is always HOPE, then, in the end, you feel the rush of good feelings when the hero(s) survive these tremendous odds and \\"win\\".<br /><br />This movie has outstanding visual effects and it builds nicely in intensity.  It reminds you generally of the Mt Saint Helens story.  The storyline involves a volcano that is up in the middle of God's country and erupts in this peaceful, unprepared and unbelieving town.  There's enough added info about seismic detection equipment, pyroclastic blasts, sulphur in the water, etc. that makes you feel like you might be a little smarter after watching the movie.  There is the usual introduction of characters, as typical of a disaster movie, before the xxxx hits the fan.  That way you get to know a little bit about their history and personality.  Once it hits the fan, there is non-stop action.<br /><br />There is also a great mix of personality diversity in the movie, which definitely adds to its flavor.  People like the older grandmother who doesn't want to leave the mountain when its about to blow, to the greedy helicopter pilot, to the overly cautious boss, to the extra cautious volcanologist, and all the people panicking.  There are even 2 kids and a dog, and a lady mayor who runs a coffee shop on the side.  Realistic?  Well, we KNOW that NO ONE would be greedy and capitalize on someone else's misfortune, so maybe the greedy helicopter pilot is a little extreme? :-)  Of course, the hero perseveres through all kinds of unbelievable turmoil.  He just keeps on going.<br /><br />Seriously, the diverse personalities help to add contrast and realism. They keep you on the edge, cheering the good guys, boo-ing the bad guys, and thinking things like \\"Hey, whattsamattah wit you!  Can't you see the mountain is gonna blow!  Get outtah there!--Oh, you dummy!\\"<br /><br />If you like disaster movies, this is a good 'un.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Upon first hearing this record, I found it hard to believe that it came out \\"way back\\" in 1978.  The sound was way ahead of it's time, and the music is as strong today as ever.  Dire Straits self-titled debut features a plethora of styles, many of which defy categorization.  But regardless, the results are unmistakeably Dire Straits.  Mark Knoppfler's lyrics show an amazing sense of maturity and experience, and the songs tell unique stories that often hint at something dark and mysterious.  While \\"Sultans of Swing\\" is a good test of whether you'll enjoy this record, \\"Lions\\", \\"Wild West End\\" and \\"Six Blade Knife\\" each deserve a multitude of credit.  An unquestioned 5 out of 5 stars.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|As a big fan of the originals, I picked up this version immediately and already appreciated many of the ideas Donner had in mind, like using the nuke from the end of part I to free the three villians (not the Paris bomb) and originally using the 'turning back the world' sequence only for the end of part II.  <br /> <br />This version is fascinating to watch as a historical document and as a great lesson of editing and rediting to change the impact of performances.  Unfortunately, there are some better takes used in the Lester version.  This version makes the General Zod and Superman characters less nuanced and more melodramatic.  Compare similiar scenes between Superman and Mother/Father in wanting to renounce his powers for Lois Lane.  There's less urgency in the father/son version. <br /> <br />A definitive version of Superman II would take the best elements of both.   <br />Maybe its better to have Clark Kent give Lois Lane the amnesia superkiss afterall.
B000HIVO64|4.0|Despite keeping the basic musical formula somewhat consistent over the years, Beck still finds ways to release fresh music.  On \\"The Information\\", Beck fans can expect the usual doses of dance beats, gazillions of layered samples, and catchy choruses.  Some tracks will seem very familiar, yet some will be distinctly new.  Beck's typical, unique interpretations of rap music can be found on \\"Cellphone's Dead\\" and \\"1000 bpm\\", while more alternative-friendly numbers like those on Guero come in the form of \\"Nausea\\" and \\"No Complaints\\".  However, there are some newer musical elements never before heard from the infinitely-talented musician.  For example, \\"Soldier Jane\\" contains a Middle-Eastern influence that results in (at least in this reviewer's eyes) one of Beck's greatest musical achievements.  Overall, \\"The Information\\" is a must-own for Beck fans...and definitely check out the accompanying DVD.
B000J103X4|4.0|This album is bangin' despite no Dre or 50 cent. The Game went and got some hot producers to compliment his \\"ride da beat\\" rhymes. This dude took all the bulls**t from his life and smeared it all on this cd. You can really feel where he is coming from. Different topics, not to many guest, tight tracks, and rhymes!!!!<br /><br />This album is a 4.25 or so for me. Mos def go cop this!!!!
B000JK8OYU|4.0|While many people are crying fault, due to the fact that this has to be the thousandth release of a Beatles album in the last decade alone. It actually turned out damn good. <br /> <br />While at first you may feel that you have been burnt at it's initial tracks, but this CD isn't about the individual tracks but, acts as a single entity. Which of course is to be expected considering that it was a \\"cirque du soleil\\" soundtrack.  <br /> <br />Over all I recommend it wholly.
B000002H97|2.0|There are so many debates about where Metallica went sour, or at what point they got better , that sometimes writting a review for this band can seem exhausting. I am sure that all that are reading this are pretty familar with this album, so let me get to my point why I find it a below average album. The year is 1991, and we had waited three years for them to follow up on what I consider to be their break-through album, both musically and lyrically. Let me talk about the \\"...and Justice for all\\" album for a moment. When it was first released, I had some mixed emotions about the album, but as time went on, I felt that it was a hell of an album. Even though I still love \\"Ride the Lightning\\" for its pure heaviness, the ...\\"and Justice\\" album was showing us how much the band had matured since the debut of \\"Kill Em All\\" in 1983. Lars drumming was insane on this album, and sadly he never matched it again. The album was lyrically intelligent, moving into a more diverse range of subjects, and the guitar work was perfect, along with some great bass work by Jason. I almost think of it as a progressive rock/thrash album, and as you can tell by my ramblings, its a pure 5 star effort. SO lets get back to my review of the \\"Black\\" album. After expecting so much from the band after this greatness of \\"..And Justice for all\\" I was expecting this album to be even better, since the band had just reached its pinnacle of musical greatness. So then I see the video for \\"Enter Sandman\\" Now I understand that they had made their first video for MTV off the ..\\"And justice\\" album, and that would be for the song \\"One\\" Yet, I dont think it was ever written to appeal to the masses. Yes, it did get them more of a fan base, but the album still didnt pull away from their roots of thrash. SO here is the video for \\"Enter Sandman\\" and I am thinking \\"WTF?????\\" I thought it was the worst song that Metallica had ever done, and it seemed like the song was written to appeal to the masses. Then I got the album. Man, what a disapointment. Not because its not as heavy as the other albums, but it seems like they never built on the previous release, and kind of \\"dumbed down\\" their material. Are there some good songs on here? Sure, there are, but the album doesnt come close to the brillence of \\"...And Justice for All\\" There seems to be way to much of a pop Metal feel to this, and I think that Metallica could have put forth a much better effort. This is why I still am furious over \\"Load\\" Not only did they \\"dumb down\\" even more, but the song writting horrid, as well as the musical effort. Its like if you took a band with Pink Floyd's, Yes, or Rush's talent, and asked them to record an album that sounded like something from Blink-182 or Green Day. This still is a disapointment, yet still has some listenable tracks, but I can't say its the \\"Masterpiece\\" that most people think that it is.
B00005JPBL|5.0|Not being an avid fan of the first Saw and disliking a lot the second one, I nevertheless was very surprised in a good way about the third installment. Yes, it's utterly relentless and gory, I saw people covering their eyes with hands in a theater, even I winced a couple of times although I had seen many of the films alike. But what I liked the most here was not the brutal nature of Saw III (and it's quite important for the fans when a movie lives up to its R-rating, so that they can say money was spent wisely) and not even the intricate story-line that keeps you surprised and on the edge of your seat all the time. Not the final twist which was expected of course but surely you didn't know what it would be exactly.<br /><br />The main merit of the third part is that it doesn't appear to be a usual stupid sequel that lacks ideas, it brings some new sense into the series, glues all the three films together making a perfect trilogy out of it which now can be watched as a one big 5-hour film. There's plenty of flashbacks here that explain a lot from the second and even the first part, and some things become clear that were not in the ends of previous series. It really takes talent to make a movie that not just stands alone, but adds a lot to the other parts and completes them. Guys that were making it are true professionals and real maniacs :)<br /><br />And apart from being as it seems overly gory and graphic Saw III can boast of being rather thoughtful too. The evil genius of Jigsaw (and of the makers of the film) made the characters (and us along with them) think about rage and its manifestations, about revenge and people's insatiable urge to punish those who took their beloved ones. By quite simple examples inclusive of flesh-ripping, bone-crushing, joint-wresting etc. the killer himself shows us killing is bad. Those will survive who don't succumb to the desire of payback. Only forgiving can grant forgiveness for ourselves. And that's the rule for everyone, even for the evil manipulator's apprentice, and it can't be broken. Otherwise death awaits you as well as your victims. In this movie Jigsaw is seen not as an ordinary killer maniac, but as some kind of a teacher if you will. So this time his puzzles must be solved not only using strength, keen wit and will to live, but also by testing your own virtue and that's something new for this kind of flicks, don't you agree?<br /><br />I don't know what they will do with Saw IV, because the third part wrapped it all very nice making a perfectly neat structure of a trilogy. I'd leave it like that. You can top previous parts in respect of blood and guts, but it'll be pretty hard to keep the same level of thoughtfulness the third part established.ven for the evil manipulator's apprentice, and it can't be broken.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|The long awaited version of Superman II: The Donner Cut flies onto shelves with great anticipation.  Was it worth the wait?  Honestly, Yes, it was. To put it simply, it is a totally different movie.  <br /> <br />Compared to the previous version, SUPERMAN II: THE RICHARD DONNER CUT connects a whole lot better with SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE.  The characters seem to be a lot more solid in their acting here.  Lester's version seemed to be a bit of a joke, with just one slap-stick event after another.  There have been many key scenes restored that bring more sense to the events taking place in SUPERMAN II.  Stripped is all the sillyness of the three criminals, in this version they actually feel like a threat to planet earth and not some over acted side-show for Superman to beat up.   <br /> <br />I have seen many reviewers comment on how Lester's version was superior...I have to say that they are sadly mistaken.  You have to take into consideration that Donner's version was never completely finished, and what was finished has been sitting in a vault for almost 30 years.  The limited resources, and the time it took to restore this has to be commended. You truly experience movie history. This probably marks the first time a Director was fired from a job and able to go back to re-release his original version.  The spirit of what would have been an epic part II to SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE is here and is well worth seeing. <br /> <br />You have not seen SUPERMAN II until you see SUPERMAN II: THE RICHARD DONNER CUT.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Chills and goosebumps.  This is a phonomenal reimagining of classic Beatles tunes, deftly and lovingly enhanced by the Martins.  \\"Love\\" exceeded my expectations in every way.  Vocals can be heard with a clarity never before available, and the new arrangements are fresh and modern, without losing the intergrity of the originals.  I only wish that John Lennon and George Harrison could have had the opportunity to hear this.  A masterpiece.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I was pretty excited when I found out Evanescence was coming out with another album. Not because I didn't think they weren't going to produce another, I knew nothing about Ben Moody or whatever was happening with the band because honestly I don't really care; I just like the music. I was excited because I wanted to see how much the band was going to change from their first album. Am I the only one that didn't think Fallen was super awesome? Hopefully not. Because it sounded pretty generic when I first bought it... some of the lyrics I didn't even listen to because they seemed the same, for the most part. I just loved how they mixed pianos/choruses with guitars and a female voice that didn't belch-sing. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate Fallen. If I did, I wouldn't have bought The Open Door. I simply realized that Evanescence was capable of more than Fallen once I bought The Open Door. <br /> <br />If you loved the pianos and such as much as I did this album provides much more of that. The Open Door is definitely different... when I first listened to it I thought it was weird. It sounded ethereal and it reminds me of the zodiac for some reason. Maybe that's because of the artwork on the album, I suppose. It took a while before the CD hooked me and now I can't stop listening to it. <br /> <br />The lyrics are much better than the lyrics of Fallen. I can't stand some of the lyrics of Fallen sometimes. Some tracks on The Open Door are simply my favourite BECAUSE of the lyrics and not the sound. I was surprised that this album was able to hook me that way since Fallen failed to. <br /> <br />I probably would have cried if Evanescence produced something Fallen-ish. Mostly because if I wanted to listen to Fallen, I'd listen to Fallen. I don't want to buy the same CD twice. And I'm very glad the band is experimenting... that's good. <br /> <br />If you're expecting Fallen when you buy this album you're going to be disappointed. Buy Fallen again if you feel the need to hear something Fallen-ish. If you're open to something a little different, try The Open Door.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|First off, I don't want to hear anything more about how \\"none of the members shine on this disc\\". Are you even listening? I know, I know, subtlety is wasted in this culture.  This album is more focused and personal than anything I have ever heard from this band. Listen to it a few more times and maybe you'll see it. If not then you obviously don't understand it. No worries though, there will always be bands that will cater to your musical impatience. I mean, you can always turn back to your new my chemical romance disc, right?
B000I5X81K|5.0|Call it \\"Pop-Classical\\", \\"Classical-Pop\\", or my favorite \\"Popera\\", fans of any genre cannot deny the mainstream force of Josh Groban.  On his third studio disc, Groban injects a much needed shot of originality into classical music.  Personally, I was a huge fan of his first two studio albums and was taken aback by the slightly new direction, but after a few listens, it will dawn on you that this is exactly the direction he needed to take.      Here is a brief review on some of the album cuts:    \\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\"- A surrounding, thunderous, and somewhat haunting lead single from the album.  This cut sounds similar to his first two albums and will not disappoint.      \\"Mai\\"- I wouldn't have chosen this song as the lead title on the album, but it is a good listen nonetheless.  Josh seems a bit bored here.    \\"February Song\\"- An obvious favorite from the moment you hear it.  Co-written by Josh and John Ondrasik from Five for Fighting, this song extracts longing, sorrow, and hope out of the listener.      \\"Lullaby\\"- An absolute treat.  An American lullaby with an African tinge.  Adults and children alike could be put to sleep by this song (in a good way, of course)    \\"Weeping\\"- Another African influenced song, this one so upbeat that the listener will hardly notice the extremely dark lyrics.  What a great song.    \\"Machine\\"- Josh's first experiment with Jazz, and it succeeds.    \\"Awake\\"- This song was written by Josh and is only available on the extended version of the CD.  This is one of my favorite cuts off the album, so I'm not exactly sure why it was left off of the original version.  Buying the extended CD is worth every penny because of this song.  I noticed that it is also available for individual purchase on iTunes.      I hope this review helps.
0792844882|5.0|You've got to gamble if you want to win!  Love this movie... pure camp classic!
0307346609|3.0|I'm fascinated zombie movies. Zombies themselves are creepy walking corpses. The idea of being surrounded and eaten alive is terrifying. And of course there's the more subtle horror of being \\"turned\\" and joining the masses of the undead (which most certainly is a metaphor applicable to many aspects of society).   <br /> <br />More entertaining than the zombies are the situations in which the beleaguered humans find themselves. If you consider the typical zombie movie (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead [2004], etc.) you'll notice that the zombies play a peripheral role as a plot device, and that the real interest takes place among the survivors. That's what I love about the zombie genre.  <br /> <br />So, when a friend told me about \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" and \\"World War Z,\\" I was on Amazon within minutes, ordering both books. <br /> <br />I read most of \\"Survival Guide\\" on the day the books arrived. I appreciated Brooks creation of the Solanum virus to explain their existence. I was particularly pleased that he kept his zombies stupid (unlike some stories in which zombies are able to think and learn, changing the dynamic of the story completely).  <br /> <br />However, once I'd gotten through the \\"Survival Guide\\" aspect of the first book, and began reading the accounts of historic outbreaks, I realized that Brooks is not the strongest writer. He clearly did a lot of research, but somehow was unable to create authentic-sounding historical documents. He wasn't able to capture different voices.  <br /> <br />This is the root of my trouble with \\"World War Z.\\" While the book is highly entertaining, well researched and a lot of fun, I can't help but feel disappointed. I was anticipating a novel, with characters and situations spanning a pitched battle with the undead. Instead I have a collection of 2-6 page anecdotes, each told by people who I'll never get to know or care about, punctuated by asides from the interviewer who remains flat and lifeless. <br /> <br />In my mind, as I counted the days to this book's arrival, I envisioned something like the classic (albeit \\"dime store\\") novels I once read with guilty pleasure: \\"Lucifer's Hammer,\\" \\"Footfall,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" which follow multiple groups across entire continents and epic struggles at the end of civilization.  <br /> <br />This is not such a book. For that reason I am disappointed. But I am deriving a satisfactory amount of guilty pleasure from it nonetheless.  <br />
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I have to tell you, I'm something of a t.v. snob.  I haven't really enjoyed a half-hour comedy since Titus was cancelled.  All the dramas on t.v. seem to be doctor, lawyer, or cop shows (boring).  And I'll set myself on fire before I'll waste time on a \\"reality\\" show on one of those prime-time game shows.<br /><br />So I was delighted to discover this little gem of a show on CBS's Monday night lineup.  I initially tuned it because 2 of the 5 regular cast members were on two of the greatest t.v. shows ever: Alyson Hannigan from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Jason Segel from Freaks and Geeks.  And I was just as surprised as anyone else when I soon realized the real scene-stealer was Neil Patrick Harris.  Barney Stinson is a classic character, and it's a crime if Harris doesn't nab an Emmy nomination.<br /><br />It must be hard to come up with fresh material for a sitcom. . .but somehow, the writers manage to pull it off.  Plus, the cast easily has the best chemistry since \\"Friends\\" (rivaled this season only by the cast of \\"The Class,\\" another criminally-underrated show).  Marshall and Lily (Segel and Hannigan) are TV's Best Couple.<br /><br />But let's talk Emmy's again for a second.  \\"Drumroll, Please\\" is not only the season one highlight, I would rank in in the top 10 sitcom episodes EVER.  In case you missed it (SPOILERS), Ted meets a woman at a wedding, and the two spend a perfect evening together while vowing NOT to see each ever again.  You have to see it to get the full impact, but it's funny and touching and very original.<br /><br />Several people have complained about the DVD's being released full-frame.  I don't personally own a widescreen t.v., and I don't know anyone who does.  If it's that important to you, record the shows off the air. . .if you can afford a widescreen t.v., you can surely get a DVD recorder or DVR or whatever.<br /><br />We always look forward to Monday nights at my house.  Now, thanks to DVD, we can watch this great show anytime.  Watch Deal or No Deal if you must, but pick up How I Met Your Mother on DVD!time.  Watch Deal or No Deal if you must, but pick up How I Met Your Mother on DVD! <br />
0440236304|5.0|This, along with Mr Burgett's 3 other works are simply the best first person accounts of combat in North west Europe ever written.  I notice many other reviewers here point out that this book is similar to Band of Brothers, this is misleading, because Burgett's books predate those of Ambrose by decades.  This is gut-wrenching, heart-pounding, sweat inducing writing of a young man in combat - no false heroics, no overviews, no discussion of strategy and planning - just plain-talking real experiences. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this and Mr Burgett's other books highly enough.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|Una edicion muy especial con un sonido excelente y una envoltura de lujo. Yo creo que lo principal en cualquier disco nuevo que salga a la venta de los Beatles, en grupo o en solitario, es la calidad del sonido y en sus presentaciones (Dolby 5.1, 2.1 o DTS). Creo tambien que en el catalogo de Harrison estan teniendo mucho cuidado al respecto. Basta con oir la nueva edicion de los discos del periodo Dark Horse (2004), All Thing Must Pass (2002) y la reciente Living In The Material World para darse cuenta que quieren dar a conocer la musica de George a las nuevas generaciones de manera impecable (y de paso ganar unos cuantos billetes). <br /> <br />Este DVD encierra mucha nostalgia, tiene una replica del manuscrito en donde George compuso el tema Bangladesh, fotos del concierto, un sticker para tu guitarra, un cuadernillo sobre el concierto y un poster. Es en verdad una edicion de lujo, vale su precio. Sobre el concierto en si, que se puede decir, si eres un devoto de los Beatles sabes de que trata y lo que contiene. Compralo, elige la opcion de sonido que mas te guste y disfruta clasicos como While my guitar gently weeps, es delicioso escuchar por un canal el solo de guitarra de Clapton y por el otro el de la guitarra de George casi al finalizar la cancion. Un dato adicional es la presentacion de Bob Dylan, un motivo mas para tener este DVD. En el segundo DVD podras ver tomas y canciones ineditas y a su vez observar cuan viejos estan los sobrevivientes. Tanta droga y tanto alcohol tiene su precio.

B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I just want to start off by sort of replying to some reviews I have already read.  If you are a true incubus fan, then you hopefully realize by now that you simply cannot compare any of their albums to each other.  Not a single one of their albums is anything like any of their others, so lets not play the comparison game. <br /> <br />I think all of the songs on this album are unique in their own way, and i think that the band did a great job of blending more mellow songs with some that were a little \\"harder\\", if you will (and no, i do not mean hard like SCIENCE). <br /> <br />I'm not going to go through this album song by song, because I think that it is a waste of time, and I think that each song is good in their own way.  They have done a great job in the way they structure this album, and it keeps you interested the entire time. <br /> <br />I would reccomend this album to anyone, whether they listen to much incubus or not.
6301658795|5.0|I am recommending this tape to any serious music fanatic. Being an old curmudgeon probably helps with the fascination of this film as I can relate to the 50's era. What a change from Newport to Woodstock, only 10 years later. Growing up in the Hippie years and looking back to 1958, I feel we have lost a way of life along the way. If you are looking for a peek into the 50's, buy this. The filming is great for it's time (35mm). Oh, how I long for those days to return after watching this flim.
B000JBXXZ4|2.0|i agree with Diana M. Weaver this cd really isnt that great. incubus other cds are a whole lot better. i really dont like how they have hearsts all over thier cd, nwhat the crap is that all about, their not emo. if you're going to buy an incubus cd get a different one.
055358202X|3.0|I have to say this book was a disappointment. The first three books in this series were unquestionably 5-star reading.    A Feast for Crows, however, truly was -- as one reviewer described it -- a chore to get through. I wondered often as I read it whether Martin would have fared better to collapse this book and the sequel, A Dance with Dragons, into one volume after all. The argument that the book would have then been too long doesn't wash with me since many of the chapters here -- far too many -- felt like \\"packing material\\", the popcorn and bubblewrap that you have to dig through to get to the good stuff that you really wanted and paid for. A Feast for Crows would have been a far better book if the dross chapters had been eliminated and the pure gold chapters from the next book added in. Ah, well. Too late for that now.    Sadly, in this book, I just got bored. Not only once, but again and again. And I am astounded to say that because Martin is a magnificent writer and storyteller. But I was seriously bored with much of this book.    I did not like Martin's departure from the style of previous books of adding so many nameless (\\"The Prophet\\", \\"The Kraken's Daughter\\", etc.) point-of-view (POV) chapters. Sheesh. Why not just say their names? \\"Aeron\\" ... \\"Asha\\" ... Worse still, most of these \\"secondary\\" POV chapters were quite dull. I did not like these characters and I did not want to invest my time in them because it is not THEIR story I am interested in in this series. Many of these secondary characters are repellent, dull, and/or unpleasant, and each new character's chapter(s) carried the baggage of (seemingly) 50 to 60 new names and characters apiece.    Even the primary POVs in this volume, including Brienne, Jaime, and Cersei, are not particularly likable or interesting. That leaves about 20% of the book that really held my interest. Only the Samwell, Arya, and Sansa chapters held my attention here, and the latter two characters appear very little in this particular volume. The one good thing about this overall structure was that at least I knew before reading a chapter that I probably wasn't going to enjoy it: \\"Brienne\\", \\"Cersei\\", \\"Jaime\\", \\"Unnamed\\" = Not Terribly Interesting. Best not be sleepy if you want to get through any of these chapters in one sitting.    To the author's credit, the pace of Feast for Crows does pick up toward the end of the book, which, alas, once again leaves us hanging for heaven knows how long until the next book is published -- longer still if these particular \\"King's Landing\\" POV plot threads are not to be picked back up until Book 6. Patience, more than any other quality, is required of readers of this series.    Even so, I am committed to this series for the long haul. Martin at his worst is better than most writers in this genre at their very best. He is a most gifted and talented writer, and I trust he can get back on course for the next book in this series. I am keeping my fingers crossed that there is someone in this process that can effectively tell Martin, for future volumes in this series, \\"Yo, dude. This chapter is well written, surely, but it really ought to be cut...\\"      EDIT, June 10, 2011--  In anticipation of the publication of Book 5, A Dance with Dragons, next month, I have been rereading this series. The first three books were a joy (yet again), but this one, not so much. If you are tackling Book 4, A Feast for Crows, either for the first time or if you're rereading the series, and you find yourself struggling with this particular  volume, I recommend the following:    (1) Read the Prologue.  (2) Then skip to chapter 5, the first Samwell chapter, and read it.  (3) Thereafter, read ONLY the Jaime, Sansa/\\"Alayne\\", Arya/\\"Cat of the Canals\\", and Samwell chapters. Skip all of the Cersei, Brienne, and remaining \\"Unnamed\\" chapters -- all of them.  (4) Finally, after that, check the A Feast for Crows Wikipedia entry for brief plot synopses of the portions you skipped past.    This cuts the book by more than half, I know, but trust me. It's better this way.     The Prologue and final Samwell chapter give the book a satisfying sense of completion and closure, and the story overall moves along at a much brisker clip. Of the two Lannisters represented here (how I missed Tyrion in this book!), Jaime is definitely more interesting than Cersei, and he lets you know all you really need to know about Cersei (and Brienne, too) from his point of view.    And, of course, the skipped chapters will always be there, waiting for you, just like the La Brea Tar Pits, should you ever feel inclined to wade through them.
B000002BE9|5.0|this album is wonderful, it is blues based, with jazzy tunes, yet there is a rock /pop componenet as well. for those of you that love tori amos and the like. This album is a bit mellow and sad though. no real fast songs to groove to.

B000J10ERO|3.0|What happens when you make a film in the year 2006 but make it as if it was the 1980's? Superman Returns is one giant homage to the original. From the opening theme you already know that Singer is in love with the original and wants nothing more then to recreate it for you in the guise of a \\"sequel\\".  <br /> <br /> Four years have passed since Superman left on a wild goose chase and it seems time must have stopped still because this film tries so hard to emulate the first two films that it never becomes its own film. Its one giant wink and if you aren't winking back then this isn't going to be a fun ride.  <br /> <br />Everyone is miscast and the film has even less action then the original film. By the time they put Superman in the emergency room...if your not laughing as they try to work on him...well then you are taking this movie far too seriously.  <br /> <br />Thats the main problem is that Bryan Singer took this film way too seriously. Where's the American flag? Where's the modo \\"truth justice and the american way?\\" Its no where to be found and yet Spiderman has no problem displaying some good ol' american pride.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the sequel can liven things up but they have a long way to go and it may take a huge shake up at Warner Brothers to make it happen.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000J103X4|4.0|Yep it pretty much sounds like a continuation of The Documentary which actually isn't a bad thing for a sophmore joint.  I mean most fans were at the very least expecting GAME to keep it as raw and tight as the first one and Doctor's Advocate does that and more.  Leaving G-Unit and Aftermath was actually a great thing for him.  He doesn't need to be pigeonholed into thinking DRE was the sole reason for his success and he definitely doesn't need to be associated with a weak mob like G-Unit (How good is that money looking now Mobb Deep.  You not only sold your soul but have lost your following messing with 50 da rat).  Hopefully Young Buck will have enough sense to get outta there and go independent.  <br /> <br />However, it's usually by the third release where the fans are gonna start wondering when the artist is gonna kick some real sh@$$%t?  I mean droppin real life joints beacause there are a plethora of issues not only in all our hoods everyday, but issues young black males still have to overcome daily.  That's is what seperated 2PAC from everyone else is the fact that he could keep it gangsta, he could keep it club, he could keep it politically incorrect, but most of all, he could keep it real with our folks, male and female alike without droppin jokers names all over his record like that 50 cent rat drops dimes.  Hip Hop has always been about braggadacio and bravado since it's inception and will never change.  However, at some point, an artists longetivity will be determined by whether he change up his albums without losing his loyal following.  Whether he or she can make us feel his or her pain and struggles or is the artist rappin about somebody else's and we see right through him as a wannabe.  Or if the artists will just continue putting out the same ole same ole just to collect some bucks and look for mainstream radio airplay.  Age also will determine that as well.  Most rappers that hit their mid-thirties just aren't as angry, nor are they as hungry as they were coming into the business.  GAME has to make sure that he doesn't fall into that category of just rappin repeatedly about himself, his riches, giving too much props to DRE and other artists repeatedly and most important break outta that diss game which can just as easily ruin a career as it can jump start one.  It was absolutely a pleasure watching him dismantle G-Unit almost singlehandedly (Fat Joe, Scarface, and I'm sure Jada later on have put their hammer down on them already).  Other than that, this joint is vicious and hope GAME keeps choosing quality production and keeps honing his skills to get better and better with each outing.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I have been waiting for this complete set and am very happy with it.  The design is fantastic, the extra hidden disc great.  Only problem,now I have no more Alias to look forward to!  If you are a fan or know one this is the best gift you could give them!
B000JJRIO8|2.0|That Ms Afeni Shakur would allow folks to pretend to know what a PAC album would sound like if he was still living.  His vocals alone should be able to sell any posthumous release without watering it down.   <br /> <br />Listening to this version of PAC's Life was sickening.  I have the orignal bootleg version of it using Prince's \\"Pop Life\\" and it was rugged and raw just like it was.  <br /> <br />It's almost becoming more detrimental to PAC's legacy to keep letting other artist collaborate on these tracks instead of just using the regular unreleased versions with PAC solely on it on w/him and the Outlawz the way it was intended to be.   <br /> <br />I just hope Ms Shakur and the rest of the Amaru staff would just realize that when it's not broke, stop looking for a crack.  All this does is just make me pull out the old Makavelli boots and reminisce just how vicious PAC was as an artist and as a young black male. <br /> <br />RIP <br /> <br />Your \\"Soldier Story\\" will live on.

B000IU3XTW|5.0|Foo has been one of my favorite bands for many years, and oddly enough, one of the few bands that I have never seen live in concert. The few times they have been nearby (Toronto 90 minutes from me), it has fallen on the worst possible day for me so I could never go.  <br /> <br />I decided to grab this album because obviously I'm a fan of the band, but more so because I noticed that Marigold was on there. This was pretty odd to see because, as I'm sure many of you know, that was the b-side to the Heart Shaped Box single by Nirvana, and the first song that Dave sang on that was released on a label. Such a great tune, and very cool to see on this album. It's done beautifully too. <br /> <br />I don't often enjoy \\"Live\\" albums by bands, if I hear something Live, I want it to be at the concert that I am attending....I just don't find it as exciting just listening to it. I figure, if I'm going to just listen to a CD, why not listen to the actual song? But THIS is absolutely wonderful. It's songs I've grown to love, done in a very relaxing way and this album flows so well from start to finish. <br /> <br />One of my favorite things about this album is that all the songs are sort of \\"redone\\" to fit a mellow mood. Most bands that release live albums don't put in the effort to do anything special with the concert they are recording and the fact that this was all done specifically for this was a very cool surprise. You're not buying a CD full of poorly done live songs, or an album put out to make money (ahem--pearljam), or something put out to get out of a recording contract like bands often do. This is an album that you can tell a lot of effort and heart was put into it by the band. Any live album I've purchased in the past I've usually listened to 1 time and thrown on the CD rack....I have already listened to this in full upwards of 25 times in the past few weeks...I just cannot say enough good things about it. <br /> <br />Definitely check it out. I also see there is a DVDreleased that I plan to pick up after enjoying this so much.
B00004KD11|2.0|This isn't very good and it's not the Deep Purple that came out with...In Rock. <br />There's maybe three somewhat decent songs and the rest are a boreing overload. <br />The singer sounds dated and so do the band. <br />I'd say Hush, Help and Hey Joe are the best tracks. <br />And either one did the band write. <br />However if your a big Deep Purple fan and want all there stuff. <br />Buy this one because it's got the bonus tracks. <br />Which are basically OK. <br />DON'T PAY MUCH! BECAUSE THE BAND AND ALBUM SOUNDS LIKE THERE STUCK IN 1968. <br />SOME RECORDS ALWAYS SEEM FRESH...NOT THIS ONE.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The Beatles are the greatest group of guys in recorded history. I was first unsure how to feel about this cd because of some of the negative feedback about how it's just their work remixed for money purposes etc. After a loud session with the headphones and a peaceful atmosphere I was saying at the end of the cd that I wish they would re record everything. Some of the songs are just fantastic. The re-edited songs sound better than ever. The way they brought out their sounds is simply amazing. It sounds new and fresh. It's very heavy John and George but that fine. Come Together with Paul brought out more in the background is awesome. The crispness of the music is just so mystical. There aren't any bad songs here. I could care less about \\"Octopus's Garden\\" but the rest is very good. <br />Don't listen to the negative hype until you hear it for yourself. And remember it's a soundtrack to a Cirque de Soleil piece. Just crank it up like it's suppose to sound and sit back.

B00004R99J|5.0|Pocahontas (Disney Gold Classic Collection)~ Irene Bedard is not even close to being a historically accurate movie. Then again this is a great animated classic created by the amazing minds working for Disney. The music is amazing, the songs are a bit sappy and laden with way to much emotions at times but that is the Disney trademark after all. The animation is some of the best in the business and Mel Gibson does a bang up job doing the voice for John Smith. The message of the movie is good for children as it teaches tolerance and this is very important in todays multicultural society. I would definitely give this 5 stars since it is one of the best animated created in quite a while!

B000IJ79WU|4.0|The Donner Cut is not going to take its place along side the Director's Cut of Bladerunner or The Extended Edition of Lord of the Rings as \\"The Definative Edition\\" of Superman II.  Having just seen it, I see it more as a alternative version than as an outright replacement.    What I liked:  I thought the overall tone of the film was more consistent with the first film than was the Lester version.  I thought the scenes with Marlon Brando were great, and felt that they added more to the film on an emotional level.  All and all, I felt that the Donner scenes were superior to the Lester ones.  I liked that most of the cheesy attempts at humor were left on the cutting room floor.      What I didn't like:  All the classic stuff that's not in the new film.  The redneck bar masacre: gone.  The Eifle Tower Sequence: gone.  \\"I am selfish when it comes to you, and I'm jealous of the whole world\\": gone.  And the best line in the whole movie, the line that made the hairs stand up on the nape of my neck in anticipation, the line that made the entire audience go \\"Yeah!\\"  The line of course, is \\"General, would you care to step outside?\\" Its been replaced a line of dialogue that's unbelievably lame.    As for the debate over whether or not Superman could have sex with a human without killing her, its really just a matter of opinion, since its a fictional character we're talking about, so I defend Donner's decision, he being the director.  DC Comics owns the rights to the character, and they had Superman marry Lois a decade or so ago, so the view of the copyright holders is that yes, he can have sex with mortals.  Having said that, I still feel that Lester's version works better for the film and makes more sense.    What nearly spoiled it for me is the ending.  The time travel thing worked great in the first film, but it was a one-trick pony.  In my opinion, the film should have ended with \\"your secret's safe with me.\\"  As other's have pointed out, it means that Superman abused his powers and victimized a helpless mortal who had never actually harmed him.  Come to think of it, though, Superman comes off as kind of a jerk in the Lester version, too.    All things considered, I think the Lester version is the better film.  Sorry, Dick, I was rooting for you, but I have to be honest.
0393317552|2.0|This is what happens when a biased biologist plays at historian.  From the early pages Diamond is clear in his bias that his friends the New Guinea Highlanders are the most intelligent people on the planet.  His reasoning that you take an average American and drop him into their hunter-gatherer society and he'd never survive.  Though the exact same thing would happen if you took a NG highlander and dropped him in a Wal-Mart.  His disregard for major western military victories are glossed over if mentioned at all.  Some good stuff on the history of human crops, but useless beyond that.  Read Carnage & Culture instead.

B0000797IO|4.0|First of all, I just have to say that even though the reviews on the DVD box and even some reviewers here have called this a comedy, it's not.  <br />The story centers around Justine (Aniston), a woman who is discontent with her boring job and her (really) fat husband. She has an affair with a younger coworker (gyllenhaal), which sets off a chain of events that ends in tragedy. I really enjoyed the movie. The movie creates this unique universe that makes you feel how bored Aniston's character is with her life. <br />This movie is a very good drama. It pulls you into the story emotionally, and while it's not the most complex movie I've ever watched, a lot of emotional things happen. I was really surprised at how good of an actress Jennifer Aniston is. The only thing I'd ever seen her in was Friends, so I didn't really expect her acting to be as good as it was. Everyone's performances were very good, for that matter.  <br />Bottom line: check this movie out.
B000002GKT|4.0|Back when I was 18, I saw my first concert in Hyde Park, London, a freebie with Head Hands and Feet ( Albert Lee ), Humble Pie, and Grand funk Railroad.  <br /> <br />I suppose it is a little like your first girlfriend, you always have fond memories, but in the last 36 years I dont think I have EVER heard a band to better Humble Pie live. I remember walking through London and seeing this album displayed in HMV records .. I didnt know it was going to come out .. loads and loads of covers all strung up. ( As an aside, I want to thank whoever strung all those covers up, because that shop window is emblazoned on my memory even now ) ....I bought it immediately and have NEVER forgotten how great it sounds. <br /> <br />Sure, it could be engineered a bit better, blah blah, but there are two bits of sheer unsurpassed rock magic on this album. Greg Ridleys bass coming in at the start of \\"I dont need no Doctor\\" and the first couple of bars of the ending of Rolling stone ... duh duh, do duh duh ..... I have been air guitaring those moments for 36 years !! <br /> <br />If you ever feel sorry for kids these days who are bombarded by hyped up c**p 24 hours a day, you owe it to yourself to go back to albums like this and thank God that people like Steve, Peter, Greg and Jerry ( as well as Clem later) knew what ROCK really meant <br /> <br />Oh hell, I am getting too nostalgic, but how many groups are there around today that will bring smiles 36 years later ? <br /> <br />
B000I5X80G|2.0|When I came across this new release in a record store, I was very surprised, to put it mildly. During the last Neil Young interview that I read, he said that the first Archives release would consist of 8 cd's full of great, old live shows including one showcasing \\"Harvest\\" in its entirety. So what's up with this rip-off?
B000J10ERO|1.0|Here is the low down on how this movie works: <br />You are shown the beginning of a scenario. Then you are shown the end of that scenario, and it's up to you, the viewer, to imagine what happens in-between. <br />This is an effective technique used in movie making. The problem is that it's the _only_ technique used in this movie. This is lazy film making. Given the high price tag of this movie, someone got ripped off big time. The viewer definitely gets short changed. <br />But if your idea of a good action flick is to watch the main character pose during the entire movie, then, you will love Superman Returns. As for the producer, I would recommend that he move to greener pastures in the domain of drama movies. <br />Hopefully, in the next Superman movie, we will have him actually Reach Out and TOUCH someone ... Hahaha ... Someone like the \\"Doomsday/Sanction\\", or better yet ... the one and only Darkseid (the only one who puts hate in the heart of the Man of Steel ;) <br />

Many things have been said; some at great length, about the acting, special effects, use of relationships and etc.<br /><br />SUPERMAN is simply who he is.  He is alone, and yet not really.  He has to learn the consequences of his trip to the dead Planet Krypton.  He finally discovers that life; (Kryptonian life), does find a way to survive!  Thank you Miss Lane...<br /><br />To me SUPERMAN will always be George Reeves jumping out of that window in the Daily Planet Building.  But then, I'm 50 years old!  There is plenty of room in The Fortress of Solitude for the nostalgic and the modern.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie.  I bought it and enjoy very much.
0440241588|2.0|About 70% of the book is about JB's Italian language lessons - rather boring.  Then, the last 7 chapters (out of 36 chs) get interesting, but not that interesting.   <br /> <br />This was another of John Grisham boring line of books.  Except for King of Torts, Grisham hasn't written a good book in a while
B00004XONN|5.0|I bought this album when it was released in 1999, and it remains my favorite album of all time. This album is a vast, lush landscape of sounds that was, and is, years ahead of its time. This album is far more than an \\"experiment\\" in electronic rock-- every song is different and becomes more meaningful after each listen. This album is also an emotional masterpiece- it appeals stronly to the alienation and dissociation we percieve as humans. Kid A changed my life and my perspective on music.
B000JJRIO8|1.0|Terrible shame that they think 2pac's lyrics won't sell themselves.So they have to add the pop culture beats to sell records.The only song on the album that i actually like is \\"soon as i get home\\" just because it's the only one that feels like a 2pac song.all the rest are sad attepts to sell records, and how could you even try to perfect the previously unreleased \\"Untouchble\\" I'm sure every 2pac fan thought it was perfect the way it was and twice on the album ruined the song.Pac I love you but if you were alive today I know you would've gave us a better album but what can we do now. R.I.P
B000002HD5|3.0|I have been ambivalent about this record for years.  A slow start builds intensity and then at the climax it just lets you down. Do I really care that much about their pathetic romantic lives?  Perhaps, they bored their lovers into leaving them.  Perhaps I am just too calloused to be such a gentleman as to give this an overwhlemingly positive review. Perhaps chauvinism bores me.  I really like AW but this is not my favorite record.  The three songs listed above are genius and the band deserves all the credit in the world for their creativity.  I bought the record for just those songs and it was a good investment because I cannot really say it is a bad record either.  Perhaps those songs are so good that the others just pale in comparison.  In any case, I recommend it but do not get your hopes up after Debonair song
B0000E6I1J|5.0|George set me on a path when I was a brat, trying to figure things out. What an exquisite appreciation, from his profane to his holy to his rock and roll!  <br />I'm still on the path, gentle,  silly, forgiving, celebratory....  <br />As the Dalai Lama said, \\"My religion is Kindness\\".  <br />Thank you, George, again and again and again!
B000001Y5X|5.0|This used to be my least favorite release due to its lackluster production quality in comparison to releases like Antichrist and Mechanical. But you've got to consider the time, 1994. Grunge was dead and something dark and more innovative in music was starting to form. Portrait was the beginning of this change. Its a great album, not to be taken too seriously. It shows Mansons roots, his youthful rage, not yet completely clouded by his own nihilism.<br /><br />Its punky metal with industrial fuzz all around the edges. From start to finish its a solid album, catchy, enjoyable with enough hooks to keep your average listener interested. Compared to a lot of other bands & albums that came out around that time, Portrait sets the standard. Quality songwriting, overall structure and a valid message delivered with a candy coated fist to the face.<br /><br />Just the beginning of Mansons legendary career, and definitly worth purchasing.
B000GFLE86|2.0|After Careless Love, this was a major disappointment.  It's difficult to decide if it is the song selection or the audio that makes this release so unsatisfying.  Ms. Peyroux sounds like someone forgot to turn her mic on.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I loved Donnie Darko. I thought it was a quirky, crazy 80s period piece and had a killer soundtrack (loved the use of the Killing Moon during the opening sequence, thank god they didn't stick with the INXS song I believe was supposed to go instead). Initially, I thought it was about schizophrenia, to discover later on that this theme merely wrapped itself around a much more complex, albeit \\"unrealistic\\", centre, concerning theology, the transcendence of the soul, and time travel. <br />I thought Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was very good, he gave body and credibility to a character who appears (and most likely, is) totally unfocused, troubled, nihilistic, yet proves to also be intelligent and aware of all the good and the bad around him. I wasn't much of a fan of the actress that played Gretchen, nor the character itself. I could never tell if she had any motivations, if she was truly concerned about her family situation, and why she was with Donnie in the first place. Other than that, I loved the styllization of the movie, the clever use of imagery, and yes... the Smurf monologue. <br />It is in no way \\"avant-garde\\" art, but it will make you think, and it keeps you glued to your seat.
B00005R8GU|5.0|I love this CD.  It really captured a moment in time when the torch was being passed to a new generation of bluesmen.  Too bad that torch has for the most part gone out, as popular music has once again slid into forgetting it's roots.  One hopes for a revival equivalent to the 60's when pop music last connected with it's soul. That being said, the performances on the studio portion of the CD are played a little too dispassionately -- with surgeon's precision but with a lack of excitement that the live tracks convey.  Maybe this is because of the way studio albums are produced, but this is the impression I got.  Nevertheless: if you don't have the CD, get it.
B000H1QYXY|5.0|What can one say  for the Living ,For the Loving and For the Loyal George Michaels has Delivered Past Present and Future with this Wonderful Album 25 live.<br /><br />From his beginning with Wham to Super Stardom  George has allowed us to be apart of his Journey with his Music and Lyrics.<br /><br />all of this Music is Timesless and Fresh George Thanks for keeping it Real.<br /><br />Jon Lopez
B00008QSA5|5.0|This CD is really a first class picture window into a time when the blues reigned and groups like Led Zeppelin, Grand Funk Railroad, and other blues/rock progenitors commanded the charts. Exiles Stephen Stills (Buffalo Springfield) Mike Bloomfield (Electric Flag), and Al Kooper (Blood Sweat and Tears) crawled from the wreckage of their former projects to the studio to record 10 hours of sessions and produce this heartfelt blues/rock masterpiece. Everyone plays as if it's their last album, and the mood is one of celebration and exultation in the music.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|When I first heard, A Crow... I couldn't believe how different it sounded from most music I hear. With songs like \\"megalomaniac\\" , \\"Talk Show On Mute\\" , \\"Agoraphobic\\" , \\"Southern Girl\\" , \\"Sick Sad Little World\\" , \\"Here In My Room\\" - A Crow was the \\"tallest\\" cd I heard in that April of 2004. Incubus conquered all my hopes and became my favorite band and that hasn't changed since. Compared to A Crow, Light Grenades isn't all that complete a record but yet again Brandon Boyd and his outfit manage to punch a chord that sounds more sublime than most music put out this year.<br /><br />At this point I must say, Incubus has never experimented with any disc as they have done with Light Grenades. I saw the album cover and I didn't know what to make of it.<br /><br />Welcome to Light Grenades.<br /><br />\\"Quicksand\\" - Most unusual Incubus starter. Increases curiosity, It definitely reminds me of \\"Atlantic\\" by Keane. Quicksand is like a drapery of sound in which Boyd introduces the eager listener to yet another moodswing of sound.  \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off\\" - This is the song you begin to bang your neck to. This song threatens to sound like the song of the year. The breakdown and the earth shattering lightning performance will blow your head off. Reminiscent of Incubus's punchier youthful sound. \\"Dig\\" - It is the best song of the disc. Powerful chords. Outstanding circle of vocals that grow on you with every listen. The chorus is a winner. [entered my list of all time favorite Incubus tracks the first day I heard it] \\"Anna Molly\\" - I'm not a fan but at the rate, I'm listening to this cd, I might like it sometime in the future. \\"Love Hurts\\" - First off. A big shut the oasis up to everyone who says this a weak track. This song is meant for day dazers like me. Outstanding track. \\"Paper Shoes\\" - \\"I fly.I soar.This I adore and then like a locomotive the sound of your sorrow comes. I'm tired of the way it feels.I only apologized to you to make you feel better.I think I've outgrown that horsehair sweater.I'd rather be alone.\\" Paper Shoes is a successful experiment. \\"Pendulous Threads\\" - I hear wires, beepers and guitars in a chaotic frenzy when I hear this track. And then I hear drums eager to break free. Mediocre.<br /><br />Conclusion - You will not hear the \\"Make Yourself\\" Incubus on Light Grenades. Nor will you hear the \\"Morning View\\". Fans of SCIENCE might like this cd. Fans of A Crow will dig it, too. This cd misses out on those electrifying life giving tracks like \\"Southern Girl\\" or \\"Just A Phase\\" or even on the furiously addictive, \\"Idiot Box\\". LIGHT GRENADES still manages to be an interesting adventure for fans. However, I cannot help but say that, I am a bit disappointed with this cd. I expected them to give more heart and more direction to their sound than what they did. Even as an experiment, this cd is worth the buy. And Incubus still reign...<br /><br />Chaos.hat horsehair sweater.I'd rather be alone.\\" Paper Shoes is a successful experiment. \\"Pendulous Threads\\" - I hear wires, beepers and guitars in a chaotic frenzy when I hear this track.

B000068GA4|5.0|this is a great listen and better than danzig's debut release in my opinion.  of course i like everthing glenn danzig has released from the misfits to samhain to danzig...the man is a musical mastermind.  anyways...my fav track on here is blood and tears because its alot slower than his usual stuff but still somehow pulls you in.  all of the tracks have something to offer though.
B000H5U832|5.0|well, ARG!  Kids movies.  I mean, Cars actually seemed like a full blown movie, while the aforementioned movies were held together by a paper thin plot.  Over the Hedge was a good 4 star movie, while The Wild was more like 3 star, but I'm getting off track. <br /> <br />Cars is the newest Pixar movie, and the only animated movies I'll be willing to see in theater is a Pixar, Aardman, OR Shrek movie.  I didn't see Cars in theatres because I heard it wasn't as good as the other Pixar movies and not as funny.  MAN I h*te critics sometimes.  This is a very good movie and should win Best Animated movie for the Oscars.  IT was better than A Bug's Life and as good as Monsters Inc.  While I think Finding Nemo and The Incredibles were better this is definately a great movie.   <br /> <br />The movie is all about appreciating the little things in life and slowing down.  Its not really funny, its more like a heartfelt, old fashioned movie.  The direction is great, Voice work is great, and to all those people who say it was too long I say, \\"You have ADD, get some Meds.\\"
B000J10ERO|5.0|Brandon Routh does present a good Superman even in light of those that think Superman should be witty & charismatic, even funny. That is the main problem with this world, Superman should be Captain Marvel, Dick Van Dyke, Hamlet, and Orson Wells all wrapped into one for our amusement and entertainment into believing there really is a Superman. That is the problem with legends throughout history, they are just people with extraordinary circumstances. They are not stand up comedians or grand philosophers. Superman is the last son of Krypton. He's at a point of struggling to find himself as well as be himself, a not so easy journey even for a man of steel. He is really an ordinary person with out of this world superpowers, and that's what makes him a Superman, not his lighter than air quips or fast talk, or gift for gab. That is why Brandon makes a fine Superman, not only does he look good, but he is a simple down to earth level headed soul. Just the right touch from Mr. Rough who leaves the stereotypical macho schmuck behind.
038572179X|3.0|Atonement is an intricately developed novel that is divided into 3 parts.  Although McEwan is a skilled writer, the first section of the novel only spans the course of a single day and I felt the pacing was particularly laborious and torpid; I kept phoning a friend whom I knew had read the book to ask when something - anything! - was going to happen.  The writing was fine, but it wasn't so captivating that the complete lack of significant action went unnoticed. <br /> <br />The novel can be broken into \\"before dinner\\" and \\"after dinner\\".  Thankfully everything picks up significantly \\"after dinner\\".  After finally breaking into this part of the book, the more you read, the more you are rewarded because the better the book gets.  In fact, after having spent nearly 2 weeks on Part One, I read the rest of the book in two days.  Rather than being somewhat meandering prose, the story begins to actually mean something.  I got the sense that much like his main character, Bryony, McEwan was atoning himself... for the first part of the book! <br /> <br />Some people will be surprised by the ending.  Personally I felt that the ending was a rather predictible choice as far as unpredictible reveals go, but perhaps that's because I also believe the choice McEwan made was the only one that the story and overall themes of the book could allow.  I would have been disappointed if it had not ended the way it did.  It doesn't hurt that the ending greatly improves the book as a whole, and sets the stage for re-readings. <br /> <br />In sum, there are pacing problems, but the characters are well-developed (if flawed) and the writing is nice.  If you perservere, you will be rewarded for it.
B000JK8OYU|2.0|i was kinda of excited about this but actually listening to it is a different story. <br /> <br />you gotta ask yourself - do you really want to hear snippets of beatles songs? do you really want these artificial mixes and transitions to get stuck in your head in place the original songs? <br /> <br />if you need a beatles fix - i would suggest getting the anthologies (especially 2 and 3) and putting them on shuffle.
1416909532|1.0|If you haven't read the hardcopy version DO NOT waste your money on this marketing gimmick. Even if you have read the book, DO NOT waste your money on this gimmick. An abridgement is a shortened form of a work that retains the sense and unity of the original. Not so here. It is a series of sound bites randomly plucked from the book. This is a sad attempt to extract additional profit from a popular book. The hardcopy version offers some interesting insights. Stay with that, you'll get much more out of it.
B00005JPAM|4.0|The mood of this film is very careful, reverent, and poised, much like Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II. It plays out patiently over a very emotional issue for many people around the world: the death of Princess Diana and the reaction of the English monarchy.<br /><br />Peter Morgan's script does an excellent job of presenting all sides of an historical moment. It never feels as if he's trying to garner sympathy for any parties involved. We see the queen trying to deal with the situation in the way that she sees fit: the most traditional, nonreactionary, unemotional way. We see Tony Blair trying to convince her that this is not the proper way to proceed. We see the public's reaction to Diana's death.<br /><br />What struck me the most about the film was how the power of the media was displayed. In numerous scenes, the prime minister is shown scanning the headlines for the public's reactions. The queen is shown watching news reports of people's reactions. When Tony Blair attempts to side with the Queen slightly and help her the newspapers don't report it, they continue to report the queen's lack of action. To me, this brought into the equation the very real idea that while the government may rule, the media can decide what to say about events, and therefore effect public opinion in a much more direct way.<br /><br />This film moves slowly, but is never boring. It definitely opens up many topics of conversation. This was a very well thought out and executed film.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|The concept/problem with the Collector's Edition Alias Series Box Set are both highly similar to those of the series when looked at as a whole: Full of a rare beauty and promise that ULTIMATELY would get trashed by cheapness, laziness, and incompetence.<br /><br />This Set SHOULD have been the crowning addition to any serious dramatist's collection -- 'cause no one does it better than Alias when it's running on all cylinders -- but the ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS disc sleeve packaging delivered all 20-something discs to my door horribly scratched on not one but on two orders.  The packaging concept was terrific and it's REALLY too bad that the people that conceived the design for the packaging obviously have yet to realize that discs need protection from scratching as much as they need it from spindle-jumping impacts.<br /><br />As a series, despite the legions of Season 3, Season 4, and Season 5 naysayers, the show (mostly evenly) managed to hold it's own until the very last two episodes of the series which effectively betrayed the Bristows, the fans, and the all-important Mother-Father-Daughter SpyFamily Magic which made the show so emotionally resonant, beautiful, and heartbreaking.  Only emotionally crippled men who find \\"depth\\" in Mission Impossible, Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade, and The Empire Strikes Back will be truly happy with the mechanics of the ending though the Sydney and Vaughn storyline is laid to rest well.  Beyond that, rabid fan dissatisfaction may  also be the REAL reason why none of the series heavy-hitters provided commentary for the final episodes in the Season 5 DVD's.<br /><br />All this shouldn't come as a surprise... J.J. Abrams is notorious for commiting mass character assassination/genocide in the twilight days of his stories which is why (after Alias) I'll never watch another show he produces.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: DUE TO CONSUMER OUTRAGE OVER THEIR DISC DAMAGING DEFECTIVE PRODUCT PACKAGING BUENA VISTA IS NOW REPLACING THE DISCS OF THIS SET FREE OF CHARGE...

B00005JNS0|5.0|I loved this movie so so so much. I have invited my in-laws and my mother over to see it and they loved it. It has such a great message and a joy to watch, Thank you Disney!
B0000399WI|5.0|This film is definitely one of favorite films and I feel one of the greatest films of all times. My wife and I love watching it over and over. We watch it about once a month and we never tire of watching it. A definite must see for anyone.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|When A crow left of the murder came out, it kind of split incubus fans. Morning View gained a lot of fans because of its softer radio friendly songs. When A crow came out, it was very frantic, energetic and just a new direction for the band. I personally liked it. It was a solid cd, with only 3 songs I really didn't like. If you liked that cd, you'll most likely enjoy this one. Its almost like every type of sound Incubus has tried over the years is on this disk. <br /> <br />Quicksand- An opener and not a real song IMO. I dont really like openers that are more than a minute long. Why not make it a real song to begin with? Very spacy and noisy. (4/10) <br /> <br />A Kiss To Send Us Off- Now this is an opener. A great, megalomaniac style song that is really great. Probably my favorite on the cd (10/10) <br /> <br />Dig- Another great song. Its a slower song, and it actually could be on make yourself. Its a great song, and probably will be a single. (9/10) <br /> <br />Anna Molly- The first single. Its a good song. Its different than anything incubus has ever done. A typical incubus song- (8/10) <br /> <br />Love Hurts- At first I really didnt like this song, but its grown on me. The guitars are great on this song, and the ending is very nice. It's the second single, and although I would have chosen something else, the song is still pretty good. (7/10) <br /> <br />Light Grenades- Possibly the heaviest and fastest song Incubus has ever done. Brandon spurts out words so fast I couldnt tell you more than a couple words in this song without looking at the lyrics. The song is short but sweet. (8/10) <br /> <br />Earth To Bella Part 1- Now, I really like the beginning of this song. It starts off with promise but it never really has a chorus and never really amounts to much. It kind of gets built up and fizzles. Too bad, it could have been great. I feel like the songs potential was wasted on breaking it into 2 parts. (5/10) <br /> <br />Oil and Water- A gem. This song is very catchy and its one of my favorites on the album. It starts off with a catchy guitar and ends with Brandon yelling \\"Lets just call it what it is. Oil and Water.\\" The ending is great and almost sounds like a U2 song. (9/10) <br /> <br />Diamonds and Coal- My least favorite on the cd. This song is just so bland and boring. Brandon sings \\"Even diamonds start as coal\\" like 20 times. Its just so average for Incubus. (3/10) <br /> <br />Rogues- Another short and sweet song like Light Grenades. Its a little longer and not as heavy, but it has a good chorus. A pretty standout track on the album- (8/10) <br /> <br />Paper Shoes- The first thing I could think of while listening to this song was that it sounded almost like a Radiohead song. There are various beeps and beats in this song, along with the guitar solo near the middle that is very radiohead-ish. Its a slow song, but I like it. (7/10) <br /> <br />Pendulous Threads- A great \\"Closer\\" to the album. The last great hard rock song on the cd. It feels almost like the Sick Sad Little World of Light Grenades. Its longer than 5 minutes and has a very long guitar solo in the middle just like Sick sad little world. I really like this song. The chorus is unique and the backing vocals are very cool. (9/10) <br /> <br />Earth to Bella part 2- Picks up where part 1 left off, but to be honest, I prefer part one more. This part just doesn't succeed. It fizzles out even more than the first part. I was really disappointed with the two parts. Again, it should have been one epic song with an actual bridge and chorus. Too bad. Maybe live they will play both parts back to back. <br /> <br />Overall, a good effort from the band. 1 or 2 more quality songs could have made it great.
6305132984|5.0|Outstanding Cinematography, Choreography and Musical Score. A story of \\"forbidden\\" love and cultural differences that should be seen by all. Superb cast, especially Natalie Wood and Rita Moreno. The Academy Award winner for Best Motion Picture of 1961, this film ages extremely well with time.
B000GRUS22|5.0|This CD is great, I have listened it many times since I bought it and I don't get tired of the sounds, they're just enchanting. And I would say that Enigma is back again, because the previous CD (Voyeaur) was a little different from the others but it's good though and  this one I'd would say that it's Enigma again. All the music is fantastic and my favorite ones are: Message from IO and The Alchemist. I really recommend this soundtrack, it's worthwhile.
B00005JPCA|5.0|It is always very honest to admit that I thought myself Danny Craig isn't not even sleightly matching for the James Bond part. I was terrible wrong. <br />Ok, he's is not this very handsome, attractive english man like Pierce, but so what. Where is it written in Flemings books that James Bond is a handsome model who could work for Versace or Hugo Boss?? <br /> <br />Bond is an assassin, a cold blooded killer, who is very well trained, has the right dry wit humour, the menace, is very mean (if he has), he relies more on his instinct and crosses more than one time the line (Hello Jack Bauer). <br /> <br />In addition: <br />Casino Royale is a very good, entertaining (even with its length) action-filled cinematic experience with some shocks and laughs (the torture scene, the train dialogue, the staircase fight) and more other things. <br /> <br />Best of all: The parcour chase scene at the beginning ans of course the Poker Game at Casino Royale. A little farfetched again, the scene where Bond takes the poison and coming back to life with the help of Vesper. <br /> <br />But all in all, especially the ending is worth the money. <br /> <br />Welcome back, James.  <br /> <br />jw
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Having seen the Original Theatrical Superman II release many times on DVD, I was hoping for something new with this version. I wasn't disappointed. Despite over 30 years in mothballs, there was just enough Donner footage on the cutting room floor and in archives to complete this otherwise \\"incomplete story\\". The extra scenes with Christopher Reeve show some of the most emotional acting of his characters in the Superman series. This version is a treasure! For its ability to \\"fill in the blanks\\" of the original Theatrical version, and in true fashion following what we would expect from a Director's Cut, I feel it deserves 5-Stars.
0393061434|5.0|My son, a computer geek, recommended iWoz.

0805066691|5.0|I read this book when it was first published and here it is 2006, some 30 years later, and I think of how much it has influenced my world view over the years. My grandmother of English descent provided care to 30 orphan Indian children. When I was a child the Columbia River Gorge, near where I grew up, was still a wild river, not plugged up with hydro dams as it is now. We'd go buy salmon from the Indians at Celilo Falls. We went to the Pendleton Round-up every fall and watched as these people and their festivities--the tipis, dogs, and horses--took over the town alongside the cowboys. My school gave field trips, riding the train to Toppenish to visit the Indians living there. Going back further, one of my great grandmothers was an acquaintance of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce.<br /><br />As a child, I could see a lot of dignity and pride in these people around me, but also a heck of a lot of hurt. As time went on and their presence in my life slipped away because of our modern blandification and the destruction of the natural habitat in which they they sustained themselves, I sort of removed them from my consciousness. The members of the tribes that I knew as a child--primarily Cayuse--are just not around me anymore since I moved. I know there are other indigenous American peoples around me here in California that have also been homogenized into our culture. I sometimes recognize their distinct features.<br /><br />When the American Indian Movement took over Alcatraz, my wife and I donated food and blankets for their cause. So I've always had a heart for these people. My paternal grandmother was part Cherokee as well, so maybe that's where my affinity for them comes from.<br /><br />When I read this book, I remember feeling a new pain inside of me that lasted for months and then I grew angry. The anger turned to a deep mistrust of the \\"system\\", mixed in with a little fear. This has been an unconscious, inexpressible value for me for a long time, as though I've been haunted. When I learned to stoop under my desk as a child in the 1950s and was told by my teacher to pretend that the Soviets were about to destroy everything, when I was challenged by the SS System to go to Vietnam or go to jail, I learned at an experiential level to be mistrustful. What this book did for me, then, was to validate my feelings.<br /><br />I've visited the Winchester Mystery Mansion in San Jose several times over the years. Sarah Winchester inherited the fortune made from Winchester rifles, the gun of choice for killing native Americans. Sarah had seances in her mansion to keep the ghosts of the dead victims of the rifles from haunting her. A lot of the land of the natives has also obviously been built over with McMansions. I wonder whether the new mansions are an attempt to soothe our subconscious, national guilt.<br /><br />Read this book.

His chest insignia is sort of a 3Dish plaque pasted on his uniform. Slightly protruding as is his ding-a-ling. Protruding, that is. <br />  Come on. This dark Gothic production design is fine for Batman. This is Superman. The color photography just does'nt fit. He super swishes in flight or hangs and twirls in mid-air.   <br />  Brandon Routh is fine as Superman. <br />  Frank Langella is a great Perry White. <br />  Kate Bosworth is a nice Lois Lane. Her wardrobe ensemble is atrocious. <br />  Sam Huntington is an excellent Jimmy Olsen. <br />  But the charismatic interplay between these characters is severely lacking and a bit cold. <br />  Kevin Spacey is passable as Lex Luthor but give the guy some decent dialogue that should be campy and bordering on insanity. <br />  Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski is absolutely terrific. A wonderful job of comic relief and just plain funny stuff.  <br />  The dog!!!! Where did the dog come from? Queequeg. Snatched fom the home of Dana Scully on the X-Files? <br />  The Marlon Brando bit borders on forecasts of the Messiah coming. <br />  The whole atmoshere of this film is depressing and it should'nt be. <br />  The visual and special effects are superior as is the score. <br />  SPOILER ALERT <br />  The \\"i'll be around\\" finale is very poor. <br />  And the grand finale. Well....at least Christopher Reeve gave us a wink and a smile. <br />  \\"GREAT CAESARS' GHOST\\". This coulda been so good. <br />
0452282152|4.0|The great artists always could make it look easy. Picasso, Charlie Parker, Monk, Ellington, Ted Williams, Groucho, Como, Kingsolver, Bill Clinton, to name a few. Then you look closer. With the proper knowledge and the appropriate measuring devices, you discover that there is much more there there. What appears to be white on closer inspection turns out to be ocher, lead-tin yellow, ultramarine, red lake and even carbon black. What seems simple is really quite extraordinary, like hitting a two seam fast ball coming at you at 95 miles per hour, or playing an equally convincing Stanley Kowalski, Vito Corleone, or Richard III. As Picasso once said,  the more technique there is, the less there is. Put another way, making it look easy, doesn't mean that it is. John Coletrane famously practiced musical scales every day. Not just to warm up. He practiced scales, or variations of scales, for eight hours a day. Eight Hours! Every Day. The Reason? His Answer: Basics man, you need to master the basics, always go back to the basics. So it is with Tracy Chevalier. Her portrait appears oh so simple. But look closer. Use the proper microscope and you will see how her early words and ideas serve as the foundation colors for the picture that emerges. How'd the young Tracy Chevalier get such skills? The same way Coletrane got to Carneige Hall. Practice, Man. Practice.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjork is totally experimental and there's absolutely no one like her. Post is a series of letters sent to her homeland iceland while she was exploring city life, this is the concept behind the album, although it's not a conceptual album per se. Electronic, orchestral, percussive and of course her unmistakable voice in one wonderful and exhilirating sonic journet through creativity at it's peak!
B000HIVO64|2.0|If another artist put out this album I might have liked it more. But since it is Beck (the expectations being high) I'm being generous with two stars. 1000 beats per second is the worst song ever put out by Beck. <br /> <br />All the tracks on this album are redundant and they don't progress. They simply don't have any movement at all. His songs used to be more unpredictable and evolving. These tracks upset me because I love Beck. <br /> <br />My only theory on Beck's downward spiral is because he became a Scientologist and they sucked out his soul or something. It can't be a coincidence that after Sea Change he became a Scientologist. Hopefully his next album is better. He needs to break up with his girlfriend again. <br />
B000I5X81K|2.0|I loved Groban's first CD.  His second CD was almost as good, but not quite. This one really misses the mark.  The songs lack passion.  One of the songs sounds like he's got a cold.  At least one song is so full of falsetto that he sounds horribly off key.  Most of the songs are just boring to listen to because he sounds bored singing them.  The title of the CD, \\"Awake\\" is listed as a \\"bonus\\" track.  How does that make any sense?!?  What a contrast from the passion and energy of his first CD.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Okay, when I first saw the trailer for this movie I was excited.  I consider myself a green person and I am always interested in learning more about how I can have a positive impact on the planet.  Unfortunately, Al Gore is what the movie is about.  Yeah, he spouts off all kinds of facts about temperatures and former glaciers but it seems to me that there are some pretty irrelevant things pertaining to his own life in there.  First off, I really don't care that he lost the presidency, yeah so it was a \\"big blow\\" to him, what does that have to do with global warming?  Second, thanks for taking us to your childhood farm(?).  Seriously, these bits turned me right off.  As you can see my title is \\"The father of the Internet right?\\" and as many of you know he has proclaimed his \\"hand\\" in the invention/rise of the Internet (forget the scientists).  I just feel like this guy is too easy to spot as one of \\"those\\" politicians.
B000JBXXZ4|1.0|WOW. I cannot help to feel just a little bit disappointed. I have listened to this album over and over, minute by minute, second by second....nothing....I have enjoyed incubus since Fungus Amongus and although they have changed DJs, bass players, and discovered vocal classes over the years, they maintained the \\"Rock\\" culture. \\"Light Grenades\\" cannot be appreciated by a fan who has seen Incubus during \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E\\" and \\"Make Yourself\\" tours. There isn't much flow amongst vocals, guitar, percussion, drums, etc. The album is all over the place, and it bothers me to say it. \\"Anna Molly\\" is going to be just another Pop Rock hit, but the album, like the others, does not have much to offer after that. I enjoy \\"A Kiss to Send us Off,\\" \\"Rogues,\\" and \\"Paper Shoes\\" because they closely resemble the Incubus I love - excellent rhythm, flow, beat changes, and jam sessions (maybe Diamonds and Coal).  <br /> <br />Each of their previous 4 albums I can listen to completely without skipping around. Yes, I will buy a concert ticket, but only because it's Incubus. I gave the album 1 star only because I enjoyed their previous 4 LPs.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|I received the movie from Amazon yesterday and watched right away. My expectations for it were moderate, so I wasn't too disappointed. I was hoping that some scenes that had really bothered me in the Lester version would be gone entirely, and indeed some were. (Warning: some light spoilers): <br /> <br />1- My biggest gripe was the scene on the moon: in the Lester version, the villains talk normally in a supposedly airless environment (despite the obvious absence of gravity) and then some wind is fluttering through their clothes as they fly off towards earth. There is less wind-fluttering in the Donner version, but the talking in space is still there.  <br /> <br />2- The scene where Clark admits his secret identity is a lot more comical and 'cute' here than the Lester version, although this is probably one of the longest scenes that are based on rehearsals and not actual shooting (one can tell by the bad lighting and shadows in the background).  <br /> <br />3- I was glad to see the needless special effects Superman undergoes during his exposure to red sunlight go away. I also missed the Eiffel Tower scene, which has been replaced in this movie by extended scenes from Superman I. But it didn't break the flow of this version at all, and the absence of this scene is very understandable. <br /> <br />4- There are a lot more emotional undertones in this version between father and son (now that the scenes with Brando have been restored). It makes a nice background to the spirituality we see in the recent 'Superman Returns'. It was interesting to see a more heated exchange between father and son as opposed to submissive respect between mother and son in the Lester version. Some have complained that Brando's scenes are unnecessarily long: I disagree, I think they are just right and add a greater degree of depth to the film. However, the editing itself seems a little out-of-pace, with scenes of Superman's dinner with Lois in the Fortress (minus the scene where Superman flies to some tropical island to gather fresh fruit and flowers; that's gone) going back and forth with scenes of the Zod gang's wreaking of havoc elsewhere. In fact, this back and forth pacing makes this part of the movie move along a lot faster than before. I do agree that having the sex scene (minus the part where he leads her by hand to his space-crib, which is also gone) before the molecule chamber scene doesn't make as much sense as the reverse, but oh well.  <br /> <br />5- The ending (as described in another review) did not sit well with me. The Lester amnesia kiss never really did either, but I'd probably prefer the kiss to Donner's ending. This ending introduces a lot of logic/plot flaws, and becomes inconsistent with scenes from both 'Superman IV' and 'Superman Returns' (especially the latter) - or does it? That we are left wondering at all is part of how the ending mars the movie to a certain extent.  <br /> <br />All in all, a fine alternative version with a few flaws of its own, including one (towards the end) that tragically alters the consistency with later movies and is also rather unnecessary. 3 out of 5 stars.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot is not the kind of band that will appeal to everyone. If you're sitting comfortably at the top of the social pyramid with american eagle collared shirts and k-swiss shoes then this album is definetly not for you. This album is for the quiet, social outcasts that wear only black band t-shirts. This is a very dark album but it relates perfectly to losers and loners. This is not the best slipknot album musically, but the raw anger and hatred is without out a doubt the purpose of the album. Joey Jordison is in my opinion the best drummer in today's music and i think that in a couple years down the road he could definetly be considered one of the top 5 best drummers of all time.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Being a huge Superman fan I immediately ordered this and just watched it. Great memories, I must say!  Im going to try and review this by breaking down the differences and improvements. I will also throw some criticisms out there as well since nothing is perfect!  Most fans have seen the movie and a straight-up review is uneccessary so here goes with my \\"take\\" on all of it:    IMPROVEMENTS / UPGRADES / ADDITIONS:    - New scene involving Lois trying to prove Clark is Superman. Different location, same result, but still better overall, IMO.    - A SECOND scene involving Lois trying to solve the Clark/Superman mystery that totally caught me offguard and probably you too!    - A little more Lois and Clark dialog that built up their relationship nicely.    - More Jorell scenes and much better dialog between Jorell and his Son. A few reviewers disliked the extra Jorell footage and I cant see why. This footage built the relationship between the father and son much better than the matter-of-fact Lester version. They were great additions if you're into the story a little more. Plus, it is much more revealing about how Superman has to regain his powers after forfeiting them to be with Lois. Plus, the Lester version uses Supermans mother for the Fortress scenes. That was lame.... nothing against Mom, but in a situation like that the Dad is the right choice here and the Donner version restores the Brando stuff. Lester's Fortress scenes are cheapened badly because of this and it hurts the Lester film, IMO.    - Fight scenes with the 3 villians and Superman were slightly different and a little longer. The villians received a little more screen time and some of their footage on the moon, the White House, etc, etc, were slightly longer. I liked it better for the most part.    - Removal of some horribly dorky things that I was glad to see go. Other reviews have also pointed these out but lemme just summarize that most of the \\"kiddie\\" humor or action sequences are gone. Thank you Mr. Donner! For example, the roller skating \\"Whah.....\\" guy is gone. The wig lady is gone during the villains \\"blowing hot air at the civilians\\" scene.     - Nice opening scenes with some flashback combined with new footage of how the villians got to Earth and some of their initial journey.    BAD STUFF / DIDNT LIKE IT    - The ending.... like others have said, it was somewhat of a cop-out.    - A few of the glaringly obvious screen test scenes that had to be used.  It felt like I was watching two different movies when these scenes were matched with more current footage.    - A few continuity issues, especially at the end of the film.  One scene in particular occurs at Niagara Falls where Lois takes Clarks glasses off due to foggy lenses...remember that? Well, with the new added footage, her reaction to seeing him with glasses off doesnt make sense at the time of that scene.  You'll see. Clarks behavior here doesnt make sense either due to the new footage shown prior to this scene.    - I would have liked to see some of the special effects touched up more in spots, but you cant have everything.    Overall, this was a GREAT film and Im very happy I have it and very pleased that the poeple who made it happen made it happen.  I do like Lesters version as well and it has its own merits. However, with a deeper storyline and mostly the right additions and subtractions, this is the version that I prefer. By all means you must see it if you are a fan.  Some people will like it and some wont and you'll have to use your own mind to make a decision. I personally LIKE slowing things down a bit and learning more about characters in movies.  Others dont, and the Lester version is slightly quicker-paced.    I recommend this version to any Superman fans...its damned good overall!
B000JJS8TM|3.0|... but this work is more of a reflection of the Martin's abilities to rework Beatles music than it is of the Beatles themselves. <br /> <br />The artists on this release should be Sir George and Giles Martin, not the Beatles. <br /> <br />This is akin to the Let It Be album, which (sadly)is more reflective of Phil Spector's producing abilities than of the Beatles' music.  Thank the powers-that-be that the \\"naked\\" version was released a few years ago so it could be heard how it was meant to be heard.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Ok, in my humble opinion, this cd shows why the Beatles are the greatest rock band in history.  The way the songs are intersperced is sheer genius. <br /> <br />GREAT CD!!
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|To give you a good idea of where I am coming from, I will tell you that I could not stand A Crow Left of the Murder nor Morning View.  I thought they were pop-trash, phoned-in attempts at best.  Sure, there were some standout tracks, but overall they failed to impress me.  Before Tuesday Incubus was a band that showed all the tell-tale signs of fame.  The music got simpler.  The lyrics got dumber.  My faith was trampled.  These weren't the same guys that gave us energized punk, funk rock/metal.  This wasn't the same band that followed a refreshing sound with a superb rock album known as Make Yourself.  Nope.  These guys were MTV. <br /> <br />Now, I think the easiest way for die-hard fans to make excuses for bands, is to use the overused term, \\"growth\\".  Honestly, I really believe the true meaning of this term in this context has been completely lost.  A few negative reviews will poor in and the fans will attack like vultures.  \\"Um, they sound different dummy because they are growing\\".  Blech.  Give me a break!  Just changing a sound, is not growth.  Interestingly, when you consider bands that aren't mainstream, changing a sound envokes revolt.  That band is accused of \\"selling out\\", however when a pop band changes their sound it's defended tooth and nail as \\"growth\\".  I am all for growth, but not if it means restructuring ideals and the basics.  The differences between A Crow Left of the Murder and S.C.I.E.N.C.E. are so extreme, many would be hard pressed to believe it's the same band.  Incubus hasn't grown, but they've definitely reinvented and I don't think reinvention is always a positive thing. <br /> <br />With that, I can tell you that I really believe Incubus has embraced the basics and delivered an album closer to their roots with Light Grenades.  This sounds like growth.  This album sounds like it should have followed Make Yourself.  Unfortunately, it's not perfect; some tracks are awkward, some don't resemble originality in the slightest, but as a whole the band seems to have recognized what they are good at. <br /> <br />I think it's safe to say that Incubus has been and will always be good at upbeat, creative rock.  Fungous Amongous, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself was filled with it.  Morning View lacked anything with promise and Crow had a few, but in the most boring way imagineable.  Finally, they revive their funkiness and spirit to deliver a few quick-paced, energetic tunes on Light Grenades.  Honestly, it was such a relief for a fan such as myself, because not only do I think they excel at it, but I think it's what Incubus really is. <br /> <br />There are slower songs and I believe they are mostly pretty good.  They have enough variety and creativity thrown in to keep it fresh.  The downfall with these songs is that they are mostly uninspired love songs and some tend to be so unoriginal I wonder if it was really Incubus performing it.  The second half of the album flirts with the sound of Red Hot Chili Peppers so often it scares me, but luckily enough freshness and the bands signature sound comes through enough to set the two bands apart. <br /> <br />I see some reviews saying there is too much filler, the album is too short and the songs \\"Earth to Bella\\" are unecessary additions.  For the most part, I disagree.  Even though the sound on the second half of the album is dangerously unoriginal, there is still enough good work there to discount any of the tracks being filler.  The album really isn't all that short.  The industry standard is an 11-12 track album with songs clocking in at 3 minutes.  Light Grenades is 13 tracks long with the songs just under 4 minutes on average for an album 47:44 in length.  If anything, it's above average.  If people really think the album is too short, then maybe they are enjoying it more than they think.  \\"Earth to Bella\\" is a weird inclusion on the album.  I don't believe it's bad persay, but I hate the choice of splitting it up.  I think it should have remained intact asone track.  The break is awkward and doesn't lend itself to any real point.  I don't know why they split it.  The frustrating thing for me is that the outro and intro to these \\"two\\" songs is unbelievably promising.  It would lend itself well if extended as a bridge into an utterly trash-out song. <br /> <br />Also, quick note.  Quicksand sounds nothing like Pink Floyd as many have said.  I think the song is undeniably inspired by Deftones.  Brandon's vocal in the first half of the song are almost identical to Chino Moreno. <br /> <br />So many people have gotten into specifics, so I kind of avoided that.  I guess that doesn't make this much a review.   If you are unsure what my thoughts are, then here's my summary:  this album is good.  And if you didn't like the previous two albums, it's likely you will find this one more accessible and Incubus-friendly.  It's not flawless, but it's a step in the right direction.  I don't think we will ever get a S.C.I.E.N.C.E. rehash and that's fine.  I just wish the band would look closer at what has worked well on all previous albums and mesh that together.  This was close, but not quite.  Luckily, the band has renewed my faith in them and I will continue to support their career. <br /> <br />Older fans will love A Kiss to Send Us Off, Light Grenades and the Hendrix-inspired Pendulous Threads. <br /> <br />Newer fans will embrace Anna Molly, Diamonds and Coal and Dig.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|I much prefer the A&E/BBC version of this movie. You may like this version if you are a Paltrow or Northam fan.
0380789035|2.0|Neil Gaiman is probably one of the best plot writters for comics and graphical novels in english language. Also is a great writter and reader of tales. Disgracefully, it seems that his abilities are not yet rippe enough for a true novel.<br /><br />Altough \\"American Gods\\" has many entretaining details, and is fun, it is not really a novel, but more like the plot of a giant comic nobody ever draw. It lacks the rithm and complexity of a novel, specially one which pretends to be 300 pages long. I believe Gaiman has still to mature to be able to write this kind of works. I recommend the readers to keep adquiring his works in comics and short tales, where he is superb, until he shows refinament in his plots.
B00005JPCD|3.0|Upon returning home from a fishing expedition, Norma Jean (Kidman, an Emperor penguin, meets her baby boy Mumble (Wood).  He is a little strange.  While all Emperor penguins like to sing, Mumble likes to dance.  He also sings really, really badly.  Feeling like an outcast, he leaves his group of penguins and becomes friends with Ramon (Williams), a penguin of a different species who does not mind Mumble's \\"Happy Feet\\".  With the help of his new friends, he sets out to figure out why the fish supply has decreased, a problem that threatens all the life on Antarctica. <br /> <br />\\"Happy Feet\\" could have been a really good movie.  Lots of singing, cute penguins, and a nice story about how being different is not bad.  But, in the last third of the movie, it all falls apart.  A conservationalist message is handled with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the head.  The way it is handled feels out of place in a kids' movie, and has a different and darker tone from the rest of the film.  Also, a dues ex machina to save the day for Mumbles feels like a big old cheat.  The last third of the movie actually made me dislike this film a lot, and I cannot recommend it to anyone. <br />
B00005JPCD|4.0|***1/2<br /><br />Two emperor penguins, Memphis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman), meet through song. This isn't unusual in their community; the penguins spend much of their childhood going to school to learn how to sing for this is the way they attract a mate. Memphis and Norma Jean's egg is held by Dad during the winter, as Mom and the other females trek to the water, to feed and bring back food for their husbands and newborns. Memphis is a little upset when his egg doesn't hatch at the same time, but Mumble soon breaks through the shell. It quickly becomes apparent Mumble is no ordinary emperor penguin; his voice can cause glass to break, but he can dance. As Mumble grows older, he earns the nickname Happy Feet (Eiljah Wood) and becomes attracted to another penguin named Gloria (Brittany Murphy). But Mumble's dancing is unusual and scares the elders (led by Hugo Weaving) and his dancing is blamed for the lack of fish. Happy Feet decides he will venture forth and find the real cause of the lack of fish, as he learns of `Aliens', from Lovelace (Robin Williams), a leader of a different breed of penguins. Soon, he discovers an abandoned outpost built by humans.<br /><br />\\"Happy Feet\\", directed by George Miller (\\"Mad Max\\", \\"Babe\\") is a surprisingly enjoyable film.<br /><br />The animation is simply stunning. Every penguin is different and appears lifelike and real. As Mumble grows older, he is the one penguin in his group who still appears young, as though his adolescence is taking longer than normal. His feathers gradually recede throughout, giving him the appearance of growing, when all of his friends have already matured. This is yet another way he stands out and is made to feel different from the rest.<br /><br />There is a lot of music in \\"Happy Feet\\" and the animators have done a great job of making the penguins appear to be actually singing. Their tongues move in their open beaks and their movements appear both penguin-like and evocative of the words they are singing. The marriage of music and animation is very effective and brought to mind \\"Moulin Rouge\\"; \\"Feet\\" uses the same sort of popular songs in an unexpected context to tell parts of the story. Memphis (Jackman), has a bit of an Elvis persona, and sings songs in that same manner. Norma Jean (Kidman) is more the chanteuse, singing 70s rock ballads to attract her mate. Gloria (Murphy) is a modern girl, in more the Pink/ Cristina Aguilera mode and sings more modern songs. As each character begins singing, the rest of the penguins around them are so overcome by the melody, they join in creating a defacto chorus, singing along, mimicking the moves, etc.<br /><br />There are a couple of really nice sequences throughout \\"Happy Feet\\". At one point, Mumble and his friends are dancing and singing and then start swimming and the sequence evolves into a choreographed Busby Berkley/ Esther Williams-esque homage, everyone begins to swim in synchronized movements, swirling in circles around other swimmers. All of this is fun to watch and the animation is simply stunning and very fluid, reminiscent of the live action footage in \\"March of the Penguins\\".<br /><br />Later, Mumble and some of his friends, the different breed of penguins with Spanish accents, are swimming through the water, trying to evade a giant leopard seal. Again, great animation because it is so fluid and believable as they dart in and under stone arches, past underwater rock formations, and through tunnels.<br /><br />It is also fun to watch Mumble dance. He lets the rhythm take over and his feet begin tapping and doing a soft shoe. Famed dancer Savion Glover actually did the dancing for Mumble and his signature style is very recognizable, lots of tapping and sliding feet back and forth. They filmed Glover actually dancing, using Motion Capture technology. When they animated Mumble, Glover's feet and movements were copied and computers were used to animate the penguin's dance steps. It is a little more complicated than that, but you get the idea.<br /><br />The voice characterizations are good, but not great. Jackman seems to have the most fun with his character, giving him a discernible feel and accent. Kidman is also good and she imbues Norma Jean with a wispy, `bombshell' like voice. Eiljah Wood is less successful as Mumble and Brittany Murphy's Gloria could have been done by any other young female actress. Her voice is very recognizable, but she does little to make the character unique.<br /><br />Robin Williams provides three voices. The first is Lovelace, the leader of the smaller breed of penguins. Slightly overweight and full of bombast, he knows his place in the world and wants to keep his kingdom intact. But he is most successful with Ramon, the leader of the five penguins who tag along with Happy Feet during his journey. Using a Spanish accent, the character is funny and provides some comic relief along the way. A third voice only makes a brief appearance.<br /><br />\\"Happy Feet\\" attempts to make a statement about the effects of the environment on these animals; the lack of fish for the penguins is causing problems and the elders naturally suspect the unusual new moves Happy Feet is making. But Happy Feet learns of strange beings, \\"aliens\\", from Lovelace and suspects they may be the cause. Shunned by his community, he sets out on a quest. Without revealing too much, examples of human influences on the penguins are shown, but the course of Happy Feet's journey is strange. He has some interactions with humans, but the end result is not convincing. All of a sudden, the mere presence of the penguin leads many humans to make sweeping, world wide environmental changes.<br /><br />In the last act, when Happy Feet comes into contact with humans, we actually see some of these people. I can't figure out if director Miller used just live action footage or if he filmed real actors and then treated it in some way. The humans appear realistic, but slightly soft, almost ghost like. It is an interesting look. But at the same time, the introduction of such realistic human elements makes \\"Happy Feet\\" resemble one of those live action Disney nature films made in the 60s and 70s, where a human scientist makes a brief appearance watching the lion cubs on the veldt.<br /><br />\\"Happy Feet\\" is an enjoyable, fun film for the whole family.

B000J10EQU|4.0|Considering it came & went without much celebration, this was a better movie than I was expecting it to be.  Not great but not middle of the road either.  Make no mistake about: the most thrilling scene was the first transformation into Superman, his rescue of a Lois Lane-carrying plane & her & the world's priceless reaction.  As for the rest of the movie: <br /> <br />Routh was scary good as Clark, sounding just like Reeves in spots.  Bosworth's performance as Lois was better than I'd been led to believe.  If you have a problem with it, blame the writer. Kate acted the role as it was written.  I'm not sure where they plan on taking the character of the kid in the sequel (who`s not who you originally think) but I'll be watching.  Spacey made a good Lex too. <br /> <br />Having said all that, I really wish they'd made more of a clean start, instead of making it a sequel to Superman 2 (ignoring 3 & 4).  I had no problem with them not wanting to redo Superman's early years or with the long-term absence of Superman.  But I would've liked to have seen them stay truer to the comics (both parents alive etc..)  & make Lex more of a hands-off villian, the kind that the good guys know is behind everything but are never able to catch him with his hand in the cookie jar.
B000F39MAQ|5.0|I make great use of customer's reviews when purchasing DVDs from Amazon, and I confess I got no guidance from the reviews on this product. They seemed to be split between rabidly pro-Villazon supporters, and traditionalists who don't like change. I purchased anyway, since I was interested in seeing these two young performers, Netrebko and Villazon, both of whom I have heard on CD. <br /> <br />I am so glad I did. This is a stunning performance! <br /> <br />I have the ROH/Solti/Gheorgiu DVD and I love it. I have spent hours listening to both, and I am gradually coming down more in favour of this Salzburg recording, mainly because of the performance by the two leads. I say performance deliberately, because the acting is every bit as good as the singing. The big difference between Covent Garden and Salzburg is Alfredo. Netrebko can hold her own with Gheorgiu, but Villazon is special. Thomas Hampson is fine, but this is the youngsters' show. <br /> <br />The production is not my ideal, but it works. The criticisms raised by others have some validity, but are circumstantial. Why argue about the validity of Germont's motive for breaking up the relationship; it's the fact of the break-up, and the unfairness of it, that matters. <br /> <br />Changing the period is often problematical. The sets and costumes are there to remind our lazy brains of the circumstances in which the drama unfolds, and we do need to keep in mind the circumstances of life in the period in which the opera is set, to understand mythology, witchcraft, curses, religious persecution, and, of course, the concept of honour.  <br /> <br />With this performance, you will be so enthralled with the drama and music, that criticism of the period setting becomes petty carping. <br /> <br />Buy, and enjoy! <br /> <br />
B000J10EQU|1.0|just finished watching this movie on DVD.  Based on the many negative comments from the clientele that frequent my local comic book store I didn't want to spend the money on the movie and waited for the DVD.  All I can say is boring, boring, boring. <br /> <br />I can't believe that a character with millions of interesting stories written about him would sadly have so many talented people including, director, writers, FX staff and actors come up with the lamest most boring production ever.  I was actually dozing off through the middle of the movie.  The TV show, Smallville, has taken liberties with the Superman mythos which has made the show more interesting.  The liberties taken with this movie:  Lois Lane with a kid and a fiancee served only to slow down the plot. Yeah, having Lois Lane drag her unkept, shy kid with inhaler problems around the office and on the job really made for some exciting \\"comic book moments\\"   Even the issue of Superman returning five years later was never explored and didn't add anything to the plot.  It only made us question the age of  Superman and Lois five years ago.  Seventeen?  They both look like they should still be in college.  <br /> <br /> Tom Welling, supposedly the \\"young Superman\\" in Smallville has more maturity, confidence, intelligence, actually more acting skills than most of the actors in this movie.   Dont' waste your money, watch the TV show, or buy the comic books.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|theres not much more i could add to what mostly everyone else has said in their reviews.  i purchased mine recently and have watched every night since. amazing stuff, i found the video and audio to be just fine. i like kiss just the way they were warts and all. grainy video less than surround sound audio? rock and roll was not meant to be perfect. the houston 77 show was amazing, wish i could have been there. the bonus disc included was madison square garden 77. not the best audio or video but very entertaining none the less. my first kiss show was at madison square garden for the dynasty tour. even the packaging is really nice, theres a cool little book and an old school patch sticker. whether a serious kiss devotee or a casual fan you will enjoy something in this set. on kiss web site there is mention of other sets coming out in the near future. sounds great to me. kiss really is the best.
0316286850|5.0|If you're seriously into makeup or if you're curious about what it can do to transform someone's face, Kevyn Aucoin's books are The Source, hands down. He gives plenty of tips on how to achieve various looks (in this one and in Face Forward), and the results are amazing. He goes over various looks, and offers advice how to get these looks (whether you want smoky eyes or poutier lips, or you want some kind of 1950s or 1960s look, or something totally fresh and modern). He explains brow shapes, eyeliner styles, lipstick application styles, applying blush, concealer, you name it. It's a makeup bible. And on top of that he does some amazing makeovers, of unknown women and famous women. To see Lisa Marie Presley transformed into Marilyn Monroe or Julia Roberts transformed into Julie Christie ala \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" is amazing to see. And that's just the tip of the lipstick iceberg. There are a lot of other transformations, some familiar looks and some all his own creations, and they're all astounding and beautiful. He's great with showing how to play with looks that make you look like you, only better, but also he's great in making you open your eyes to new looks and combinations.   The only bad thing -- actually it's tragic -- is that Kevyn died some years ago and we'll never get anymore books from him (though A Beautiful Life is a great retrospective, too, and there's his first, The Art of Makeup). And he took a lot of the pictures in the books, so it shows what an amazing photographer he was. There'll never be another one like Mr. Aucoin, but at least there are four books showcasing his amazing and timeless magical ways with makeup.
0786886811|4.0|I completely ignored the marketing for this book, not even the television program influenced me to pick it up.  I only bought this book and the how to eat book with Feast because of a successful chocolate loaf recipe from her current television program.  Domestic Goddess is a good book.  I recommend it over Feast which uses a lot of recipes from her past books.  I read a recommendation that a cookbook should have at least one good recipe that you like to make repeatedly for it to be a good purchase.  I've made one of the easiest recipes in the book, coconut macaroons. It may not be the best recipe in the book but at least it got me started and sometimes it is hard to get me started.
B000J10ERO|3.0|When I saw that Bryan Singer was going to spearhead the Superman Returns project I was thrilled. Singer lead Marvel's X Men and X2...ummm...marvelously. So turning the helm over to Singer for DC Comic's Superman Returns was a big buzz.<br /><br />Perhaps Singer has been watching too much Smallville? Don't get me wrong, I think that Smallville is excellent. However, with Superman Returns my expectations were not set for a slow moving love story between Superman and Lois Lane...which is what 50% of the movie is; I would expect that kind of filler from Clark and Lana in the TV series Smallville...lot's of episodes to fill.<br /><br />Plus based on how action-oriented Singer's two X Men entries were, I had very high expectations for Superman Returns. The action was indeed good in Superman Returns, but it was predictable. There were no surprises. The special effects were good; the flying looked better than any Superman movie ever. But nothing that made me say out loud, \\"Oh, cooool\\" or \\"That is awesome!\\"<br /><br />And the story really fell flat. In fact, it was almost a re-do of Lex Luthor's quest for real estate in Superman 1. I've seen much better stories in the Justice League animated series than Superman Returns. Much better.<br /><br />Some of the situations in Superman Returns were very far fetched, i.e. (without revealing any spoiling details): Superman crashing via meteor back to earth with no public fanfare; Richard White rescuing Lois in a sea plane; Luthor Waltzing right into the Fortress of Solitude. I'd have liked to have seen more realistic scenarios like the excellent job David Goyer and Chris Nolan did with Batman Begins...just...more realistic.<br /><br />So perhaps Singer should have stuck with X Men 3 and let someone else have Superman Returns...but that is not the way the cookie crumbled. In fact, Singer has signed on for Superman: The Man of Steel scheduled for release in 2009.<br /><br />Brandon Routh was a pretty good Superman preserving the Christopher Reeve portrayal almost mirror image. Kevin Spacey was a good Lex. And Kate Bosworth was a bit young looking for Lois.<br /><br />After saying all this, I didn't think it was a bad movie. It just fell far short of what I expected. And that basically took a smile and turned it upside down.opher Reeve portrayal almost mirror image. Kevin Spacey was a good Lex.

089898890X|5.0|Like Jazz?  Don't like Jazz?  It doesn't matter. Whether you like to swing or not, this book WILL make you a better drummer and musician.  The triplet feel is almost its own dimension in drumming and every drummer should master it. Although it is targeted for bebop jazz (basically faster swing feel as far as a drummer is concerned), this book will give you plenty of exercises and ideas you can incorporate in any genre.  The exercises are great for independence and time-keeping, and offer very, very good fill and solo ideas. <br /> <br />As for aspiring jazz drummers, there is absolutely no question, GET this book.  Any jazz professor at the university level would approve and it is used widely in music schools such as Berklee and Indiana University Music School (I graduated from IU). <br /> <br />The lessons on brushes are crucial and if you have never placed your hand on a brush, here is where you should start looking.   <br /> <br />The accompanying CD is great as well and helps you to master a good swing time, listen to exercises being played, listen to compositions and play along tunes with a bassist or with a whole rhythm section.   <br />
B000002KYK|3.0|I like the other CD better - the original soundtrack with all the vocals fromt he movie. It's a much more wholistic experience. I like that is is more undustrial - the way the movie is. It's sexy and entertaining.  <br />I recommend the original!
B000AYEIZY|5.0|If Cream had been this good all those years ago, they'd have never broken up.  Finally the egos and gone, over and done with; they are playing like a band, not three individuals. <br /> <br />Clapton's playing is the best it's been in years. No seeing how many notes you can squeeze into a line, just good tasteful stuff.  His blues is better than even with John Mayall; take a listen to Stormy Monday. <br />

B00000I9MK|5.0|Plain and simple...Belle & Sebastian is my favorite band and this is, in my opinion, their best album. It's a lush, giddy, stark, springtime-in-headphones, gift of pure beauty and joy. All of their other albums are great in their own right as well.  I would have to say the FYHCYWLAP was my least favorite(if that is possible)until I saw them perform at the Hollywood Bowl this past summer.  Oh my goodness... now I can't get the damn thing out of my player! Check them all out!!!
B0000039QA|5.0|Life After shows Biggie's growth as an artist and man. The storytelling is very cinematic and compelling. This is really a movie on wax for real. The paranoia is also raised on here and for good reason since Biggie spent 1996 fending off Pac's accusations and insults. In short, Biggie was a naturally gifted, personable, smart dude that's greatly missed.    Top Joints:  I Got A Story To Tell  Long Kiss Goodnight  Notorious Thugs  Hypnotize  N*ggas Bleed  Goin Back To Cali  My Downfall  What's Beef  Kick In The Door  You're Nobody.........

0316666343|3.0|The book was okay....but I wish that I hadnt bought it. I think getting it second hand or getting it from the library would have been a better choice for me. I had the book figured out early on and I guess that is why I didnt really care alot for the book.
B000002GFT|5.0|This album is a great example of Fairport Convention making a characteristically British stamp on the emerging genre of folk-rock.  It's comprised mainly of actual folk songs from the isles, but the band takes possession of each song and works it up into rocking, uptempo music that is unique compared with any American folk rock of the time.<br /><br />The album opener, \\"Come All Ye,\\" pretty much lays it out there, introducing the band members and telling the listener that the music is going to get you dancing (or at least swaying) and singing or humming.  What follows are some really progressive folk songs that range from ballads, like the exciting \\"Matty Groves\\" (which, incidentally, rocks pretty hard at the ending instrumental section), the heavy riffing of \\"Tam Lin\\" (which must have been an influence on Jethro Tull), and the tragic \\"Crazy Man Michael,\\" love songs like \\"Farewell, Farewell,\\" and a great instrumental medley.<br /><br />Musically, Sandy Denny's voice is great and the guitar work is a highlight.  They manage to deftly combine acoustic instrumentation and more trippy electric instruments, yet still stay true to the British folk music and stories that underly it all.  I'd recommend this to fans of Tull and Pentangle, but also to folk rock fans of bands like the Byrds and Dylan who are interested in stretching their horizons past American folk and blues to find rewarding folk from across the pond.  Check it out, it's cheap!
B000GRUS22|5.0|The latest Engima album A Posteriori is a natural evolution of Enigma's sounds as Michele Cretu's musical stylings mature.  Smooth and Melodic filled with soft background beats and rythmic guitar rifts that follows in the path of Delerium, Honeyroot, and Royksopp.  I can see why fans of classic enigma works would be dissapointed but i believe the course of which enigma has chosed to go is a good one.  You can only do the same thing for so long before it gets tired and old.  Every musical group that continues refines their style and sound as they go on.  Groups and artists like Pearl Jam, Bjork, Nine Inch Nails, Seal, Moby have all altered their sounds as their careers have gone on.  Sometimes change is good, other times the fans don't like it so what can you do. <br /> <br />for people who didn't like the Voyageur, you may not like A Posteriori as it is sort of a morph between earlier Enigma and Voyageur.   <br /> <br />I think michele cretu should be applauded for seeking out new avenues for his musical stylings, while they aren't the same, they certainly aren't completely different either.  Either way check out A Posteriori and decide for yourself.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|The Beatles recordings have been screaming for high resolution (DVD-Audio 194k) presentation for years, preferrably in the original mono & stereo versions as well as 5.1 mixes.  Certainly that would make nearyl every audiophile Beatles fan a happy camper.  This LOVE release is a mixed bag.  While I applaud the sonics, it is hard to get past some of the combinations and mixings of these classic tunes.  I know, I know...this is for the Cirque du Soleil in Vegas.  But sometimes the sheer magnitude of mixing together two and three Beatles songs in 5.1 tends to be very tiring, sometimes leading into a cacophonous orgy of nearly unintelligible, non-musical sounds.  It is imaginative, and I AM THE WALRUS is glorious.  But I was wasted by the end of the disc.  Now will SOMEONE convince Capitol/EMI, the Beatles and their heirs to FINALLY release those glorious recordings in high resolution original mono, high resolution original stereo and, where appropriate (4 track recordings forward, starting with Sgt. Pepper), 5.1.
B000002UW1|5.0|The most aptly-titled R.E.M. album, this is really, in a nutshell, the mission statement if you will of the band. Using this album as a base of comparison, a person can listen to each of its other albums and get an appropriate read of the test subject's poppiness, or its political tone, or almost whatever angle they want to look at. <br />It's their manifesto, if you will, and the album which (appropriately so) everything after would be compared to due to the fact that it is the album first widely accepted by both the college radio and pop radio communities as well as critics. <br />Starting with the songs (almost) everyone knows, \\"The One I Love\\" and \\"The End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" are staples of classic modern rock, and deservedly so. Michael Stipe could really be singing the alphabet in \\"The One I Love\\" and I wish that people would get over the issue of it begin a misunderstood song. It's the MUSIC and vocal melody of it that made it great. Pete Buck's guitar in that song is likely his most memorable single lick, and the dynamics of the song (from subdued verses to screaming chorus) paved the way for a lot of later pop music by many alt acts (Nirvana in particular). <br />\\"The End of the World...\\" has admittedly devolved over the years into a frat-party favorite, but that's not R.E.M.'s fault. It remains one of the best takes on apocalypse I've ever heard. Bring it on... <br />But as per usual the hits (both real and imagined) aren't the best songs on an R.E.M. album, and they're certainly not the most important ones on Document.  <br />\\"Welcome To The Occupation\\" and \\"Disturbance At The Heron House\\", as well as \\"Oddfellows Local 151\\" and \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" are the best examples of sociopolitical songwriting the band ever had. This is perhaps due to the fact the band became so big (and thus less on the pulse of the everyday man) on subsequent releases. These four, and in particular the first two listed, are among my personal favorites of the band's career. <br />1987 was a huge year for alternative rock, perhaps the biggest between 1976 and 1991. Key releases by many artists (U2's The Joshua Tree, INXS's Kick, 10,000 Maniacs' In My Tribe, The Replacements' Pleased To Meet Me) really pushed the genre toward the end of that decade with more energy than gathered at one point prior. <br />Document was at the center of that push, and is a must-own for not just alt. rock fans, but really anyone who studies and enjoys the development of pop music in America.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|1976's \\"A Star Is Born\\" has a rich, burnished look and the romantic duo of Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson at the peak of their charismatic movie-star charms. The film--a third-time go around with a masochistic plot concerning a burnt-out male entertainer on his way out and his innocent songbird spouse just experiencing big-time fame--is pure soap, yet the handling stays fairly light and doesn't get too heavy-handed (at least until the final act). Streisand (who executive produced, and perhaps directed many sequences as well) has an extremely keen and aware sense of what her audience wants from her, and she's careful to ensure the movie is spirited with a lively pace and features some good humor. Her rapport with Kristofferson is also convincing, and the early part of their star-crossed romance is bracing, with lots of raucous show-biz business to keep things from getting too sudsy. Unfortunately the script (which Streisand concedes was added to freely and frequently) seems to lose its focus once the lovers get married, becoming mired in a necessary but glum downward spiral that isn't punctuated by much character. Barbra's Esther Hoffman goes on tour, films a TV show, argues with her husband's manager, wins a Grammy--and it's just a bushel of scenes the dialogue fails to bring together as a cohesive whole (this may be a reason why the climactic events aren't really gripping or moving the way a surefire tear-jerker would be). Much better than the film itself is Streisand's full-length commentary; Barbra gets curiously quiet during the full-blown melodrama in the movie's last half, admitting during a fight scene that \\"when it's heavy..you love it or hate it\\". She's candid and entertaining in her recollections about making the picture, the '70s clothes, and her off-screen relationship with Kristofferson, which extends to their humorous wardrobe tests and to the batch of deleted scenes. B+
B000IJ79WU|5.0|OMG!  I bought this DVD the day it came out, and was completely thrilled!  Yeah, the pacing is a bit off in some parts, there are a few *small* continuity holes, and certain scenes have a rough feel to them, but overall, this is THE definitive Superman II.  Before buying this, you have to consider that the movie will never be truly completed as Richard Donner envisioned it.  Donner was never allowed to finish shooting footage intergal to the plot.  That said, Donner has done an AMAZING job with what he had to work with.  Actually, it was his editor that did most of the work, but regardless, the end result is SPECTACULAR!      Donner trims some of the action, but the parts that he cut were the parts that NEEDED to be cut, such as the ridiculaous CELLOPHANE S that Superman throws in the Fortress of Solitude showdown.  The scenes that Donner put back in add SO much to the character development and story.      If you can overlook the MINIMAL problems inherent to this DVD, you'll very much enjoy it for what it is - a look at what the franschise could've been had not the Lester and the Salkinds hijacked a perfectly good picture!!
0393324818|3.0|I read the whole book on a plane while flying to Asia and thoroughly enjoyed it. I agreed with most of it's assessments on Bill James and his mathematical analytical approach to baseball's success; that arrogant Old Guard baseball men can't seem to understand enough to create good baseball teams; that having a 95+ fastball doesn't mean the pitcher will be great or that having a 6'5\\" body with great throwing arm and power translates into a great hitter.    However, there are some silly assessments in this book I have to point out.    1) One page said the Mets made a stupid move drafting Scott Kazmir, who was a high school draftee. Kazmir???????? The same Kazmir who has amazing stuff and probably will be one of the great lefthanders for years to come??!!!!    2) The Sox was looked upon as idiots in the late 90s for not utilizing Scott Hatteberg correctly. You got to be kidding me. Those same Sox teams lead the league in runs for many years (scored over 900 runs with Mo Vaughn and John Valentin.) I won't say those Sox teams were idiots; they just had a different philosophy on hitting that was equally good as the As.    3) Again on Sox (yes, you probably know I'm Sox fan now!!) They were looked upon as clueless when it came to trying to acquire Cliff Floyd. C'mon. It's a trade for someone who can spark a team to the World Series. And if I remembered correctly the prospects the Sox gave up were not that great.     4) Even though I love As' philosophy on building winning teams, it's not the only formula that is successful. As the Angels, Marlins and Red Sox showed, you can win World Series w/o getting players that have high OBP.     Again, I love this book. However, it doesn't take a genius to know that'it's very biased towards the A's.
B0002VK66U|5.0|I feel I should step in here and defend this cd. Sure, this cd is not Rainbow, Deep Purple, Yngwie ('Odyssey' is my fave JLT cd, along with 'Bent Out Of Shape') or some of JLT's later hard rock efforts, but it should be said that the label was trying to sell JLT as a crossover pop rock artist, and a fine AOR/pop rock album it is. Sure it has the 80's synth sounds and huge drums, because....drum roll.......it was recorded in 1985!  <br /> <br />Some of the songs remind me of Foreigner, which I happen to love! JLT sounds fantastic on this cd and the song 'Endlessly' is an amazing pop rock song!  <br /> <br />On another note, his last 2 releases 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Sunstorm' are both fantastic and, ironically, some of the songwriting is very reminiscent of Rescue You.  <br /> <br />Regardless of the material, JLT could make the worst album sound good. Those who are reading this are likely here because they are fans of his voice. <br /> <br />This is a fantastic AOR record and one that all JLT fans should check out.
B000001EG6|4.0|I consider \\"Elton John\\" to \\"Captain Fantastic\\" a single chapter of Elton John's body of work. Obviously it is the chapter of his body of work where he was at his peak.  <br /> <br />When you compare this album to his most recent works, it is really hard to believe it is the same person. However, even comparing it to the aforementioned \\"Captain Fantastic,\\" a span of roughly 6 years, the differences between the two albums are astounding. <br /> <br />The standouts here are, of course \\"Your Song,\\" the first Elton song the majority of the country heard, \\"Border Song,\\" and \\"Take Me To The Pilot.\\" There are other great songs here too that never got airplay. <br /> <br />The remastered version has solid bonus tracks, including an early version of \\"Grey Seal,\\" which would be \\"officially\\" released on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.

It is so tender and shows the true  and marvelous hart of a special boy who finds a new friend in a magical snowman, that plays with him, and flies him to the north pole to meet Santa Claus.  The Snowman is so beautiful and the song is so beatifully sung by the soprano boy Peter Auty.  I saw this picture on TV 25 years ago and just now is when I could buy it in DVD from Amazon.  I recommend this picture to all families with small children.  It is magnificent.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Foremost, Shainburg's film is based on a short-story from Mary Gaitskill's \\"Bad Behavior\\" collection. Shainberg first made a film-short from this work. Remaining true to the original, the film was dark and concluded with the mental destruction of \\"Debby\\" (later renamed \\"Lee\\"). Shainberg states that he wanted to create the this new adaptation years ago, but could not find backing for his quirky film. Following a wave of successful feminist-films (Shainberg credits Jane Campion in particular), the director was able to return to this piece. With the guidance of Maggie Gyllenhaal (only twenty-three at the time!), the script was rewritten to empower Lee. Every word was scrutinized ... the team even had Lizzie West re-record the song \\"Chariots Rise\\" because of a single line that might detract from the overall positive message. So have no reservations about this work ... after a rigorous rewrite, \\"Secretary\\" is a feminist-film about \\"choice.\\" (Remember, Lee chooses to remain at the desk ... in this moment, she is the \\"master\\" of Grey's future. She holds his heart in her hands). From Gaitskill's gloomy eight-pages to Shainberg's lush tale, one marvels at this director's talent for adaptation!<br /><br />While many viewers focus on Lee's transformation (logically so since she narrates), this film is as much about Mr. Grey's transformation as it is hers. The wonder of this work resides in beholding two \\"sick\\" people make each other healthy. Watch how posture straightens, how facial ticks disappear, how voices become bolder, and how both Lee and Grey become more radiant as the film progresses. Compare their initial encounter with the film's final scene to confirm that they nurture each other. (This is also underscored by Shainberg's repeated use of symmetry. Note how the film's framing often creates an almost split-screen effect ... harmony resides here).<br /><br />I feel it necessary to note that this film does not imply that Grey \\"cures\\" Lee's desire for self-mutilation. Psychologically speaking, Lee simply replaces the pain she experiences from cutting with the \\"pain\\" of spanking. In this, the film remains realistic and truthful to the disease. And, one is forced to wonder ... would a life with docile Peter push Lee back to her cutting-kit and polyester dresses? What can he offer her as a substitute for her pain?<br /><br />A technical note: if you are screening \\"Secretary\\" for the first time, (or are a fan already), you will want to watch the prevalence of the color purple. In film, \\"purple\\" can signify transformation ... but is also the color of childishness (think about how often you see purple adult-clothing ... now think about how often you see purple clothing on children) ... but, one must not forget that purple is also the color of bruises. How do these all tie together? Watch how purple moves from Lee's personal-life to her work-life ... seemingly indicating a transition from silly snowglobes to hidden bruises ... from a giggling woman suffering arrested-development to a poised woman choosing a very adult lifestyle. And watch for \\"purple's\\" childish resurgence in a hideous grape-shaped ring-box presented in the basement of J.C.Penny's (you will know when you see it!)<br /><br />Shainberg's film can seem slow to the uninitiated. Conservative (read: \\"timid\\") viewers or those unaccustomed to indie films may not enjoy it. For the rest, it is deliciously tormenting! It is playful, funny, and dark. For me, its charms are uplifting. Since it is designed as a fairy-tale for adults, \\"Secretary\\" plays on the notion that \\"there is someone for everyone.\\" In a way, it is a chick-flick with a twist (and Shainberg confirms that women tend to gravitate to this film more than men ... but men can certainly enjoy it!)<br /><br />This film is a rare gem for anyone interested in the \\"softer-side\\" of SMBD, in WAY off-beat romance, or even in feminist film.eaking, Lee simply replaces the pain she experiences from cutting with the \\"pain\\" of spanking.

Since it is designed as a fairy-tale for adults, \\"Secretary\\" plays on the notion that \\"there is someone for everyone.\\" In a way, it is a chick-flick with a twist (and Shainberg confirms that women tend to gravitate to this film more than men ... but men can certainly enjoy it!)    This film is a rare gem for anyone interested in the \\"softer-side\\" of SMBD, in WAY off-beat romance, or even in feminist film.
B000J103X4|2.0|Wow, does this guy suck without Dre! Actually, he just trys to rap like Dre (who is a sick producer but so-so rapper) and lacks much if any individuality in his flow. He keeps sweatin' Dre and Aftermath so much he sounds like a groupie. He has beats from Just Blaze, Will.I.Am, Kanye West, Scott Storch who all manage to create lame sounding Death Row style throwaway beats. Game definitely dug through the discount bins of the hot producers to get their names on his album. The song with Kanye bites an old Pac classic, which is decent and keeps this from only getting one star.
B000JSI7AI|3.0|Yes, for fans, this is beyond a let-down.  Where are the MANY deleted scenes, the Ang Lee commentary, the costume, production, location, etc etc sections?  Where's the rare Annie Proulx commentary that would really cap it?   <br /> <br />BUT <br /> <br />As a gift, it's great.  For family and friends who put up with my constant insistence that they see it, for people who need to have it, but didn't (and wouldn't) buy it for themselves, for those who WILL be impressed by this lineup of quasi-bonuses and would settle for the original DVD, it's a wonderful holiday gift.  And because they delayed the release, it'll be a nice post-holiday surprise too. <br /> <br />I'm the one who wants the TRUE collectors' edition, and I'll wait for Criterion to get hold of it and do it right.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Feels like I'm listening to Stevie Ray at times.  That is a compliment.  Mayer may not have the skills, or maybe he does, as other legendary blues musicians but the group on stage does a great job.  He is still a young guy and one day we will look back and appreciate his music even more.
B000J103X4|1.0|game is whack,you should go back to the gay unit. you suck,they suck,the whole rap industry sucks.in the 90's it was quality,but when you sell over 5 million units and you have no skills you know there's something wrong.like gay-z,gay unit,eminem,game there's just too many to name.pac would ride on all you fools.makaveli the don r.i.p.
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|i am a huge incubus fan, so i was really excited for the cd to be released. when i got the cd, i was kind of dissappointed. the lyrics seemed to be kind of mainstream pop/boy bandish. there were a few notable great songs like light grenades, which sounds like something from their SCIENCE cd. i also agree that it definitely would have been better had it been longer. i have loved every one of their cds, particularly the last four, but it seems to me that through most of this album, they lost their style that defined them.
B000JJRIO8|1.0|this is the worst pac record to date,i thought the last one was.i just wish you would leave his music alone,cause it doesnt look like its going to get better.i thought i would never say this but i hope theres never a pac record to get released again,lets face it rap  mucic is dead,once it went commercial.makaveli r.i.p.
0679411585|5.0|I saw the movie and im not even in any branch of the military. i've never thought war was romantic. this is probably the best war book to get. it shows what valor and bravery and death in the battlefield are really about. Hal Moore was a brilliant tactician. His men were loyal. And they were all brave. Read this and find out what war is really like and learn respect for the men who serve in our Armed Forces. <br /> <br />If you serve in the Armed Forces i want to thank you no matter what your job is. I have family in the Air Force and friends in the Army. I respect every soldier we have in the Forces. So thank you for serving our country well.
0953104907|4.0|I just completed my first electric using this book. I am conservative with ratings and would like to give it a 4.5 out of five. <br /> <br />My guitar was of my own design, and a bit more complecated than the ones used as examples, but used the principles in the book. The lack of a true 5-star rating was because I felt the subject matter jumped around a little, and there were a couple of 'Huh???' moments reading the examples and instructions. For example, calculating the neck angle using the example took me several read-throughs before I 'got it', when the addition of a simple extra sentence could have made the example very clear. Another was a somewhat sparse explanation of finishing techniques. Still, using the book examples will take you there. You will need to do minor British-to-American-English translation on occasion, but that adds charm to the book. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this is one of those I-would-buy-again books if I lost it! <br /> <br />The guitar came out great, by the way! I agree that you will NOT save money building your own axe, but the satisfaction derived is worth a lot more than money. As a side effect of gaining the skills explained in the book, I am now free (mentally) to sell off a few of my 'store bought' guitars, such as my Strat and Les Paul, because I know I can make my own close-copy or replacement.  <br /> <br />There is worth in doing it yourself and this book takes you on that journey.
B0000696I1|3.0|I bought this movie along with a 10inch size turtle it came together as a package i hope my 2 yr old son likes , i like it too bad im not a kid anymore lol . . .
1400079594|5.0|This book is a good introduction to the Jeeves and Wooster series.  The story is stupefyingly complex, the dialogue hilarious, and the characters unforgettable.  Really get involved in reading Wodehouse's body of work and you will find \\"Woosterisms\\" creeping into your vocabulary: you will be referring to chums as \\"old bean\\" and greeting people with a merry \\"What ho!\\"
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Don't believe the naysayers.  95% of people like myself who saw the first Superman II, loved it, but had problems with some of the stupid humor, will love this version.  Obviously, you can't go back and fix everything.  For those who complain about the screen test footage, it's been over 25 years people!!!  I for one am absolutely stunned by what was saved and the quality of it.  And where there is an opportunity to have an alternate take of the same scene, it's in here.  I had heard over 50% of the film would be new.  Well, with the alternative takes, it seems like more like 80% of the film is new!  And I have gone back and looked at Lester's Superman II again, and there is no comparison.  Practically every single dumb humor moment that was in Lester's Superman II has been cut and has been replaced with Brando footage as the film was originally intended.  It's like cutting out the Jerry Lewis humor and replacing it with Lawrence Olivier.  If you liked the opening ten minute credit sequence of Lester's Superman III, then I guess you might like Lester's version better.  But I think for 95% of Superman fans it's not even a debatable subject. <br /> <br />POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: <br />I will not mention what new Richard Donner footage there is, (you should enjoy that for the first time yourself) but for those of you who want to know exactly what \\"dumb humor\\" or illogical stuff that has been cut from Lester's version that IS NOT in Richard Donner's version, read on below... <br /> <br />Lois' chain-smoking orange juice squeezing scene. - Gone! <br />Zod raising farmer with silver beam from his finger. - Gone! <br />Ursa beating farmer at arm wrestling. - Gone! <br />Almost all jokes relating to Non's dumbness including his inability to use heat vision like the others. - Gone! <br />Lame wise-cracking bell hop at Niagara Falls \\"have a happy.... whatever\\" - Gone! <br />Superman steps into molecule chamber with Superman suit on, and exits wearing street clothes? - Gone!  (Now he enters and exits with street clothes.  Some scenes appear to have been reshot with a body double for Reeve.) <br />During super fight, long extended scene with earthquake going on while Superman and Non fight underground and humans on surface bounce around like bowling pins had been drastically reduced. <br />During super fight, all jokes relating to villains blowing at humans are gone, (ice cream cone in face, toupee falling off, laughing man falling over in phone booth and continues to talk - all gone.  The rollerskating backward guy is seen only briefly if you look for him, but he's not at all obvious like before. <br />Ursa hits Non accidentally with flag pole and kid on street says, \\"Wow, home run.....\\" - Gone! <br />Three villains each using their silver beams against Superman at the Fortress of Solitude. - Gone! <br />Superman throwing a red \\"S\\" at Non at the Fortress of Solitude.. - Gone! <br />Superman playing stupid Krypton \\"hide and seek\\" superpower game at Fortress of Solitude with villains. - Gone! <br /> <br />There are a few jokes that were cut that could have remained, but after looking at Lester's Superman's II again back-to-back with this new version, like I said, there's no comparison.  Buy it now. <br />
074356619X|5.0|I have watched The Secret numerous times and wanted something to listen to at work and in the car. I considered buying the soundtrack from the film but then took a look at the book in a bookstore and realized that much of the information in the movie is actually expounded upon, so I opted for the book on CD. Well, it's perfect. You get Rhonda Byrne's sweet and loving voice taking you through all the points of the secret like a caring and compassionate friend, adding more detail as she goes. And of course all the teachers voices are there too. I'm so pleased with this unabridged CD, I think it's better than the movie because of all the additional content and  I can take it with me wherever I go! <br />Thanks for all the hardwork that must have gone in to doing this - I can't recommend it enough.
1400044162|3.0|This is a beautiful book whose characters are compelling but the pace of the plot was so slow, that I became dragged down and had a difficult time finishing it. Nevertheless, I learned a lot about Nigeria and Biafra-and am glad I read it-but wished I hadn't bought the hardcover.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|\\"Love\\" is not just another Beatles album, it is an unforgettable listening experience.  This is as close as we will ever get to a new Beatles recording.  I wish I had a way to contact Sir George Martin and Giles Martin.  I would like to personally thank them for what they have done.  Every time I listen to this \\"Love\\" I feel like I am 16 years old again.   <br /> <br />To all the purists who are screaming foul:  Paul and Ringo love this CD, so why should anyone else complain?  If you don't like it, don't listen to it.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|this is just what iron maiden needed.  and this cd is just what you need if you came to my review looking for an excuse to buy.  forget all the \\"progressive\\"-this and \\"evolutionary\\"-that horsecrap.  this album rocks hard and you will love it after 2-3 listens.  i cannot get over how crisp and clear all the varied instruments (including  voice) are.  this is a very technically proficient album, and yet...it is also heavy, epic and catchy.  basically...if you like iron maiden after all these years....long since we all thrust our metal-studded wrist-bands in the air...and now have kids of your own...this is a return to form for the band and for you and should not be missed.  this is the one album in the last few years that makes you glad you have grown up the way you have....eventhough you loved the maiden when you were young....really.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Got it today! The box is perfect and everything is great. Watched Special DVD and found at least 5 secret videos by just searching with my cursor in menues of DVD. It's awesome!!!!! I rate it as \\"MUST-HAVE\\" DVD.
074356619X|5.0|Absolutely the best book and video I have ever read...And I have read it all. Thank you to Rhonda and all the others who shared life's secret with us all.   <br />Many blessings and much GRATITUDE..
B000J10ERO|5.0|I saw this twice in the theaters, I just got the DVD on Tuesday.  The movie far exceeded my expectations.  Brandon Routh nailed both Superman AND Clark Kent!  It was so awesome.  All the action scenes were unbelievable (I bought the books that tell how the movie was made, and it took so much time and effort, time well-spent)!!!  I also was surprised by Kate Bosworth, she did a great job as Lois!!!  Kevin Spacey (believe it or not, it was my first movie I've seen of his) is one heck of an actor!!!  He got Lex's rotten attitude down pat, even made him seem even meaner, if that's at all possible.  I think every Superman fan should see this movie!  It was so well made, every aspect just worked out beautifully!  Well done everyone!!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I really like this album. Granted it is somewhat differant from the last one but its in a good way. Loved the last ones but this is awesome. <br />I really think everyone should buy it!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is absolutely gorgeous, true Sarah music. It is so beautiful it makes me want to cry.  If you are a Sarah fan, you will not be disappointed in this CD! Just lovely.  I think John Diliberto needs to review something other than music.
B000GRUMPU|2.0|Here's something I never, ever say about a movie: \\"Poseidon\\" is too short. The opening shot, a fake-o special effect circle around the ship, lasts nearly 3 minutes. I don't think any sequence that follows it lasts as long.  <br />All major characters and storylines are sketched into place and the ship flipped within the first 15 minutes (and that's taking at least 100 seconds to have the Black-Eyed Peas chick sing a song). Scenes whip along so quickly and with such a sense of rush that you do, indeed, feel like you're running cuz the ship is rapidly sinking... which would be good, if you'd ever had time to care about any of the characters. <br />The acting is passable, and Josh Lucas is actually pretty good in the lead. All the stuff blowing up and the water rushing about looks good enough. None of that's the problem. <br />The problem IS, you just don't care. You don't know anything at all about any of the characters (okay, I'm exaggerating: there's a young couple that you know are in love. There.) And there's no sense of a Big Plan being executed, so you could get involved in whether it's gonna work out. Yes, somebody spits out \\"Let's head for the propeller tubes!\\" and off they go...  <br />Rush rush rush. It's not just that there's no extra time devoted to developing the characters: scenes that SHOULD be there aren't. Example (SPOILER WARNING) we learn in about twenty words of dialogue that Richard Dreyfuss' character is gay and has been dumped. Fine. We see him about to kill himself over this by jumping overboard. Fine. He sees the \\"rogue wave\\" approaching and retreats. Okay. He's the only character who lives through the first 15 minutes who actually SAW what happened to them: he never mentions it. A few minutes later, he is required, basically, to deliberately kill another character to save himself. It's rather twisted, but there is an irony there that deserves at least a pause for his suicidal character to take a moment to examine. Nada. Nope, no time for reflection, we gotta hit the next explosion shot, RUN! <br />Since it ended so quickly, I took the time to watch the \\"Making Of\\" special feature, and from the interviews, you could tell that Wolfgang Petersen thought he was doing a good job, Lucas was very excited about what they were doing, many crew members believed they were working on a film that would be cutting-edge and state-of-the-art. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, and have decided to assume that some idiotic producer demanded they trim the film down to an hour-and-a-half, to maximize the number of showings per day, and so, in the process, they edited this thing down to a skeleton, slicing out all the \\"fat\\" that might have made it compelling. <br />It's a true shame. Hokey though the 1972 original was, it was involving and a whole lot of fun. A solid remake using today's special effects and approach to narrative was a great idea. Who knows? Maybe now that this outline was booed off the screen, Petersen will be given the chance to go back to the editing room and re-cut us a 2 1/2 hour version that WILL be worth watching. I hope so.
0307341542|1.0|I think the author looks at too much TV.(and we know television rots the mind)...it reads like a Lifetime made for TV melodrama; there was nothing sympathetic, engaging, heartwarming about any of the characters.....my feeling is so what if someone has had to endure a horrid childhood...one understands but still finds them disgusting...that's my feeling about the entire book....drab, grey pathetic characters...There's no contrast, no verve..no burst of life...just endless grey mediocrity....And disease of the week..stuff...<br /><br />Methinks maybe she's should work for a drug company...Flynn will doubtless increase sales.fivefold..after you read this clinker you may just reach for the anti-depressant....or two or three...
B000I0QK74|5.0|It doesn't get any better than that.   <br /> <br />Yes, there are some really fine songs here, with new versions of old favorites.  But, the absolute best song in this collection has got to be the duet with Natalie Cole, \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\".  I don't know of any other Christmas song that is sexy.  This one song is worth the price of the whole CD.  It makes me want to sit down with a glass of wine in front of the fireplace and watch the lights on the tree and dream a little, even when I don't have time for that. But, it's always worth it. <br /> <br />This is my second favorite CD ever (first is Nat King Cole and his rendition of \\"O Holy Night\\", which is not at all sexy, but does make me cry it's so beautiful). Third, in case you're looking for more good xmas music, is Celtic Woman's \\"A Christmas Celebration\\", which is obviously a totally different sound but still so good you stand still and hold your breath. <br /> <br />I asked for this for Christmas, even though I already have a copy.  That's a first.  But, I don't want to take any chances on not having a good copy of this beautiful music.   <br /> <br />Obviously, highly recommended.
B000I2JKE2|4.0|I was so looking forward to see The Richard Donner cut of Superman II and I was thriled when I learnt Amazon shipped my copy of The HD DVD version.As soon as I received I popped it into the player.How did I like the new version? Well I think it's a mix bag,I did enjoy some of the new scenes such as with Lex Luthor,but theres some scenes I did not like,such as the new scene where Lois finaly figures out Clark is Superman.I thought the scene in the Lester version was mutch better and when Lois find out his secret in the Lester version she pures her heart out to Superman and declaring her love for him,that is gone in The Donner cut.And yes I too like alot of other people did not like the new ending,I think they should of used Lesters ending.Other then these small complaints I enjoyed watching the new version of Superman 2 and in High Def.Warner did a great job with this release.I do hope Warner will also release The Lester version of 2 on HD DVD also? And yeah I know alot of people hated 3 and 4 but I would like to have them as well in HD.Great stuff!
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|This is definitely not Incubus' strongest album, but it does have a good mix of fast and slow songs. Particulary notable songs include: Dig, Oil & Water, Rogues, Light Grenades, and Pendulous Threads. None of the 13 tracks can really be considered 'terrible' though. I would have to say Earth to Bella would have been better if it was one song and not split up into two parts. If I had to pick, Earth to Bella parts 1 and 2 are the weakest cuts on the album. Overall though, this is a good pick up for fans of Incubus. Good all-around CD.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|Okay, there is no way I am going to rehash what you have already read, and this review will likely disappear soon in the morass of reviews to come (there are already 127 of them inside a week of it's release), but to be sure, you have been reading reviews that touch on the history of this project, on the contents of the CD/DVD, and on the controversy we all knew it would spark the moment we learned of it.<br /><br />But let's talk about how this music makes us FEEL!  Further down you will or have read a review by a \\"professional musician\\" (and others) who take a machette to the whole concept that this album is.  I for one am a Beatles \\"purist\\".  I am also an engineer.  I know technology, I know electronics, I know systems and processes and the cutting edges of our technological growth.  But...I fixed the hole in head where the rain got in a long time ago.  Do these (so called) purists, and experts, and critics have NO imagination?  What were The Beatles all about there folks?  If you are a Beatle fan, old or new, young or aged, jaded, faded, or just born, surely you have been fixing that hole and allowing for the love and introspection and imagination that was the driving creativity of The Beatles and Sir Martin.<br /><br />Just listen to this, have fun, it is an immense undertaking and don't let the detractors sway your impulses that this is simply what the boys were all about.  \\"Love\\" is a masterpiece.  If you listen to this and just enjoy it for it's creativity and ingenuity, as well as it's perfectly polished sound, and realize that this is created from masters that are 35 to 40 years old, pieces of products that were taken from a vault, the dust blown off, and set into motion on digital engineering equipment; if you have IMAGINE-ation, and Love The Beatles for what they were, a driving force in revolutionary music, and \\"a little band that just wanted to sing about love\\", if you can just enjoy something without over-analysis, then you will truly consider this a masterpiece.<br /><br />This is NOT a cash cow pulled out just in time for Christmas shopping, this is NOT a whim designed to part you from your money (just look at the Amazon and Walmart prices of the CD), nor is it a contrivance like so many \\"best of\\" compilations.  It was a labor of love on the part of Sir George Martin, his son Giles (George declares this is his last project and he is turning the reins over to Giles), and fully blessed by Olivia Harrison (George wanted to make this and started planning it with Cirque Du Soleil before he died), Yoko Ono, Ringo Starr, and Paul McCartney, none of whom have any need for more pocket change.<br /><br />This is music that feels good!  I wish more artists had left the legacy and the creativity that The Beatles did, but they were one of a kind and this \\"soundscape\\" album is a one of a kind.  So fill the cracks that run through the door, that keep your mind from wandering where it will go because it really doesn't matter, if you're wrong, you're right!s a masterpiece. <br /> <br />This is NOT a cash cow pulled out just in time for Christmas shopping, this is NOT a whim designed to part you from your money (just look at the Amazon and Walmart prices of the CD), nor is it a contrivance like so many \\"best of\\" compilations.

B00000JPYD|5.0|Trower's departure from Procol Harum allowed him to pursue his Hendrix fixation and hone his guitar attack with precision and skill.  He finally hit paydirt in 1974 with Bridge of Sighs, a monumental record from a monumental talent.  This re-release sound as fresh and vital as if Trower recorded it yesterday.<br /><br />Using a stripped-down three piece ensemble, Trower manages to pack more intense, driving music between the grooves than seems possible -- his mastery of his instrument, his effortless leads, slides, effects, and unique sounds -- enables him to create an virtuosic otherworldly space inside his mind that is fully realized, moody, energetic, beautiful, and thrilling.<br /><br />For me the title track remains one of Trower's finest pieces of recorded music -- intense, brooding, weary, relentless, and ultimately redemptive.  Is there anyone who can hear the opening bars of that song, with its amazing and creative wash of sounds, the dragging bass line, the fat guitar, and not feel better?<br /><br />The bonus tracks find Trower's three-piece rocking out in LA in 1974 -- not essential, but coming after the studio versions, an interesting look at how these songs sound live.  Hint:  pretty darn good.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Less is more? Uh? Who said that???? <br /> <br />Enter Muse, the biggest small band to come this way of Mars since..... well, maybe since the Pumpkins disbanded..... <br /> <br />If you are not familiar with the band's previous offerings, you may well be dazzled by the sheer display of arpegios, crescendos, falsettos, and operistic melodrama.... <br />Muse consists of a trio, it's true, but the musicians stretch themselves as far as it is possible to create a very, very BIG sound. <br /> <br />The result is very pretentious, but delivers most of the time.  <br /> <br />In this record, they are not ashamed of wearing their inlfuences.... And they resemble a lot to Queen, Rush, Depeche Mode, Prince?, and even Ennio Morricone....  <br />This album was made having a rock stadium in mind, and each song works better live than on the record (I know cause I've seen them play, and boy oh boy), but there are many good songs here anyway (though maybe not as good as in their previous two recordings). <br /> <br />Anyway, give this album a chance.... And if you don't end up shaking your hair to the twisted solo of the last song, then check out Origin of Symmetry, or Absolution, which are, for me, five star records. <br /> <br /> <br />Oh, some songs i'd recommend: all of them!, save maybe Exo Politics and Assasin (they've already made this song but a lot better with Stockholm Syndrome). <br /> <br />Oh, and don't forget to check them live. They were really made for it!!!
B000063DS1|5.0|The Band puts on a historic show that is amazingly captured and packaged in a beautiful collectors case. You need to hear this if you dig classic rock.
B00000099Y|5.0|The album that opened up my third eye.  Everything on this album is memorable, and anybody that is a fan of prog metal or even heavy metal owes it to themselves to pick it up.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Alright first of all, ive been listening to Incubus for quite some time now, and they have grown on me.  At first, SCIENCE was a little bit too hard for me, then it grew on me. Make Yourself as well as Morning View were excellent and A Crow... seemed to be somewhat of a mixture of their albums... which turned out pretty good in my opinion (aside from what other fans seem to think).  Light Grenades isn't a very bad album.. you MUST listen to it a few times before you make your decision to deem it \\"garbage\\".  The first listen I was actually disapointed, however, after about three more times listening through the entire CD I realized it was great.  Sure, its no Make Yourself or even Morning View, however, it does have it's good points. <br /> <br />1. Quicksand ( 8 / 10 ) - As far as I can remember, most (if not all) of incubus' previous albums have started off with a hard rock song.  On LG, they decide to start with a slow song that seems somewhat distant at first, which really belongs in its spot as an intro.  If you really listen to the lyrics you will realize this is a beautiful song... and a perfect intro.  It leads into A Kiss perfectly. <br /> <br />2. A Kiss To Send Us Off ( 9 / 10 ) - This is one of the high points on the album. It somewhat reminds me of \\"Nice To Know You\\" off of Morning View.  Both songs have hard rock and then they are slowed down (especially the last verse of A Kiss). The lyrics are good, and the guitar work displayed by Mike is exceptional.  Just give this song a chance, you may not like it at first, but it will definitely grow on you. <br /> <br />3. Dig ( 9 / 10 ) - Dig is an excellent song that could possibly see some time on the radio.  Listen to the lyrics, they are great. Possibly my favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />4. Anna Molly ( 9 / 10 ) - The first single off the cd, Anna Molly, is the only song (other than Dig) that will probably be on the radio.  Good lyrics, great guitar. <br /> <br />5. Love Hurts ( 6 / 10 ) - The first time I heard this song I loved it.  That was until I paid attention to the lyrics. Sure, the guitars good, but the lyrics aren't really up to par, an example is, \\"Love hurts but sometimes its a good hurt\\". I know what you mean by this, Brandon, but I don't really think this should have been part of the chorus, it makes the song sound somewhat corny. <br /> <br />6. Light Grenades ( 9 / 10 ) - Any fan of S.C.I.E.N.C.E should enjoy this song.  Very fast paced song. <br /> <br />7. Earth To Bella Part I ( 7 / 10 ) - Aside from what others think, I don't really have a problem with this song.  It starts off pretty good then the guitar just being smacked is pretty unpredictable.. but its not that bad after a few listens. <br /> <br />8. Oil and Water ( 8 / 10 ) - Another good song on the album.. didn't like it that much at first but it grew on me. Love the lyrics. <br /> <br />9. Diamonds and Coal ( 5 / 10 ) - In my opinion, one of, if not, the worst song on the album. Reminds me of some elevator-type beat. <br /> <br />10. Rogues ( 8 / 10 ) - Another quick song on the album, great drum work by Jose. Love Brandon's voice in this. <br /> <br />11. Paper Shoes ( 6 / 10 ) - This song isn't bad.. it just annoys me.  I really don't know why.. its just.. bleh. <br /> <br />12. Pendulous Threads ( 7 / 10 ) - Didn't listen to this song all that much.. it isn't THAT bad.. perhaps it will grow on me. <br /> <br />13. Earth to Bella II ( 5 / 10 ) - Good for an outro i guess.. but it really makes the other Earth to Bella look bad. <br /> <br />Overall, its a pretty good album. The lyrics are pretty deep.  The earth to bella's im sure have some more meaning than i could pull out of them. One thing I didn't like very much was the lack of DJ Kilmore.  He seemed like he wasn't even in, or didnt play a very big role, in any of the songs. Like I said before, its no Make Yourself or Morning View, but a good album.
0393327345|5.0|I like to read things that come from Chuck Palahniuk's mind. The result could be good (Diary) or bad (Invisible Monsters); sometimes you never know. What you do know is that the story will likely be something you could never come up with on your own. That is not to say that they are mystery novels and the suspense is imaginative. Though Palahniuk's suspense is certainly imaginative, his stories follow no mold I have seen before.  <br /> <br />Chuck Palahniuk is probably just what you would expect him to be like, should you have an opportunity to see him. I saw him give a speech a few years ago, and he was just as I expected. He said that when he writes books he tends to pick one music album to listen to while he writes. One album. For Fight Club, he said he listened to The Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails. Again, probably just as you would have expected. Neat guy. Wonderful speaker. Incredibly interesting writer.  <br /> <br />I have seen the movie adaptation for Fight Club. I love the movie and am always impressed with the parts played by Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, Jr. I was not hesitant, but rather curious to read the book. Normally I figure a person will prefer whichever version they experience first. I wasn't reading the book in hopes that it would be better than the movie since as they say, \\"the book is always better.\\" I wanted to see this story on paper through Palahniuk's eyes and with his words rather than a Hollywood adaptation of both.  <br /> <br />I found exactly what I had hoped for. The foundation was the same as the movie, but the writing was a little rougher around the edges. It was rough because it was not written to appeal to a broader audience like the movie script was, and it was rough because it was his first book. Like many authors, Palahniuk's writing has become...smoother, for lack of a better term, with each book he has written. Please do not interpret that as a complaint with the book or a negative comment, it is only an observation. If anything, it made the book better as it was more fitting with the feel of the story.  <br /> <br />I have seen the movie. Any potential, big plot-twist at the end of the story, if one existed....would not have been a surprise reading the book. I did not care. I wasn't reading the book for the story to be new again. I was only interested in seeing the story a different way, which I was able to do. Fight Club isn't the best book I have ever read, nor is it one of my favorites, but I am glad I took the time to read it. And I recommend it. You have no excuses, it's short.  <br />
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I was very pleased with this version of the film.  If the original release didn't exist I don't think anyone would have critiqued it as bad as they did.  I love the scenes with Reeve and Brando and the end was actually pretty good.  You just have to step out of what Lester's ending was.  Sure he had his vengence on the trucker after the turning of time but the trucker didn't show any recognition of Clark.  The only bit that could've been changed was the old man behind the counter stating that he just had the place fixed.  Another question I would have would be Zod + company coming back from the phantom zone which seems like they would.   <br />I really liked it though and am happy to have it in my collection.
B000IBHMWK|3.0|I was not able to watch the movie with the Viewer on my PC but it did work on my laptop.  It only took two days to get everything worked out. I was also able to view Part 1 and some of Part 2 of the Menagerie with the latest version of Winamp on my PC.  I still love the original Star Trek shows.  Yes, they do look hokey by today's special effect standards; but hey I grew up watching them.  Because of the hassle with the Viewer I could only give a 3 rating.
0345475674|4.0|'Pompeii' is a highly readable historical mystery set in Roman Pompeii in 79 C.E. just before the 'you know what' happens. Robert Harris has an eye for historical detail and can spin a good yarn. The reader of Pompeii learns a bit about Roman aqueducts, the Roman empire and, of course, volcanoes.<br /><br />The protagonist, Marcus Attilius Primus, is the new 'aquarius' sent out from Rome to take over the care and maintenance of the Aqua Augusta, the immense aqueduct that served the Bay of Naples area. Figure out just what did happen to the former aquarius, why the water has dried up, and how did a former slave become the (apparently) richest, most powerful man in Pompeii. Meet Pliny the Elder along the way.<br /><br />A fun read. Highly recommended for lovers of water, volcanoes, and the Roman Empire.
0802130208|5.0|What can I say about this book that will accurately surmise the story and its habitual moments of hilarity?  Well, it's not that easy.  The book is not exactly based on a clearly defined story line but rather on the interactions and failed enterprises of some very colorful characters in New Orleans.  The story of these individuals (individuals one might refer to as dolts, hence the use of the word \\"dunces\\" in the title), is spearheaded by one Ignatius J. Reilly.  At thirty-three Ignatius is stuck in prepubescence, can't keep a job to save his life, and suffers from an impassioned antipathy for modernity.  He is taunted through correspondence by an associate named Myrna Minkoff, who is 'socially loose' and condemns Ignatius - with unparallel buffoonery - for not doing anything with his life.  The rest of the characters Toole presents us with are equally farcical and suffer from that nincompoop condition that plague Ignatius and Myrna.<br /><br />But Ignatius and Myrna are only two of the characters you will encounter in this great book.  To meet the rest of the confederacy you must read the story.

B00005B36H|5.0|This is hands-down THE masterpiece of 2001, and, in my opinion, the best album of the early 21st century. It's not just music, the entire album and the artwork it comes with is truly an experience - the perfect realization of a dedicated and persistent vision.<br /><br />The music is exquisite. Every song is not just a journey in-and-of-itself, but they all culminate into a perfectly paced, wondrously executed singular pulse that is Lateralus. The album cover is translucent and flips open to reveal the different layers of the human body, including a spiritual layer representing vrajna, the transcendental wisdom of enlightenment or union with the divine. Partially obscured in the brain matter on the final layer is the word \\"God.\\" The artwork was done by artist Alex Grey.<br /><br />The lyrics and musical progressions of the songs on the album also encompass this theme of deep enlightenment, but, thanks to Maynard's genius, can also be interpreted very subjectively. \\"The Grudge\\" is thematically about, well, a grudge, or misguided attempts at holding one, with the significance of Saturn being that which rules over a negative person (the Saturnist). The lyrics give the advice to `let go' of a `fated anchor' before Saturn \\"consumes you.\\" Hence, let go of the grudge before it drags you down. \\"Eon Blue Apocalypse\\" acts as a placid introduction to \\"The Patient,\\" a song about waiting and `giving blood' for the `damaged and broken' but reaping rewards (i.e., self-healing) in the process. As is the case with many Tool songs, the meaning of \\"Schism,\\" the album's 5th track which is preceded by appropriately titled \\"Mantra,\\" is heavily debated by the fans. The most widely accepted translation is that the song deals with the differences between man and woman and their relationship. This is believed to be backed by the song's video, which features two humanoid creatures, which appear to be a male and a female.  \\"Parabol\\" and \\"Parabola,\\" the album's 6th and 7th tracks, act together as the central movement in Lateralus. While there is also a large debate in the Tool community about this song's ultimate meaning, it can all be boiled down thematically to the purity of an enlightening experience - whether it is birth, sex, love or possibly even the gift of life itself. \\"Ticks and Leeches,\\" the album's angriest track, is essentially about those who seek only to live off of others. Admittedly, this song seems a pariah when one tries to fit it into the album's theme. It seems to feed into anger, much the subjects of the song feed off others. Perhaps it another glimpse into the role of anger in the process of ultimate enlightenment, or perhaps it is just an angry side-step for the band. \\"Lateralus\\" is where the album's theme finally culminates and is fully explored. This song if crafted with an unprecedented attention the detail and is regarded by many as the band's deepest, most transcending song. Maynard James Keenan's vocals during the first few minutes of Lateralus form a Fibonacci sequence. The number of syllables progress to the sixth step, then back down to the first step; up to the seventh step, and then back to the fourth step. The Fibonacci sequence shares a relationship with Phi, the golden ratio. The golden ratio is used to describe spirals, which are mentioned several times in the lyrics. It all leads to the final, climactic verse: `With my feet upon the ground, I lose myself between the sounds and open wide to suck it in. I feel it move across my skin. I'm reaching up and reaching out. I'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me, whatever will bewilder me. And following our will and wind, we may just go where no one's been. We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been. Spiral out. Keep going, going...' may be interpreted as reaching a higher state of consciousness, or otherwise bettering oneself in a profound way. \\"Disposition\\" is a terse, but beautiful song about acceptance and forgiveness, which fades into the album's final thematic anthem: \\"Reflection.\\" This song reiterates Tool's consistant message throughout this other albums: our need to evolve and realize our full potential as beings of conscious thought. `Crucify ego before it's far too late to leave behind this place, so negative and blind and cynical.' After this 11 minute epic finally releases, we are lead into a pulsing instrumental, \\"Triad,\\" whose names refers to the mystical number \\"3\\" in many of the world religions, and emphasizes the album's thematic connection to vrajna. The album's final track,  \\"Faaip de Oiad\\" is a recording of a call from a 1997 conversation on Art Bell's radio program Coast to Coast AM. The caller, in a frantic tone, claimed to have been previously employed at Area 51 and stated that the true nature of aliens were that of \\"extra-dimensional beings\\" that have infiltrated the military establishment and plan to destroy the world's large population centers to more easily control the remaining humans. The broadcast was cut short however, when their transmitter failed but Art Bell returned on the air with the use of a back up link system. Supposedly, the same caller called back some weeks later and claimed it was a hoax. \\"Faaip de Oiad\\" is Enochian for \\"the voice of God.\\"<br /><br />It is easy to see why this album is held in such high regard. It is not just an auditory experience, it is truly something enlightening in its own regard - a homage to the true potential of music (yes, even `rock' music), and an exploration into ultimate human consciousness and enlightenment. No matter what type of music you like, this album is a MUST for anyone who appreciates true artistic and creative vision, and, not mention, incredibly arranged and composed music.h fades into the album's final thematic anthem: \\"Reflection.\\" This song reiterates Tool's consistant message throughout this other albums: our need to evolve and realize our full potential as beings of conscious thought. `Crucify ego before it's far too late to leave behind this place, so negative and blind and cynical.'

B0009A1AS2|2.0|Long time DT fan here, seen many of their shows.  The record contract must have some tight requirements on how often they have to squeeze out albums.  This cycle of heavy touring + quick album every two years is resulting in lots of weak efforts.  Every album after Scenes From a Memory has consisted of perhaps 50% throwaway tracks.  Octavarium is 75% throwaway.  DT should take a vacation, and then sit down and really write an album.  They're such talented musicians that even their rushed garbage is amazing, but it's not very good music.  Octavarium is mostly cheese and DT formula.  I hope we don't see another DT album until 2008 or 2009.  Maybe that will give them enough time to develop enough good ideas to fill a whole album.  On a related note, if you get \\"Score\\" the live album, Labrie's voice has never sounded better.  Enjoy.
0486650677|5.0|Lanczos makes mechanics feels like art in this superb work. Analytical Mechanics is the foundation of physics and Lanczos has complete command of the theme. The purpose of this book is to make one understand mechanics \\"from inside\\" and not to stress methods of problem solving. Lanczos says that very clearly in the preface. The beauty of the book is that it's not in the same category as Goldstein, instead feelink more likely to Landau, so the bad criticism of the 2-star guy comes from someone that missed this.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I have, like most people raised in the 60's, every Beatle album made.  In every case, I listen to the new release and think, 'yuup, it's them again'.  These are usually the same mixes, sometimes 'remastered' but generally the same. <br /> <br />Until this one.  It is like George Martin somehow got the four back into a modern 2006 studio and made them do it all over again.  I have NEVER heard Ringo on the drums sound like this.  The vocals are tight and fresh, the mixing is supurb. <br /> <br />I am truly blown away by this one.  Same songs but they all feel new.  Even \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand' live sounds like it was done last week. <br /> <br />If this were an album (you young people, check Wikipedia if you don't know what this is) I would play the grooves off it and need another.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|The tracks on this CD are so complicated and so intelligible that it requires a supercomputer just to analyze it. The Open Door simply does not make any sense. A CD is supposed to contain music. This CD is has no music on it. Maybe if we sent a radio signal of this CD to outer space we'd get a response from E.T. In the meantime, if you want to buy a music CD from Evanescence, get the Fallen CD.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I am glad that someone mentioned about her loss of her fiance.  I think the tone of the cd is timely.  It was made after a time of personal loss, and in a time of war.  The theme of love is spread throughout the album, and I for one find it very soothing.  Though it may not break any new ground in terms of sound, the cd is produced by Loreena (is this her first producer credit?), and is obviously a very personal work indeed.  For this reason, I respect her highly for it.  I also would agree that she didn't have to record anything at all. The fact that she did gave me an early Christmas present to myself.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Most Americans have heard of \\"that Al Gore documentary.\\" Well here it is, AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH.<br /><br />If you've followed U.S. politics at all over the past 20 years, you know that Al Gore is the environmental poster-boy thanks to his take on global warming and other green issues. It wouldn't be difficult to surmise that his presidential run may have been hamstrung by this very topic. Big Business doesn't usually sit in the environmentally friendly arena, and Big Business most certainly contributes (via backdoors) to candidates financial checking accounts.<br /><br />For better or worse, Al Gore lost his presidential bid. The \\"better\\" aspect is that Al was then free to do whatever he liked with his life. He wouldn't be in the spotlight or battling legislators. So what did he do? He went back to his roots.<br /><br />An Inconvenient Truth, a lecture/slide-show Gore has probably given hundreds of times, would otherwise be pushed aside by politicians as an attack on industry if it were done by anyone else. But Gore's been on the inside. His science is strong and his data backed by nearly every scientist on the planet (note the word \\"nearly\\", as some simply do not agree, but the overwhelming majority - 90% or higher - do). This is an important fact, as scientists follow data, not personal beliefs or the S&P 500.<br /><br />The entire documentary is about global warming and how amazingly ignorant or apathetic the world has become because of our reliance on outdated technology, our increasing population, and our refusal to change. The outdated technology is mostly about automobiles, since they produce the most greenhouse gas emissions. The fact that the world's population has gotten out of control can be seen simply by looking at various countries' census reports and then comparing them to agricultural and water needs. Our refusal to change is focused on throughout the film thanks to our reliance on oil, coal, and other non-replenishables.<br /><br />Al Gore has to be commended for doing such a great job on this documentary. He is the center of it, but he so effortlessly takes the focus off of himself and puts it on these hot-button topics that it's easy to forget we're learning material from a former vice-president. That was truly astonishing.<br /><br />Gore's passion for the global warming issues are admirable and most will probably be thankful that he's out there pushing this topic, trying to bend the ear of every person he possibly can. Make no doubt about it, he's making money off this project, too. But viewers would probably rather see someone as important as Gore making money this way rather than working for Enron or Exxon/Mobil.l Gore has to be commended for doing such a great job on this documentary.

B000J10EQU|4.0|This film fits right into the series of sequals in the superman films.  I must give it at least a four star review due to the use of a non-major star for superman, and kevin spacey's performance, but the overall movie seemed to drag at some spots, and really was really almost to easilly follow, not much surprise. However, when there was action, the screen was always busy, kept me interested.  The situations are classic \\"superman\\" situations with mass destruction and displays of unhuman strength.  Overall though, I was left with a feeling like there just should have been more.  There will likely be a sequel, we'll all just have to wait and see. Rent this movie, or buy it for a discount price, but likely not worth spending more than the single disc price for.
B00007KWHN|5.0|With the exception of Tony Kaye, this album was the beginning for Yes' classic lineup, which was Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire (the best bassist I've ever heard!), and Bill Bruford (and Rick Wakeman who would replace Tony on the keyboards on the next album). While a few lineup changes in the near future didn't really cause any severe problems (and that includes even when Jon was replaced), but this will always remain the lineup they're best known for. Many fans believe that The Yes Album was their first masterpiece. Well, I can't say for sure, since I also liked their debut, and I have yet to hear Time And A Word. But this album is great nonetheless, and definitely a masterpiece. The album opens up with Yours Is No Disgrace. While it's a bit too repetitive for my tastes, and while I personally don't think it can hold its own to future Yes album openers like Close To The Edge and The Gates of Delirium, it's still an awesome song, with great, obscure lyrics, and long soundscapes. I really don't care for the acoustic instrumental Clap; it's just Steve showcasing his talent on the acoustic guitar. However, the album really picks up Starship Trooper. It's easily my favorite off the album and one of my all-time favorite Yes songs. It's frantic, relaxing, spacy, [place adjective hear], everything I want in a Yes song. Then comes I've Seen All Good People, which is my 2nd favorite song off the album. It's also one of their most popular songs, right up there with Roundabout and Owner of A Lonely Heart. Tony Kaye (keyboards) gets to really shine here, especially near the end when his organ effect builds and builds until the whole song slowly fades out. Venture is mostly a keyboard song, dominated by Tony. While I think Rick Wakeman, who would come in after this album, was far superior (and you'd probably agree with me), he's still good. It's just not something I want to listen to every day like the others. Prepetual Change makes up for that song though. It's the 3rd best off the CD, as well as the jazziest and most melodic, and Jon's best peformance on the album. Like I've Seen All Good People, it keeps playing until it finally fades out. Thr lyrics are also great and fasinating.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that the production is awfully dry. I mean really, really dry. Sometimes I have to listen real hard to hear an instrument. But still, that complaint is very minor. I would also like to compliment Chris' stellar bass work (which is also great on all the other albums). I, as a bassist with above average skill, can tell you that this stuff is VERY hard to play. He's my favorite member of the band and my favorite bassist of all time. So buy this album if you're a Yes fan, or if you're looking for some great progressive rock. Though I wouldn't recommend it for newbies (that's what Close To The Edge is for).best off the CD, as well as the jazziest and most melodic, and Jon's best peformance on the album.

B000056BOR|1.0|Artisan has released a horrible recording of a very good, sophisticated comedy that questions the values of marriage.  The DVD I got from the start had poor sound quality, faded color and was actually out of focus.

B000JBXXZ4|4.0|I'll be honest with you. Coming into this album, I was a bit skeptical about it. I was a worried it might be another \\"A Crow Left of the Murder.\\" That album I liked instantly, but burned out on it just as fast and ended up not liking it at all, even getting rid of it. Aside from my personal opinion of the last album, Incubus as had a string of successful albums and produced some amazing records. \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E,\\" \\"Make Yourself,\\" and \\"Morning View\\" are just great great albums. As with any band that makes good records, sometimes you have to wonder if they can keep it up and not dissapoint you.  So, could Incubus produce another great album and move forward despite the dissapoint that was \\"A Crow Left of the Murder?\\"<br /><br />The answer to that question would be a resounding yes. Simply put, \\"Light Grenades\\" is a great album. Only time will tell if it's regarded as one of Incubus's great albums. If it indeed does that, I would not be surprised. I heard a interview with the band, and Mike said that this is the most time that they have spent producing and recording an album, and when they leave the studio they want it to be the best album that they can make at this point in their career. Truthfully, you can tell that this is true on Light Grenades. This is the bands 6th album, and you can tell they are really comfortable with each other and have chemistry that only comes with time. Another impressive thing about this album, is that you can tell it really means something to the band. The lyrics are meaningful, and it comes through in the music. Incubus is not just going through the motions, they are crafting intellegent, powerful and moving music.<br /><br />Through and through, this is all of the best parts of Incubus on one album. Notice this quote from Brandon about tracks 2 & 3 on the album.<br /><br />\\"'A Kiss to Send Us Off' shows Incubus in our most primal incarnation. It floors you but simultaneously leaves you thinking. But seriously, that song puts my balls in a vacuum cleaner hose and turns the power to 12. It hurts sometimes, but it leaves my balls satisfied and clean. Think about THAT!<br /><br />'Dig' was toiled over the most I remember because it is the kind of song that is completely new to us. Structurally, integrally, and fundamentally different. Lyrically, it's a nod to camaraderie. And without pepperin' ya'lls interpretation of it too much, it speaks to the importance of forgiveness and compassion.

Hong-Kong's \\"Internal Affairs\\" is a hit in Asia lasting already through three parts on three DVDs but hardly present in the rent shops and simply on the shelves of movie markets: my original disks provide English subtitles setup but just hieroglyphs appear.<br /><br />However, intrigue based on bad \\"good-police-boy\\"  and good \\"bad-gang-thug\\" cat-and-mouse affairs is developed with traditional Chinese fighting, shooting and murdering at a much more picturesque degree than a Scorsese's very similar story as well far from being short of murdering, shooting and betrayal definitely.<br /><br />Cruelty and swearing substantiate script very much, and a DiCaprio-Damon tandem itself assures a financial gain for a product.<br /><br />Maybe, by including Harrison from \\"Queer as Folk\\" more viewers could in a line of fashionable cinematographic trends be attracted because some artificial love triangle depicted in The Departed helps a little to dissolve a noise of yelling and banging, probably supposed to increase a reality of a Hong-Kong plot transferred on the American soil.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is better than too many others.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I loved this movie. Up until now I've been a fan of the BBC/A & E version. Honestly I don't understand the people who are almost religious about having the novel match up the film 100%. You can't always do that on film, especially if you want to have a good movie, and what is it with people being picky about historical accuracies, come on its a movie, not a history book. The film is pretty loyal to Austen's novel and its not like it tries to intentionally mess up on the period that its set in. In short, don't be religious about things. Get over it. This movie is perfect as it is and I love it, its even better than the BBC/A & E version. Keira Knightley is an excellent actress and one that I look forward to watching over the years.
B000001EXR|4.0|Rain, Childhoods end, Jungle, In the mirror, It never goes away. These are the BEST tracks on this cd. The others are decent enough. Kiss was on the right track before re-forming for their reunion. Revenge and then this CD would have been the start of a whole new kiss chapter. But it wasnt to be. The $$ came calling and they went with it.<br />Fact is that this is one of Kiss' best cds. This coming from a 30 yr kiss fan. I love it! The production of this isnt as good as on Revenge, but they never re-mixed it due to the fact that they shifted gears. but this doesnt hurt the cd, This is in its original form.<br />I really was disappointed with the fact that they totally disregarded this cd and its direction. But if you are reading this and DONT own it, you are missing a great part of Kisstory..
B0002234LS|5.0|I have never been a big fan of Johnny Depp,but I have to say that he was spectacular in this one. He plays as Morton Rainey, a writer, who seems to have some problems that he can't seem to overcome. <br /> <br />Morton apparently is a deeply depressed man who can't seem to get over the fact that his wife has left him for  another man. To top it all off, he gets a knock at his door by a mysterious stranger named John Shooter who claims Morton has plagiarized his story. The name oif the story is:... You guessed it, \\"A Secret Window.\\" John Shooter causes all kind of problems for Morton Rainey, or does he? You don't get a real clear picture of what is actually going on until the last 15 minutes of the movies. It's quite shocking the first time you watch it actually. You invest so much emotion into Morton Rainey and his character, I actally developed an affinity for him, that by the end you are like \\"Wow\\" when you discover the startling truth about what is going on. <br /> <br />Anyway, the movie is a bit slow for the first thirty minutes, but once it gets going, you can't help but stay pinned to the chair..If you like psychological thrillers, this is one of the greats in my opinion.
B000000H5J|5.0|metal cds ever. coming from me, a 20+ yr metal vet, thats saying something. Great sound, production and execution. This has to be FF's \\"White Album\\".. great stuff that will stand the test of time along with Slayers 'Reing in Blood' and Korns debut cd... simply awesome and just melodic enough to make it work. A must!<br />Though i would disagree with the last reviewer (i dont consider this Death Metal at all), the rating is correct!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|i really didn't want to set the bar to high on my expectations of this album, i hate to be dissapointed. but it was hard, their last album aclotm was a great blend of the guitar of the heroics of fungus amongus mixed with the harder and progressive rock of make yourself and science, m.v. to a lesser extent, but yet fresh sounding in arrangement and production. but hearing the ep from alive at red rocks and especially the instrumental tracks they contributed to the halo 2 soundtrack, i couldn't help but be anxious. well, they did it, they pushed their sound forward. there's creativity on here (different sounds and instruments, they don't just defer to scratching and samples to accompany the guitar bass & drum, which is nice for a change, not that the other way was bad), there's some harder riffs than appeared on the last few records, there's some songs with a more acoustic feel, and then the songs that blend everything and really sound fresh. i know what rock music for the most part has sounded like in 2006, and it hasn't been very good. for all the bands that have tried to duplicate incubus' sound over the years none have even come close to reproducing the level of creativity and skill that these guys play with. quick song by song: <br /> <br />quicksand: just an intro song to peak your curiosity i believe, and it works. i think its to slow you down so the first tempo change hits you that much harder in the next song. 7/10 <br />kiss to send us off: this is a great tune, sounds diff. than anything they've done, not way different but enough to give some respect, love the riffs, and the breakdown. 10/10 <br />dig: its a relaxing tune for the most part, the lyrics certainly make a lot of sense. musically its nice to see these songs because incubus puts every bit as much musicality into these tunes as the do the more epic/louder songs. 8/10 <br />anna molly: this song could have been on a aclotm, but thats not a bad thing, its the same band after all, but i love the arrangement, its tight,  some songs have a looser feel but this one pounds from beginning to end. 9/10 <br />love hurts: first off, if you've been following incubus for a while you have to expect a song or two like this on every album (echo, southern girl, monuments and melodies, etc.) i like the lyrics, i like the music. incubus are a complete band, they can write a toned down track like this and have it sound great, and not every song needs lyrics that it takes you awhile to figure out, this is just straitforward. 7/10 <br />light grenades: love it, it takes you back to old days to an extent, but its great when they speed things up because mike is such a great guitarist you just want to hear what he'll come up with for something like that. (the rest of the band is up to the task as well) its loud and fast and should please old and new fans. 10/10 <br />earth to bella pt.1: on here the critism confuses me a lot. this is for one a cool song, and two its different than any other they've written. i want these guys being as creative as they feel and when i hear this track it seems like someone got an idea and they just did it. and i think it sounds great, if you buy the new all american rejects or panic at the disco album they won't have any tracks like this so if you can't get outside the verse chorus verse structure for a track or two consider those. (and for those who have the sarcasm meter turned off, i do not own those discs, you know, because they're boring) 8/10 <br />oil and water: this is a great track, again combining some of the softer and louder aspects of the band in a very sucessful way, nothing to really fault in this song, you can tell they have a great relationship with the producer. 9/10 <br />diamonds and coal: its a pretty straitforward song, definately the most mainstream sounding rock song on the record. and no its not a crime to make a song that could be played on pop radio, its still a great song, its my least favorite as i like tracks that sound like signature incubus but this is a band thats been together a long time and they try different things, some of it sounds crazy and strange and some of it sounds really normal, these guys can write any kind of song their is. 6/10 <br />rogues: another great rocker, again signature incubus but with some new things we haven't heard before, i love how the verses kick, brandon really seems to be attacking these lyrics. 10/10 <br />paper shoes: its like the slow song that they really wanted to try some different things, (kind of like talk shows on mute, the idea i mean not neccesarily the sound), i like it for what it is. 7/10 <br />pendulous threads: i don't what inspired them to write this song or to put in the long intro but i couldn't be happier that they did, this song again sounds very fresh and new and is an exciting listen. not sure my favorite song on the record right now but this is top three. kind of sounds like the mars volta with the sounds and the guitar solos, but thats not a knock as incubus was around first, just trying to describe the sound. 10/10 <br />earth to bella pt.2: its cool that they made these songs and i'm glad they're on here and not just recored and lost. if incubus wants to make a whole album of songs like these i'll happily pick it up. 8/10 <br /> <br />to summarize, all the members are now pushing 30, to still be so creative and take elements of all their previous and put out something new on the same level of quality is amazing. this band is still in their creative prime and i hope it stays that way.
B00008QSA5|4.0|While this album was about Bloomfield and Al Kooper, the real story was 'Season of the witch' (a Donovan composition). Bloomfield had his usual bout of insomnia and Steve Stills came in as a substitute. This track is one of the all time greats. Many of the other tracks are Bloomfield memorables and are still worthy however, the Stills track still dominates.
B000062YAY|4.0|Slayer's music is unique. It's sad. No group plays music with such deep meaningful lyrics with music full of talent.  I think the selection of livier songs on DECADE is weak.  Only two songs from SEASONS is not on the discs.  I think extra selections from SHOW NO, SOUTH OF,or REIGN should have been chosen instead.  WAR EMSEMBLE, SOUTH OF HEAVEN, JESUS SAVES, EXPENDABLE YOUTH,  are not wise choices.  EPIDEMIC, AGGRESSIVVE PERFECTOR, TORMENTOR, CRIONIES, CROOKED CROSS, or SPILL THE BLOOD, are only some of our favorites not on the discs.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I can't remember a time where a recording made my eyes well up throughout the entire CD.  This is a magnificent collection and a flawless technical masterpiece.  This brough John and George back to life and I doubt I'll hear anything as beautiful as this ever again.
B000J103PC|4.0|Meryl Streep is perhaps one of the greatest actresses of recent note.  She is capable of carrying a movie and clearly outshines her cast in this movie.  The movie is in a way predictable, but you find yourself liking and sympathizing with \\"the Devil\\" due to the immense talent Ms. Streep employs to bring the character to life on the screen.  Also notable is the performance rendered by Stanley Tucci as Nigel (vs his villainous role in Terminal) - a good solid portrayal of a loyal second that never questions, never complains in a way that humanizes the woman who employs him.  Nigel is convincing in his understanding of the woman most others hate.  On a broader level, this movie highlights and pokes fun at a world most of us will never see (and fortunately so).  Well worth viewing.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I loved the Beatles when they first arrived on U.S. shores when I was in the 7th grade. So I have a real bias in \\"growing up\\" with them. <br /> <br />I thank the Lord that the great Sir George Martin is still living, because know one else, but the original Producer of these Beatles masterpieces could have done this incredible achievement. <br /> <br />To hear the Beatles magical creations, re-mastered from their original tapes, re-mastered, so we can hear it the way the music really sounded originally.  <br /> <br />If this incredible re-mastering was not enough, Sir George and son put together the songs not in any way it was heard before, but with matching snipits of some of the songs mixed together, blending together, enhancing each other in an absolutely, stupifying, visual way. <br /> <br />I can't imagine how great the Vegas show is this sounds to me like hearing the Beatles again, almost for the first time. But the music is SOOOO visual !!  <br /> <br />This also is the first time I have heard DVD Audio. I loaded it on my DVD player, which is connected to my amplified speakers and WOWOWOWOW. PLAY THIS LOUD !! <br /> <br />So crystal clean and clear and we are able to hear of the nuances of all the instrumentation, harmonies that we have missed before due to the technical limitations of having to convert the original audio tapes to record.  <br /> <br />This project was George's idea and I am sure he is thrilled. John as well has to be smiling with this creative masterpiece. It is the Beatles for the 22nd century. <br /> <br />Thank you Beatles and for George Martin !! <br />
B000EGF0NW|5.0|Lucky is the truest portrait one can paint of tragedy and justice in minds, bodies, and spirits.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I purchased this game hoping that it would be something that my husband and I would enjoy playing with our 8 yr. old.  I'm so glad I did!  Blokus is a lot of fun because it involves strategy but isn't difficult.  My daughter's use of strategy in making plays improves every time she plays.  It's even better when played with 3 or 4 adults.   <br />     We've found that it isn't really challenging at all with only two people, unless you tweak with the rules, which is easy to do.  If you enjoy puzzles, this is a great game because it combines the challenge of a one-person puzzle with the fun of a multi-player board game.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is an ugly example of injustice where a black man in a segregated Alabama is falsely accused of attacking a white woman.  While the racial divide was a profound theme in the novel, the dedication of the lawyer was memorable and has set the mark for many looking for their Addicus Finch when faced with a legal dilemma.  Harper Lee, like her good friend Capote, is a provocative author rendering the organic sides of human nature both in tragedy and justice.  It is no wonder really why this book has been around for over thirty years.   Still today the readers of tomorrow would find it a compelling book.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This show has not had a bad episode yet.  Simply put, two brothers hunt the paranormal dangerous down to make the world a safer place.  The writing and acting on this is superb.  I love the chemistry between the two brothers, Sam is the optimistic and hopeful one, while older bro Dean is a little more sarcastic and wounded, but tough.  Anyway, well worth your money and time.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The release is totally unneccessary if you already own everything by the Beatles, or even if you just own the two double sets 1962-1966 and 1967-1970. It offers nothing new. <br /> <br />So why the five stars? Because, of course, the material it offers is excellent. This album is a new version of an early 1980s release called TWENTY GREATEST HITS which was a compilation of the singles that had hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. This CD throws in the British number ones as well. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a quick introduction to the Beatles, this is it. If you want a little more, skip it and get the two double sets. <br />
B000BNI90O|5.0|For any major fan of Lord of the Rings, these complete recordings are a must!  I loved reading the books and watching the films, and now, these recordings just complete it for me.  They are a bit pricy in comparison with the normal soundtrack, but if you love the musical score behind the film, it's well worth rewarding all the effort that went into its creation. <br /> <br />Enjoy! :)
B0000DJZA5|3.0|The GET BACK album is one of the most legendary unreleased albums in the history of rock and roll. Recorded in Janaury 1969, it sat on the shelf for over a year before being salvaged and reworked by legendary producer Phil Spector. The result, LET IT BE, was finally released in May 1970 shortly after the news that the group had split hit the headlines.    For many years, fans have been clamoring for the original GET BACK to be finally released. Shortly before the death of George Harrison, rumors that Apple was finally going to release GET BACK began to spread. Instead we got this.    LET IT BE...NAKED is a stripped down, retro-revisionist album that allegedly presents what the Beatles (read Paul McCartney) originally wanted LET IT BE to be. Its release, timed perfectly with the publicity surrounding Phil Spector's murder arrest, is of course a slap in the face to Spector. Not only are Spector's heavy arrangements ripped off of \\"Across the Universe\\" and \\"I Me Mine,\\" but Spector himself is ripped off by the fact that his original edits are left untouched.    The album is not totally without merit, however. \\"Across the Universe\\" is without a doubt the set's highpoint.     Beyond \\"Across the Universe,\\" however, LET IT BE...NAKED has nothing new or exciting to offer. \\"Get Back\\" has the ending missing, which makes it sound incomplete. Tracks like \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" are far inferior to the ones on the original album, while \\"Two of Us\\" and \\"One After 909\\" are the same and add nothing new.    All in all, this album is a disappointment.
B000ICM5VW|1.0|I made the mistake of ordering this HD DVD on Amazon thinking it would not be in my local store.  To my surprize I found dozens of HD DVD movies at Wal-Mart for 19.99 including this one.  With shipping I paid over $32.  I WILL NOT be ordering DVD's, or CD's from this site again!  Shame on you Amazon!
0802136834|5.0|Antonia Fraser, David Starkey and Alison Weir wrote books on the six ladies who were (un)lucky enough to marry Henry VIII of England. And while Starkey's & Fraser's books are a delight I think the definite version is that of Tudor veteran Alison Weir. Written in an engaging & yet professional style you are caught up in the world of Tudor England. I especially loved the chapters on Anne Boleyn and Katherine of Aragon. This also includes several pages of pictures & illustrations which are an amazing addition to the fabulous read provided by this book. Buy it, read it & enjoy!
0618680004|4.0|This book mirrors much of the frustration normal, everyday people feel with the religious fascist dictating world politics today. <br /> <br />I imagine, hopefully not in my life time but soon, there will be a great conflict between the superstitious and the sane people.  I imagine that a brutal, crippling war will be started by the Agnostics/Atheists, of which I am one, during a time when the religious fascists are busy fighting amongst themselves.  It will be a decisive strike and will change the face of mankind but it will ultimately fail.   <br /> <br />You see, you can't possibly stop all of the stupidity always. Stupidity is a powerful force and is not bound by lack of intellect or social upbringing but is in fact fostered by an oligarchy of powerful men using childish superstitions to control not-so-bright groups of willing sycophants. <br /> <br />Just so we don't get hung up on semantics, \\"ignorance\\" is not knowing something and there is no shame in that.  However, \\"stupidity\\" is knowing what is right and still doing the wrong thing.  This is often called faith. <br /> <br />All of this speak of control and religion reminds me of the 3rd passage of the Tao Te Ching: <br /> <br />\\"If you do not adulate the worthy, you will make others non-contentious. <br />If you do not value rare treasures, you will stop others from stealing. <br />If people do not see desirables, they will not be agitated. <br />  <br />Therefore, when the sage governs, <br />He clears peoples minds,  <br />Fills their bellies, <br />Weakens their ambition and <br />Strengthens their bones. <br /> <br />If the people are kept without cleverness and desire <br />It will make the intellectuals not dare to meddle. <br /> <br />Acting without contrivance, there is no lack of manageability.\\" <br /> <br />Pretty creepy since it basically says, in this translation, that a wise and powerful ruler will keep his people happy and well fed but ignorant.  You see, when people start thinking for themselves they start to wonder why they are doing all the work and the leader is getting rich.  They start to wonder why they are sending their children off to die in pointless, undecipherable wars when the \\"leaders\\" themselves are demonstrably cowards and are unwilling to send their own children off to die. <br /> <br />Luckily we have great minds like Ayn Rand who wrote so eloquently, \\"I am a man. This miracle of me is mine to own and keep, and mine to guard, and mine to use, and mine to kneel before! I do not surrender my treasures, nor do I share them. The fortune of my spirit is not to be blown into coins of brass and flung to the winds as alms for the poor of the spirit. I guard my treasures: my thought, my will, my freedom. And the greatest of these is freedom.\\" <br /> <br />
B000JK8OYU|1.0|Granted - they did a good job to restore original records to quite a good quality, but they added a lot of garbage sounds as well. I hardly listened the record one time till the end. Lucky me, I borrowed CD not bought it! I would not take it even for free now!!!  <br /> <br />Bottom line: it is artificialy refined to the point of total spiritless though very good quality, original Beatles records reconstruction. Liveliness and pointless...
0385513755|4.0|While the storyline of 'The DaVinci Code' is fast paced, it's predictable and rather preachy at times with Brown's knowledge of artworks and Parisian topography.  Having never been to Paris or had the opportunity to visit the Louvre, I might have been lost in the sea of descriptions had it not been for The Illustrated Edition of this book.<br /><br />The plot can be summed up quickly.  Robert Langdon, a Harvard Professor of Religious Symbology, is summoned from his Paris hotel room to the Louvre, where curator Jacques Sauniere has been strangely murdered.  Sauniere left behind cryptic clues as to the whereabouts of the Holy Grail, long protected by a secret brotherhood called the Priory Of Sion.  Its up to Langdon, accused of the murder, and Agent Sophie Neveu from the French police cryptology division to unravel the secrets of Sauniere's code before the Opus Dei religious sect steals the secret of the Grail; and they will stop at nothing.<br /><br />Though I found it easy to guess who The Teacher was, and found the ending to be almost an apology, the story was fast paced and entertaining in a vanilla sort of way.  What made this book rise from three to four stars was the beauty of the Illustrated Edition.<br /><br />The Illustrated Edition is packed with full color photos of items mentioned in the book, such as a 'cilice belt' and the nautilus of a shell, but also the pieces of art mentioned and photos of places such as the Louvre, Westminster Abbey, and the many cathedrals mentioned.  I believe I would have been lost at times without the visual references, or spending a lot of time googling images.  The Illustrated Edition made the story faster, more colorful, and easier to read.<br /><br />The book is very beautiful.  You get the feeling you are holding an art book and reading a fantastical history, but must remind yourself this is simply a work of fiction no matter how many references were used.  Fiction twists fact even while it exposes it.  Overall, I would say this is a good story made much better by spending a few extra dollars for the Illustrated Edition.  Enjoy!would say this is a good story made much better by spending a few extra dollars for the Illustrated Edition.  Enjoy! <br />
B0009MDPYW|3.0|First of all, I've never read the comic, so if you're a a fan of the comic I would suggest other reviewers. <br /> <br />It wasn't a horrible movie.  It had some good special effects and the plot wasn't bad.  The plot has been outlined elsewhere, so I won't go into it. <br /> <br />If you're Christian (more specifically Catholic) and you don't like your religion messed with, you should avoid this movie.  They took some 'creative liberties' with Catholicism that may not be well received.  If I discussed some of the major liberties I might spoil the movie for someone so I won't go into detail on that. <br /> <br />It was a nice little diversion movie.  If you think too hard during it there are parts that just won't make much sense, so just sit back and enjoy it.    <br /> <br />I felt that the biggest distraction in the movie was Keanu Reeves.  His character was engaging and Reeves did well, but he wore black the whole time and there were times during the movie where I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching one of the Matrix movies.  Well, the \\"world within a world\\" stuff was deja vu too, but... <br /> <br />All in all, it's not a bad movie.  It's not a \\"WOW!\\" movie either, but I didn't feel it was a waste of time.  It is definitely a movie that you would want to rent before buying.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I was 14 when the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan, so I know these songs inside and out.  I'm a bass player, and I've played some of these songs forever in bar bands.  So this project almost seems like sacrilege to me.  Listening for the first time to \\"Drive my Car/What You're Doing/The Word\\", it occurred to me that this sounds like nothing so much as a Beatles dance mix you'd hear in a disco.  I should hate this, and yet...It's brilliant!      You need to spend the extra $5.00 or whatever to get the audio DVD.  The sound quality is miraculous.  Somehow George and Giles Martin digitally scrubbed these 40 year-old recordings until they sound like they were recorded last week.  There's a spot in \\"Hey Jude\\" in the \\"na na na na \\" chorus at the end, where the Martins take out all the instruments but the percussion, then after a few bars, they drop in Paul McCartney's lovely bass line for 4 bars.  I'd never even heard it in the original mix.  That moment alone was worth the price of admission for me.      Somebody has probably already mentioned this in a review here, but I'll say it too:  If they remastered the whole damned Beatles catalog to this level of sound quality, I'd buy them all again.       Edit, Nov. 10, 2010:  They did, and I did!
B000FUTQ8C|3.0|Of the three Butlerian Jyhad prequels, this isn't the strongest, but neither is it the weakest. <br /> <br />The plotlines of this novel seem rushed in places: The saga of Vorian Atreides obviously takes center stage in this novel, but the others get little more than a nod in their respective general directions. <br /> <br />The genesis of the Sisterhood had so much handwaving my hair kept getting messed up.  Or maybe it was the breeze from how fast the authors breezed through it.. excuse me, glossed over it.  The same applies to Norma Cenva's evolution into... if you've read the real Dune novels, you know what. <br /> <br />The cymeks are obviously on the ropes in this novel, which is just as well because there isn't enough punch in the characters to really make what they were capble of or their actions in the previous stories memorable. <br /> <br />The origins of house Harkonnen, if added up, would barely fill a single chapter.  Sad.  So much more could have been done, but it was as if Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson knew they only had fifteen pages left in their quota and wanted to get as much meaning as they could into them.  Unfortunately, most of the meaning was lost, and it came across as comical. <br /> <br />There were a lot of plotlines left unresolved.  On the one hand, it sets the stage for the mystery of the original novels, but on the other hand they feel very much like plot holes that the editor missed.

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|I am so impressed with the performances of not only Felicity Huffman, but all of the actors (great casting).  It is extremely well-written and an endearing film, regarding a difficult subject to depict ~ but yet done so tastefully and so very well.  It is also an adventure across America, which is most interesting and entertaining ~ taking you on an unforgettable journey.  This is an enjoyable film you will want to watch again and again.  Buy it you will surely enjoy it!!!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I found it strange that I had never heard of this movie until I happened upon it when it played on HBO. Being a sci fi fan, I thought I'd have heard more about it. In any event, It's too bad that I didnt see this in the theatre because it's a very fun movie.  <br /> <br />After watching this, I started reading about the series, Firefly. It got such great ratings that I bought the one and only season of that as well. All in all, a huge pleasure to watch. I highly recommend!

B000J3EEBY|4.0|Perhaps I could have given this cd 5 stars as some have, but as already mentioned for the time it took to reach us it doesn't quite reach the stars, where her music should take us. I'm listening to it again as I write this. Loreena is a fantastic singer and I will always buy her music because she will never really let her fan's down. She is that good. This cd is still beautiful. My title is as such because as a example Enya who's music I used to look forward to has not had a decent cd in 3 attempts ( which for her is forever ). She's trapped in some creative block and now gimick which she can't get out of. Welcome back Lady McKennitt, we missed you.
B000J10ERO|4.0|I've got to admit that I didn't expect much from Superman Returns regardless of the talent involved.  Being a fan of his work on the first two X-Men films, Bryan Singer is an excellent choice to helm the silver screen return of the classic super hero, but sadly, the film never reaches the lofty heights that it sets out to attain.  Newcomer Brandon Routh is a great choice as the Man of Steel, who returns to Earth after a five year absence to find that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has moved on, as has the rest of the world.  The one person who hasn't truly moved on however, is Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) who has his own diabolical plans, including one that Superman might not be able to stop.  Routh is good, Spacey is a hoot, Bosworth is a bit miscast, and the rest of the cast, including James Marsden, Frank Langella, Parker Posey, Kal Penn, and Sam Huntington, are quite good.  The story, crafted by Singer and his X2: X-Men United cohorts Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, is a bit predictable but offers some nice surprises while paying homage to Richard Donner's 1978 original film, and unlike many comic book films, has actual heart to it.  The special effects are spectacular, and as a whole the film is better than I had anticipated.  It doesn't achieve what the original Superman, X2, Spider-Man 2, or Batman Begins does, but it's pretty close nevertheless.
B00005V9HH|4.0|I guess by dramatizing about the surprise ending may take away the ooomp! from this movie, it is best if you had a mind free from expectation when viewing this film.Please try not to watch it with someone who gives away the ending,let it build and you will find your self gasping.One the best psycho thrillers ever.i won't give away this film the stars are great, the the movie excellent and the story is filled with suspence,drama and action, this is a movie you definitely must see laterz folks.
B00006I53S|5.0|After using this lens for the last nine months, I regret not purchasing it the day I ordered my digital Rebel two years ago.  The image stabilization feature is better than advertised and dramatically increases the ability to shoot hand held in low light or with small apertures.  This lens is sharper, focuses faster, and offers a wider range of zoom than the kit lens that comes with the DR , and although larger and heavier, is a great everyday lens that stays on my camera 85% of the time.  If you are considering purchasing a DR for everyday photography (family, vacations, etc.) do yourself a favor and upgrade to this lens, it is extremely versatile and worth every penny.
B000FUF6QS|2.0|It all starts as a girl is missing and its up to Woodward to save the day as he tries to defeat a bunch of crazed hippie pagans...or does he?, well, lets just say the hero doesn't come out smelling like roses..i'll leave it at that. I cannot really say that this is one of Lee's best movies nor can i say its a \\"classic horror movie\\"..thats giving it too much credit, however, i can say the movie is strange none the less.Anyways, the movie is well..boring and its portrait on pagans is lets say \\"ignorance is bliss\\", the story tries to stay focus, but, loses in the end. I would rent this movie before buying it to be honest and then you can either buy or not buy, but, at least rent it first. The worst thing about the movie is the ending...a word of warning though, if you don't like seeing cute little animals getting killed in a very cruel way then STAY AWAY from this movie..trust me!..you'll do yourself a favor.
B00005JK8K|3.0|Nicholas Cage stars in this World War II movie about racism and bonding in the eastern front. You get perhaps two minutes of \\"life on the reservation\\" as a group of Navajo Indians are brought in for special training. Their language is so complex that the army figures it will form the basis of an unbreakable code, one they can use without fear of being understood. There's a catch of course, as there are with all such codes - you can't let the key get into the enemy's hands. In this case, it means one of the Code Talkers can never be captured.<br /><br />Cage is a soldier assigned to protect one of these Navajos - Ben Yahzee (played by Adam Beach). He feels silly being a nurse-maid but also torn knowing that he might have to kill this man in cold blood. Other soldiers are less shy about how they feel. They actively look down on the Navajos as being inferior, and one even attacks him, claiming he could kill him because he \\"looks like a Jap\\".<br /><br />Directed by John Woo, you need to realize right up front that this isn't going to be a calm, collected view of war's emotional drama. There is a lot of Rambo-like blasting, a lot of nonsensical fighting without taking cover. Cage is not only stoical about his task - he is almost wooden in his lack of emotion.<br /><br />It's also a shame, for a movie which is all about the skill of the Navajos - that they end up being a side line in the story. I would have loved more introductory material, to introduce how the Navajos were living on their reservation, how they were treated there. I would have liked to see how they made their decisions to defend their country despite that prejudice. I would also have liked to see how they were treated when they returned. That would have really made it more a story about \\"The Navajo Code Talkers\\" and less about \\"Nicholas Cage and his Sidekick Visit Japan\\".<br /><br />I also couldn't understand *why* the code talkers were doing some of the tasks they were doing. Let's say they were radioing the position of the enemy, so the ships could fire on them. Why was this location a secret? Didn't the enemy know where their own troops were? It wasn't like they were radioing in \\"We are about to sneak from position X to position Y\\".<br /><br />Still, you can look at it from the point of view that at least SOMETHING was said about this most valuable contribution of the Navajos. Many people had no idea that the code talkers existed, and once they learned the basics from the movie, they went on to learn more on their own.the position of the enemy, so the ships could fire on them.

6305657947|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. I am on my way to purchase my very own DVD today. I have been borrowing my sisters and decided I need my very own copy. Just like another reviewer said this movie requires intelect so if you do not have that don't bother. This movie is sexy, it has suspense, the music is nice and the characters make this movie seem very real. My sister and my friend use to rave about this movie years ago and I wonder what the hype was about then finally years later I decided to watch it and became hooked! I can watch this everyday! LOL
B000ION23K|5.0|While other reviewers weren't as fond of this as me, I found this little film to be charmingly delightful and entertaining, perhaps my favorite animated movie of this year.  Sure, the message is heavyhanded and sentimental, but isn't that what these kind of films is supposed to do?  And what a voice cast:  Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Julia Roberts, Paul Giamatti, Ricardo Montalban...hey, that's top notch casting.  I was fascinated by the unity of the ant kingdom and how hard it was for The Destroyer, Peanut, to fit into their social patterns, but with deft plotting and key scenes, it all works out in the end.<br /><br />I think the family would find this delightful holiday viewing.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I absolutely love this film.  It has attention to detail that is unbelievable. <br />The backgrounds and art is beautiful.  I also found Mater <br />added a lot of fun to the story.
B000GFLE86|1.0|Like many, I was really looking forward to Peyroux's followup up to \\"Careless Love.\\"  This new album was definitely not worth the wait.  The choice of songs, the styling, the engineering and pretty much everything else here disappoints.  Hate waiting, but I hope she'll take a break and give the next effort more time and thought.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|After the release of 2004's A Crow Left of the Murder I wasn't thrilled with the sound they came up with. They were trying to return to their sounds from previous CDs like morning view and make yourself. They didnt quite make the connection. The CD wasn't that great but I like it b/c I'm an Incubus fan.<br /><br />Light Grenades is a brand new sound from Incubus but I LOVE IT! Love Hurts, Anna Molly, Dig and Paper Shoes are my top 4 from the CD. They still have their true Incubus sound with Boyd's creative lyrics such as in Anna Molly he pronounces it Anomaly b/c the song is about errors/problems made with a girl.<br /><br />Great NEW CD, I give them props. Can't wait to see this concert LIVE!
038073186X|2.0|It is, I guess, brave of the author to try something different, especially since he probably got a big boost in name recognition after \\"Mystic River.\\" And, if you've never read his other books, especially the Kenzie-Gennaro detective novels, which are as good as any in their genre,you may find this diverting. I'm afraid long-time fans will be disappointed because I don't think \\"Shutter Island\\" works on a number of levels. Readability is a problem - it feels like Lehane had a hard time with this. The plot jerks along with numerous stretches where nothing much happens. None of the characters, including the protagonist, is very interesting, and the final plot revelation, instead of providing the heart-pounding \\"Oh my God!\\" moment the author expects, instead evokes more of a shrug and a \\"glad it's over\\" feeling. I almost think Lehane was trying to write a 21st century \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" but this doesn't even come close. There are a million better books vying for your attention.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|There are only a few bands that elict the Pavolvian response to simply pick up their new album without hearing it, just knowing that it will be worth every cent...enter Incubus.  Incubus is evolving, and their new machinations never fail to delight the senses.  Everytime an Incubus album comes out it is so amazing that it makes a fan worry that they have reached their high tide mark, but they always bring something more subtle, refreshing, intelligent, and joyous.  Light Grenades is filled with the same soulful lyrics, utilization of the fantastic talent of each member of the band, and is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  I picked up the album without skepticism, knowing that Incubus would not fail to dissapoint....and they didn't.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I have been a big fan of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies for the longest time. Every moment in them, even in the two later sequels that lacked always had a special place with me and my childhood. Everyone knows the story of what happend with Richard Donner and why he was removed from the directors seat. But no one expected this version to actually see the light of day. Was it worth the wait? That's a matter of opinion but I thought it was really great.<br /><br />The reviews are pretty mixed and for good reason. Those in love with the regular version of Superman II may not like some of the changes in this film as it does lack the comedy and sight gags that the original version had but if you look at this film without referencing the regular version, its pretty good.<br /><br />Moments like Lois jumping out of a window at the Daily Planet and the gun shot moment in the hotel at Niagra Falls were nice additions. As well as some of the opening moments and the conclusion of the movie which differed greatly from what we saw previously. All nice changes and work well.<br /><br />I for one was glad to see things such as the Cellophane S and the KFC worker telling the guy she had his change, removed from the movie. While fun situations they just didn't seem to fit into the whole nature of the film in it's original intention. Which wasn't to be a comedy flick but a good continuation to the first film. Marlon Brando was a nice addition actually. Im not a big fan of his generally but his moments really added something that the other didn't. Clark yelling at his father for help and shouting that he loves Lois really made this all more believable. There was a lot of nice touches that really belonged in the series and now we finally get to see the original vision for the first time.<br /><br />Some omitions I was a bit sad to see go. I did love the moment where Lois jumps into the river to prove that Clark was Superman. The whole rescue scene was fun. And I was sad to see a lot of the Idaho scenes were cut out like the little boy being abused by Zod. Some moments seemed to be resolved too quickly like the confrontation with the county police and their car. It was a nice touch in Lesters version with the siren being ripped off. Here it just seemed to be over passed to fast.<br /><br />A real problem is the movie can seem to drag on at points. Lex learning about the villans is cool to see and all but unneccesary as we really know enough about them that its not really needed for the audience. Some of his playing with the crystals too seemed to drag on for a bit. So be prepared for some long periods of talking and story building but the movie is still under 2 hours so nothing that really over the top.<br /><br />For the most part I would say this was pretty good and definitely a version I would have loved had it been what we originaly saw. You have to go in with a grain of salt here as first of all not all of the footage was recovered and more importantly we are all so familiar with the version of the movie we did get originally that its hard to just forget it and the moments we loved in it. If this had been the version we saw first we would have loved this just as much. In a way I do wish that there could be a way to mix and match the two versions. There were some things I loved that were left out of this one but so much that I thought was great in this one.<br /><br />Overall I say definitely get this one. If you are a fan of the Superman films this is a must have. Your expectations shouldn't be so high that this won't meet them, but do go in with the thought that this is using lost footage from 1980 that has to be put upon us after such a long time of seeing the other. If you see this as a fresh and new follow up to the first, you will truly see why this was so much fun.<br /><br />Its up to you though when all is said and done. If you are expecting the comedy and slapstick moments of the orginal as well as everything you remember justwith some additions, then you may not like this. If you want to see the original vision and a brand new alternative vision of what the follow up to the first could have or should have been (depending on your opinon of it) then I say its more then worth it. You can never have too much Superman in your DVD collections. And you can also buy the Superman II Deluxe edition if you want the regular as you remember it. But I do think people are missing out if they don't check this out too. Its pretty good and I don't think people will regret checking it out.ant to see the original vision and a brand new alternative vision of what the follow up to the first could have or should have been (depending on your opinon of it) then I say its more then worth it.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|Cut out most of the sappy time filler Niagra Falls scenes, put back 15 minutes of Marlon Brandos Jor El with additional minutes alotted to Zod and Luthor and what do you get??? SUPERMAN 2 <br /> <br />Restored scenes offer a look into Kal Els frustration with his lonely monastic lifestyle as he tearfully vents his feelings to his fathers memory hologram and we feel the bitter taste in his mouth as he wonders how a man who does good all day every day for a whole planet is not even allowed even one seemingly rational desire to have a steady companion as does the rest of the planet who he is benefactor to. <br /> <br />Margot Kidder looker as cute as she did in the first one and alot less dowdy then the final version released was remarkably poised and restrained while obviously being very comfortable and having fun in this role in this version at least. <br /> <br />The Phantom Zone criminals and Luthor are less comic booky and rendered as descpicable as they should have been, with their contempt for life obvious in the additonal lines restored. <br /> <br />Yes the ending wasnt the greatest, but not worse then the theatrical one and actually funnier in a way. <br /> <br />This is the version that should have been released and will oblige you to consign the cotton candy product they released to the garbage. ENJOY
B000JK8OYU|3.0|The Beatles were obviously pioneers. Apart from writing terrific songs that have withstood decay for over 40 years, they increasingly mastered creating the ultimate atmosphere to embed their songs in. Voicings, instrumentations, arrangements, production, track order, everything added to the perfection of the song itself or the album as a whole. In this process The Beatles were, in my opinion, revolutionary and refreshing. <br /> <br />Love, however, isn't. It is a well crafted remix of strong songs, but it lacks the innovativity to really transform classics into new classics. Knowing the originals doesn't help, on the contrary. It emphasizes how incredible the original songs were (and are), and how amazing these twentysomethings were in the 60's. By craftily polishing the dust off these tracks in an effort to refresh it, it seems like the freshness has been wiped of as well. <br /> <br />True, by mixing up different (parts of) songs and offering them in surprising contexts, the original compositions are even more appreciated, but that was also (and better) the case on the three Anthology CD's.  <br /> <br />For people who are already familiar with the Beatles, my advice would therefore be to acquire the Anthology-CD's and leave 'Love' for those new to the Beatles. As a springboard to the originals, of course ;-) <br /> <br />Bart (29)
B000H5U832|5.0|This film is just incredible. Everyone in the family should see it and will love it. This is on my personal top 5 all time kids film list and my son thinks its the best
B00005R1N3|2.0|Black Christmas has creepy suspense, yeah. Great buildup, sure. And those phone calls? Freaking weird.  <br /> <br />But it does not have cohesion. Or closure. A movie doesn't need those things to be good, but their absence in Black Christmas wrecks the whole ship. All that suspense and those phone-melting calls are pretty good on their own, but the anticipation of figuring out \\"But who's doing it...and WHY?\\"  is the driving force behind the movie. And what they actually led up to? Pllllllbbbtttttt. Totally unsatisfying.  <br /> <br />It's fitting that this movie is set around the holidays, because watching it is just like opening a bunch of cool presents on Christmas morning, saving the best wrapped one for last, and then ripping it up only to find nothing inside. Black Christmas, definitely.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Don't listen to the comment above from Amazon about how today's kids won't love this movie the way we did.  My 10 and 12-year-old LOVE it!  My ten year old boy, especially.  He watches it over, and over, and over....
B00005JPAD|4.0|I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and thought it was good, tense crime drama. As everyone knows, it's an adaptation of the foreign film \\"Infernal Affairs.\\"  But I think I see another influence, namely, the true story of Whitey Bulger and the \\"Winter Hill\\" mob of Boston.<br /><br />For those who don't know about him, Bulger was a crime boss quite similar to the fictional one played by Jack Nicholson.  Like Nicholson's character, Bulger has a long list of killings and dirty deeds to his name.  Like Nicholson's character, Bulger was an FBI informant who traded on that status to win a certain degree of immunity for himself and his associates (while feeding less fortunate thugs to the feds).  The final similarity is that Bulger had something akin to what Nicholson's character had in that played by Matt Damon, a source inside law enforcement.  The only difference is that Bulger's de facto source was his supposed FBI case officer, John Connolly.<br /><br />Bulger's life is a very sordid story and the FBI's handling of him ranks up with the Robert Hanssen espionage debacle as a blot on its record.  People who are interested further should check out a book called \\"Black Mass\\" (the author's name escapes me).  It's pretty good.<br /><br />I think that \\"the Departed\\" does a pretty good job distilling the often uncinematic aspects of criminal life in south Boston into a drama that crackles with tension.  There are a lot of twists and turns in the movie, and it keeps the viewer guessing to almost the very end.  While Nicholson dominates the film with his mob boss portrayal, Matt Damon and Leonardo Dicaprio do a great job as well.<br /><br />This being said, the film is not perfect.  I have four gripes with it:<br /><br />1.  I don't think it really explained why someone like the character played by Dicaprio would subject himself to the degradation that he endures in the movie (ostensibly being kicked out of the police force and serving a sentence in prison to build his credibility.  Maybe there are police officers who are dedicated --or crazy enough-- to do someting like that.  But the film never tells us why Dicaprio's character would be willing to do that.<br /><br />2.  I also didn't buy the idea of the police psychologist getting herself romantically involved with Dicaprio's character.  I found it hard to believe that someone who is a trained psychologist who correctly saw that Dicaprio's character had serious personal problems, was maybe developing a drug problem, and was an apparent felon would let herself do that.  But when Dicaprio stares hungrily at her and the music swells, the next thing you know, she's on her back. I didn't buy it, and I could hear the \\"mandatory romance for Dicaprio\\" plot wheels turning.<br /><br />3.  I thought that one of the very last plot twists wasn't adequately explained.  What a particular character does provides a shock, but when you think about it, you find yourself asking, \\"how would he have known where to go and what to do at that time?\\"<br /><br />4.  I thought the idea of the Massachusetts State Police having a hard time smoking out a corrupt cop like Damon's character was a little bit silly.  Frankly, I think a police sergeant who is living in a palatial condo (or apartment) with a beautiful view of the cityscape, who has a stereo system that looks very expensive, who can afford to take his girlfriend to five star restaurants, and afford law school to boot would stand out like a blinking neon sign if the police did a cursory comparison of what the man had in terms of legitimate income versus what his expenses were.<br /><br />This being said, \\"the Departed\\" is a very entertaining flick, and I know I will be buying the DVD when it comes out.who are dedicated --or crazy enough-- to do someting like that.

B000002GBK|3.0|Standout tracks = * <br /> <br />ARTHUR* Intro track, starts with an \\"epic\\" (actually weak) voiceover and then the keys and attempts at bombast come in... I don't know if you've ever heard Bal Sagoth, but the overall corny epic feel of this album reminds me of their work. The synths that are trying to sound like horns work way better here than on stupid black metal albums, no doubt. The keys rule this album, the highlight of this track being the set of atomic cricket chirps heard around 4:50. There's also some cool clean guitar that sounds like someone held a mic within a few feel of an unaware James from Arsis noodling unplugged as a warm-up to his set. All around this is a rocking and powerful track.  <br /> <br />LADY OF THE LAKE Total throwaway. Yes, vocals alone can be cool, but this forty-second choral-only track is a piece of poo compared to that amazing moment right before the final movement of Edge of Sanity's Crimson.  <br /> <br />GUINEVERE Lame traditional piano wankery to start, almost too much to forgive after the last track already had me looking for a way out. There's a little respite from all sound, then the ballad crap comes in. It's almost saved by the sweet future synths goofing around in the background, but too lame, too late. There's the beloved/hated (just my personal preference on this particular birdsong) crow cackle in the left speaker around 2:00 - I don't think it's farfetched to say this is a not-too-subtle Dim Mak homage. Wakeman's delivery of the word \\"Guinevere\\" is almost as incomprehensible as Danzig's take on \\"Vampira\\" and much more giggle inducing. This track is all around same-y and something that a chick from another era would probably get down to. The best portion begins at 4:00 when the midget space worms present themselves from their gestation chamber and regale the gathered patrons with their mating song, weemp-whoomped out with joy and lechery in their native tongue. Though this is a track only for the die-hards, it goes outin class, using the \\"slowing the tape down\\" effect to gradually and quickly drop the pitch of the fruity chorus we just spent the whole song begging to quit imitating castratos.  <br /> <br />SIR LANCELOT AND THE BLACK KNIGHT* Holy moly! This is cheese prog the way it's meant to be done! After the phenomenal and manly \\"FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!\\" intro chant, the deliciously dextrous keys take turns with a fervent and testicled singer to craft a fetus-shredding verse. I can't even express how much how the \\"WHOOH\\" horn that accompanies the final beat of every sung line during the verses. This cataclysmic energy doesn't let up, all the way through a blazing keyboard solo that makes the wee space larva from the previous track cry to mommy. The best bits from earlier in the song are recycled, generating a medival prog epic that will stand the test of time.  <br /> <br />MERLIN THE MAGICIAN Opens with some choral nonsense, this probably sounds cool if you are 5 or if you go to church. Much like The third track, just when the first bit of nonsense lets up, our optimism is punished with yet more nonsense. If I wanted to hear clean piano being played proficiently, I wouldn't have moved out of Mom's house (SHE HAS A PIANO AND I CAN PLAY IT SO EASY). Some three-dimensional sounds appear around 3:15 that attempt to save this slug of a song, but they're not really annihilating the faux-ivory-tickling we've heard in the previous two tracks, making this feel like a useless song built around a mediocre solo. Something so imcomprehensibly terrible that I cannot put it into words happens at 4:50; the only good thing I can say this fifty seconds of terror is that it sort of reminds me of a stage in Super Mario World. More volume-filling, mind-expanding laser solos make me smile towards the end, but my smile is shattered and I am plunged into irreparable depravity as the Mario-esque nonsense returns for a torturous reprise.  <br /> <br />SIR GALAHAD I guess Wakeman has a boner for choral intros, but even if I'd had any sort of stiffness, these intros would act as an all too tight condom. After the requisite intro and mellow pre-song nonsense that is becoming a recurring motif, some more nonsense that was probably intended to cause booties to boogie appears, complelling my already flaccid member to desire a safe haven where it can be softened no more. This song is all over the place: not in the worst way possible, but in a way that I don't want to commit more than a few words to the attention-whoring chicanery. Basically, they build it up so you feel like some posers are about to be forcibly removed from the hall, but after the badical buildup, the posers are instead taken by the club owner into the VIP room where they wine and dine our collective sisters.  <br /> <br />THE LAST BATTLE There was a smooth segue from the prior track into this nine-minute goliath, so I didn't notice the track change. Our sisters having such a blast and get wasted on champagne probably wasn't helping my focus, either. Not too much on this mediocre and paradoxically non-epic track that we haven't heard yet. Some vocal scat nonsense arrives at 2:47 in an obvious tribute to Katamari Damacy. This last track is clearly dedicated to nap-inducing rather than bombast; I say skip it.  <br /> <br />Summary Some fun tracks, some duds, and many cool moments. Many less blastbeats than advertized.
B000J10ERO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, though I went into it with some reservations.  I am a big fan of the first two Christopher Reeve movies, and knew that this one had a lot to live up to.  Well, I was thoroughly satisfied.  The perfect mix of action and acting.  I was pleasantly surprised by Routh.  I thought he did a great job, and that the movie was a great set-up for future sequels.  The airplane rescue scene was phenomenal!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Prepare to be amazed. If you can, avoid looking at the track listing before listening to this, as you will simply take what the Martins have done with a sense of awe and reverence. This is a magical experience, I must admit. At times, the flow can sound like nothing more than a medley of the original songs, but when various tracks are re-arranged, altered as you've never heard before, the results are trenchant and superbly executed. All the credit in the world has to go to the George and Giles. Imagine the myriad of elements they had at their creative disposal - they've somehow made it work. Not only that, but the sound quality and remastering are very impressive (it's high time for the original catalogue to be given the same state-of-the-art punch). Believe me, you will \\"Love\\" this cd. It will quite likely hold you in rapt attention for every second, and it will definitely leave you wanting more.
B000021XS0|5.0|In my opinion, this is the definitive Dream Theater album, encompassing all the styles that is familiar to the band. It's fast and aggressive in some moments, balanced and melodic for many more, and slow and sweet in between. <br /> <br />Yes, there is soloing, but it fits in the music. The solos are a journey beyound the riffs of the songs and they bring a level of depth and complexity that enhances the music itself. <br /> <br />And speaking of the music, I hadn't heard anything this intelligent since Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and I mean all four movements.  The idea that they introduce the main themes in the Overture track and even reprise the opening piece in \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" is genius, not to mention all the riffs and themes that are reprised from the song \\"Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper\\". And the fact that the whole album is centered around the key of D--not unlike, say, a classical symphonic work or a Mozartean opera--implies that this album isn't to be heard one song at a time. Hearing it from beginning to end at least twice is a rewarding experience that is hard to repeat (except maybe hearing it a third and fourth time). <br /> <br />And finally, this album has made many people fans of the band. People who, before hearing this, would cite Depeche Mode, Simple Minds, and Heaven 17 as their favorite bands. I've also made a believer of my roommate who's a fan of Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Social Distortion.
B00006IUL7|5.0|A great story and a great performance by both Robin Williams and Al Pacino. I love this movie. One of our favorites.<br /><br />I won't retell the plot synopsis because you can read that above and in other reviews. I will only say that I am not a big Pacino fan, I like him in some things and not others, but I love him in this. And while I've always loved Robin Williams, I strongly prefer him in dramatic roles than in manic comedic roles. This movie was perfect for him.<br /><br />Excellent all around!
0060589280|3.0|Having read Coelho's \\"The Alchemist\\" and now \\"Eleven Minutes,\\" I have two words to describe his work: trite and beautiful.  \\"Eleven Minutes\\" (which refers to the average duration of the sexual act) reads like the Julia Roberts movie spin-off, now transferred to exotic locations (Brazil and Geneva). This script's star is Maria, a naive Brazilian secretary, who seeks adventure, money and a husband but ends up a prostitute in a Geneva men's club.  For the most part, Maria's forays into paid sex sound more like dating in any large city.  Of course she just \\"falls\\" into the scene when she signs up to be a model and earns a pretty sum sleeping with a potential employer.  Figuring out this is an easy way to make money, Maria ditches her regular job and becomes a lady of the night. We only hear of her adventures with two young, rich, good looking clients, one of whom opens up her world in a sexual way, and the other (also rich, echoes of the Pretty Woman movie here) she falls in love with. Hate to be a spoiler, but this isn't the whole story.  It's really about Coelho and his sympathetic view of prostitutes as just regular women (aren't most of us after adventure, money and love) or, more cynically perhaps, we are all just whores. As a novel, it is better written than many on the shelf; fast paced and easy to read, it doesn't eat up all your time.  Unlike Pretty Woman, Maria never gets roughed up, nor is she prey to the drugs, abuse and exploitation of most of her skin trade sisters. Although a titillating post-modern fairy tale about the oldest profession, Coelho's fantasies might better have been kept to himself.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|The newest from Incubus won't wow you off of your seats, but is subtly a fantastic album.  The main songs that stand out are Dig, Oil and Water, and Pendulous Threads but the more that I think about it, there is not one bad song on the album.  That is the beauty of the album.  There are not any traditional standout tracks, but all of them are quality.  The album takes a few listens to truly appreciate the simplicity/complexity of the music.
B00005JNS0|3.0|\\"Cars\\" is director John Lasseter's tribute to American automobile culture. It rolls his love of NASCAR and fondness for the family road trip into a children's morality tale with a little history lesson. The world of \\"Cars\\" is a populated by driverless autos, so the characters are all machines. A hotshot, rookie racing car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who thinks of nothing but winning the Piston Cup has one week to get to his race in California. But a mishap en route lands McQueen in traffic court in the southwestern town of Radiator Springs. The town judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), wants the arrogant little racer out of town ASAP, but Porsche prosecutor Sally (Bonnie  Hunt) wants McQueen to pave the town's dilapidated main thoroughfare instead, in hopes that it will bring travelers back to the Route 66 town that they abandoned when the interstate was put through. McQueen is loathe to miss his race, but the townsfolk and a hillbilly tow truck named Mater (Dan Whitney) may change his priorities.<br /><br />\\"Cars\\" is an attractive film that smoothly integrates two aspects of car culture -racing and road trips- into a lesson about friendship and respect and a little history of Route 66 towns. But the script is pedestrian. It's hard to believe that someone thought a bunch of bickering over paving a road would be entertaining. You can tune out large sections of this movie without missing anything. \\"Cars\\" has a lot of technically impressive animation but really only engages visually at the racetrack. It opens with a bang as cars whiz around the track at the Piston Cup and closes in the same vein, with the tiebreaker race, which is much more involving. I can't say if children would enjoy \\"Cars\\", but, at 1 hour and 54 minutes, it is tedious and way too long. Since \\"Finding Nemo\\", Pixar has lost its flare for clever dialogue and distinctive animation that adults can enjoy too. To my mind, if a film is too dull for adults, its' not worth a child's time either. Pixar needs better writers.<br /><br />The DVD (Pixar 2006): Bonus features include 2 animated short films, 4 deleted scenes, the movie's epilogue, and a documentary about the inspiration behind the film. \\"Mater and the Ghostlight\\" (7 min) is a short film in which Mater gets his comeuppance for playing practical jokes. \\"One Man Band' (4 1/2 min) is a short film unrelated to \\"'Cars\\", in which a couple of street musicians duel for the approval of a little girl. \\"Epilogue\\" (4 min) is the last part of \\"Cars\\" that played over the credits. In \\"Inspiration for Cars\\" (16 min), John Lasseter talks about merging the worlds of racing and road trips, the decline of Route 66, and shares part of the Route 66 road trip that the filmmakers took with \\"Route 66: The Mother Road\\" author Michael Wallis.

B000301YY8|5.0|James Blunt makes a great CD.  His songs seem to be real-life occurrences; I think that's what makes his songs easy to relate to for most people. James Blunt is going to be a big name artist.  I can't put my finger on what it is, but whatever it is, he has it.  His sound is so diverse, he is very soulful and moody, and cries out for comfort. he has a tenor voice but he is not so high that he sounds like a woman.  He doesn't have the best of voices, but it is good enough.  I think the reason I like his songs is because I think I can sing as well as he can, and the songs aren't difficult to sing.  His songs are also easy to play on guitar, and on piano.   <br /> <br />Every song on his CD is special, you never feel like you are listening to the same song over and over again.  His songs have a soft but rugged sound to them, actually his instrumental is the soft part and his vocals are the rugged part, he has the perfect mix of the two sounds.  My favorite song on the CD is \\"Tears and Rain,\\" it tells about how he wishes he could get rid of the demons in his head and soul, and how he wishes he would have made the right choices in life; he only wants a simple, normal life but he can't because of the stupid decisions he has made in his past.  Now he will have to suffer the consequences.  Some of the lyrics in the song \\"Tears and Rain\\" go like this.  <br /> <br /> I wish I could <br /> run <br />  far, far away,  <br /> find comfort in pain,  <br /> all pleasures the same, <br />  it just keep me from trouble. <br />  Hide my true shape, <br />  like Dorian Gray,   <br /> it's more than just words, <br />  it's just tears and rain. <br /> <br />Some of his songs are really scatter brain, but some of them are truly profound.  It's hard to find an artist that puts his heart and soul into every song on his CD, but James Blunt does it very well, it sounds like he is singing directly to you like the song you are listening to is written for you, and only you. The only bad part about his CD is that some of his songs have explicit language in them, but other than that his Back to Bedlam CD is great. I can listen to it CD all day.  I give Back to Bedlam five out of five stars.  Buy it. <br />
B000ICL3KG|4.0|\\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" presents former Vice President Al Gore's lecture on global warming (minus about half an hour) that he has trotted all over the world in hopes of raising awareness about the impact of man-made pollutants on climate change. Al Gore has given this presentation more than 1000 times, using a PowerPoint slide show from his laptop, but this time he is in a large lecture hall built on a sound stage for this film, with his many photos and graphs displayed on an enormous screen. It's difficult to make a lecture compelling on film, and director Davis Guggenheim almost succeeds by cutting the lecture with footage and commentary outside of the lecture hall, in which Gore talks about the people and events that inspired him to environmental activism. Gore comes across as geeky, but, contrary to what one might expect, he is not wooden or dull. It's clear that Al Gore is passionate about his 30-year crusade to combat global warming. If he had been this passionate about the 2000 presidential campaign, he would have been President.<br /><br />The concept behind global warming is that \\"greenhouse gasses\\" thicken our atmosphere, trapping more IR light around the earth, which increases our air and water temperatures. After this brief explanation, aided by lots of huge graphs and charts, Al Gore sets about convincing his audience that this will have dire consequences for our planet if we don't act quickly to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. His concerns fall into the categories of either melting ice or meteorological phenomena. They include flooding, hurricanes, heavy rains, drought, melting glaciers, diminishing ice caps, and rising sea levels, as well as the economic and social problems that these things may precipitate. Al Gore's big charts are pretty interesting if you like numbers, and they include air temperature and carbon dioxide data going back an amazing 650,000 years. He makes his points succinct and easy to understand using photos, maps, and even animation to illustrate abstract concepts.<br /><br />That's the good part. I don't think that \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" makes a strong case for impending catastrophe. One problem is that Al Gore often fails to tell us why we should care. What do these alleged symptoms of global warming mean to us? I was also left unconvinced of a relationship between recent meteorological phenomena and global warming, because the statistics used to support them had glaring omissions and gaps in logic. For example, historical carbon dioxide levels and air temperatures mirror one another, but the current temperatures are not similarly proportional to current carbon dioxide levels. When he claims that air temperatures are increasing globally, he uses year-to-year averages instead of year-to-year temperatures by month. This may produce a different picture -at least for the Northeast, where I live. When he mentions the emergence of new diseases in the past 30 years, he tries to link global warming to SARS and avian flu, which have nothing to do with climate. I could go on.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I would like nothing better than to reduce air pollution. It damages people's health. There is no denying that glaciers are melting all over the world or that we are losing chunks of the Arctic and Antarctica. If Al Gore's predictions for the Earth's ice are borne out, it will mean enormous economic upheaval, threatening social and political stability over much of the globe. The melting glaciers and poles are the best-supported and most compelling material in the film. I sympathize with Al Gore's frustration when he says \\"we have everything we need\\" to solve this problem \\"save, perhaps, political will.\\" But I think that \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" inadvertently illustrates why global warming is controversial. The fact that the Earth is warming is not in dispute, but its consequences are very much so.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2006): Bonus features include an update, a \\"making-of\\" documentary, 2audio commentaries, and a music video for Melissa Etheridge's \\"I Need to Wake Up\\" (3 ½ min).

6305907145|5.0|The information about this film is some sort of weird cross between two versions.  The jacket pictured is of Embeth Davitz who was a member of the cast which also included Alessandro Nivolo and Jonny Lee Miller.  The \\"Discussion\\" portion lists these cast members but the main film description does not.  The reviews seem to be of different versions also. <br />Don't buy this film from Amazon unless you don't care which version you're getting. The product update only allows you to update the \\"Title\\" which is the only thing about this product information that is correct.
0553801503|4.0|Not as enjoyable as the previous books, yet this book still stands out among other fantasy novels.  I didn't see this book as \\"filler\\" as some other reviewers mentioned and it kept my interest throughout.  Unlike middle books in other series I thought that the story moved forward nicely if not in a standard way.  I was a bit disappointed that more points of view weren't presented, but it still works. <br /> <br />If you enjoy the unpredictability and sometimes brutal reality of Martin's past books you should like this one.  My biggest complaint is that I wanted there to be more.  In the end I guess that isn't too much of a strike against the book.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|This release is by far one of Rush's finest. They're a band that has always been able to change with the times and Counterparts is filled with the early 90's synth-pop style mixed with the emerging grunge rock sound. Their lyrics continue to be the most insightful of any band as they sing about the human psyche(\\"Animate\\"), the endurance of negativity(\\"Stick it Out\\"), and the blueprint of our civilization(\\"Cut to the Chase\\"). The songs continue to invoke deep thoughts on the powers of life, love, and relationships as you hear deep cuts like \\"Nobody's Hero,\\" \\"Between the Sun & Moon,\\" \\"Alien Shore,\\" an absolutely outstanding track, and \\"The Speed of Love,\\" while the band's sound continues to evolve with gliding riffs and kicking jams in between.
0765315246|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The premise is both interesting and plausible (if you could put people in new bodies).  The story moves along nicely and its slightly sarcastic tone is enjoyable.  There is little of the political preaching seen in books such as Heinlein's Starship Troopers, which for me is a good thing.  I am looking forward to picking up Scalzi's other books.
B000J10EQU|2.0|I think superhero fans will enjoy watching the movie, but I do not recommend buying it for your collection. The basic DVD you buy in the store offers just the movie and no additional content. Warner Brothers packed the fun extras in its more expensive two disc special edition packages. Part of the reason for buying a movie, rather than rent it, is the appeal of the extras. Good try Warner Brothers and Bryan Singer, but it is not worth my hard earned money.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase this box set  since I already own the first three \\"Alive\\" albums on cd (not to mention the first 2 on vinyl).  I decided to make the purchase based on the inclusion of the Millennium Concert, the great price and having all the albums in the same place.  I do not believe \\"Alive III\\" was ever remastered, so the sound improvement here is very noticeable. What pleasantly  surprised me was the better sound on \\"Alive I & II\\".   I did a side by side with \\"Alive! Box Set\\" cds and the 2 disc remastered sets of \\"Alive I & II\\".  I found these new recordings to sound clearer, brighter, louder (when played at the same volume level), and to have more concert hall ambiance and overall punch when compared to the 2 disc \\"remastered\\" versions.  The differences I heard immediately were Criss's drums & Gene's bass on the \\"Alive!\\" album giving my car subwoofer a much better workout.  While the sound improvement on these first two \\"Alive!\\" albums might seem like a slight \\"tweak\\" to some, the ears of dedicated KISS fans will really appreciate the improvement. <br />  So, for the music fan who does not own any Kiss albums, shame on you! This is a great place to start; four great live cds in one collection at a very reasonable price.  For any KISS fan wondering if this set is worth the money, ask yourself one question, \\"Do you want the best?\\"  I thought so....add to cart ASAP.
B000INAWKM|5.0|This work is for hardcore Petheads, not for music lovers vaguely curious about the duo.  It picks up where \\"PopArt\\" left off because it includes the five videos made after that release.  If you want to hear 2.5 hours of the Boys and their musician-fans analyze and praise them, then this is for you. <br /> <br />The Boys are like the Penn and Teller of music where Chris is the mute one.  However, he is the first to speak on this DVD.  In fact, they say his silence is an act and that he can be chatty.  He has that Junior Vasquez or Frankie Knuckles in him where he's a rainbow DJ that wants to get the party started.  Chris is butcher than Neil.  Neil reasserts his opera/theater vibe that relates him to Cole Porter or Noel Coward.  If you love Neil's urbane, polished speech and mannerisms, then he gives it to you in droves here. <br /> <br />I do have to warn people that this work is gushy.  Some people wouldn't be able to handle so much praise of the Boys.  Some interviewees call Neil's voice \\"angelic\\" and \\"memorable,\\" but critics have called it nasally and whiny before.  However, that may be the style of musicians' documentaries.  I have seen works on David Bowie and They Might Be Giants that were equally sycophantic.  I don't know nothing about no band called Keane, but I loved, just loved, being able to stare at Timothy Rice-Oxley's cleft chin! <br /> <br />Capriciously, 45 minutes into the work, Neil first speaks the word \\"gay,\\" but then he moves on.  This is in contrast to how \\"camp\\" was translated as \\"gay\\" in the Spanish subtitles, so the word \\"gay\\" comes up a lot.  While this work does interview people of all sexualities, there are many gay and bisexual people here (Dusty Springfield, Bruce Weber, possibly the Scissor Sisters gay, and I'll include Liza since her mother's death may have spurred the Stonewall Riots).  Chris says, \\"I hated losing at dominoes, but my mate would dance when he won.\\"  He doesn't come out and address rumors that his \\"mate\\" was his late,Latino lover.  As awesome as it is that the Boys are out, it still seems odd how they want to sweep gayness under the rug. <br /> <br />The interviewees admit that the Boys are not as big in the US as they are in Europe, and they imply that homophobia may be one cause.  Given this, some American viewers may be left in the dark.  \\"Being Boring\\" wasn't a single here, so American viewers may lose focus when the interviewees discuss it.  Their \\"Closer to Heaven\\" musical never ran in the US, as far as I know.  I loved that this is one of few documentaries that had foreign language subtitles.  Still, since the disc is geared to a European audience, I'm surprised it didn't have German subtitles.   <br /> <br />As a Pethead of color, I love how dedicated the Boys are to multiculturalism.  There are always people of color in their videos and concerts, even though the UK is not as racially diverse as the US.  The Boys are also heavily influenced by Black and Latino musical styles.  Surprisingly, no people of color are interviewed in this work.  I am sure this was an accident, but it stands out to those who have an eye for it.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|Yeah, well I don't write many reviews.  And I don't really want to categorize them as they have there own style of music. <br /> <br />Are they good?? No. More like being on the verge of being great. <br /> <br />Some bands tend to play straight chord progressions that are stock.  Nothing wrong with that when playing the Blues but it gets old after <br />a fashion.  Also if you are doing that the guitar must sing and weep. <br /> <br />They seem to have the IT factor and that doesn't come often when you are playing bluesy soulfull music. <br /> <br />For a two man band I was impressed and for me it takes alot. <br /> <br />Been listening to a vast array of noise since to very early 60's and <br />some say I could play a bit. <br /> <br />If you like stripped down music with a sound that isn't recyled this band would probably be for you.  I heard many influences when listening to them <br />and even a few Hendrix like blasts.  But utimately they have their own sound and it's damned good. <br /> <br /> <br />Big B. <br /> <br />
B0007LXPBI|5.0|This is an excelent movie we have watched it several times with our kids and we enjoy it every time.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Anyone who has seen Superman 2 as many times as I have will enjoy this DVD.  The alternate takes and added scenes are fun to watch.   It's a sin that Marlon Brando's footage was not used on the original, it's fantastic.  They re-edited the scene where Superman returns and asks General Zod to step outside.  It's a shame they had to change that, it is perhaps one of my favorite moments in movie history.   <br /> <br />In general this is a great fun for any fan of the original.  I believe the best Superman 2 lies somewhere between both versions. <br />

B000001FOL|5.0|i always thought nico was just a beautiful babe andy warhol had stuck the velvet underground with. as a marketing ploy, too spice them up with some sex appeal. that is, until i heard this album (cd) recently. it's a great, unique record. something very different. she sings contempoaray songs circa 1967 in a heavy german accent. songs by jackson browne, lou reed and bob dylan among others. strangely it works. brilliantly. it's sexy, mysterious, melancholy and timeless. it lingers in the mind. the haunting sense of both sadness and timelessness. almost mournful. quite an achievement for the beautiful babe andy stuck the velvets with. this is one of the  best generally unknown great albums of the 1960s. i wasn't familiar with it and i grew up in the 60s and was a big velvet underground fan. check it out. you wont be sorry you did.

0525476881|4.0|Reviewed by Debra Gaynor for Reader Views (11/06)<br /><br />Colin is drawn to girls named Katherine.  He's a little bummed as his girlfriend has just dumped him.  Her name was Katherine; she's the nineteenth Katherine to dump him.<br /><br />A recent high school graduate, Colin lacks social skills.  He was a child prodigy but now he's thrust into the real world where he's just another smart kid.  Colin is determined to figure out a mathematical formula, which will graph the rise and fall of a relationship.  (It's no wonder all the Katharine's dumped him.)  He and his friend Hassan, a non-terrorist Muslim, go on a road trip with no particular destination; they end up in Gutshot, Tennessee, where they meet Lindsey and find jobs.  Lindsey has depth and is an exceptional character.<br /><br />Colin, like most of us, truly wants to make a difference in the world.  He wants his life to count for something.  After all, \\"what's the point of being alive if you don't at least try to do something remarkable?\\"  Colin strives to be unique and original.  \\"The way he sees it, his Theorem is the last chance for him to be remembered and the last chance he'll ever have to fill that nagging hole that is eating him up inside.\\"<br /><br />This book is filled with humor, adventure and self-discovery.<br /><br />This book, \\"An Abundance of Katherines,\\" is unique and well written.  I'm not a \\"math person\\" and much of that was lost on me.  However, it is a good plot (just stop beating yourself up for not understanding the formula).  The characters are so funny, unique and truly likable despite their so human faults.  The cover is intriguing but doesn't really fit the book.  The cover made me think this book was for young women.  It isn't it.  This is a \\"guy's book.\\"  I recommend this book for guys.<br /><br />Book received free of charge.
B000GKPVT4|5.0|What would you do, if a mysterious plague swept throughout the world, literally killing everyone off, but leaving in its place something new, something frightening, something downright horrible, while leaving you alive, immune and seemingly alone? What would you do, if the undead now walked the earth looking for you, the last man alive...the last vestige of the human race? What if what they wanted was the taste of your blood on their lips? Just what on earth would you do?<br /><br />These are the questions that faced Robert Neville. It is he who is Legend. How he answers them is what makes this a book to remember and a classic within its genre. It is a book of profound hope and despair. It is a book which demands to be read. Read it. You will not be disappointed.
B000001GQ1|3.0|These performances are classic.  To modern ears, Kempff has a delicate hand, and very good sense of dynamics. Lots of contrast.  OTOH, some of the fast playing is a little muddled technically, the notes not quite clear and the pace hard to define, for example in the fast sections of Moonlight and Waldstein.  These are very early recordings.  Perhaps people weren't used to trying for technical perfection.  And his flexibility with pace is a little too radical for my liking. Lots of parts seem too fast or too slow to me. Overly severe slowing and speeding in some cases.  <br /> <br />Oh, and the recording quality is good...for the early 60s. That would not be a reason to avoid this disc.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|We settled in to watch The DaVinci Code on dvd with complete openmindedness.  The critics thrashed it, religions bashed it, but the cast and director had me hopeful.  I didn't know who had done the score, but 30 seconds into the movie a thrill went thru me as I recognized the music of Hans Zimmer and immediately felt reassurance and rising anticipation. <br />If a soundtrack continues to echo for two or three days after experiencing a movie, I inevitably end up owning it.   It stirs (The Citrine Cross),  soothes (Ad Arcana), and ultimately provides an almost transcendental experience with Chevaliers de Sangreal.  Needless to say, this one did reverberate and has been added to my music library. <br />
0316776963|3.0|I read this book because it was our book club pick.  Memoirs (or \\"me-mores\\") are not my genre choice, but I went into it with an open mind.  I found Sedaris to be a skilled writer, but I think he told us more than we wanted to know about his sexual proclivities and drug use.  I think it takes some courage to subject one's life and one's dysfunctional family to readers' scrutiny, but I very soon tired of his repetitive antecdotes.  The members of our book club who had seen him in person or heard him on NPR were much more enthralled than those of us who \\"got to know him\\" through his writing.  After reading the book, I would never see him in person and certainly wouldn't read another book by him.  There are too many good books to waste my time with this author.
B000J10EQU|2.0|I am not sure what I was expecting when I rented this movie, but it definitely did not meet my expectations. The entire film was sluggish & predictable. With the plethora of great comic adaptations hitting the screen these days, I have found that films inspired by Marvel & Dark Horse comics tend to be better overall. If you have nothing else better to do you may want to watch this film...otherwise, rent something else.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I can honestly say, there was nothing boring about this documentary.  It was eye opening and interesting from start to finish.  Al Gore does an excellent job of explaining this science in an understandable way, and I have to wonder if getting this message out was his 'higher purpose' (over being President)...?  I say that because, well, if there's no planet, there's no president anyway.  Go Al, and thanks for your efforts!

B000J103PC|5.0|A simply brilliant piece of film making. Congratulations to David Frankel for bringing us a gemstone of eloquent entertainment that has, in recent years, been severely lacking on screen. Everything; script, casting, set design, cinematography, score, and of course the acting, is first rate and exceptional. A comedy-drama that sparkles with reality but never takes itself too seriously. <br />  Meryl Streep is a super b...h. Not a mistake at birth. She just likes it that way. <br />  Anne Hathaway is the proverbial innocent. Stupid...like a fox, and in more ways than one. <br />  Stanley Tucci? An actor who never looses his touch but simply improves with age. <br />  Emily Blunt is just that...blunt and hilarious. <br />  It seems to be the honor bound duty of every reviewer to find some fault or flaw and sanctify his critique status. Oh well. <br />  Be careful how you recommend this movie! I did so to a Stacy and, thinking Miranda was a personal assault reference, has  banned me from her Favorites List.  <br />  \\"That's all\\", now go see it.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|There are some interesting mixes on the Beatles'new LOVE CD. Producer (and son) Sir George Martin and Giles sample bits and pieces from the Beatles catalogue(like rap artists)and remix and amalgamate the songs with the chosen tracks for the Cirque du Soleil Las Vegas show.  Some of it is jarring and unexpected but one has to remember that this is background music for a visual stage show and just listening to it cold seems a little weird. The jarring part is the choice of songs which is interesting in itself because they don't follow any pattern of the Beatles time-line or album release date periods like their other retrospect albums. A few of  the songs are left intact, some are shortened, and there are some added sound effects. However, it is real subtle to preserve the integrity of the original tracks. They even sample some of Beatles' conversations from the recording studio. One song is just  backwards...SUN KING from ABBEY ROAD's Sun King Medly and it is even listed backwards on the track listings as GNIK NUS. On HEY JUDE, during fade-out of the song ,the orchestral background part is partially turned off, and you just hear the naked voices of the Beatles chanting  \\"NA, NA, NA -- NA, NA, NA--HEY JUDE\\". The best song to this reviewer is the demo, acoustic version of George Harrison's WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS that was on the BEATLES ANTHOLOGY 3,  CD.  However, Sir George Martin has added and composed a string quartet score (like he did on YESTERDAY and ELEANOR RIGBY) to ...WEEPS and it is like a whole new Beatles'song. Overall, there is a lot of thought and TLC behind the making of this album.  Some advanced reports of the album might lead people to think that this may be another STARS ON 45 type medly/album (STARS ON LONG PLAY) from the early 80's that was popular (and somewhat maligned) that amalgamated a few Beatles songs to a disco beat. But this is truly not the case.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|Nanny McPhee is a movie based on the book called, \\"Nurse Matilda.\\" I wouldn't say it was up there with Mary Poppin's (which is how they have been advertising this movie), but I will say it is good in its own  right. I think that Emma Thompson did a wonderful job and the that she was the best person to play Nanny McPhee. This movie is for kids but I think some adults may like the movie.  <br />It is about a woman who comes in to take care of some naughty children who's father is a single parent. If you like cute kiddi films that don't have a whole lot of substance then this is a decent movie. If you like more action/adventure or more drama, this is not a movie for you.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I have 5 of her CD's, and this one is my favorite.  All of the songs are somewhat mellow, so there are no upbeat tunes that jolt you out of the mood.  I think her voice is best utilitized from this type of music.  I already have a copy of this, I was just buying an extra one for a friend.
B000I225RQ|4.0|An amazing tale of courage, fortitude, and a desire to live, despite dire circumstances. The author, Joe Simpson and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, ascend a perilous section of the Peruvian Andes. Near the summit, tragedy strikes when Joe, up over 19,000 feet, falls and hits a slope at the base of a cliff, breaking his right leg, rupturing his right knee, and shattering his right heel. Beneath him is a seemingly endless fall to the bottom. Simon reaches him but knows that the chances for Joe to get off the mountain are virtually non-existent. Yet, they fashion a daring plan to to do just that.<br /><br />For the next few hours, through a snow storm, they work in tandem, and manage a risky, yet effective way of trying to lower Joe down the mountain. About three thousand feet down, Joe who is still roped to Simon, drops off an edge, and finds himself now free hanging in space six feet away from an ice wall, unable to reach it with his axe. The edge is over hung about fifteen feet above him. The dark outline of a crevasse lies about a hundred feet directly below him.<br /><br />Joe couldn't get up, and Simon couldn't get down. In fact, Joe's weight began to pull Simon off the mountain. So, Simon was finally forced to do the only thing he could do under the circumstances. He cut the rope, believing that he was consigning his friend to certain death. Therein lies the tale.<br /><br />What happens next is sure to make one believe in miracles.
B000B7HZXM|4.0|I never particularly liked Rod Stewart. I had nothing against him but I was not a fan. That changed one day in Quebec when I heard a sample from the first album in this series. Since then I have become a fan when he is singing these old songs.  <br /> <br />Like on the previous albums, he has guest artists from the modern, rock oriented world who sing with him and all do a fine job of re-interpreting these classics of a completely different style. The same is true of Stewart himself. He does not have what I would have thought of as a \\"great voice\\" but he does have mastery of it. He makes it great with his interpretation. He's not just an aging rocker; he is a competent artist and musician. <br />
0060920084|5.0|Have been reading this \\"type\\" of work for many years. <br /> <br />Once thought Mr. Bryson funny. Now, I find him mean in spirit toward anything in the USA.  Note that he has decided to live in great Britain <br /> <br />Also, have realized his works are somewhat derivative, <br /> <br />Please read Jean Shephard...as in Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories. And others.   <br /> <br />Jean has no mean streak, as does Mr. Bryson.  I have just come to realize this.  And feel sorrow that I once enjoyed Mr. Bryson.....
B000J10ERO|4.0|Talented directed Bryan Singer (X-Men, X-Men 2, Usual Suspects)resurrects Superman and starts this movie's narrative after the Superman II movie (III and IV apparently, thank goodness, didn't happen).  Compared to Batman Begins, Spiderman and even the first X-Men, this film's narrative is shy of the new standard and even less than Superman the Movie (Donner, 1978), but his message of hope, salvation, and redemption is more developed and prevalent.<br /><br />The movie's technical accomplishments are great.  Unlike the other Superman movies, in this one you really will believe a man can fly.  Singer, produces a messianic  film where Superman resembles Jesus (There has always been a strong Superman Moses theme, but Singer goes even further).  This helps us to see an internal struggle that Superman faces: His love for humankind and in both his super (divine form) and in his life in relationships (human form).  This is a nice and wanted experiment; but, the movie does not quite get there.<br /><br />Why? The story at times falters.  Its long enough to flesh out the material, but the script could have been stronger.  Further, Routh (Superman), Bosworth (Lois), and Spacey (Luther) all fall short in tehir performances.  For Routh and Spacey, part of the problem is that they are compared to the spectacular performances of Reeve and Hackmen from Donner's Superman.  Bosworth just does not pull Lois off at all.  Kidder did a fine job as Lois, compare to Bosworth, it deserves an academy award.  When she tries to appear \\"spunky\\", she instead appears obstinate.<br /><br />Overall, the movie deserves four stars, although I wanted to give it five.  I hope Singer gets another chance (the movie somewhat underperformed studio expectations), because Singer, I think, is one of the more talented directors in the industry and I think can make a better sequel.
B000I5X81K|4.0|I've been reading all of the fan reviews on \\"Awake\\" and they remind me of when Josh Groban released his second studio CD, \\"Closer\\".  People initially complained that it was too different from his debut CD, but most eventually came to appreciate the album on its own merit.  It seems this particular artist is caught trying to satisfy his own eclectic artistic needs while juggling the wants of the fans who are \\"die-hards\\" for the \\"sweeping, powerful classical\\" ballads, most of which are sung in Italian, and his newer base of fans who are embracing the softer, more breezy music sung in English.  When I first listened to the CD, I was concerned for its success only because I assumed people would jump the gun in their assessment of it -- dismissing it based on his prior releases rather than appreciating it on its own.  I have to say that with each listen this CD takes more hold of me. My favorite offering on the 13 track album is by far \\"February Song\\", with \\"Mia\\", \\"Un Dia LLgara\\", \\"In Her Eyes\\" and the strange, funkiness of \\"Machine\\" following.  The Tower of Power horns on \\"Machine\\" are infectious.  Gorban does not always have to sing sweeping classically influenced power ballads for one to appreciate his beautiful voice.  It's in fine form here irreguardless of what he is singing.  There is a bit of everything on \\"Awake\\" for all of his fanbase.  My only criticsim of this album is that the title song, \\"Awake\\", the strongest of the tracks on all three versions of the CD, is not on the main album -- and I must say I believe \\"You Are Loved\\" was a mistake to release as the \\"Flagship\\" or debut single for the first CD he has released in three years.  While the lyrics on paper are beautiful, they sound as if they were \\"forced\\" into the generic, pedestrian melody.  I believe it is the weakest track on the album and he would have been better served releasing \\"February Song\\" as the first single.  Despite, \\"Awake\\" is a good listen and I applaud Josh Groban for diversifying.
B00005JPCA|5.0|After enduring Pierce Brosnan through four films (Of which only one was fantastic), and with the series becoming too formulaic, it was time for 007 to undergo a slight re-invention. Enter \\"Casino Royale,\\" the first Bond film to be based on an Ian Fleming novel since 1987's \\"The Living Daylights.\\" Fan expectations were high, to say the least. My expectations were no exception. Would Daniel Craig do good? Could they change the format AND stick true to the Bond mythos?<br /><br />After seeing the film, I was happy! \\"Casino Royale\\" is one of the best films in the series, if not the best. The action sequences are fantastic, with very little use of CG effects. The plot and storytelling, missing from recent entries in the series, are both believable and exceptional. The many twists and turns will have you on the edge of your seat until it's exciting, emotional climax.<br /><br />Daniel Craig makes a fantastic Bond. Unlike recent actors in the role, his 007 is gritty and violent. You don't wanna make him mad. He won't just punch ya, he'll lay into you like a starving man on a Christmas ham. But Craig also manages to give Bond a more emotional edge, making his version of the character the most compelling yet.<br /><br />Eva Green is both smart, funny, and sexy as Vesper Lynd, one of the best Bond girls ever. Mads Mikkelsen is truly sinister as Le Chiffre, but also brings a bit of humanity to the role, making his villain one of the most compelling. Jeffrey Wright and Judy Dench give great performances as well.<br /><br />In conclusion, \\"Casino Royale\\" has helped resuscitate the Bond franchise, and created the best entry in the series in the last twenty years. Fans will not be disappointed, and non-fans may finally see what's up with Bond! I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Grade: A+
B000IJ79WU|1.0|After waiting so long I was very disappointed with this film. Too many important areas of the storyline were left out. Short references were made about situations which appeared in the original release of #II. If you had never seen the original, you would be totally lost. The chopped-up verison from Mr. Donner is a shame since he has directed other well received films. I should have read the Amazon reviews before wasting my money.
B000B5IPLK|3.0|I guess the executives over at MTV decided that the station was in a rut, so they needed to do something to fill up their programming schedule. The decision was ultimately to restart their Unplugged series, with the likes of Kanye West and Alicia Keys. Alicia's edition came on last year on MTV2 (not on regular MTV; God forbid they'd actually show a VIDEO nowadays), and though I never got to see it, I still picked up the audio version.<br /><br />This album is a lot better than I thought it would be. I'm not questioning Alicia's talent, but I just never could get into the sole new track, \\"Unbreakable\\". For one thing, it just seems like a Game-esque name-dropping affair that goes nowhere; also, she's really going off key in every pre-chorus. Speaking of that, she tends to go off-key on a number of tracks, especially at the end of \\"Fallin'\\" and \\"You Don't Know My Name\\". And \\"Heartburn\\" is pretty off-key all the way through (but I was never too crazy about the album version of that song either).<br /><br />Thankfully, Alicia redeems herself on selections like \\"A Woman's Worth\\" and especially \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" (but on the former, is it really necessary for the album to denote that the song is live? Aren't ALL the songs live?). Another highlight is \\"Streets of New York\\", which I never liked before, but it works better now because it's spoken word instead of a song. One thing I noticed, though, is that Alicia seems to do a better job on songs that aren't hers, like Prince's \\"How Come You Don't Call Me Anymore\\", The Rolling Stones' \\"Wild Horses\\" (featuring Adam Levine) and Brenda Holloway's \\"Every Little Bit Hurts\\".<br /><br />But every urban artist's Unplugged session seems to turn into someone else's show at some point. Remember when Jay-Z's \\"Can't Knock the Hustle\\" turned into Mary J. Blige's \\"Family Affair\\"? Well, the final track is a medley featuring Mos Def, Common and Damian Marley among others, and it's listed as \\"Love It or Leave It Alone/Welcome to Jamrock\\". What it really feels like is a blatant live version of \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\" only, and it sounds like Alicia is featured on it rather than starring on it. Oh, well; this isn't the best live album I've ever heard, but if you already like Alicia Keys, you shouldn't mind picking it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupertk\\".

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I was a bit dubious about it at first, but having heard the album, I rushed out and got it.     It's grand... Old favorites with a new twist... Almost like hearing new songs by the Fab Four...    Vibrant... Moving...    I suppose I could debate the relative merits of this production versus the originals, and all that, but I'd rather just listen to the music.    Peace!    (Anybody seen my pipe?)
0385334206|1.0|Despite what others would have me believe, I do not remember chuckling, much less laughing, at any moment while reading this book.  I just kept patiently waiting for a story, or even a point, to surface, but after finishing the Epilogue I didn't find either.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|Holy cow!  Who pieced this film together?  Dr. Frankenstein?  It's as if two thirds of the movie was cut out before it got to production.  Lots of logistical gaps and undefined characters left me confused at best.  What the hell is Matt Damon even doing in this movie?  His character was pointless and had no bearing on the plot.  The young prosecutor (I guess) and his hapless father; what was the significance?  Even Clooney's character at the end, waving the white shirt, had me expecting him to do or say something to save the prince, but instead, nothing!  Bizzare... <br /> <br />In two hours I saw hints of Traffic, Clear and Present Danger, Three Kings and The Insider in this movie.  But what a lousy editing job.  It's a mess.  I have nothing more to say.
0316168815|5.0|In the first chapter of this amazing novel, we find that our narrator, a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon, has been murdered. Susie's life is brutally ended by her neighbor who is actually a serial killer. But this is not a story of death or the hunt for a serial killer, although that is in this story. This is a story about the healing power of love.<br /><br />Susie narrates the story from heaven, a place much like her home town with a high school like the one she didn't live to attend. From heaven, Susie can watch her family, friends, the detective trying to solve her murder, and the killer himself. Susie tells us a little about what heaven is like but the real story is in the world she has left behind. We watch as her family slowly dissolves and evolves from the pain of losing a child. Each person in the story deals with the tragedy in their own way. Her father tries to solve the murder but soon finds that solutions will not bring back his daughter. Her mother discovers that this loss only intensifies another loss that she has been avoiding dealing with for years. Her younger sister and brother each find their own way of dealing with the loss of a sibling that they loved deeply. Ray, the boy Susie wanted desperately to kiss and Ruth, the girl who was never close with Susie but who Susie passed on her way to heaven, find their lives forever changed because of the murder.<br /><br />The narrative is built by the melding of these stories into a patchwork. As the years pass, we see how Susie has changed so many lives both through her life and through her death. And as all these people deal with the events of that tragic winter day, they all find that only through love and forgiveness can real healing begin. It is the absence of love that drives Mr. Harvey to rape and murder. It is the desperate avoidance of love that drives Susie's mother into the arms of another man. It is the need for love that pulls a family back together and opens up heaven.<br /><br />I found this book hard to put down, but at the same time I found it hard to pick up. There is so much pain in this story that it is hard to endure at times. But ultimately the story is uplifting. This is a story of how love can overcome any obstacle. Sebold writes beautifully and her characters seem to come to life, even those who are no longer living. I can strongly recommend this book.found this book hard to put down, but at the same time I found it hard to pick up. There is so much pain in this story that it is hard to endure at times.

1591840562|2.0|Wow, I am going against the grain here.  I picked this book up with a lot of hope.  I only met disappointment.  The books premise says a lot, leading you to believe that this is a know-how of starting companies and organizations - any types.  And in a sense this is somewhat true.  But this book is not geared for smaller companies.  In fact the book is structured and designed only for those seeking venture capitalists and/or those who are already in the corporate world and want to start their own company.  Basically, for those companies geared more towards technology.    Because of this I was very disappointed.  Additionally, the tables were almost all useless and the exercises were a big waste of time.  Exercises such as \\"Look up the background of these entrepreneurs\\" or \\"Go to eBay and look up this item\\" or \\"Fill in the blank... (where you fill in your mantra)\\".  Even the quotes, although some were interesting, were a waste of space as the book is literally layered with them all over the place.    Again, I am really going against the grain.  If you are looking for venture capital or are currently in the corporate world, this book is for you.  Otherwise there is very little to learn from this book.    2.5 stars.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|A young boy is sitting in bed Christmas Eve and all that he can think about is how fake Santa is.  Well, he will soon learn the truth.  In the middle of the night the Polar Express shows up right in front of his house.  The boy can't help but get on this magical train that is heading for the north pole.  From here on it is a rollercoaster ride, and some times even more fun than a rollercoaster.  The animation is definitely something I could not look away from and is so lifelike you forget you are watching an animated movie at times.  The only flaws in the film are a some what creepy scene with a bum who lives on the top of the train and then there is your standard animation movie singing scene.  But they were good singers I guess.<br /><br />Now if you remember reading this book as a little kid like me than you will not be dissapointed one bit.  The main thing I remember was the book had a great ending I actually liked the movie ending more!
9707704667|5.0|This review is based on the Brazilian translation into Portuguese of this book. <br /> <br />I have been a reader of Mario Vargas Llosa's books since I fell in love with Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, many years ago.  At first Mischievous Bad Girl showed the wonderful narration that makes Llosa's works so easy to read.  He has a fascinating tempo, present in all of his books, which carries the story to the end, without boring the reader.  Indeed he is so seductive in his narration that he always appears to have the reader on his side from the first word onwards. <br /> <br />However, I was bothered by the main characters.  For the Bad Girl is very bad, indeed, and our \\"hero\\" or \\"anti-hero,\\" Ricardo, appears too flexible to have ever had a backbone. <br />So, with a couple of characters that I could not feel sympathetic with, it took me a while to come to terms with the essential question of the book: what is love?  How does it manifest itself?  And the discussion about what's accomplished with this story can only begin at this point. <br /> <br />Is love something that requires total abdication of one's self?  Is love something that needs to be so total as make you challenge your own self preservation?  These are timeless questions and very worthwhile considering. <br /> <br />I have seen in other places on the NET complaints about his depiction of different decades, about data errors regarding \\"when such fashion was introduced in London,\\" \\"if restaurant such and such is located correctly in Paris\\", and so on.  It's all Ivory Tower preciousness, in my opinion, something like Graduate Students' games.   Llosa is not writing History.  Llosa wrote a novel.  He has to be given latitude.  On the whole I think he was quite capable of bringing to mind the essential spirit of the times when he covered several decades in the latter part of the 20th c. <br /> <br />I believe that like his other books this will be a MUST for readers engaged in pertinent questions of BEING. <br /> <br />FIVE STARS.  *****  <br />
0670034711|4.0|What could have been a dry \\"discovery of self\\" treatise or an oh-so-cute \\"Under the Italian/Indian/Indonesian Sun\\" pseudo-memoir becomes, in Gilbert's talented hands, an honest, self-deprecating, funny book.

A great testimony for the saying, \\"Wherever you go, there you are.\\"

B000JJRIP2|4.0|Presentacion: Me decepciono mucho honestamente, pense que se trataria de una caja un poco mas pomposa como el 1er box set, pues tenia la apariencia de una maleta para amplificador o algo asi... osea pense en algo tipo la edicion especial del 1er boxset, una vaina parecida al estuche de guitarra... pero es solo una impresion en el carton plegable que viene, algo parecido a la edicion especial del Symphony. El interior si esta mucho mejor, las 4 portadas de los Alive, y la que iba a ser la portada del Alive 4. El booklet es lo mejor del box set, fotos MUY BUENAS de cada respectiva epoca de cada disco y como es logico las fotos ya conocidas tambien de cada uno, ademas vienes testimonios de los integrantes de cada disco, una descripcion de la KISStoria de la epoca de lanzamiento de cada disco. <br /> <br />Sonido: MUY BUENO... parece remasterizado pero no estoy seguro. <br /> <br />Bonus Tracks: Rock 'N' Roll All Nite del Alive II (10 puntos) y el ya conocido Take It Off del Alive III (10 puntos). <br /> <br />ALIVE 4: Se supone que esto es lo principal del disco, mi sincera opinion: UNA DECEPCION TOTAL, lamentablemente al menos para mi, el concierto es en Vancouver, Canada, algunos decian que serian las versions del conocido bootleg LAST KISS (New Jersey, USA) pero no es asi al menos es lo que dice en el disco, la unica cancion que vio la luz de aca es Rock 'N' Roll All Nite, version que cierra el box set anterior (el disco 5) pero bueno, sin alejarme demasiado del tema, la mezcla del sonido no me gusta para nada, y bueno las versiones son LENTISIMAS, pareciera que Peter tiene baketas de cemento... y en general toda la banda esta lenta, y el sonido en si no es que suene mal sino que no me agrada la masterizada, por asi decirlo.. y bueno el setlist no trae ninguna novedad, eso ya lo sabiamos de antes. <br /> <br />En serio fue una gran decepcion para mi, al ser este Alive 4 \\"apocrifo\\" por asi llamarlo y ser algo \\"nuevo\\" de KISS me moria de ganas de oirlo y de disfrutarlo sobretodo, pero honestamente no pude... asi de facil, y es que al venir este disco con los otros 3 Alive que son unos recontra super discazos, pues la competencia es durisima, no se imaginan lo que es escuchar el feeling de Alive I, la tremenda potencia del III y oir el ABURRIDISIMO IV... <br /> <br />Felizmente KISS oportunamente tuvo el tino que el Alive IV fuera finalmente el Symphony, ese si que es un MUY BUEN DISCO... si hubieran  <br />sacado este como un \\"Alive Real\\" el sagrado termino ALIVE para los KISSeros se hubiera manchado para siempre. <br /> <br />Bueno, igual soy KISSero y coleccionista, osea este \\"nuevo\\" material de KISS quedara dentro de mi coleccion de la discografia original de KISS... total, ya esta comprado.... apreciar y leer el booklet es una delicia completa. Al menos algo bueno vino.

B000DZIGDU|1.0|this is the worst movie about the marines or war that i have ever seen. i waited and waited and waited for something to happen......and it never did. jamie fox is wrong in this roll; not convincing in the least. and the rest of the cast were good, but they did nothing throughout the entire movie. i'd say the best part of the movie is when the lead charachted is getting it on with his girlfriend. that's about it.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|Simply the greatest American movie since \\"The African Queen\\".   And nothing has come along since to top it.    Jack Nicholson's best movie performance (as Eugene O'Neill)  Warren Beatty's best movie performance (as John Reed)  Diane Keaton's best movie performance  (as Louise Bryant)  and of course,  Henry Miller's best movie performance (as Henry Miller)
B00005JNS0|5.0|My grandson and I both enjoyed this imaginative romp that actually successfully creates amusing characters with affect that match their brand.
0618680004|5.0|For those of us old enough to remember when the 21st century was still a far-off time promising a society based on reason and science, it certainly seems that civilization is slowly moving backwards into a mini dark age. These days it seems more likely that instead of spending my retirement exploring Mars, I'll probably end up spending it attending witch burnings or riding a donkey to a mosque. <br /> <br />This book is Richard Dawkin's rage against the descending collective ignorance. He's certainly passionate about the subject, but always backs up that passion with good, solid arguments. <br /> <br />Those with religious and spiritual beliefs may be put off by the title. I admit that I was a bit hesitant to read it. I LIKE my beliefs. But the main message I got from the book is that if you really are a seeker after the Truth then you must be prepared to question even your most cherished beliefs. Use the brain \\"God\\" gave you. <br /> <br />
B0000CBY24|5.0|I originally saw this film in the theater and was so impressed by it that I bought the VHS as a present for a friend.  We watched it with several other people and everyone enjoyed it immensely.  It shows the strength and persistence of a young girl against the traditions of her community and how she is finally recognized for her tremendous spiritual power.  I highly recommend this film.
B00005QIPH|2.0|Always trying to find something new and interesting, and with all the accolades this band receives, I decided to give The Strokes a chance. And like so many before, I was left unimpressed.  <br /> <br />Unlike other reviewers, I fail to see how this band can be considered revolutionary. Uninspired, repetitive, and whiney 3-chord rock was pioneered well before The Strokes came around.  <br /> <br />High praises demand high performance, and unfortunately, the search for the next great rock band will continue.
B00000IMTF|5.0|I think the existing reviews pretty much say it all but I would like to add the following -<br /><br />Not only is Rising the best Rainbow album, I think it is the single best example of Ritchie Blackmore that exists. Even more so than any Deep Purple release where, no matter how dominant Blackmore was, he still had to conform a little to his bandmates. After all, Deep Purple was a BAND, Rainbow was Blackmore's project.<br /><br />The only problems I have are actually what happened after this album was released....the fact that he apparently stopped playing the magnificent 2nd side (Stargazer & A Light In The Black) because I have never heard recorded live versions of either and this tour was the only one I remember them being played at all!!<br /><br />And, more importantly.....WHY did he push Rainbow more and more into pop-rock after Dio left!! By \\"Straight Between The Eyes\\" it was hard to recognize as the same band. Was rock star lite Joe Lynn Turner REALLY that much of an influence?? Apparently so.<br /><br />In my humble opinion Blackmore should just have left well enough alone because I also happen to consider this one of the 10 GREATEST hard rock albums EVER recorded!! 'Nuff said!!
B000I5X80G|4.0|Six, good sound quality tracks that Neil Young & Crazy Horse had played at - reportedly - two gigs at the Fillmore East in 1970 and 1973. To me surprise, I didn't recognize - not one of these songs. Guess they're all unreleased material - or maybe some of Neil Young's deep album cuts. But the tunes that I definitely dug the most were &#34;Down By The River&#34;, &#34;Wondering&#34; and the sixteen-minute ass-kicking &#34;Cowgirl In The Sand&#34; (possibly the CD's best cut). Basically, just superbly played singer-songwriter album rock. Line-up: Neil Young - guitar & vocals, Danny Whitten (R.I.P.) - guitar & vocals, Billy Tabot - bass, Jack Nitzsche - piano and Ralph Molina - drums. A should-have / must-own for most older Neil Young fans.
B000H7JCG4|1.0|Yeah so these dvds blow.  I love 90210 more than anything and I was stoked for the dvds.  I knew that the original music would be gone and i was mad about that but I got them anyway...not knowing that the music was the least of the problems.  These DVDs are missing parts of scenes.  I think that its criminal for paramount to sell them this way.  I know this because I have all of the episodes recorded on tape and I compared them scene for scene.  The DVDs are totally incomplete.  I will never buy another season.  Some of the episodes are missing scenes that help make the whole show to make sense.  These dvds make me not want to buy any show on DVD ever again.  I will stick to my tapes for other seasons.  Yeah and the music is totally off too...   these suck and i don't think companies should be allowed to make so much money on a cheap imitation.
B000J103PC|4.0|This movie is fun and entertaining, and a big chunk of that is provided by Meryl Streep. The role of Miranda sounds like a job for Central Casting: a heartless villianess who is part Diane Sawyer and part Cruella de Ville. Streep takes this role and imbues it with astonishing shades and color while never losing sight of Miranda's uncompromising steeliness. There is a scene in the movie in which Streep merely LOOKS at another character, and that look says more than a monologue could. There is also a fantastic speech Miranda gives Andie that is already a bit of a classic.  <br /> <br />The movie benefits from many supporting performances, including Stanley Tucci in a wonderful, endearing role. The weakness of the film was in the casting of, and performance of, Anne Hathaway. Hathaway is certainly talented, but is miscast here, and her performance is languid where it should be harried, and disaffected where it should be transfixed. That's why the movie is \\"good\\" instead of \\"great\\" - a more aptly cast sparring partner would have given Streep and Tucci far more fire to play against.
0143034901|3.0|Based on some of the reviews you'd think this was one of the greatest novels in history. It is interesting, funny in places, and well written for the most part. However the use of coincidences on coincidences and the 'hero's' constantly rushing out into the rain, or snow, or dark, with no real plan in mind gets to be tiresome. In the end I found the psychotic police inspector and the delusional ex-spy the most sympathetic characters in the book.<br /><br />I enjoyed some of it, really disliked some of it. So I guess I'd say that it is inconsistent and difficult at times.<br /><br />One thing is that Barcelona is not, in my opinion, nearly as interesting as this book and others make it sound. I tried to spend a month there a couple of years ago and got bored in 10 days. That might be just me, but I have friends who live in Spain who also feel Barcelona is over rated.
0618680004|3.0|Richard Dawkins is a brilliant evolutionary scientist who has written on a wide array of subjects.  He long ago left the laboratory for combat in the public and political arenas and is heard regularly on the air discussing everything from evolution to the chemical basis for emotions.  Lately, he and other scientists have become fascinated (obsesssed?) with religion.  Despite his genius, he is unable to keep his foot out of his mouth.  One recalls his absurd idea of calling atheists \\"brights\\", a notion ridiculed by all sides for its smugness and disastrous reception. Then there is the matter of his interference in the 2004 Presidential race in Ohio that cost John Kerry the prize.  After the Pope issued a statement in support of evolution, Dawkins criticized it as hypocritical. Get the picture? Now he is at is again, preaching to the faithful on the sins of religion - or should I say conservative Christianity since, for some odd reason, other wacky religions seem to elude the brunt of his wrath.    <br /> <br />He will not convert a soul and from the tone of it couldn't care less. He is preaching solely to the choir and his message is startling in its bluntness - religious thought deserves no respect. In fact it is our duty to actively oppose it any way we can - a new Crusade? This approach, by the way, is exactly opposite from scientists who DO make a difference - Sagan, Hawkings, Gould, even Einstein. They reach the very audience Dawkins so disdains and manage to change the public debate if not alter minds. Everyone praising this book should realize that NO religious person is going to suddenly adopt dogmatic atheism upon reading this diatribe. As a textbook on Atheism 101, it gets an \\"F\\". By insisting that evolutionists must also adopt a leftist political agenda and atheism he manages to drive away even more would-be allies.   <br /> <br />Alas, Dawkins suffers from a \\"delusion\\" that seems to affect many smart folks: Their mastery of one field qualifies them as anexpert in all. The idea of a danger from (conservative Christian) religion has become a cottage industry despite the fact that the foot soldiers of the Scientific Revolution were European Christians and Jews. His argument is an important one - how does religious thought hinder the cause of science? What's galling are his rotten methods. He practices the very thing he criticizes others for  - picking and choosing only the evidence that bolsters his argument. He walks us through the sins of the Bible (mainly Old Testament) having evidently studied the Scriptures in depth (an oddity I've noted numerous times). We read tales of cruelty and evil, irrationality, godly whim and justification for just about any awful act ever done. Yet Dawkins would condemn those who point out numerous cases of scientific error or outright fraud as \\"evidence\\" of a corrupt system.  Politically he is conventionally left-liberal, a walking GUARDIAN editorial - denouncing Bush & Company, calling for a boycott of Israel, bashing the War on Terror while offering platitudes about Arab thugs (As a humanist I just don't get it.)  As I said in my description, he is his own worst enemy and this tome is all the evidence you need.
B000JJRIO8|1.0|I am sooooo tired of hearing these cut and paste albums using Tupacs voice. Searching under Tupacs bed for lyrics he would never had used when he was alive and then adding a super commercial guest to the song does not make the song good. Pac most likely would have never done songs with the majority of the people on the album. Don't get duped into buying this \\"clone\\" of a Tupac album. Check out Pac's first two album's 2pacalypse now and strictly for my N.I.G.G.A.Z for real tupac albums.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|Without hesitation, this film has been one the best achieved ones of the decade; not only because the formidable directorial accuracy (the best film of Petersen after his masterpiece Das Boot) ; there also other highlights such the towering performance of Eastwood as the agent who failed to protect JFK thirty years ago and the breathtaking acting of John Malkovich as the killer, the script is sharp and incisive and explores the undermined conscious filled of a strong sense of missed responsibility at the moment to avoid the inevitable murder in 1963. So in this brilliant thriller we assist once to a cat and mouse game in which one of them will have to fail in order to redeem himself or fail again.<br /><br />Tense, absorbing and well made thriller.
B000B5SEA2|2.0|This is probably the worst version of the best movie ever made. I give two stars instead of one because the movie in it's essence is fabulous, the print is just shameful. You can't read some of the title cards as they are copied to largely to fit on the normal television screen. The quality of the transfer is so bad it can be hard to watch. Considering the restored/authorized version exists, no one should ever purchase the \\"Hollywood Classics\\" print. The restored version looks fantastic, has interesting featurettes about the making of the film, has title cards you can read, and has detailed descriptions of the scenes that aren't included in the film as they have disappeared through damage/fire/degredation. If you want to purchase this film, do yourself a huge favor and buy the restored version so you can actually watch the film.
0783233477|4.0|After the superb cult movie \\"Devil's advocate\\" of 1997, we return to a renowned confrontation that claims the life of a industrial billionaire and emerges from the ashes of darkness in human form. Until here everything's fine but the lines of the personage of this hellish character are extremely smoothed. The character loses starriness, perversity and credibility. On the other hand think in these actors: Malkovich or Irons; both of them have the credentials to impress this sinister presence the required specific weight. Pitt simply was not the most adequate actor for this role and so, the movie shines due Hopkins once more; this necessary counter weight was fundamental to create the dramatis personae. Finally, the movie seems to strand and explores common places that have nothing to do with the initial premise; to my mind this script deserved to be in hands of a major expert director,who knew to handle with this material, I would have suggested three names: Alan Parker, David Lynch or David Fincher.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|Unlike his prior albums, which had a bit of a \\"pop\\" twist... this album has a different feel.  You get a real sense of soul, sophistication, maturity... even warmth, as if the artist was inviting you into that moment of his thoughts.  Like most albums, there are some better songs vs. others... I adore tracks #1, #10 and #12.   <br /> <br />I guess if you want a gauge of what my taste is like... and whether it matches your preferences, the album I'm currently loving is: Joshua Radin and the albums I still love are James Taylor, Chantal Kreviasuk and Cat Stevens.
0060595183|5.0|This book gives insightful accounts of Huxley's psychedelic experiences and his personal philosophy that developed therefrom.  He describes his trips with a detailed honesty that would be dangerous today.  His visions and moods come alive under his gifted prose.  A must read for any post modern or futuristic philosopher.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I bought this album without previewing it...The only song I had heard was Anna Molly on the radio. I thought the song was alright. Honestly, if I was not an already established fan of Incubus I probably would not have bought this CD. The last album had parts I loved and parts I hated and wasn't horrible, but it just let me down so much after Morning View.  <br />This album more than makes up for it. I think it's what ACLOTM was trying to be, but much more polished and inventive. And I try to give credit to Brandon for his lyrics, I know he tries, but sometimes they are just cringe-worthy. They're much better here. All in all, I was floored by just how consistently good this CD is.  <br />I have to say I miss the percussion, but I give them props for branching out on other instruments, like piano and strings and having more of a variety instead of just straight metal.  <br />My favorite song is Light Grenadeas for the sheer fun of it.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies where after you are finished watching it, you feel good about life, about the power of the human spirit. Andy Dufresne who is accused of murder and sent to prison. This is the story of his life in prison and how he didn't get eaten up by the system. How he kept his hope and his will to live alive. If you haven't seen this movie you will come away moved, on how good men can still be good in an evil situation.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman narrating as Red gives the film a classic feel to it, his voice sounds like a grandfather's voice, and in narrating the story from his point of view and not Andy's, you get the feeling of tribute. This movie is a classic and belongs in any good collection.
B000001EGA|5.0|Elton was just a singles machine, when this album came out. But he used all those singles to guarantee an audience for this brilliant, very uncommercial masterpiece. The album debuted at number one, but people expecting more \\"Daniel\\" or \\"The Bitch Is Back\\" were undoubtedly shocked, but hopefully not disppointed. This album has it all. It rewards the true Elton John fans who waited through numerous commercial hits for an album worthy of his earlier work. As if inspired by the story line, his early career with Bernie Taupin, Elton and Bernie seemingly go back in time and come up with just an incredible album as good as anything he had ever done to that point, and miles better than anything he would ever do again.  <br /> <br />The bonus tracks include two number one monster singles. Not bad for bonus tracks.
0671042858|5.0|This book is very chilling.  It makes you look behind your back in your own comfort of your home.  The book is a little slow, but it was worth every minute of it.  Trishia is a loving character that is a very interesting 9-year-old girl.  I could not put this down.  How about you?
B000001EGE|4.0|Something changed between Madman Across The Water and Honky Chateau. The songs are still great, but the goal appears to be nothing but radio airplay from this point forward. <br /> <br />\\"Rocket Man\\" and \\"Honky Cat\\" were great singles, of course. My favorite from the album is \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.\\" I've always liked \\"Hercules\\" as well. All in all, a solid effort. But if you were a fan of Elton John, Tumbleweed Connection and Madman Across The Water, Honky Chateau seems a little hollow.
B000J103X4|5.0|This album is good from start to end and for me my favorite song was Doc's Advocate because it reminded me of start from scratch on the first GAME CD!!
B000001DQI|5.0|Elton was so prolific at this point that he could release 5 studio albums in 3 years, a live album, a movie sound track and still have enough for a two record set. This one is a keeper, with songs that could have fit in on any of his earlier albums. (I'm thinking \\"Danny Bailey\\" and \\"Roy Rogers\\" on Tumbleweed Connection, and \\"Harmony\\" for Elton John, to name a few\\") There are, of course, the obligatory monster singles \\"Good Bye Yellow Brick Road,\\" \\"Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting,\\" \\"Benny And The Jets,\\" and the single that never was \\"Candle In The Wind.\\" What sets this album apart is the opening \\"Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding,\\" an Elton staple in his 70's concerts. All in all, this is definitely his best.
0060899190|5.0|What began as an art project has, I think, become a phenomenon...everywhere I go online these days it seems like Warren and his postcards are being talked about.  From m perspective, PostSecret is a wonderfully innovative idea that I think will continue to have an impact on people for years to come!  There is something very moving about opening up a book and seeing the innermost feelings of others...some that are so spot on to how one has felt in the past and others so alien as to break one's heart...but all are inspiring in their own way.  You get humor (some of these are funny beyond description), heartwarming, and even heart-wrenching...they run the gamut of human emotion and drag the reader (willingly and happily) along for the ride.  I think what is also great about PostSecret is that it makes for great gift giving...it's private, yet it's public and there is something in there for just about everyone.  Warren's book would, most certainly, make a great coffee table book and has the potential to be the fodder for much conversation between families and friends.  I'd recommend this without hesitation and I'll definitely be adding a copy to my permanent library.  Wonderful stuff...I give it a solid A!  There is something universal about this book...I think we can all see a bit of ourselves somewhere in the book and knowing that someone else shares our secret is one of the best feelings there is!
B000001DQG|4.0|After the bombastic Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Caribou makes no attempt to match the previous album's power. Instead, Elton makes a very low key album symbolized by the ballad \\"Pinky.\\" Perhaps influenced by the cold winterland where it was recorded, Elton makes an album here that seems like it was designed to be listened to in front of a roaring fireplace, with a glass of wine or two. Fans that expected more \\"Benny And The Jets\\" were undoubtedly disppointed, but fans of Tumbleweed Connection and Madman Across The Water can find a lot to listen to here.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I have purchased each YES DVD currently available.  Having grown up with YES in the 70's at their peak, the initial DVD's were a disappointment. However, I came to learn it was not the band, it was mostly my expectations to see 1970's YES on DVD.  We all grow older. Coming to realize this, I updated most of my reviews.  <br /> <br />However, this DVD is something VERY special. Not only is it the only one that has \\"Close to the Edge\\" from the album of the same name, but it contains a <br />large bundle of their most \\"known songs by folks that are not even YES fans\\". <br />If you grew up in the 70's, you WILL know these songs.  For even the Mild YES fan, if you were thinking of buying ONE DVD, this is it. <br /> <br />They have a young Orchestra to back them up, and even they are in to the <br />music. Steve is at the best I have seen him in years!  He even smiles a few times.  Jon is just having a great time doing this concert.  The bulk of the audience is indeed Late baby-boomers (going from 1942 to 1963 officially, I was born near the end of the boom.  You can also tell from Grey and male pattern baldness kicking in :). The audience is having a great time.  You can just feel the energy, and I wish to God I was there at that show.  The video quality is excellent.  No extra video effects, constant switching every 3 seconds (God, do I hate that. Producers just don't get that we want to experience as close to \\"being there\\" as possible.).  This is indeed produced just like that.  I love this DVD, and because we don't know how long they will last, or the DOg could eat it, or Kids get at it, I purchased 2 as I did with Pink Floyds Pulse. Now that is another disk that is just totally Awesome.   If you have seen it and agree, this YES disk is the \\"Pulse\\" of YES. (O.K. minus the lighting show, <br />but Pink Floyd was always infamous for their lighting design.). <br /> <br />My reviews sometimes draw criticism as being too harsh.  Perhaps. <br />But that says something aboutwhen I make a strong buy recommendation. <br />If it isn't right, I don't like to buy it. IMHO, everything needs to be <br />right. The band, the songs, the production video and audio. Yes is class, <br />and always has been.
B00067ZONA|4.0|What \\"platinum\\" collection would not include \\"In the Cage\\" or \\"Squonk\\", either of which could arguably be the best song Genesis ever made?  I agree with another reviewer that there isn't anything here I would necessarily cut, but with such strong material left on the cutting room floor, they could have squeaked out a fourth CD to the set.  In any case, this is a must-have for any die-hard Genesis fan.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|An interesting twist on some of the greatest rock songs ever written. George Martin and his son Giles work a lot of magic but at the end of the day it comes off as nothing more than an interesting listen and a novelty. When I first listened to it, my first thought was \\"this is like Stars on 45\\", a Dutch production effort that released a long Beatle medley back in the early 80's (it was actually quite good). I'm sure the Martin & Son's remixed, blended and interwoven music works well when it's layed in against the visuals of the play. So the CD by itself just might be out of context but by itself it falls a little flat after the first couple of listens. **BnB Beatles Depot**
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I have seen both the broadway and movie versions of Rent. Although I most definitely prefer the stage presentaion of Rent,I have to acknowlegdge the mastery of the film presentation. The spirit of the stage presentation is very well conveyed in the film medium. I was certainly dissapointed to see that some scenes were cut, but the scenes removed admitedly contributed to the flow of the story... at least in some aspects. I higly recommend the film presentation of Rent but I urge anyone who has the opportunity to see the broadway presentation of Rent to take advantage of a rare chance-- it is truly rewarding.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I love this show!! I only started watching this show last year, mainly coz i wanted to see it from the beginning, not in a hap hazard way. A friend of mine has the entire series, so i used to just borrow it from him and watch it. Ever since then, ive wanted to buy the entire set for myself, but didnt coz, in my opinion, the other set was not worth it. box set didnt look that great, and no extras whatsoever. And worst of all, those discs were dual sided, i hate dual sided discs, real nuisance to maintain!! But when i read abt this a month ago on a dvd news site, i knew i had to get this!! I ordered this set last week, should be here next week, shipping takes a long time, as i live in the UK. oddly enough, there is no information anywhere about a region 2 UK release. But that doesnt affect me in the least bit, as i have a multi region dvd player, and frankly, region 1 versions are almost always superior to the region 2 releases, not to mention cheaper! Lucky Americans!! The packaging is awesome, superb product design!! <br /> <br />Cant wait!!!
0440213525|1.0|I hated this book. I'm not one to write a review, but I felt a desperate need to write one for this book. By the end I hated the kid, I hated the lawyer, and I hated the Juvenile judge. Why didn't the kid just tell what he knew at the beginning of the book? Because then you have no story and you can't fill up over 400 pages. The bad guys turned out to be law enforcement people who were only trying to solve a mafia murder. It didn't make sense. The only redeeming feature was I got the book for free. Anything above that would have been too much to pay.
0307346609|5.0|Similar to other reviews I kept hoping the book wouldn't end. It was just that good.  The variety of stories, the traveling the author did to get the stories, the heroes and some villians interviewed. Wow.  Can't wait for the next book and the movie is highly anticipated.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000JK8OYU|1.0|What is the point to this thing?  It is disturbing to listen to, what's next, rap mixes? Disco mixes?  I grew up in the 60's, I'm a purist and enjoy the Beatles music as they intended it to be listened to.  I can't imagine Paul and Ringo blessed this.  Why don't they release the fan club Christmas album? Hey Jude 3:58?  I don't think so.
B000JVT09C|5.0|The previous reviewer is dead wrong! All the special features on the regular dvd are on the Blu Ray disc!!! It has really good picture quality as well.
0195067142|4.0|Best first hand memoir of WWII and written with excelllence.
B000002UC5|4.0|It is impossible for me to separate this music from the time it was released and the events surrounding it.  For much of the world, including me, this album announced (literally) the breakup of Beatles.  So I had the paradox of listening to a new album by a Beatle while coming to grips with the horrible truth that the Beatles were no more.  Also, I had no sooner bought this album when Let It Be hit the racks.  In a way, those to albums are inexorably linked in my psyche, not that they are similar in any respect...they are most certainly NOT! <br /> <br />Let's remember how things were in those days.  At the time of this release, Abbey Road had only been on the shelfs for 6 months.  In six short months, Beatlefans had traveled from the beauty and magic that was Abbey Road to the harsh reality that it was all over and this was what we had now.  It was a bitter pill. <br /> <br />Does that mean I didn't like this album?  Actually, no, I really did enjoy it.  I got a peek into the total musical mind of McCartney, warts and all.  I found he was a really good guitar player (not really common knowledge at the time), and that he could really rock out, even on material that was fairly insubstantial.  As has been duly noted in other reviews, there were only a few \\"songs\\" on the album that were really worthy of the standard he'd set with the Beatles, but it was interesting to get the total musical personality of McCartney.  Though he was undoubtedly the Beatles' MD (musical director), it was still a group, and he had little say in the production of other members' songs, especially at the end.  So it is evident on this album that he is enjoying the loose, carefree, relaxing freedom he now had.  No doubt, especially with hindsight, the final year of Beatles sessions had been fraught with tension, ego, bad vibes and endless bickering and disagreement.  Martin got sick of it, Emerick got sick of it, and I'm sure the Beatles themselves, though the cause of it, were REALLY sick of it.   <br /> <br />So the relief of NOT having to deal with that is evident in the grooves(pits, bitstream?) of this album.  And frankly, that is what makes it a charming album that I continue to occasionally revisit.  It certainly is an album of peaks and valleys, and I admit to not making it through the last \\"song\\" (Kreen-Akore) all the time, but it still has a magic and sense of liberation that makes it a fun listen.  It is its own thing, not to be compared to any Beatles album or even any \\"proper\\" McCartney album.  It's not a proper album in that sense.  Not one single was culled from it, and its simple, homespun nature was even part of its promotion.  The artist had no grandiose ambitions, really nothing to say.  He was celebrating his musical freedom more than his artistic freedom.  I don't think his artistic freedom was challenged with the Beatles, but it had reached the point where it became such a hassle to turn up and go through it that it was a great relief to bring down the curtain.   <br /> <br />This album, really, and somewhat sadly, celebrates Macca's liberation from the Beatles' straightjacket.  Profound it ain't and purposely so, I imagine.  He certainly wasn't looking for that type of pressure at that particular time.  There would be time for the inevitible comparisions later.  For now, just this humble little homemade work. <br /> <br />As such, it works.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great Movie! If you haven't bought the first season of Firefly, then make sure you watch that as well.  One of the better movies I have watched in the last couple years.
B000J10EQU|5.0|This is a great, modern approach to the Superman mythos, and quite enjoyable and satisfying. The plot twists and turns are quite well-done, and Bryan Singer knows how to direct a superhero movie, as evidenced by the original \\"X-Men\\" and \\"X-Men 2\\", but he goes beyond that; he gives us characters we can care about and sympathize with. Having Lois engaged to another man after Superman has been gone five years is a wonderful twist to the plot, and even more so her having a son (which I think everyone can figure out the child's parentage by the end of the movie). Brandon Routh is a worthy successor to the late Christopher Reeve, as is Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane a worthy successor to Margot Kidder. Frank Langella is terrific as Perry White, and James Marsden (Cyclops from the \\"X-Men\\" movies). The young actor who played young Jason, Lois' son, was great too. Kevin Spacey, while not as good a Lex Luthor as Gene Hackman, is much more ruthless and cold-hearted and deliciously insane. All in all, this is a great movie, one worthy of purchasing and watching.
B0000646UN|5.0|One of the greatest, and most accurate war films made, yet little known by most English-speaking viewers. An army reserve unit is mobilized to man the fortified Mannerhiem Line, in the early days of World War II. The characters express all the usual concerns about the coming ordeal...and then it happens. The Soviet Union launches a massive armored onslaught against Finland. Despite Finland's lack of manpower, equipment, and supplies, they devasted wave after wave of Russian assaults. Finland had better-trained soldiers, repelling hundreds of thousands of expendable communist conscripts. In the years before, wisely foreseeing the inevitable conflict with the communist power to the east, Finland had a series of fortifications built in advance, and the Finns utilized these to maximum effect! This film portrays the frontline combat very well, but the entire war had various fascinating perspectives that should also be portrayed on film some day. To get a greater idea of the conflict, read the book, \\"A Frozen Hell\\" (which I have also reviewed).
B000FTWB7G|3.0|When I first listened to this album, I thought the first track was pretty strong and had high hopes for the rest.  I also really liked the single, Call Me When You're Sober, but as a whole, the rest of the album just failed to grab me.  There were plenty of Ok songs, but not many that were above average.  I think Fallen was a significantly stronger album musically and was fairly disappointed by this effort from Evanescence.
B000I0QLZU|5.0|I owned the standard Definition version of this, so I was really psyched to see the High Def version! After viewing this in Blu-Ray, I gave my old version away to a family member who hasn't made the leap yet to HD Video!<br /><br />I won't go into the movie plot, you can read the synopsis in this ad if you want that, instead, I will say the Blu-Ray transfer is great, not the best I've seen in Blu-Ray, but pretty darn good! Sharp scenes! Vibrant colors, and a film-like quality that sucks you right in! If you made the smart move to Blu-Ray already, then be even smarter and add this terrific action flick to your library!
B000G759LW|5.0|The first disc is the stronger of the two. But they both have great songs to offer.  <br />Everybody probably has heard \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" but the first disc has something that could attract a variety of listeners. My personal favorites are \\"Back in the Day\\" and \\"Understand\\" (I love this song. I have a feeling this could work as a single.). The first disc sounds very contemporary while the second disc uses more of past sounds like \\"Candyman\\" (1940's band) and \\"I Got Trouble\\" (1920-30's blues). My favorite song on the album is \\"Hurt\\". Usually songs that seem bombastic and operatic sound overdone (like Meatloaf songs or Celine Dion recordings) but I thought Christina's voice made this song seem heartfelt to me and not overwrought. The production on this album is fantastic, especially the first disc. Some tracks are dull (primarily on the second disc) but the positives definitely outnumber the negatives on the album. This is the best pop album of the year (IMO) so I definitely recommend it. <br />

0684803356|5.0|I'm a middle-aged middle-class guy. I read this recently, since it has a reputation as one of the great Amerian novels, and my particular HS required no Hemingway.  I figured the time had come. <br /> <br />So now, having read it, I think For Whom the Bell Tolls was an important milestone, something of a product of its times.  There was not yet such a body of anti-war or humanist literature as there is now...perhaps Hemingway played a role in creating that.  Still, it is not just an anti-war book; intelligent people have known a long time, as Sherman put it, that war is simply \\"brutality\\" that cannot be made pretty.  So this is not Hemingway's main point.  If anything, he even sounds pro-war in the brief sections that justify the Spanish Civil War and the fight against the Fascists.  (He seems a little blind to the pact the Spanish Republicans made with the devil, i.e. the Russian communists, but history had not yet proven the bloodthirstiness and corruption of the Soviet Union.) <br /> <br />Hemingway's main theme in this book is personal honor, and how personal concerns affect one's perceptions and may override original, idealistic motives.  The hero, American dynamiter Robert Jordan, has snuck behind Fascist lines to help destroy a bridge and aid a planned Republican frontal attack.  But three things happen - his guerilla teammates are led by a very disillusioned old veteran, who argues bitterly with his tough old wife; and Robert falls in love Maria, with a refugee they are sheltering, raped and nearly killed by the Fascists.  Finally, his spying reveals the front is losing the element of surprise.  In this dangerous situation, he wants to call it all off, and retreat to a life of happiness with Maria.  Sorry, no further plot will be revealed here.... <br /> <br />This way we get to study two different couples.  We learn that Pablo and Pilar, the guerillas, have killed many people, up-close and personal.  Pablo seems to have enjoyed it.  Pilar did less hands-onkilling but she and the others are still dedicated to the cause.  Now here comes an outsider, a handsome young American with no real dog in this fight, bringing the front closer just when Pablo has had enough.  Even worse, he falls for Maria, and sleeps with her in his own bag, outside the cave.  (The love scenes, though not very graphic, are pretty juicy for their time.)  Pilar tries to bolster Robert's resolve, even plotting against her husband.  Maria is lost without Robert, and will follow him anywhere.  But where will Robert end up going?  He has committed himself, and he wants to fulfill his duty as a matter of honor.  What destiny will bring the best honor for both himself and Maria?  Having sacrificed so much so far, what further sacrifice do any of these people need to maintain their honor? <br /> <br />Unlike many contemporary books, FWTBT does not have a big, overwhelming climax.  Instead, the ending unfolds in a way that you might have expected, as you read it.  This unfortunately left me a little cold, unable to decide whether I Love the Book, the way I do some others.  But it is an indispensable milestone.  Perhaps better read if you are not already so jaded or anti-war that you can't conceive of a cause worth fighting for.

B00005T30L|5.0|`Ghost World' is one of those movies that you'll enjoy much more if you can relate, which I can.  When I was in school I was the social outcast, the uncool kid who hated everyone around him because they were too normal.  It's just so funny to watch a movie like `Ghost World' and think about my own high-school days.  The entire cast, notably the two female stars Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson turn in brilliant performances as best friends whose lives change shortly after graduating high-school. <br /> <br />Thora stars as Enid, the social outcast who hates everyone and everything normal in her peers and finds her only sense of comfort in playing cruel pranks of those she feels unworthy.  Her latest prank includes Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a 40ish vintage record collector who is lonely and reclusive and is seeking female companionship through an add in the paper.  What Enid never expected is that she would develop a crush on this man who is \\"the opposite of everything I completely hate.\\"   <br /> <br />As Enid's relationship with Seymour develops her relationship with her best friend Becky (Scarlett Johansson) begins to suffer.  Her negativity to everything associated with Becky and their plans is starting to push them apart.  Becky is trying to establish a life apart from the dependency of her parents roof, getting a job, an apartment, but Enid and her uncertain and complete fickleness is driving a wedge into those plans. <br /> <br />Complete with that perfect deadpan sarcasm that laces almost every word, and the brilliant dry expression-ridden performances that only `accentuate the negative', `Ghost World' works on every level to deliver a brilliant comedy that is bound to please all who watch it.
B000IOM1RI|3.0|The answer to the above question is - sadly - no.  But since the D are in fact the greatest band on earth, I won't complain too much.  In short, this is not album I hoped for.  As a follow-up to their classic debut, this disc falls far short.  That's not to say it isn't worth picking up though.  It definitely rocks, and Jack's voice is as awesome as ever. <br /> <br />The frequent gripes about the short duration of most of the tracks (and the entire CD) are true.  But it is worth remembering that if you remove all the spoken-word bits from the first album, the total running time isn't that much longer.  Many of the tracks found here exist mainly to counterpoint the plot of the movie.   <br /> <br />This CD is not without it's moments.  The opening track, \\"Kickapoo,\\" must be recognized as a Tenacious D classic.  And even though \\"History\\" has been well known for years to devotees of the D, I am very glad to have a great rendition of it on an album.  \\"Beelzeboss (The Final Showdown)\\" is another great track - even if it loses a bit outside the context of the movie.   <br /> <br />Even the lesser tracks are growing on me as I listen to it more.  I think I had to get past the first few listens, in order to accept that it simply is not as great as their debut.  That album is such a supremely awesome piece of work; I hoped the D would follow it up with something equal.  I was pleased to see the album debut in Billboard's Top Ten - I hope that Jack and Kyle continue their reign and record more music.
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Okay, so this isn't the best cartoon to come out in recent years, and there were a few times where I asked myself when it would end, but for the most part I laughed at 'Chicken Little' and that's why you watch these things right, to laugh.  The fish and the pig make this movie, yeah and Joan Cusacks voice over which was just perfect.  All in all this may not be your top choice for family fun time, but it will serve as a nice break from the day.  Yesterday I was iced in from work with nothing to do but watch a bunch of movies and 'Chicken Little' was one of them.  It wasn't the worst way to pass my time, that's for sure. <br /> <br />I liked the concept of linking alien invasion to the fable of Chicken Little, but I found that I was more entertained BEFORE the aliens where introduced and soon after the invasion I found myself growing bored, but that was just me.  The father/son moments where a bit overdramatic and somewhat annoying and they felt a little missplaced.  I will admit that the ending with the aliens and the 'big voice' was really funny and so at least it ended on a good note, somewhat making me forget I was getting bored.  And the movie doesn't drag out either, so once you start to lose interest have no fear, the credits is close at hand.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|This movie really gives a different view of Al Gore.  He's a smart guy who has a lot of passion around global warming.

Lots of great data explained well in this film.
B000GY729M|3.0|It must be profoundly difficult to create the followup to a big-selling first album. Give the people what they want or follow your artsitic vision? The former may lead to good sales, but even the most ardent fan will get tired of the \\"same old thing\\" eventually. The latter may be artistically satisfying, but will probably alienate your existing fan base. What to do? <br /> <br />It seems that The Killers have threaded the needle pretty well on their sophomore effort. Upon reading some pre-release reviews, I was convinced that the CD would sound like the love child of \\"Born To Run\\" and \\"A Night At the Opera\\". It's nothing of the kind. The scope is bigger and the influences are broader (and yes, the Boss is definitely in there), but fans of the band's first work should have no trouble finding something to enjoy here.  Sam's Town, When You Were Young and For Reasons Unknown are standout tracks. <br /> <br />That being said, I do find that, for me, it's not as compelling as \\"Hot Fuss\\". I played it fairly heavily for the first two weeks or so, but its time in my CD player has dropped off dramatically since then. This is not to say that it's not a good CD. It just doesn't match up with my personal tastes quite as well.  I figure I'll trot it out in a couple of weeks and give it another listen. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that current Killers fans should not be afraid to give this disk a spin. New fans (is there anyone left?) should probably start with \\"Hot Fuss\\".
B000J6H1SE|4.0|Narrated by the daughter of Ukrainian immigrants in England, this is the story of an 84 year old man and his marriage to a much younger woman from the Ukraine.  It emerges that, for the young woman and her son, this is a marriage of convenience to secure their entry into the UK.  When she learns that the elderly man has limited funds, she engages in physical and emotional abuse of her husband.  The husband's daughter narrates her involvement in securing her father's divorce from this refugee, as well as the history of her parent's immigration and their hardships in the Ukraine.  She outlines her father's obsession with engineering and his short history of tractors which he is composing in Ukrainian.  The story of the marriage is confusing and sad; the story of immigration and hardship in the Ukraine is horrifying and sad.  The daughter's dilemma is heartfelt and sad.  What a weighty reading experience it is.     So, what's with the marketing of this book (the edition I read is published in the UK)?  The cover announces a book that is \\"extremely funny\\" and \\"mad and hilarious.\\"  There is hardly a moment of levity let alone hilarity on these pages.     I finally laughed out loud on p. 219 when the daughter describes the task of housetraining six cats \\"like something out of Russia in the 1930s.\\"   This was the only laugh in a book heralded as \\"uproariously funny.\\"  I assume the reader is meant to be amused by Valentina's bad use of English, but she is such a formidable, belligerent and stormy personality that her misuse of language comes over as another tactic to abuse everyone around her, especially her aged husband.    Nevertheless, this story is often touching and thought-provoking.  In addition to the tale of her mother's painful immigration, the daughter's dilemma in coping with her father's delusion and caprices is genuine and moving, as is her newfound understanding of her more dramatic and wounded sister.

B000JJRIP2|2.0|I've been a HUGE Kiss fan for 30 years, even through the 80's and some of their less popular stuff.  I've been tolerant with repeated re-releases and re-issues of the same stuff.  Everyone knows Gene and Paul are in it to make money.  I know that.  I still buy it, though.  But this release was a tremendous let down for me.  First, I've got the first 3 LIVE! records.  Who doesn't have the 1st!???  Classic.  Period.  II and III are mediocre at best.  Paul sings backup to his OWN vocals on II!  Pretty funny, when you think about it.  I know they've overdubbed to death, too.  But what live band doesn't do that?    Now...on to MILLINEUM.  Tired.  I can't believe the SLOW SPEED of almost every song.  And that's because of one thing....Peter.  I can't believe how unbelievably SLOW and boring his playing is. I'm a drummer, and his playing has gotten so pedestrian and UNexciting.  Check out Let me Go, Firehouse, Do You Love Me....and try not to fall asleep. Compare Alive! with MILLENEUM.  Incredible difference.  These songs have been done to death so many, many times in different packaging.  I'm really sorry that I spent money on it.  MILLINEUM was probably the worst concert they've ever released.  I just saw the STONES a month ago, and Charlie Watts is 5 years older than Peter and rocked!!  Eric Singer opened the Stones show with Alice Cooper and he was fantastic!  If KISS continues to rehash the same old stuff....put Eric back in.  Get Ace if you can, otherwise Tommy is awesome.  As for Gene and Paul, please release more vintage concerts and keep the new stuff to yourself. I did LOVE Kissology, though.     Does anybody agree with me?
B000I5X80G|3.0|The musical interplay between Young and Danny Whitten is awesome.  As someone else noted, \\"Cinammon Girl\\" was part of this set and has been omitted.  Also, the entire acoustic set is gone.

B000FTWB7G|4.0|Will the band be the same after the departure of co-founder Ben Moody?  Can Evanescence avoid the sophomore slump and put out a first-rate second album?  Does the band have the ability to join the ranks of Europe's top goth and goth-influenced bands such as Nightwish and Within Temptation?<br /><br />In a word, no.<br /><br />But if take this new album on its own terms, it's a credible effort.  The songs generally establish good atmosphere and mood, have a driving guitar in there somewhere, and show off Amy Lee's voice in one way or another.<br /><br />The main problem is a lack of musical variety.  There's a narrow range of chord progressions and a tendency to rely on the same set of intervals.  You can even sing the chorus from \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" throughout the next two tracks (\\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" and \\"Weight of the World\\") and it works.  That's not a good thing.<br /><br />The next four tracks (\\"Lithium,\\" \\"Cloud Nine,\\" \\"Snow White Queen,\\" and \\"Lachrymosa\\") strike a different tone than the first three.  No one of these songs has enough ideas by itself, so each ends up being repetitive by the end.  However, they would actually work nicely as a 12-15 minute suite with some further development and transitions.<br /><br />A secondary issue with this album is that Lee has pitched the vocal parts substantially lower than those in \\"Fallen.\\"  There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but it sacrifices the interplay between her sweet soprano and the heavier metal sounds of their successful first album.  I'm not sure that she gains anything in exchange for this decision, and it tends to make the band's sound more ordinary.<br /><br />If not for the band's remarkable success with \\"Fallen,\\" I'd review this as a promising debut album.  Compared to \\"Fallen,\\" it's a disappointment.  Is the glass half-empty or half-full?  Depends on your personality.  In a goth-influenced album that depends heavily on minor keys, I guess we should vote for half-empty.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|Like many \\"Superman\\" fans, I eagarly antisipated this version, & like the last reviewer, it is quite a disappointment, In my review a few years back, I stated that Warner Bros. should have allowed Donner to finish \\"Superman II\\", however, after seeing it, it is clear why they didn't, his version feels incomplete, coming from the director of the 1st \\"Superman\\" & the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" films, I expected more, this \\"Superman II\\" just doesn't have the emotional impact as the original version, for starters, the opening picks up right where Superman is dispatching Luther's California bound missle into space from the 1st film, this missle's detonation now frees the three villians from the Phantom Zone,  the Paris Tower scene is gone, this didn't bother me at first, but Superman tossing the hydrogen bomb stuck in an elevator into space & accidently freeing the three villians with its nuclear exposion is more beliveable, seeing that \\"II\\" takes place at some later time than part 1, also, the hotel room scene at Niagra Falls is now gone, which was always a nice shot, it looked like a honeymoon suite, now we are given just a plain looking hotel room with no distinguishing features, although we get Margot Kidder in just a towel, & she is much more prettier is this scene, it just doesn't work like Lester's version, the Clark Kent/Superman revelation, sadly is not as emotional in Donner's version, as it is in Lester's version, also missing is the villian's comical assault on some redneck locals in the small town, suddenly the news crew appears, with no clear explanation, In Lester's version, you know why they are there, the villian's alteration of Mt. Rushmore is also gone, but the real disappointment is when Superman gives up his powers, In Donner's version, him & Lois have made love beforehand, like the last reviewer said, this makes no sense, Lester's version is better & more plausible, given that he wanted to experience mortal feelings, & had to give up his powers to do so, it also adds weight to the new film, In Donner's version, when Kent realizes his mistake, & returns to the fortress, Jor-El appears & gives him his powers back, which is hard to believe given the destruction of the crystals, In Lester's version, the green crystal appears simply because Superman never put it back after showing it to Lois, this was a stroke of luck no doubt & was more beliveable, & Donner's version has Superman rewinding time once again, which makes all the events of \\"II\\" seem as if they never happened, In \\"1\\", he did it to change Lois' inpending doom, which one could overlook, but what reason does he do it here is a mystery, there is no rational explanation, Lester's version is better, with that so-called forgetful kiss, which according to the new film, didn't work, overall the Original Lester version is much better, & edited much more better, Donner's cut has some of the worst editing ever, which is sad, it feels like an incomplete film compared to Lester's original film.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Amazing and creative--St Elsewhere is a genre bending masterpiece up there with OK Computer and Deloused in the Cremitorium.  Yes, Crazy is overplayed, but it is the next to worst song on the album--so creative and groovy; it is a must own for anyone that enjoys non genre specific, creative and unique music. <br /> <br />A+
B000IJ79WU|4.0|And trust me, I've waited long enough for this film to come out, ever since I heard rumors of it about six years ago.  As a kid, I thought Superman 2 was the greatest thing ever, but as I got older (about 15)and started evaluating movies, I noticed flaws and plot-holes and various other mistakes that make the film diminish in my eyes.  I realized then that it was not the same director.  That was when I started to pay attention to the people behind the camera, and realizing they were the ones who made the movies good or lame, not the actors.  I began to read about why this was so and found out Richard Donner had been fired, (they were filming Superman 1 and 2 at the same time) and most of his footage was reshot.  And Donner had gotten about 70% done by that time!  It blew my mind.  They were almost done!  And not only that, Lester used some of that footage! Finally, Donner was given permission to finish his version as closely as he could. <br />And now for the film itself.  Donner for obvious reasons to complete the story had to use some of Lester's footage (the fight sequence, the Niagra Falls scence, and little minor elements here and there) and even some test footage to complete one other scene.  All this because Donner never shot those things.  But the rest of the movie was still his.  And even when it's not his, the editing makes the pacing seem like he did shoot it.  The addition of the Marlon Brando footage adds so much more depth to the story that it seems to complete the Superman 1 and 2 they were striving for.  Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor is in for even more of the film, and not portrayed by a double like in the other version.  The action is much tighter and not filled with the slapstick humor Lester uses.  And the villians are much more cruel in Donner's cut.  But through it all the movie seems incomplete because there were also alot of elements that neither Donner nor Lester shot for the film, and so the film finishes at under 2 hours, even though you feelthat it could have gone on for at least a half hour more.  But all in all, you get a sense at how Superman 2 would have been a classic like the original, and part of a story arch, rather than a sequel.
B000ILYYJE|1.0|once again the band/record company passes off a Doors product and calls it \\"complete\\".  <br /> <br />where are the two excellent post-Morrison studio albums \\"Other Voices\\" and \\"Full Circle\\"? why oh why are these always ignored? maybe they didnt sell well in 71-72 but that doesnt mean they dont deserve to see the light of day. you have to go on ebay and buy a russian import to get them on cd.  <br /> <br />dont get me wrong, the doors are a six star rated band out of five ... the greatest american rock group of all time. but they deserve, and us dedicated fans, deserve better. <br /> <br />\\"we want the world and we want it....NOW\\"
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Loreena McKennitt has been a favorite of mine for quite some time.  It's hard to review a CD after only a couple of listenings but my impression is: <br /> <br />Very similar in style to \\"The Mask and the Mirror\\" and some songs from \\"Book of Secrets\\".  This isn't a bad thing.  Two of my favorite songs of McKennitt's are \\"Dante's Prayer\\" and \\"The Mystic's Dream\\" and almost every song on this CD feels similar to those two songs.  The problem, if you can consider it one, is that there's less variety.  Each individual song on its own would be a standout on most of her other CDs.  Together, they blend and only once in awhile do I feel compelled to truly pay attention to one of the songs when it's playing.  Probably the solution for me will be to make a mix of her CDs or my other music, so that each song can have a bit of a spotlight when it comes up. <br /> <br />For those who haven't been exposed to McKennitt, this may be the 'safest' entry to start with.  Her voice is wonderful, perhaps one of the clearest and most haunting voices I've heard from a female singer.  The music mostly exists to frame her voice, but it's lovely in its own right, if sometimes repetitive. <br /> <br />For those who enjoy McKennitt's other CDs, there's very little of her 'old' Celtic style (no harps, no feet thumping songs like her live version of \\"The Old Ways\\"), but if you like the sound of her past two CDs you'll probably consider this album like you would an old friend who hasn't changed much.  It's comfortable, still the same as you remembered... and that's not always a bad thing.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|Well, I finally listened to it, and I absolutely hated it. The whole thing seems pointless. Who is this recording supposed to be for? Who is responsible for this? The Beatles? Well, half of them are dead. Who stands to profit from this? Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono of course, and since the name MARTIN is almost as big as the word BEATLES in all the ads, I assume the Martin family has decided to cash in. Fine, they all worked hard 40 years ago, everybody enjoys Beatles music, I don't mind throwing them a bone. Wait, Giles Martin? Who is that? Ah, George Martin's son. Maybe George Martin went deaf, then Giles Martin took his daddy's tapes and went hog-wild with them on a computer. Because this sounds like something I could piece together in my living room with my Beatles cd's and some fancy software. And this is apparently a souvenir to a Las Vegas show. And you can tell, because they've managed to make the Beatles sound artificial and stupid. The connection between this and what the Beatles were about is tenuous at best. This is a cash-in, pure and simple. And while the Beatles certainly never left a check uncashed, they were not completely dedicated to chasing The Almighty Dollar. What is the purpose of this cd? Is this intended for little children with no attention span? Boomers with deep wallets who want something to irritate their grandchildren with? Were the lyrics to Glass Onion so bad that only two or three lines from the song need to be heard anymore? I'm so glad I didn't pay for this. I say buy any one of the original albums instead of this dirty greedy artless business.<br /><br />This post has been edited by mittensonfire: Today, 11:12 AM
B000JBXXZ4|2.0|First I am a huge fan, saw Incubus a few times in concert, have every CD/DVD and a bunch of live boot legs. Folks, this record is bad..real bad. What happened to Incubus?? Where's Kilmore? Where's Brandon's surf rock voice? The main problem is the overall structure of the songs is \\"CHORUS-LESS\\". You guys will go back to listening to their old records. This will be their worst selling record. Take that to the bank! Trust me, listen before you buy..I didn't think Incubus could make such a bad record. Every band goes through this. Incubus will be back....we can only hope.
B00005TPKD|5.0|Everything that needs to be said about this Wonderfull CD, has been said here, so I'll give you a little history of the band  <br />Amon Dull 2.  In the middle to late sixties, an anarchistic, multi media commune formed in Germany, under the name of Amon Duul. Amon, is the Egyption sun god, and Duul, was the name of a fictional charactor from a book ( I don't know the name of The book, or the signifacants the charactor had for the commune members). The commune did some recordings under the name, Amon Duul. There were some members of the commune who had some musical training and they wanted to do some recordings that people would acctualy buy, seeing this as a good way to get their message out.  So the artistic element of the commune split into Amon Duul, and Amon Duul 2. The commune eventualy disbanded ( I don't know when), Amon Duul continued as a band, with many personeel, changes over the years.  Amon Duul did release some recordings in the early 70's, however I have never heard them.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Global warming a is hoax perpetrated by the UN and these nutty left wingers like Al Gore and George Soros. They all have a \\"One World Socialist Government\\" agenda on their mind. Their goal is to use this issue as a reason to establish a \\"Global Constitution\\". They also want Global taxes and to take away the \\"right to bear arms\\" in the USA. Why are they so anxious to take away the guns of law abiding citizens? YOU TELL ME......
B000HIVO64|4.0|Part of the fun of discovering a new Beck album is trying to identify from song to song where he's drawing his influence from, whether he happens to be drawing from his own previous songs or from those of others.    I wanted to let this CD sink in before throwing in my 2 cents, since each of his records, and this one in particular, take some time to digest and absorb.  Beck himself said on KCRW recently that this album began during the recording of \\"Mutations\\".  Personally, having collected all of Beck's releases along with a respectable collection of bootlegs, Mutations still stands as his most consistent.    Influences from that record abound on \\"The Information\\", but there are also songs that clearly originated during the Sea Change sessions and other parts of his career.    Some reviewers like to compare this song or that to Beck's \\"early period\\" or his \\"later period\\".  The truth is that he's been playing some songs live since the \\"early days\\". Next thing you know, they'll show up many years later during so called \\"later periods\\".  I suppose my point is that he's actually been remarkably consistent ever since he hit the scene some 13 years ago, which is not to say he hasn't matured; at the ripe old age of 35 or so, he commands the stage presence of musicians who have been at it for decades longer than him.     The persistent thread that runs through Beck's music (and other art for that matter) since the beginning has been his affinity for psychedelia.  I don't know much about scientology, but I always got the impression they're against the use of drugs of any kind.  Maybe this rule doesn't apply to recreational drugs, or maybe Beck has gotten special dispensation in that regard, because just about all of his albums sound like there was some pretty heavy recreational drug use going on during the recording sessions.    If you should have any doubt about what I'm talking about and you haven't had the fortune of seeing Beck live yet, when and if you do, once the show gets under way, you'll notice a pungent smell wafting through the venue.  I'm not sure what that smell was, but I noticed that same smell at Grateful Dead concerts as well.    I could do without the hip hoppy material and some of the kraut rock stuff, but on balance, this is another kick a$$ album from Mr. Hansen, and he does his best Stones/Jagger tribute yet on \\"Strange apparition\\".  That song alone is worth the price of admission.  \\"Soldier Jane\\" and \\"Dark Star\\" (a nod to the aforementioned Grateful Dead?) are just icing on the cake.    While this is indisputably a trippy record, it's also very accessible.  Can't wait to hear/see what this psychedelic horseman comes up with next as he rides on through the purple haze.
B00005221M|1.0|After hyping this movie up to friend, calling it - \\"one of the best movies ever made\\" - I was in horror as we viewed the DVD version of this film. (At this point - the \\"Expanded Edition\\" is the only version available on DVD.)  The \\"expanded\\" enhancements only detered from the perfect balance of character definition, emotional struggles, and white- knuckle action of the original.  As much as I loved the original (and BECAUSE of how highly I regarded the original), I would not recommend the DVD to anyone.  I only hope that someday someone will fund the re-release of this DVD in its original format.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Who is this truth inconvenient for?<br /><br />It's inconvenient for ExxonMobil.  It's inconvenient for the Bush White House.  It's inconvenient for the evangelicals who think that the rapture is only a few years away--so who cares if the planet turns into a humid swamp a few years down the road?  They and their toupees and their Jerry Falwell posters will be going to heaven--so, so, sorry, non-believers!<br /><br />I really didn't expect a lot from this production.  I've read at least my share of books on global warming.  So I didn't expect anything new.  Yet there was something new.  The fact that the soil loses moisture to the atmosphere as the temperature rises, the fact that sea ice breaking off can accelerate the breaking off of land ice, the fact that typhoons in the Southern Hemisphere have hit record levels--these facts and a few more I didn't know until I viewed this video.  But even more significant was the lucid clarity of the presentation.  Instead of writing a book for the few, Gore made a video for the many.<br /><br />You don't want to miss this.  Here is a guy who could be president of the United States.  Here is a guy that arguably got cheated out of the presidency.  Here is a guy who is light years ahead of the present occupant of the White House in almost everything that we consider noble in humanity.  And what does he do after losing a microscopically close race that maybe he really didn't lose?  He recognizes the greatest problem facing humanity; educates himself to an outstanding degree on the subject, and then puts together a program for informing as many citizens as possible about the grave danger facing this planet.  This production is the result of all his work.<br /><br />All I can say is, Gore for President in 2008!<br /><br />Would that it were possible.  The special interests and the head-in-the-sand couch potatoes will find some way to ridicule him; and the corporations against the truth about global warning will pour massive bucks into making sure that he is not one of the candidates in 2008.<br /><br />One of the other things that I thought about while watching this outstanding video, this PowerPoint presentation deluxe, this slide show for the century, this beautifully presented visual argument for action now before it is too late--is how amazing it is that the people who control the media, who make sure that, as Gore points out, the truth of global warming is thought to be scientifically \\"controversial,\\" when in fact there is no scientific controversy at all, only a commercial media controversy--how amazing it is, I thought, that despite all the mass media control, the message is getting out.  This video is being seen by millions of people.<br /><br />Be sure you see it.  The worst case scenario for global warming is worse than almost any other imaginable disaster.  Terrorism, even nuclear warfare, pales in comparison to the earth in a runaway greenhouse catastrophe.  Imagine Venus with the surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.  Global warming could lead to a sterilization of the planet.<br /><br />And THAT is why Gore has devoted himself to warning us.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a smart, sharp and very moving visual presentation, brilliantly directed by Davis Guggenheim, a presentation that I hope reaches an enormous audience, who will in turn assert themselves toward saving the planet before it is too late.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|I can understand all people that have gotten dissapointed with this new album. Although it may have a familiar sound, reminiscence of previous albums, i have found this one a very special one. I cannot put my finger on it and say why, but i should say is even better than Book of Secrets.  <br />I'm not one that listens to her music everyweek or not even once a month, but she is still one of my favorites musicians and i cherish to have most of her cd's in my wide collection. Maybe that's the main reason i don't find it so repetitive, or more of the same.....but the most important thing: i enjoy it very much and love it!    <br />I got it yesterday and i'm already captivated but the soaring tempo, voice and instrumentation in the songs. The more i listen to it, the more i like it. Guys, give yourself some time. Listen to it, find the special moment, that special mood. <br />Highly recommended. You don't find music of this nature out there so easily: heavenly voice, real instruments, magnificent lyrics, beautiful arrangements. <br />Happy Holidays to everybody, we' got the gift of her music back!! Let's celebrate it!

B000JJS8TM|4.0|When I first heard about this project, I was very excited. I am a huge Beatles fan, and have seen several live productions by Cirque Du Soleil. For me however, There are only 3 standout tracks: \\"Drive My Car/Word/What You're Doing\\", \\"Within You without You/Tomorrow Never Knows\\", and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".Yes the DVD audio is great, but I was hoping for at least some video, even stills from the show. It seems redundant to package both discs together.<br /><br />Still, I'll give it 4 stars, because 40 years later this music is better than almost anything being done today.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|This album is a little different from STS but still has enough of the riffs, vocals, and attitude that it's entertaining.   My biggest complaint with December is that it's so short. No hidden track?  What's the deal AFI?    Seems like it's over about the time I'm really getting into it.  There are couple of hard rockers, Kill Caustic for example, but it's a little mellower (is that a word?) than what I would prefer.  AFI is still the best band out there, despite what I consider a little bit of a letdown from Sing the Sorrow.

0486650677|5.0|From organization, to prose, to content, to price, this is the best book on the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulation of Classical Mechanics.  I just wish this book treated more subjects!  The numbered list organization with pithy summaries really works for me.  The thought provoking and mathematically fluent prose style is a joy to experience.  The author is clearly a master of Einsteinian Relativity, Classical Physics, Differential Geometry, and functional analysis.  In fact I seem to recall him writing some other books along those lines.  Lanczos is a real treat to read.  I have read parts of over a dozen different books on Intermediate/Advanced Classical Mechanics and  Lanczos is just superb.  As a standalone text, it may not be the best choice, but when accompanied by Arya or Hand and Finch it is very enriching.  Fluent and cohesive are the words that come to mind when describing this work.  This book is especially good for someone who knows a good deal of math and would like to be introduced to classical mathematical physics.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Lanczos's masterpiece!
B000J4QWMC|4.0|I saw this film in the theater b/c I was intrigued, and I found it dense, immersive and compelling. <br /> <br />The second time, aspects of directorial and acting genius emerged. <br /> <br />Great, great film.  Most don't get it?  Fine; most think that PEter Jackson's bastardization of Tolkien was a representation of the Lord fo the Rings because there were cool special effects. <br /> <br />What makes a film is not effects, as Miami Vice demonstrates; what makes a film is characterization, and well-drawn plot. <br /> <br />This film is dense with all of that.  You'd have to wake up out of your consumerist coma to know it.
B000IU3Y1O|5.0|this is a career-spanning greatest hits album right up to the newest album \\"playing the angel\\".  i already own the compilations the singles 81-85 and 86-98, but they do not cover the highlights after that.  I think this is a very fitting addition to my collection, with most of their best stuff right here on one disc.  Volume two should be excellent, and a completion of what couldnt be squeezed onto this disc.<br /><br />Additionally the dvd with this is great, a lot of the videos with a few omissions, like \\"home\\" and \\"see you\\", but hey, there always has to be stuff for volume two.  Well worth the investment, and I picked this up for a steal...so buy it now, you will not be dissapointed.
0812550706|5.0|For all those parents who have children that feel are different and picked on, this is the book for them to read.  It will make them feel as part of the character in the book and no obstacles could stand in their way. <br /> <br />The story is great and caught me by surprise.  I'm a huge fan of strategy and tactical games and such and this was enjoyable to read.  Whenever Ender was presented with a challenged, I was always interested in reading the outcome and how he solved it.
B000000WZ4|5.0|This is one of the top four albums of all time by depeche mode with violator, excitor, and songs of faith and devotion being very near or with it in equivelence. I was hooked by the tracks it's no good and barrel of a gun prior to buying this album, and then tracks like home and useless sink this album into the depths of you brain where you can't get the songs out.  A must have, first purchase for any beginning depeche mode fan.
0553804677|5.0|The world created is very immersive.  There has been a lot of thought and detail in creating this world.  The writing is very good and detailed.  The characters created are very rich and convincing.   <br /> <br />The book is a lot about the world of thieves and especially one called Locke Lamora.  I was very interested in reading how he reaches his goals with his various cons and tricks.   <br /> <br />The one thing I did not like too much about the book was the late introduction of the antagonist and how he explained his reasons for him being there.  For the longest time I felt I knew who it was but to find out I was way off and that he came totally out of the blue. <br /> <br />This is still a great read and would recommend it to anyone.
0375713751|2.0|I just finished this book, and I have to say it is a load of crap.  As a  working mother of 3, I actually found it offensive.  Kate Reddy's entire life is out of control due to 1 thing...Kate Reddy.  Why is it OK for Richard, described repeatedly as slow Richard, due to the fact his business is not going well, not expected to do more?  When Kate asks him to help tidy up b/c friends are coming over, he says he \\"just finished alphebitizing the CD's\\".  This seems to be typical of his behavior throughout the book.  Why isn't he the one walking aroung with a mental list in his head?  Why can't he call the carpet people for a quote? <br />  This book was represents everything that's wrong with our society and the way we view families and parenthood.  It basically says that women are responsible for everything, and we can't hack it.  I'm going to give away the ending here but...why doesn't Richard give up his job?  He's not the primary breadwinner, as Kate tells his parents.  Is this 1952?  If he were home, they could get rid of the Paula problem, cleaner problem, etc.  But that is never even considered here.  Kate nobly gives it all up for her family, which I'm sure appeals to some, but I guess I found it cliche.  Why are women still expected to carry  all the burdens while men get to walk around happy and clueless? <br />  A quote \\"I've never seen a seminar for balancing work and fatherhood\\"
0380789035|2.0|I found this story to be quite boring for a while.  To sum it up, I didn't really get interested until about the 500th page and then it was over 50 pages later, along with a drawn out resolution to cover all the other loose ends from all the other subplots, which I didn't really care about by then.<br /><br />The writing was good.  I just needed something more to keep me interested and after the first couple hundred pages I felt I was reading only to just get the book over with so I can start on another book.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|All facets of a presentation constituting this highly informative doco fit perfectly a professional politician's statesman expertise gained at the top positions while working for the superpower the USA are.<br /><br />However, picturesquely depicting the real threats to accustomed natural environment on this planet seemed subtly avoiding a question of the gradual ageing of the Earth itself.

B00005RY7X|5.0|This album is purely fun all the way through. I listened to it with my little sister once and she usually hates the music I listen to, but even she liked Andrew W.K. I lost my first copy of this album, but I went and bought it again because it is THAT good! Buy this album ASAP if you don't already own it. You won't regret it.
1400049628|3.0|After reading the sterling, glowing reviews tagging this book as the best thing going, I was mildly disappointed. The book is not terrible. But unless you're a fan of the survival guides which this book parodies, you may find it lacking. I am not a fan of survival guides. <br /> <br />
B000J103PC|5.0|I loved this movie. It was great seeing Anne Hathaway in a grown-up role. Meryl Streep does an excellent job as the boss from hell. Hathaway plays Andy a young woman who sees working for Runway as a step up to other \\"serious\\" journalism jobs. But in the process for working for Miranda she starts becoming another person, one that she doesn't like very much, and she must then make the choice of which path to follow. The Devil Wears Prada is hilarious, sexy, and funny.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|It's not a unique story among movie studios. A director is hired to direct a film, he has some sort of creative differences with some higher-ups in the studio, the producers decide to fire the director or he decides to quit before shooting is done. A high percentage of films actually start out this way (how many directors were attached to \\"Superman Returns\\" before it finally came out?). Richard Donner was well into filming the sequel to his hit movie Superman when the producers let him go and brought in another director to finish the film. The twist in this story is that Donner had been filming both the original and the sequel at the same time! While Peter Jackson may have him beat by filming all three \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films at once, Donner was a pioneer in his time.<br /><br /> Eventually Superman II saw the light of day with a new director. Some of Donner's footage was used, but most wasn't. While fans enjoyed the second Superman film (still considered by most the best of the four), there was always that question of just how Richard Donner would have done it given the chance. Now, over twenty-five years after its filming, we get to see it.<br /><br /> This is such an incredible situation for film buffs. Donner found every minute of the footage he'd shot, and brought it all together to show the film the way he had envisioned it. The result? An incredible new version of a beloved film.<br /><br /> When you hear a director had shot over seventy percent of a film, it sounds like a good bit...but you don't realize just how much that equals out to until you're watching it on screen. The vast majority of this film is stuff you've never seen before!<br /><br /> So what are the major differences? The beginning and end are two stark changes. A new explanation is given for how the criminals (General Zod, Ursa, and Nom) escaped the Phantom Zone, tying it directly into Superman's actions in the first film. It works beautifully. The relationship between Clark and Jor-El is explored further, and while there are a few rocky moments it seems to work. I definitely like it better than the relationship with Lara explored in the original version. All of the footage Marlon Brando shot was used, and there's one scene in particular that especially poignant. Don't want to ruin it, but you'll see what I mean if you watch it.<br /><br /> Since they still had to use parts of the film shot by the follow-up director, you can immediately tell the difference. Donner's Lois Lane seems to rely on natural beauty (no visible make-up), while the other scenes shot with her have her heavily made up. She goes from looking like someone Clark could fall in love with to a circus clown. Some scenes in the film were actually screen tests, lacking the perfect lighting and even correct hair styles (in one scene in particular Clark's hair changes styles with almost every cut), and a couple of scenes are obviously body doubles used for lighting checks. Still, you can see where those scenes are necessary and they add to the flow of the story.<br /><br /> The infamous final battle scene in the Fortress of Solitude is gone. No giant flying rubber Superman symbols, no holographic clones, and no statues come to life. Instead, it's a battle of wits between Superman and Zod. While the end result is the same (no surprises here, but Superman saves the day), it's interesting to see it happen.<br /><br /> But there are weak moments as well. The ending is vastly different, and while I'm glad to see the \\"magic amnesia kiss\\" gone, the new resolution doesn't fare much better. In Donner's defense, he'd filmed this ending before he was fired and had a different ending for the first Superman movie in mind. Still, it seems a little anticlimactic when it's all said and done.<br /><br /> About thirty minutes into the movie, scenes become choppy and you're jerked around between Lex's discovery of the Fortress of Solitude, Clark and Lois's visit to Niagara Falls, and Zod's domination of the planet. But if you can ride out the sudden shifts in scenery for a while, it evens out. There are a few deleted scenes included, as well as a short documentary on how they restored the original vision of the film.<br /><br /> The end result is a film I enjoyed much better than the original version. We can only imagine what Donner would have been able to do with the franchise if he'd been given the chance. But at least now we can forever lay to rest the rumors of what might have been with the second movie. If you were \\"underwhelmed\\" by Superman Returns, give this one a try.domination of the planet.

B000H305U0|5.0|Justin's sophomore album is even better than his first. Sexyback is my favorite from FutureSex/LoveSounds. He most certainly has grown since Justified and has come far from his NSYNC days. I can't wait to see what he comes out with in the future. FutureSex/LoveSounds is sexy and adult, its obvious that Justin is no longer an adolescent.
B0007W0MTA|4.0|Serious reggae listeners argue a lot about these Trojan albums, especially in regards to the sheer amount of times new label bosses Sanctuary release the same songs on different compilations -- but surely these are minor and relatively insignificant objections when one considers the value for money and the enduring quality of the music on these albums.  <br /> <br />(A possible objection to this otherwise comprehensive and worthy compilation is that \\"Six and Seven Books of Moses\\" and the Maytals Rasta/Rockers late 70's interpretation of \\"Bam Bam\\" are -- sadly-- excluded.)  <br /> <br />\\"When I Laugh\\" will be a minor revelation for Delta blues fans, with it's distinctly Robert Johnson blues vocal style and brass section reminiscent of The Dirty Dozen New Orleans octet.  <br /> <br />\\"My New Name\\" -- like \\"Six and Seven Books\\" -- has a Cajun abandon to the vocal and rhythm.  <br /> <br />The version of \\"Bam Bam\\" on CD 1 is the mid 60's cut, not the later confident, confessional Rasta meditation which appeared on the Island anthology. (It is worth noting that Chaka Demus and Pliers also released their own digital interpretation of this tune on the same backing track as \\"Murder She Wrote.\\")  <br /> <br />\\"Bim Today\\" has a thudding b line reminiscent of Junior Delgado's \\"Tichion.\\" \\"Scare Him\\" has a full speed and reckless Rockers rimshot snare pattern.  <br /> <br />Cd 2 moves -- from jazz influenced bluebeat and ska -- into Toot's distinctive soulful reggae incarnation .  <br /> <br />\\"It's You\\" on this 2nd cd gets the reggae treatment over a slower b line, contrasting with the earlier frantic ska interpretation. \\"Time Tough\\" is a stand out track here, with its fearful, yet stoic lyric about the struggle of life.  <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />
B0002W4SWC|5.0|Renee Zellweger plays Bridget well and does the character justice. I like that Bridget is an imperfect character and that's very refreshing to see. Bridget Jones's Diary is a rehash of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and its a very deliciously wicked take on the classic novel. Colin Firth plays a modern Mr. Darcy yet again and I like him better in this version. Its a cute, sexy movie and I highly recommend it.
B000ICLHIE|5.0|If Sam Cooke has the most beautiful singing voice of all time, Tom Waits has the grittiest.  In a strange way, this comparison is not out of the question.  I have always felt that it was impossible to accurately capture Cooke's voice and do it justice.  It transcends modern recording.  Wait's voice is the same way. You should earmark $100, buy this album, a Sam Cooke album, and donate the rest to a New Orleans charity.  It will make a difference in your life.
B0001L3LUE|3.0|Fog of War<br /><br />An interesting insight into a highly intelligent, articulate and fallible man.  Mr. McNamara discusses eleven crucial lessons that he has learned about the waging of war.  Present leaders would do well to take these lessons to heart.  Hindsight has enabled him to understand and articulate the mistakes that he and Johnson made with regard to Vietnam.  Many of these mistakes are eerily similar to the mistakes that the Bush administration has made and is making with regard to Iraq.<br /><br />I don't know anything about Mr. McNamara except from what I learned in this video.  Therefore, I suppose I had a fairly unbiased opinion of him before watching this.  After watching this, however, I come away with a feeling that he is a good man who got lost in the fog of war.  It is interesting to note that some of the first advice that he offered to Johnson was to get out of Vietnam before it spiraled out of control.  This is confirmed by an excerpt of a phone conversation that he had with President Johnson.<br /><br />I think that this video is slightly marred by the quirky editing.  I would have been much more pleased with a more extended and in depth discussion with Mr. McNamara instead of quick sound bites that are obviously cut and edited, I guess for \\"artistic effect,\\" but to me they detract from the seriousness of the subjects that McNamara is discussing.  It's almost as if the producers of this video didn't trust the attention span of the viewing public to simply listen to and learn from an in depth conversation and exploration of important events.<br /><br />The subject matter itself deserves five stars, but the handling of it in this video deserves only three in my humble opinion.  It's worth watching, but don't expect to be wowed by it or to gain a significantly deeper understanding of the events that it touches.

You see tonnes of visual jokes, a mass of verbal jokes and a lot of unbelievable good created stuff. <br /> <br />Fo me, the R Rating is not necessary, because there are no Action or Nudity scenes in this movie. In Germany it is rated 6 and up.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|So what's the story?<br /><br />This is a musical (or \\"rock opera\\" to use the correct technical term) set in New York City about a group of East Village young people caught up between their grasping landlord on the one hand, and poverty, illness and pre-combination therapy AIDS on the other. It's based on Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer and Tony Award winning musical, apparently one of the longest running shows on Broadway.<br /><br />Sounds all doom and gloom. Does it work as a musical?<br /><br />Rock opera, rock opera. And yes. This movie is all about celebrating life and all the possibilities it offers. It's about fighting for success and acceptance. The realities of illness and death are acknowledged but this is no mournful tale.<br /><br />But still. A rock opera? You?<br /><br />(Laugh) Yes, it's true I've never been one for musicals - or, shall we say, movies with singing and dancing in them. \\"The Sound of Music\\" and \\"Fame\\" are about all I can handle. I hated \\"Grease\\", I fell asleep ten minutes into \\"West Side Story\\", \\"Evita\\" went completely over my head and \\"Moulin Rouge\\" just gave me a headache. But I was determined to watch this one and I was determined to own a copy on DVD, primarily because of the issues it deals with. But there was also the fact that I'd heard the wonderful Jesse L. Martin was in it. I'm a huge fan and I'd only ever seen him on TV - first of all in that silly Ally McBeal's love interest and more recently as Detective Eddie Green on \\"Law & Order\\". The prospect of seeing him singing and dancing (which he does in this movie, and very well, it has to be said), to me was worth the price of the DVD all on its own. He was acting a gay character too, which only added to my excitement but there were no love scenes, sadly. There was kissing though...<br /><br />But, seriously and all superficial stuff aside, this is a great spectacle of drama, song and dance. Jesse L. Martin is not the only star here of course and he is supported (in my eyes anyway) by a great cast, including the ever-beautiful Rosario Dawson, ever-handsome (but always one dimensional) Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp and Tracie Thomas. Everyone gave great performances and you just HAVE to see the diner scene!<br /><br />But is it something that will stand up to repeated watching?<br /><br />I think so. For me anyway. On one of those days (which always come around) when I'm feeling low and need some life affirmation, I can think of no better DVD to put on. I'm glad I bought it.<br /><br />What about DVD Extras?<br /><br />Well, this 2-disc special edition has loads of extras, including commentary by director Chris Columbus and selected cast, a feature-length documentary called \\"No Day But Today\\", deleted scenes and musical performances and PSAs for Jonathan Larson's Performing Arts Foundation and the National Marfan Foundation.<br /><br />So well worth getting then?<br /><br />Absolutely. The only reason I didn't give it a five star recommendation is that I didn't really like that many of the songs. But for something to watch and get into, I think it's great.

0307277887|5.0|My first crime novel, and I picked a winner. This book was wonderful, I never knew a killer I could like more. I mean, Dexter is I think a rare charachter who we learn to enjoy his dark personality and it makes us struggle with our own morals. How would I feel about a KILLER of killers? With my own dark humor and personality, I loved how he drove himself to the edge and where it took him once he arrived in his revelation. I'll be reading Dearly Devoted Dexter, once I can pry it out of my wife's hands.
B000BZIST4|5.0|A fresh-faced Gene Hackman picked up one of this movie's five Oscars way back in 1971. As with music, this movie is evidence if any is needed, that good art doesn't grow old and this crime drama is one of the most influential movies of a decade that was choc-a-bloc with good American cinema.<br /><br />Hackman plays a ruthless and unscrupulous New York cop \\"Popeye\\" Doyle, who's out to bust a drugs ring operating between France and the United States. Doyle's partner Buddy Russo, is ably played by Roy Scheider and the chemistry between the gung-ho Doyle and the more circumspect Russo is something to see. Doyle was apparently based on a real-life detective, Eddie Egan, who, with his partner Sonny Grosso, seized $32 million worth of heroin in 1961. A record at the time.<br /><br />The language is colourful, as one would expect perhaps from a movie of that era, (not least when Doyle is squeezing the African American brothers for information) and there is violence. The movie is shot on location in New York City, Marseille and Washington D.C. and the urban landscapes gives that added realistic and gritty edge to the proceedings. We get to see the mundane and non-glamorous side of real police work.<br /><br />This is a classic cat and mouse chase between the good and bad guys and Fernando Rey plays the part of the smooth Frenchman Alain Charnier, perfectly. This is a five star classic crime caper, without a doubt. A genuine urban thriller.<br /><br />Loads of extras on this special edition DVD, including a documentary called \\"Making The Connection: The Untold Stories of The French Connection\\", deleted scenes, a featurette with director William Friedkin discussin the deleted scenes and still galleries.
B00005JPCA|1.0|I have always been a huge fan of the James Bond movies, and have all the DVDs in my collection.  This will be the first \\"James Bond\\" film that I will never own. If you're a traditional 007 fan like me you will hate it. <br /> <br />They have destroyed everything that made James Bond the popular movie hero that he was. Daniel Craig is James Bond with a license to bore.   Instead of the tall, dark, and handsome, suave and debonair naval officer who became a secret agent we have what appears to be a short blonde homely arrogant thug that would have been better cast as a villain's dumb bodyguard.   <br /> <br />Everything that made James Bond the popular movie hero is gone. Gone are the cool gadgets, the super villains, the charisma and charm, the clever one liners that convey character,the awesome music themes, the great seducer of all those Bond girls, the brilliant secret agent that had  <br />extensive knowledge on nearly everything, and who was always cool and unflappable in the face of danger.  That James Bond is dead. The James Bond films that were great fun escapism, are now replaced with a somber, depressing, brooding and dark version. <br /> <br />No Miss Moneypenny, no Q, the only person they kept is the one they should have gotten rid of, Judi Dench as that obnoxious feminist, M, who somehow must have traveled through time to go back to what is supposed to be Bond's first mission.  <br /> <br />Martini shaken, not stirred?  When a barman asks the new Bond whether he'll take his martini shaken or stirred, Craig snaps \\"Do I look like I give a da*n?\\"  Apparently the producers, Broccoli & Wilson, feel the same  <br />way, because they have killed the James Bond loved by millions and replaced him with what comes across as a classless, bumbling, sadistic psycho, who goes by the same name. <br /> <br />
0618164413|5.0|...but he was tooooo curious! <br /> <br />No other character in children's literature has, for me, more enduring appeal than this little monkey (with the possible exception of a certain Harold of purple crayon fame). I am currently in the process of buying a book a week for my baby niece...building her a library at least until the time she can actually read (though I doubt I will stop then!) In any event, my sister--her mom--was thrilled when I recently presented this small treasure as the latest addition to the ever-growing collection.  <br /> <br />Recommended with gusto--the only way you could possibly improve upon it is to buy each story in the collection separately, the sizes of which would be easier for kids to handle. But to have all the stories in one wonderful volume is just terrific, as well--especially if you're presenting it as a gift.
B000000OUJ|5.0|If there was any Wu-Tang member that could make a solid album between the 36 Chambers and Wu-Tang Forever era, it would be GZA. Every member of the Wu-Tang was talented and created in their own ways, but GZA knows how to make a phenomenal underground rap album. Unlike the majority of rap \\"stars\\" nowadays, GZA can craft excellent lyrics. The vintage kung fu sound clips also give it an extra step up. RZA did an excellent job in producing this album. With \\"Liquid Swords\\", GZA tells us how rap should be done: with meaningful lyrics, talent, distinctive vocal styles, and the soul of the Wu-Tang. A must own for the underground rap fan.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|Like many people here, I was practically salivating at the prospect of seeing this new vision of a beloved film.  But I have to say, the end result was very disappointing. Here are just a few of the problems I have with it (Spoilers ahead):<br /><br />(1) Many of the \\"new\\" scenes go on way too long.  The greatest offender is the stuff with Jor-El.  Maybe you think more Brando footage is like some kind of lost treasure, I don't know.  But I didn't learn anything new from the scenes, and I believe Brando just walked through the performance, with the promise of a big paycheck.<br /><br />(2) I think Lois's Niagra Falls test of her \\"Clark is Superman\\" theory is much more effective than Donner's scene.  It's practically the first scene in the movie.  Lois draws glasses on a picture of Clark, then figures she has enough evidence to throw herself out a window!  Huh?<br /><br />(3) The finale...it's almost too painful to talk about.  There is simply NO justification for repeating the SAME solution (spinning the world backwards) from the first film.  In the first film, he turned back time just far enough to save the woman he loved.  In Donner's cut of Superman II, he erases the events of the ENTIRE MOVIE.  I almost expected Clark to wake up in his bed in Smallville.  Heck, why not go even FURTHER back and bring his Dad back to life?  It's lazy writing, and it cheapens the character.<br /><br />Now, believe it or not, I'm a huge fan of the Christopher Reeve films.  And the one saving grace of this new cut is that we do get many restored scenes that don't appear in the theatrical version.  And this alone might be enough to justify the purchase for hardcore fans.  But for most everyone else, it's nothing more than a high-profile experiment.
B000E97Y6A|5.0|King Kong (Universal, 2005) opens with a stark reminder that we are not so far removed from the blight of a global depression, which is as close to us, today, as the precarious slip of a capital economy. Prescient images of shapeless shanties, relentless poverty, and quiet desperation in America's First City, which suffused the \\"civilized\\" world, still captivate us nearly four score years later. <br /> <br />The film transports everyone--viewers, protagonists, and antagonists alike--to and from two insidious jungles, presumably by way of the Bermuda triangle (how else can one depart from the Northeast Atlantic, arrive in the Southwest Pacific, and then return to homeport in so short a span of time?) Man's jungle is a bleak labyrinth of concrete canyons framed by elevated trains, aimlessly clacking their way along rickety iron rails through a sooty city overpopulated with treacherous opportunists and callous moviemakers. They prey on the masses, numbed by appalling unemployment and deceitful indifference. The marginally fortunate are underemployed tradesmen, craftsmen, artisans, athletes and entertainers--the real Houdini's of society, escape artists who eke-out a bare bones existence. One of these is the hauntingly beautiful and melancholy Ann Darrow, a stage actress blessed with essential vaudevillian skills, yet possessing an uncommon taste for literature, particularly the insightful, allegorical tomes of author and playwright, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody). We sympathize with Ann since she has lost the support of her grandfatherly mentor who, after one too many failures on the Great White Way, has decided to return, disheartened, to hometown, Chicago, to test fate in yet another urban jungle. With this turn of events, Ann is forced to forage hand-to-mouth; it begins her descent into the ranks of the nameless underclass. Temptation approaches her in a Mephistophelian offer to sell her soul to venality, in a burlesque act, in exchange for material subsistence, whichshe rejects, knowing full well the alternative will forever taint her spirit. Ann's hell is unforgiving. So, too, is Kong's. His is the lost world of Skull Island, a foliated tropic in the uncharted high seas, inhabited by carnivorous, Jurassic-styled reptiles, monstrous arthropods and, as unlikely as it seems, Paleolithic mammals indigenous to the last ice age. They are the true masters of their \\"Johnny-come-lately\\" adversaries--Homo sapiens, represented by ritually obsessed Bushmen, and their less evolved, 20th Century cousins, self-absorbed actors, including the inimitable Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler). His film crew is \\"misled\\" by the impetuous Carl Denham (Jack Black), which has been navigated by \\"take `em back alive\\" gunrunners and poachers, commanded by the mercenary merchant marine, Captain Englehorn (Thomas Kretchmann), and mates. No question, Peter Jackson enjoys poking fun at himself and his industry. <br /> <br />Both venues bear witness to the irrepressible brutality of mortal life stewarded without solace--except for the saving grace of a self-enlightened Darrow (Watts) whose landing party on Skull Island spoils the impending sacrifice of a young bush girl to assuage the Great Kong. She finds herself the intended replacement and is fastidiously abducted by the tribe for this purpose. Before long, Kong catches-up with Ann, and so begins one of most unusual romances in film history, fraught with mistrust and fear before easing into mutual respect and platonic love. In a memorable scene, Ann shimmers in the dawning light like Venus, the morning star, staying Kong's killing hand just long enough for them to worship the beauty of a sunrise. The moment mesmerizes them as they perch atop a cliff in Kong's inhospitable backyard and watch the fiery globe, magnified on the horizon, kiss the illuminated Sea goodbye, for another day, as it gently lifts itself from the latter's swelling embrace. Unbeknownst to them, destiny will oblige them to witness this miracleagain, in Ann's backyard, atop the less hospitable Empire State Building. Beauty and Beast will gaze wondrously eastward--this time, in the direction of Lady Liberty, the imperishable light of the new world. <br /> <br />Screenwriters Fran Walsh, Philipa Boyens, and Peter Jackson do not conceal the mythical allegory of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Just how close they came in having the \\"Eighth Wonder of the World,\\" brilliantly played by Andy Serkis, wrestle away Jimmy's (Jamie Bell) overdue copy of the author's celebrated novella and whack us upside the head with it is anyone's best guess. Weta's Argonauts beckon us to plumb the depths of Conrad's classic to draw deeper meaning from the poignant references to \\"beauty and the beast\\" that Merrion Cooper and Edgar Wallace cleverly dialoged for Fay Wray (Watt's uncanny, look-alike sister from another generation) and co-star Bruce Cabot (RKO Pictures, Inc., 1933; Turner and Warner Bros. Entertainment, 2006). With a little imagination, however, something of an 800--um--8000-pound Simian variant of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, loosely smattered with critical themes and elements from Dante's \\"Divine Comedy\\" (1308-21), lurk beneath the surface--just don't tell the ape! <br /> <br />Ann Darrow's (Watts) unfaltering devotion hews the beast--and us. Once a tortured, hungering soul, she emerges from her descent into the abyss free and awakened, having overcome her mortal fears and personal demons. She has \\"bared\\" her soul to the sinister vagaries of a fickle existence in two jungles, tapping into a heretofore-unknown reservoir of courage to placate a lumbering beast. She amuses him with a smile, a dance, and a tear, and after an icy, nighttime romp through frigid Central Park, shows him the Way--a solitary, spiritual journey from the Circles of Hell to Paradise through Purgatory that is fraught with obstacles, temptations, and unimaginable punishments. None proved worse, however, than Kong's shameful abduction, with which she relates. Shackled against nature's will and voyeuristically exploited for others' entertainment, Kong is tormented by a faithless substitute for Beauty since Ann will have no part in this deception. Doom is the ultimate destiny for Man and Beast, but it is their only hope as well, just as the gods intended. Ann's journey, however, will detour along a dubious path, in an unlikely encounter with Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), always the object of her refined affection. Divine intervention worked through the most profane of men, Carl Denham (Black), ensnared Jack into Ann's existential journey. When others would have left her for dead in the woods or waters of Skull Island, Jack tenaciously searched for her. Eclipsed by Kong and shadowed in his wake until the Beast's catastrophic fall from grace, Jack never gave-up on Beauty, not as someone Ann Darrow could love. Like Dante's Beatrice, at whose request the philosopher, Virgil, interceded to guide their ascent into Paradise, Kong's attraction to the \\"mourning\\" star brought Ann to the pinnacle of her dreadful world and, in the darkest hour of her bereavement, Jack arrived in time to lift her to the stars. <br /> <br />And you thought King Kong was the ultimate B movie.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I have been a fan of \\"The Snowman\\" since I was a child, and have watched it so many times that I have worn out many VHS tapes. So, when I saw that they were releasing it on DVD WITH the David Bowie introduction (which is wonderful) I was ecstatic. The DVD is amazing and the quality is excellent, I cannot recommend this DVD enough, the only drawback is that it clearly states that the Bowie introduction is on the DVD and it is not. This is no fault of Amazon, or the DVD. Please note, that even thought I am horribly saddened by the omission on the DVD, I am still giving \\"The Snowman\\" five stars because it is a wonderful treat and this is an excellent copy of it.
B000GIWS7E|4.0|Congratulations to DT for having the GUTS to put this brilliant concert together. It must have been a huge concern to them that the orchestra would swamp, dilute or kill the precision of their riff and time changes. It is a testament to their professionalism that none of this happened and that can only have come through hours and hours of rehearsal.    I think \\"die hard\\" fans, of which I dont really think I could call myself despite my love of ther band, are missing the point a little if they criticise this DVD.    Firstly, I have absolutely NO complaints on sound ( JP was as clear as ever on my system, and for the first time, John M was as clear as a bell .. he is WAY better than I thought he was!) and the DVD editing was a lesson in how to record a concert. The set was perhaps a little overlit to ensure superior video, but that is a trade off you have to make if you want superb visuals.    Second, DT have always given value for money in not covering the same songs over and over again, simply at a different venue, a different year and with a few more wrinkles ... it was really nice to see something different. I did find the energy level sank a little during the early part of the second set, but that is perhaps because I did not know Octavarium. But the fact that the song selection was not old and stale made up for this.    The main point though, is that this was clearly FUN for the band to do. Not a word you immediately connect to DT. Score is not DT as you would normally see them ... probably never again ... but this was a chance for them to showcase their talents in a fun and challenging way, and JLB and MP were clearly having a great time. After 20 years, they deserve this \\"once in a lifetime\\" indulgent(?)performance     If I was desperately trying to find fault, my only small concern is that DT seem to be \\"smoothing off\\" their peformances and the raw, biting, brain churning challenge of their early work is being replaced by a more smoothed out, mature performance. Perhaps it is because they are become so GOOd, that everything just looks simple. However, I am not totally sure. At one point ( I cant remember which song it was ) Genesis came to mind and for a fleeting moment I could see Mike Portnoy becoming the new Phil Collins ... Shut Up, Ian, you FOOL !!. Whilst that \\"maturing\\" is a good thing for JLB and his singing is the best I have heard it, it perhaps reduces the sheer excitment of the music.... a bit more blood and sweat would have added that last star for me !     Once again, congratulations for the skill, vision, staying power and sheer guts to perform this concert, and thanks for producing a near perfect record of the event for us not lucky enough to be there.     DT have proved it .... length of hair is NOT a factor in producing superb music.
0688014291|4.0|This classic is based on the premise that it doesn't take much to \\"get very big results from people.\\"  In fact, it takes about a minute... a well-timed minute.  Start by setting goals with employees.  Each goal should take no longer than a minute to read.  The manager then looks for progress made toward the goals and \\"catches people doing things right\\" rewarding them with 1 minute of praise.  Conversely, when things are not done well, the manager takes about a minute to reprimand the employee.   <br /> <br />Basically, it's about timely and honestly communicating with employees, a practice which is severely lacking virtually everywhere. If managers actually followed the simple advice of this book, there's no telling what they could accomplish.  It's a quick, easy, and very beneficial read. <br /> <br />-- Nick McCormick, Author, Lead Well and Prosper

B000FS9FCQ|3.0|November 5th is Guy Fawkes night, where the British light bonfires in memory of Guy Fawkes, who attempted assassination of King and Parliament with a plan to blow up Westminster Palace.  'V For Vendetta' plays off the Fawkes legend, bringing it into the future with a sane and cultivated hero who hides behind a mask.<br /><br />'V' (Hugo Weaving), as he identifies himself, has been a victim of the oppressive political overthrowing of a free government, and decides that revolution and death are the only answers to the world's problems.  Despite the dark sound of his schemes, it makes sense in the wake of the current leader's greed and incompetence.  Just before his first message to the government, he rescues Evey (Natalie Portman) from a savaging from being out after curfew.<br /><br />'V' and Evey meet up again as 'V' takes over a public broadcast, and this time Evey help him in return for his kindness to her.  'V' then takes her to his underground hideout to keep her safe for one year, until next November 5th when he plans to carry out his designs for a new government.  When Evey gets away from 'V', he doesn't stop her.<br /><br />But neither 'V' or the government are through with Evey.  Evey becomes a prisoner and is tortured, emerging a stronger person from it.  Lots of secrets are revealed at this time, Evey's torturer, 'V's reasoning, and other sideline plots that were boring and belonged in a movie like 'Sleepless In Seattle' rather than 'V For Vendetta'.  'V' plans on bringing Evey in on his little November 5th celebration, whether she likes it or not, but not until he has taken care of his own personal business.<br /><br />'V For Vendetta' could have been a great movie if they had stuck to a darker vein and left out all the distracting touchie-feelie moments.  About the middle of the movie, where the 'emotional' aspect really takes off, is where I got lost, and bored, and began to see this film as a passing bow to the movie-rating God.  I would rather have seen 'V' more as a John Creasy from 'Man On Fire' than a sap who gives up his cause.  Perhaps the producers were a little too frightened by 911, thinking \\"terrorist\\" rather than \\"revolutionist\\", but because of the wishy-washy convictions of 'V' it simply turned into a sappy movie with a few scenes of excellent knifework and some stylish photography.<br /><br />My recommendation is to rent first, and make up your own mind.  Enjoy!have seen 'V' more as a John Creasy from 'Man On Fire' than a sap who gives up his cause.

0743289412|5.0|The appeal of this book is wide.  Although not \\"pure\\" horror, I think that fans of other King horror will enjoy this book.  If you're a fan of his Dark Tower series, I believe you will find another example of King at his best here.  If you've never read any Stephen King, this novel would be a fine place to see what he is capable of crafting.    Having read other Stephen King novels, it's obvious that he can skillfully manipulate the English language.  However, King's playfulness and joy shines through in this work.  A recurring theme is \\"going to the Pool\\", the pool of ideas, words, imagination, and that is exactly what King delivers to you.  I have to agree with other reviewers that some of his word play becomes annoying; for me, it was the nicknames for the sisters.  I understand that the nicknames were symbolic of the sisterly bond, but after a while you have to wonder if Lisey didn't feel a bit silly calling her middle-aged sister \\"big sissa Manda Bunny\\".    Other than the incessant nicknames, the characters were likable and believable.  The pacing of the book works well.  Some might feel that it was too slow, but I think character development would have suffered if the pace had been any faster.  The plot is well developed with no loose ends left at the end and just disturbing enough to make me think twice about eating fruit after dark.
B000IOM1RI|5.0|This disk and the Movie rocks!! My socks were blown off the continent. As far as this album is concerned, think of it as mini rock opera. With guest appearances by Meat Loaf and Dio and David Grohl at the kit, it just totally rocks. Obviously, the first album is a classic and difficult to top, but this one certainly brings great moments to the table. Also consider that the first album had comedic skits which served as filler. The D could've repeated verses and chorus to give you nay sayers the song length you desire, but that is not their style. This is the D for God's sake, and they defy any formula but their own. Where are the true D faithful and why haven't they risen to quash the horrific reviews of those too inane to see beyond the limits of their pop horizons. Nay to you, nay sayers. The D rules!!

It's like the movie just meanders along and then stops. It's more like a long episode of a TV series than a movie. <br /> <br />I gave the movie three stars instead of two, though, because despite it's problems, it was still enjoyable (I give it this because I like most Superman shows, except Superman 4). Also, if a decent sequal comes along, these problems might be resolved or at least dramatically reduced. If left on its own, though, I'd have to drop it at least one more star, if not two. <br /> <br />(If Singer wanted to do a Superman movie, it might have been a good idea to do a stand alone rather than try to make a sequal to a 20 year old movie. He could have made a movie adaptation of the death/return of Superman comic storyline.)
B00005JNS0|4.0|Cars (Widescreen Edition)~ Owen Wilson is a good animated movie that I feel is a bit too oriented towards the American market. Most people in the rest of the world do not watch Nascar and therefore many of the Nascar references are lost on people that do not watch it. The animation is great, the storyline is well written, the music is really good. The message of the movie is that one needs to take responsibility for ones actions, be tolerant and not be haughty. The story centers around a haughty race car called Lightning McQueen that learns respect, tolerance and the true meaning of family. It started out poorly and just became better and better. But still I give it 4 stars out of 5.
B000IJ79V6|4.0|The following gripes I have are mainly related to the Donner cut DVD, but I've also summarized various issues with the theatrical version.<br /><br />The Superman II theatrical movie (by Richard Lester) isn't the same as the TV movie I remember seeing in the 80s.. nor is the Donner cut DVD. Apparently, the TV version was the Lester cut, with some of Donner's best scenes integrated in. It is refreshing to see never-before-seen footage from the Donner cut, but by no means is it superior to Lester's version. In fact, many of the scenes are terrible...<br /><br />Donnor Cut Version:<br /><br />1) For example, the opening scene showing the credits and highlights from the first movie are gone. The John Williams score is still there, but it is a shortened (and less effective) track.<br />2) Also, they took out the Eiffel Tower scene and replaced it with Lois jumping out of the Daily Planet building.<br />3) Lex Luthor and Miss Tessmacher scenes when they first enter Superman's Fortress are new, but dialogue is no better than the Lester scenes. The tv version's hackman seemed like he wasn't over-acting. It featured a close-up view of Hackman's face, where he says \\"think of it.. three super villains, all with the same wonderful contempt for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\".<br />4) Niagra Falls is included, but the part where Clark trips and lands on the fireplace is replaced by a ludicrous scene of Lois shooting a gun filled with blanks.<br />5) Marlon Brando scenes were dissapointing. Whereas Superman's interaction with his holographic mother, Lara, was compassionate, his meeting with Jor-El seemed confrontational, portraying Superman as a spoiled teenager.<br />6) And towards the end, Superman flies back in time to undo the damage done by General Zod.. an \\"anticlimax\\" indeed, Lex Luthor!<br /><br />As a general comment, Reeve's appearance in several \\"restored\\" scenes - like his physique and hair - is inconsistent with the rest of the movie. Overall, the Donner Cut felt like a compilation of deleted scenes.<br /><br />Moving on to the theatrical version, some missing scenes which I thought took away substantially from the film include the following...<br /><br />Theatrical Version (Lester Cut):<br /><br />1) Concorde scene<br />2) Luthor's funny comment to Otis in the prison laundry room, \\"Otis, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate.\\"<br />3) Nasa personnel: \\"All right, which one of you guys is using a hair dryer?\\"<br />4) Lex Luthor's unique North Pole dialogue (mentioned above in Donner's cut).<br />5) When the US army approaches the three villains, Non first gestures to Zod for permission before unleashing his heat vision.<br />6) Luthor's witty response to Zod, \\"No, Jor-El the baseball player!\\"<br />7) A few missing scenes of the New York battle. One example includes Zod's comment to Superman, \\"It is extremely likely you are merely a fool. Like father, like son.\\"<br />8) Superman grabbing the S from his chest and throwing at Non (some people think it's corny, but I found it fascinating as a child..a super power no one has ever seen before).<br />9) Humorous response from tough-looking bald guy whom Clark accidentally bumps into, \\"Hey, try sleeping at night, buster!\\". This fluidly transitions to the hotdog diner scene where Clark was brutally beaten up as a human.<br /><br />I am wishing they would release the ABC-TV version.

B000J10ERO|3.0|Bryan Singer + iconic superhero = money in the bank?  Not quite.     <br /> <br />Pacing: Richard Donner's 1978 Superman movie had three distinct sections, each with its own pacing.  Donner took us from the cold technology of Krypton, to the wide-open sky and fields of Kansas, to the claustrophobic hustle bustle of Metropolis.  With a couple of short exceptions, Singer's movie had the same, ponderous pacing and claustrophobic feel throughout.   And speaking of claustrophobic, if any movie has too many close-ups, this is it. <br /> <br />Script:  In an interview, the screenwriters said that they made a point to make Superman a citizen of the world, not just the US.  They even went so far as to delete the line \\"...and the American Way\\" from Superman's slogan (which was there since the 50's).  So through news clips they show Superman saving people falling off buildings the world over.  To think he would have the time or awareness to be Johnny-on-the-spot all over the world stretches the credibility of even a super-hero movie.  And to believe that he could have been the same character if he was raised anywhere other than the heartland of America is ridiculous.  If you don't understand or respect Superman's \\"fly-over states\\" roots, you shouldn't be writing his script. <br /> <br />Acting: Kevin Spacey was stuck on \\"smug\\", Brandon Routh is bland as both Superman and Clark Kent, and Kate Bosworth portrayed Lois Lane like a cub reporter, not a Pulizer Prize winner. Hurray for Parker Posey who actually did something fun with the material.   <br /> <br />Atmosphere:  The environments do not feel fleshed out.  Judging by this movie, three people live in Kansas (and one of them is an alien), Metropolis doesn't have police/news copters or Coast Guard support, and there is no sense of urgency at the Daily Planet.  Deadlines?  What deadlines?  It all felt superficial.  These weren't living, breathing environments, these were cardboard set pieces for Superman to fly around and through. <br /> <br />Add it together and you get a missed opportunity.  There are some nice touches here and there but not enough to give it more than three stars.  Perhaps Mr. Singer will hit a better balance of action and story in the inevitable sequel.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0920668372|5.0|This book is special to me because it makes my mom cry, which is no easy feat.  My mom is a very emotionally cautious, tough individual, and to see her let down her guard and openly weep when reading this shows me just how much she relates to the mother in this story who overcomes all obstacles (physically and emotionally) to be there for her child always to comfort him, and then to have that child return her unending love for him.  My mom cannot even look at the cover of this book in stores or at home.  Writing this review even makes me cry.  It's a very touching story.  I don't even think I could read this to my own daughter without crying.  It makes you feel like there's nothing better than to have the reciprocal love of a parent/child.

1596912367|3.0|This well written book is a clever historical espionage thriller. Alternating between WWII and recent modern Britain, Restless is the stories of 2 women, a mother and daughter.  The mother turns out to have had a hidden history as a spy during WWII which may be coming back to haunt her.  The daughter is at a crossroads in her personal and professional lives.  The story of the mother dominates the book.  A weakness of the book is that the daughter's story seems almost like a accretion, not adding much more than window dressing to the whole story.  Character development is fair and the basic plot mechanism, revealed in a somewhat clunky fashion at the end, is far-fetched.
B000H0MKOC|2.0|The Eckhart character is deliberately hobbled and stereotyped as a debater in order to make the ridiculous and shrill nanny staters look dignified and credible when they are not.  A high school debator could have made a better promotion.  For example, like so many involved in statist leftist causes designed to limit individual freedom, there is a refusal to learn anything about the marketplace and how it works-mainly out of an absolute abhorrence of capitalism.  Big tobacco is Big, for instance, because they sell products people want.  It is nearly impossible to create a need rather than meet it.  This is why tobacoo companies now sell smoking cessation aids, etc.<br /><br />I can just hear the comments coming in, so BTW, championing freedom and allowing that adults like to make their own choices is not \\"whining.\\"<br /><br />This movie just reeks of a truly repellent smug self-consciousness that feels instantly overwrought and tired.  Note: you can't be funny and politically correct.
B00005JOX6|2.0|Everytime an Adam Sandler movie comes along, I somehow get talked into watching it and, yes, everytime, I come away dissappointed. This one was no exception. Maybe I'm just too old to \\"get\\" this kind of humor but for me, it just wasn't funny. This one has a \\"Cat's in the Cradle\\" theme which is okay in and of itself. The whole message of slow down and enjoy life while it lasts, and keep your priorities is order, is sage advice for us all, but the movie itself was just a total bore. Christopher Walken is his usual superb self, but has really only a bit part here. This is two hours of my life I wish I had back.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|There were all of four people in the theater when I went to see Stay on its opening night last year. But we were the lucky ones, because we showed up to see something rare: an inventive, imaginative, wholly remarkable film; the kind that doesn't happen nearly often enough. It was a great night for me. I had no idea what I was in store for, and the film was an other-worldly experience. I would urge you to see it, but then I'm not entirely convinced that the film can survive the transition to the TV screen. Stay is a delicate flower of a film that just might only blossom on a theater screen with an attentive audience. For me, this is Marc Forster's finest film. You might have seen Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland, and you might have liked those films, but they won't prepare you for Stay. It's just as well, because I'm convinced the less you know about the film, the better the chance that you may have of connecting with it. I don't even want to go into its details, for fear of ruining it for someone else who may have a legitimate chance of experiencing it the way I did. I wish I could give you the night I had when I saw this film, because it was quite unforgettable.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|In my opinion this Donner Cut of Superman II is superior to The Lester version, and I really had a kick watching it. <br />I was truly excited, in this version, because it was like seeing Superman II for the first time. It made much more sense to me. The Lester version has always bored me.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The title is no hype because if we don't change our way of doing things, there won't be a planet to live on. Well, the planet will be here, but humans won't if we continue adding to greenhouse gases, warming the planet beyond what the human body can sustain. This documentary is like a prophetic warning about what might occur if we continue business as usual. <br /> <br />When I saw this film in theaters (I even went for a second time, bringing a friend along, and then I went to the actual presentation by President Gore in person), it had the amazing effect of making me finally let go of my anger and outrage over the stolen election of 2000. This film's success proves that there are second acts in politics. While I still believe Gore would have been a great president and we wouldn't be in the mess we're in now if he was allowed to assume the presidency, I think what he's doing as a private citizen is far more important for our world than the mere presidency. He's a true statesman, speaking his passion, with the knowledge he's accumulated during his time in public service. <br /> <br />One of the most surprising facts presented in this film is that American automakers cannot sell cars in China because our cars don't meet their auto emissions standards! China is fast becoming the world's largest economy and for our auto companies to be shut out of that market is not helping our big three get out of the red, as they continue to shut down factories and laying off American workers. Yes, there is a better way of doing business. The future of business is green and Europe is well ahead of the game on that. What makes capitalism successful is innovation and competition for the best product at the lowest cost...yet here we have these bloated oil companies who don't want to grab onto new technologies until after the all the oil is consumed. By that point, it will be too late and our economy will suffer. Change needs to begin, like, yesterday! <br /> <br />When this film came out, so many reviewers asked where this funny, personable Gore was in 2000. What a wash! Though Gore did play it safe in 2000, he's still the same as he was in 2000. The media has their own amnesia going on, as Bush was the one who faked his way to the oval office. The media preferred to focus on the false scandals of analyzing every statement Gore made and playing it up as \\"lies\\" (case in point, Gore never claimed to invent the Internet, only that as Senator, he took the initiative in helping to bring the technology about so the private citizen can benefit from what was once a military/national security way of communicating). By their blind scrutiny of one candidate instead of another, it turns out the biggest liar got into the White House while the exaggerator had to find new work. <br /> <br />Though I am a huge supporter of Gore and wish he was the president, I'm not sure the success of this film is enough to rightfully bring him to the White House. Cleaning up Bush's mess will be a big part of the next administration and the surplus won't be there to make the kind of changes that a President Gore could have made in 2001-2009. I personally think his role is more important...that of statesmen, bringing this message and prophetic warning about global warming to mass consciousness in the world (not just in America).  So, with that, please see this film and get everyone you know to see it. More importantly, please make lifestyle changes to lessen one's impact on our environment. After all, the Native Americans were on to something when they said that we don't pass on the environment to our children, we BORROW it from our grandchildren.
B000JBXXZ4|4.0|Well, fans, here it is the newest cd by Incubus and to say the least a great cd. Mike,Ben and Jose get the spotlight, continuing their great wrok on ACLOTM and the live dvd. I saw them on Puerto Rico when they came here and they really are a great team. Now, on the cd, IT is a great cd, once you get the fact that theyhave grown up. To everyone that says it isnt good, how you feel if a band you like put out the same sound on their cd's year after year??? We have to accept the fact that they are on a different bandwagon sound-wise than most of the bands that came out with them. Anyone remember Korn,LB,Papa Roach, etc..??Sure , they are great bands, and i like them but they had the same sound over and over. Incubus, much like Radiohead but without comparing them, never sounds the same disc after disc. Songs like Dig, Paper Shoes, Earth to bella,Quicksand, Are great, just like AnnaMolly, Light Grenades are for the rockers. We have to accept the fact that, yes, Incubus are now showing why they are still out there making music, regardless of the trends...
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Good grief Charlie Brown - hopelessness in the human condition, smothering our gasping souls with all of the crass commercialism and focus on materialistic hedonism, you'd think there still may be some promise of redemption in our crazy little corporate dominated world - MAYBE GET BACK WHAT WAS LOST???<br /><br />But grief can be good when channeled toward a higher purpose with the caring LOVE of well-made, purposefully created and uplifting, beautiful MUSIC.  Ian and the band have carried home the needy, sad little laughable (Christmas) tree and transformed it - neatly arranged with baubles, bangles and shining colorful lights into a heart-warming centerpiece for the holidays (topped by the angel of PEACE offering prayer for better days).  Orpheus has struck up the Lyre and the heavenly spheres are in motion (as are the nagging feelings that a true Christmas healing will not materialize EVER unless we begin to see the inequality that we engender with our cold, calculated system of blame-shifting, bean-counting and Calvinistic us vs. them hording).  Listen can you hear:<br /><br />\\"... So how can you laugh when your own mother's hungry, and how can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong?  And if I've just messed up your thoughtless pleasures, remember if you wish, this is just a Christmas song ...\\" (Christmas Song)<br /><br />\\"... Now, as the last broad oak leaf falls, we beg, consider this: There's some who have no coin to save for turkey, wine or gifts.  ... As holly pricks and Ivy clings, your fate is none too clear.

All homely comforts blown away and all that's left to show is to share your joy at Christmas time with Jack Frost and the hooded crow.\\" (Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow)<br /><br />The messages shared are too important to over-emphasize the great instrumental performances throughout this whole recording by all band members (and Barre is such a pro!  there is some fantastic playing on here by him) - really classy!

B000IJ79WU|5.0|There is a lot of misconception that the \\"Donner Cut\\" is an entirely new cut. It is not.  The truth is this was not actually cut together by Richard Donner himself, but rather by editor Michael Thau under Donner's creative supervision utilizing all of the available footage that he originally shot and should be considered to be a \\"reconstruction\\" of Director Richard Donner's original film had he been allowed to complete it before he was unceremoniously fired by producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind.  Fans expecting some miraculous reconstitution of Superman II or an entirely new version of the film altogether may be setting their expectations way too high.  The Donner cut still utilizes much of the footage shot by Richard Lester to maintain a cohesive film but with alternate takes and unseen footage, this is the version of Superman II you have never seen before. It also includes screen tests shot by Donner of Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder standing in lieu of unshot scenes resulting in an uncomfortably abbreviated romantic plotline between Lois and Supes.  To be fair, most of the scenes shot by Richard Lester for the theatrical version fleshed out most of the stronger dynamic chemistry between the characters with snappier and more memorable dialogue.  Lines like \\"General, would you care to step outside?\\" have been replaced with less-quotable lines like \\"General, have you ever heard of Freedom of the Press?\\" or Lex Luthor's sarcastic quips like \\"When will these dummies learn to use a doorknob?\\" are notably missed but make the overall tone less comedic than Lester's slapstick comical farce and more to-the-point.<br /><br />However, Donner's Superman reigns supreme with it's restoration of Marlon Brando's deleted scenes as Jor-El and the prophecy of \\"The father becomes the son and the son becomes the father\\" recited in the first film is finally realized here.  In the theatrical version, the exposition that takes place in the Fortress of Solitude occurs between Kal-El and his mother Lara.  When the studio did not want to pay Brando millions of dollars to be billed in the sequel, the footage was re-shot with Susannah York instead.  There was a genuine sentimental emotion shared in those scenes between Kal-El and his mother that is lost in the Donner version but the restoration of Brando's Jor-El into the film gives it more weight and redemption as a second half of the historical first film.<br /><br />The opening sequence with Lois taken hostage by terrorists at the Eiffel Tower have thankfully been replaced by a much more satisfying introduction of Lois' suspicion that Clark is Superman.  There is an urgency to the plot as General Zod, Ursa and Non escape from their imprisonment in the Phantom Zone and descend upon the Ear... er... \\"Planet Houston\\" and come off much more sinister and threatening adversaries this time around. Additionally, John William's original score has been fully restored with additional cues from Ken Thorne's theatrical scoring.<br /><br />The controversial ending is the target for much cynacism and debate amongst fans and while it may come off to some as a cheapened recycling of the original film's ending, it is much more satisfying than say Lester's laughible scenes where Superman throws a big cheesy plastic \\"S\\" at Non or the ridiculously inexplicable teleportation game of hide-and-seek by projecting multiple images of himself to psych-out Zod and his cronies are definitely not the least bit missed.<br /><br />Fans will argue and debate over the better of the two cuts for years to come but thankfully we have both versions to compare and contrast.  In an age where re-edits of popular films run rampant on the internet, I'm sure someone is already busy constructing their own cut of the film that is an amalgamation of the best scenes of both compiled into one Suped-up fanboy-edit.  There may never be a \\"definitive\\" version of Superman II, but this reconstruction of Donner's film is a welcomed alternative andthankfully we will always have both now that the real Superman, Christopher Reeve, returns.have both now that the real Superman, Christopher Reeve, returns.

Who when they made music it was like marriage in compliments. That was the best combination in music history I have to say.

Martin is the only man aside from The Beatles themselves who could pull off something like this.  The man is pure genius.  The sound gives all the songs new life, clear and crisp, almost like being right there in the studio with the Fab4 themselves. <br /> <br />A great gift for any Beatles fan or any music lover.  A good way to introduce the young ones to their music too, my niece (9) adores the album too.

From the time he said his first word (kitty) and could identify the cat's picture in the book, he has had a wonderful time learning the animals' names.

I have enjoyed how the book has grown with him, first learning the animals, then making their sounds when he sees them and soon he will be learning colors, and someday reading it himself.
0440234743|2.0|This is my first Grisham book. A friend suggested I read it since I'm into \\"spiritual things.\\" <br /> <br />First of all, I read a lot. And I mean a lot. Maybe that is the problem, I have read too many excellent books. This one is sloppy, full of repetitive prose, cliches, flat characters, and a sappy, predictable ending. The main character's \\"conversion\\" was fast, tidy, and neat. Suddenly he was Mr. Christian. That is not real life. Christians struggle after conversion and do not change overnight. The whole Dr. Missionary  in the Dream bit (or...WOW! was she really there speaking to him?) was so predictable I kept reading hoping I was wrong about that. Unfortunately I was right. So when I finally finished, I couldn't believe Mr. Grisham is a millionaire or whatever because of his books. But I don't blame him. If the mainstream likes predictable, shallow, sloppy prose, then that's just reality. <br /> <br />I liked the movies okay based on his earlier novels. I think I'll stick to the movies. <br /> <br />I give him two stars for plot progression and the ability to sell the darn thing.
0688170528|1.0|After reading The Pact the only thought i had was , well that was a waste of time. At a hefty 496 pages it was not a short read. I expected to feel a sense of accomplishment when I finished reading it, not remorse. This book was predictable, kinda boring, and contrived. It reads like a made for tv movie. Same old predictable plot twists and characters, and an ending that falls flat. I never cared very much for the characters, their actions were often annoying and somewhat dumb. I just don't buy it. It starts out very idyllic , so much so that it may inspire gagging and then supposedly these golden teenagers turn dark. And not even in an interesting way. subplots with the parents are also boring and predictable. And the one kind of intersting character, the lawyer, isn't someone we get to see a whole lot of.  <br />   The one good thing the book does is move forward, not at a very quick pace but still if you apprecaite books that are all plot and no depth this is for you . There are some attempts at discussing incestuous relationships and parent child relationships but in the end the book imparts no meaning, makes no interesting statements on life or death.  Bottom line - If you're looking for something with depth and beauty look elsewhere.
051788710X|5.0|When you're in new territory, it helps to have a map from someone who's been there. Dreaming consciously was new territory for me and in this book Robert Moss provided a reliable map to help me navigate more effectively. I had always listened to my dream voice with the intuitive part of my brain and interpreted its wisdom symbolically. From Moss I learned to first ask what reality in daily life this dream could be telling me about. Dreaming has become a very practical guide to good decision making and has alerted me to very practical dangers. A small example - I dreamed of a good friend pulling up beside me on the right side of my car and pointing at the tire. On waking, I looked carefully at the passenger side of the car, which I very seldom do, and found that the fairly new right front tire was unexpectedly flat. I immediately got it fixed and was on my way safely and without a major hassle. Thank you Robert Moss for sharing your practical approach in Conscious Dreaming!
B000J10EQU|3.0|SUPERMAN RETURNS is actually closer to the original intention of comic books for kids than most of the other incarnations.  Kids bought comic books for the color, the action, the hero who represents the guy who can set a ditzy world straight, and a bunch of feel good sidebars that pay homage to mothers, other kids, bad guys defeated, and the open end for yet another installment.<br /><br />Bryan Singer directs this outing with a degree of simple distinction that holds the piece together.  The story is Superman's return from a five year hiatus in Krypton to bring meaning to the lives of the planet earth.  His mother (Eva Marie Saint) has grown old but still believes in her absentee son, a young hunk Brandon Roth who has little more to do in this film but cast his innocent blue eyes in the direction of evil and be supported by all the CGI props that allow him to fly around the world saving things (Routh may be able to act but he is not given enough lines to let us know this time around).  Lo and behold Lois Lane (a fine Kate Bosworth) is still around but now a mother to the next Superman and living with the nice guy co-editor Richard (the fine James Marsden), the editor being Perry White (Frank Langella).  Once Superman returns to earth he is challenged by the evil Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey embodying evil) with his loopy girlfriend Kitty (the scene stealing, very fine Parker Posey!).<br /><br />The rest of the film is primarily special effects: Lex discovers a crystal form Krypton that can grow into a whole evil world if not checked.  But of course good wins out over evil and it all comes to a slightly teary and funny conclusion.<br /><br />The thing about this version is that it doesn't take itself seriously.  This is an escapist film just as comic books were escapist items for kids.  And it works.  Grady Harp, December 06
0743298020|1.0|\\"Diane Setterfield will keep you guessing, make you wonder, move you to tears and laughter, and, in the end, deposit you breathless yet satisfied back upon the shore of your everyday life.\\"    That's what the book jacket says. Don't believe it - clearly the copywriter was not reading the same text.  While this isn't the most horrible book I've read this year (though definitely in the bottom five), it has been WAY over-hyped, most especially by Barnes n' Noble.    The Thirteenth Tale and I started on the wrong foot -- having been compared to Jane Eyre and having stolen from Jane Eyre (you know, fire-ravaged house, crazy relative locked away, and an innocent entering that world), I expected more. And when the book didn't deliver, then I just found the device to be pretentious. I mean, who compares their own book to Jane Eyre, for god's sake?    A better choice would have been Flowers in the Attic. Every character has some freakish story (evil twin, dead conjoined twin, abandoned baby, etc) and every character is unlikeable for one reason or another (evil being the central affliction, along with boring, naive or too one-dimensional). Add to that a healthy helping of incest and abuse, and you have Flowers in the Attic for the erudite.    The biggest problem with the novel is that the premise is unconvinving, and a novel cannot survive that. We are introduced to Vida Winter, England's most famous living novelist, who has invited our dull and mousy protagonist to write her life story. In short order, we learn that her uncle has an unhealthy (to put it mildly) fixation on her mother, and their coupling produces two very disturbed children, twin girls, Adeline and Emmeline. I won't ruin the story for those who are still interested by detailing it, except to say that Adeline (who has been presented as Vida Winter, pre name change) is an evil child who delights in beating her twin mercilessly and destroying whatever she is able to get her hands on. That's fine (we're back toFlowers in the Attic again), but it is entirely unbelievable that this child has grown up into a productive adult, ie Vida Winter. So, at the end of the novel, when the big \\"shocking\\" plot turn rolls around to work this out, it's not all that shocking. It just takes 300+ pages to get to the explanation of what was obvious from the beginning. 300 VERY long pages.    With so many great books out there, don't waste your time with this one.
0446528056|1.0|I've read all of Mr. Sparks' book and have loved every single one of them. They always seem to \\"grab\\" me and not let go until I'm finished. This one however, didn't hold my interest. <br /> <br />I don't really know what happened with this book. Was it written to fulfill a contract obligation? It's not like a true Sparks' novel at all. <br /> <br />First of all, I didn't care for the characters. I felt nothing for John or the vacuous Savannah. It was just so much filler. Too much going to war, waiting at home, it seemed to be just something to fill up the page. <br /> <br />I did feel a little for John's dad. I felt sorry for him and truly hated it when he died.  <br /> <br />But going into a Sparks novel you know someone is going to die. And it usually breaks your heart. I usually care, I usually cry, this didn't warrant that. <br /> <br />I gave it only one star because I know Mr. Sparks is capable of so much more. Hopefully, we will see that before long.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|Richard Donner is a genius. I am the biggest Superman Fan and just bought the Ultimate Superman Collection. After watching the Superman II the Donner cut, I got the chills. It was so much better. It got rid of scenes which were pointless. Although I liked the fight scene from Lester's Fortress of Solitude, the ending scene by Donner fits better with the movie theme. The sound effects are much better as well as the speed of the special effects. I recommend anyone who likes these movies to buy it.
B00005Q45W|5.0|What can one say about this CD that hasn't already been said here?<br />Let me add my 2 cents...<br /><br />I had not listened to it all the way through for a while.<br />I just did following my watching the recent film on Leonard.<br /><br />I agree that it is by no means a perfect 10.<br />I had the same response upon first hearing that many have already mentioned:<br />the musical production left me somewhat disappointed,<br />except for \\"By The River's Dark,\\" which grabbed me from the get-go!<br /><br />But eventually I got over that and did what I always have done with Leonard's songs: give myself over to his poetic fire! Then I enter this evocative-provocative world-of-words that only a man who has gone to the edges and back--and live to tell about it--can craft.<br /><br />There are six perfect songs here: these alone make it a 5-star CD.<br />They are deep, rich and trance-inducing: they keep on giving light and delight even after many listenings:<br /><br />\\"A Thousand Kisses Deep\\"<br />'Here It is\\"<br />\\"Love Itself\\"<br />\\"By The River's Dark\\"<br />\\"You Have Loved Enough\\"<br />\\"Boogie Street\\"<br /><br />They are some of the best song-poems ever written by Leonard (or anybody else).<br />Just lend them your ears, your heart will follow.

0688163173|3.0|To keep is short, the reason why I think this book is just ok is because, although you do keep wondering what's going to happen next, there is never a point where you feel connected to the characters to the point where you care. Because you never start to care about the characters, you continue reading simply to find out what happens in the plot, and not about what happens to the characters themselves. This is an ok book and you shouldn't completely disregard it, but it could've been a lot better in regards to character development.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Is it me or does the intro music to superman movies just kick butt or what? well anyway this movie surely lived up to all the hype and the years of antipication of wating for the superman series to continue. <br />by the way for all those fans who were wondering if Brandon Routh can handle this role who could have played it any better.The style he brought to this role remind you so much of how Chistopher Reeve acted in the older movies. i am so glad the casting crew went searching for an unknown actor. it really made this movie a winner well anyway great movie buy the dvd special ed. because i've already got my copy on the way!!!
B000KI6286|2.0|The trailer looked like this movie had a ton of opportunity with such morally bankrupt characters for a serious laugh, hypocrisy and deep questions, but the script isn't all that good. The acting is fine (except for the kid who just doesn't sound like a kid) and strangely Rob Lowe's character is the most interesting one in the whole movie. I was too disappointed to enjoy it.
B0000E1WKE|3.0|This CD is not all bad, but definately not what Whitney is (or was) capable of.  As far as technical singing technique goes, her breathing is ALL OVER THE PLACE and has little to no control, whereas on her previous efforts she sang and breathed effortlessly.  As far as her delivery/interpretations of the songs, they are somewhat oversung and the arrangements could be better, particularly on \\"O Come O Come..\\".  The last two tracks are probably the best, which goes to tell you that you are MUCH better off getting \\"the Preacher's wife\\" soundtrack instead, where Whitney is at her best.
B000J10EQU|3.0|Anyone who has seen the first two X-men movies was probably excited to hear Bryan Singer was directing Superman Returns.  In those movies he balanced the human (mutant?) element of the characters with a fair amount of external conflict with Magento and co.  One would think that he could take that formula over to the Man of Steel and make an equally good movie.  Not so.  The result presents Superman at his most vulnerable - which is not a bad thing - but Singer gives us a bit too much of it. <br /> <br />Superman returns takes place after the events of Superman II.  Superman returns to earth after taking a 5 year hiatus to go visit Krypton.  What happened during those 5 years is never explained clearly in the film.  This causes it to be more than mildly frustrating when we hear that this is the reason that Lex Luthor got off the hook because Supes couldn't make his court date and that we see a confounded Lois Lane, played by a horribly miscast Kate Bosworth, who has moved on from Superman.  Throughout the film, Superman is trying patch up this relationship.  Singer spends a good amount of the movie showing that Superman is not very good at this. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, there is some action in it.  Superman's first act of goodwill on his return involves stopping an air plane from crash landing.  Then there is a good montage of Superman going around helping people and then there is a finale with Luthor which kind of ends with a wimper.  The Luthor/Superman conflict is handled very poorly.  Though props to Kevin Spacey who has the part down really well. <br /> <br />In defense of Singer, his biggest crime is not giving a good balance of the human/vulnerable Superman and the Superman who is the greatest superhero in the world.  Singer may have felt that viewers had enough of that and gave more attention to the humanity of Superman. That we see that side of Superman is not a bad thing.  There is too much of it and it never seems to get fully resolved.  Of course there willbe sequels and it can be wrapped up there, but for an audience that is gearing up to have Superman back in their lives, this was not the right time to display so much of it.   <br /> <br />The film is laced with emotion, which Singer and co are good at, but it's too much too soon for the revived franchise.  The world needs a savior, yes, but not a guy who can't get his personal life straightened out.
0333581075|2.0|For what it is, and when it was written, this is not a bad book at all.  However, I think by today's standards it's a bit of a let down.

Mr McCloskey was such a great author and this story is such a timeless classic and will continually to be loved by generations of kids to come. A mother duck is helping her ducklings through dangerous situations and its such a great read for children. I highly recommend this book.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|If you're looking for a feast this holiday season that's not just for your stomach but for your ears as well, Sarah McLachlan is certain to steal your heart and satisfy your appetite with her new Christmas album, Wintersong. From the opening track, the John Lennon/Yoko Ono peace anthem \\"Happy Xmas/War Is Over,\\" which is complete with The Sarah McLachlan Outreach Children's Choir and Youth Choir, this rendition ranks closely to Lennon and Ono's original 1971 musical masterpiece. McLachlan also offers up a few traditional songs such as \\"What Child Is This? (Greensleeves),\\" \\"Silent Night\\" and \\"In The Bleak Mid-Winter\\" with such clarity and beauty, that it may make you want to play this disc well after you've taken down your tree and stored your ornaments for next season. If ever there were any reservations that Sarah McLachlan was a Joni Mitchell fan, those doubts are erased with her splendid interpretation of the 1971 evergreen \\"River,\\" which sprouted from the famous Blue album. This song is sung so exquisitely, Mitchell herself has to be beaming that one of her treasures is touched upon with such reverence. The title track is the only original song written by McLachlan that's included, and slips in as seamlessly as the tried and true, like a hand to a winter's glove. It's as inviting as the classics that were written decades before, and gives even more warmth to an album that's as cozy as the fire you've built on the eve before Christmas. The holidays are full of delicious treats, and many of them are the contemporary selections such as the wartime tour de force \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas,\\" which has always resonated with many as a tribute to a family member or loved one that's been away and is sorely missed. It's a lovely but lonely chestnut, and Sarah never loses sight with her sense of hope and longing. It's truly a highlight among highlights.  \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" is a song that will always be identified with the late, great Judy Garland and Sarah presents us with a special serving that makes it her own without straying away from the original sentiment. It's clear that Sarah has an affinity for her fellow Canuck's, as she sang so beautifully on the aforementioned Joni Mitchell sonata and she does on Gordon Lightfoot's 70's classic \\"Songs For A Winter Night,\\" which is sung with such delicate perfection it's almost as if she was auditioning for the veteran songwriter himself. Out of the dozen tracks, number twelve is worth the price of this album alone - \\"Christmas Time Is Here,\\" which was made famous in 1965 as it was introduced to an international audience in A Charlie Brown Christmas, is hands down one of my very favorite Christmas songs of all-time. This song, and Sarah's rendition, brought chills to my body and tears to my eyes. McLachlan is gorgeously accompanied on piano by her friend, the fabulously talented Diana Krall. The sentiment that runs throughout the final cut is \\"Beauty Everywhere.\\" That's an understatement that could sum up this entire album.Sarah presents us with a special serving that makes it her own without straying away from the original sentiment.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|The Beatles new album Love, which stems from the hit Cirque du Soleil Las Vegas extravaganza of the same name, is out of this world. If you think you've heard everything there is to hear from the Beatles, think again. This remix project, that's been subtitled a mash-up of the Fab Four's music, is just that. More than one hundred of their songs have been mashed up into twenty-six tracks clocking in at seventy-eight minutes. Originally, the idea of doing something similar to this came from George Harrison a few years before his untimely death in November 2001. In the mid-90's, he became fast friends with Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Lalibert&eacute; and the two of them had discussed a visual production set to the Beatles' music. Unfortunately, it wasn't until a year after Harrison's death that Lalibert&eacute; put his head together with the Beatles' producer George Martin, and the ideas started to flow. The thought of this production was so exciting it actually brought Martin out of a decade-long retirement. Martin recruited his son, Giles Martin, a record producer in his own right, and together they worked diligently for over two years to create the most exciting \\"new\\" Beatles album since the entire band last laid down tracks in 1969.  All in all, the 26 cuts on this collection is one trip back to the psychedelic age of the late 1960's but carries a sound that is as pristine as any new recording is for 2006. The album kicks off with an a cappella rendition of \\"Because\\" taken from the Abbey Road set. From there the journey turns into a trip that makes the Magical Mystery Tour seem dated. \\"Get Back\\" is treated to an introduction that begins with the familiar one-chord opening of \\"A Hard Days Night\\" which then is mixed seamlessly into the White Album gem \\"Glass Onion,\\" all the while sampling \\"Hello, Goodbye\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever.\\" Speaking of Lennon's \\"Strawberry\\" masterpiece, that particular track is one of the many highlights among highlights, as the Martin's chose an alternate take that will take your breath away. The track \\"Yesterday\\" was tricky because it may be the one song that George and Giles thought might be overplayed and not welcome. What to do? What they did was an ingenious thirty-second introduction of \\"Blackbird\\" before hearing Paul's vocal on the first notes of the aforementioned landmark recording. Problem solved, beautifully. Other tracks that literally gave me goosebumps were Harrison's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (which was superbly remixed with a new string arrangement by the elder Martin that adds a certain vulnerability to the classic) and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" (which also samples Lennon's \\"Julia\\"), while \\"Something\\" transitioned into \\"Blue Jay Way\\" which melts into the next track, \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite,\\" which blew me away. \\"Octopus's Garden,\\" which sampled \\"Sun King\\" in its delivery, was sublime. Speaking of \\"Sun King,\\" you may notice that track #8 is one you don't recognize by name, but you'll recognize the sound. Its title is \\"Gnik Nus,\\" which is actually the anagram for \\"Sun King.\\" Giles turned the cymbal backwards on \\"King\\" and in turn also reversed the vocals for a fabulous innovative reinvention of the composition. I could list all twenty-six tracks and tell you how very unique each one is, but I'm afraid I would have to write three parts of this review to fully explain the genius of this entire album. The Beatles changed the course of pop music. This album respectfully extends their legacy. And in the end, like the last song says, \\"All You Need Is Love.\\"<br /><br />Footnote: If you want the full experience of Love, I implore you to purchase the special edition that includes the audio DVD disc. The sound on this 5.1 DVD is so extraordinary that you'll hear these songs like you've never heard them before. The slightest instrument and vocals come alive as if they never before existed.

B000GIWS7E|5.0|With each new live DVD from DT I have wondered how they can maintain the momentum, excitement and interest. This brief review outlines why I believe that 'Score' matches 'Live in Budokan' in excellence and excitement.<br /><br />Live in Budokan' is one of my top 5 live rock DVDs in a collection of over 40 concert DVDs. (See my review 'Brilliant concert and certainly a Mike Portnoy showcase') 'Score' is immediatley added to my top 5 DVD concerts. Not only is the sound and video quality the same but the players show new aspects to their vast range of musical skills. Portnoy adds fills in places that other mortal drummers just smile, whilst Petrucci shows a melodic side not as apparent in 'Live in Budokan' which tended towards being a shredfest. Some of the soloing over the orchestra and band in the second set was majestic progressive rock at its best - so beautiful that I found it an emotional experience.<br /><br />The 'Six degrees of inner turbulence' composition is covered in its entirety. This alone is worthy of an accolade. The controversial set list is great in that it covers material not already covered on previous DT DVD concerts. I find this thoughtful of the band rather than overplaying some classics to death. (I think of all the Deep Purple DVD concerts with 'Smoke on the water' played without fail.)<br /><br />Radio City Music Hall, NY, was the perfect venue and of course we have the addition of the 'Octavarium' orchestra. Before purchasing I wondered how this would work and hesitated thinking of some wishy-washy soft version with an orchestra. I was impressed how well this worked - in no way do DT play quietly - there is no compromise. DT rock as hard as ever. The orchestra complement and add to the power and beauty of the arrangements.<br /><br />Any weaknesses? If anything the orchestra by themselves in the overture did not seem as cohesive or as sure of the score. Certainly the playing worked better together with the band. I am sure this would have been stretching for both orchestra members and DT. A real achievement that this worked so well.<br /><br />Yes, there is a dead spot in the DVD - and my heart missed a beat. But really in the bigger scheme of things, so what. 3 hours plus of material and you have a 1 second pause.<br /><br />There is no hesitation in giving this DVD top score (pardon the pun!)<br /><br />DT fans will have bought this already. For newcomers - where have you been for the last 20 years? This will be an excellent addition to anyone's collection who loves progressive rock with a hard edge. Uncompromising musicianship that will enthrall for the entire concert and then again and again...members and DT. A real achievement that this worked so well.

B00007LTIG|3.0|This is actually a pretty good album and it includes some fun early stuff. The songs are not as good as they would come up with later but it does give a good clue as to what the band was doing at that point in their career. Most of the songs on the album were covers. One of the songs - The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion) has been a fan favorite for years. This was also before Robert Hunter came back into the scene to write the lyrics. The new bonus tracks are very good and a nice listen.

B0000C23DO|3.0|This was meant for people starting out Grateful Dead collections, I guess. All but one song on this album is from the studio recordings. For me, the main problem with this release is that there are no jam or even live selections aside from One More Saturday Night. At a time when there are more live releases than studio albums, it seems a shame to completely bypass this stuff. So many of the Dead's signature songs are also not included. No Terrapin Station, no Playing In The Band, no Jack Straw, no Scarlet Begonias, no Deal and so on. This should've been a two cd set and it could've been more inclusive.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|it appears that some people are just simply stuck on the nostalgia, and are not being very objective about the film itself. I, myself, am one of the BIGGEST superman fans around, and even I can see where this was going.<br /><br />First of all, we never needed the Paris segment to explain how the Kryptonian Villains were released. It's really a long, drawn out piece that is lame in comparison to Donner's idea, and takes up way too much time in the original film. It makes way more sense to use the nukes that Superman eliminated in part 1, as it gives part 2 more continuity with the first film. Let us keep in mind that Mario Puzo (Godfather trilogy) wrote a very lengthy script that included parts 1 and 2. Donner simply wanted to shoot Puzo's adaptation of his entire story. That's why both films were shot simultaneously.<br /><br />Secondly, I always found it lame how Lois discovered that Clark was Superman. the whole hand in the fire thing was very contrived and just plain silly. It made more sense that Lois would use her cleverness and reporter savvy to trip up Clark into admitting who he really was. (it is sad that only the rehersal footage was available for this part of the film). I found it to be much more meaningful and true to both the Clark and Lois characters. Also, I've always thought that the \\"Lois jumping into the water, trying to drown\\" bit was also lame. Once again, my friends, it is more likely that the character of Lois Lane would more likely jump from the office window rather than try to drown herself at Niagra Falls.<br /><br />Thirdly, I liked the fact that they extracted some of the silly humor parts. i.e. the \\"Non trying to cook the snake with heat vision\\" gag, the \\"Non giving the red police globe to Zod as some kind of gift\\" gag, and the absolutely stupid Clark kissing Lois and sucking out her memory\\" gag. Again, it makes MORE SENSE that 'ol Sup did the \\"turn time back\\" routine to fix all that had gone wrong and to protect his identity (yet another continuity point with the first film). For those of you who didn't pay attention to the \\"restoring the vision\\" doc, the filmakers said that it was their feeling that Clark doesn't get to kiss Lois...only Superman gets to do that.-again...makes sense!<br /><br />Also,as a policy, I never take any reviews seriously where the reviewer can't even spell his/her words correctly. It causes me to question their intelligence in general, and I see this a lot on Amazon. I originally saw these films as a child, and look back on them with fondness and nostalgia as most of you do. However, not only am I a true fan of the Superman books and the characters in them, but I'm also a fan of great movies. If you know anything at all about making or watching great movies, it's that staying as true to the continuity and originality of the source material as possible is paramount. Besides, how the hell could you possibly object to the restored Marlon Brando (Jor-El) footage?<br /><br />It's time for all of us to be more objective to the film and to the source material. The painful truth is, is that the expanded (2000) version of part 1 and the Donner cut of part 2 is the truest and most honest example of Puzo's work as a whole. Sorry if some of you don't see that. Don't be so caught up in how it was \\"back in the day\\". Don't get me wrong,  I love the old films, but hell, if there's a better, more complete version out there, let me at it!<br /><br />Some last thoughts: one reviewer mentioned that it made no sense that the dispatched nukes provided the escape for the Villains; as there was quite some time between the two films' timelines. My response is DUH!!! The first film showed Clark growing up, moving to metropolis, getting a job, and eventually becoming the man of steel. There's quite a lot of time involved here. Yes, quite enough time to pass between the events in the two films, so that argument makes NO sense whatsoever.<br /><br />Take a look at the film as a whole, and you'll seewhat I'm talking about. Enjoy this long awaited event!, and you'll see what I'm talking about. Enjoy this long awaited event!
B000AP04FG|1.0|Be sure to have paramedics standing by when you watch this movie, because by its end, your viewing environment will have been converted into a near vacuum which will leave you gasping for oxygen. <br /> <br />To paraphrase my opening statement,....This movie sucks!  The so called comedy was below my humor threshold.  It was too predictable, and some of the so called action scenes were just too unbelievable.  You would be better off watching a TV \\"test pattern.\\" <br /> <br />I've seen both Brad and Angelina in better movies.  This, however, is one vehicle that should be recalled.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|This is a very good movie and if you loved the Lester version you definately need to see it.  However i do not feel it is a better film that the Lester version.  The word is that Donner only got to shoot about 70% of his version of 2.  So had he been allowed to shoot his other 30% some of the problems that i have with this version might have been cleared up.  Spoilers coming so be forewarned.  In the Donner cut the 3 villains actually escape from the phantom zone as a result of one of the missles that Superman hurled into space at the end of Superman the movie.  It is a good opening to the film however what had to be sacrificed was one of my favorite Superman movie moments ever.  In Lesters version when Clark finds out about Lois being at the Eifel tower and the bomb he races off to that back alley turns in to Superman and flies off to save her.  I love that moment always have.  Since in Lesters version the bomb at the Eifel tower is what frees the villains it had to be cut though.  There are all sorts of changes in terms of how Lois finds out about Clark being Superman, some good some bad.  The good is a scene where she literally throws herself out a window so confidant that Clark is Superman and he will save her.  The bad is a scene where she fires a gun at him as a means of trying to get him to reveal himself.  The scene was very well written but they had to use the test screenings for Reeve and Kidder because Donner did not actually get to shoot that scene.  Donner blended in the 2 test screening shot far very apart as one big scene.  You see Reeve going through radical physical changes in the scene, he has long hair, then short, he is buff then skinny it is very distracting.  The biggest changes are that all the Brando Jor-EL footage was restored to the film.  The producers cut it all out of Lesters version to avoid paying Brando his huge fee of about 3 mil i heard.  Most of the scenes with Reeve and Brando are great especially when he goes back to the fortressto reclaim his powers.  However i did miss the scenes in Lesters version with his mother Lara, played wonderfully by Susannah York.  I thought in Lesters version when he is telling his mother of his feelings for Lois it came off as more believable.  In the Donner cut it is more of an angry defiant exchange between father and son, i did not feel it played as well.  The end is the same as Superman 1, in that he turns back time to make Lois forget about what happened.  Supposedly that was the orginal ending to 2 all along but they changed it to the ending in 1 at the last minute.  I personally feel that if you could combine all the elements of the 2 versions you would have the best superhero movie ever on your hands.  So basically i feel if you loved the Lester version it is a must see but i do not feel it is a better film.
0790740443|2.0|I can't really bring myself to either like or dislike this movie entirely.  Another entry in the \\"future troopers\\" genre, it uses science fiction to explore the notion of a fierce, unstoppable, but ultimately disposable form of combat soldier.  Examples of this notion have ranged from the excellent (Blade Runner, Robocop and the Terminator) to the awful (Universal Soldiers).  This one's okay.    On first viewing, it reminds me of a larger-budget version of Enemy Mine, in which we get barely a glimpse of a war-torn future before the hero is dumped on a barely habitable planet, struggles for survival, and ends up in your basic action climax.  Like Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, Jr. in that movie, Kurt Russell gives a performance better than his material deserves -- which isn't saying much, since a lot of Soldier plays like it was written for Stallone at the height of his Rambo misanthropy.    The cast is generally good, particularly Russell's finely understated performance -- his character's lifelong conditioning has made him incapable of expressing emotion, or even speaking conversationally (he robotically addresses everyone but the enemy as \\"sir\\"), yet he conveys enough in his body language to make more of his role than one might expect.      Another reviewer called this a sequel to Blade Runner and compared Russell's Sgt. Todd to BR's Deckard.  Without arguing too much, I'd modify that by saying it's more of a Blade Runner prequel (thematically, if not literally).  It's essentially the backstory of Blade Runner's Roy Batty, an enhanced combat soldier bred for offworld service but never regarded as truly human, who rebels against his shortsighted human masters and leads his followers to a prospective home on another world.  Of course, Todd's stoic efficiency bears little resemblance to Batty's charismatic dark angel persona, but they're flipsides of the same coin.  (The fact that both films were written by the same screenwriter becomes clear long before the creditsroll -- listen for the \\"Tanhauser Gate\\" reference.)    Soldier isn't a great movie by any stretch.  If anything, it has the feel of a script written back in the 80's that had gathered dust on a shelf until someone felt like filming it.  Take it on that level, and it's watchable.  Not great, but good enough to pass a little time.
B000IY03CS|5.0|When an artist releases a 'best of' it's normally signalling the beginning of the end of a (succesfull) career. Not for this sometimes controversial, but always non-conformalist artist. Having said that, I'm a bit confused why George Michael released an album that for two thirds consists of previously released material, when the new songs warrant an album of their own! But I guess that's what signing a contract with a record company does for you... <br /> <br />Generally, I need some time to warm to George Michaels new songs when I hear them for the first time (I remember hearing 'Faith' for the first time thinking \\"what the...\\").  Adding to that, the new material is pretty self evident and, let's say... private? George Michael is finally in tune with his sexuality and not afraid to make it a subject of mostly every new song. Though that takes some getting used to from a heterosexual point of view, the stories are genuine and lovingly sung - something to be applauded from wherever point of view you look at it.  <br /> <br />Again, George Michael surprises with me with songs that I can't seem to stop playing over and over (particularly the new ones). The music transcends itself combined with the fantastic voice of George Michael. About that voice... It always amazes me how well it combines with uptune disco songs like 'Too Funky' or 'Freek' as well as more sedate tunes like the unique jazzy cover of 'Roxanne' or new material like 'My mother had a brother'.  <br /> <br />I find it really wonderful experiencing George Michael releasing this kind of timeless music. And if necessary, don't mind waiting a couple of years for his next album.
0375704027|2.0|I gave this 2 stars simply because it kept me reading, and I think Murakami is a good writer in that he can string sentences together well and keep things moving and interesting enough that you don't chuck the book across the room at the wall in utter boredom.  Really I'd like to give it 2.5 stars though.<br /><br />It's missing 3 stars because this book had me laughing in incredulity half the time, and left me at the end with both a sort of slimy, need-a-shower feeling, as well as a \\"huh?!\\" sort of feeling of total pointlessness. I got about 3/4 of the way through the book before I realized, no, it's not actually going to suddenly change directions and get a point or depth.<br /><br />Perhaps it's that I'm not very clued up on Japanese culture, perhaps the translation really is a bad one, as at least one other reviewer thought, but I feel like if there was a point, I completely missed it. This next bit contains some minor SPOILERS, so be forewarned... To me it was a random succession of inexplicable, sudden, almost porn-movie-esque bowchickabowbow simply-for-titillation one-night-stand sex scenes and entirely too many suicides to make ANY sense.  It got to a point where I felt like he was just throwing in cheap plot thrills of sex and death to keep a really pointless look at a self-absorbed college kid's life going to the wimpy end, and in the end, the number of cheap plot thrills he resorted to was pretty laughable.<br /><br />On a positive note - the characters are quirky in a pretty believable way, and I liked Midori's character especially, although I felt like their romance had a sort of strange pace to it, like it all sort of came to a head rather over suddenly.  The book is not totally lacking in depth - there are some interesting thoughts on triangles and relationships between people that suffer or improve because of the presence of a third person.  Some of it strove for depth though and just sort of fell short and just seemed pretentious, to me.  I wish I felt more for any of the characters - I didn't really like or care about any of them, which I think was my main problem - I couldn't identify, really.  There was either too much vulnerability (Naoko) or too little (Toru, who, I'm sorry to say, just seemed like an unfeeling oaf who plodded his way through whatever life handed him).<br /><br />In general I feel a bit undecided about Murakami.  I think he's a very good writer in a way - everything was well described, so you do get absorbed into the setting, and can see everything clearly as he describes it, and I must admit, it did keep me reading, but the plot itself just seemed to be pretty lackluster and full of sudden, unrealistic dramatic plot devices that just were too frequent and unsupported to really make it believable or worthy of much thought or praise.
B000H7JCG4|2.0|I once sold the entire first season on VHS on ebay when I was 13.  The quality was better, my tapes had the original music, and werent missing any scenes.  If that knowledge doesn't bother you then run out and buy these dvds.  If you really want to collect the show...start setting your tivos on FX.  another question...what is going to happen in season 3. I flat out will not watch brenda crying over dylan without losing my religion. i will not watch ditch day without color me badd or the finale without blood is thicker than water. they seriously need to do something about this because at some point (if i admit that it doesn't matter now) the music is really going to make a huge difference.
B000J10ERO|2.0|Superman is one of the best superheroes of all time. So most fans were awaiting a return, right. Yes. But Superman didn't need to return with this film. Before you buy or rent this film, you must know it is one of the weakest comic book based film I have seen. It is not as bad as Fantastic Four, and it doesn't even come close, but it does not give superman justice.<br /><br />  Superman fans were excited when they heard the director's name: Bryan Singer, the one who spawned the first two X-Men films. This film bombed based on expectations. With a budget of around $215,000,000, it only grossed $200,000,000. It lacked the $15,000,000, which dropped the budget for the follow-up to $175,000,000. You might ask, why did it kind of bomb?<br /><br />  The storyline is spectacular. Superman returns after five years to see Lois Lane with a child and engaged, writing articles for The Daily Planet, bashing Superman. It also involves Lex Luthor trying to take over the world once again, only this time he is trying to wipe out the United States to make a new continent. The film starts off very slow, and the first seven minutes is just credits alone. Then it becomes cliched in superhero films. The film only has three major action scenes: the plane crash, the bank robery/car antics, and the world taker over, the last thirty some odd minutes of the film.<br /><br />  The film is gorgeous, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't have the heart that Superman has. Brandon Routh is an excellent Superman, yet Kate Bosworth is a heartless, boring Lois Lane. Kevin Spacey is a fun, just fun, Lex Luthor, but he is not that evil. Parker Posey plays Lex Luthor's femal sidekick, adding humor that was actually funny.<br /><br />  The film is promising during the action sequences, but it becomes boring when Superman and Lois Lane are having their \\"Why did you leave\\" romantic moments. THe only shocking thing about Superman Returns's plot is (SPOILER WARNING---SKIP THE REST OF THE PARAGRAPH IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO FIND OUT!!!) Superman has a son, Lois Lane's son, which it is obvious from the second time you meet the child.<br /><br />  I thought Superman Returns was going to be a fun superhero adventure, like Spider-Man 2, yet it falls short to be a mediocre cry for a return of Superman. The film didn't have the heart it needed to succeed. It is gorgeous, and if it were a film about nothing, it would deserve an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, but it is a film about Superman, a boring film at that.NT TO FIND OUT!!!)

B00005JPCA|5.0|Yes, I miss Pierce Brosnan as James Bond...just to get that out of the way. But, even with Brosnan gone, I wasn't really too concerned that they were gonna bollocks the 007 franchise up too badly. I'd just seen LAYER CAKE and had been quite impressed with Daniel Craig's dynamic performance. So I knew I was in for a good time with CASINO ROYALE. This version - not to be confused with the wacky 1967 version with David Niven and Peter Sellers - is James Bond as Ian Fleming had written him in the novels, stripped bare of those cute cinematic touches. James Bond here is a cold and arrogant killer who hasn't yet perfected that veneer of wit and sophistication.<br /><br />Here come the crazy SPOILERS: CASINO ROYALE tells of the genesis of James Bond as Daniel Craig takes 007 back to his early days of having just been elevated to 007 status. Instead of the suave operator we're used to, what we glimpse is a raw, thuggish secret agent, whose clumsy modus operandi is \\"let's poke the bear and see what happens.\\" This is never more typified than in two sequences in the film: during a thrilling, expanded chase thru a construction site where the grace and athleticism of Bond's target is contrasted with Bond's bull-in-a-china-shop methods of pursuit and, much later, in the casino, wherein Bond, fearing that he'd run out of options, prepares to crudely knife down his victim. Now, even in his later film exploits, Bond never really strays too far from his penchant for \\"poking the bear,\\" but he does become more refined about it. It's interesting to note that, at that time of his career, even though he was already a cold-blooded killer, one particularly brutal, life-or-death struggle on a flight of stairs still was able to unnerve him, post-encounter.<br /><br />It's also worth mentioning that James Bond doesn't toss out a lot of one-liners here, although he does offer up a memorable barb after a failed attempt to give him a cardiac arrest. But, mostly, Bond keeps his mouth shut and his eyes open as he...learns to mold himself into his later, more dashing incarnation. In this movie, you could practically see the wheels of origin inexorably turn. We witness the evolution of various 007 fixtures, ie: his experimentation with the martini drink, his presumably first run-in with an Aston-Martin, his first meeting with CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), his first utterance of \\"Bond...James Bond,\\" and his seemingly debonair but ultimately callous handling of women. Alas, we have no Q present and a bare minimum of cool gadgets, but Dame Judi Dench is here as M, which actually sets up a paradox because, in later films, Judi Dench now has to replace herself as the new M (in GOLDENEYE, chronologically). But that's just quibbling.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is a great and virile James Bond. He's got a presence that is very physical, intense, and commanding. The charm of Bond here doesn't come from urbane elegance and clever wordplay as much as from a wellspring of animalistic vitality. And, as ably proven in LAYER CAKE, the guy can act. Throughout the film, there's a sense of pent-up energy emanating from Craig, as if, at any moment, he could explode in a miasma of action. Also, his craggy face and his icy blue eyes lend him credibility as a straight-up killer. In a negative way, Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore's pretty, good looks placed them too high up in  fantasy world, their exploits admired from afar but difficult to relate with. Craig, who's blessed with a rugged, blunt handsomeness but isn't too good-looking to piss a guy off, has a better chance here to come across as more \\"real.\\" In the self-assuredness that he wears like a cloak, Craig borrows from Sean Connery. In muscular physique and physicality, he's closer to former male model turned actor George Lazenby (ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE). In fact, CASINO ROYALE and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE also share one other thing in common besides the two leads' pumped up brawn: they are the only two films where Commander Bond has truly fallen in love.<br /><br />The plot of the movie, if looked into too closely, is boring. Roughly, it involves Bond, as his first 007 mission, having to beat a terrorist broker at cards in a high stakes casino tournament so that the prize money isn't used to fund terrorist activities. The film benefits from a slam-bang opening sequence, then the opening credits, followed immediately by another excellent action sequence. Afterwards, the pace  becomes leisurely and, with the advent of the casino scenes, decidedly  becomes even more leisurely. But, don't fret; here and there, the movie throws enough cinematic bones to keep the viewer contentedly glued to the screen. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd is smoking hot but seems to lack the same sensuality she showcased in DREAMERS. But there's decent chemistry between her and Craig. Mads Mikkelsen is perfectly adequte, if routine, as Le Chiffre, the main baddie who weeps in blood and has a gambling jones. But, naturally, Daniel Craig is head and shoulders and biceps and pecs above everyone else. And, as a sidenote, he really sells that torture scene. Ouchie.<br /><br />With only his first outing, Craig seems to have already cemented his place in the 007 pantheon. I hate to say this but Craig just might be the 2nd best Bond ever, after Sean Connery, of course. Unfortunately, this drops Brosnan, who I really like as an actor, to third place. Hopefully, Craig will keep up the quality with the inevitable sequels. But, for now, so long, Pierce Brosnan. And, welcome, Craig...Daniel Craig.o films where Commander Bond has truly fallen in love.<br /><br />The plot of the movie, if looked into too closely, is boring.

B000A2XC1C|1.0|In the history of bad movies, this one sets new standards.  In the middle of the movie I remember thinking, \\"Please God, Make it Stop.\\"  The actor who plays Joe evokes a visceral response in the viewer bordering on homicidal rage.  Better casting could have been done by simply picking random people in Central Park.  The only redeeming acting is done by John Lithgow who is so evil on screen, that he is actually endearing.  There should have been more of him and less of everyone else.  I did survive this movie, but it has left an indelible scar on my soul.  Please God, end my agony  -- stop the movie or just kill me.

0743289412|1.0|I have always been a Stephen King fan. I read all of his early books--The Stand, The Shining, Christine, The Dead Zone, Carrie, and so on. I think the most recent book of his that I have read is IT. <br /> <br />I gave this book one star because there's not a rating of \\"no stars.\\" This book bears no resemblance to the Stephen King I grew up reading. I was interested in reading this one because I'm a horror writer and it looked like it would be an insightful story. And I was curious to find out what a \\"bool\\" was. <br />Thank God I checked it out from the library instead of buying it. I can't decide if it's worse than The Da Vinci Code (IMO the WORST drivel ever written) or not.  <br />It's unreadable. I've read through the reviews here and many people have said that after you slog through the first part of it, it's great. How do you do that? I was completely unable to get past the first part, and I certainly tried HARD.  <br />This book reads as if SK got drunk and decided to try to write plastered at 3:00am. \\"Lisey\\" rambles incoherently. It was very confusing. And I agree with whoever said that the famous writer in the story was over the top. Give me a break. Everytime Lisey flashes back to some event she and Scott attended, it's like Jesus came to town. Ridiculous. And the language...geez. Someone pointed out that all marriages have their own terminology that is intimate to them. Of course they do. But it makes no sense to OTHERS, and that is the case here.  <br /> <br />If you must read this book, I highly recommend you check it out at the library. Hint: of course the request list will be long. Ask for the \\"large print\\" version. There won't be a waiting list for that copy.  <br /> <br />Someone else said that if she had read this without knowing it was a Stephen King book, she never would have known he wrote it. That's how I felt, and not in a good way. It has a \\"fake\\" feel to it, as though SK is trying to imitate another writer. <br /> <br />If this is all SK hasleft to offer now, he needs to rest on his huge pile of money, er, that is, laurels.
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist (the original) is one of the scariest movies ever produced. It's as scary today as when I watched it all those years ago.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Regarding the concept: As a Beatles completist and purist, I was a bit hesitant about this concept but after listening I was blown away like many other reviewers. The George Martin string arrangement on While My Guitar Gently Weeps gives a wonderful new life to the song. It's also great to hear this earlier George vocal take with a different verse. \\"I look from the wings at the play you are staging - while my guitar gently weeps. As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging - still my guitar gently weeps.\\" <br /> <br />Regarding the mash-up: For those potential buyers fearing a giant mixed-up hodge podge of unrecognizable songs, this is not the case. All the mixes are well done and creative. Also, some songs are more \\"mixed\\" than others. Several songs sound about 80 percent unchanged other than the lead-in and lead-out. There is one notable difference though - greatly improved sound resolution... <br /> <br />Regarding the sound: The 5.1 is very impressive and should be applied to the entire catalog. I recalibrated my speaker balance to fully enjoy the DVD. Here is the amazing thing though: the regular CD audio is more crisp and clear than ever. I've listened to all these songs on CD in my car before - but today I heard clearer more dynamic sounds than I have ever heard! I'm glad to know the potential is there to draw out this level of fidelity from all the songs. Giles Martin states in the liner notes that expected the EMI tapes to have hisses and crackles but the engineers recorded the Beatles so well the tapes sounded as if they were \\"frozen in time... as if it they were recorded yesterday.\\" <br /> <br />Beatles fans who apprehensive about \\"tampering\\" - have no fear! Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream!

0385509456|5.0|I am an adult who has been diagnosed with AS (Asperger's Syndrome) which is a mild form of autism.  I loved this novel and it was recommended by others for me to read it.  It's really amazing how many characteristics are almost (but uniquely) identical to those of us with ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorders).  There are quite a few books written about people with lower functioning ASD and savant, but never have I read a novel about a person with HFA or AS.  I think it's a great way to slowly but give the world a perspective from the eyes of a person with ASD.  I am fortunate that I have completed college, got my degree and i'm a teacher who works with students with moderate-severe autism as well.  I think if my parents wouldn't have allowed me to make mistakes or learn through trial and error, I'd probably be beyond a recluse.  Thanks Mr. Haddon for your wonderful novel.  I hope it's used in schools as good literature too.   <br />Troy in Downey, Ca <br />AspieTeacher
B000A2RRF4|4.0|The 1992 HBO concert (and frequent subsequent VH1 staple) finally comes to DVD, available by itself for the first time (and just in the nick of time for those of us still viewing our 15 year-old VHS tapes, that probably have more glitches and grain on them than any self-respecting fan would ever deal with).  Time has not been too kind to this show (unlike the album the concert supports, which I hadn't come to truly appreciate until recent years - it, I think, was ahead of its time -  this show feel somewhat dated), but it still boasts a large number of standout performances and several of Jackson's awe-inspiring moves.  The setlist is great (though you almost wish there were more hits represented; however to fit all of MJ's hits in one show, the guy would have to be on stage for 5 hours), so is the dancing and the theatrics.  Less than stellar is the lip-synching on many songs (although given his huff-and-puff performance of \\"Billie Jean,\\" maybe lip-synching is necessary for some performers) and endless shots of crying, fainting fans (although, if you could make 20 people per show do that, I bet you'd make a point of showing it off on your DVD). <br /> <br />This is the only Michael Jackson live DVD available.  Simply to have a document of why he is considered to be the ultimate performer is reason enough to say this is a must addition to any true rock `n roll library.  However, it is flawed in some respects and much of the shenanigans feel dated.  A too-bass-heavy sound mix doesn't help.  But Jackson's solo spotlight dance on \\"Billie Jean\\" (vocal performance aside) is reason all by itself to own this baby.  \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is also a performance highlight. <br /> <br />If you plan to pick this one up, do yourself a favor and, instead of spending 15 to 20 bucks on this, pay up another 10 or 15 and grab \\"The Ultimate\\" box set from two years ago.  This DVD is included there along with four other CD's of Jackson hits, B-Sides, and Jackson 5/Jackson era jams.  It is simply the better buy, especially since it now sells for about $30 at Best Buy (last week they had it on sale for $20). <br /> <br />I see people here at Amazon are fairly divided on this release, as they seem to be about Jackson himself.  However, most agree he is still a mesmerizing performer and just can't help but watch him perform.  If this DVD doesn't do it for you, then I recommend both \\"Dangerous:  The Short Films\\" (like the album, this DVD also feels ahead of its time in that it came out originally on VHS back in the early 90s when these type of releases were basically just a bunch of videos, this one has the videos built around all sorts of other stuff:  news footage, award appearances, and has videos you may have never scene on MTV; its like a scrapbook of everything he did during that album's reign - it should be required that any band and their producer watch this before just throwing together a bunch of videos for a DVD compilation) and \\"HIStory on Film:  Volume II,\\" which includes a lot of the best stuff that was already on  the first volume (\\"Thriller,\\" \\"Beat It,\\" etc), but also all the great stuff they left off the first volume (like the full 40-minute \\"Smooth Criminal\\" video, the infamous \\"Billie Jean\\" Motown 25 performance, and newer stuff as recent as that DVDs release in 1997, like \\"Blood on the Dance Floor,\\" which i still say is a great, underrated Jackson track). <br />
B00008NRI8|3.0|The creators of this civil, well-mannered comedy seem to cater to the old cliche of the impossible romantic pairing, but be warned: this is not a story of two opposite forces clashing against each other and, eventually, realizing how much they have always needed to get together. Here we have a rather aggressive lawyer and a rich, decent guy who falls for her. It's as simple and polite as that.  <br /> <br />Bullock's self sufficiency doesn't seem to be needing Grant's decency for a minute. When she finally declares herself to him (he's been lovestruck all the while) it's only because he agreed to give her exactly what she wants. She must be falling as a 'thank you' gesture. Does she seem to really need Grant? The motivational arc seems to imply that she should only because a woman cannot live by herself. <br /> <br />There are other minor problems with this movie. We have a silly scene with a cellphone ringing in the middle of a wedding. The reasons of this are explained verbally in the subsequent scene. But there has been no set-up for the silliness, and the verbal explanation is pat and a cop-out.  <br /> <br />Then we have a lot of scenes where people and cars move into the frame from right-field towards left. This is most annoying and signifying a backward pull in the visual development of the narration. The cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs is greyish and uninvolving. Kovacs is a master, and to be sure he manages to impart a consistently dull color tone to the whole proceedings. It must have been a stylistic requirement, yet the fact that all of the the natural daylight is cloudy doesn't sit well with this kind of stuff. <br /> <br />The director/writer succeeded especially in extracting two believable performances from the stars. \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is pleasant enough. No big laughs, though, just polite smiles.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The overwhelming feeling of doubt that often seems to manifest within us towards political figures is commonplace.  To see a politcal figure truely be passionate about a moral issue is not commonplace enough, thus, its genuinity may be difficult to ascertain for some.       Unfortunatly for me, and surely many others, the things I value and deem as important issues of concern don't ever seem to be supported by the sole policies of either of the mainstreem politcal parties.  Mabye a mixture of the two ideologies, or even a whole new set of gentlemen neatly pampered with make-up would present new, more intriguing approaches as to how to lead our country and how things should be prioritized.      Either way, it would seem logical that the place to start, the initial politcal focal point, is with what would prove to be the biggest current issue at hand and what most affects our well being.  Welp, that would seem be the world's environment and our treatment of it.  The environment is our grounds for survival, and humankind's well being is reliant on its well being.  It is this concept that Gore embraces, and, therefore, he has grabbed the attention of all people alike.  For those who have watched this documentary and have been left only with an image of Al humping a tree, don't be so quick as to forget that issues concerning the environment will in turn affect, in some way, all other issues that concern humankind.  Dismissing him as just another environmentalist will not accomplish much of anything beyond ignorance.      This documentary is surely worth watching! It is very informative, if not interesting at the least.
B000J10ERO|2.0|This has got to be the most Metrosexual of all comic book adaption of Superhero.   So Superman is in rehab for 5 years, finally he comes back, girlfriend Lois, left him,  is now a single mother with a live in boyfriend.  Yes bring a kid to see this movie.     Turns out while he's gone,  Lex breaks into his crib and steals his Prized CD collections, puts one on ebay for alot of money.  Anyway, we don't need to see too much of the softer side of this Superman.  This action movie borderlines cheesy.  Costume is the same as in the 80's version.  At least put a Carbon fiber 'S' on his chest.  Instead of brite red.  How about a dark burgandy, dark blue suite that looks like the current version of Batman.     The people who made Casino Royale should have come in to write and direct this movie and make Superman much tougher and meaner.  Without his power, he couldn't even fight half of Lex Luther.  Lex is twice his age.  perhaps they should cast Daniel Craig as Superman.  Lame movie.  Two Stars....
B00005JPCY|4.0|Director Tony Scott and Denzel Washington's \\"Man on Fire\\" is one of the best films of the last ten years, though it was much neglected when it was released a few years ago. It features a towering performance by Denzel, a much tighter than normal for him directing job by Scott and a thoughtful and heartbreaking story that lingers in the mind long after the final frame flickers away.<br /><br />Now Scott and Denzel have teamed again in \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; vu\\" (literally \\"already seen\\") and though the results are not as dramatic as they are in \\"MOF,\\" it is a strong film due to several factors: Denzel's performance as Federal Agent Doug Carlin(his persona and mere presence on the screen gives anything he does importance and resonance), newcomer Paula Patton as Claire Kuchever (a dead ringer for Hallie Berry and just as talented) and once again Scott's taut and waste-free direction. The problem here is with the story or more to the point the part of the story about going into the past and changing the outcome of an event that hasn't yet occurred. The problem is that it is hokey and we've seen it done a lot better in Spielberg's \\"Minority Report.\\"<br /><br />All that being said, despite the creaky plot conceit, \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; vu\\" is pretty terrific: basically a police/government, find the bad guy (a not the usual for him performance by James Caviziel who brings his patented humanity and kindness to this role and then twists it all up) police procedural drama filmed in gorgeous saturated color.<br /><br />Though \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; vu\\" is not a great film, it is a good one. Come to it with an open heart and mind and you will not be disappointed.
