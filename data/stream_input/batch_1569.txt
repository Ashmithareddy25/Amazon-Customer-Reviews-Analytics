B007VTVGAQ|2.0|I can't figure out what is worse:<br /><br />1. The long-winded, nonsensical title to all of her albums<br /><br />or<br /><br />2. The self-pitying, whining, \\"I'm a victim\\" lyrics that coat her songs like thick paint.<br /><br />Jeez, Fiona...it's been 15 years...get over yourself and stop with the recluse act.<br /><br />Some of her songs showed promise in the early albums, but this is nails on a chalkboard.<br /><br />The age of the female \\"woe-is-me\\" nonsense is over...time to grow up people.<br /><br />The only thing this act is good for is that a bunch of whiny, self-pitying teens will buy it like hotcakes.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Good lord this bluray is beautiful and the only reason I am adding yet another review. You haven't seen this film like this unless you are of age to have been there opening night or somewhere around that time. Maybe not even then. They have cleaned it up and given it the usual Disney gloss but all the detail are there for you to appreciate just how genius these animators and directors and writers were. From the true golden age of Disney film. An absolute Masterpiece in every way possible.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Is what my 9 &amp; 12 year olds said when I asked them what they'd rate this game.  Works great on my kindle fire.  Very clever game and cute graphics.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Paid for ad-free but still have ads.  Also newest update deletes your progress because it requires you to uninstall the old version before installing the new one.
B0051XJ9YE|2.0|Car is noticeably cheaper than the other cars.<br />Some in the cars II series are of poor quality.<br />Petrov especially.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I love it! It has everything I thought it would have and more. I would definitely recommend buying this to any fan of the show or avid watcher of supernatural based shows. It's a must have and I can't wait till season 2 becomes available for pre-order.
0312323867|5.0|I have to agree with many of the reviewers, this was a book I was ready to NOT like, just because I don't care for Darcy, but it ended up being better than Something Borrowed! Darcy will grow on you and you will see her grow and become the person you want her to be.
B0049MPHY4|5.0|I found this a bit difficult to read but loved the story. The challenge in reading was the details of the world - needed but heavy going. The story and the characters were haunting.
B000002KOJ|5.0|nobody in pop music has done better work than joni mitchell, and some of her best work is right here.  \\"both sides now\\" is as essential a spoke in the wheel of the '60s as anything written by bob dylan or the beatles.  a landmark.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Very well put together. Let's of fun. very simple to get into logic game that still gives a great challenge.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game. this has hours of playability and is not so easy that it get boring. def a game to kill time with.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Thank You<br />I got it in 2days like said... no missing DVD in case. Very Good Job. I have not watch the movie to see if there is any deffects.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|the game is simple yet fun just because of easy controls that are put into it. Overall a cool game to pass the time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These series of books were just amazing and it wasn't all about the sex. It was a great love story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great fun for the whole family has a little bit of something for all pf us and it is exciting to challenge yourself in a new way
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun. doesn't really matter if you die because you can start right over.  it does start freezing a bit so clear data but otherwise it's a great game.
034580404X|1.0|I was not a fan, the horrible writing really was a turn off! The writer repeates the same things over and over, and the story is no where near believable.
B005N6ABFA|4.0|This was a grouping that I always wished I could hear more recordings of.  I always wonder how many other great gigs are stored away in a vault somewhere?
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is a lot of fun. but some things are annoying ... for an example when you have to make posts on facebook to gain special points.... ha ha ha ha
B006RUJST6|2.0|I read both Slammed and Point of Retreat, and I admit that I enjoyed parts of both. BUT (and this is a pretty big one) the relationship between Layken and Will is utterly unrealistic (and to be honest a little disturbing). For one thing, the way he behaves when he first meets her is NOT attractive. If this happened in real life, I would be creeped out. Over the top, obsessive, inappropriate... it doesn't give the impression of a hopeless romantic, it gives the impression that he's a bit of a 'player.' The timing is also ridiculous - they meet, they go on ONE date, they find out the next time they see each other that they can't date - and the rest of the book is just them obsessing over this fact.<br /><br />Example - on the first day they met he lets himself into her car when she's asked (someone else) for directions to the supermarket, stating rather than offering that he is going to give her directions. He turns the music on to the cd that's already in the stereo, and the music blares. Layken goes to turn it down and he grabs her hand and just holds it for ages. Totally sexy, right? A perfect stranger grabbing your hand while you're driving for an inappropriate length of time? In all honesty, that's not the best example, but I don't particularly want to read it again to find better ones.<br /><br />Also, the damsel in distress routine is getting old. I hate that writers can't seem to write good romance without the female character needing rescuing. The scene where Will saves her from the unwanted attentions of her classmate is not heroic or sexy - it's creepy. Think about it - he thought she wanted the guy to kiss him, and he beat the crap out of the guy anyway and then proceeded to give her the silent treatment like she was a naughty child who had behaved badly. WHY DO PEOPLE SEE WILL AS A WONDERFUL CHARACTER???<br /><br />I don't want to seem too harsh - after all, writing a book is difficult, and clearly a lot of people love this book. All in all, I understandwhy people like this book - I read them both myself, and like I said before, I enjoyed parts - I just don't agree with it. I don't think this has particularly brilliant plot (tragedy in a character's life does not make a novel good), or great character development. If you have young children (particularly girls or teens) I thoroughly recommend you don't give them this book to read. I hate the message it gives about relationships and love (to me, the description of love in both books is just obsession). And yet, if she had just mellowed Will out a little, and made some of the plot features more realistic, I probably would have found no fault at all with this book.
0345803485|1.0|My boyfriend & I got this just to see what all the fuss was about; I've stopped looking, and have no clue still, except maybe that it's softcore porn with an edge dressed up like a novel. Granted, I have an issue with the whole bondage thing (I don't trust ANYONE that much...), so I was not at all excited by most of the sex scenes, which were surprisingly mild for all the hype, but as for the story...there isn't one. This is equal parts Harlequin Romance-of-the-Month & pornographic novel, falls back on all the cliches of both genres, is more poorly written than most of the romance shorts, and has about as much plot as either, which is to say, none. The entire story revolves around the main characters' very unlikely & wholly unbelievable relationship, and all of the intrigue there is based on his kinky sexual nature. The writing also offends my personal grammar Nazi, because, among other issues, the author seems to think \\"murmur\\", \\"mutter\\" & \\"said\\" are all interchangeable, she trades them off indiscriminately, and you wind up wondering why certain things would be murmured or muttered instead of just spoken. The \\"ending\\" is also, well, non-existent; the set is obviously 1 book in 3 parts, not 3 individual stand-alone books. That particular marketing quirk works for me: I don't have to keep reading this drivel!
B004UNX1LS|2.0|its an ok app but not reqlly thtat great bcuz the videos on my device r really fuzzyw this app maybe thats just my device just wonderin was any1 else experincin tht problem
B008JGSM6G|5.0|what a great app! reminds me of hypercube from the Internet, but in 2D! I love the multiple levels of difficulty.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is just a wonderful addition to any mobile device. It allows anyone to just break away from our hectic world and just relax, not to mention the smooth melodies we can customize to our own tastes. I'm so glad I have this. (:
034580404X|5.0|I loved all 3 books. They have a good story line along with the sex. I will read them again!!
B00701897I|5.0|If you like the Indiana Jones movies you will love Tintin.  The 3D is great.  Animation is fantastic.  I've watched it three times already and will watch it many more.  Can't wait until they make the sequel.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I don't have it yet but when I get it I know that it will be the best game in universe.  its a lot like a face book game I play called dragon city
B008D19WBQ|3.0|I was looking forward to this for a long time. I grew up watching friends and they were from the DVD sets. The fact that some of the best jokes in the show are not included because of the studio's lacking in the needs to make a blu-ray release, is sorely disappointing. It's not like George Lucas's edits for the blu-ray release of Star Wars where editing was intentionally done. This is a legitimate technical issue. I'm sure if the studio could release the uncut episodes, they would; so for that reason I am not angry about it. I may purchase this in the future, but for no more than $80.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i really enjoy playing this game. some of the games are challenging but that is what makes the game fun!
B000OONTFU|5.0|I was a bit worried about the quality of these movies when I first got the set. The first movie was released back in 99 and I was not sure how well the conversion would be. To my surprise, all three movies looked great. Well worth the purchase if you still got one of those HDDVD player things laying around...
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love how fun it is. you really have to think to solve the puzzle. very good job with this app. very fun app!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love this game! provides hours of fun and relaxing entertainment. a nice way to give your brain a beak from stress while exercising skills of accuity
0439023513|5.0|Not the exact ending I predicted (after reading and watching the first book), but pretty darn close. Would love to see the last two books come to life.
0345803485|1.0|I'm not usually this harsh of a critic but this has positivley got to be the worst written novel I have ever read.<br /><br />It seems to drag on forever with no depth at all and I continually ask myself who in the right mind would publish such an atrocity, stamping it with a seal of approval and completely believing that it would succeed in the literary world -- which graves me deeply that it has and that so many women 'enjoy' it. Are you kidding me?!?!<br /><br />Being of the younger generation, this entire thing is so unbelieveable and frivolous, I could take anything seriously. It was more of a turn off than ANYTHING that would make me want to beg my partner to do to me. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for experimentation but this is ridiculous!<br /><br />Orgasming multiple times while losing your virginity. Orgasming when he touches her. Orgasming when he looks at her. Organsming as she's plucking a chicken and cooking an egg. No. Just no.<br /><br />The story line aside, the writing is terrible. Repetative and drones on and on. You can only bite your lip so many times before you chew the thing off. The the idea of her 'inner goddess'... It's lame. I scoffed at every sentence.<br /><br />Don;t waste you time. These are hours of my life I will never be able to reclaim.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I have had this game a while. I really enjoy most of it. I have not used any real money in it, but still fine plenty to do and few bottle necks. You can get it and have fun for free.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its pretty good maybe you should add more games. I don't know what else to say the game is just awesome
1449305172|5.0|What I learned from this book is extremely valuable, practical and useful. A must read if you run a business startup
030758836X|5.0|'Gone Girl' has one of the cleverer plots and story lines for mystery fans. The reader is given no clue how the story will evolve, leading to surprise after surprise. We are exposed to each of the main characters's point of view on their relationship, wondering who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist. The denouement leaves the reader anticipating a sequel, as the characters become persons of interest with a potential for future surprises. The dialogue is sprinkled with vulgarities, but they are appropriate for the characters and the situations they experience.<br />D K Elliott, Author, The Canyon Caper
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is absolutely one of my favorite apps on my kindle fire! It is extremely easy to play and is very entertaining!
B004GTQ4DI|5.0|If you liked Little House on the Prairie, please do yourself a favor, and watch the series. This was a great series, photograpy was excellent and the locations and houses etc, horses and carriages were very authentic. The cast was excellently chosen. Loved every one of them. I appreciate the recommendations from Amazon. Without that I never would have known about them. Having the Prime Membership will get you a lot of free TV shows and movies. I loved watching the series on my KINDLE FIRE. It is the best.
B008D19WBQ|3.0|I don't have the set yet but I must write about the lack of extended episodes in the release. These episodes were made for the DVD release but they apparently don't have the original film. I understand why they can't create true high definition but upconvert it and put it in anyway. Make it an option atleast for those of us that are used to these extended cuts. I am not sure how many episodes are \\"extended\\" but they can't just cut all that content. I will buy the set simply because I love the series and want to see it in better quality I just wish that they had the extended episodes with HD stock and upconverted sections of missing film. I guess I'll have to keep the dvd set handy. I wish I never would have seen the extended episodes because I hate realizing that a line is missing like when you watch it in syndication.
B004GTOKO8|5.0|If you didn't like Little House on the Prairie, you probably won't care for this. I loved every second of every episode.<br />I was sorry when there were no more.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Worked ok when I got it.  I tried it again a few weeks later and it won't work at all.  I can't get a response from the company for warranty service.<br /><br />Update - I was able to get a hold of Fiio, and they directed me to the seller.  The seller sent a replacement, and it is working fine.  Updated to 4 stars because it works as expected.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is beautiful. From the second I opened it I was happy! It is so easy to use. Butterfly is my favorite.

B008645YEE|2.0|I have all three, Batman begins, Dark Knight, Dark Knight rises....<br />Just finished scanning the music... however I cannot find any memorible tracks...<br />for Batman Begin... I like track, 2,3,7,8,10<br />for Dark Knight... I like 8,10,12,14<br />For This one..... I really don't know.....all melodies were just familiar... and i though maybe they could be remastered into a good piece of music... however I can't find such.... sort of disappointed...
B005LAII08|5.0|Our entire family loved the film. The animation was superb-we would expect nothing less from the team of Disney/Pixar! The story line was realistic and entertaining. My children are 2 and 9 and neither was frightened by the film though it does have some darker scenes around the middle of it. My husband and I laughed out loud more than once in the course of the movie. I say get it. I know we will have it in our collection the day it is released. Can't wait to see it again!
B0082LUEW8|1.0|wtf is this?? what a disgrace!! all songs sound exactly the same!! same lyrics in two songs even!!  \\"u can take the piss out of me\\" lyric used in two songs rite next to each other track 10 and 11 wtf?? and no metal band should ever say the word \\"haters\\" in their lyrics, especially a band of 40+ metalheads!!! wtf guys?? there is no solos no anything except cruch cruch---crunch crunch---crunch crunch, but exactly the same crunch crunch on every song! unbeleivable!! and so lyricly lame i dont even know whare to start!! im left wondering if they are even trying.. my dad could write better lyrics and hes 70. and the music my dad listens to probly rocks harder than this crap! these guys need to make real metal for people their own age like all the other old metal bands.. whatever they are trying to do isnt working. it lacks the heavyness and the METAL that all us over 30 want!! and it doesnt have all the gay whinning and crying that the young metal dudes want to hear, so its pretty much useless!!
B0080CL0HM|4.0|This film was well made and I find no fault with the performances of any of the actors but with the screen writer. If I had not read the book, I would have been woefully lost as to the context of some of the scenes. The character of Duroy would have been better had they perhaps featured some of what would have had to appear as inner monologue to back light the scenes where he interacted with some of the other characters. While I felt that Robert Pattinson did a decent job of showing emotional range, it was mostly lost in translation. The film felt very rushed to me. I agree with other reviews that Georges is a character that you love to hate. It is not often that you watch the villain win the day in this way. Overall the film was a good one but it plays more as a companion piece to the novel rather than a stand alone film. In order to truly appreciate the characters, one must read the book first.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love having a full size calculator with me at all times. I love the save feature for reconciling my checkbook. thanks for a great product.
B007L96VCY|5.0|No need at this point for me to give much description of Paul's place in the musical universe or the songs on this issue.  I will say that I bought the 2-CD set in order to get the 33 min. bonus material, which is pretty good.  Many people already had a previous CD of Ram.  I have the gold CD, and the current one is a little brighter in sound, but not appreciably better.  The new remaster does bring to the fore even more of the remarkable sounds that Paul has created for so many years.  I can't think of another person on the planet who has Paul's genius for just creating interesting sounds -- whether they be ballads, edgy trippy jams, or just adding the right instrument at the right time.  My real complaint is that you can't get the Ram offerings \\"a la carte.\\"  I would love to get Thrillington and the mono mix of Ram, but in order to do so would have to spent $90+ on the whole package including a book and prints that don't interest me.  I suppose lots of folks will spring for the full box set, but it would be nice to be able to choose individual items, don't you think?
1603427244|5.0|Wow! All the different wasys to CO or BO! No having to look thru my files or blogs or search the internet. Its all just there in one place.  I really like this book for a great reference book and will keep it in my knitting bag.
0440178002|5.0|What a great book!  Well researched, well crafted, and after you're finished, well respected.  I remember reading this for the first time back in 1995...couldn't put it down.  Following I read all the rest of Clavell's works and was never disappointed.  Enjoy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is very much reminiscent of the old classic side scrollers I grew up with! Great graphics and handling. Challenging but not too difficult.

0307279189|5.0|This book has changed my attitude about running!  I thought I was an amateur runner at best, but after reading this book I now know I'm likely not bad as a runner.  I loved this book it was inspirational, giving me hope that this 46-year old body really does have many more years of running left in it.  I too have been plagued with injures that have prevented me from running at the level that I would love to.  But just a shift in my thinking after reading this book has allowed me not only to increase the distance I run each week but it has also allowed me to love running and to actually look forward to it.  This shift in me has come from learning that my body was designed to run, that it is natural for me to run just as much if not more then walk, that if I pay attention to my form and what my body is telling me during a 7-mile run that I will actually feel good in the middle of it (this has truly happened to me), then yes I can run, I can run for a really long time.  Look out marathon(s), here I come!
0345803493|5.0|This was the best book of the 3. This trilogy is definitely worth the read tho! Just so amazing. Enjoy! :D
B006RUJST6|5.0|The great reviews on this book will not fail you! Enjoyed every minute.  You fall in love with all of the characters and the author does a great job of making the characters relatable.  You will not be disappointed!
0345803507|5.0|Totally crazy...I loved it, but you get to the end and think...there just has to be another book. We need more info! Great product tho!
B00005V9HH|5.0|A great cast, a great director, a great story - what could go wrong? A lot. If you can figure out what the ending will be, you will do better than some of the stars. There are clues that you will see on the second viewing for the first time, and other subtle \\"things\\" on the third. All I can say is - enjoy.<br />Jim
B008K3HRF0|1.0|If the movie were clever or cute I could ignore the propaganda.  But, sadly, it wasn't.  It was extremely annoying.  Don't waste your money or time.
0938045768|5.0|I was trying to find out something new for exercise. I found this book and have really liked it. Some of the exercises are difficult but effective.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'll tell you how addictive this game is...  I'm a huge Dean Koontz fan and was anxiously awaiting his latest book \\"Odd Apocalypse\\" (which was excellent btw). The same day the book was released on Kindle, I also downloaded this game, Flow Free.  And throughout the reading of the Koontz book (which, normally I'll read a book straight through with the exception of eating and sleeping), I found myself alternating between Flow Free and the Koontz book.  I'd pick up my Kindle Fire to continue reading the book and find myself drawn into playing another 10 or 20 levels of Flow Free!<br /><br />Don't let the first few levels fool you, yes they are incredibly easy - think of those first levels as a warm-up for what is to come.  Once you get to the 9x9 levels and beyond, you'll be deeply addicted into getting those colored pipes connected.  Psychologically I think it appeals to the Obsessive-Compulsive tendencies in me. There is something extremely soothing in being able to figure out the right way of connecting the dots.<br /><br />Some people prefer word or card games, or action first-person, shoot-em-up kind of games.  But if you enjoy colors, spatial relation type puzzles then you'll love this game and quickly become addicted too.  A 3-D version would be mind blowing!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this game! I was almost finished with the free packs and was excited to see updates and more free boards!
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|If ever there were a reason to show people why music on a disc sounds better than an MP3...this is the album to do it with.  I can't believe how good the audio is..sounds like a recent recording.<br /><br />As for the album in general....it just never, ever, gets old....this is back before the suits started interferring with the artists and music business in general...yes there are still great artists out there today but sadly, you will probably never hear of them.<br /><br />\\"Time\\" is still one of my all time favorite songs..ever, period.  Brain Damage and Eclipse (just can't have one without the other) are what got me into floyd when I was very young.<br /><br />The artwork isn't jaw-dropping or anything but it's cool to have the lyrics included - the packaging isn't cheap cardboard either...it's like high gloss package that will definitely hold up.<br /><br />I can't recommend this album enough - you can literally listen to it over and over again and never get sick of it.
B008EL4YX6|3.0|...real battery hog though. With music off still rips through my battery more than 3D FPS games do.  If it was optimized, would for sure be a five star app.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Some people forget that this book is from a young college students ( girls ) perspective, one who knows little about her sexuality. So keeping that in mind, it is a fantastic book.  I would say more but it would be a huge spoiler.
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|I bought this dvd out of curiosity and it turned out to be much more than I thought. I only knew Richard Marx from a few of his hits but didn't expect him to be such an outstanding performer! Not only he has a fine voice with skill on guitar and piano, his interaction with his friends and audience made this concert, somewhat, special so unlike some other concerts where the singers didn't really give a damn about their fans who paid to see them. I've yet to see another singer who simply unplug his guitar, walked to the middle of the audience and sang! On top of all that, I now appreciate how incredibly talented this guy is with his singing and song writing skill (for other singers, I must add)<br /><br />To me, this is definitely one of my most surprising finds and I thoroughly enjoyed it, from start to end. I would highly recommend this dvd to everyone!
030758836X|5.0|WOW! I whipped through this book -- couldn't wait to see what was coming next. Great writing from different points of view. I'm very surprised to see some low ratings from other readers. My guess is that ...<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />... these readers didn't like the ending because it could be construed as vague and wasn't what they may have expected. But I wholeheartedly recommend the book for readers who are looking for a well-written and unique story. Can't wait for the movie version!
0439023513|1.0|It is highly tragic to have a series that started so awesome end in such a way that it was thrown together like a sandwich with mustard, chocolate candies, and what ever else was randomly lying in the pantry or refrigerator.<br /><br />\\"Mockingjay\\" tells of the revolt that the citizens of Panem, starting with those competing in the games, have against the government. It all leads to random deaths that occur in the droves (yes it could be a good thing, but in this case it doesn't work)and the way things sum up is just extremely random and there is no explanation as to how and why this is the ending that was chosen.<br /><br />The way this trilogy ended was a sheer disappointment that only happened, because it could. Reading the series just about comes with the load of what the first novel has to bring, but it's just a shame how the novels that follow \\"The Hunger Games\\" come far from reaching the mark.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it it gives you a whole lot of versions to choose from and some versions even can read it for you
0671027344|4.0|A wallflower is somebody who witnesses a fight and comforts one side of the argument or physical scuffle. They don't do anything during the fight, but instead act afterward. That's what the protagonist in this novel does. In this case, it happens to be someone who goes under the name \\"Charlie.\\"<br /><br />The whole novel is written in letter format. If you can handle dramatic letters that don't hold back any information, and I mean NO INFORMATION WHATSOEVER, then \\"Perks\\" should be just fine. Charlie writes to this \\"friend\\" that is never mentioned, and tells him anything and everything. He mentions his crazy family life, his love for reading and how he likes his English teacher and how he gives him books to read, but he especially mentions relationships he's been in and include a girl named Sam and her gay brother, Patrick. Many of the plot twists revolve around these characters, despite the fact that other characters play important roles as well.<br /><br />I felt this novel was an interesting treat. It was very bizarre, but in a good way and I liked it. It would be something to buy and something that would make for a good film. I would recommend this book for those who are going to see the upcoming film, as I believe that it WILL be something that people are going to check out.<br /><br />The one thing I'll remember is... Wow! Charlie is such an individual.

0439023521|5.0|If you took the Vietnam War and mixed it with Stephen King (or Richard Bachman)'s \\"The Running Man,\\" you would get \\"The Hunger Games,\\" a brilliant novel that has such a gruesome concept during a time period in which such a thing is taken very seriously.<br /><br />In this new utopia, a revolt in Panem, an area in North America, leads to the government creating an annual event known as \\"The Hunger Games.\\" Here, a male and female teenager from each of the twelve districts are forced as tributes by random draw in order to compete in a competition in which they have to kill one another until only one is left standing. The last one standing wins food and supplies for themselves and their district. Katniss Everdeen, a tough girl and leader of her family from District 12, offers herself as a tribute in place of her sister Prim. From there, she creates relationships with people such as Peeta from her district and Rue from District 11. It all leads to an exciting adventure in which young people have to pay for deeds in which the old people failed to resolve.<br /><br />It is just incredible how honest this novel is with a dark option for what the future could possibly bring. It's especially incredible how there is plenty of poking at the habits of the media. Before the actual games, the contestants are treated as celebrities, looking pretty and being told what to do by producers, but for many of them are heading to their death sentences.<br /><br />The elements to this novel were just awesome and if this novel was extended a little bit longer, there would have been no need for the rest of the trilogy. Just an awesome piece of young adult fiction, a very hardcore piece of young adult fiction.
0380729407|1.0|Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a tour de force in the over-use of metaphor and simile to the point that the reader must strain to follow the actual plot without being led repeatedly astray. The author also misuses words intentionally, for effect it seems, but to no discernible advantage. However, there is genius in the creative imagination that went into the plot - no doubt grist for a successful movie - where of course the metaphors and similes fade away as the screen writers and director are forced to visually develop the plot for the viewers. In toto, an very unenjoyably read.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|The Bourne Legacy explodes with all the typical screen-writing panache, exotic locations, explosive action sequences, hand-to-hand combat, and car chases that we've lovingly come to expect from any movie in the Bourne franchise, and it was so awesome to finally get to experience one of these movies again after Gilroy's 5-year hiatus from writing the Bourne movies. This film fleshes out the Treadstone/Blackbriar/Outcome programs universe, but also offers so much that is completely new to the franchise and doesn't feel in ANY way to be a repeat or rehash of the previous movies. I continuously marveled at everything from the shooting locations (the Canadian Rockies to the tropics of the Philippines), the stunning acting talent, (Weisz and Renner never disappoint!), and a new story that instilled far more empathy for the characters than the other Bourne movies. This is a must see! Strong argumentation could be made to reinforce this film as the best in the franchise. One of four films I've seen this year that was actually worth the cash paid out. Will I pay to see it again? Absolutely.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A well written series of books that grow in length with each \\"book\\".  Not only a very quick read, but a read that leaves you wanting more.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|The difficulty level ramps up fast in this one. After only three or four levels you'll be needing to think, and after 10 levels you're going to need a carefully-orchestrated plan that will take you four or five tries to nail down. It doesn't stop there; based on some of the user-created levels, it can get to a pretty insane level of difficulty. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course! But some may find it frustrating in pretty short order.<br /><br />Personally I prefer puzzle games with no twitch element; this one requires some accurate timing, at least, and one missed tap will certainly prevent you from an \\"A\\" grade and will frequently cause you to lose the level. It's not a relaxing thought puzzle.<br /><br />It also has basically no tutorial and no rules reference. There aren't too many things to learn, but in my opinion at least a single help page listing all the kinds of elements you might come across wouldn't be too much to ask.<br /><br />I still rate it pretty high because it's a clever and challenging mind-twister, and the number of levels is staggering - the 60 included puzzles are just the start, because there's over two *thousand* user-created levels available for immediate play. Those of course vary wildly in quality, but there should be enough to keep you going for a very long time. And after that, you can create your own! (I didn't try the level editor so I can't say how well-implemented it is.) The only downside to the user-created levels is that there's no A/B/C scoring or any indication of the minimum number of taps required, like in the 60 built-in levels; the only goal is to complete them.<br /><br />I rate this four stars instead of five partly because of the twitch element and difficulty (both of which may be positives for other people!), but also because I experienced a number of times when the game stopped responding to taps. This was mostly in the menus, but occasionally in-game as well. The only fix was to go back to my tablet's Home screen and re-launch the app, and at least once I had to do this twice to regain control. This happened at least a half-dozen times in half an hour of play, which is pretty bad. Hopefully an update will remedy this.

0812993292|5.0|This book is beautifully put together and has an absorbing, satisfying, and surprise ending story.<br /><br />It is a pilgrimage that Harold Fry goes on, and it includes tremendous awakening. At the beginning of the book is a quote from John Bunyon's \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" It's very appropriate. I have that book in my Kindle, because I want to reread it.<br /><br />Harold Fry is retired, has had a very unhappy life, and things between him and his wife are terrible. Then he gets a letter, writes an answer, walks to a mailbox to mail it, and just keeps getting the urge to keep walking until he decides to walk hundreds of miles to answer this letter-writer.<br /><br />It's really good not to know the ending in advance, so I won't tell it to you! But it really brings the book together. Highly recommended.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|Honestly the intentions behind the game are great. But because of the space required, you would need a completely erased Kindle Fire. Also with the whole Graphics argument, it's a mobile game. You're not going to get PS3/XBOX360 graphics. The game also freezes and causes force restarts on many occasions, causing you to lose progress. If the game was fixed it woould be amazing.
B000HR1YHE|4.0|Well, at least one of them is. The product details list an airdate for this episode of October 15, 1968. This is all kinds of wrong. The Cage was produced in 1964, and was never aired on network television.
0316010669|2.0|Here's some words that describe this lenghty and boring book - lenghty and boring to begin, not useful, too basic, did i mention boring? Oh yes i did. Outier is a way better read.

Use that instead, unless you're eating a hamburger.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great series to read.  I couldn't put it down.  It was nice to have all three books available to read at once.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I might be in the minority. But this was the most far fetched  book I have ever read.<br />It certainly didn't have more than 50 pages of a story. The rest was so repetitive that it became boring and stupid.<br />I bought book two because I wondered how the character Anastasia was going to tell him to take a hike.<br />That was equally as bad. I wouldn't waste my money on book three.  Certainly not literature!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  It was great to have the complete series available to read at any time. I would highly recommend this series.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This  game is very addicting, and challenging at the same time.  I really enjoy this game, and highly recommend it.  The higher levels can be frustrating, but are fun when you finally solve them.
B006ISJQBC|3.0|This flick is alright, I thought it would be better, Cast does a good job...not 100% sure what I didn't like about it...<br />Guess when I get these London crime movies I'm expecting \\"LOCK, STOCK\\", \\"SNATCH\\", or \\"ROCKNROLLA\\", or even \\"LAYER CAKE\\"...those I really enjoy, so I guess my expectations are just too high going in...this is not bad, not great, a little better than average but one thing is for sure....LONDON BLVD can't hold a candle to those Guy Ritchie flicks or even LAYER CAKE in my opinion, so to give 5 stars is just WAY too much.  3 and 1/2 stars for me!<br />So if u like those other four films a lot that I mentioned earlier, you'll probably be disappointed with this one...but this is as good or better than another one I kind of enjoyed, IN BRUGES.  Definitely entertaining enough to watch again though!

B00479SVBU|5.0|Sound quality is _better_ than I was expecting. The MP3 playback is virtually indistinguishable from use of the CDs that they replace (and the storage is ever so much smaller, one 8GB USB flash holds my entire music collection with room to spare).<br /><br />Incidentally, that MP3 storage part offers something that I didn't see mentioned anywhere. I used Audacity for my tape-to-MP3, and CDEx for CD-to-MP3; the former has the more sophisticated \\"dynamic range compression\\", the latter has the computationally cheaper \\"normalization\\" (limiting the range rather than compressing it). Creating my own MP3s allows me to tailor them, in this case for a more constant volume as would be desirable in the ambient noise of a car underway.<br /><br />I'd phoned in on the day the Soundfly arrived in order to confirm that additional remotes could be purchased, as the Play/Pause dome on mine was somewhat soft compared to the others. Additional purchases were assured (I was told $5 on their website), I was offered a free one in the mail (declined, but I was *very* impressed that Satechi had made the offer), and anyway that particular function is a button on the main unit also (so this was one of the few buttons that I could live without anyway).<br /><br />The only detraction for me would appear to be the navigation. I don't honestly see how with such a small screen (three lines, a few characters on each one) it could have been done significantly better (there's no room for a tree-structured approach such as with the Windows XP/Vista/7 \\"explore\\" file manager function). To me, this issue may be easily resolved by having fewer items to navigate across. Huh? When I recast my CDs as MP3s, instead of accepting a folder (=CD) of tracks (=songs), I'll just cast the whole CD as one big track (in CDEx you select all tracks, then use F10 to \\"copy partial tracks\\" to one file). That will give me a handful of \\"songs\\" to navigate across, and no folder depth.<br /><br />This is a company that I wishwell, and certainly can recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE: An hour or so in a car with the manual, and I've improved the navigation 3 -> 4. It would appear that there are button functions on the remote not duplicated on the main unit (no surprise there), and on the main not duplicated on the remote (that's more unusual). So I _can_ navigate around folders as well as files, and won't be redoing my collection as one-track-per-CD.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Seriously, this app is the single most useful utility I've found.  In addirion to giving the user an instant snapshot of how much juice they've got left but also a pretty accurate estimate of how long a given situation will last with what's left.  Thanks for a really great FREE application. They also have one without ads for a couple of bucks.  I just bought the app for my smartphone and it is going to be one of those indispensable applications I'd rather not give up.

1932100660|5.0|I finally read this study, after reading many other health based books, which cited it.  The publication gives a very detailed and informative approach on the study's experiments.  Charts and graphs are provided even in the kindle edition.  In addition, Dr. Campbell explains how diseases work their way through the human body and how the nutrients in foods we eat affect our cells and diseases.<br /><br />Sometimes you have to educate yourself:<br /><br />Twelve years ago, at the age of 23, I began my quest for better health after my dad suffered a massive heart attack from which he did not survive. He was only 51 and had been a type 2 diabetic for a decade.  His father passed at the age of 50 (before I was born) of panceatic cancer.  My dad never met his grandchildren and my grandfather only met 2 of his 7 grandchildren.  One day a thought came to mind:  my dad and grandfather were middle-aged at the age of 25!  That was an inspirational, life-changing moment.  I ended up going to a Borders Books with the intention of purchasing a book about heart disease or diabetes.  Instead, I purchased a book titled \\"Nature's Cancer Fighting Foods\\", which was the first book I read that cites Dr. Campbell's China Study.  At that time, I gave up eating meat.<br /><br />One thing I've learned:<br />Good health is precious.  Learn and live well.<br /><br />If you are interested in knowing what the food you eat is doing to your health, read The China Study.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|This single composer makes music that sounds somewhat similar to and is equal in epicness to 2 Steps From Hell. Some of the tracks on this cd sound like they should be in a major Emmy Award-winning film. There is a good variety of songs in this album, many of which are very deep and inspirational, while other songs are just outright adrenaline pumping. Definitely Reccommended!
B008EL4YX6|3.0|A speed-based puzzle game, simple but effective.  My concern is that, with my Droid 4, the music causes an alarming clicking/popping noise to come directly from my speaker.  It doesn't sound intentional, and it sounds like it might be damaging my hardware.  Just be cautious.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Returning to bat with this offering after the great Formation of Damnation album, Testament offers listeners to Dark Roots of The Earth.  I have listened to this album through twice completely along with listening to tracks off XM for the past month and I must say the wait was worth it.  This has excellent mixing and production, the guitar work is superb, Gene Hogland stepping back behind the drum kit for Testament did well.  There were some interviews and pre-release criticism of the use of blast beats on a couple of songs, but I hear nothing that wasn't necessary.  The was a very dark heavy fast tone on most of the songs, but there were nice slower tempo songs like Cold Embrace (a well crafted ballad), and for the most part the title track.  Throne of thorns also had nice intro and outro work.  Very solid album. My personal favorites are Cold Embrace, Native Blood, and Throne of Thorns.  I did get the Deluxe edition with 4 bonus tracks of Dragon Attack (Queen cover), Animal Magnetism (Scorpions Cover) and Powerslave (Iron Maiden Cover) and all of these are very adequate, worth the extra cash, along with bonus extended version of Thone of Thorns.  The DVD has the making of dark roots, and \\"Live at The Avalon\\" with performances of Deciples of the Watch, Practice What You Preach, Over The Wall and Souls of Black video to watch.  There is also the Gear Tour feature with Alex and Eric showing off their stuff.  Very much worth the extra cash.  Over all excellent album, great bonus features, excellent packaging.  A must buy for testament fans, and I believe a good intro to new thrash fans on what Testament and thrash should sound like.  It is excellent to have these guys continuing to care as much as they do, just like Anthrax, Megadeth, Death Angel, Machine Head, and Slayer have done with their latest albums.  Thank you Testament.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|I enjoy everything about this game from its simply drawn graphics .  The idea is to bounce a little yellow ball (that you do not control) off walls and red right triangles which you rotate with a tap until the ball exits through a small circle.  You are given a goal for an \\"A\\" score, for example three taps.  There are a gazillion levels AND you can design your own.  My kind of game.<br /><br />There are special kinds of walls with spikes that kill the ball and special caroms that you don't control.  You only control the red triangles.  Depending on the orientation of the red triangle, the ball will change direction or go back where it just was.  Very nice game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|interesting and provides multiple levels of fun. uses your logical brain power. great for math skill building. I will recommend for kids and audults

The old Zepper has never sounded better and continues to surround himself with other talented musicians.

B000002JR8|5.0|Damn.  This album is Metal.  You know why it's called Metal?  Because it's harder than Rock.  This is my first Pantera album and I'm wondering where it has been all my life.  Coming from mainstream rock and soft-metal, Pantera was recommended to me by a good friend.  Crazy guitar, wicked Bass and striking Drums coupled with insane Vocals deliver a performance for the ages.  Magic is made here.  Buy it, now.
B005RUUUAI|3.0|Season 1 was a lot better. Although you can't go to the next season without seeing this one...just too many important plot developments.
B007MS5B6Q|4.0|I've been hooked on this show since day one, but Season 2 was (initially) a let down to me. Darabont left, the budget got cut, and some good ideas paid the price for it. When I first watched Season 2, I thought the plot was a drag and inferior to the incredible pilot this show had. The Sophia storyline was way too dragged out and rarely leaving the farm did little to give us a better idea of the world the characters are living in... HOWEVER, I rewatched all of Season 2 when AMC reaired it a few weeks ago, and I gotta say that when you watch the episodes in that rapid-fire way (in contrast to waiting a week in between episodes), the plot doesn't drag as much as I initially felt. Rewatch it and you'll see your opinion change about the pacing. I still feel Season 2 was inferior to Season 1, but it did enough to keep me entertained and looking forward to Season 3. Let's just hope that it paints a better picture of their world. If I hadn't rewatched it, I would have given this 2 or 3 stars. Lori still needs to get eaten, though. Hopefully in a very slow and agonizing way. Seriously, what was with her basically telling Rick to off Shane one minute, and then being all disgusted when he actually does it? I can't stand her.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very clear. easy calculator.  Big numbers.  All the basic essentials.  Just right for my Kindle Fire.  No problems loading or using.  So convenient.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Highly erotic.  Not terribly well written.  Good summer reading.  I had no idea what is was about when I started reading it, but I finished all three books.  It's definitely a women's book.  Some of my friends started reading the first book and never finished it.  They thought it was trash.  I think that maybe some of them wouldn't admit reading it all the way through, but knowing them as I do, I tend not to believe some of them.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|This release is breathtakingly good.  I can't tell you how strange it is to hear an album by the Beach Boys in the last 30 years that not only does NOT suck, but is actually superb.<br /><br />Beginning with the opening vocal intro which segues into the single, \\"That's Why...\\" you feel like you've stepped back to the days when they could actually come up with songs like \\"Sail on Sailor\\".  Happily there's not a clunker it the bunch, but it's the closing 4 tracks together that are as good a sequence of songs as anything they've ever done.  Ever.  If this album is their swan song, so be it because the last 4 songs feel like the last chapter of a beautiful sad book.<br /><br />And finally, I also find this particular lineup of Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce, and David Marks (back from the earliest era) plus crack members of their touring band, to be totally authentic as opposed to many of various fake Beach Boys lineups over the decades.<br /><br />I still can't believe it...
B005RUUUAI|5.0|...still had me on the edge of my couch. The Walking Dead is by far the best zombie series ever! I am anxiously waiting for Season 3.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|While the topic seemed intriguing and the actors are well-known and accomplished, the pace of this movie is not only painfully slow, but appears to have nowhere to go. Over an hour into the film and the character flaws revealed in the first 15 minutes are still in evidence without any further development. And the story line is also painfully predictable. Without spoiling the outcome for others, the director pretty much clubs you over the head with where the story will go early on so there is no need to watch the whole movie. And the complete lack of action/interest/motivation from either of the parent characters is totally unbelievable.

0786890762|1.0|I like a couple of Cecelia's other books. I don't know why this book was written. The whining, complaining, and victim state of the main character made me want to pull my hair out. Then you have about 10 extraneous characters who have nothing to do with the plot, but you'll read all about their boring, irrelevant lives.<br /><br />Really, really bad.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I really like it when I purchase a backpack that is very functional and looks great, this thule crossover not only met my expectations, it had other functional surprises in store for me. I've owned many backpacks but always felt something was lacking, this was not the case for this backpack.<br /><br />Initially I was worried that I wouldn't be able to pack much into it as I was planning to use it as my weekend backpack but that was quickly put to rest when I managed to stuff in everything I needed for the weekend: 2 sets of clothes, 1 set of gym clothes, accessories, etc. And the best part was I didn't have to dig around for my laptop or ipad because it was conveniently accessible in a seperate back section.<br /><br />I didn't think I've make use of the space between the front pocket and bag but it's proven to be very handy for stuffing thin jackets and scarves in when I wanted my hands to be free.<br /><br />When stuffed to the brim, the backpack does protrude quite abit from your back but which stuffed backpack doesn't.<br /><br />Love the design, love the functionality even more. Feels very sturdy. Looking forward to getting many years of use from it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|you really need to get this app. wonderful. it lets you know percentage of the battery and all of that stuff. get this app.
0307577589|5.0|This audiobook arrived earlier than promised and in perfect condition. Great vendor!  The story itself, though, is one I wouldn't recommend.  I haven't seen the movie version yet, but the book is so \\"wordy\\" until it finally gets into the substance of the story, I had trouble paying attention. While I am sorry the author died before he know how successful his trilogy was, I'm not excited.
B008COD5OO|5.0|This came exactly how i ordered it, not to mention its a great movie. i would definitely recommend this to a friend
B0063GORYU|4.0|Also would like hint and back button to stay on screen.  Otherwise it's as good a game of spider as any other.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I began this book with great anticipation as I had read a review of it in a reputable newspaper and they had said it was pretty good.  The beginning is ok and quite well written as the author sets the scene for a 'who dunnit' missing persons...it soon becomes obvious what is happening and the book pretty much goes down hill from there.  The second half is badly written. I almost felt like it was written by a different person, it was so different from the first half.  Did the author start out well and then got a ghost writer to finish it off?  The second half is clichéd and the characters badly constructed, so much so that i felt they were almost cardboard cutouts! The plot is wildly unbelievable even if you take into account the usual 'willing suspension of disbelief' one must have when reading a novel and the end felt like it just dropped you in the middle of nowhere.  I felt really let down by this book and I would strongly discourage other readers from wasting their time even starting it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game.... if this game was 100$ it would be some what worth it 50$ would be more worth it.... this game is hardish but sometimes I wish it was just a little harder but it gets a little harder along the way!

076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom is about an old man, a young man, and life's greatest lessons. Death can be viewed as a chance to teach people to live their lives to the fullest. Mitch was a former student of Brandeis University who began visiting an old professor by the name of Morrie Schwartz after seeing him on the television show \\"Nightline\\". Morrie had been diagnosed with ALS and did an interview with Ted Koppel to help inform people of how he is living with this debilitating disease. When Mitch realizes that one of his favorite professors is dying he feels the need to reach out to him.  Mitch goes and visits Morrie and this one visit turns into weekly teaching sessions that occur each week on Tuesdays until the day Morrie dies. They discussed a specific topic each Tuesday they met. Mitch wanted the clarity that Morrie had so he made a list for each visit. Morrie taught Mitch about death, fear, aging, greed, marriage, family, society, forgiveness and having a meaningful life. As the meetings went on Mitch began realizing how he had let society dictate his happiness in life. He began to realize what is really important in life and how to have that true happiness Morrie speaks of. Over time and after all of these teachings Mitch realizes he is a changed man because of Morrie.There are many social aspects that are discussed in this book. Some of these aspects are death, love, family, emotions, ageing, materialism, marriage, culture and forgiveness. Each of Morrie's lessons to Mitch stresses the importance of making your own culture and to not allowing the culture of society to dictate how you live your life. Mitch Albom found a way to describe positive aspects of dying from meeting with Morrie. Morrie on the other hand hopes Mitch is not faced with some of the same regrets he had for things he did not fulfill in life.Mitch is pleased with the lessons he has learned that have helped change him back to the person he was in college. Mitch allowed the norm of culture to change his beliefs over the years. Society made him scared to think outside the box and Morrie taught him it is okay for him to make his own culture to live in. Morrie saw his disease as an opportunity rather than a tragedy. He realized that if you accepted that you could die at any time that you would do nothing about it and just wait for it to happen. He also realized how focused people were on materialistic items and how much valuable time is wasted with these materialistic items.Mitch Albom created a way to make you feel like you lived through this time with him in this book. He makes you think about death and dying and how that can affect your everyday life. This book could change the way you currently think about some social aspects of life. It makes you think about the way you treat people, how you are living your life and the appreciation you should have for life. You need to live each day as if it was your last. The fulfillment you would have from this would add meaning to your life. This book makes you think about how society can dictate aspects of what is important in life. People should make decisions for themselves and not for the norm of society. People need to look at what will make them happy and follow through until they reach that self-happiness. They should not wait until they get news of death to try to live a lifetime of wishes in a short period of time.

B0059XTUVI|5.0|\\"The Iron Lady\\" is a fantastic movie.  It so accurately depicts the integrity and fight which Margaret Thatcher so embodied.  Meryl Streep was terrific.  The entire part about the Falkland Islands was great.  Also, I learned something new and that was how Thatcher aged so much so quickly and how her personality changed so dramatically.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is really fun. it may not be the finest but it is great. they should make a combination of Where's my Perry and Angrybirds

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really??  I like erotica but this is pure tripe.  The characters weren't even close to believable never mind likeable.  The author repeated the same sex scene over and over and over.  How many times did she use the word mercurial?  Boring, repetitive and because of the hype this author is making a fortune.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|My 2 boys are crazy about angry birds. This is the newest game and my sons love the little birds that come with it.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Purchased to replace stock AMD cooler on FX-4100 CPU. Was not able to overclock past 4.2GHZ without voltage increases and significant heat. Once replaced with this cooler I was able to hit 4.6GHZ with less heat then the previous clock. Its now running even cooler than the slower overclock with less voltage! It won't go over 43 C under stress testing. This is with a 1GHZ overclock! It like magic. There is a reason why this is the most popular cooler around.
034580404X|1.0|I've heard so much hype about these books, I couldn't wait to read them. Well I read them and I don't see what the big deal is. It's the same thing over and over. I'm a avid reader, and these were<br />so boring, unless you don't read much. There was no plot.

1469984202|5.0|Well, I bought these stories on a whim, thanks to the glowing reviews.  And guess what?  I'm adding my own glowing review.  These short stories form an outstanding novel.  You will want this omnibus edition, as it would be simply impossible to read just one of the stories and not want to know what happens next.  Wool Omibus delivers on heart stopping action and deep character development - it is a great read, and I'm just sooooo bummed that it's over.  (Although I did buy the 6th book, which I'm already 20% through even though I just downloaded it last night.)<br /><br />I was very much caught up in the dramas of all the characters involved, especially Juliette.  I just loved how Howey wrote such a strong, smart and fearless female character for the last portion of the book.  Juliette will forever be remembered as a true science fiction heroine.  If anything, she shone so brightly in this story that it made the other characters seem weak and vulnerable, which I guess they were in varying degrees.  Different readers will sympathize with different characters, I expect.  All in all, though, the lead characters show a complex and realistic reaction to the idea of living underground and being governed by a manipulative and secretive organization.<br /><br />What really struck me about this book was the examination of group psychology and limitations of brainwashing.  God willing, I will never find myself in a  predicament as dire as the inhabitants of the Silo, but it's interesting to imagine how I might react to the obstacles the heroes face in this rich and totally imaginative story.  Would I question authority if it meant my death?  Would I distance myself from my spouse if HE questioned authority in such a setting?  Would I go mad living underground???  Chances are, I wouldn't make it very long in the silo world, but it's fascinating to imagine my own reaction to the setting.<br /><br />The book is a quick read, but long enough to be satisfying.  I thought about thebook when I wasn't reading it, and I read it at all available opportunities.  It was one of those reads that made me look forward to doing my cardio workouts, as I read to pass the time while I sweat.  (But honestly, I had to stop pedaling during the particularly awful scene in the last story - readers will know it when they get there - I literally caught myself holding my breath and feeling sick for the character!)  Buy the books - you won't regret it.  And then you, too, will have a new favorite story and author!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|As a fan of 70s, classic, and melodic rock, I had high expectations for this CD. \\"Analog Man\\" exceeded them.<br /><br />The songs are polished to near-perfection. Many are co-written with Tommy Lee James, a top country-rock songwriter. Even though I'm not particularly a fan of country, these co-written compositions stand out for their high lyrical and musical quality. The other compositions are very good as well, maybe a little less strong in the lyrics department.<br /><br />Joe's guitar and vocal performances are absolutely top-notch. The guitar parts are tasteful and interesting. The licks sound like they came from the 70s, yet they seem original and fresh.<br /><br />Last but not least, this album is co-produced with Jeff Lynne. The production quality is five stars easily. If you like Jeff Lynne, as I do, you'll probably love the album. If you don't, or don't like what he does in his productions, you may not like it. A good way to determine whether or not you like the album is to listen to the samples on this page. Interestingly Jeff plays drums on most of the tracks and is impressively competent.  His drum parts are fairly basic but they provide all that the songs need. Ringo Starr guests on one track as well.<br /><br />To me, this album is a pleasure from beginning to end, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is my favorite game of all times on my tablet. the graphics are interesting and may not be the best to some people. the game is simple: you stole an idol from a temple and run away from demon monkeys that want to eat you. you can purchase all powerups and characters without using real money. plus there are no ads!!! you must get this game.

0062206281|3.0|I loved, loved, loved The Angel's Game and Shadow of the Wind. Loved them. Loved the characters, the stories, the language...Both novels were so evocative. This one is well-written and lyrical, but if you haven't read the first two, or read them recently, you will be totally lost with this one. I spent much of my time trying to remember characters and story lines and details from the other novels to put this one in proper context. There were numerous references made, and if you haven't read the others, this one won't make much sense, and won't satisfy you. This book read more like a transition than a complete story/novel. It sounds like there will be another one after this, and I will probably read it, but I sincerely hope Zafon returns with a complete story.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is the 20th studio album from RUSH, and their best in decades, This new release finds Rush in top form and at the height of their success they are just as big as they were back in the day,Rush never fit into the neat box because you either got it or you didnt, every track on this release is amazing it captures the best of Rush removed keyboards for a more stripped down feel Bass,Guitar and drums, If your a fan it's a must own, every track is stellar on this brand new release from Rush, In my opinion their best in years!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of puzzles, easy to understand. It's easy to pump out a few puzzles when you have some spare time, and they get progressively more challenging.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|I absolutely love this music app! DigitallyImported is thee BEST for people who love any form of Techno, Trance, Electronica, Dubstep, Electro-House etc.. there are many many channels to choose from! There are very little adds and the mixes go on for like.. ever lol I would absolutely reccomend this app to anyone that loves the &quot;beep boop bop&quot; music Haha! Its very simple to use and navigate also! I have not had a single problem with this app. A+ and 5 stars!
0439023513|3.0|I've always said that in a trilogy there is at least one of the books that doesn't compare to the others. Sometimes it's the second, sometimes the third one. Pullman's His Dark Material is the exception. And the Hunger Games are no exception: I found the third installment quite disappointing: the story (a war) has lost the innovative ideas and plot that the other books offered. The characters are more one-dimensional, and the love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peeta is totally unconvincing. Such a shame.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Motorola Xyboard<br /><br />App works great. The only thing that could make this app sweeter is a GNT translation.<br />5 stars.

B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I have no idea why the original cable crumbled...yep, crumbled...a pile of white plastic stuff showed up in the Kindle pouch...so, I ordered a new cable.  This one seems to be made of a better grade of covering...and it works!!!  Here's to a long life for it even though you don't have to charge the Kindle very often.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was so enjoyable to read, I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading it, but it blew me away!  I couldn't put it down, and I didn't want to!  I was so happy that the sequel, Point of Retreat, was ready and waiting for me b/c I just didn't want the story to end.  Truly a great read!

B00004RHZU|4.0|Well, I'll just have to break this album down, track by track:<br />1. Split Personality. Fun, energetic beginning song to P!nk's musical career. It's catchy and lyrical. I like it! 4.9 out of 5.<br />2. Hell Wit Ya. One of the first P!nk songs I ever heard. It's pretty (very) catchy, and different. This song shows that P!nk is not like any other common musical figure. 5 out of 5.<br />3. Most Girls. Had this frigger stuck inside my head for weeks! 3 out of 5.<br />4. There You Go. I heard it first from Greatest Hits. It was really big back then, when it was newer, and I enjoyed hearing it! I'm sick of it now, but I liked it then. 4 out of 5.<br />5. You Make Me Sick. I wish I had the nerve to sing this to a girl I like! 5 out of 5.<br />6. Let Me Let You Know. I didn't enjoy this as much as other P!nk songs, per se, but it's not her worse. 3 out of 5.<br />7. Love Is Such A Crazy Thing. I don't have too much to say about it, other than that it was different. It showed a different side of P!nk. 4 out of 5.<br />8. Private Show. Fun, catchy, P!nkish music! The kind of song that made me fall in love with P!nk! 5 out of 5.<br />9. Can't Take Me Home. It's the title of the album for a reason! 5 out of 5.<br />10. Stop Falling. Only ever heard it once before, don't really remember it, so I'll give it 5 out of 5.<br />11. Do What U Do. Innocent, fun. 5 out of 5.<br />12. Hiccup. Another style of P!nk :) <3!!!! 4 out of 5.<br />13. Is It Love? A sad ending to the album. It's sad because it's the end of P!nk's first awesome album! 5 out of 5.<br />Overall, this P!nk album scores 4 out of 5 on my amazon.com review.<br />IGNORE THE HATERS, IGNORE THE LOVERS... BUY THE ALBUM YOURSELF!
0345528581|5.0|I've worked out at a gym for over a decade, but wanted some exercises for on the go.  When I have no weights, I still need my pump.<br /><br />Bought this book, and it's great.  Loaded with exercises that even this gym rat wouldn't have figured on my own.  Legs, too (many varieties of squats, lunges, etc.), which is hard to do without weights.<br /><br />Monochrome photos of each exercise, and many I would not have thought of on my own.  Inventive ways to use a door, etc.<br /><br />If one learns, say, a dozen great exercises to use for life that they would not have considered otherwise, the book would be worth its price.<br /><br />This gym rat learned at least two dozen.  Recommended.
B008EL4YX6|3.0|uninstalled after two levels. not much into these kind of games. that being said - kudos to any app that lets you create your own levels!
B007WCJSWA|4.0|I bought the CD based on my knowledge of Mike's background.  While I enjoyed it I find that I've only listened to it a few times.  The playing is excellent but it doesn't move me.
0307279189|5.0|Well written book, I had a hard time putting it down.  I ran X-country in high school and have kept up a little running since then. I could really relate.  I don't know, but I would assume that if you weren't a runner it wouldn't be nearly as interesting.<br /><br />The characters in this book are larger than life, and McDougall, plays them up with all of their idiosyncrasies and super human qualities.  At times he had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />What I found most helpful about the book was the way he completely destroyed modern running shoes.  He systematically showed how modern running shoes with all of their padding actually cause you to run incorrectly and lead to most of the modern day runners pains and injuries.  I've suffered with foot and hip troubles my whole life, and I've assumed that they were just part of the territory of being a runner.  Since reading the book about a month ago, I've tossed out my running shoes and replaced them with \\"no support\\" toe shoes.  My feet and hips have never felt so good in my life.  Although I must admit that my calves and glutes feel like they are full of knives when I get back from runs.  (but like most athletes I've talked to I feel as though sore muscle pains are good pains, ligament and joint pains are not good pains)<br /><br />On one level the story was entertaining, however the bigger take away was that my running life has changed and my feet,ankles,knees and hips are daily thanking me for reading this book.  Running is becoming fun again.
B008QE9VJI|4.0|Every once and a while you need a movie like this - quirky, dark, brooding, lavish, silly and unpretentious.  I went in with low expectations but was pleasantly surprised.  It never set out to change the world - just entertain.  Wonderful sets, costumes and make-up are a given with a Burton film, but this one had wit, charm and good writing.  There were no huge surprises but I didn't care.  It took me somewhere I enjoyed being, and entertained me while I was there with enjoyable characters and a fun tale.  I will definitely watch it again.
0345529057|5.0|I'm only in the second book at the moment but so far I would recommend the books, they are fun reading.  These aren't on the fantasy level and Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit but little or nothing is.  These books are also an easy read so a young adult or child could even read through them with little or no difficulty.  But a parent might want to go through the book before letting a child read them (to decide if they what their child reading these books) since there is adult context in them, nothing x rated but r rated with out a doubt.  I have enjoyed them very much so far.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|i thought it was ok at best 1st one was good i think what do u think about the movie any one
B003IKMR0U|3.0|There's not much depth to Zombie Dice.  It takes about 2 minutes to learn and games with my friends typically run about 5 minutes in length.  It's fun, but not the kind of game you'd specifically get together with friends or family to play.  It's a game you might play while waiting for players who are running late or as a break between more substantial and time-consuming games. Watch the episode of \\"Tabletop\\" on YouTube which featured Zombie Dice for a closer look at gameplay.
B000OPPBEQ|1.0|Buyer Beware!<br /><br />I have received an extra copy of Matrix: the reloaded, but missing Matrix: Revolutions.<br /><br />Very disappointed in the purchase that such a simple thing can go wrong. Since I have the DVD version of Revolutions already, I probably won't bother returning it, but it is still very disappointing.
B005JR3ERK|5.0|Lots of Suspense,Humor and unexpected twists and turns. Jesse and Walt's relationship is very unique. Jesse is a former student of Walt's and they are now cooking meth together. 5 Stars for seasons 1-4! Heads Up not for young kids. Can be very gruesome at times.

B007EW9ISM|3.0|When I ordered Cosmonaut to use for my new iPad I thought It will be the perfect stylus I've ever had. especially Its not a cheap one and its from studio neat who I consider to be an innovative company.<br />to make it short here are the cons:<br />- Some times it doesn't register the touch, especially if you are drawing and need to move pretty fast to get specific effect (Like in Paper 53 App).<br />- Its big and pretty heavy which makes it hard to take it with you everywhere you go.<br />- It easily attracts dust so you need to always clean it with water.<br />- Its tip still not that small unlike the impression I got when I saw it in images.<br /><br />the pros:<br />- Its good for note taking<br />- however its big and heavy it still feels very good in my hand while using.<br />- It looks awesome and different :) :)<br /><br />The conclusion is Cosmonaut is an above average stylus, buy it only if you want to hold a stylus that looks different.

B002BI6SMI|5.0|If you like non-stop action with not too complicated a story, then this movie is for you. You may be thinking \\"Well, Liam Neeson is NOT an action star,\\" and you'd be right in general, but here, he unleashes everything he's saved up in his entire career.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect when I rented this, but I'd gladly watch again. And, rest assured, at 90 minutes this movie isn't so short because it cuts out important plot points or skimps in any way; when the film is over, I didn't want any more from it. Take it for what it is-a 90-minute thrill ride, and prepare yourself for some previously unseen Neeson action! Do it. Now. One-Click that s*$#. Enjoy.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|It's always hard to watch a film after you've read the book that it was based on. I always try and think of them as two separate entities. In the Film, \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" it was very difficult not to think about the book because a lot of important plot points and dialogue were left out.<br /><br />Having read the actual book by Lionel Shiver, I found the movie translation rather disjointed and bland. I know it's impossible to add every detail of a book into a film, but a lot of the scenes were wasted on images of home improvement projects gone awry.<br /><br />This should have been a better movie for the simple fact that the subject matter of a school killing is chilling, controversial and timely. It almost felt like the director depended on that so much that the actual story got lost in the almost two hours of blurry, nonlinear images.<br /><br />What really bothered me is that the description of the movie promised a \\"chilling \\"ending. Like the book, it is quite clear how this is story is going to end from the very beginning.  What was truly chilling about the book, were the last few chapters that outlined the plotting and planning and what really happened on that \\"day.\\" The movie wasted an opportunity and instead of really getting into Kevin's mind, we are left with images of Swinton  painting, scrubbing and power sanding.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading the book as the film leaves out too much meat of the story in favor of artsy filler.
1400069289|3.0|The data behind everything and how our brains work to create habits was eye opening. It was a good read, but I will most likely never re-read it. I recommend this book for anyone that loves facts, data, and research on how things work.
0553386794|5.0|Took a bit to get into this book because the chapters are told by characters and it takes a little while for all the characters and plots to come together but, WOW, do they come together.

B003VANOFY|3.0|Pros:<br />Sound Isolation, Good Construction, Charging Design, Great Microphone, Battery Life, Good Bass, Great Sound<br /><br />Cons:<br />Slightly Uncomfortable, Sound Bleeding, Initial Driver Issues<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Yes, I would recommend these to a friend<br /><br />---<br /><br />I bought these to replace my Sennheiser PC151 gaming headphones, which had issues with the wiring (hence prompting a purchase of wireless headphones). I was amped about this product when making the purchase, but became slightly less so once they had arrived and began using them.<br /><br />First, within seconds of putting these on, I had encountered the dreaded \\"right ear only and bass distortion\\" issue. This was corrected with some helpful tips from other users with the same problem, but I can't help but feel i'm merely \\"working around\\" this issue and limiting the potential of these cans. Using latest firmware (8.30.86 at the time of this writing) did not help, and workarounds were still required.<br /><br />Also, as my first pair of closed-back, circumaural (ie- over-the-ear) headphones, I had not anticipated this, but there is a noticeable amount of pressure in the ears when wearing these. It feels like I've put a drinking glass to my ear, and while this effectively serves to innately block outside noise (I'm constantly asking people talking to me to repeat themselves), it is a bit uncomfortable. Perhaps it is the material of the ear cushions (these are like a faux-leather) or the fact these are completely closed in, but I've seen more \\"breathable\\" over-the-ear cans, which may provide slightly more comfort and air circulation to the ears.<br /><br />Despite this completely closed design, there is still (surprisingly) some audio bleeding. This is not a deal-breaker for me, personally, but might be for some. Most video reviews found at various sources make note of this with examples.<br /><br />And one final gripe is that currently these do pinch my head just a bit, although I do have a large head. While not painful, some adjusting is needed over long gaming sessions. This is typical of new headphones and will likely self-correct over time once both the cushions and headband break in a bit.<br /><br />As far as sound quality goes, it is very good. I was only slightly more impressed with my old Sennheisers'. I listen to a lot of bass-heavy music, and was pleased that the bass levels were well balanced--pretty tight and not overpowering. Mids and highs are also pleasing to the ear. There is a built-in equalizer in the latest software (which I've not really messed with) which can alter the default values, but overall out of the box the sound is good.<br /><br />The 7.1 audio is a bit gimmicky for me (it's emulated 7.1 through 2 physical speakers), but I have found it to be pretty neat/useful on occasion during some gaming sessions. Overall, the 7.1 sound feels a bit distant (likely how it creates the effect), but I am able to distinguish positioning a bit better, and do feel more immersed in the experience while active.<br /><br />Music is where the 7.1 really fails, and given that while gaming I'm typically either listening to music, or running a VOIP application, stereo is my preferred method of listening, however, the convenience of a toggle on the left ear makes it easy to switch modes in a pinch. Volume roller on this same ear is also great.<br /><br />The microphone on this device is excellent, probably the best I've used. It is very easy to position, very flexible, and extremely intuitive to mute by simply raising it up. There is also a mute button on the left ear, and a microphone mute light as well. I did not experience any feedback issues, as reported by some, however, it took a bit (given the number of \\"discovered\\" microphones on my system) to ensure I was actually speaking through this mic in my VOIP applications/etc. This may have been where other users have tripped up (my built-in laptop mic sounds HORRIBLE!).<br /><br />Aside from testing out some of the voice avatars, I have not even attempted to use any of the other features (G-Keys, saved configurations, etc) of this headset, so I cannot comment on those.<br /><br />My absolute favorite part of this headset is the fact that when you're low on a charge, you can simply plug it into the charging base via micro-USB. The design really is ingenious. This was my real draw to this headset over any other. This beats out a charging \\"cradle\\" by leaps and bounds as cradle chargers (while perhaps more aesthetically pleasing to the eye) require you to remove your headphones for (re-)charging when they are low/out. With these headphones, you can simply turn your wireless cans into wired without any interruptions. Battery life also claims to be 10 hours, and though I cannot confirm this, I've used these for about 6 hours without issue, and with the ease of the charge n' play battery is really not all that huge a concern.<br /><br />Construction also feels of quality, with the minor (personal) annoyance of \\"creaking\\" when bending/etc.<br /><br />Overall, despite being mildly let down due to the issues out of the box, the slight discomfort due to ear pressure/breathability, and sound bleeding, I would still totally recommend these to anyone.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy is like none other - I couldn't wait to read what would happen next!  There is an actual storyline that quickly develops and envelopes you as a reader.  I found myself constantly intrigued, often exasperated, but always hopeful for that 'happy ending' for which a true romantic wishes.  I must say that Fifty Shades trilogy has certainly captured the attention of women from all walks of life.  There is a caution I must advise:  Once you begin to read, nothing else will be accomplished until the entire series is completed!  Be ready for an adventure!
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|I have been looking forward to seeing this play for several years now, and was sadly disappointed by it. Andrew Lloyd Webber does not disappoint with his music, but the storyline leaves a lot to be desired. I will not spoil anything, but I find the story inconsistent with the original, which really bugged me because I love the original play so much. I also didn't care for half the characters (the actors in the cast were terrific--it was the characters themselves who were rather boring). If I could make this purchase again, I'd skip getting the DVD and just buy the soundtrack.

B005EGXTEE|5.0|The Hunger Games (book one of the hunger games trilogy) is amazing.  It's no wonder that pre-teens and teens around the world are flocking to take up archery.  I originally downloaded this book for my son, who described the storyline in pretty broad terms.  To be honest I didn't see how it could be a good story, but it turned out to be a real page turner!  Once I started on the first book, I had to read all three.  The hunger games trilogy has to be one of the best series I've read this year.

B001CDWFPC|5.0|This review is about the Kindle ESV Study Bible, not my opinions on the ESV version itself.  Although I do like the ESV version, it is not the only version of the Bible that I read.  I have tried other Kindle Bible versions and have not liked their format on the Kindle.  First, I could not always tell where I am at while reading, but on the ESV every chapter has the name of the book with the chapter number so I know where I am at with each chapter.  Second, going between books is difficult because I have to go back to the table of contents every time I wanted to switch books.  Third, not all of the Bibles have study notes on their Kindle version.  I love study bibles, but they are so heavy and bulky.  This is a great alternative because you can carry it easily and the footnotes and study notes are easy to get to and from.  It is also less expensive than the print versions at under $10!  So far this is my favorite Kindle Bible.  I'm not saying it is perfect, but it is pretty darn close for me.
B0087240Z4|1.0|It pains me to say it. I have been a fan since Gish and Siamese Dream came out - and I still consider those two albums to be some of the best ever published, by any band. But something has happened to Billy Corgan: a change of heart, a madness - or maybe he has nothing more to say as an artist, as a musician. Or maybe the original line up (up to 1993) had a magic of its own, and although Billy writes the songs, the atmosphere is gone, the melody is missing, the heart beats no more.<br /><br />Every single album published in the 1995-2012 period was a disappointment - no more, no less. There were a couple of good songs in Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995), two in Adore (1998), and since the year 2000 the Smashing Pumpkins have been musically dead. They continued to release albums in different formations, and obviously trying new things, new sound, but ultimately turning out the same bland, incoherent, nondescript mess.<br /><br />Gone is the tenderness and humanity, the sadness and awe of their first albums.<br /><br />They should just stop publishing and playing. Every man or woman, poem, blade of grass or shape of cloud has its bright day, and then its twilight.<br /><br />In art it is important to realize when to stop.<br /><br />Sometimes the time, the people, the hurt, the love is right, but artists do not realize that and believe it was because of THEM. They try to own the art, to possess it, to thrive off it. Only when they emulate it and are not successful, it starts to occur to them that maybe there was something more to it, something they did not fully understand. It did not matter at the time, since the result was right, but it starts to matter when incoherent, pretentious and nondescript 'works of art' start to appear, and only the public seems to notice that the old fire is gone.

B007J2TMQ0|5.0|What struck me hard in reading Beevor's in-depth book of history is the treatment of civilians on all sides as mere ants to be squashed. Because they could be squashed.<br /><br />I think of my mum and dad as children during the second world war. Watching in awe as the over paid, over sexed heroes of the American army marched down Queens Drive. \\"Any gum chum?\\" the scrawny kids would pester. With admiration.<br /><br />Beevor also picks out individual civilian anecdotes. The battles are told as they happened. From the east or west, this many of that type of tank, a general's army goes one way, another does something else. A compelling read. A book of well earned authority. I felt no bias in the facts being relayed to me. Only the unrelenting horror of a war that was made-up as it was going along. Each side trying to out-smart and out kill each other. Men who knew no better. Women left.<br /><br />I am resisting pointing out anything in particular. The Germans could have won the war. You can pick out for yourself decisive moments, decisions or indecisions. It is clear, however, that Nazi ideology infected the whole German population. Call it momentum if you like, but the will to support their despotic leader had no bounds. No conscience. No fear.
B000NOKERM|4.0|An excellent re-issue of this Coverdale/Sykes masterpiece, this is the album that introduced me to the \\"snakes\\" and what an impression it was! Their big hits 'here I go again\\" 'still of the night\\" and \\"is this love\\" is all here and accompanied by their promo video's along with live variations on DVD which suits me fine considering how hard it is to get this stuff here downunda in NZ (dont get me wrong: the album still sells, but the videos are hard to get here)<br />  The highlights for me apart from Coverdales voice and the highly commercial singles on this album,is John Sykes guitar work. he brings a tempo to this record that was absent from previous releases, I admire him for his work with both Tygers of Pan Tang and Thin Lizzy and gives this album it's distinction from other Whitesnake records. In my humble opinion it is their heaviest.<br />  What better way to renew your old copies if you are a long standing fan of this album, a must have if you are recently annointed one.
030758836X|2.0|When I finished this book, I wanted to give it one star, because it betrays the reader so much, but that wouldn't be fair, because the first half of the book is so gripping.  The author had no idea when to quit, and she's just wallowing in squalor by the end.  The main characters, who seemed pretty realistic at the beginning, have become unbelievable monsters.  A sad letdown.  I'd feel like a better person if I hadn't read it.
B000LPS3B2|4.0|The tale of a belated haunting.  Years after the fact, a restless spirit decides to get even with those who \\"wronged\\" her.  Why she waited so long is never questioned so don't expect an answer.  This angry specter just suddenly pops up, mostly in poor photography, but sometimes in the flesh (so to speak), and begins to wreck havoc on those responsible for her sorry state.  As revenge killings go, this one was pretty lax; most of the deaths were simply mentioned as hearsay, late in the game.  For a spirit bent on reprisal, this one was pretty lazy going about it.  Things don't start getting anxious until the last third of the movie.  I found that to be the greatest drawback with this story, that, and the fact that the one person who knew everything carried on as though totally clueless (which made him either stupid or an incredible liar).<br />Most of the \\"scares\\" are of the jump variety, only a couple of scenes were actually frightening.  I did love the final showdown though, and the chilling image of a spectral albatross.  That was truly inventive.  All in all, not a bad little ghost story.
B005723JSQ|3.0|What has caused Poppy Wyatt to pose as a singing telegram to a Japanese business man and don reindeer gloves in April? Well, she lost her engagement ring, and her cell phone got stolen, so she has no way of being contacted if someone does find the ring. That is until she finds a perfectly good phone in the trash. Since she refuses to return the phone until she finds her ring, she inadvertently becomes the personal assistant to one Sam Roxton. Then she promptly ruins his life. Well, kinda.<br /><br />Poppy suffers from \\"do before you think\\" syndrome, which makes her extremely unlikeable, but also gets her into some quite funny situations. She sends out lots of e-mails posing as Sam \\"trying to help\\" but really she get caught up, goes overboard, and gets Sam into all kinds of messes. It was a bit over-the-top, even for Chick Lit, but it was still fun to read.<br /><br />I much preferred the second half of the book to the first. It has a slightly more serious tone as it deals with sabotage to Sam's business and issues regarding Poppy's upcoming wedding. Poppy and Sam find themselves being the most equipped to help each other work through their problems after having shared a phone number for some time. It was very cute watching their relationship develop. This was my first Sophie Kinsella novel, and I quite enjoyed it. The first half is probably a 2 star read, but the second half is easily a 4. I'll definitely be checking out more of her books.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me was the footnotes. This isn't a fault with the book itself, since I like the fun extras that footnotes provide, but they do not work for Kindle edition. Clicking back and forth from the current page to the end of the chapter is not convenient, and reading all of the notes at once at the end just doesn't make sense. If you want to get the most out of this one, get a physical copy so that the footnotes are actually at the foot of the page. I'm sure I missed a lot by skipping them.

The game is very enjoyable and I prefer it to the various \\"find the object\\" puzzle games.

B0080BFWAE|5.0|I eagerly anticipated the Blu-ray release date of one of my all time favorite movies, Adventures in Babysitting.  I just finished watching it and felt compelled to see if others had left feedback on Amazon.  It turns out, they had and I couldn't agree more with what's being said.  My copy of the Blu-ray disc is really grainy (picture the vintage white noise on your screen) and the audio is sub-par at best.  I find myself turning it up to hear the dialog and turning it down because the music is too loud.  The rest of my Blu-ray and DVDs don't have this problem.<br /><br />About the picture.  I don't speak geek but I can tell you that there a some spots that are definitely worse than others.  Some are just downright awful.  Not at all what I expected.  Yes, this movie is 25 years old, but I've seen movies this old, and even older, transfer to Blu-ray better than this.  I have both the DVD and Blu-ray and I think I will reach for the DVD version going forward.  This disc is just disappointing all the way around.  No extras, plain blue disc with no real graphics or anything on it-just writing.  And I agree with another reviewer that something labeled \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\" warrants SOME kind of special treatment.  Interviews, commentary, trailers, behind the scenes footage, SOMETHING.  This disc has NOTHING.<br /><br />I guess I should have realized that with such a low price point (to start), I wasn't going to get much.  I did, however, expect a decent picture and great sound, of which I got neither.<br /><br />5 stars for the movie, 0 stars for the Blu-ray

0738727326|4.0|Love, love, love this deck!! I currently have three decks but I anticipate using this one most often. The images on the cards are absolutely beautiful; they're gracefully intricate and each card has its own particular mood. They fit perfectly in my hands and have a great energy. Usually my hands are too small and thin to properly shuffle cards but I'm finding these really easy to shuffle. As of now, I have only done a one card reading on myself but I'm so looking forward to doing some readings on friends and family. I was fortunate enough to meet Barbara Moore and I can tell you she puts her heart and soul into the descriptions of the cards so I will definitely be buying the book that accompanies the cards but the little booklet that comes with the deck is useful and, of course, very well written.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really liked this book, if you can like about a book about a child murderer. My book club thought it was reminiscent of \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin,\\" which dealt with an much more disturbed child. The thing about books like this is that it is every parent's worse nightmare and every one can feel, \\"What if!\\" It also leads to discussions of other child raising issues, the distructiveness of denial, and the ever interesting nature vs. nurture theme. I thought the character of the parents was drawn very well and the ending heartbraking.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I'm not going to give a summary of the book. You can read the blurb anywhere.<br /><br />It is a good book. It's not all happy and cheesy and fun. Don't get me wrong, there's some good humor in it. But, it's a little dark and there's a lot of sad parts. But that's life.<br /><br />I loved the book and the sequel.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Having never written a review before I felt something should be said against all the complaining done against the last two books of the series.  Perhaps originally this was to be a triology, but has evolved into something more.  I have enjoyed all five books and have read them all in about a month's time.  I'm sure I'll re-read them all to digest them more slowly though.  I'm glad for the last two books as it has given me a more clear picture of the East; their mindset and customs and importantly where and what kind of place Daenerys is coming from.  I am also wondering about Varys and Illyrian who appear to be minor characters, but am curious if they'll be revealed to be great \\"puppet masters\\" as they influence and manipulate all the higher ups, both East and West, as they seem to have been doing for quite a long time.  Also I keep coming up that for a bunch of children &teenagers; Jon, Sansa, Bran, Arya, Daenerys, Aegon, have all the normal traits of being children and young adults even though they've been placed in positiions better suited for adults.  They're very young, and wishy washy, changing thier minds on a whim frequently; except for Bran who seems to have accepted his fate to be the next Greenseer; but that remains to be seen.  One of my favorite characters, Arya, I feel much sympathy for.  She has suffered much for a 10-11 year old; she's seen her father beheaded, been in the midst of several battles, has seen and been a part of way too much butality in her short life so far, especially from the older men who have been in charge of and around her.  I am not surprised that she finds facination with the God of Many Faces (a death god) and is learning to be an assassin.  I feel she is struggling to overcome her fear of being helpless surrounded by so much violence and seeks to have control of it. In addition to Arya, I love reading about Daenerys (Dany)who has also suffered much for a young girl; although differently from Arya.  Jon and Bran are others I'minterested to see how their lives unfold, and I'm still waiting to find out what happens to little Rickon, Jon's half brother, and Sansa, her sister, who is the total opposite and has suffered much violence and the brutal intrigues of the royal court.<br />So far, this seems an epic tale, and epic tales take much time to tell.  I hope that with onset of the HBO shows this story does not become screen plays to feed the Cable network.  It's my opinion that HBO should have waited until the story is finished being told before starting a \\"TV series\\".  I should also say that these books of George R R Martin's are the first I've read from this author and because of them I may read some of his other titles while waiting for his next book in the Song of Ice and Fire series.

B007ELN8Y8|4.0|Maybe my expectations were too high. I was eager to see this film as I've had several people recommend it to me as they know I'm knowledgeable about silent film history. While I applaud the tremendous risk the filmmakers took to make a silent film in the 21st century, there were two things that bothered me.<br /><br />First, the style was a strange mishmash. It's as though The Artist was made in the 1940s with the purpose of depicting the silent era. Much of the set design, fonts, etc. are more reminiscent of the 40s era in Hollywood history than the silent film era. That's not to say I didn't like it. The 1940s in American film are an a fascinating era, and I love its style. Still, I had to wonder if the filmmakers knew much about film history.<br /><br />Second, the story is hackneyed and not compelling. The characters lacked complexity, and though the performances were quite good I never felt involved or concerned with what might happen to them (except for the adorable dog).<br /><br />The best thing about this film is that its success has hopefully made it easier for filmmakers to take chances and produce cinema that challenges.

B00026WU9Q|4.0|Dylan's \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" is a sweet recall to yester-year. Though I was not alive during its original production, the twangy sounds and folk rhythm of Dylan's early caricatures and tones are present here as they would have been in local fairs and spring town festivals. After watching a YouTube video of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" I hope to find a sound that replicated the stage and aura, and his album continues to do just that track after track. A must for any music enthusiast and fans of a great musician as well, \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" certainly adds a unique and necessary component to this American music fan's library.
1606863622|5.0|Great book Mister Sparks.<br /><br />It desperately needs a sequel.<br /><br />You have made sequels before.<br /><br />Lets face it Tim is in remission and we know where that usually leads to.<br /><br />The ending of the movie, was awful, he just pops up and they embrace. Your readers know that the alternate ending on the DVD is the real ending of the book.<br /><br />Just think what you could do for a sequel with your vast talent.<br />I suspect that a sequel would be a smashing success with your fans.[[ASIN:1606863622 Dear John]]
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun but I would like more levels. I have caught my self playing for hours at a t8e and consequently running out of levels.
B008JH5FZ6|4.0|Although it's not as good as the last Die Hard movie, this is, in my opinion, better than \\"Escape from New York\\". I really liked Guy Pearce. I found him to be a lot more amusing than Kurt Russell's character - Snake Plissken. Definitely more sardonic. The only issue people might have is the number of F-bombs in this UNRATED version of the film.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is a \\"B-movie\\" filled with scary-violent secondary characters, a witty, sarcastic leading man, a hang-over written plot and not-so-great CGI, but it's still better than a lot of B grade space movies in recent years and even some A grade space movies.<br /><br />My \\"Minecraft\\" guru, slightly geeky, 14-year-old nephew said he liked it a lot, so definitely a winner with teen boys.<br /><br />In the end, it is a bit of a fun time out for your brain.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It is just as highly paced and intriguing. The book takes place about halfway through the second season of the HBO series, but if you think half of a book can't possibly have too much going on...you would be wrong. Highly recommend it if you have only watched the tv series so far or if you have been reading the books. Great read!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I purchased this processor, as the I7 series were out of my budget. This works well for my needs and runs pretty fast and cool. With [[ASIN:B005O65JXI Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO CPU Cooler (RR-212E-20PK-R2)]], my processor runs at 28C. That's pretty cool to me, not creating that much heat. I mostly game and multitask on my desktop and this fit my needs perfectly. I purchased this through Amazon.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|The first time I listened to this album, it didn't really catch me.  But it caught me more on the second listen.  And the third.  Now it is creeping its way up the ladder towards the top for me.  Fiona's vocals have grown a bit scratchier which I find only adds to the intensity of her music.  The lyrics are deep and dark and the sound of the songs is dissonant and beautiful.  I can understand why this album is not appealing to some of the people who had particular hopes or expectations about this latest album, but I found that, by listening with an open mind, I really enjoyed following along with the latest journey she has crated.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I usually read a lot of mystery/thrillers, but this was a thriller of a different kind.  This was a great ending to another kind of happily ever after.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I loved everything about this movie. It's hard for me not to love something that Ryan Gosling is in. He's a phenomenal actor. This movie had me on the edge of my seat, and I actually jumped up and shouted during several scenes. The scene on the beach gave me chills.

0439023521|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite book series and my favorite book out of the series. I read this right when it came out and could not get enough of it. I have read the book twice and seen the movie twice. It's such an impacting story. I love how it is for all ages. Well adults and teens. I think it's a little too graphic for young kids. The story is exciting and new and keeps you on your toes the whole time. The story is unlike anything I've ever heard or imagined. Its fake but yet seems so real and could possibly happen. It's such an extravagant story and makes me wonder hoe the author came up with all these details. It's a story about the future, which is totally up my alley, but it's not just the typical futuristic, world-ending story. Its much more tan that. It's a twist on the future. About power, control, punishment, and entertainment. The typical rich get richer and poor get poorer motto. Although it takes place in the future part of it feels like the olden days. It has everything packed into this book. Drama, love, action, thrill, and adventure all make up this obsessive story. It's more than I ever thought it would ever be. It really pulls you into the story and at some points I even wished it were real. You get sucked in and don't want to put it down. I think I read the book in about 6 days. My favorite part in the book is the actual \\"hunger games\\". Its such a neat concept. It's cruel but powerful and goes into so much detail. The detail is what really gets me. Everything about this world and the games are strict and clean. There is a reason for everything and everything has a place. Everything in the world is so precise and creative and that is really portrayed in the book so that you can imagine it in your mind. After finishing the series and seeing the movie I became even more enthralled and went out and bought the extra books. Books that go into more detail about the world of the hunger games and the characters. The characters are amazing! They each have their own background story of how they became the person they are today. They are each so different but all blend together and connect with one another. Its almost like they fit like a puzzle. They play off each other and lean on one another and even fight and kill for one another. Its such a powerful story because even though Katniss and the rest of the poor districts are over powered by the rich, they take a stand and fight for their rights. They are treated like crap, yet stay so strong and continuing doing their best so that they don't lose. There is not one thing in this book that I didn't like. Not to mention that its an easy read and everything is understandable and portrayed in a simple relaxed way.
0307913147|5.0|I do not often write reviews, but I felt that this deserved some credit. This book is great. It is a fun scifi romp with crazy 80s pop culture references galore. I grew up in the 80s and I was a geek so I got almost all of the references whether explained or not. I think this added greatly to how much I enjoyed this novel. I highly recommend this book especially for those who meet the criteria of uber 80's geek.
B0000A5A0T|5.0|One of my favorite John Coltrane album. I can't describe how beautiful and wonderful this album is.<br />If you're a big fan of Coltrane's and If you're an old hand at Jazz like me, you need to own this CD..
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|Sure LP changed its style and its music is not the same as Meteora and Hybrid Theory, but this album is not bad at all.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very well written, I could not put the book down it keeps you reading for sure, I am on book 3 now and I don't look forward to it finishing. Book two was very good,<br /> I recommend all three books.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Nothing more to say except it was the best trilogy I have read in a long time! Easy reading, different, entertaining and can not wait to see the movie.
0553386794|5.0|I started reading this before I watched the show, then I put it down after the first two chapters and watched the show.  I picked the book back up after watching season 2 and even though I know what happens in this book because of the show it was much easier to read because I picture the actors from the show.<br /><br />My favorite characters have to be Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and Arya Stark. The characters worlds are so detailed and weaved so tightly that it is hard to find anything amiss with the story.  Like the watching the series I feel like I could read the book over and over.  This is just a story filled with awesomeness and I have just started it.  I am both excited and fearful what is to come to these characters. I have read many people find the book has too many characters to follow that is why I say too seriously watch season 1 at least.  I have the second book Clash of Kings but may not get to it for a while.
0141439793|4.0|Jane Austen. Some people like her, other people hate her. (At least, that's what I got from the writing.) Northanger Abbey is apparently the most cheerful and lighthearted of her novels, dealing with Catherine Morland, a young naive lady, who goes to Bath, and experiences fashionable society for the first time. She meets many new friends: Isabella, who shows her Gothic romances, and Henry and Eleanor Tilney, who invite her to their father's house, Northanger Abbey. \\"There, influenced by novels of horror and intrigue, Catherine comes to imagine terrible crimes committed by General Tilney, risking the loss of Henry's affection, and has to learn the difference between fiction and reality, false friends and true. With its broad comedy and irrepressible heroine, Northanger Abbey is the most youthful and optimistic of Jane Austen's works.\\" (Penguin Books.) I definitely enjoyed the light tone and writing of Austen, but (as I said early), I can definitely imagine how some people would not like it all. She wrote even before Charles Dickens, and yet her style is much less overwritten, with not many adjectives (Dickens is stuffed with them.) Austen's style is a sort gossipy tone; the young ladies talking among themselves about various happenings. Henry Tilney was a really great character, really likable. I liked the book overall a lot; it was quite a contrast from other literature from around that time, is definitely a readable classic for most people. Northanger Abbey was published posthumously right after her death.<br /><br />You can read all of my reviews at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com.
B007SGM084|5.0|Best book/trilogy I have ever read! Highly addicting! Many people thing it is a book all about sex but it really has a great love story too. You will fall in love with Christian Grey!
0345528581|2.0|This book is a good place for a person new to body-weight exercises, but in my opinion there are better books on the subject.  If you have a history of working out (my case 21 years) you will find nothing new in this book. In my opinion Convict Conditioning and the Naked Warrior are superior products that cover the same material in a more complete manner.  Save your money for Convict Conditioning.

B007I0RA26|5.0|Originally reviewed at: [...]<br />Rating: 5 out of 5 biscuits<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children has been on my wishlist for quite a long time so when I was contacted by the publisher and was sent a review copy, I couldn't wait to get started. What made me want to pick it up in the first place was the fact that it's so different from everything else out there. It's illustrated with vintage photographs of peculiar children who might seem really creepy at first but their presence makes perfect sense once you're reading the story. To be honest, I sort of expected something darker but it turned out to be completely different. It's rather a mysterious adventure than a creepy horror story - but unputdownable all the same.<br /><br />The first part of the novel is set in the United States - Jacob tells the story of his childhood and the stories his grandfather used to tell him when he was a kid. Stories about a levitating girl, an invisible boy, a boy who was able to lift a boulder, and bizarre tales about monsters who were after him - and of course, no one believed him. Jacob's grandpa was actually one of my favourite characters from the book. I loved the fact that even Jacob didn't believe him initially. Then, as he sets out on a journey to Wales in order to uncover the truth and he reveals some vital secrets, he gradually realises how wrong he'd been. And not only did his grandpa have to live in a world where he could never feel safe, he had to live with the fact that no one (including his family) would believe him. I felt really sorry for him.<br /><br />With Jacob leaving Florida, there comes a shift in the story. Just like the weather which goes from bright and sunny to cold and rainy, the story's atmosphere turns sinister and quite haunting as well. From a suburban family drama we're transported into a whole new world - a world full of secrets, a world where bizarre creatures and levitating children do exist. For us readers, this second half of the novel seems to be like marmite - you either love it, or you hate it. I've heard several people say they didn't like this shift in the story and the fact that it's so different from how the story started out. And I do agree with them to a certain extent - it is different. It really is. But I think the tricky part is to keep in mind that it's all fiction. Forget that the book started out like an everyday story about an everyday high school boy - it's fantasy. And it did work for me.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't particularly like was how easily Jacob gives up his whole life and says goodbye to his family in the second half of the novel. The fact that he doesn't really hesitate or worry about the consequences of his decision but sticks with those people whom he met only a few days previously was the only thing that I found highly unrealistic (even for fantasy). Having said that, it really is a gripping story.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is a must-have for young-adults and adults alike. It's something that will make you want to keep on reading late at night and something that will no doubt stay with you for a long time.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|Read book over 2 evenings, could not put down. Best book I have ever read on the subject.  No secret selling, only well thought out logic.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Asia's last three albums (including this one) since they reformed have been excellent.  Real music, real melodies, real hooks, smart lyrics- all things lacking with the garbage being cranked out to the masses today.  This CD might be the best of the three since they reformed.  There are more radio-friendly songs on this one than the other two and the production is tight.  The best album I have heard in 2012, for sure.
B0013N4AT0|5.0|In my opinion Still Life is Opeth's best record.  Sure, it's not as heavy as say MAYH or Deliverance, but musically it is the most complete and dynamic. It opens with the 11 minute epic \\"the Moor\\" which absolutely blew me away upon first listen and will cement the listeners interest in the rest of the album.  Blending with the excellent instrumentation is Akerfeldt's ever resilient and impressive songwriting.  Calling the words \\"song lyrics\\" is a bit of a simplification, it's profound poetry, and the fact that such poetic English verses are coming from a Swedish band just further adds to the brilliance of the songs.  If you have any doubt that this is their best, then listen to the 5.0 Surround Sound Mix, it will change your life! This album is a masterpiece, nuff said!
1436196329|4.0|My son loved the Wimpy Kid books and he likes to listen to CD's when he goes to bed.  He has listened to this one nonstop since he received it for his birthday.  I guess it's a hit.  Cute, silly story.  Perfect for a 7 year old.

B007C3TVNA|5.0|This movie is indeed a good adaptation of the Novel,'We Need To Talk About Kevin' by Lionel Shriver.I have read the Novel and it haunted me long after reading.I wanted a visual to the story and this movie did do the job well.Lynne Ramsay has done the movie smartly without missing most details.Era Mirza and Tilda Swinton performances are spell binding.I enjoyed watching the movie.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|More sex in the characters' week than in my life time, but it was a fun read and I enjoyed the characters. There are a few 'as if' moments, but I did really enjoy meeting Christian and Ana. I swiftly read through all the three books and in the end the sex was a little boring and seemed like maybe the author was over it too, but like I said, I enjoyed the romp :)
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I thought it was very poorly written and found the whole idea of dominance upsetting.  I kept hoping the characters would change.  I did hear that book 2 is much better but I've had my fill and not interested in any further books by this author.  Need to read something uplifting and happy.

0062060562|4.0|I read this book on the avid insistence of a friend, and I am sure glad I read this book. The premise is quite intriguing - a woman with a very unique type of amnesia in which she wakes up every morning not remembering anything from as much as several decades of her life. What is most interesting is that sometimes she wakes thinking she is a child, while others she believes she is a young adult. There is no predicting at what believed age she will be when she wakes, and no controlling it.<br />A few things bugged me about the plot, the first of which was that on the mornings that she was supposed to wake as a child, nothing in her behavior indicated that of a child - she still behaved the same as when she woke as a full-grown adult. I was also immediately suspicious of Ben, as his behavior towards her did not seem very motivated towards achieving a return of her memory- but I suppose that was the point.<br />Despite Christine's loss of memory, in many ways her actions are instinctual - which is very realistic and made for some tense scenes. A Dr. Nash comes to her aid in secret, both because her case is no unusual and because he really does want to help her. Despite the difficulties of Christine not remembering him from day-to-day, he is still able to make progress with her - all behind Ben's back. On his advice, Christine begins  keeping a journal of each day, as well as what memories return to her. This is when the book really picks up in intensity, as Christine comes to realize that her own mind could be her own worst enemy. At times she is not even certain if she can trust the words in her journal, since she cannot remember writing them.<br />As she fills up her journal, she begins to uncover lies and secrets in her life that create nail-biting, mind-blowing scenes that had me riveted. I was a little disappointed with how the book ends - after all of the build up, it seemed almost anti-climactic. Other than that, the book was an excellent read, especially for a first-time author. Everyone should read this book!first-time author. Everyone should read this book!
B0083GNOYW|5.0|Oh my gosh, I love this show! I love all of the characters - they never fail to make me laugh. I can't believe HIMYM has been on the air for so many seasons, and I'm glad because I don't know what I would do without it. Don't miss this season finale. You will NOT be disappointed!
B00846REIS|3.0|I read this book right after I finished the fifty shades trilogy. Some have said that it was just like fifty shades. There were some of the same character qualities between the two leading men, but as a whole the books are not the same. I found it entertaining, but not sure if I like it as well as fifty shades. I will hopefully form more of an opinion after read the next book.

0307887448|5.0|I read it twice in a week. Great nerd culture references. The story makes it hard to put down! Just read it! It's worth it!
1468161660|5.0|Truthfully, the one and only reason I ordered this book was bc I heard the characters were TAB fans, and because I was curious how a virtually unknown author at the time could have so many five stars. I was super skeptical bc I can never get into fiction books, even the ones that became huge successes like the whole Twilight series (which I hated).<br /><br />That being said, I read this book and the sequel in two days. I would've read them in one, but I had to wait to order the second one. This is now my favorite book (books if you count the sequel), and it had nothing to do with TAB being in each chapter. Although, I must say that was definitely icing on the cake.<br /><br />So kudos Colleen, I can't wait for the third to come out. :)
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|When I first heard of Frank Ocean, I mistakenly labeled him as a typical middle class R&B singer, somewhere between Miguel and Trey Songz. After listening to \\"channel ORANGE\\", I know that this is not your average R&B artist.<br /><br />At first listen, \\"channel ORANGE\\" might catch you off guard. Frank Ocean uses a very different way of telling stories on this album. Each song plays like different scenes from a stage play with Frank Ocean as the narrator, allowing the audience to follow his stories. (Think of the \\"Trapped In The Closet\\" series) This album is meant to be followed from beginning to end to get the full story. On the very good into song \\"Thinkin Bout You\\", he sounds like a one man music group singing in three different tones. There is an interesting connection between the live standout song \\"Sweet Life\\" and the Elton John sampled \\"Super Rich Kids\\". The message you will have to hear for yourself. The 10 minute long \\"Pyramids\\" starts off real shaky with a techno driven beat. But near the middle it slows down to a slow groove that makes it very listenable. (But not great) He flirts with a lot of different sounds on this album. You can vividly hear hip hop, soul, jazz, rock synthesizers, finger snaps, a John Mayer guitar solo and a Playstation , sometimes all on one song.  You can even hear a crowd chant similar to the one on \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" in the background of \\"Pink Matter\\".<br /><br />After listening to the first 10 tracks, the word classic came to mind. Then the filer songs come in. \\"Lost\\" is kind of weird to me. And \\"Monks\\" lost me. His conversation with a taxi driver on \\"Bad Religion\\" puts a spin on a relationship, comparing his love to a cup filled with cyanide. (Still a solid track) At times this album is so spacey that sometimes I got lost in the words and couldn't understand the connection. His analogies were confusing to me on \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"Sierre Leone\\". Of course he brings it all back with the excellent Andre 3stacks assisted \\"Pink Matter\\". It starts off sounding like an average slow jam until half way through when the beat kicks in and Mr. Benjamin rips off a verse that makes you want to dust off your \\"Aquemini\\" CD. Very smooth track.<br /><br />This album is truly original in all kinds of ways. Even though the lyrics and metaphors can be a reach at times. Its impressive that this album is not only critically praised but also selling like hotcakes despite little radio airplay. Very few artists are given the freedom to make the album they want to make. Frank Ocean is unchallenged in his style. The only sound I could compare him too today is Kid Cudi. (He even sounds like him on a couple songs) This is the best, original debut R&B album I heard since Lyfe Jennings. Its interesting that Andre 3000 guest on this album because a lot of this album reminds me of \\"The Love Below\\". Some artist are either afraid to or not allowed to take risk. Frank Ocean knows the risk he is taking. This risk is proof that originality is not dead. This originality is what makes this the album of the year.  AMatter\\".

1416550550|5.0|A fantastic work of historical fiction.  Several very compelling character's stories between late 1800's to present day Australia and England, brilliantly wound together as a grand-daughter tries to unravel the mystery of her beloved late grandmother Nell's beginnings.  I literally could not put this down until 3am!  It really takes you back into the times and places of the characters.  2 friends I loaned it to also could not put it down either. Because the story jumps around between times and places it can be a little confusing at first so I'd recommend jotting down the characters' name, time period, and relationship to the main character until you're so wound up in their lives they feel like your own long lost family ;)  The mystery of Nell's story will keep you guessing until the very end!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Everytime I thought I had it figured out I was wrong. This book is appropriate for young adults & not so young.
0061537969|5.0|This is a beautiful story filled with example after example of the extraordinary power of love, devotion and the strength of the human spirit in the face of obstacles. Full of wisdom, insight, and use of racing metaphors, the author weaves a story that deeply touches the heart. Like life itself, I laughed, cried and was left wanting more.  You don't gave to be a dog lover, a fan of car racing, or particularly spiritual in nature to enjoy this lovely work. It just makes you want to believe in believing. I enjoyed it thoroughly!
B0053YGYO4|4.0|Another great album from Coldplay, probably not as good as viva la vida, but this album really dose not deserve the criticism it gets, if any other band put out a album half as good it would be called a classic. Coldplay have set such a high mark with viva la vida I douth they will be able to break it.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|This was a wonderful movie. I lost track of time while watching it. Kept me on the edge of my seat and I was trying to guess how it would end. The ending surprised me. I would have never figured out what was going on. I would recommend this to anyone! But it is somewhat long, so keep that in mind before watching it.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Yes indeed, the old master is back with a great new album and it's one of his best. Dealing with teams such as love, sex, religion and so on. It has all the makings of a classic Leonard Cohen album. The man rocks...
B005D0RDKW|1.0|the CD never worked in 3 players, when i returned the product i was going to re-purchase, but returning it i was never told it wqas there. i followed the cd the following said the cd was there, you never returned my money, i had to call someone at your number and she gave me a hard time. im not buying another cd from you. ty
B003O86FMW|5.0|Captivating. Could not put down and made me so ready to discover what is next in the final book. I feel this book in the trilogy was more exciting and the plot had more turns of events that kept you hanging on until the end.
1416955070|5.0|I don't write long reviews, but I've read all 5 books and they are one of my favorite series...I like easy reads that are relaxing to me and also exciting...it's worth the time...
B0056C6XIA|3.0|For forty bucks it's just okay - not great. If you want a reliable multi-tool, stick with Leatherman. It is truly better to spend the extra money for the better product; especially, if it's a gift for someone else.
0307744434|5.0|Night Circus is one of the best books I have read recently.  It is creative, filled with twists and turns and surprises.Sometimes I actually open the book and read a chapter or two in the middle of the night, just for the delight. (and I am not an insomniac!)
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I was using a different pdf annotater before that was such a hassle...my place in the document was never saved and opening large files took forever. I love the annotating functions in this app and the search and note functions. It's just great for navigating through my class materials. and for $1.99 it will be easier to study and less of a headache than the other free demo app I was using.
B0000AI45P|5.0|I've been revisiting Marquee Moon recently, and it sounds better than ever! Great guitar playing, but the drums and bass are worthy support. I love these guys. It really is one of the underrated great albums, and I'm really glad to have it in my collection. I love Tom Verlaine's strangled vocals too!
B006LSZECO|5.0|this book was full of twists and turns.  the bad thing about reading it is that it is hard to find another book this good.
0812993292|5.0|I grabbed the audiobook for this from the library thinking it looked like a pretty interesting story and the very next day I saw it was on the list of nominees for the 2012 Man Booker Prize.  Since I tend to enjoy their nominees I was even more interested in reading this book.<br /><br />Harold is retired and living with his wife Maureen is a tidy little house in a small town.  Their lives are very mundane until the morning that Harold gets a letter from Queenie Hennessy.  Her letter says that she has terminal cancer and she's saying goodbye.  Harold struggles to write her back and when he realizes that his letters do not adequately convey how he feels he decides that he is going to walk across England and tell her in person.<br /><br />Harold sets out on his journey completely unprepared.  He learns to rely on the kindness of strangers along the way.  His story is picked up by the media and spread through social media.  Then his starts picking up Pilgrims, followers on his journey.<br /><br />I loved this book.  I'm sure it'll make my Top 10 Favorites of this year.  I loved Harold and I even loved Maureen once I got to understand her.  I suspect a lot of people married for a long time will see some of themselves in Harold and Maureen.  I can't recommend this book enough!  Go read it!  Now!
1468161660|5.0|I just have to say... I was so impressed by this book!!!!  One minute I was crying.. the next I was laughing. My son was looking at me wondering what in the world was wrong with me so I  read him parts from the book \\"would you rather\\" (something him and I do)... it was just a great book I finished it in one evening!!!!  The emotions that were brought on by this book!!! To learn about the devastating news that Lake has to hear and face...I too have been in her shoes... and I just loved loved loved this book!!!!  Readers beware.... have tissues in hand... and an empty badder :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Like the first book, this book is also very addictive, the story continues and you just can't stop reading. The unexpected twists and the suspension keeps you wanting more. Loved it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an amazing Bible app. It has everything that you need to have. you can download multiple versions, you can use various highlights, and read devotionals! I love it.<br /><br />get it now!
B001H9JBW6|4.0|The frightening world of the general population under constant surveillance and general government control is upon us.  This series should serve as a warning that you can't gain safety by giving your freedom away.  This is a well acted story about too much power being given to government along with the technology that gives it total control over us.  This seems to be the road we're headed down, a brave new world indeed, where we find out that the last enemy is us.... we're almost there.
B007PVHANM|5.0|This is one of the best documentaries that I have seen in years. The Special features are also interesting to watch.I would say that anyone who is interested in reggae music should watch this movie.
B005LAIH54|3.0|Good movie,a few frozen scenes,but ok for used dvd,to much trouble too exchange,don't watch it that much,ok for the kifs
B008VOHQNQ|5.0|I bought the season just to watch this episode and it was definitely worth it ! I'd recommend this to anyone !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read..the story is fantastic and the characters are amazing. This book kept me at the edge of my seat, a real page turner I couldn't wait to find out what happened next..couldn't let it down. Once I had finshed this book I bought the second book within seconds..truly additive..you just don't want the story to end. Loved it !!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is good,  but its (in my opinion) not great. okay you get this you have so many games unlocked and then you have to unlock the rest...I would rather have them all unlocked from the start.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Not a big gamer I just found this on a daily free app and tried it.  Lots of fun.<br />Not hard.... Just easy fun.
B00005MKA1|5.0|Takes me down sweet memory lane, I just looove Bob Marley. I know this is the 2nd time I've purchased this same CD.
B0060CX8F6|4.0|I bought this movie for my 3 year old niece. Despite what I feel about the movie, she loves it! She has watched it over and over and over. My niece is afraid of just about anything that has to do with darkness or monsters. I was a little amprehensive about allowing her to watch the movie. While she admits to not liking the \\"Shadow Man\\", she continues watching the movie and does not seem as afraid of him anymore. She had realized it is just a movie and she can watch the parts about the \\"Shadow Man\\" without getting upset. I do admit that the graphics could have been better. I purchased the movie and have been playing it on my IPAD. Some of the graphics come up blurry. I do not know if this is because it is on an IPAD. Disney does need to step it up a little bit. I liked the fact that I could expose my niece to characters not usually seen on tv (African-American princess). The movie could have been more colorful instead of dark and dreary during many parts of the movie. There were a few sterotypes that could have been avoided.
B004W4N55C|2.0|Seems to be an ok app. But cannot perform any search of any kind. Force Closes every time. Nexus 7.
B008MEM24S|5.0|That game is pretty fun. I play it on my phone all the time. Kids like it too. Its for all the family.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app that helps to pass time. it's very addictive when trying to beat a game. the best part is that you earn coins no matter what. I like that you don't have to spend actual money like some other games. my coworkers and I really enjoy trying to beat each others scores.
B000IFQLBE|4.0|Cd is what you would expect, great classics, updated live tunes, a great collection. If you are tired of the original versions the total live set is a refreshing change.
B0057J72OG|5.0|If you've listened to the radio in the last two years, you've heard just about every song on the vocal album of Nothing but the Beat. This album is pure gold. I've spent hours listening to both the vocal and electronic albums since i picked this product up about a month ago. Well worth the money.<br /><br />I listen to all my vinyl on an 80s? turntable through my father's mid 80s Pioneer stereo system. The record sounds great. The warmth of vinyl mixed with a kicking house beat.
1433503956|5.0|Bought this for my teenage son who is very happy with this bible.  He enjoys the simplicity of the version and all of the information in the footnotes, cross references, historical facts, etc.  Would recommend this bible to anyone who is looking for a study bible with a easy translation.
1451627297|1.0|King's story is meandering and narcoleptic. James Ellroy came up with the notion of a tour<br />de force novel about the Kennedy assassination with his American trilogy series. It may be as fanciful<br />as King's book, but at least Ellroy's machine gun staccato style grips you and won't let you go. I really<br />had to force myself to finish King's book. Heavy slogging for limited payoff.
B0089IGUP4|5.0|If you are not familar with Gaslight Anthem, I would label their sound as Bruce Springsteen meets the Clash having listened to the Del Fuegos. For those of you who are fans, Handwritten is a great album that shows continued growth in their songwriting and playing (I don't know if Brian Fallon's singing has sounded better). From the radio ready sound of \\"45\\" and the title track to the Guthrie-like \\"National Anthem\\" Gaslight Anthem expand their musical range successfully while still managing to keep a straight ahead rock and roll energy. This album makes me think they might be ready to take up the mantle as new \\"Only American Band That Matters\\" which has been languishing since the demise of The Replacements.
0345803507|5.0|I loved the entire trilogy and could not put the books down!  It has been a while since I read a book that kept my attention the entire time.  I need more!
B008EL4YX6|5.0|this is the best game I ever played it really is brain teaser but I'm not going to give it away you have to whach and see your self?
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Amazon<br /><br />I loved this book.  We were all beginners once with external packs loaded to the gills.  I've just completed a backpack in the Kings Canyon region and I was slow as molasses.  Now, back from the backpack I am hiking with weight for the next backpack.  I would love to do the PCT someday.  The author of this book gave me inspiration.  Thank you Amazon for the Kindle edition.<br /><br />Tranina
0985081821|5.0|I truly loved it! I hate to wait for the next book in a series, so I debated starting a brand new series, but I am SO GLAD I DID! I read the little historical offering on the website while I waited for my paperback to arrive and was very pleased with the amazing level of world-building that Rebecca has done. I devoured the e-book 'Her Sweetest Downfall'! DON'T MISS THAT! It was also WONDERFUL! I look forward to MANY years of these great and powerful women!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This gives a great backstory we never got on the original series or<br />followup movies, even if it's an alternate from what the original<br />series was based on.  Still Kirk and Spock manage to improve a<br />bad situation while forming a friendship.  Kirk's solution to the<br />\\"no win\\" academy test is revealed in detail and you'll never guess<br />who wrote the test.  Almost as funny as \\"The Voyage Home\\" !
B001992NUQ|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I went into without any idea what it was about. After the credits rolled I left without any idea what life was about. There's lots to love about this movie, from the fight sequences to the back stories and even the scenes without much plot. There are plenty of reason to go back for more and the special features on the BluRay just add on top of that.
0061353248|5.0|Finally a book that has captured some theories I've had for years! Simply put, there are patterns even in the supposedly random.  An excellent read for anyone but especially business entrepreneurs. After you read this book, you will not only learn more about others, but most importantly, yourself.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|I got this as a gift with my Kindle Fire and I am thankful that my husband had the foresight to bought a cover/case for it. I have had it for a few months now and it has protected my Kindle on many occasions of clumsiness. It also does very well as a stand for the Kindle. I think that is is worth the money for this case cover because it not only protects the back but it also covers the front when I put it in my bag.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|I was really pleased to have the chance to read more after I tore through 'The Forever Girl'! I didn't know what to expect, but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! I could not believe what poor Ophelia was being asked to give up, and my heart broke right along side hers every minute! Rebecca did some QUALITY WORK in this novella and I cannot wait until I can sink my teeth into the next full length installment! You need not have read 'The Forever Girl' to enjoy or understand this piece, but you will surely want to read it after!!!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|love it this is a great game can be time consuming  try it you'll like it as well. tricky at times but lots of fun
B004GJYROG|5.0|This movie is a classic. My grandchildren had never heard of it, so I had to buy it. They laughed till they had tummy aches. They keep watching it over and over.
B006M4F67A|5.0|One of the best I've played because they let you make your own moves. I love the pattern and you don't have to pick one. Grand game!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I saw yes do the first five songs of this cd in concert last night in denver. (procal harum was the opener!)  And the audience was impressed with this suite. The cd is yes doing prog rock in all it's glory. The songs here could fit into any classic yes recordings of the past. Well done , yes.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My kids and I love watching Perry and seeing what sort of missions he goes on &amp; we love Where's My Water, so this is a GREAT combination of them both!! Can't wait to see the new levels.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I think of this set as a visual encyclopedia of life on earth;  if you have not seen this you cannot begin to imagine the absolutely unreal and amazing things they captured on film for us.  I dont want to go into detail so you wont miss out on the 'wow' factor when it comes as a complete surprise; and it will.<br /><br />A huge hats off to the cameramen who managed to capture shots that almost seem impossible and to the BBC for having the vision to budget so much money to do this right.<br /><br />My preferred version is the one narrated by David Attenborough, his voice is almost hypnotic.  I have to give credit to Sigourney Weaver for the version she narrated as well, though I very much prefer Attenboroughs' version I think she did a pretty exceptional job herself.  So whichever one you get for narration you are in for a real treat.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0345803485|1.0|What I Learned From This Trilogy:<br /><br />Being stalked is okay as long as your stalker is hot and rich and distracts you from his creepiness with expensive gifts.<br /><br />If you let a man beat the hell out of you and humiliate you sexually, he will immediately  want to get married and have kids with you.<br /><br />EL James must be a genius because she's raking in millions with this CRAP
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Pure degradation of women! I would never recommend...it's so evil I've deleted it from my Kindle. Where do the authors do their research? Filth!
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Update erases all progress and gives a new planet you have to pay an extra dollar for.  Get the free version instead.
0345803485|4.0|I'm not much of a reader, but I have to say all the hype about Fifty Shades was enough to make me check it out.  As soon as Christian was introduced in the book, I was hooked.  The complexity of his character had me mezmarized and wanting to know what made him be the way he is today.  I am already half way through Fifty Shades Darker and the slow reveal of Christian's past is intoxicating.  I will absolutely be reading Fifty Shades Freed as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wasnt planning to read this book but once I started, couldn't put it down.  Went right into the rest of the series and loved them all.  I also recommend the Author's other series Gregor, the Overlander.  Collins has a knack for writing a great story without resorting to titillation or mindless filler.  I am a voracious reader, a.ways looking for something new to keep my attention, and these books really met my requirements!

B0072NWJRK|5.0|If you are in any way interested in the history of Beijing China in 1935 to the time Mao invaded northern China in 1948 this is the story for you. The author is so well versed in the British mainly and other  \\" white people\\" living in the Orient that time, That I was hooked from the minute I started reading it. The main story line is about the murder of a beautiful English girl and the mysterious happenings during the time of the search for the killer.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|I have followed P.D.James and her wonderful, mysterious, and spelling binding stories for many years.  I am fond of the old English settings and characters.  I'm so glad that Amazon carries books of this type and especially happy to have the books for my Kindle.
B004H0M8EA|5.0|changed my value system for the better. instead of demonizing past peoples and societies who collapsed creates a blue print for how we might succeed in the future.
B000EQ5SRK|3.0|Well, when you put Sharon Stone in a sexy movie production, like this one, you can only expect sexy scenes, of course having Baldwin as the male star doesn't hurt either.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Hello,<br />This little flash for its size is remarkably strong. The refresh time is fast. I originally was looking at buying one of the no-name chinese knock off's for half the price but ended with getting a nikon flash for a nikon camera.<br /><br />The reason why I mention this is that having a nikon flash on a nikon camera they \\"talk\\" to each other so I don't have concern myself with settings . Just focusing on my shoot.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this flash.<br /><br />Rick
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have this game on my ipod and I had been waiting for it to come out for my fire. thanks team lava
B005LAIGSC|3.0|Fairly typical Hollywood formula script, but the acting of \\"D\\" Dub and the breakout performance by Ryan Reynolds make this a worthy movie to watch.  RR expanded his talents with a decent performance in \\"Buried\\" but in \\"Safe House\\" he took it to a new level and has finally arrived as a \\"5 tool\\" multi-talented star.  This performance combined with his RomCom and Drama skills should put RR on track to become the next Brad Pitt or Denzel.  Looking forward to seeing him in other good roles that display his new found acting depth. The movie story was \\"meh\\", but the pace of the action sequences was strong and the gritty acting by the entire cast was \\"super\\".  Overall, not bad thanks to the performances from \\"D\\" Dub and Ryan Reynolds.
0307956350|5.0|The book was set in Luxembourg where we have visited.  It was a good read.  The book arrived on time and in good condition.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is one of those games that make you think and keep digging for the next move. It gets to you at times and it gives you a smile when you meet the challenge.
B005MMY5RK|4.0|Probably the greatest movie ever made. Watch movies on Amazon Prime and love it. But with this movie (and others) the disappointment comes when you realize you can not see any of the features without actually buying the movie. Not just buying the download.... You have to buy the actual disc to see the special features. Netflix, VUDU,Direct TV Cinema, they are all like that. Wish it didn't have to be that way. I think Amazon will quickly become the leader in this fairly new venue.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These headphones serve its purpose for general listening! Not meant to produce BOSE quality sound.<br />For my general radio use they do fine for the price. Would recommend for non-stereo listening.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have been using Spashtop for quite awhile now to access my computer in my computer room from the Living room. I have limited mobility and this woks great if I need to to access something on the computer. It sometimes makes my wife mad if she is on the computer when I take it over!

B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very addicting as others have stated. I have it on my Android phone, but I really like playing it on my Kindle Fire. The graphics are great, there aren't crazy permissions and I like the fact that it's a game that you can actually play with the original download instead of spending money just to advance. You can spend money, but it's totally optional. Fabulous game.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|John Carter was a terrible and boring movie. My kids and I both thought that the actors were terrible and overly dramatic. I would have given it no stars if that were an option. You are being ripped off for the price. Terrible.

006197806X|4.0|Pandemonium is the second in a trilogy planned by Lauren Oliver, who writes so well that one keeps reading just to see what happens next.  However, this novel has a different mood from the first.  Delirium was fast paced and a \\"couldn't put it downer\\" while Pandemonium is a more reflective approach.<br /><br />The novel picks up where the first ended when Lena wakes up in the Wilds after leaving Alex behind to be captured and probably killed.  The author explores Lena's feelings about him in depth as well as her regret in leaving the \\"safe\\" life she once endured.  As Lena learns to live in the Wilds and bonds with the rebels who rescue her she matures as well.  In the first novel she was more needy and dependent while in this one she gradually becomes aggressive at times as well as an independent thinker willing to sacrifice for her own beliefs.<br /><br />I liked Raven, leader of the rebel group that rescued the wounded Lena.  She is tough and pragmatic yet shows a softer side when she thinks no one can see it.  What I didn't like was how the group \\"used\\" Lena to rescue Julian but I understand that it was necessary to the character the author developed.  The interactions between Lena and Julian were sensitive but I felt that Lena's feelings for Julian developed far too quickly for one who seemed so much in love with another.<br /><br />Yes, parts of this novel are predictable but exciting nevertheless.  While I suspected the ending, it nevertheless prompted me to put the novel among my future reads.  I just can't wait to see what happens to these interesting characters.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|This is a very cute and simple game that really makes you think of strategies to play it. For all of the puzzle mavens out there, this game is for you. It's a simple concept of utilizing triangles to get a moving ball in holes. Sounds easy right?  Well the level of difficulty increases each level, and each level you progress unlocks another one. You have to make sure that the ball goes through all the holes before it exits the box, or else you have to start over. Once you've finished, you get a grade on how well you cleared the level, from A to F. You can also replay levels, or choose the level you desire to play as long as it is one you've unlocked.<br /><br />Another cool thing about this game is that you have the ability to create puzzles for you to solve, or play puzzles that others have created. That really gives you the opportunity to challenge yourself and to see the creativity that others have, so you can compile ideas for your own puzzles. You can also allow others to play the puzzles you've created.<br /><br />Really easy game to pass the time with.
0525952616|5.0|I started recommending Kill Decision to my friends before I was halfway through it. Now that I've finished it, I have a longer list of people to recommend it to. Suarez writes a knockout thriller, and yes, it really should be opening in theaters everywhere before long. It's more military, and less cyberpunk, than his previous books, so it's going to appeal to a somewhat different set of folks as a novel. However.<br /><br />I'm recommending Kill Decision to people because it raises serious issues that deserve careful consideration. The black-hat PR folks astroturfing social media. The use, abuse, and proliferation of armed UAVs, persistent surveillance, and open-source intelligence. The attribution challenge of cyber warfare. By pushing these themes (and others--trying to avoid spoilers) to an extreme, Suarez creates an opening to think about where the limits are, and where they should be.<br /><br />Kill Decision is a thrill ride of an adventure novel, the kind that keeps you up at night to finish reading it, before it keeps you up at night thinking about whether it could happen. For those who work anywhere near any of these topics, it's also a great jumping off point for getting into serious issues. Read it now, so you'll know what you're talking about when it comes up in conversation.
B007PKOKTK|1.0|this was a $3.99 rental purchase that did not download and after many attempts I gave up.  did not get to see the movie.

B000RGSO82|5.0|So im not here to review the actual music on this collection but the vinyl edition! first off i had a hard time findin this set for a good price and finally got it from newbury comics for a little over 20 bucks. the package holds 2 180 gram beautiful records , gatefold w an extra big pic of stevie that is not in the cd edition booklet. it is also very strong carddboard housing everything probaly one of the best vinyl productions ive seen recently, unfortunately they didnt make many of these so youll have to pay upwards of 25 dollars on ebay but imop id pay full price without any hesitation w the quality materials used to make this perfect collection! overall any vinyl/nicks fan shouldnt hesitate and go find a copy its truely wonderful love u ms nicks
B0086700CM|4.0|Im not a huge gamer, but I found this to be a little fun. I didn't find it as fun as most others, but I would say it's worth a look to those interested.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 on Verizon. The app can ONLY download to the phone's memory (same with my Motorola Droid X), and NOT my external micro SDHC card (where I, like many, store MUSIC/pictures/videos). The music tracks are like 7MB each. And don't blab to me about the Cloud Drive. While that sounds great in theory, with only Sprint keeping unlimited data plans available (I just lost mine in this last phone upgrade), streaming music all the time is not gonna cut it. I end up having to download the songs onto my PC, then syncing it to my phone's SD card (using Samsung Kies... argh.... slow... but blame that on Android losing UMS and going MTP). Ugghhhh...... Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Just as good as you hope it is.  A great mix....and tons of songs. All the hard rocking you expect with a few surprises. Enjoy!
B0034DGPEU|1.0|This is not a good book. It is a bodice ripper masquerading as historical fiction.  It is not well written or literary at all. The characters are one dimensional, the plot unbelievable, and it is not historically accurate. It wasn't even good enough to be a quick, non-thinking read--it was just bad. I couldnt finish it. Don't waste your money.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I find the app very helpful and easy to use.  The picture themes are unique and assist you with putting emphasis on the pictures you want to add contrast to. I apply it to all of my photos and I refer this app to many of my colleagues! (:
B008J05EL8|1.0|totally insane price. going to click do not mention again for this ludicrous offer. it should have come with the original app. shows that the developers lack common sense. I will not buy another one of their products seeing the updates are so expensive.

B0068FYZ9S|5.0|Movie - 4.0<br /><br />When this movie initially came out, I was very reluctant to see it. I had this weird and stupid bias against Matt Damon for whatever reason I can't even remember now, but that's in the past. Once I got wise, though, my very first viewing of this film (as well as the rest of the trilogy) came in the form of their BD releases. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised, especially for this being the first of three parts in an overall story. The film begins with the discovery of a man in the ocean by a group of fishermen; a man with two bullet holes in his back, a Swiss bank account number in his hip, and no memory of who he is. He can fluently speak foreign languages and is apparently a master in firearms and fisticuffs, but still can't remember his name or how he ended up where he did. In reaching the Swiss bank, he finds a deposit box with a passport. The name inside: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Also in the box are multiple other passports, all with the same picture, but different names. And so, Bourne embarks on a journey to find out who he really is, meeting a gypsy woman named Marie (Franka Potente), in which they face assassins and conspiracy coverups with only each other to depend on.<br /><br />For me, this movie not only re-defined the spy-thriller genre (James Bond should thank this franchise because I think his recent incarnation was really influenced by it), but it made me a huge fan of Matt Damon. It's a gritty, more realistic, and down-to-earth depiction that relies less on flash and pizazz and tells a very humanistic story. If I were to break it down, I would say the appeal comes from about a third in the writing, a third in the acting, and a third in the score. The writing succeeds a lot in terms of subtlety; it doesn't explain a whole lot, but leaves enough for the audience to understand and empathize Bourne without ever getting ahead of him. This, in turn, is brilliantly performed by Damon who's portrayal is just as subtle as the writing; he's cool, calm, and collected, yet carries a certain degree of violence and ferocity when his training kicks in. And then there's the music; John Powell creates a very engaging score with three particularly crucial elements that, in my opinion, really drive the film: Bourne's main theme (which adds a sense of mystery and intrigue), a lot of percussion pieces (which sound great for action sequences), and the trademark whirring effect (that foreshadows Bourne's time to kick ass). The Bourne Identity is a very well-made spy-thriller that, as director Doug Liman puts it, \\"is made with a lot of European sensibilities,\\" making this a very refreshing take for the time it was made. Not only does it provide the mystery and action of a spy movie, but the additional cerebral aspect makes it that much more enjoyable. And it only gets better in the sequels.<br /><br />Video - 4.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />The Bourne franchise makes its first entry onto high definition with a pretty good transfer. I say \\"pretty good,\\" which may seem a bit generous considering a couple of gripes I have with it, but all in all, I'd say the pros outweigh the cons. Let's start with the good. General detail and sharpness look great, capturing some excellent scenic shots, revealing a decent amount of line delineation between clothes and objects, and showing some of the finer features on peoples' faces and hair during closeup shots. Colors are vivid, albeit slightly de-saturated, with lots of reds and orange being at the forefront of the spectrum. The red bank bag that Bourne wears around the beginning of the film tends to especially stand out, along with the occasional random red object in the background. The jacket he also wears in the beginning and the one big explosion that the movie has literally explodes orange when it does happen. Skin tones are very lifelike with great variation from person to person and reflect accordingly depending on the lighting of the scene. Black levels aren't super-deep, but do enough to help accentuate the intrigue during darker scenes or nighttime shots. The film also supports a nice, light layer of grain and never gets in the way.<br /><br />The two bad things? Contrast and damage. Contrast is generally a tad on the low side giving the movie a kind of murky look with even daytime shots looking a little on the dim side. The detail is still good enough, but compared to other movies I've seen with low contrast that still manage to have a pristine picture, this one doesn't really hold up. Throughout the course of the movie, there are also various instances of dirt and even one or two moments where scratches from print damage popped up for a split second. They're not terribly obvious, but they are noticeable. In the end, though, Oliver Wood's photography looks great and really helps to maintain a very earthy, yet exotic look to the cityscapes, indoor sets, and wider-viewed shots. My favorite parts to look at are the snowy streets of Zurich for it's variation in color around the city, the shootout at the farmhouse for its detail, and the nighttime shots around the end of the movie for the blacks.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />While the video portion of this disc isn't quite perfect, the audio comes much closer. As I mentioned about the music being an integral part of the film, interestingly enough, the movie opens with the Universal credits, but doesn't play the Universal theme. Instead, it's starts out silent and fades into the sound effects, then into the main title theme of Bourne. General immersion is excellent with the score having a pulse of its own through a lot of the drumming beats and tense string pieces. And then, of course, there's that trademark whirring effect, which when played, really enhances the mood of whatever is acting out on screen. Directionality and separation dominate the sound field when action sequences take precedent, though dialogue thankfully remains clear regardless of how loud a crash, gunshot, or broken window gets.<br /><br />In particular, I was very pleased with how well-isolated the effects were in the scene where Bourne is fending off the first Treadstone assassin. When the guy breaks in, it was completely quiet beforehand, and then all hell broke loose. But even then, when Bourne and Marie are being pursued by the French police, the car chase sequence does a bit of the opposite by having a very lively mix of automotive chaos and snazzy Euro-techno that almost felt like a scene out of The Transporter. I would say this scene utilizes the rear speakers best with some very aggressive effects as some of the cars come buzzing around tight corners and others start crashing into one another. And then towards the end of the film when Bourne is fighting Clive Owen's character, we get a great example of the middle road. It's isolated enough like the first assassination attempt when Bourne blows up a tanker providing some real pounding LFEs, but then it also feels very immersive when he fires another shot and the birds in the field start flying around. To sum it up, The Bourne Identity has a great sound design and mix. The actual sound quality has a lot of depth to it, with both the high and low ends displaying great dynamic range. As a whole, it's not quite reference material, but I would liken that more to the nature of the film itself having a lot of quieter moments. But rest assured, though, that the sequels will definitely fix that right up.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Doug Liman)<br />This is a very informative track with a wealth of information that covers a wide variety of aspects from the writing, casting, filming, set designs, editing,scoring; you name it. Essentially, what I found most interesting were the comments Liman had about the heart of the story and its presentation; namely, how he wanted to bring a sense of grit and realism to the spy-thriller genre, making it a drama, first, and an action film, second. He goes into great detail about the depiction of Bourne and how he and Damon collaborated to make the character feel subtle and empathetic, yet strong and determined throughout the circumstances of the story. In fact, Liman really stressed the parallels between the Kali fighting style that Bourne uses and how its core philosophy of energy conservation and quick, brutal efficiency ties into Bourne's overall demeanor. He later goes on to talk about character motivations and how Damon and Potente did particularly good jobs at humanizing the character of Bourne in such a way that, I feel, had a gradual impact on the look and feel of other modern spy-thrillers succeeding this one (here's looking at you, Bond). Oddly enough, there were a few very large dead spots, but for the most part, when Liman talks, he really lets loose.<br /><br />- The Ludlum Identity (SD; 12:49)<br />Tells us a little bit about the famed author of the series, Robert Ludlum, namely, things like: how he made the transition from theater actor to novelist, how he tied those theater experiences into his writing, how a lot of the locales he came up with were inspired by post WWII-Europe, how he saw conspiracy in authority, and finally how he came to adopt the trend of 3-word titles for all of his works (\\"The [whatever] [whatever]\\").<br /><br />- The Ludlum Supremacy (SD; 12:41)<br />Talks about the origin of Bourne's name, Ludlum's personality in general and how it was reflected through the character of Bourne, some of the differences between the movie and novel (such as the omission of Carlos the Jackal), how The Bourne Identity boosted his status as an author, and then the eventual progression that was a result from Identity's success.<br /><br />- The Ludlum Ultimatum (SD; 23:57)<br />This piece covers a pretty huge chunk of Jason Bourne's story arc between the first and second movie. If you've seen all the films by this point, then it's an excellent breakdown of the character, his motivations, and the themes they wrote into the plot. If by some chance this is your first time seeing Identity, do no watch this feature, as it will contain some major spoilers for Supremacy.<br /><br />- Alternate Opening and Ending (SD; 10:46 altogether)<br />Starts with a brief introduction by the 3 guys listed below and mentions how the movie had to be adjusted after the events of 9/11 for the sake of changed sensibilites. They were concerned about the \\"datedness\\" of the subject material and how it would make audiences react. The alternate opening basically would have turned the whole movie into a flashback and tying up in present day at the end. They say they were pretty happy with the ending you see in the final cut (and so am I).<br /><br />- Introduction with Producer Frank Marshall, Co-Writer Tony Gilroy, and Actor Brian Cox (3:33)<br />- Alternate Opening (2:16)<br />- Alternate Ending (4:56)<br /><br />-Deleted Scenes (SD; 6:58)<br />Listed below are the individual scenes:<br /><br />- Wombosi on the Private Jet (0:59)<br />- Bourne and Marie by the Side of the Road (2:29)<br />- Psychologist Discusses Bourne (1:46)<br />- Bourne and Marie Practice on Subway (1:42)<br /><br />- Extended Farmhouse Scene (0:58)<br />Liman actually makes a quick reference to this in the commentary. He said this scene was left in the European version of the film, but then went on to say it was cut from the American version for \\"timing reasons.\\" As if 58 seconds really makes that big of a difference in theater showings per day...<br /><br />- The Birth of the Bourne Identity (SD; 14:31)<br />A pretty generic EPK-style feature that tells you how Bourne is different from your average spy-thrill title. It has very badly-edited interviews that are short and whose sporadic nature doesn't really tell you much at all. I recommend you avoid this if you're looking for actual depth and quality.<br /><br />- The Bourne Mastermind: Robert Ludlum (SD; 5:44)<br />Mostly recycled information talking about Ludlum's transition from theater to writing. It offers a little more retrospect after the fact, but it's too short and not much more than you can hear about in the other features above.<br /><br />- Access Granted: An Interview with Co-Writer Tony Gilroy (SD; 4:03)<br />Talks about the essence of Bourne and how the movies had to be adapted for modern times, as opposed to the Cold War mentality they originally had when it started in the '80s.<br /><br />- From Identity to Supremacy: Jason & Marie (SD; 3:37)<br />Some interviews with Damon and Potente about the characters they play, how they interpreted their motivations, and the transition they had to make when filming Supremacy. Damon said that Bourne's actions are what he feels develops the character, while Potente praises how non-cliché her character was and how the chemistry between Bourne and Marie is sporadic throughout the relationship.<br /><br />- The Bourne Diagnosis (SD; 3:25)<br />Talks about the actual medical condition of the amnesia Bourne suffers in the plot. The psychologist basically says that Bourne suffers from Selective Dissociative Amnesia, but retains a Kinesthetic Memory of how to perform all of his trained skills. He also goes on to point out that the presence of Marie's character was a big help in portraying memory recovery.<br /><br />- Cloak and Dagger: Covert Ops (SD; 5:31)<br />An interview with an officer of the CIA who talks about the overt and covert operations they actually do perform and how accurate the depiction of Bourne and all the training technicalities were.<br /><br />- Inside a Fight Sequence (SD; 4:42)<br />Shows how the choreography was staged with stunt coordinator Nick Powell.<br /><br />- Moby \\"Extreme Ways\\" Music Video (SD; 3:38)<br />A music video to the ending credits song.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />There are 3 different interactive applications you can play along with the film:<br /><br />- Treadstone Files<br />A kind of gimmicky computerization that simulates certain parts of the movie to feel like you're looking through a high-tech dossier. It shows a bunch of trivial factoids and statistics about the characters, the locations, Treadstone, and all kinds of other information.<br /><br />- Bourne Orientation<br />PiP that plays like Warner Bros.' Maximum Movie Mode where the current scene and an older scene that may or may not contain interviews will split into 2 individual screens of their own and essentially rehash important plot points.<br /><br />- Picture in Picture<br />A true PiP application that opens up a little box in the corner of the screen with additional interviews not seen in the special features. Altogether, it equates to about 25 minutes and is divided into 8 chapters of the scene selection. Some of the material covered includes: the action and how Damon wanted to do his own stunts, filming in Paris, Liman casting Damon as Bourne and what it was like working with him, the relationship between Bourne and Marie, a more in-depth analysis of Marie's character, and a short look at the other Treadstone agents through an interview with Clive Owen. It's a little disappointing there aren't more interviews, but it's pretty well-worth the information.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />For the starter of the bunch, The Bourne Identity is a very entertaining refresher into, what was then, a faltering spy-thriller genre. This Blu-ray disc looks pretty good with only a couple of minor problems, the sound is fantastic considering there's more drama than action, and the special features are very informative. It's a shame Ludlum never got to see this, but the people that knew and vouched for him are pretty happy with the way it turned out. TheBourne franchise has certainly changed the genre (just look at how Daniel Craig's Bond movies have shaped up) and for the better. If you haven't seen this yet, definitely pick it up, then wait to be amazed by its sequels.
B005VT42BS|5.0|I was amazed at what this app can do. New to Gingerbread so this helped the learning curve be less steep.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have now read the entire series multiple times! It's a good, entertaining book that will keep you up until 2 or 3 in the morning. But so worth it! Not to mention how 'educational' and insightful the book can be for your intimate life!
B002M9WW30|5.0|I can't imagine anyone is looking to buy these movies that didn't see them years ago.  And, if you've seen them, you know that it would be impossible to review all five of them in one single review and do them justice.  And I'm going to assume that if you are looking to buy this set, you either love the movies, or they were part of your childhood memories and you don't need me to tell you about the movies themselves...  Instead, I'm just reviewing the quality of the transfers, the sound, and the extras, and I'm going to keep it short and sweet:<br /><br />The movies have never looked better.  I remember seeing them in the movie theater as a kid.  Grainy, dust and scratches on the film.  You know, the way movies were before the digital projectors we are all used to now.  No, these aren't as crisp and bright as movies today, but they preserve the graininess of the original film.<br /><br />The sound is great.<br /><br />The extras are interesting.<br /><br />Definitely worth the price to have the entire Rocky saga on your shelf in such pristine condition.
B0068FZ196|5.0|Movie - 5.0<br /><br />I have to say, when I originally blind-bought The Bourne Trilogy box set on BD, I had no idea what I was in for. I was thoroughly surprised by how well Identity turned out, as it was a very refreshing taste to its genre. It had a genuine sense of mystery and intrigue, and the European atmosphere only made it more exotic. Then, Paul Greengrass came along and took the franchise to new heights by developing a very emotional and symbolic story. But not only did he expand the humanity of Jason Bourne's character, he did so with a grittier, edgier kind of aesthetic. And in reaching the final act of the story, he surpasses even that with not only a more epic plot in the grand scheme of things, but with pure technical proficiency. The story actually backtracks to the end of Supremacy and picks up in Moscow where Bourne (Matt Damon) had just apologized to Irina Neski for killing her parents when he was first assigned as a Treadstone agent. Meanwhile, English journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) is receiving tips that the U.S. government has implemented a new Treadstone-upgrade division called Blackbriar, led by Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). In discovering Ross' interactions, Bourne proceeds to contact him and find his source to answer the last remaining questions of where he came from and who was responsible for these black ops programs to begin with. But upon Ross' assassination, Bourne must make the journey back home with the help of former handler Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and the benefit of the doubt from CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen).<br /><br />There are so many things that work in Ultimatum's favor to not only make it a masterful spy-thriller, but also a top-class action movie. Setup after setup is executed with pinpoint precision for every major sequence in terms of its brevity, cleverness, and importance to the plot. Not only is the entire film an exhilarating game of cat and mouse as the Blackbriar brass and Bourne match wits, but even the fight scenes and chases surpass everything from its predecessor (as Supremacy did to Identity). Most importantly, though, having cleared his guilty conscience and found atonement with his past, this film is especially adamant about now having Bourne find his roots as a killer, confronting his inner demons, having him accept what he is, and finally allowing him to move on. Damon performs this role flawlessly and shows a great amount of progression as the character of Jason Bourne that's very noticeable if you pay attention between each film. I think a big contribution to that is the way Paul Greengrass lets the actors play on their instincts. His method of film-making is fast-cut, kinetic, and visceral, and I feel it really helped make the Bourne series the franchise it is today. But again, I have to praise the action. Even as a \\"drama-first, action-second\\" kind of series, the level of excitement is so far up on the spectrum for each aspect, that I can't help but be amazed by everything these movies have managed to accomplish. They're smartly-written, wonderfully-produced, and have set the new standard for the genre.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />The photography itself is almost exactly the same as it was in Supremacy. Greengrass' visual style and Oliver Wood's lighting really make for a great picture. The differences this time around are: color saturation, which is a little more balanced and not as hot, and the grain is a little less heavy. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the overall tone of the movie isn't as dark as Supremacy and that most of the film is shot during daytime. And because of that, it allows for a lot more detail. Just look at the stunning clarity in overhead and closeup shots. The architecture of all the buildings and streets in London, Tangier, and New York, the pores onpeoples' faces or the fine texturing in their clothes; it's a very subtle difference in the adjustments made, but it's such a marked improvement over something that I already thought looked spectacular to begin with. Colors are still very vibrant, even with the slight drop in saturation. The blues and browns of London, the oranges and greys of Tangier, and the yellows and greens of New York all have a certain charm to the respective atmospheres they create.<br /><br />Blacks are still deep and inky with no signs of crush and show an excellent amount of delineation. My favorite aspect of the video, however, is the contrast. I think this is why the detail is so much more immaculate and makes for a more pleasing image. In fact, I'd say the brightness (and when I say \\"brightness,\\" it's actually not even that much) sets the movie up for a different tone altogether. Supremacy was darker because Bourne was discovering his dark, dirty secrets. But here in Ultimatum, he's essentially coming full circle, going towards the proverbial \\"light,\\" and trying to put an end to the cycle of violence that's followed him since his beginning days as a Treadstone agent. My scenes for reference are any of the overhead shots of the various cities (which has lots of great color), pretty much any closeup dialogue shot (for the subtle detail in the faces and hair), and any interior shot where there's very little light (for the blacks). Once again, the Bourne franchise is treated with a stellar video presentation.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum won 2 Oscars for sound. I'm a little baffled as to how it beat Transformers, though it's probably a political thing for the Academy not liking Michael Bay more than anything else, but that's okay. I'll take the Bourne series getting some kind of Academy recognition. Asif Supremacy didn't have enough of an aggressive sound mix, Ultimatum for all intents and purposes even managed to blow that one out of the water. The actual recording volume is a little bit higher, but the separation and directionality are mixed much more intricately. The scene at Waterloo Station is a prime example of how to really immerse an audience in the thick of all the action. You can hear people talking, their footsteps, the intercoms calling, the distant sounds of train signals, the trains themselves, the mechanical advertisements flipping sides at the top of the walls; every little detail is reference volume, abundant in number, and carefully placed in all the correct speakers when needed. Rear speaker activity, in particular, gets a great workout as there are a greater amount of scenes with crowds in the background.<br /><br />Much like Waterloo Station, the bustling crowd in Tangier and passers-by in New York really add a unique level of depth to a character that normally thrives on blending in and being clandestine. Blockbuster-type sound effects such as gunshots, car crashes, and other loud noises are phenomenal when they happen. The car chase towards the end is extremely chaotic and possesses a quality to it that's almost a bit jarring. LFEs are most prominent here when Bourne's car is driven right into the guard rail. And then there are my always-favorite isolation cues. I loved the scene in Supremacy when Bourne was fighting the last Treadstone agent because of its quiet and enclosed nature. The silence only amplified what was already a very intense action sequence, and I was especially happy they were able to make that effect even better when Bourne fights Desh. The sounds of glass crashing, props breaking, and the thumps and slaps of their hands and feet are amazing to listen to. Chalk up another perfect audio presentation.<br /><br />Extras - 3.5<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)<br />As he did with Supremacy, Greengrassoffers up another excellent and very informative commentary. First and foremost, he talks about Damon masterfully pulling off a a more tempered version of Jason Bourne and how the character has evolved since his appearance in the first film. Throughout, Greengrass also continues to break down crucial plot points giving great analysis, not just of Bourne, but of supporting characters, how they fit into the story, and the growing conspiracy within Blackbriar. Additionally, he also stresses the importance of setting the film's tempo very high right from the start. He compares it to \\"a really nice sports car that you have to keep steady, but must also know when to speed it up,\\" or something to that degree. And as much of a technical marvel as Ultimatum turned out to be, I wholeheartedly agree with his assessment. He talks about how in a thriller that the setup for any kind of sequence is the most important thing to execute, otherwise you lose the audience, and the twist is for nothing. He also talks about the logistics of shooting every now and then, but for the most part stays very focused talking about how he wanted to convey the tone of the movie through its action.<br /><br />- Deleted Scenes (SD; 12:22)<br />Again, not much to talk about.<br /><br />- Be Bourne Spy Training<br />Another kind of novelty application that shows you 5 movie clips and tests your ability for visual memorization, much like how Bourne was able to scan a room and tell you a bunch of stuff when he was in the diner in Identity.<br /><br />- Man on the Move: Jason Bourne (SD; 23:58 altogether)<br />Provides a break down of the different locations they shot at. Interestingly enough, the scenes in Moscow for this film were actually shot in east Berlin because it was January at the time of filming and everything in Moscow was too cold to shoot (and probably froze everything over). Meanwhile, London was one of the more difficult sets to shoot, as it was one of the more crowded sequences. It took 5months just to secure all the logistics, and even then a lot of the people you see in those shots weren't extras because they couldn't completely shut the station down (for obvious reasons). The same goes for Tangier. In fact, they were shooting during Ramadan, which forced a lot of the cast and crew to fast with everyone else. Below are the cities broken up individually:<br /><br />- Berlin (6:10)<br />- Paris (3:41)<br />- London (4:14)<br />- Madrid (4:06)<br />- Tangier (5:45)<br /><br />- Roof Pursuit (SD; 5:39)<br />Shows the work they had to do in constructing zip line camera rigs for the sequence, as well as how they managed to turn a stuntman into a JumpCam operator when Bourne is jumping off a building and through a window.<br /><br />- Planning the Punches (SD; 4:59)<br />Starts off with Joey Ansah (who played Desh) talking about how he's skilled in Capoeira and that the studio was going to teach him something else. The feature then shows coordinator Jeff Imada talking about Filipino Kali (once again), and then they show the setup of Damon and Ansah's scene with the rubber props they put around for safety.<br /><br />- Driving School (SD; 3:23)<br />Pretty self-explanatory. Just shows us how Damon prepped for some of the stunt driving. He's actually pretty good at it.<br /><br />- New York Chase (SD; 10:46)<br />Mainly talks about how staging a giant car chase sequence in New York City was a logistics nightmare and that it required a lot of planning to get things situated. There's not a whole lot of actual interviewing, just mostly footage of them setting stuff up and shooting the scene.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />4 different interactive applications to play along with the movie:<br /><br />- Volkswagon: Get More Info<br />Specs and information on the VW Toureg V10 TDI. This would've been great if I were playing Gran Turismo.<br /><br />- Blackbriar Files<br />Like Treadstone Files in the first movie and The Bourne Dossier in the second, it's a high-tech simulator that displays a bunch of statistics and information on people, places, and other things. It's cool to look at, but again, it's just a novelty.<br /><br />- Bourne Orientation<br />Also like the first two films, this repeats important plot information to the point of redundancy. Skip it.<br /><br />- Picture in Picture<br />Much less effort was put into this feature as compared to Supremacy. The PiP commentaries only total a little over 35 minutes and are spread out over 12 of the 20 chapters. They're fairly informative, but the lower quantity is a bit disappointing. Some of the topics covered are: character analyses/interpretations, shooting logistics, general opinions about the franchise and its success, and a few anecdotes and stories about working with one another. Might be worth a watch at some point, but it's not nearly as engaging as it could've been.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />So the story of Jason Bourne has reached its conclusion, and in grand, epic fashion. Throughout the journey we watched as he re-discovered himself and took down a deeply corrupted system. It's bittersweet in a way, but it was enjoyable, nonetheless. The BD presents The Bourne Ultimatum with absolutely pristine picture and sound. And while the extra features are a lot lighter than the previous two films, it at least provides an excellent commentary that should satisfy the die-hard Bourne fan. If you haven't seen any of these films yet and are in the mood for an awesome spy-thriller, definitely give this franchise a shot.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Fun, but...annoying ad starts each new game. Can't complain too much; it's free. I would pay $0.99 for an adless game.
0545302862|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. I needed a break from Vampire books for a while and this fit the bill! One of my friends recommended it- he's a little over 50 and I am 37, and I'm glad I took his recommendation. Good jaunt through Greek mythology as well!
1594484805|4.0|This was a fairly quick read.  And I found it quite interesting.  Not only interesting but insightful.  I can definitely look around the areas of my life, work, organizations I belong to, what I hear from friends about their places of work, and I can see the points in this book validated.  And it did give some seeds to try and work with.  But, it seems like there could have been so much more offered.  Seeing that the Appendices were such a substantial part of the book, I thought they would offer a lot of practical ideas on how to find and identify Type I people, how to build a Type I environment, etc... you, know as an employer, what are some ways I can really identify if the employees I have are Type I fitting into a Type X or truly Type X?  Any ways in an interview to help identify Type I vs. Type X.  Good approaches for helping people transition to a Type I mentality or Type I workplace, etc...  Real practical tools...  There were a few, but not nearly as much useful material as you would expect to find when so much of the book was \\"Toolkit\\" material...<br /><br />But definitely worth reading.
B0068FZ18C|5.0|Movie - 5.0<br /><br />As I said in my review of the first film, I stand by the belief that the Bourne franchise has ultimately changed the face of spy-thriller movies forever. Sure, the occasional flashy James Bond flick was fun to watch, but there's only so much style you can take after a while till it becomes a bit redundant. Thankfully, these Bourne films were so successful that they were able to re-imagine Agent 007 in a different light, a dark, grittier one that you can clearly see in their current films since Daniel Craig took over the title. But that's beside the point. The point is that I'm really, really thankful because if Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass never directed these, who knows what kind of mediocrity we'd be having to put up with instead. The Bourne Supremacy opens up 2 years after the end of Identity. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franka Potente) are living in Goa supposedly out of the grasp of anyone looking to find them. Bourne has recently begun having nightmares about a man and woman he once assassinated, but still can't manage to piece together anything else relevant between that and his past days in Treadstone. Meanwhile, an operation in Berlin to uncover a mole amongst the top CIA brass, led by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), goes south when a Russian federal agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the deal and takes out the informant while leaving a fingerprint of Bourne to cover his tracks. Then in an attempt to put Bourne out of the picture, Marie is killed in his stead. Grieved and angered by the loss, Bourne sets out to find those responsible. However, in his pursuit of vengeance, he would discover things about his past that would change him for the better.<br /><br />The Bourne Identity was a refreshing breath of fresh air showing us a man who, at one point, was a cold-blooded killer doing his duty, but upon certain events had a change of heart. A major reason for that was because of a woman he met, a woman that stayed with him and showed him the side of life he had been missing out on. Upon losing her, this man would once again fall into the web of coverups, deception, and lies in search of truth, retribution, and eventual redemption. As if Identity didn't establish the humanity within Bourne enough, Supremacy takes that aspect even further by provoking an act of pure, motivated revenge, that otherwise evolves into a search for inner peace and a realization of humility. With this being the first of director Paul Greengrass' installments, the pacing of both the plot and action are doubly intensified. In addition, the cinematography, fight and stunt choreography, music, and production easily surpass its predecessor. The camera cuts are as quick and vicious as Bourne's ability to take people out, the fights more brutal, the chases more adrenaline-pumping, the music more pulsating, and best of all, the story more symbolic. This definitely takes care of the emotional side of the story arc, and even then, the final part of trilogy will manage to surpass that. Keep going, you're almost done.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Same director of photography, different director for the movie. The result: an amazing and visceral image compared to the first one! Paul Greengrass did a superb job not only propelling the franchise to new heights with the story, but also with the aesthetic presentation. Black levels are very deep (maybe a little too deep for some) making that sense of mystery and intrigue established in Identity that much more mysterious and intriguing. Even as hot and bright as the colors are in the Goa scenes, the blacks and more balanced contrast give the overall image so much more definition. The colors, by the way, are quite bold this time around. Goa alone has an exuberant amount of reds, oranges, and browns that make you feel like you're in theheat with Bourne and Marie. And even with a very fine layer of grain, detail and sharpness remain intact. Just look a the sweat running down the characters' faces, the texturing in the trees, ground objects, and street markets. And only a fraction of the movie even takes place here.<br /><br />The journey to Berlin is considerably darker, with a lot of the backdrops having more opaque set pieces, more interior shots (with small rooms and such), and a few more scenes shot at nighttime. The black levels are amazing here, but there's surprisingly a sparse amount of noise and grain to get in the way. And finally, the last part of the film in Moscow has a lot of color differentiation. The car chase sequence displays excellent detail in terms of line delineation and object clarity, especially when things start crashing and parts, glass, and other debris go flying around the street. My favorite shots for reference are the scene in Goa when Kirill is standing on the beach looking for Bourne (lots of color), the scene in Munich when Bourne pays a visit to the sole remaining Treadstone agent (lots of grain, but also lots of detail considering how close up the shots are), and finally the car chase in the Moscow tunnel (a little dim, but not super-dark, and again, lots of grain and detail). Some people may think the grain is a bit excessive, but I love the filmic texture it adds. And because of that I can't find any fault in the video.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />In conjunction with the newer cinematography, the sound is also vastly improved. While the quality in Identity was pretty top-notch itself, there weren't enough moments for it to truly shine. The design and mixing in Supremacy, however, is quite aggressive. The biggest upgrade I noticed immediately is the general immersion. Scenes like the bustling streets of Goa or the protest rally at Alexanderplatz offer all kinds of separation and directionality. You can hear individual vehicles making noise, people talking, the change in volume when objects are in the way, the transference of sounds when the camera pans or cuts to a different angle, and these aren't even the real action sequences. Stuff like the foot chase in Berlin and the car chase in Moscow offer even more sonic perfection in terms of subtlety, dynamic range, and overall buoyancy. My favorite aspects of the audio, though, are its isolation, and the way the music is used. Particularly, I really love the scene where Bourne fights the last Treadstone agent. There's absolutely no music here, and the fight itself is contained in this small little area where you can hear every punch, shuffle, footstep, knife swipe, and paper slap without a single exterior source to disturb it. I personally think this is the most intense scene of the entire film, and a lot of it has to do with the sound, or lack thereof. And then there's the music.<br /><br />The more I keep listening to the score and sampling all the various parts of the movie for reference, the more I'm starting to like John Powell. As a composer, he really lets loose here with the strings and drums. The level at which the music is played is as subtle as the movie's sound effects, and when the pieces actually are played, it really puts you in the scene. LFEs are especially pounding, as the score pulsates and propels the action. Meanwhile, the car chase is probably the other big sequence to pay attention to. The cars running into each other and crashing offer up some pretty good rumbles that, if you have a decent sound system, should provide plenty of room-shaking bass. And yes, like the story itself, the sound gets even better in Ultimatum.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)<br />This is a much different commentary than what Doug Liman gave for Identity. While Liman talked a lot about the technical aspects of the filming, Greengrass goes very in-depth about the writing and how he wanted to present certain themes/ideas through the action, especially in the way it was shot. A lot of people complain about the shaky camerawork and quick editing, but Greengrass repeatedly emphasizes how he wanted to keep it \\"real\\" (which is also presented as a short featurette on its own in the special features). In allowing the cameras to be handheld and literally follow Bourne's character in everything he does, its intent is to put the audience with him, as well as give the film a more gritty feel. He constantly breaks down key moments of the film as they unfold and goes on to talk about the actors, namely, why he cast them, what he liked about them, and how their personalities reflected well in their characters. There were a few more dead spots in this commentary than there were with Liman's, but it's just as informative and worth a listen.<br /><br />- Explosive Deleted Scenes (SD; 10:46)<br />Not much to say about them.<br /><br />- Matching Identities: Casting (SD; 5:23)<br />Talks about the casting. Greengrass starts off by giving Damon high praise for his ability to play both sides of Bourne so well (the tortured soul, and the ruthless killer). He also says he liked the choice of Allen to play Landy, as he thinks she's quite classy, much like Chris Cooper was for his role in Identity. He then goes on to talk about the film not having one bad guy, but that they were all part of a bad system (which will become very important for the third film).<br /><br />- Keeping it Real (SD; 4:58)<br />Talks about the process of selecting Greengrass to become the new director of the franchise. He says he wanted to portray a truthfulness and realism, which shows through the shaky-camera cinematography. He also makes the point of not wanting the actors to think too much so that their movements are more instinctual and intense.<br /><br />- Blowing ThingsUp (SD; 4:00)<br />Shows how they blew up the house in Munich and how they didn't us any CG because they wanted more realism to it. Interestingly enough, they got the whole shot in just one take.<br /><br />- On the Move with Jason Bourne (SD; 4:45)<br />Takes a look at the scouting and talks about how they wanted to film the real places in Europe for the film. Berlin was chosen for its historical relevance and as an homage to old spy stories. Moscow was chosen because the city itself has never really been used for movies and because Greengrass felt it gave off a vibe of truthfulness. And then Goa was chosen because it reflected the exuberance and restlessness represented in Bourne's character at that moment in the film.<br /><br />- Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training (SD; 4:21)<br />Shows us the staging for the fight between Bourne and the last remaining Treadstone agent. Fight coordinator Jeff Imada goes over the basic concept of the Kali style used, Greengrass points out how he wanted to really use Venetian blinds for the aesthetic of the scene and that he wanted the fight too look sloppy and raw, yet structured at the same time.<br /><br />- Crash Cam: Racing Through the Streets of Moscow (SD; 5:58)<br />Shows us how the riveting car chase sequence was filmed. They wanted this to be better than the one in Identity by putting a sense of desperation in Bourne to get to his destination, and they did so by making all the cameras either loose or handheld and putting them either in the car or very close to the windows.<br /><br />- The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action (SD; 6:49)<br />Talks about the Go-Mobile, a camera rig that essentially attaches itself to the front end of a vehicle to put an actor right in the action of a car-driving sequence. They say it's built to be safe (with a very low center of gravity so it never tips over) and that it allows for a lot of different camera angles you wouldn't normally be able to get.<br /><br />- Anatomy of a Scene: The ExplosiveBridge Chase Scene (SD; 4:40)<br />A look at how the foot chase in Berlin was filmed. Damon says shooting it was safe and fun.<br /><br />- Scoring with John Powell (SD; 4:46)<br />I love when we can actually take a look at the scoring of a film, especially here because I feel the music in the Bourne series is such an important driving force. Powell says he doesn't conduct, but likes to offer a lot of input during the process. He also says the score itself re-uses a lot of the themes from the first film, but that the new one created for Goa is meant to represent Marie and that it follows Bourne around till the end of the movie. Specifically, it's a theme that plays during her funeral scene, then comes full circle to symbolize his eventual atonement.<br /><br />- The Bourne Mastermind (Part 2) (SD; 4:42)<br />More rehashed interviews with Ludlum that you might have already seen if you watched the ones on Identity. There's a little more additional retrospect here, but not much else.<br /><br />- The Bourne Diagnosis (Part 2) (SD; 5:39)<br />Gives us a little more psychological analysis on Bourne, most notably how his flashbacks are tormenting him and how Marie represents his humanity and the choice of living. And upon her death, his quest for revenge sets Bourne on a journey to find his past and some eventual answers to what's been troubling him.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />More interactive PiP applications that play during the film:<br /><br />- The Bourne Dossier<br />Same as the Treadstone Files option in Identity. It's just a bunch of statistics and factoids in the form of a gimmicky spy computer thingy for people, places, and certain situations. It's cool if you like trivia, but like I said, it's a bit of a novelty, if anything else.<br /><br />- Bourne Orientation<br />Recaps of important plot points, though not in the sense of interviews like the actual PiP commentary. It's a bit redundant and totally okay to skip it.<br /><br />- Picture in Picture<br />The real meat of the extras. It's actually quite humorous at the beginning when producer Frank Marshall says that the feature was made exclusively for \\"this HD-DVD,\\" which obviously is a dead format now, but after that it's pure gold in terms of information. The PiP takes most of the footage from the other special features listed above. However, it also includes a very large amount of interviews and footage not included in said extras and is full of crucial commentary and analysis of the story itself, as well as a few anecdotes from cast and crew. Most of the feature has the actors breaking down their characters and talking about what it was like working with one another. I was very glad to hear interpretations from Brian Cox and Karl Urban, who play antagonists, but really don't get a whole lot of screen time in general to fully develop themselves. So to hear them talking about how the characters fit into the plot and what they thought about their roles was very interesting. This is by far the best special feature on this disc, and I wholly recommend you make it a mandatory watch if you're interested in the production of the film itself and its literary composition. And unlike the PiP in Identity, this one actually runs for the entire length of the movie, as opposed to 3-5 minute chunks for 8 chapters.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />While the franchise is changing directors at this point, the plot still continues to thicken. I find it to be an interesting take on the character of Jason Bourne. And to further iterate, I really, really thank the people involved because without the Bourne movie franchise, James Bond wouldn't have followed suit, and I don't think I would love the Daniel Craig movies as much as I do today. In the meantime, Universal presents Supremacy with some demo-worthy A/V specs and a deceptively informative set of extras. Do yourself a favor and get ready for a spy-thriller with a lot of heart, then prepare for an even more thrilling adventure in the final act, Ultimatum.
0345803507|1.0|I'm sorry I bought these books. This is by far the most boring series I have ever read. What keeps you going is the curiosity of what is wrong (and there's a lot wrong) with the main male character and his friend with the pedophilia-like tendencies; there's a fine line between cougar and cradle robber which she clearly crossed. Other than that, there was nothing else to keep your interest.
B008CP93S0|1.0|I was so disappointed in this movie.  We never would have pegged 2 stars like Aniston and Rudd would be in such a low class, B type movie.  At one point Rudd has a scene where he is talking into a mirror, he goes on and on and on and on, it is painful watch.  So distasteful.  Don't waste your time or money.

034580404X|5.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed reading these books.  Our local tele-<br />vision station featured a segment about a women's book club that was reading<br />\\"50 Shades of Grey\\".  That got me interested in the book, and I ordered it for<br />my Kindle.  Ana and Christian are wonderful characters.  He is much more com-<br />plex than she is, but she is mature beyond her years.<br /><br />I love Christian's interaction with his family...his \\"parents\\" are really cool<br />and amazingly understanding.  Ana's relationship with her stepfather and her<br />mother make for interesting reading.<br /><br />At first I didn't understand why two additional books were needed to tell their story, but I really enjoyed the second and third books, and I like the<br />way everything was explained.  The \\"ending\\" was wonderful and exactly what I<br />was hoping for.<br /><br />I am so glad that I got to \\"meet\\" Ana and Christian and read and enjoy their<br />story.
B00275EHJG|4.0|The final film in a trilogy of movies about a group of beloved toys, who come to life when no people are around, and find their fulfillment in being played with.  The main characters are the cowboy Woody, the cowgirl Jesse and the space ranger action figure Buzz Lightyear, and when their owner, Andy, has grown old enough to go to college, he's forced to make a choice; throw his old toys away, put them in the attic, give them away, or take them with him.<br /><br />Through a series of misunderstandings and tragic occurrances, the toys all end up being donated to a day care center, where toys can just keep being played with by new kids every year.  However, the toy bear who runs the place; Lots-o, tricks the main characters and tries to force them into the toddler room; where the children have no understanding of how to treat toys, and no respect for their playthings.<br /><br />When Woody realizes that his friends are in trouble, he finds himself having to perform a daring secret mission to rescue them from the mafia-boss-like teddy bear, and fix his friend Buzz; who's been severely brainwashed by them.<br /><br />Part of the reason for the grade I give this movie is that it has little or no philosophy to teach; no real lessons to learn, or morals to the story, exactly; at least none that are clear.  Another reason is that really, this is a kids' movie.  Not all pixar movies are that, but this has been consistent, anyway, throughout the Toy Story series.<br /><br />The movie uses a lot of cliches about mobs, gangsters and prison breaks, and applies them to toys, which is certainly odd, but workable.  The characters, for the most part, are predictable, and there are no real curve balls in the story.  Everything plays out pretty much exactly as you expect it to.<br /><br />There's a Ken doll in this film, who falls for a Barbie doll, and is torn between his love for her and his loyalty to the gang.  There's a running joke about this character being somewhat effeminate,which almost threatens to become tasteless, but never quite gets there.  On the whole, I'm somewhat up in the air about him.  I didn't find him particularly funny, but neither did I find him offensive, nor problematic for young children.<br /><br />I did feel that the whole mafia motif only worked marginally well.  Frankly, I think including it in a kid's film at all was a bit much, but it doesn't ruin the movie or anything.  It's still fun.  I just felt a little uncomfortable with it.<br /><br />On the whole, however, this is another movie about the toy story characters having fun and going on adventures, and it does that reasonably well.  It builds tension where tension is needed, has good humor where good humor is needed, and is just entertaining and exciting overall.<br /><br />I don't think this movie has any major shortcomings to speak of, but one thing I did notice was that where the first two films focused on developing the characters of Woody, Buzz and Jesse, this one has almost no development on the part of any of them.  They go through tough times and harrowing adventures, but as people, they don't really change.<br /><br />The one character who seems to get the most focus in the villain; Lots-o, and he's where the film makes its story happen; comparing the villain's own development to that of healthier-minded toys.  What follows from this is...  Well, I won't give it away, but to sum it up, the last two films wrapped character development in adventure.  This one is more of a character -study- wrapped in adventure.  There's no real development to speak of.<br /><br />And it's not as though they couldn't have included some.  Woody, in this film, faces the hard reality of his owner having grown up, and no longer needing him; the very same reality that Jesse faced in the last film; yet not a word is shared between them about it.  As I said, it was still a good film, but if this kind of opportunity had been taken advantage of, it would have been the icing onthe cake.

Decent music and the concept is simple and slightly different than say Quell and Quell Reflect.  You get graded on how few moves it takes to reach the goal.
1582701903|5.0|Ruth L. Miller offers an easy to understand, updated, edited version Of the Master Key System along with the original text. This allows me to compare, clearly visualize and internalize the information. I have read the original text previously, presented by others, but this has been a much easier read and I'm enjoying comparing the editor's concept of each chapter with the original.<br /><br />This is good work by Ruth L. Miller. I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn of the Master Key, as presented by Charles F. Haanel.

B000FC2ROU|5.0|Understandably, this book inspires some seriously long reviews.  All you really need to know is this:<br /><br />- Murakami did the translation himself, which means the writing conforms as closely to the original intent as possible.  Obviously, this is fairly rare for international literature.<br />- It's magical realism.  Don't expect it all to make perfect sense in the moment.<br />- The book is full of plot twists that aren't telegraphed chapters in advance.<br />- Maybe incest is a central theme of the book, and maybe it's all just a trick of time and perception.<br />- Not one single word or element is wasted.<br />- You need not be versed in metaphysics, WWII-era Japan, or Japanese mythology to enjoy the book, but it really helps.<br />- There is a seriously gruesome scene involving one of the main characters and cats that's best skimmed for the weak of stomach.<br />- Murakami is the antidote to modern literature from native English speakers who mistake a clever story for a meaningful one.
B000TGZPOQ|2.0|Anyone who purchased this album years ago will wince at the errors in the remaster, entire words missing from 'Countdown' and the remakes on the 2nd half of the album blows.  I'd rather listen to Ween.  Recommend if you are a true Megadeth fan is buy nothing but the original soundtrack, not the remasters or remakes.
B003XE3HA0|5.0|I bought these to replace a previous pair of the same model that I bought last year and really liked. I like these better, the previous fit was too loose for me but apparently Crocs has improved the design and these ones fit great. It is really a size 7 and not too wide. The straps stay in place. Very comfy and cute for the summer. I would recommend this pair of shoes to friends.

I even read sitting on the floor next to an outlet so I could charge and read at the same time! It makes so much sense to buy the Omnibus because once you read the first book, you will have to go right to the second (and so on). My only disappointment was when it was over--I have to know what happens next!!
0156711427|5.0|While not my favorite Forster story, this is still perhaps my favorite Forster novel.  If you consider his articulated and thorough denouncement of British Imperialism in the context of India at the turn of the last century, the power of the book really comes through.  As ever, Forster's language flows like fine silk.  His characters are all accessible and understandable.  And of course, no one explains the muddle of human emotion and chronicles his characters' escape from it quite like Forster.

B001NBEWN6|5.0|The central characters of the story are twin children whose lives are chronicled as they lead up to an epic tragedy.  Set in post-Partition India, it is filled with the requisite historical drama and lushly described locations.  The passages given over to the description of the plantation and pickle factory at which most of the action takes place are crisp and vivid in the extreme.<br /><br />Roy perfectly captures not only the mentation of children, but the way they use, understand, misunderstand, and play with language to shape their worlds.  Other reviews are more willing to give you a blow-by-blow of the story, but suffice it to say, the tale is a tragedy through and through.  In particular, it's a historical tragedy, which is a personal favorite of mine.<br /><br />Despite being steeped in tragedy upon sadness upon injustice, Roy recounts his characters' lives in a way that skirts melodrama.  They are human and utterly relatable, even though the depth and breadth of their suffering is almost beyond comprehension.  A rare story of its kind that leaves you feeling hopeful rather than maudlin.

B0080BFWE0|4.0|I was so looking forward to getting this movie on Blu-Ray to add to my \\"Weekend Party Movies\\" collection, and now that I've got it, and watched it, I am very disappointed with the picture quality. 1080p, High Definition?  I don't think so. The quality here looks like a typical 480p standard DVD.<br /><br />Now, it may be an improvement over the previous DVD release, but it just doesn't look like they applied any effort to sharpen the imaging in the film.  Everything still has that slight soft blurring that you generally see with your average DVD's.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray film is released by Touchstone Home Entertainment. They haven't released a lot of Blu-Ray films yet.  The only other Touchstone film I have on Blu-Ray is \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, I'll be watching this Blu-Ray only on my 32\\" TV, where I watch only my standard DVD's, because a smaller screen gives a bad picture a better chance of looking improved.  This is the first Blu-Ray disc that I've bought where I have to make that decision.  This Blu-Ray disc of \\"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion\\" just doesn't look good on a larger TV.<br /><br />Maybe they'll remaster this film better when they re-release it as a 20th Anniversary Edition.  Somehow, I see that coming as a profitable intention on their part.

B003G4W49C|5.0|When I chose this book to read I had never heard about the Ender series.  I didn't know that I was about to read a book that creates such a world that you start to believe that at some point our world could get to that point.  If you are looking for an action sci fi book that really raises some questions about yourself and your moral belief system , then look no further.  This book will get your head moving and enough action that it will have you thinking at 2am, \\"just one more chapter\\".

B00000DCHI|5.0|Like some others have said, this collection peaks at his high point of his career.  The tracks \\"You're Only Human\\" and \\"The Night is Still Young\\" are the two tracks that he recorded in 1985 which only appeared in this collection, and they were both excellent swansongs to the end of my interest in Billy Joel.<br /><br />Yes, there are other Billy Joel collections out there that make up for some of his other neglected tracks, but I know I'd never get a perfect \\"Volume Three\\" of his best hits because I personally didn't care for his later eighties tracks, and beyond.  And honestly too, I don't really care much for \\"Goodnight Saigon\\" but apparently Billy likes it. I do appreciate that they put two really good non-hits in this collection (I believe at the time of first issue) were included as bonus tracks for the CD, but not available on the vinyl or cassette release: the tracks \\"Captain Jack\\" and \\"Scenes From an Italian Restaurant.\\"<br /><br />So this released collection of Volumes One and Two, plays nicely along side of my own personally gathered together \\"Volume Three\\", because I wanted to include some of his non-hits that received great airplay back on FM Rock stations in Detroit. His album \\"52nd Street\\" was a Detroit favorite, better than \\"The Stranger\\".<br /><br />So, my Volume Three includes the neglected few of his pre-1985 hits such as \\"Honesty\\", \\"Sometimes a Fantasy\\", \\"An Innocent Man\\", \\"Leave a Tender Moment Alone\\", and \\"Keeping The Faith\\".<br /><br />But, my personal \\"Volume Three\\" also included some great none hits from Billy Joel, such as \\"Vienna\\", \\"Everybody Has a Dream\\", \\"Stiletto\\", \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\", \\"Half a Mile Away\\", and \\"Zanzibar\\".<br /><br />This best of Billy Joel, Volume One and Two, was released in the early days of the new Compact Disc medium at the time.  You will notice that, back then, they gave many shortened single versions of some of the songs.  When they re-issued this CD in 1998, they gave us all the album versions. So, if you've bought your copy of this collection before 1998, then you should re-purchase it to get all the album versions.<br /><br />A few of his later hits (after 1985) like \\"Modern Woman\\", \\"A Matter of Trust\\", \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\", \\"I Go to Extremes\\", and even \\"The River of Dreams\\", I can do without.

B0085Z3B2Q|1.0|It might be okay as a stand alone film, but the problem is that it is called \\"The Lorax.\\" Based on the book by Dr. Seuss, but only very loosely. It takes audacious liberties, even for a film adaptation, and crunches the actual content of the book into maybe 3 minutes of screen time in a 90 minute romp. Ridiculously anti-corporate, despite the fact that other Lorax adaptations have admitted that while they can be self interested, they are rarely flat-out, one dimensional evil entities. Ironic, also, considering all the corporate tie-ins. The Lorax apparently no longer speaks for the trees, but Mazda and iHop and Theatre AMC. Some people might like it and think it's harmless, and they are perfectly entitled to that opinion. I wouldn't have such a beef with it except that it is called the Lorax, when it should really be called \\"Extra money so I can finish Despicable Me 2 on time.\\" Actually, that may be a little harsh. This movie was clearly made by someone who loved the book or the 1972 adaption, but who missed a crucial message in there somewhere and made a Captain Planet movie instead. It is a watered-down kids movie with bright colors, cooing animals, celebrity voices, evil 1984-style corporations, and not much impact. It will hold your children's gaze for 90 minutes, but if you want them to get something out of it in terms of a good message, you might want to look elsewhere.

0670022411|5.0|This book was FABULOUS! It had a ton of Historical and Scientific references as well as the Philosophers stone's books and the Bible used by Diana in reference to her Alchemy research. Sounds boring right? Well ITS NOT! Diana also happens to be a witch, who because of the death of her parents has decided to NOT do magic. But she uses it a lot more than she realizes. When she meets Matthew she falls in love with him. However, Matthew is a vampire. and Vampires, Witches and Daemons are NOT to socialize what-so-ever because it would draw them out into the humans eye. The twists and turns and the excitement in this book are fabulous. The storyline is engaging and entertaining. You will laugh, cry and scream in frustration. And when the story ends you are left screaming NOOOOOOOOOO you can't end here, come on give me the next book!!!! I HIGHLY recommend this book to ANYONE who loves anything to do with the paranormal, religions, science, history, awww heck ANYONE who can read!!!!!<br /><br />Now on to the story...<br /><br />The book begins with Diana doing research in the Library, she calls up a book which is enchanted and has been \\"lost\\" for a century at least. The book is in HIGH demand by the other world creatures: Vampires, Witches, Daemons. She of course doesn't know this, since she has been avoiding magic and anything to do with magic. She blindly opens the book, takes a few notes and returns the book to the library. In enters Matthew, an enigmatic Vampire who is absolutely gorgeous to anyone who sees him but emits this full of power stay away vibe to everyone.  Diana is drawn to him at first because he can protect her from the creatures who are flocking to the library since she opened the book, and in part because of this attraction she feels and the safety he offers her.<br /><br />The story takes a few twists and turns when Diana is threatened by the Witches for her association with the Vampire Matthew. It becomes even more apparent that not all is as it seems when a photo of her parents appears at her home after the subtle threats of harm should she not do as she is told.<br /><br />Matthew takes matters into his own hands and takes Diana to his home in France where she meets his \\"mother\\".<br />She finally admits she loves him, and he admits that he loves her and this is where the story becomes more than just the Romeo and Juliet tale we expected. In walks danger, and death, in the form of Satu who tries desperately to get the information about the book from Diana, but only succeeds in making everyone aware that Diana isn't just ignoring her magic its been spellbound by her parents to protect their young daughter.<br /><br />I won't put any more spoilers in so as not to destroy your story, however, this book leaves you screaming WHERE IS THE NEXT BOOK!!!!when a photo of her parents appears at her home after the subtle threats of harm should she not do as she is told.<br /><br />Matthew takes matters into his own hands and takes Diana to his home in France where she meets his \\"mother\\".<br />She finally admits she loves him, and he admits that he loves her and this is where the story becomes more than just the Romeo and Juliet tale we expected.

B0079XPUOW|3.0|This book takes a great concept that anyone who knows sci-fi is familiar with, redshirts, and aks what happens when redshirts start noticing their strangely high mortality rate.<br /><br />The first part of the book, which deals with the redshirts figuring out that they are a remarkably high chance of dying on any away mission, is great.  Where the book starts to slow down is when they get to explaining why this is occurring.  My problem is that the \\"why\\" is never adequately explained.  It is difficult to explain without spoilering but basically they figure out why it is happening and devise a way to stop it but we never find out how it started happening in the first place.  A bit of sloppy narrative.  Scalzi had a good idea but just didn't flesh it out enough for my tastes.<br /><br />All in all it turns out to be an average sci-fi book involving an above average concept that I can't help feeling could have had more done with it.
0143119680|2.0|When I first heard of \\"A Discovery of Witches\\", I honestly felt like the premise sounded kind of ridiculous. More vampires? And he becomes interested in a bookish girl who can't seem to protect herself? How daring! I didn't pick up the book. And then the paperback came out, slathered in good reviews from People, USA Today, Oprah's Book Club, and so I gave it a chance.<br /><br />I give Harkness credit for her surprisingly deft writing. I felt like she describes London, Oxford, and her characters very well. I found the idea of alchemy, DNA, and Ashmole 782 rather intriguing. Unfortunately, the rest of the novel's plot doesn't hold up to such scrutiny. In 579 pages, Diana Bishop does little more than drink tea, faint, do some vaguely magical things that have no bearing on the plot, and complain about how no one lets her defend herself. Matthew, on the other hand, does nothing but attempt to keep her locked up in a room while he does everything for her, much like Edward and Bella from \\"Twilight\\". Also like Edward, Matthew is a shadow of what a vampire should be. He never drinks blood, we never see him do anything supernatural, or even really super. It's as though Harkness just decided to make her characters supernatural just because it seemed \\"interesting\\". I'm kind of appalled that more women aren't offended by this. Although Harkness tries to make Diana seem interesting by having her constantly protest that she can protect herself, it's clear that she's another dopey female protagonist meant only to be protected by the Big, Strong Man.<br /><br />Harkness would have had more success with this first novel if she had spent less time describing tea and sweaters, and more time actually expanding the science, history, and personalities of her characters. ADoW ended up feeling like \\"Twilight\\" with a thin veneer of genetic science to make it seem more intelligent.

0810945797|5.0|If you're a fan of the movie Dark Crystal, you'll love this book. It contains a lot of background to the story we saw in the movie, vastly expanding upon the world of Thra. The artwork is concept art Brian Froud drew for the movie, but rather than just create a \\"making of the movie\\" book, this book integrates the art into the story. The text comes from the background material Jim Henson and Brian Froud drafted when writing the script. We learn more about the urSkeks and why they split into the urRu and Skeksis. A lot of the text describes the symbols in the movie, circles and triangles. I didn't find these parts of the book as interesting, although I was impressed with how much though Froud and Henson gave to creating a world. I did really enjoy the brief character sketches of each of the urRu and Skeksis. They're given more personality than what we get to glimpse into the movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book is very hard to find nowadays. It costs a small fortune in the secondary market. As such, I'd really only recommend it for diehard fans of the film. If you just want more stories from Thra, also check out the new Myths of Darth Crystal comics.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This is the story of a few iconoclasts who saw the masters of our financial universe happily building a house of cards whose collapse has caused such widespread human misery to everybody but them.  The book is entertaining, funny and absolutely infuriating, especially since nobody's in jail and the same sociopaths who demonstrated that they would enthusiastically destroy countless people's lives, as long as they got rich in the process, are still driving the world financial industry.  And the government has still not provided any disincentive to keep them from doing it again.  So of course they will.  There are $350 trillion dollars of derivatives out there (based on a fraud known as the LIBOR), whose only reason for existence is to generate commissions for those who create, buy and sell them.  There's a cliff up ahead.  Better buy some land and learn to raise your own food.

0061544493|4.0|It is always a treat to see what VB is wearing and her various fashion lines put out some great designs, so I was very excited that she wrote this book and couldn't wait to read it. In addition, it has one of the best book covers and titles \\"That Extra Half an Inch\\" could apply to many things in life (get your mind out of the gutter, I'm referring to perseverance...maybe).<br /><br />The book has little bits of style advice. Much of the advice you have probably heard somewhere before. However, the reason to buy this book is for the list of resources. Most of the list of resources are reserved only for the 1% (you mean Manolo Blahnik makes the best shoes, well put me down for 10 of them). Apart from that, there were plenty of stores, brands, and websites that I have not heard of that are now bookmarked in my Google Chrome internet browser.<br /><br />In particular, there are numerous great resources in the lingerie and beauty sections of the book. She also made a really good point that if you are unable to splurge on designer clothing, you can get your designer packaging \\"fix\\" by buying some designer label beauty items and cosmetics.<br /><br />Overall, glad I got the book. Now if I could just get my bangs to look like hers. Bloody hell, that is never going to happen.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|Honestly I've been laughing with my friends for years at the music video of Wuthering Heights and at the disjointed moves Kate Bush calls dancing, I always thought there's a homeless lady right there. Until some day when I found myself humming the song and being curious, I listened to the whole album. It was very good, and then another one and so on, years later, to this one. I never wanted to go where Kate Bush is taking me but once I get there I always like the place. This album does that heavily. If you're into choruses, intros, bridges and all those song writing recipes everybody uses, you probably won't feel at home at all listening to this one. But if you say: \\"to hell with what I'm supposed to hear\\" and just go with the music, you will be surprised with every new measure. What follows is never what you expected but always surprising and interesting. Not listening to this album at least once means missing the chance to feel stuff I, at least, seldom feel, I would call it: \\"the glory of feeling miserable\\". This album doesn't intend to have any hits on it and doesn't wrap the nice stuff in fillers. Every measure is of equal importance and whatever song you chose and wherever you start listening the good stuff flows right in. It's a love it or hate it album, and I love it. It's not only one of her best albums but one of the best I've heard in a very long time. Actually I don't know what genre this music is supposed to be, it has songs on it like any meat and potato album but emotion wise it's closer to Puccini than ABBA.
B0081TZUAW|4.0|What can I say:  I like this album.  It's not deep, it's not necessarily original.  But it's solid music, with catchy tunes, and the trademark Garbage sound that was enjoyable before, and is enjoyable again.  This is an album that holds my interest enough to want to listen to it a few times a week, as background music at work.  If you like decent rockin' tunes and a strong female lead singer, you'll like this too.

034580404X|5.0|I must admit that I went into reading this trilogy with some skepticism.  I heard so much about this series (mixed reviews), however I have read all three books and I'm an instant fan of E L James.  I love her imagination and the ability to write such detailed fantasy/erotic material.  I was completely connected and engaged in every book.  Kudos to this author that has taken America by storm with this trilogy!!  I'm anxiously awaiting her next project.  I would highly recommend this this product to anyone.<br /><br />P.S. - My husband loved the experience after my reading these books (LOL).  Thanks for the extra spice to my intimate relationship.

030758836X|5.0|I'm a big fan of Gillian Flynn.  Love her writing, love the razor sharp wit, love the dark tone, love the flawed characters...heck, I love the profanity.  This is a great novel.  Smart, well-plotted, clever, and hugely entertaining.<br /><br />Flynn does so many things well and while many of the big twists were predictable in some cases, they were sprung at unexpected times and led the novel into different directions than I expected.  One big twist, that I was certain would be revealed at the end of the novel occurred half way through which proved far more interesting than the trajectory I thought she was on.<br /><br />While this is genre fiction, it is elevated in its commentary on the complex relationships that exist between men and women and children and their parents.  While it is first and foremost an entertaining thriller, there are unexpectedly astute observations on these pages.<br /><br />While I lavish this novel with praise, I have to qualify my enthusiasm by making it clear that not everyone will appreciate this novel.  In fact, some people will really hate it (evidenced by the significant number of 1 star ratings it has received).  My hope is that I can help you decide if you're going to love this novel or hate it.<br /><br />Ask yourself:  How do you feel about novels where the major characters are flawed and perhaps even unlikeable?  Are you a reader who needs characters you can \\"root for?\\"  Is it important to you that you like a protagonist and that there a `good guy (or gal)' - a hero who will prevail in the end?  If so, this probably isn't the book for you.  On the other hand, if you like the lines between good and bad to be a little blurry, you like seriously flawed characters and you appreciate a novel that isn't afraid to be cynical and nasty, Gone Girl may be up your alley.<br /><br />The ending of this novel is another potential source of disappointment for some readers (although I loved the ending).  If you want a novel to deliver a satisfying feeling of justice served, you may want to avoid this novel.  The ending of Gone Girl, without giving too much away, is atypical of genre fiction.  It's the kind of ending that you might find in a literary novel that isn't compelled to placate readers expecting a prescribed outcome.<br /><br />This novel isn't going to appeal to everyone, but for those of us who appreciate a profanity laden, smart, well-written, cleverly plotted, dark, nasty suspense novel that manages to entertain as well provide social commentary on relationships and the roles we play it doesn't get much better than this.  4 ½ stars.ng feeling of justice served, you may want to avoid this novel.

0345803485|2.0|The book, because of its bad grammar, lazy writing style, non-use of proper story mechanics and lousy editing, wasn't worth it. It is an adult book with scenes of pornography, but take that away and there is no substance. There is very little honest character development (if you don't count how \\"alive\\" and \\"awakened\\" the main character felt during intercourse) and the actual premise of the book got old after a couple of chapters. I finished the entire thing and am not at all impressed. If i could get a refund, I would.

B00006CXSS|1.0|I have seen and read many documentaries on WWII. Many of them are excellent. The best in my opinion is \\"The World at War\\" narrated by Laurence Olivier and done in the early 1970s.<br /><br />This dramatization by HBO is fair in my estimation. Unfortunately, the script seems to have been written by someone who never got over being a foul-mouthed adolescent. I don't care how much some may say that soldiers talked crudely and this is reality - I object to being presented with a made up script where the F word dominates much of the dialogue. Furthermore, there is one scene in Part 9 that is nothing but pornography. It was totally unnecessary and added nothing to the story. It didn't need to be there. I strongly object to HBO and other amoral movie makers producing this type of crap. The so called \\"documentary\\" could have been so much better with a more responsible script writer.

B003X73QA8|5.0|This absolutely amazing album is flawless throughout, easily the best album to come from these canadian indie rockers, and, in my opinion, the best album of the last 30 years. The album's opening song and the one that gives it its name, The Suburbs, is incredibly catchy, with a happy beat, but somewhat regretful lyrics of the days of yore. It then flows perfectly into Ready to Start, an energetic piece that caught my attention, causing me to buy this album two years ago. It's that good. After that, the songs flow seamlessly into one another, weaving a story of teenagers living in a passionless city at war. Month of May, then comes along just about forcing you to get up and flail your limbs around. We Used to Wait, the album's second radio hit, is arguably the best song on the album, with perfectly woven instrumentals, nostalgic lyrics, and an energy build that you can't help, but join into. despite how I highlighted just those few songs, every single song on this album is nothing short from amazing. If this album is missing from your collection, buy it now, you won't regret it one bit.

B000FBJAEG|3.0|I normally enjoy the books by David Baldacci and this one wasn't bad, it just wasn't all that good either.  I was a little worried when, early in the story, a mystery person was driving a Buick Impala.  E-edition editing problem maybe?<br /><br />The story tried to tie together two Secret Service Agents from two different incidents, over different presidential campaigns.  It was pretty convoluted.  Throughout the story, with all the characters that were involved, the investigations leading nowhere or to other questions, the bad guys were ahead--outsmarting and out maneuvering the good guys.  Not only was that kind of frustrating, but I figured out who the mastermind was way before our intrepid heroes.  The ending was weird and illogical.  Why would anyone go to that much trouble for no appreciable gain?<br /><br />I'll probably read more by Baldacci, but this one was a bit disappointing.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author kept me engaged so much so that I couldn't put my Kindle down! After a couple very late nights reading after work, the book was over and  I wanted more.

The characters are extremely well developed and the way the author writes will bring even the most prudish person to a glorious climax.<br />The chemistry between the two main characters, Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, seems to pour from page to page.  Even though their relationship is extremely complicated, the reader hopes they can find a way for it to work.  This book will leave you as wanton as a sub being tied down!
B000BMYWYC|5.0|I got this for my gundam and its amazing. Its good for pretty much any plastic model. Just wait for it to dry thats wat i learned the hard way. I was glueing red frane astray kai v fin on and  i was playing around with the red frame till i moved it and had to glue it back on. You have to wait atleast overnight for it to dry and cure. When gluing things together make sure to squeeze out the excess because it will glue with a gap in between thats not seen by the naked eye. once u squeeze out the excess you will see the melted plastic oozing out. You can sand it off once it dries. Overall it is a must have for me and my gundam.

The sexual parts of the book didn't bother me as I am an married female adult and know that some couples love this kind of thing.  I was more intrigued by the fact that he loved her all along and never knew it.  Despite all of Christians imperfections he loved and needed her perfectly.  Its a novel for adults that understand that everyone loves differently.  And besides, we all should re-evaluate our love lives every once in a while, you never know what you will become open to.  Loved it, wish there would have been 10 more books to the series.  Read all 3 in a week, was completely hooked from the first page!
B0071NLG0W|4.0|Amber is just a fun heroine. She's witty, smart, and can kick some major butt without any help. There's really nothing not to love about this series. I really wasn't sure if I would like the vodoo theme, but really it's done quite well, and and I really liked the mystery of what happened to Chantal. For me though, what has really won me over about this series are the secondary characters. They are wonderfully funny, zaney, and lovable. I have to say it's a toss up as to who my favorite is: Tia, the receptionist, Ambers Dad or Marmalade the cat. However, there is one character who tops them all: Brad. I love how he lets Amber do her own thing, but still has her back at all times. He's just so sigh worthy.<br /><br />T.here are so many twists and turns that as soon as I thought I had the mystery figured out something else would happen and I would have to start all over again trying to figure out who was behind everything.  The list of suspects is long and it's not long before Amber finds herself in tough situations. No matter how smelly or awful things get, she pulls through like a trooper.<br /><br />This is one of the best mystery series I've read in a long time, and I can't wait to read more mysteries with Amber and the gang.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I actually missed this show the first time around.  I caught it when it was replayed this past spring.  I knew I had to have the DVD when it came out.  The writing is great - if you talk or do something else, you'll miss a lot of the lines and humor.  I'll definitely be buying Season Two when it is released!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Okay, so I picked this up to read it because I'd heard about the movie coming out and wanted to see what the fuss is about.And I read right through it and through both sequels in pretty short order.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: the book is a LOT better than the movie! Do yourself a favor and read the book, leave the movie for one of those nights you're flipping channels and can't find anything else to watch. Yes, the movie is that bad.<br /><br />Which is a shame, because The Hunger Games is a book that seems ready-made for being made into a movie. One thing I will give Suzanne Collins credit for, she can write some very dramatic sequences. I read this book and thought, wow, I can't wait to see how that looks on the big screen. And I was terribly disappointed. The movie was just flat, flat, flat. If I'd seen the movie before reading the book, I probably wouldn't have bothered with the book.<br /><br />For those that liked the movie, I will offer this example. Read the portion where Petra confesses his love of Katniss on Caesar's TV show. Now watch the movie version. Can you honestly say it is anywhere near as dramatic? I was stunned that the director ruined what was such a tailor-made moment. I could give a lot more examples.<br /><br />Anyone with a lick of sense will see where this series is going but as has been said many times before, sometimes the fun is how you get there not where you end up! There is a fair amount of silliness, particularly the Twilight-like flailings of the protagonist and her inability to decide whether she loves Petra or Gale. And yet, the book does manage to hold your attention. And it has those wonderfully written dramatic moments!<br /><br />What did I like? It's a quick read. The premise is interesting. Some dramatic moments that are very well written. I also appreciated the angst suffered by Katniss, both in this novel and the sequels, resulting from the killing she witnesses or is responsible for. Too many times novels like this tend tobrush off violence and repercussions, the characters don't see to dwell on what they've done. This series, to it's credit, does not do that. Katniss suffers considerably for her choices and actions (as do some of the other victors).<br /><br />Bottom line: it's a good summer beach read. The book is recommended, the movie is decidedly NOT.
B0063GORYU|5.0|l love this version; it is User friendly easy on the eyes a pleasure to play. the helpful hints are the best.
0756405890|2.0|Yes, while most praise this novel as being incredible not only for fantasy, but as a book in general, especially a debut, I just couldn't get into it.<br /><br />Now, I've heard a few complaints about the book before I read it (not nearly as often as I heard praise, so don't worry, I wasn't really tainted) and from what I understand, people who dislike it tend to do so because Kvothe is a \\"perfect character\\".  I completely disagree with this.  Kvothe is an incredibly talented man who can solve many problems with relative ease.  Now, I don't mind that kind of character.  I think the \\"superman\\" character can be interesting.<br /><br />But... they have to be put in the right situation.  They can't just face ordinary problems, because obviously they're going to overcome those problems with ease.  This is the biggest problem in Rothfuss's story.  Kvothe never faces anything that truly challenges him.  He needed to go up against something on an epic scale, but all we get to do is see him take on things that aren't really all that challenging.  We don't need the story of how he excelled at everything.  Rothfuss could have summed that up in a relatively brief amount of time.<br /><br />What defines a character and what draws an audience to him or her is conflict--genuine conflict where the character struggles for a notable length of time (longer than just one chapter, which is how long most of the conflicts in this book are).  They need to struggle and learn and stumble and fall a few times before succeeding.  And they need a challenge that's appropriate for their abilities and personality.  For instance, Kvothe needed to face off against someone just as powerful as him, or maybe face something that he couldn't solve through his normal means.  The guy has a motivation--a couple, actually, which is good.  He also has a defining flaw, arrogance, also very good.  He has a nice childhood backstory, too.  But that means nothing without conflict.<br /><br />No conflict, no character.  No character, no story.<br /><br />Rothfuss also suffers from \\"fantasy prose syndrome\\", which is something I just coined right here, so I'll explain what it is.  It means that he writes more for pretty language than actual good prose.  He relies too heavily on adverbs and subsequently lacks concrete detail in a lot of places.  He also has a penchant for throwing out \\"fantasy names\\" for countries and places without really helping us understand what and where they are.  Now, doing that every once in a while is fine--characters in a fantasy world will reference things us reader don't know about, because hey, they live there--but it happens too often, and it creates a sense of a throw-away world.  It's like he's just naming things to make it seem like he's fleshed this place out, but in reality he hasn't really thought the world through.<br /><br />There are a few solid parts, of course, but they're few and far between.  Don't expect to feel much emotion from this book.  It just feels like a bunch of stuff that happens rather than a story.  Rothfuss needs to understand conflict.  He needs to understand that even Superman faces challenges.
B005H29GSI|5.0|I bought this for my Niece's tenth birthday, and she just loves it! Another reviewer had mentioned pairing this with the 12 pc [[ASIN:B007K9OCYO New Set of 12 PCs Iphone Game Angry Birds Green Pigs PVC Figures]] (there are a few to choose from, actually) to give this game more &#34;ammo&#34;, which I did. She is a tactile learner and has had some learning difficulties, so the cards provided are helping strengthen her visual learning as well as the fine motor development from setting up the game. My sister told me she played with it every day nonstop for over a week! Great product
0345803485|3.0|If this book would of had less sex it would have been much better.  The story line is great, but give me a break a virgin would not be able to have sex three times in a row.  My husband and I have listened to the audio book as we have drove across country and even he said that it has too much sex.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|Here is possibly the best album put out by Alexander, either as a solo or with Edward Sharp and Magnetic zeroes.  Been a long time fan and this album has many enjoyable songs.  Nothing on here would be considered \\"B\\" side material.

B0081X40HW|5.0|Really wanted Oh My but decided to purchase the whole album and so glad I did. She has a great voice and I cannot stop listening to this collection.
0439023513|3.0|Just finished this book up yesteraday and wanted to take an evening to dig through my thoughts.<br /><br />Ultimately, I felt the book incomplete. As if there was a bigger underlying \\"somthing\\" but was skipped over. Perhaps, a better message speaking to our humanity, or government, or something, but it wasn't there. Other reviews have said it was rushed. I don't necesary think it was as rushed as just not thought out well. She was trying to do too much, while at the same time doing very little. And the ending just went on for too long. What happened to the empire could have been linked closer to what the end underlying current theme of the heinous of war and the correlating greek theology. Overall, the concept was good, just the execution left a lot to be desired. I am glad I read this book, I think more people should. But just come in with limited expectations.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|My son and I had just watched the first Iron Man movie a few weeks ago and we both really liked it. I've never been a fan of Downey, but he really fits the character.<br /><br />We tried this second installment and neither my 10 year old or I were really impressed. Mickey Rourke, although quite creepy even outside of the film, was a great bad guy. But Don Cheadle was not very impressive and the dynamic just wasn't there, in my opinion. Even the story seemed a little phoned in compared to the first movie.<br /><br />The special effects were cool and the simulated technologies in the movie were also amazing. That said, we felt the movie started to wear on us about half way through and can only give it 3 stars.
B008MEM24S|3.0|on Disney channel it says its free but its not for kindle fire all I'm asking for is the free version please get it fast or make it the free app for the day
B005ES0ZDU|4.0|I'd recommend these to Croc fence sitters like I was.  A pair of CVS $15 knock-offs got me wearing the ugly style, but after a good 4-years in those I figured I'd try the real deal.<br /><br />Score on construction: These are more stout and the material is better, but eerily similar to marshmallows left out and stale.<br /><br />Score on camo:  Point to the Duets because at least the two-tone disguises the basic ugliness of the shoe...but not everything is meant to be beautiful to look at.  Utility is beauty in function, and that's what these are.<br /><br />Score for heighteners:  These are like big truck tires, lifting my foot at least an inch.<br /><br />Score on form:  my toes already slip into welcoming divots of familiarity.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved the book. I found it comprable to the television series, but by far much better. Would definitely recommend this book.
030788743X|5.0|Hands down, this books is a page turner. While a cliche term, it is no less true. The novel is especially sweet for those of us lucky enough to have enjoyed the 80's and even some of the 90's--name dropping and references galore will hit you hard with nostalgia--and for those who have played MMO's and know the way an MMO works. The action is nicely ramped, so you don't get bored but you don't get overwhelmed, either. The characters are also a major hook to this book. Immediately, you can \\"get a feel\\" for them and feel a kinship with them--provided, of course, you, too, are into the retro videogame and movie scene. I highly recommend this book to any fan of good fiction, but if you're someone able to appreciate the classics and have a taste for all things nostalgia, this is a MUST read!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really appreciate all the different choices and the flexibility this app has. Best weather app I've seen. I would highly recommend it.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This was an easy read and a great story. An interesting tale of how cultural differences can pose challenges in a relationship and of how people often feel the need to know about their roots no matter how good things are for them. Also, a good example of how the grass always seems greener somewhere else and particularly when you are a teenager.  Very enjoyable book.
B008MM9630|5.0|good graphics and easy to play  . plants and animals look and play well. of all the farming games this is my favorite so far.
B007SGM084|3.0|I had heard a lot of talk about these books.  I choose to read them on that basis.  Although shocking and very graphic, I did enjoy the story line and the characters in the books.  In my opinion, the books would have been just as good without the dark sexual violence.
B003UBTX72|4.0|a well written and interesting look into the life of a rock legend.I found myself immersed in this book and would recommend it to others
B001DHIYBG|5.0|This is Agent Steel's second album and my second favorite by them behind Skeptics Apocalypse.  While the vocals are somewhat of an acquired taste, John Cyriis does an amazing job on this album. Classic thrash standouts include:  \\"Rager\\", \\"Unstoppable Force\\", and \\"Indestructive\\". Highly recommended!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great second book for the Hunger Games.  I couldn't put it down.<br />I ordered this on Kindle and it is so easy.  I also purchased book 3, \\"Mockingjay\\".<br />Read them all!
B00846REIS|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I started reading Bared To You. I'm a cover wh*re (read this book before the cover was changed to a more Fifty Shade-ish look) so the first thing that drew me was the cover. Second thing was that it was written by Sylvia Day. I love her historical romances so was happy at the chance to read a contemporary romance by her.<br /><br />Eva is starting her new life in Manhattan. She has a new job and is sharing an apartment with her BFF, Cary. Then Eva meets billionaire Gideon Cross and her simple, new life in Manhattan is turned upside down. Gideon is handsome, sexy, dynamic and he's also fighting his own demons. His past translates into him being a controlling, sometimes needy, borderline nut sack crazy stalker.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva's relationship is so dysfunctional it's like watching a train wreck. I was totally engrossed in their story and I could not put my Kindle down. With each turn of the page, I was anxious to see where the relationship was headed. I didn't like Gideon at the beginning and by the time I finished Bared to You, I still wasn't sure if I liked him. He is truly messed up and his issues manifests itself into controlling, stalkerish behavior that at times had me frightened for Eva.<br /><br />While reading Bared To You, I wasn't sure if I wanted Gideon and Eva to have a HEA. They both have so many issues and when they are together, both of their insecurities rise to the surface. Gideon brings out the jealous side of Eva and Eva brings out every bad thing you wouldn't want in a boyfriend in Gideon. But I must say, for all the issues, they are compatible in the bedroom. All that crazy equals some smoking hot sex scenes.<br /><br />Bared To You is an engrossing and sexy read. Again, I could not stop reading. Both the characters are such a hot mess and yet their relationship works, in some crazy, off way. Gideon and Eva's issues were not resolved in Bared To You. Thankfully there's a sequel and I hope that we learn more about Gideon's past. The story is told from Eva's 1st person POV so the information we get about Gideon is through Eva. We know, or can deduce, that he's a victim of abuse but we don't know who abused him. I hope to learn more about Gideon's family and his upbringing cause he had to experience some crazy shit to be such a successful man and be so insecure in his relationship.<br /><br />I highly recommend Bared To You. I've never been so engrossed in such a dysfunctional relationship.ore about Gideon's past. The story is told from Eva's 1st person POV so the information we get about Gideon is through Eva.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|Excellent.....interesting read and exciting and educational to learn the \\"back\\" story. Highly recommended to all regardless of your political affiliation.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It was extremely well written with a wonderful new twist to the same-o fantasy genre storyline.  The characters are brillantly fleshed out in a way that you immediately \\"see\\" them without a long, drawn out description.  But, what I really love is the re-telling of the world's cultural mythology.  Mr. Hearne brings in a little of them all in this series along with an amazing ability to sneak in poignant social commentaries throughout his prose.  Can't wait to read them all!!

B008EL4YX6|4.0|Very clever game design and fun to play. It did crash my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 once. It is very nice to see a game that supports tablet sceen size.
0345803485|2.0|I bought it recently in one of the airports before catching a 6 hours flight thinking it would substitute an upgrade I didn't get. Calling it a Harlequin romance for the iPhone generation would insult users of both (supposedly iconic for many) products.<br /><br />First of all, how can you enjoy allegedly sensual descriptions of epidermal pleasure if the only thing it does is making you burst in laughter? Every page sounds like a fallen attempt to convert a hard core Manga comic into a Boccaccio novel in a version for smartphones. If this is a New York Times best seller then I am scared to even think what would be on the \\"NY Post\\" list if they had one.<br /><br />I guess the only missing thing is a vibration mode for Kindle.<br /><br />I would give it one star only but, as a working professional, I am giving the second one for the...marketing campaign.

B008BM9L72|4.0|Just finished the third book on my kindle. Not the sort of books you can put down. The characters become very real. Christian the main character is a very colourful,controlling man. Ana who is maddly in love with him feels she has everything under control. Like another reader stated she had 'passive aggressive behaviour'. Her control was so much more subtle. She is constantly emotionally rescuing him, because of his horrific upbringing. He screws up her head daily, intimidates her to get whatever he wants,makes it difficult for her to see her friends,does not respect any of her boundaries. Ana justifies that the relationship is good and she just needs to try harder to understand him. When she thinks she can stand no more of his unpredictible behavour. He does the right things. But just to confuse her even more he buys her very expensive presents.  All classic signs of emotional abuse. Am I the only person who can recognise this ???  She puts up with this very bad behavour,because she feels so very sad about what happened to him as a child.  She plays right into his game, that he demonstrates whenever he can't get his own way. He does reform somewhat as the story goes on, this is a story afterall and not real life! My experience with men like this, is that they don't What worries me is; some young girls who read these books may think it is OK to be treated in this fashion, after all he loves her very much and buys her very expensive gifts. I feel the need to let women know this is not love.  He even does the right thing when he really has to. This is fiction not ' real life'. I hope that they will recognise this. Men like this rarely change and life is nothing but a turmoil when you are with them. I don't want to sound negative in this review because I really did find the three books very entertaining and I'm not talking about the sex scenes that I found very predictible and cheesy (I don't believe people have fantastic sex every single time)that part weakened the stories for me. Being relistic I doubt very much that this story, should it be true, would ever have a happy ending. Still it made great reading the way it was.
B001E57SH8|2.0|While this product works very well, the biggest problem I have with it is that the flame cannot be adjusted---a design feature included in just about any butane lighter I've come across.<br /><br />I also purchased the Zippo Outdoor Utility Lighter at the same time and there is a huge difference in the quality of construction.<br /><br />While the Utility Lighter is weighty and has solid controls, the Blue Vertical seems flimsy with a loose action and a tinny feel in the hand.<br /><br />Not my favorite Zippo product.
B008578PMU|4.0|I loved this movie. Great cast, great chemistry, great direction. Even my husband, who had no interest in watching it, ended up turning away from the computer to watch the movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its very addicting and cute. the secret to getting out of the game is to go to stuff, click on settings, and then click on the little door thats gonna be at the corner of the little box. you do not have to shut down ur kindle lol.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|...gawd I loved this story.  Here you've got this bad ass macho biker boy/Alpha Male (YOWZA!!) who is attracted to a gal who's attempting to be semi-geek(ish)...that is, she toes the College line.  She tries to avoid parties and the wrong crowds.  She just wants to finish College and pull good grades... and wants to fit into the upper sect. (cashmere sweaters, no parties etc.).  But that ain't her...not at all.  Travis Maddox is attracted to Abby Abernathy for all the wrong reasons [basically wanting to add her to his BAGGED LIST- -after all, he's the school stud!)... but instead becomes fast friends with her.....He learns to respect her and like her for the person she is.  Because she is not interested in him, he is drawn to her even more.  She fascinates and intrigues him.  Then he begins to capitulate and be attracted to her for all the right reasons (realizing such feelings were there from the beginning)...but feels unworthy and undeserving of one such as her.<br /><br />Travis portrays a person who is basically lonely and alone...no matter how many friends he has or Sorority Brothers he has... he does a good job making other's think he's happy as a clam and has it all - -and what he doesn't have he doesn't need/want.  Abby see's right through his facade [no spoilers please]..and without meaning to, she begins tearing down his walls.  She is his salvation and healing.<br /><br />This story captivated and held me prisoner.  I loved and connected with both characters and related to their angst.  This Author did an incredible job of reeling the reader in to their dilemma.  You'll laugh and cry...you'll smile and go \\"awww\\"...and you won't wanna put this story down!  So get your casseroles made before you sit down with this book....you're not gonna wanna cook!<br /><br />Such a punch-in-the-gut-wrenching ride!!  I'll enjoy reading this story over and over.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love, Love, Love this game!  It is so very addicting. Every level of the game is more & more challenging.  Makes you use your brain & think. Without a doubt worth getting this game, its a keeper on my kindle fire!
B00555X8OA|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for Kahneman to write this book. I was not disappointed! Great ideas and great story-teller.
0062206281|1.0|I read ALL of Carlos Zafon's books and I love them all. I could not wait for the \\"The prisoner of heaven\\" to come out.  However, this book is complete waste of time. There is no suspension and all this book does is preparing you for the future, probably highly anticipated by readers, installment in a series. For those of you who have not read A.Dumas, this story might be interesting but since I read \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\", I could not forgive the author for using the same trick in his book.

B005938780|5.0|As a 12 year old in 1986, my friend brought over the Somewhere In Time cassette tape. At that time I never heard anything from Iron Maiden, or any metal for that matter growing up in a household that did not allow it.  As I gazed at that album cover for the first time I was instantly a Maiden fan. It's a day I'll never forget.  The music and lyrics of Somewhere In Time equally matched the depth and complexity of the cover art which originally drew me in.<br /><br />From there I discovered The Number of the Beast.  Probably the best metal album of all time.  Powerslave and Piece of Mind were also great albums. That block of 4 albums were my personal favorites for years.  I had a difficult time with Killers and their debut album, not because of the songs but because they lacked Bruce.  After listening to Bruce-based albums for so long it was tough to like anything without him.  Although I'd take Di'Anno over Bayley any day!<br /><br />Just recently I re-visited Seventh Son which I didn't care for originally nor listened to hardly at all.  It is now my most played Maiden album, it's like a continuation of Somewhere in Time but absolutely perfect!  The Clairvoyant is in my top 3 Maiden songs of all time with The Evil that Men Do not far behind. I'd like to see Maiden bring the sounds of S.I.T. and Seventh Son and make another synthesized enhanced album (a trilogy).<br /><br />Somewhere in Time is one of the great Maiden albums that is a Must-Have for any fan.

B00280LYIC|5.0|Percy Jackson always gets into trouble. He thought it was his ADHD and dyslexia that made school hard, but it turns out that Percy is actually a demigod. His mother is mortal and his father is one of the Big Three- Poseidon. So during a field trip to a museum, when Percy's teacher attacks him in monster form, he discovers that he has a lot to learn about himself.<br />Percy is taken to Camp Half-Blood, where all the other demigods (aka heroes) go to train. He discovers his best friend Grover is a satyr and his Latin teacher is actually a centaur and he meets a beautiful warrior, Annabeth, who just happen to be a daughter of Athena. With his world already turned upside down, Zeus accuses Percy of stealing his lightning rod on behalf of his dad. To prevent a war, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover set out on a quest to find the stolen lightning rod. Along their quest they meet other gods, mythical creatures, and have some exciting and dangerous adventures.<br />Rick Riordan weaves an thrilling story, combining Greek mythos and the modern world. Imagine the gate to Hades lies in Los Angeles and Mount Olympus above the Empire State Building. Even without a background in mythology, Riordan brings the gods to life and provides a great storyline packed with adventure and excitement.

B00127RAJY|4.0|No matter what Jillian Michaels DVDs rock!  She's super inspiring and she has completely changed my body in my own home!  So if you want to work out hard and efficiently....I highly recommend these DVDs.  I was a bit disappointed with this DVD - only becaue I had purchased her \\"Ripped in 30\\" DVD first.  I found the \\"Ripped in 30\\" to be a bit more relevant and up-to-date with her techniques/moves and each of the 4 workouts were equally hard.  The 30 Day Shred is definitely a progression of workouts from level 1-3 and uses old school workout techniques.  For my fitness level, level 1 & 2 were much too easy for me. But for someone who is starting out....this DVD would be fantastic.  I will continue to do the level 3 workout from this DVD during my rotation of workouts.
0446585025|4.0|I love Ellen! Her stand up cracks me up and I watch her show on occasion and it always seems to make me laugh. I was expecting this book to really kill me and I also thought I'd learn alot about Ellen's life too. Unfortunelty, I found the book a bit dis-jointed. There were some funny parts, thats for sure, but I was disappointed in the flow of the book and how she didn't really get personal in it. Maybe that was the point of the book I don't know, but I just couldn't really get into because of that. Maybe I was just expecting something different so that's why I was disappointed, I don't know. I still love Ellen! The book was good, don't get me wrong. I'm happy I read it and I would recommend it to real Ellen fans. If you are looking for a drop dead hilarious book, this might not be the one for you.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|i am disappointed in the lack of visual settings on this game.  I do like the challenge and the variety of boards but would like to see more options for tiles, background, and music.  For a free game it is okay.
0316056871|2.0|I'm not a huge Tina Fey fan but that being said I just haven't watched too much of her on TV so I don't know her well in that sense. I heard this book was great though and after reading Rachel Dratch's book (which I LOVED and highly recommend!) I thought I would most likely love this one as well. Not so much, I don't know why I just couldn't really get into it or believe her for some reason. Maybe I just don't know Tina Fey well enough to understand her brand of humor. I guess I would have to say if your a real Tina Fey fan that you'll probably love it but if not this book may not be right for you. Really wish I could have gotten into to it but I just couldn't force my way through it.
0765365278|5.0|I started listening to this book, my wife said \\"this book is HUGE\\" I also was worried it would drag on forever, well the next thing you know, you and your wife are glued to the dvd player,  and your kids are running the place. Great book,  can't wait for the next one
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was such an exciting read. It had all the elements of a book that could hold my attention. It had mystery, lots of believable, well written action with chase scenes, romantic travel, family interaction and plenty of new words for me to consider in my everyday. The only thing I didn't like was that the book ended. Days later I found myself wondering what the Greys were doing. I loved, loved & loved the trilogy. There needs to be a continuem. E L James, you rock! Nice job for a first timer.
B006GHC392|4.0|Making Movies is my favorite Dire Straits record, so I was REALLY hoping to be blown away here. For $70 you're starting out fighting the stigma of \\"was it worth THAT MUCH?\\"  I'm going to give a qualified yes. I don't think the source material was as well recorded as some of the other DS records (or maybe preserved), but it is a HUGE jump in quality and clarity over the CD. It is not as wide a soundscape as I'd hoped, and it's not as warm on the edges-certainly not digital sounding but not James Taylor either. I do have an above average system with a tuned listening room, so I'm not listening to this on Best Buy gear.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the fact that I love the record so much makes me more critical of the sound or more forgiving of it. There is nothing here that makes me not have this be the defacto version-I'll never go back to the original CD, and the OGV 180grm German Vinyl versions are $40 and up if you can find them. I would welcome a comparison, but again this is leaps and bounds above original vinyl and other CD's of it I've heard, but this isn't the SACD I'd pull out to demo the format.
0811806405|5.0|This book is very informative, and a definite must for anyone interested building a guitar. There is just about everything you need to know about the subject and their construction techniques I found to be very good and doable by anyone that is kind of handy with tools. Very interesting I highly recommend it.
B003XNTTYY|5.0|The mistborn series is a great read.  I particularly love the idea of the different magic system that is used in this book (i.e. ingestion of metals)  to create and make use of particular powers of the main characters.  It is definitely quite different.  I have also really enjoyed the development of the main characters from the down trodden and criminal to hero's.  Maybe it is an australian trait - we have always loved barracking for the underdog and have always believed that even though a little naughty there is a redeeming feature/character trait in us all.<br /><br />I have read most of Sandersons books and have found that his characters are developed, real and interesting.
B007IFZU5A|5.0|I have followed Paradise Lost from their very beginning, when they moved forward from their Death Metal roots to more and more Gothic-influenced tracks until they eventually reached the height of their sound with albums like Icon and Drakonian Times. I cannot emphasize enough how much I loved those CDs. From there on, the band decided to turn into a completely different direction - One Second still being a great CD, on which Paradise Lost had not yet completely turned away from their original style - but from 1999 on, I could not identify with their increasingly pop-like sound anymore and lost track of their development for many years. Only in 2007 did I purchased an album again, In Requiem, which although not being the musically most interesting CD of the band, again featured harder songs, apparently an attempt to slowly return to their original roots. \\"Faith Divides Us - Death Unites Us\\", then, consequently followed that path, and Paradise Lost were once more a metal band. Also the quality of the songwriting notably approached what I was used to from the good old times.<br /><br />However, I would have never bet that Paradise Lost would ever again release a CD that I would love as much as Draconian Times or Icon nor did I ever expect that they would really fully return one day to the musical style on these albums that made this band unique and famous in the nineties. And then they came out with Tragic Idol. I think I had tears of joy and pleasure in my eyes when I listened to it for the first time. This is the CD that I would have liked to come after Drakonian Times. It is not only the same style. It is the same high degree of quality, not only on an individual track here and there, but throughout the entire album. If you love the old material of Paradise Lost, this is a MUST BUY!<br /><br />The only question now is where Paradise Lost is going to go from here. If they want to close the circle of development completely, we will receive a Death Metal album in 2-3 years. Lets see. I am definitely excited!

B0080BFVPU|3.0|This is film is the perfect blend of action and romantic comedy.  Great acting all around.  Fun music.  Good love story if not a bit far fetched.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is top notch.  Colors are crisp.  There's only a few artificats that I noticed but for a 1997 film it looks really stunning.  The image is sharp and the blacks look great, which is a priority for this film because Cusack is in black for the entire film.<br /><br />Audio is perfect also.  Voices are centered proper and music and action sound great.<br /><br />Where this disc fails is in the extras.<br /><br />There are none<br /><br />At all<br /><br />Bummer.<br /><br />So this gets 3 out of 5 stars.  It's not quite as epic fail for Disney as Color of Money because this film truly looks remastered.  But it was just such a looooong wait for it come out, wtf is this disc so slack on extras?  Come ON Disney.  Tell me you didn't throw out ALL of your archival footage, interviews, dailys, ANYTHING?  We don't even get a 15 min marketing featurette.  No galleries.  No retrospective interviews.. how fun would it be to hear Alan Arken or Jeremy Piven talk about their roles?  Hell a full cast commentary would have been perfect.<br /><br />It's almost like Disney doesn't care about their studio catalogue titles.  Just the animation or pixar stuff.. or Tron.<br /><br />The Mouse House needs to stop calling these \\"anniversery editions\\" if they aren't going to give us the goods.<br /><br />End rant.

B004SRNH10|1.0|Somehow the Adobe Air 3 app is in the appstore, but it is unattainable. For some reason this has never been updated and when you try to update the app in the Appstore, you are told it can't be done. Amazon/Adobe need to update this because it makes some of the apps on the Fire unusable.
034580404X|3.0|I read through the entire series, because it is a \\"cultural phenomenon\\", and I wanted to know how the story turned out.  It took much too long to tell the tale.  I agree with other reviewers that some of the kinky behavior was necessary to give insight into Christian's character and behavior, but it was distracting after a while.  I liked the faster pace of the third novel and the fact that the author finally got down to the meat of the story.  I felt that the conclusion, however, was hurried and that there were a few loose ends that left me puzzled.
B001GLUQIS|5.0|The writing for this show is incredibly intelligent, which is a lot more than most television shows (and most movies) can boast.  All actors are phenomenal and a lot of thought goes into each moment in each episode.  The plots are tight and the connections made in each one are interesting and unique, sometimes surprising.  You will see some new sci-fi elements here unexplored on tv or films so far, so congrats to the production for originality and execution.  The special effects are great and the tech is believable enough.  Great ensemble and stellar lead actors.  If you enjoyed Abrams' creation of \\"Alias\\", you will enjoy this as it's a similar idea, but with a scifi twist.  It's Alias meets X-files.  Very well-directed with a high production value and extreme attention to detail.  This series has a higher production value and better scripts than most movies of the same genres.  I would highly recommend this!  I was hooked in less than 5 minutes!  The pilot alone is a knockout.<br /><br />Don't go by the unfortunate reviewers who complain about the streaming. It's a shame that they chose to rate Amazon's streaming rather than the show itself. The show is stellar. As a fellow streamer, it's working fine for me: no hiccups or glitches so far.  They appear to have fixed this issue, but regardless, we shouldn't take away from the quality of the product because of the provider's service.  The people who created this show worked really hard to deliver the goods and it's unfair to them to take away points for things out of their control.  It would be like giving a movie a bad review because the theater projector was faulty.
630587493X|3.0|Bicentennial Man was one of the most lasckluster robot tales Isaac Azimov ever wrote and it's no wonder it ended up as another unimaginative Hollywood BLAH; nothing on par with his overall robot series. The movie starts nice and has some few great moments, as when the robot starts his pilgrimage to find others of his kind (and in Frisco he meets that smart-mouther female version; I laughed out loud at the way she danced... the last pleasant surprise the film had in store for me). After that, it just spirales downward and the movie becomes a general letdown.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|app has many different sound bytes. can create any combination to relax. strongly recommended for insomniacs like myself. cheers folks.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|please don't waste any of your time on money on this book series.  It honestly isn't worth it.  Luckily I read these books for free, mostly to see what the fuss was about it.  I've never been so disappointed in anything I've read.  Most disappointing, however, is the popularity and acclaim these books have achieved.  Are our relationships so terrible that THIS is what we, as women, hope to achieve in our own lives? An emotionally, physically, and mentally abusive relationship that a naive and inexperience women can't seem to escape from? Even worse is Ana's justification for going back to him: Christian is just so HANDSOME.  Seriously? Call me the minority, but attractiveness isn't the only quality I look for in a man.  The message that a man can be CHANGED is a terrible one to spread to the world.  Yes, men sometimes do see the errors of their ways, but you should be with someone that you love for WHO THEY ARE, not what you hope they will stop being and can maybe ignore or start liking yourself. It saddens me that teenage girls reading this will grow up thinking that this is an appropriate relationship for them to desire.  I won't even get started on the writing itself... that, unfortunately, cannot be helped.  I can set aside my own ideals for a book that I find enjoyable, but this book made me want to throw up. We (women) are better than this.  At least I thought so.  However, one positive thing came from reading this book: it made me appreciate my caring, sweet, emotionally available, NON-ABUSIVE boyfriend so, so, so much more than I already did. So thank you, E.L. James, for that.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a fun hake good to pass time and also I need 20 characters so uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... yeah so hows it goon person who's reading this
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I find it hilarious how much better the reviews are for this book solely because most people with brains stopped reading after the first one. I kept reading because it was free, and because I could read it on a PDF at my work computer.  I got paid to read this series, and I still regret it.  Just terrible.  At least the plot gets a bit more interesting, but still, awful.  Sex scenes are boring and repetitive, writing is awful. He's still abusive, she's still naive, and it's still an horrible message to promote to girls everywhere.  As long as he's handsome, it's okay if he treats you like crap!
B00884GR0W|3.0|I got this app about 3 weeks ago and ive already mined all the gems and ores built the car and killed a dragon its a fun game but needs lots of work Im really into sandbox games and especially minecraft. this game is fun but it needs more tools torches etc and blocks like furnaces and condensers also chests should not share inventory
B007IXWL2C|1.0|again, not many bad reviews because only people who liked the first two kept reading! regardless, truly a terrible book.  I just write this to hopefully bring the ratings down so that people don't waste their time.  sex is still boring (I actually just started skipping whole sex scenes to get through the book faster). But don't worry ladies! A man CAN change! he's not damaged emotionally anymore, because now they have babies! everyone go out and find the most abusive man you can find.  he'll make a GREAT husband.
B008220AVW|5.0|Okay, I'm a huge Katy Perry fan. I think her songs are pretty amazing, and she has the image of what a popstar should be, not really crazy like Gaga or Minaj, just a singer without the craziness. I also went to her concert last year, but thanks to this film, most of the fans get to know the real Katy Perry. Not the one we know from the music, or the one we see on interviews.<br />Following her life on the California Dreams Tour 2011, in this film we get to know Katy's origins, her life while touring and the struggles she has. Perry shows not only the great side of being famous, but also the bad one that includes pressure, fatigue and the obligation she has to put a smile every night in a concert even if she's broken on the inside. This film is only for fans and for non-judgemental people, honestly if you are not a KatyCat, you won't enjoy this movie. It's made for fans.<br />I think the 3D wasn't really needed. The movie only has like three or four 3D effects, but it was also a great addition to make the film more appealing to fans. If you haven't seen it yet, go and give it a try. If you're a KatyCat like me, you'll love her even more and if you don't, you'll probably become a fan after watching this.

034580404X|5.0|I have never read books so fast as I read the 50 Shades Trilogy. I also was never more disappointed when I finished reading. I was really sad that there wasn't more! I definitely want to read them again. It's just a great story aside from all the kinky parts of the books. It has everything! Romance, sex, mystery, suspense. I definitely recommend these books!

B0036S4C6G|4.0|Sometimes books are difficult to describe, whether because of their structure, content or narrative style. As I read Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad, I realized more and more that it was a difficult book to really pin down, as it kept defying my expectations. More a collection of linked stories than a novel and less about the music business than other reviews led me to believe, this book had tremendous heart and soul, and a number of the characters have kept me thinking about them even after finishing the book.<br /><br />The two anchors of the book are music executive Bennie Salazar and his troubled assistant, Sasha, although many of the stories focus on different people with significant or tangential connections to one or both of them. The stories take place at different times and in different locations around the world, so at times you are able to see what happened to a particular character or how they got to where they were in an earlier story. While the jumbled sense of time and characters can be a bit confusing at first, the stories draw you in fairly quickly and I found it easy to get oriented to when and where each was taking place. Oh, and did I mention that one chapter--one of my favorites--is actually a PowerPoint presentation? (It's not as weird as it sounds. The one challenge was viewing it on a Kindle.)<br /><br />I really enjoyed all but the last chapter in this book. It took place in the future (although you're not certain how far into the future) and Egan uses strange lingo and creates a setting that is hard to get your head around. But other than that, I thought this book was really well-written and some of the stories packed quite a wallop. It may be a little work to remember each character and determine where and when the chapters take place, but it's well worth the effort.

B003V1WUKS|2.0|People in the public eye are always looking for the next big thing. Singers want to act, actors want to direct or sing, and they all want to write a novel. Add James Franco to that literary list. Franco, who has acted in movies and on General Hospital, made a short film and went back to school to get his master's degree, recently published Palo Alto, a collection of 11 linked short stories about teenagers growing up in (where else?) Palo Alto. I'm a big James Franco fan, but most of the stories in this collection make me think he should stick to acting.<br /><br />The collection started out with a few promising stories. In \\"Lockheed,\\" a very intelligent young girl is stuck in a boring summer internship and then she witnesses a disturbing act of violence at a party she shouldn't even have attended. \\"American History\\" tells the story of a student who feigns racism in a class assignment to impress a girl, only to have it backfire. But beyond that, every story is about rootless, self-absorbed and self-destructive teenagers who resort to drugs, violence, sex and, in one story, sexual abuse, to pass the time. I know that Franco was probably trying to make a statement about these kids needing direction, needing something concrete and worthwhile to fill their days, but I honestly felt very little empathy for most of the characters. Instead of exploring why a narrator of one of the stories would want to crash his car into an abutment, Franco sensationalizes it and turns it into a joke afterward.<br /><br />I believe Franco's writing shows promise, but honestly, I think that this collection got published mainly because he is James Franco. I'm not a squeamish person, but the excess of drugs, violence, abusive language, animal cruelty, sex and reprehensible behavior became tremendously unappealing very quickly.
0316098337|4.0|I enjoyed this novel very much.  I found pondering the logistics of raising a child alone in a sequestered state for five years fascinating.  The mental implications of the circumstances of Ma and Jack's experiences interested me.  I will be honest, in the beginning of the book, I did not enjoy reading through Jack's sentence structures and how he personified every object.  However, as I learned more about the character and why he personified his surroundings, I got used to the child narrator.  I would have preferred a little less clumsy use of language as I found myself having to reread sentences throughout the book to grasp what Jack was exactly trying to say. More so than that minor annoyance, was the author's overuse of the word \\"bit\\".  It was used almost every other page.  I know now that the author is not American so that does make more sense, however, it still bugged me very much.  American's do not use the word \\"bit\\" incessantly.  I mentioned those two aspects of the book so that I could explain why I rated this book a four instead of a five.  I found the story intriguing all the way through and, though Jack's language use was clumsy, I enjoyed him as a narrator.  Seeing the events through the eyes of a child was brilliant and offered so much more than most novels would.  I loved this unique book and I recommend it highly.
B0026SCMNM|4.0|Some novels, regardless of their length, are big, with their weighty issues, larger-than-life characters and major plot twists. Other books are smaller, and although they may not be characterized by a great deal of drama or action, they still have some weight to them. Colm Toibin's Brooklyn definitely falls in the latter category.<br /><br />It is the early 1950s in Ireland, and Eilis Lacey spends her life blending into her surroundings. Her older sister has a job in Dublin, her brothers have moved to England and even her friends are heading toward marriage. After Eilis finds a job where she is treated like a servant, her sister and an Irish priest in America arrange for her to move to Brooklyn, where she will live in a rooming house with other Irish girls and work in a store until she can find an office job. She experiences some homesickness and struggles with the same feelings of inadequacy until she meets Tony, an Italian plumber who is clearly devoted to her, and starts to introduce her to life in America (complete with Coney Island and a Brooklyn Dodgers game). And as they begin planning for their future, she receives disturbing news from Ireland, which sets a number of events into motion.<br /><br />Toibin is a great writer, and I always marvel at his ability to infuse \\"everyday\\" situations with a kind of poetry. I felt the buildup to Eilis' move to America took too long, although it did lay a foundation for what occurred later in the story, but once Eilis settled into her life and became a bit more animated, I felt the book hit its stride. I liked many of the characters, and disliked the ones you clearly were supposed to, and found the way Toibin unfurled the story was really compelling, even if it did so with more of a whisper than a scream. All in all, I enjoyed this book, even if it lacked the \\"punch\\" I was hoping for. (I'd also recommend several of Toibin's earlier books, including The Blackwater Lightship, The Story of the Night and The Master.)
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I purchased the Spiderman game to keep my grandson entertained.  He was so excited because it is interactive that we are planning to purchase one for his birthday. The cost is just slightly higher than a DS however, the game costs are significantly lower - you get your value with one or two games and books as well.  The Kindle is a plus for grandparents while grandchildren visit and we can use the kindle the rest of the time.  I downloaded songs from my computer and can access my e-mail when I travel.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I'm often torn between rushing through all of the books in a series and savoring them, so I'm not left pining for more. While I read the first book in Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy after it came out, I read the last two in the last three months, so impatience won out.<br /><br />When The Girl Who Played with Fire ended, Lisbeth Salander had been seriously wounded in an attack and left for dead, while the public (and many in the Swedish police) believed she was guilty of three brutal murders. As she recovers from her injuries, she must fight for her life in many ways, as a political conspiracy grows ever more powerful in its desire to ensure she never has the chance to see the light of freedom again. As always, she is assisted by her friend, reporter Mikael Blomkvist, whose dogged determination to prove Salander's innocence threatens him and those he loves with significant harm. The ramifications that occur from Blomkvist and Salander's discoveries have the potential to shake the entire country.<br /><br />I felt that The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was a worthy conclusion to Larsson's trilogy, as it tied up many loose ends and advanced the lives of its characters in a logical, not necessarily convenient, fashion. While this novel didn't have as much raw action as the last two books, the courtroom drama of Salander's trial was pretty intense. I'll admit the concluding confrontation irked me a bit, as I felt it was almost tacked on for effect, but beyond that I can say this entire trilogy was tremendously thought-provoking and exciting.
B001HN6922|3.0|Don't know how this happened since it is brand new out of packaging but it is happening<br />Tried cleaning with anti static wipes.<br />Helped a little.  Might just buy in a brick and mortar store next time.  Kids disappointed
0060936223|5.0|Wow. What a fantastically written and compelling book.<br /><br />True confession time: I honestly didn't know much about Patti Smith, save her song \\"Because the Night,\\" and I didn't know much about the artist Robert Mapplethorpe, except for the controversy much of his work generated. I also had no idea that Smith and Mapplethorpe had a more than 20-year friendship that inspired both of their artistic careers to flourish. But I had heard wonderful things about Smith's memoir, Just Kids (it recently won the National Book Award), so I thought I'd give the book a shot and perhaps learn something new as well.<br /><br />Smith is a tremendously gifted writer. As she unfolds the story of her friendship with Mapplethorpe and her struggle to find herself and realize her place in the artistic community, her narrative has an almost poetic quality. This was a relationship that flourished in the early 1970s, a very creative, wild time, and Smith truly evoked imagery of that era, empathy as both she and Mapplethorpe struggled to find their artistic footing (while finding the money to survive), and both beauty and anguish in her description of their relationship. This is an inspirational and heartbreaking story about a way of life that really no longer exists, and the story provides insight into two true icons. Don't be put off if you don't know much about either Smith or Mapplethorpe--you'll find yourself drawn to the narrative that Smith has woven.

0061692042|5.0|What do you say about a Pulitzer-prize-winning author whose 400-page book you read in 2 days? -- It's obvious why he's Pulitzer material.<br /><br />He's written a great coming-of-age story, but what's striking about it is how elegant he makes the ordinariness of his story and characters. And you gotta love those first two lines. They're destined to become a classic. He uses foreshadowing throughout the book in a way that makes you keep reading just to get to the part he's hinted at.<br /><br />And this was a free Kindle ebook. What a deal!
B003MC5AV2|5.0|This book kept me up all night, I was so excited to see how Penny's adventures would end. This book should be recomended for all girls who have gone through boy drama and ended up losing their friends, their identity and their happiness.  It even will have  readers wanting to listen to the Beatles. Where was this book when I was in highschool? :)

B005EGXTL2|2.0|I thought 1 and 2 were very good.  However this one is not so.  Several issues.  First Katnis' personality.  She has become a bit of a teenage Diva.  She demands utter loyalty from everyone but gives little.  If she suspects you of<br />1. not telling her everything she want to know immediately<br />2. of not having approved (by her) thoughts or<br />3. not agreeing with her in every way<br />she cuts you off with a childish temper tantrum and you are not allowed to offer any defence.  (Although the best defence would be \\"Well get over it who made you the tyrant Queen of everything.) .You then have to come crawling back at least twice and a sufficient period of time out must elapse before you are reluctantly her friend again.  (although now demoted down the friend list).  You also have to show continual contrition and be grateful of your reinstatement and in awe of her mercy.<br />I couldn't finish it.  I started to hope Katnis would get killed off and we could have some of the other characters do something other than fawn at her.<br />In one scene she and another minion shoot down a couple of enemy bomber aircraft with.....bows and explosive arrows???????????<br />Got a third through it and couldnt swallow any more teenage schoolgirl you are not my friend anymore tantrums.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|How I wanted to like this<br /><br />It was full of promise when Ridley Scott decided to do a prequel to Alien. For me there are 2 Alien movies, Alien and Aliens. The others I don't bother with and of the first two I really like the directors commentary on the first.<br /><br />So when Scott announced he would be making this I was delighted. Then came promising trailers and viral trailers like Guy Pearce in the Peter Wayland TED viral or Fassbender in the David 8 trailer are terrific (both can be found on youtube). So it looked very good.<br /><br />It isn't very good. It isn't even good. It is a mess.<br /><br />The film starts o.k. but very quickly goes past the point of reasonable disbelief. Lets enter orbit of a planet in the hope of finding a landing place (rather than find one from orbit) and this group of scientist act about as rationally as a group of highschool kids if you set them on a space voyage for spring break. Regularily something new is thrown in to keep tension in the film without ever resolving what had happened previously. And this goes on and on until it is a mess. Even the characters became one dimensional wrecks. Although an abdominal cesarean of a large alien didn't prevent them from running around with a few staples. Well admittedly Noomi Rapace does cry after the operation but then again she cries a lot - so much for Scott's strong female lead.<br /><br />Of course if you set out with the promise of finding \\"the answer to life the universe and everything\\" - you will fail to deliver since Ridley simply can't.<br /><br />By the end I was more excited to see the movie finish rather than wait for another new twist and I was hugely disappointed. they had the budget, they had the actors and they had Scott so whiskey tango foxtrot went wrong?<br /><br />I had to look it up on IMdB and there it was crystal clear. Damon Lindelof is what is wrong. If you don't know who he is then he wrote Lost, a series that lived up to its title. And it all falls into place. Prometheus is no more a prequel to Alien than it is 42 episodes of Lost squeezed into a feature film. Constantly being bombarded with new events without resovling a thing = LOST. Characters behaving unbelievably unrationally and ever more so = LOST.<br /><br />So this prequel falls into place with Aliens3 and Alien: Resurrection and is in fact probaly worse than those two bad as they were.

B001UV4XJ2|3.0|I can't even describe in words how much I was looking forward to this movie. Deathly Hallows is my favorite Harry Potter book, and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is my favorite Harry Potter movie. All of the trailers and featurettes and early reviews made the movie sound absolutely amazing. I try usually not to let hype get my expectations up too much, but in this case I couldn't help it. I was fully expecting the series to go out with a bang<br /><br />Were my high expectations met? Sadly...no. It was a big let-down, actually. It didn't feel like part of DH 1. It was more similar in tone to the Half-Blood Prince movie to me for some reason. It was too short and just felt chopped up. Like HBP, it seemed like a lot more was filmed, but then it was hacked in the editing room. And then I read that this was exactly the case...All of the actors, practically, from the previous films are back- for mostly blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos. The battle was lackluster and anticlimactic. At points it felt rushed, at other points too slow. A lot of the dialogue was changed and didn't feel right. The relationships were handled awkwardly. This is just my purist side, but a lot was changed from the book. I didn't think it would be that way, after Part 1. It really let me down.<br /><br />Was it a terrible movie? By no means. The acting was good, the special effects were great (though I wouldn't pay the extra money for the 3D), and some of the scenes did hit the mark.  I know I bashed it pretty hard up there, but, really, the majority of my complaints are based only on the changes from the book. I'm judging it not really for the movie it was but for the movie it could have been, the movie I wanted it to be. The hype definitely ruined things for me. I feel like I would have liked it better if I hadn't read the books. But then again, my brother, who has only seen the movies, was also let down. He was disappointed by the lack of a bit epic battle scene that he was expecting there to be. So maybe that's also an unfair assumption on my part.e that's also an unfair assumption on my part.

0547258305|2.0|Graceling is the story of Katsa, a girl \\"graced\\" with the power to kill.  I was expecting an action-packed adventure with the bonus of romance. I think my expectations were part of what made the book so disappointing for me.<br /><br />It started out promising and sucked me in. I liked the cast of characters (well, Po was perhaps a little too perfect) and just the whole idea in general. I really wanted to love this book, but in the end, I just couldn't.<br /><br />I think Cashore had a great idea and the bare bones of the plot line were good. It fell apart, however, in the execution. For one thing, it's poorly written. The prose/sentence structures are clumsy and filled with repetition of the same words and phrases. The awkwardness kept taking me out of the story while reading, even in the interesting parts. Where were the editors for this book, I just wanna know?<br /><br />Then we come to the plot itself. Like I said, it started out good- in an action-filled scene. Then it quickly went down-hill. After an introduction to the world and characters, it moved to a long, draggy middle of the protagonists traveling, building up to a villain we barely even see and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it anticlimax. I was just disappointed all around.<br /><br />I think this book could have been great if Kristin Cashore maybe had taken more care to flesh out her ideas- and gotten a better editor. Seriously, whoever did this book was clearly asleep on the job.
0763630497|5.0|This is a wonderful book for anyone who likes birding and poetry! It features twenty common North American birds, with a haiku and beautiful artwork for each bird. It also has some helpful information about each bird at the end. Highly recommended!
0375842209|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It is a masterpiece. It depicts the circumstances of the local people in the towns not far from a concentration camp. The main characters are richly drawn, with their endurance, bravery and faults. The story is narrated by Death. I'm not usually bothered with imagery, but I loved how Death describes the sky as echoing the emotions of the characters.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community is an amazing show staring amazing actors and backed by an amazing score.  Today Community has lost some of it's brilliance (it's still great though), but the first season is one of best seasons I've seen of any show ever.  Every episode is filled with witty jokes, pop culture references, and character interactions that lead into huge growth and pay offs.  Now I know that this sounds a little like other sitcoms on tv but Community does it so much better, so much smarter, more organically.  On top of the great episodes the DVD comes with countless bonus features.  Commentaries on all 25 episodes (which is al ot of episodes for a show to have, by the way), highlight reels, outtakes, mini-episodes and more.  Right now the season one DVD is 16 dollars which is 100% worth every cent.

B007MDB71O|1.0|After reading some of the great reviews here on Amazon, and especially those from people like me, i.e. 50+ years old, I ordered the Blu-Ray, and could hardly wait to sit down and relive my childhood dreams!<br /><br />I remember going out at night, staring up at the dark night sky; holding my arms outstretched towards Mars (maybe) and wishing with all my might to be taken to Barsoom; where I could help Mr. Carter keep things going right for that dying world, with maybe some adventures for me?  And a beautiful girl too?  It never worked of course; I knew that Mars was a dead planet, but couldn't help imagining that if I could wish hard enough I would travel through space and time to a Mars inhabited by giant green men, noble red martians, and beautiful women in peril.<br /><br />Of course back then I also wanted my own spacesuit so I could get picked up by a passing spaceship for some adventures in Mr. Heinlein's universe!<br /><br />So, after watching the movie for the first time, I swear I could feel dear Edgar Rice Burroughs (ERB) rolling over in his grave!  I watched it again just to make sure that it was as bad as all that, and to my non-amazement, I was almost brought to tears with yet another horrible \\"Hollywood\\" adaption of a book!<br /><br />First:  Mr. Carter was a \\"Gentleman\\", which we all know means that he had no skills at all, right?  He acted like a criminal and a buffoon!  Couldn't use a sword well?  The greatest swordsman on Earth? (and later Barsoom) No \\"gentleman\\" would ever act that way!  Plus, we all know that John was a mystery even to himself.  No family to speak of, and that he could remember no childhood and had always been about 30 and always been a warrior.  That the Civil War was only one of may wars in which he had fought.  My father always told me that officers were gentlemen by act of Congress, but I was/would be one by my actions.<br /><br />Second: Against my wishes I have to admit that they did a great job making me feel like I was really in a ERB book.  The Tharks were perfect!  Right out of my own imagination (and the covers of all my very old Mars series copies).  And when John looked into the incubator, I knew exactly what he was going to see!  Squirmy baby tharks!  The Thoats looked pretty good and I fell in love with Woola! He maybe could have been a little more ferocious, but he was A-OK in my book!  Was the city of Thark really that rundown/ruined?  Maybe it was, but I thought it was much bigger; big enough for thousands of green martians to live there.<br /><br />Third: John is so strong he can jump HUNDREDS of feet into the air?  Right!  Even the book had a few out-of-this-world jumps, but never as many as in the movie.  So much for destroying any suspension of disbelief.  Back to your cartoons Mr Stanton!  And joking that he should be protected by the woman?  Again, Gentleman, people!<br /><br />Forth, fifth.... tenth:  The story is just a mess!  If you don't believe me, please, please read the books!  Holy Therns travelling back and forth to Earth?  What?  Must have been in a different book, since the one(s) I read said no Martian had ever been to Earth (Jasoom).  Not bothering to introduce the many different Martian species (Whites, Reds, Greens, Blacks), and the reason for much of the fighting.  And what was that trip through Lake Powel?  I dunno, either!  Sab Than and his marriage to Dejah is in there but turned into a cartoon with the Therns showing up again.  Zodanga!  Evil!  Bad guys! Cartoon!  What about Warhoon?  Kantos Kan? Tal Hajus? The ATMOSPHERE FACTORY!  Nope.  Too complicated.  Keep it cartoonish!<br /><br />TIME: Again, movies that can't tell time!  There was a 20 year period between the initial trip to Mars by John Carter, and his subsequent trip after his \\"Death\\" with the special instructions for his Mausoleum.  10 more years before Edgar opens the manuscript and more time to prepare it for printing.<br /><br />Ok, I'm almost done.  This movie reminds me of something said by an author I admire about a movie makeover of one of his books:  That is had a lot of his dialogue and none of his story.  Ok, I'll tell: John Steakley!  Oh, I'd love to do \\"Armor\\" for you Mr. Steakley!<br /><br />And I'm sorry, but the book/story/tale is the Author's and not the Director's/Producer's!  Please tell the Author's story to the best of your ability, and stop trying to make things yours unless you are the writer.<br /><br />PLEASE, PLEASE give me $200 million and I'll make a movie that has no Hollywood in it.  I mean, after all, there have been millions of books written and one of them has to be better that the second remake of \\"Total Recall\\" or any other bad remake these days!<br /><br />How about \\"Hammer's Slammers\\"?  A decent version of \\"Starship Troopers\\"? \\"Have Space suit, will Travel\\"?<br /><br />Well, it's dark and time for me to find Mars!<br /><br />Ciao

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved books one and two of the trilogy.However the third book I think it had a lot of repetitive chapters.  No doubt that this is a book that you will love, if you are a romantic. The story of the main characters was very original, not more of the same boy meets girl and fall in love,  it's more like Girl meets handsome bad boy and gets introduce in to his world that she did not know anything of. Is she willing to accept it?  or is he willing to change for her?
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This is a movie that I rented while on vacation in Europe. I mainly rented it to watch while in flight.However, I discovered that in order to watch a rental. you must download it to your Kindle, or have access to wi-fi. While inflight, I discovered that the air line company was charging $15.00 for wi-fi.I felt that that was too expensive. As a result, I waited until I returned home to watch the video.<br /><br />After watching it, I am glad that I did not pay for the wi-fi. I personally did not care for the movie. There was not a sufficient explanation as to the plot, and the ending left you \\"hanging\\".
0670022411|4.0|The story starts off very strong, and starts to dwindle a bit.  I must agree with some of the reviews, Diana starts out strong and then starts to lose her strength of character, then she is endowed with a ton of magical powers.  I am giving the book a 4 star review because it is a good read, am hoping the next book is stronger.
030758836X|5.0|I don't often read outside of my comfort zone. I love science fiction and I love fantasy and not much else holds my interest. Every once and a while though I'll take a risk and venture outside my safety bubble. GONE GIRL by Gillian Flynn was recommended to me with infectious enthusiasm. It wasn't my usual cup of tea but the premise was perplexing and so I decided to give it a shot. WOW, I am so glad I did not let this one pass me by.<br /><br />On the morning of Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary she goes missing. As the investigation gets rolling evidence leads the police and the public to suspect the obvious: it's always the husband. There is more to the story than Nick Dunne will let on but does that necessarily mean he is to blame for the disappearance of his wife?<br /><br />It's always the husband. Right? Maybe not...GONE GIRL is the best sort of book. This is the sort of novel that will challenge your preconceived notions. This is the sort of novel that will absorb you fully and not let you go until you flip the final page. Even then you are bound to continue mulling it over in your head. This is the sort of book that dominates your conscious, whether you're at work or school or whatever it is you people do. I don't take time to reflect on books as I read them. I just don't have the luxury. With GONE GIRL I was pausing every fifty pages or so to contemplate what it was that I had read. And even then I finished it in a few sittings. I got this book on a Tuesday and had finished it by Thursday night. At 400 pages and given the concerns of daily life that is no small feat.<br /><br />So what makes GONE GIRL such an addictive book? For starters it is incredibly well written. From start to finish, GONE GIRL is a nearly flawless psychological thriller. The book is told from two perspectives, Nick and Amy's. Nick's POV picks up the day Amy goes missing and continues on with the investigation. Amy's POV is past-tense, told in the form of diary entries leading up to the disappearance. For the entirety of the novel Nick maintains his innocence, but he also confesses to a number of indiscretions. The entries from Amy's diary paint a very different picture of Nick, as well as a very different picture of Amy. Readers will experience the two falling in and out of love, the highs and lows of the marriage, from two perspectives that don't quite match up.<br /><br />The characters of Nick and Amy are real people. At least that's how it feels. Flynn crafts remarkably authentic characters and utterly believable relationships. I developed genuine feelings for both leads, feelings that morphed and grew over the course of the novel. It's impossible not to care about these people. That doesn't mean they are necessarily likable. I've seen some complaints that they aren't \\"likable enough.\\" Well yeah, that's true in a sense, because they are placed under a high intensity microscope. The deeper you look into someone the less you will find to like. But it goes both ways. The deeper you look into someone the more you can find to admire. I had anxiety over finishing the novel because I cared that much about these characters.<br /><br />The ancillary characters are also well drawn. It takes no effort at all to picture these people and their motivations and their relationships. There is no shortage of suspects, even though all of the evidence seems to be pointing in one direction. It is enough to make you wonder how thoroughly the media influences perception. Everyone always assumes the husband is to blame but that's what we have been conditioned to believe.<br /><br />GONE GIRL is a psychological thriller of the highest order. Hitchcock style. The suspense is almost unbearable. Horror movie directors need to take some freaking notes. This is how you do it. GONE GIRL is too involved for a movie but I would love to see it picked up and developed as a television mini-series. Even when I expected one twist I was still floored when my revelation came true. It's just that good. There is some very dark, very twisted stuff here but none of it is beyond the realm of belief. And that's what makes it so creepy. This could happen to you. It could happen to me. I really, really hope this doesn't happen to me. It just goes to show you, sometimes the most disturbing thing of all is not knowing someone half so well as you think.<br /><br />Recommended Age: 17+<br />Language: Plenty.<br />Violence: Uh, wow I guess there really isn't any violence. But it is discussed.<br />Sex: No real sex here either, but there is discussion of sex. \<br /><br />Nick Sharps<br />Elitist Book Reviewsrue. It's just that good.

B007X4ECMI|5.0|Great quips, bickering main characters, a space station overrun with the insane criminals, and a whole bunch of guns. There's even a plotline. I liked that gore didn't take center stage, neither did f-bombs left and right. Lately movies have tried too hard to be real and gritty. This was straight up action and fun. Think the era of Tango and Cash type movies.

B00005V9HA|3.0|\\"Re-Animator\\" is directed by Stuart Gordon. This sci-fi comedy horror film is based on the H.P. Lovecraft story \\"Herbert West-Reanimator\\". H.P. Lovecraft was guided by the philosophical principle that life was incomprehensible to human minds, and that the universe was inimical to the interests of humankind. In \\"Re-Animator\\" this notion is explored as experiments in bringing animals and people back from the dead sets in motion an uncontrollable orgy of madness. Herbert West's experiments are transgressions of societal morality that open the doors of madness upon the medical staff at the Miskatonic University in New England. This film is more comedy than horror with its almost giddy exuberance and over the top handling of grisly reanimations of humans and their body parts. The horror is transcended by this hysterical mania of people creating and then trying to escape from the ever growing chaos of gruesome creations. The obsessions of West, and his nemesis Dr. Carl Hill, to explore the boundaries of the known and transgress moral limits leads to terrible consequences for all, though right to the end of the story the desire by the living to bring back those who have died is represented as the greater need than the incurring folly of the inevitably horrible consequences for the reanimated ones. The world depicted by Stuart Gordon is of an absurd universe where people who are unbounded by moral conscience create chaos for those around them. If you like your horror over the top then this film may be for you.<br /><br />For those that enjoy this film one may want to also check out \\"Evil Dead II\\", and \\"Dead Alive\\".
B0011E7JBW|5.0|We were going to take our kids to MIB III, so we purchased this quickly and easily for them to watch via computer before we left for the theater.  Even though there are a few swears, and a bit of violence, I think it's MUCH better than PG-13's that have come out recently for children.  When an alien is killed it's just goo they see (although there is a scene with a spike in the head).  Enjoy this classic movie.

I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste their money buying this nonesense..on the brighter side its been on my side-table and makes an excellent coaster
0307887448|5.0|Like my title says, \\"I loved it!\\" This is a very original and creative story from an author I have never read before.<br /><br />The story is set in the near future when famine and poverty is rampant. Everyone \\"escapes\\" via an Internet-based simulation game called OASIS. The creator of the OASIS game is rich beyond belief and gives away his fortune (in his will) to the first player who can figure out how to get 3 keys and pass through their respective gates. Since the game's creator was a big fan of the 80's, there are numerious references and clues to this time period. I lived through the 80's and many of the references were unknown to me. So, the author must have done extensive research in this area.<br /><br />The author did a great job of getting me hooked and this book became a real page-turner for me. The only *very* minor complaint I have is that the protagonist had deep knowledge in so many areas of 80's music, movies, games, etc. that seemed unrealistic. But, this shouldn't stop you from picking this up and enjoying it. Bravo! 5 stars.

B005JZBP8W|1.0|For what was one of the most publicized restorations in film history, it is totally inexcusable for CBS to have released this inferior transfer. I got through less than 5 minutes of the Blu Ray disc and simply couldn't take it any longer. The opening credit sequence is grainy and once the film moves into the film proper, there is a weird hazy fog that circles the center part of the frame. This is downright horrible. The discs should be recalled and destroyed. This would be bad for any film, but for what is considered one of the greatest film musicals ever made its downright criminal.

B003XM70B4|5.0|Excellent movie and in spanish language so my kids could see it and understand  it. Took me back when i was like 10 yo. Love how my son and daughter laughed and enyoy it so much and then heard about when i saw it 20 years ago. In less than a week they had already seen it several times , and me too.<br />Great to spend some time with your kids.
B0086700CM|5.0|Or Frogger even?<br /><br />Or any of the chase scenes in the Indiana Jones Movies?<br /><br />Temple Run is all of that and more!<br /><br />Your character runs a nonstop obstacle course through the jungle, jumping over trees and gaps in the path, avoiding sharp turns and bands of fire all while being chased by a pack of wild monkey beasts. You earn points for distance and by collecting coins along the way.<br /><br />You can also pick up other perks that speed up the course, increase your coin points, make you invisible to obstacles, and more. You can also spend your coins to unlock other characters, buy speed passes, resurrection wings, etc.<br /><br />The graphics look great on the Kindle Fire device. After a long day at work, I love to veg on the sofa and play several games of it - trying hard to beat my top scores.  That's also another plus - there are leader boards where you can see how you measure up to other players, and lots of trophies to earn along the way.<br /><br />Best game on my Kindle Fire so far!

B005LAJ23A|5.0|Best show on TV with a close second to Breaking Bad. I am not a zombie person... but this show is more than about zombies... season 2 was a little slower than season 1, however they explained a lot in season 2. Season 3 LOOKS AMAZING! Can't wait!. Haven't seen either season? I suggest you watch these...you will likely be surprised that you like them... they are that good.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Failed journalist Nick comes home to find his beautiful wife Amy missing and all clues pointing to him as her murderer. A good beginning for a fine thriller, except the mystery is short-lived as the reasons for Amy's disappearance are all too quickly revealed. Although there is some tension as the not-too-bright protagonist struggles to outwit his almost impossibly clever adversary, the book  soon begins looking less like  work of fiction than a thinly disguised essay on the differing male and female views of marriage. It ultimately ends on an entirely false note as the protagonist proves far too spineless, and the antagonist far too omniscient, than can readily be believed.

B005LAIGN2|5.0|Cuba Gooding Jr., David Oyelowo, Nate Parker, and Terrence Howard star in this great movie about the famed Tuskegee Airmen.  The Tuskegee Airmen were an all-negro unit.  Thus, they were relegated to second-rate aircraft and flew missions of little importance.  But, due to the efforts of Colonel Bullard (Howard), the Tuskegee Airman soon found themselves at the forefront of the air war over Europe.<br /><br />The Tuskegees were given the opportunity to fly bomber escort.  The caveat was that they were to remain close to the bombers throughout the mission.  Given brand-new P-51 Mustangs, the Tuskegee Airmen soon made a name for themselves with both the grateful bomber crews and the German pilots.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  I originally saw it in the theater and I bought the DVD copy.  The acting is very good, and David Oyelowo (Lightning), Nate Parker (Easy), Terrence Howard (Colonel Bullard), and Cuba Gooding Jr. all give fine performances.  The special effects and air combat scenes are what make this movie so good.  It was thrilling to watch the B-17s, P-51s, and ME-109s fighting it out.  The other action scenes, including the attack on the German train and air base are exciting as well.<br /><br />I give this fine movie my highest recommendation.  Watch \\"Red Tails\\" and see how the famed Tuskegee Airmen helped to defeat the Luftwaffe.

0547569653|4.0|Despite of being a little bit obsessive and radical at some points, and I guess that ultra runners in general and Jurek in particular are pretty much that way, this book is full of inspiring and useful paragraphs to repeat to yourself every morning. It's not that much about running technique but about life style. Jurek point is that healthy life (through diet and almost religious running discipline) can make you not just a better athlete, but also a happier and deeper individual.

B0000524CY|4.0|The Exorcist remains one of those films that scared the hell out of a whole generation back in the 1970s. Although it does not hold the graphic artistry or modern technical abilities of todays horror films, The Exorcist falls into that category of older films that has something todays films have lost, a mixture of quality acting combined with that eras respect for horror. One of the more effective filming techniques is the use of light and color played against the story's actress/mother Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyns) reaction shots; Father Merrin's (Max Von Sydow) powerful presence in facing the demon and victim Regan McNeil's (Linda Blair) playful innocense as the demon child.<br /><br />The film begins with the haunting chant of a middle eastern prayer in Iraq as Father Merrin (Sydow) unearths ancient ruins and something else, but what appeals to most is the build-up of events that lead to the possession and climax of a battle between the demon and the priest. There is also the plight of Father Karras (Jason Miller) who's faith hinders on a constant barrage of test perhaps targeting him as the storys reluctant hero, but one of my favorite actors in the film is Jack MacGowran as Burke Dennings, movie director and collegue of Chris McNeil. I remember MacGowrans memorable comedy, \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\" (1967) as a bumbling and incompetent vampire killer with his ever inexperienced sidekick, Roman Polanski and sexy Sharon Tate as the host vampires love interests, but thats another film.<br /><br />Young people today may not have much response to a pea soup vomiting or a head turning completely on axis, because they have been desensitized to more horrific violence through X-BOX games and slasher films today that make The Exorcist seem too fake and even comical, but if we look at the history of cinema beginning with silent film on through to today, one can see just how much harder artists worked in older films whether its comedy, drama or horror to achieve what I see as plastic and overused CGI today. I remember how ministers and preachers responded when The Exorcist came out and they basically fell into two opposite ends of critique, either the film was too fake and unreal as God would allow, or the film was not severe enough in its portrayal of Satan being allusive and isolated in a child, but I think both sides have it wrong. We cannot deny this nations religious state as both superstitious or scientific, so we have films like The Exorcist to measure our own definition(s) of what we fear and what we believe to be real. The Exorcist will always remain a part of my library collection.see as plastic and overused CGI today.

B000SZLSB2|5.0|After I purchased this CD I believe I played it every day for at least 4 months.  His voice is haunting and the lyrics are brilliant. I have bought it for everyone in my family and they too can't stop playing it. His sound is so unique...a combination of rock and folk. The good thing about just finding an artist is that you can get all of their works at once and just totally sturate yourself in their sound. I love all of the James Blunt CDs but I must say that All The Lost Souls remains my favorite.

0553573411|1.0|The first book in the series was decent. Not good, but not bad enough that I stopped there. This book is something else. It really is one of the few worst books I've ever read.<br /><br />***Vague spoilers follow***<br /><br />Everyone in it is unbelievably and unfathomably stupid at all points of the story. They allow friends and family to be killed and the kingdom basically ruined because, well, what, they're supposed to do something about the villain they know to be evil and bent on killing them and who lives in their power?<br /><br />The plotting was so bad and the characters so stupid (as a necessity for the terrible plot to work), I was angry with the book by the time I was a third or so of the way though. Probably less.

1594203334|4.0|I found this on my partner's side of the bedroom and picked it up, intrigued. We have a ten month old which explained why it had appeared. I have to say I found it incredibly humorous. Yes, I sympathised and empathised with the plight of the author and \\"Bean\\"; Yes, I read curiously over various marshmellow experiments, considered appreciately the concepts of \\"delaying\\" and \\"teaching patience through \\"baking\\". All that aside, to all fathers out there, you could do a lot worse than reading this over the plethora of scientific and preachy \\"guides\\" that have created an entire \\"parenting\\" section in every high street bookshop. To be honest, I took the France v UK/USA with a liberal pitch of 'sel' as it came across as a selling gimmick rather than hard science. It merely illustrated that perhaps french parents are more relaxed about parenting, more \\"child ryhthm-attuned\\". Not something that only the French can do!<br />What was important it that it was funny. I actually wanted to read it. Some stuff made sense, I changed a couple of methods with our child. My partner and I read it to each other. Heck, I even read it to my ten month old one night rather than a story about a dog. She giggled along with me.<br />Finally, I found a light-hearted irony in the way Pamela Druckerman castigates the \\"over-parenting, method-obsessed, book and magzine article-focused\\" nature of UK and US parents - then gives us yet another book on the matter.<br />Fathers should read this. Mums should stick this in their husband's Xmas stockings just to get them to read a parenting book because, like me, he'll appreciate it, find it humorous and engaging. And...because fathers will like to read it, they might just find something useful in it.

But, my mohter-in-law purchased the book and raved about it, so I went about reading it.

When I first opened the book, and realized it was in the first person from her perspective, I worried that this was going to be the most boring book ever.

B0058EBNAO|4.0|This app is quite striking.  I love the look, it's easy to see what's going on weather wise, with a lot of options for views.  It's one of my favorite apps.  The only quibble I have is that the dew point option has disappeared.  The dew point is crucial for knowing if it's okay to turn off the a/c and open the windows or not.  The weather this year in New England has been very unusual, much warmer than normal, and a lot of days when the dew point is in the 70s.  This is not the tropics, folks.  Dew point matters to how well you can function going about your day.  Sticky and soaking is not a good working state.  Please, put the dew point function back, or if I've just lost it, tell me how to fix it, please.  Won't give up this app without it, cause it's great anyway, but I miss that function.<br /><br />UPDATE:[Dew point is back.  It must have been something I did.

0312370849|5.0|This is a riveting novel written around the French round up of Jews during WWII in Paris. The plot you can read elsewhere on the main page about the book. The tale is told with compassion and starkness, and the characters fully realized. The suspense in the book is marvelously done, even though you can guess at parts of the outcome, the details are stunning when they are disclosed. Enjoy this, and then, like I was inspired to, go research the history of this round up of Jews and how they were treated and handled in France in this tragic incident under the Nazis by French authorities.

1451678193|5.0|I first read Martian Chronicles at age 12, and find them just as compelling at age 59. It's important to remember that Bradbury wrote these stories in the late 40s, LONG before we had any idea what Mars was actually like (atmosphere, etc.) and long before we entered the space age. Considering that, his vision is extraordinary, particulary regarding how humans might view Mars and if we'd respect what might be there or take it over and ruin it.
0062082353|4.0|I have to admit that while this book was very good overall, I did not really like the style Chris used by jumping around so much. He did so especially in the beginning of the book.<br /><br />With that said, I did really enjoy the book. I am glad that I didn't get the kindle version. Some books just need to be read the old fashion way. Normally, I read books about leadership with a few fiction titles thrown in for variety. I thoroughly enjoy military books but my favorite still has to be American Soldier by Gen. Tommy Franks (ret) and while Chris' book doesn't center around leadership, it still does tell good stories and makes him one of the people I'd like to have a beer with and swap stories with.

B007X4ECMI|3.0|When I saw the trailer for LOCKOUT before it hit theaters I thought it looked interesting but not enough for me to shell out the $8 for a matinee ticket. Actually there are few movies these days that make me feel that way. So I'm happy to report that the movie, just released on DVD, is well worth that $8 and more. No, it's not LAWRENCE OF ARABIA but it does offer plenty of entertainment for your money.<br /><br />The year is 2079 and Guy Pearce is Snow, an ex-CIA agent caught in a trap where an old friend was killed but not before passing him a briefcase. Snow escapes with the briefcase but only enough time to pass it on to his friend Mace. Caught by the new agent in charge Scott Langrel (Peter Stormare), Snow is unwilling to give up any information and quickly sentenced to 30 years in stasis (frozen) on the newest prison rotating in space above the Earth.<br /><br />Before he can get there though things happen. Emilie Wornock (Maggie Grace), the daughter of the President, is at the space station looking things over to make sure there are no civil rights violations going on. The group she works with is looking into illegal activity taking place there, experimentation on the inmates. To interview one he must be \\"thawed\\" as all prisoners are encapsulated in their cells. During this interview he takes a gun from the Secret Service man assigned to Emilie (that he snuck in) and begins to set free all the prisoners.<br /><br />A rescue mission is set up to save the President's daughter but her chances of survival are slim. In steps Harry Shaw (Lennie James), a friend of Snow's who's been trying to help him and get information from him. He suggests that Snow is the only person alive who can be snuck onto the orbiting station and rescue Emilie without harm. Put in place as a back up plan the first attempt to rescue her fails and he heads in.<br /><br />Via a tracking chip on Emilie Snow is directed to her location and tries to save her but it thwarted by her Secret Service agent. He gets around this eventually and tries to help her. While this is going on one of the worst prisoners, Alex (Vincent Regan) takes charge and sets about negotiating with those in charge for her release. Alongside him is his brother Hydell (Joseph Gilgun), a totally mad screw up who finds more pleasure in killing people than negotiations. These two along with some of the most deadly men to ever walk the Earth are now searching for Snow and Emilie with one purpose in mind: escape.<br /><br />If that wasn't enough plot for you consider this extra. Mace is now imprisoned on the space prison too. Snow needs to find the briefcase he entrusted to him before he was caught to take down the bad guys that framed him and killed his friend. All he has to do is find him among the 500 or so insane criminals now set free while saving the President's daughter at the same time.<br /><br />Many of the ideas found in this movie could have resulted in a truly bad low Z grade movie. But the cast, crew and writers up the ante and make it more fun than you would think possible. With the exception of a not too realistic CGI motorcycle chase, the effects are top notch. Everything from explosions to space situations seem real.<br /><br />The thing that makes this work more than anything though is the acting by Pearce and Grace in their roles. Snow is a smart aleck, self assured, one man force who has the ability to save the seemingly pampered President's daughter. Emilie is the naive young woman who thinks she knows what's going on but clearly has no clue. When you couple the two together they both learn something, though Snow seems more in line to teach than learn.<br /><br />The pacing is fast and furious and shot fantastically so that you catch it all on the screen. The concept of a rescue mission is well thought out even if the plans to make it happen fall apart over and over again. This movie is pure popcorn flick of the week and takes you on a ride that delivers on all accounts.I've always said that the first purpose of a movie should be to entertain. With this film I found myself knowing I could watch it a second time and enjoy it again, making it a film worth seeing.I've always said that the first purpose of a movie should be to entertain.

0345803493|1.0|Need more repetitive sex in your life? Read about it here.  I enjoyed the first novel in the series, as a fun, naughty, beach read.  Honestly though, you'll get sick of Ana and even Christian after this one.  For two people who potentially have everything, they sure do find dull ways to make each other miserable.
B0087DFIYA|4.0|Mel Gibson has become the movie star folks love to kick around. First when he made PASSION OF THE CHRIST folks in Hollywood laughed at him...until the movie became a blockbuster. When he went through his public divorce he was ridiculed. Arrested on drunk driving charges and making anti-Semitic remarks? Screaming at an ex-girlfriend and mother of his youngest child? Yep he was guilty of all these things. And yet he continues to work and make movies. But we're a society more interested in the lifestyles of the rich and famous than their movies. Me? I could care less. I want to know if the movies he makes are good. GET THE GRINGO, his latest, is fantastic.<br /><br />Gibson stars as a bank robber on the run as the film opens. With a wounded partner and the border patrol on his tail, he heads for the Mexican border and jumps the fence there. When the Mexican border guards find the money in his back seat, they take custody of him. Carted off to jail without his money (that the guards have taken for themselves), Gibson is tossed into one of the worst jails of all times.<br /><br />The jail is a city unto itself. If guards exist here you never see them with the exception of the walls. Instead a crime boss named Javi controls everything in the prison from where you live to the drugs or guns you want. Living in his own mansion of sorts, he has family members run his business for him. As he navigates this prison, Gibson's character (never given a name) takes note of everything that goes on around him. He knows his only chance for survival is to make himself useful to Javi.<br /><br />Gibson also gets to know someone who can help him understand what's going on and help him on this path. The Kid (Kevin Hernandez) is a low level hustler who Javi always seems to protect. There is a reason for this that becomes apparent later on (I won't surprise you here). As Gibson finds his way in the prison, he takes the kid under his wing as well. The kid's mother (Delores Heredia) isn't pleased at first, but eventually she takes a liking the Gibson.<br /><br />While Gibson is making his way through this new territory the men he robbed to start the film off are looking for him. They track down the border cops and torture them to find out where he is. And with enough money behind them, the find their way into the prison armed to the teeth to take Gibson out. What follows is one bloody battle that you won't forget and the need for Gibson to make his move earlier than he intended to.<br /><br />There are several things that make this movie work, first and foremost Mel Gibson. As he's aged Gibson has a weathered look about him that suits the character in this movie. This is a man who has seen hard times and in so doing knows how to accomplish his goals no matter who he has to use to do so. His character is all about self preservation and nothing more. But as the film progresses we notice his character begin to open a bit and to find a certain fondness for the kid.<br /><br />The setting of the story plays a major role in the success of this film. You've never seen a prison like this before and hopefully never will in person. The core of the film was based on the true stories of prisons like this in Mexico, some of which have been closed down. How people survive here, how Gibson finds his way around and the interaction between characters in the prison adds to the film.<br /><br />The last thing that makes this film stand out is the script. Well written much of the story unfolds through the sarcastic narration of Gibson's character. His world weary ways present themselves as he begins with \\"hello kids...\\" telling his tale. I once read that many found this character to be much like the character of Porter from Gibson's film PAYBACK. It is very much like that character, a hard core criminal that for some reason you seem to like. This film could easily be a follow up to that film. It would make a great double feature anywhere.<br /><br />If you like Gibson you'll find this to be one of his better films. The range of emotion he displays through subtle looks and gestures makes this one of his best performances. If you don't like Gibson because of the personal problems get over it and watch the movie for the entertainment value. We all have problems in our personal lives; unfortunately movie stars have them displayed on the front page. If you can forget that for just a while, you'll be watching a good movie.l find this to be one of his better films.

B005LAII0S|2.0|I have to say after watching so many modern day versions of fairy tales I've decided I've joined to ranks of old fogies. I just don't like new fangled updates of classic tales. Perhaps that's not fair. Reworking a classic fairy tale while not saying so directly has turned out okay for some films. But to say this is the real thing when it's not makes for some bad movies. Like MIRROR MIRROR.<br /><br />From all the advertising and promotions you would think that this movie isn't about Snow White at all and in a sense you'd be correct. It even begins with the evil queen narrating the tale. As played by Julia Roberts all I could think of while watching this was that she's gone from a talented actress to one that wants to be the center of attention. The evil queen is a part of the story but not the focus.<br /><br />The fairy tale gets twisted to suit the needs of the actors involved with the King marrying the Queen (Julia Roberts) while Snow (Lilly Collins) is young, disappearing and leaving the Queen in charge. Snow lives more along the lines of Cinderella without the work involved, forced to stay out of the public eye while the queen throws parties and more.<br /><br />Traveling through a local forest is Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) seeking fame and fortune. Unfortunately he is set upon by bandits in the form of seven dwarves on bouncing stilts. Robbed of clothing and money, the Prince is saved by Snow and taken to the castle where the Queen takes a fancy to him, not just because of his looks but because her constant spending has left the castle treasury empty. When Snow catches the eye of the Prince the Queen becomes jealous and has her taken to the forest to be killed, but we know how that ends.<br /><br />Instead Snow finds the home of the thieving dwarves and asks to be taken in just for the night.

B007UW9WOQ|4.0|The difference between a good documentary and a bad one lies in the ability of the storyteller to draw the viewer in and make him interested in the subject matter. A bad documentary about an interesting subject can kill and a good documentary on a subject that most don't care about can pull you in. Most lie somewhere in the middle. But then there are documentaries that are simple and elegant and you suddenly find yourself wanting to watch till the end. JIRO DREAMS OF SUSHI is one of those films.<br /><br />Jiro Ono is a master sushi chef. His title and abilities have been developed over a period of nearly 75 years. At 85 he continues to come to work every day, hating those days when he's not there. Working in a small restaurant in the basement of a Tokyo office building, Jiro has become the ultimate man to speak of when it comes to sushi. His restaurant was the first to garner a three star rating from Michelin, the ultimate achievement for those included.<br /><br />Rather than focus on the years it took for Jiro to establish himself the film looks at his life now and his two sons, Yoshikazu and Takashi. The obligatory back history is provided but not the main idea presented. Instead the film looks at the life of Jiro and his obsession for perfection. To this day even after the accolades he has received he continues to feel he can do better and strives to do so. Each piece of sushi is hand crafted by Jiro to make it not just a source of nourishment but an enjoyment for the customer as well.<br /><br />At 85 Jiro can't carry on forever and the film delves into the lives of his sons as well. Yoshikazu is 50 and works in the restaurant alongside his father. He is a master of the craft as well but will forever live in the shadow of his father. And yet he stays and helps, learning every day and passing the information on to those who work with them.<br /><br />Takashi has moved on and created his own restaurant elsewhere in town. Like his brother, he too will have to live in the shadow of his father. But even if these two men only achieve half the success of Jiro, they will become legendary in their own right.<br /><br />The film follows everything about the life of Jiro with the exception of being home. Since most of his time is spent at the restaurant that's where most of it takes place. He talks of how dedicated he is to this world. He also talks about how he wasn't always there for his sons when they were growing up. But the dedication to his profession and his family shines through.<br /><br />I don't like sushi but even I wanted to try some of the items on display in this film. Jiro does indeed make incredible looking food but simple food as well. His philosophy on what he makes comes through from the start.<br /><br />By the film's end it does what every great documentary does, it draws you into its topic and holds you there for 81 minutes. You find yourself wondering what a trip to Tokyo would be like and how you would find this small restaurant, knowing that to get in you need to make reservations a month in advance. And you find yourself admiring this small 85 year old man for living the life he chose and finding happiness in that. It's all anyone can hope for.e in the shadow of his father.

B005FITIF0|3.0|I've always been a fan of Gerard Butler. Most found him interesting when he starred front and center on both PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and 300. I think he's been good not only in those films but the ones most right off as being bad like THE BOUNTY HUNTER and THE UGLY TRUTH. It takes a good actor to make a bad movie enjoyable and Butler has done so. His latest isn't a bad movie but he does make it one worth watching.<br /><br />Butler stars as Sam Childers, a biker about to be released from prison with a drug addiction problem who finds crime the easiest way to make a living. When he's released he returns home to discover that his wife Lynn (Michelle Monaghan) has given up her old ways. No longer working as a stripper, she has a respectable job and has found religion. Unhappy with this turn of events, Sam heads out to a bar with his friend and cohort Donnie (Michael Shannon).<br /><br />On their way home they pick up an Indian hitchhiker who threatens them with a knife. Sam takes the knife from him, stabs him repeatedly and tosses the body out of the car.<br />Reaching home Sam tries to wash the blood off, horrified at what he has done. With Lynn at his side, she helps him find his way to God.<br /><br />Sam gets his act completely together. He starts a construction company and when he hears God talking to him builds a church for people like himself, outcasts from society who need a place to pray and find help. He rescues Donnie from the life he was once leading. When he meets a missionary from Africa talking about the atrocities that are going on there, he decides to investigate further.<br /><br />Heading to the Sudan he sees the effects of the war there on the children of the area. When he gets home he tells Lynn that God has called on him to build a refuge for these children and sets out to do so. Gathering any funds and donations he can, Sam does build the church and orphanage. But the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army) who stand against these children and their families take offense and attack his stockade. Picking up a weapon, Sam joins his protectors to run them off and a legend is born.<br /><br />Keeping the orphanage and church open is not an easy task and Sam is tested time and again for his beliefs. His fighting is rare if at all but that changes one night. On the way home after rescuing several children, Sam comes across a number of children stranded by the roadside. Only able to take so many in his truck, he promises to come back for the rest. By the time he does so he returns to find nothing more but their charring bodies burned by the LRA. This sends him over the edge and from then on he carries a weapon which he uses with more frequency.<br /><br />There is no real ending to this tale. Based on the true story of the real Sam Childers his fight carries on. During the closing credits we get to see footage of the real Sam as he talks about his journey and shows us the church here at home and in Africa. It is an inspiring story that some will side with and other condemn. Those who think everything must be done to save these children will side with Childers. Those who feel you must turn the other cheek will dismiss it. But once you get into the mind of this man who has sacrificed so much for so many, you won't have a choice but to admire him for who he is and what he accomplished.ake offense and attack his stockade.

0345803485|2.0|50 shades is an okay easy read. As someone not in their 20s, I found some of the girly angst silly, the writing was simple and easy to read with just the right amount of \\"insert plot twist here\\" to keep the reader interested. But I found I wanted to skip the silly teeny bopper relationship crap and just get to the wild sex. 50 shades has excellent descriptive eroticism, obvious written well but I found the plot similar to the main character: slow, stubborn, and immature. This book is more Twilight Rated R, rather than full-on erotic BDSM. That said, its a nice escape from reality, therefore readable.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice app for the weather update are pretty accurate.  Works very well on a Kindle fire. Keep them coming Amazon.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I was surprised. Without the EQ boost, I really didn't notice anything, at first. However, I soon realized that the audio sounded more spacious.<br /><br />I then took down the EQ levels closer to normal on my player and played around with the E6's EQ boost, and that made a really impressive difference. It gave the orchestral numbers the right sound.<br /><br />I was actually getting bummed that my Pioneer Loops, found at places for $40, handled orchestral better, but not after using this device.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I have bought this workout 4 times, i have loaned it out 3 times and no one has ever returned it.  All have loved it and IT WORKS.  I am keeping this one.  I used it faithfully for 3 months and could see definite results in 30 days.  I incorporated my workout with 2 mile walks daily and lost approx 32 lbs in 2 months.  I absolutely love this workout.

B008EL4YX6|5.0|Normally I wouldn't bother to leave a review, but this game is one of the gems that Amazon has put up for the FAOTD. No ADS, No Annoying Prompts to rate the game, and best of all no temptation for in-game purchases.<br /><br />Ichi is a very simple one button game where you try to collect all the \\"coins\\" for lack of a better term with a bouncing ball. Your goal is to collect all the \\"coins\\" within a limited number of moves. It starts off easy enough and slowly ramps you up difficulty at a very nice and pleasing rate. Looking forward to getting more into the stages and developing a few of my own.

B0030V0PEW|4.0|I am a fan of checklists working in food processing plants. From the launch of new products to starting a line, nothing beats checking boxes so you don't miss any of the 234 steps and have all the 22 required approbations before pushing the button start. This book shows that checklists should be used everywhere to improve quality and ensure compliance . It also shows vividly that it could empower people, by giving them responsibility over their own actions instead of waiting for the order or  an auditor telling them what to do. It gives more control over one's time. It helps training for difficult and complex  tasks by splitting them in comprehensible bits, and can help build confidence. The many examples from hospitals to the building industry illustrate the need for such simple, cheap and available tools as checklists. In terms of returns on investment, be it in lives saved, quality or costs, it's difficult to beat. I recommend this book to everyone. (Too) short? A guide on how to get started and examples of existing check lists in different areas would be a needed improvement. For the next edition

0345803507|5.0|I had to read this book after hearing all the hype about it.  It did not disappoint.  It's not the best written work I have read but very entertaining.
B0085X31VE|5.0|I've had to go back and edit this review several times.<br /><br />One reason for that is that this album has me totally stunned.<br /><br />Perhaps blown away would be a better choice of words?  It doesn't matter -- what matters is this: this is one of the greatest albums I've ever heard, in my life, in the past several years.  Maybe in my life.<br /><br />I don't know how to classify it.  More orchestrally beautiful than much progressive metal... yet harsher and faster and more furious than it too.  Yet softer than speed or thrash, with vocals that are between an anguished scream and a saddened whisper.<br /><br />Perhaps you should listen to some of the tracks on youtube: but know that until you listen to the tracks in full fidelity you'll be missing out.  And to miss out on this masterpiece would be a real shame.<br /><br />A real, true shame.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I am an old hand at these types of puzzles and was pleasantly surprised at the large number of puzzles this game contains and their varying complexity.  It is also one of the best games of this type as far as the controls go, with a nice multi-fill feature for long rows of the same type mark.  I have been playing this specific game off and on for weeks now, and still have plenty of puzzles left.  My only suggestion is the addition of a 'hint' button for those times you get stuck.  Nice game, and well worth the price.  It will last you awhile.
B008OUTQ6C|5.0|She can belt it out, and she can be soft and breathy.  She uses a wide variety of voice qualities in her debut album.  The musical arrangements are often polyrhythmic in this genre-crossing album that reflects the diverse musical influences of her childhood.<br /><br />I learned of this album from a review on National Public Radio, so prospective purchasers might want to visit the NPR website to get another perspective on this artist and her first album.
B0054JELTI|5.0|Almost everyone loves this movie.  It is a great story for the kids but there are a lot of quirky situations that will keep the adults interested and amused.  The animation is astounding.  The regular wide screen version looks great but mine disappeared(borrowed?).  I had to replace it.  I figured I should upgrade to the Bluray.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|If you've been enjoying Katy Perry's singles on the radio, then you will probably enjoy this CD.  The majority of the CD is the radio singles you've been hearing so much of lately, with a few bonus songs thrown in.  My favorite bonus song is the acoustic version of \\"The One That Got Away\\"... much more sad, lilting, yet heartfelt than the one they usually play on the radio.
B005LAIHPY|1.0|You could say that I am actually quite childish as far as my taste for movies goes.. so an action/sci-fi/special effect movie must be bad, really bad for me to dislike it.. but trust me, this one is!<br />I understand that this kind of movie is \\"just entertainment\\" and should not be \\"analyzed\\" too seriously.. but to try to enjoy this flick you actually have to completely sink your mind..<br />You 're supposed to swallow the fact that one of the spaceships of a race advanced enough to deal with interstellar travelling can't do anything better than smash into a satellite while approaching the earth and getting destroyed by it. Then we are told that the spaceships are going toward some sort of astronomical radio station in the Hawaii.. and that should be because they lost their communication spaceship.. never mind the fact that they started targeting the station *before* that ship crashed...Then for some mysterious reason the alien ships after creating a huge energy shield to isolate the Hawaii do not attack and destroy the us and Japanese destroyers trapped in the energy field unless those ships fire on them first and happily ignore all the others...and these should be aliens keen on destroying the humans?? Actually if you follow the action with a minimum of attention you realize that it's actually the US navy who fires the first lethal weapon and starts the conflict.. I don't think the authors themselves realized this, probably used to the fact that after WW 2 if a war starts it's usually the US who started it..<br />Anyhow , as if this wasn't demential enough, we are supposed to believe that an emitter \\"five time more powerful than any before it\\"(wow!) who started communication in 2006 has made contact with aliens living on an earthlike planet just discovered by NASA..and caused them to show up on earth in just six years time... too bad that there are only 4 stars in a 6 light years radius..and the closest is more than 4 light years away..which leaves less the 2 years for the aliens to rush towards Earth faster than light to crash one of their ships (the most important one , of course..) on a puny satellite.. and of course these superadvanced aliens who can defy the most advanced physics we know have to wait for us to discover their planet..Come on! Who writes this stuff???  I suppose who wrote this stuff assumed that the average public watching this flick would not have the faintest culture about modern physics and astronomy.. but still! (or maybe the authors themselves did not have the faintest idea about physics..)<br />Or is it actually forbidden for some reasone to make a sci-fi movie that has a little respect for the \\"sci part\\" in its genre?<br />And even forgetting about science and limiting ourselves at common sense I know military and government are usually not the brightest people on the planet, but if they want to stop this communication link, instead of trying to destroy the observatory, *why don't they blow the damn satellite up???*  And it goes on, and on , and on with nonsense after nonsense..<br />Even a kid could have written something better than this with 5 minutes of thinking.. like the aliens wanting to fight a \\"human champion vs alien champion\\" battle to respect some form of cultural code before invading the planet.. or if you want the classic \\"tension builder\\" of having to avoid some terrible impending disaster, how about the alien created a shielded base to settle , build more weapons and machinery and maybe some sort of \\"final weapon\\" that they could not bring along in the interstellar travel?<br />And do we want to talk about the abysmal acting quality? Or the stereotypical, \\"plastic\\", monodimensional characters? You're really left with the impression that someone had some self over CGI effect from the transformer series and hastily put together this demential story to squeeze some more cash out of them...rs for the aliens to rush towards Earth faster than light to crash one of their ships (the most important one , of course..) on a puny satellite.. and of course these superadvanced aliens who can defy the most advanced physics we know have to wait for us to discover their planet..Come on!

1582406723|4.0|Most people who like the show arent even aware that there was first a comic. Which is sad but because the book is way better. And I love zombie movies/shows.  In the book we don't have that annoying ass hick that everyone seems to love in the show. Thank heavens.<br /><br />The art in here is sold though not amazing. It fits the Image comic genre well. The zombies are satisfyingly grotesque. The characters are for the most part distinguishable and unique. Though with it being a black and white title I find that too many of the female charcters tend to blend into eachother and you find yourself going \\"wait who is she again?\\". But over all the art works and fits well with the writing.<br /><br />The writing and story are strong but like other people will mention, not shockingly original. Robert is coming far away from the likes of Battle Pope but he pulls it off. I wont spoil the story for you but never get attached to any one character. That would be a mistake.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this version of mahjong!  It's a challenge to beat your own score and time.  Many choices and levels. Easy to download, and it's Free!!
B006GM8NXM|2.0|I would never have watched the show but I read the books(which I loved) and wanted to give the show a try. This is only loosely based on the books and frankly the storyline in the show is nowhere near as interesting. There is WAY too much nudity. Frankly, I am not against it but in this show is overkill-there was plenty of steamy scenes in the book but it was done in a rather classy way. In the show, you might as well be watching soft porn and I think it was COMPLETELy unnecessary as it added nothing to the plot.<br />I also found change in Tara character very annoying-in the book, she is a store owner and a classy lady. In the show, she is black(and in the book she wasn't) and foul mouthed bitch with an attitude and a chip on her shoulder the size of Mount Everest. Her \\"romance\\" with Sam is laughable and there is no chemistry whatsoever. The long drawn out story about her mother getting exorsized is stupid and boring and I couldn't wait for it to end.<br />Maybe if I didn't read books before, I would have felt differently but I was completely dissapointed in this show. I felt like the creators were trying to make sure that they showed topless women as often as possible. Do they really think we won't notice how crappy the story is?
0061714402|5.0|I have been a Megadeth fan since its inception in the 80s.  As such, my review will be slightly skewed (and I refuse to get into the whole spitting match of my group can beat up your group mentality that seems to run rampant in the Metallica vs. Megadeth circuit; for this review's sake, they are both amazing groups and let's leave it at that).  Dave Mustaine's life has been highly publicized, been put under a microscope by the media, and been whispered about for decades now.  This memoir is a cleansing of the soul from the horse's mouth as it were.  It's a very insightful, no-holds-barred look at the man behind the growling voice, the blazing guitar chops, and the sarcastic wit who has alternately inspired die-hard fanaticism and cruel ridicule from the masses.<br />His odyssey from never quite-so-innocent child to a heavy metal idol at peace with his chemical demons and the never-ending competition with his previous band is both amusing and heartrending.  I found myself shocked, teary-eyed, and laughing all at the same time during some passages of this book.  His intelligence and self-deprecating wit jumps out at you from the first word and keeps you by the throat until the last paragraph.  Medadeth fans will have even more respect for the number of destructive hurdles he conquered (many placed in his way by himself); others will find him most intriguing and hopefully will become 'Deth fans themselves.  If you are any sort of metalhead, his book is definitely worth a read.

B0059XTUVI|3.0|I purchased this movie hoping to get a strong picture of an important lady. I got a fairly good movie, an excellent leading actress, but I felt a sense of being \\"let-down\\". I do not feel that I got what I expected.  The movie seems to center around an elderly lady with dimentia who is remembering her life in flashbacks. I think there is too much of the film devoted to her old age. I would have liked to see more on the other aspects of her life. Particularly her interactions with Ronald Regan.<br /><br />Still, there are parts of the filim that are excellent. The make-up people did a wonderful job of making Meryl Streep look like Margaret Thatcher. I liked the portrayal of her marriage and the happiness she appeared to have with her husband. I liked the daughter who had the sole caregiver of her mother (her brother was away). It reminded me a lot of my own problems dealing with an aging mother who is imagining things.<br /><br />Thatcher was a pioneer in that she was the first woman to become prime minister of Britian, a great accomplishment for a woman in our day and age. She proved that a woman can hold a high government office and do the job well. I admire her for that, though I don't totally agree with her politics. Overall I give this movie a rating of 3 stars. -- Valerie Lull, Author, Ten Healthy Teas
B008K3HRF0|1.0|All I can say is that I was disappointed with this and I really, really wanted to like it.  The new story it was embedded in took over and much of the original impact was lost.  Not a bad movie, but if you loved the book you may want to rent this movie first and think about buying it later.  Wish I had.

0553386794|5.0|I picked up the first 3 books in this series a few years ago and they sat on my shelf.  Not because I wasn't interested, but at the time there were stirrings that Martin was never going to finish the series as it was taking years for book 4 to come out.  I didn't want to wait 4 years between books and have no recollection of what had happened.  As it was, the series came out on HBO (which I haven't watched) and I decided if need be I could watch the series to refresh my memory.  Also, becoming such a commercial property with TV shows, video games, card games, etc I figured that might give Martin the kick in the breeches to finish the series.... only time will tell.<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot as it is very in-depth and others have done that well on this board already.  Now, I say the plot is in-depth, but Martin's writing style makes the book an easy read.  He doesn't go off on long winded or unnecessary descriptions of story elements not critical to the plot.  The narrative is very tight.  You won't get bogged down with useless descriptions of clothing or annoying histories that are meaningless.  Martin keeps you in the action and keeps the storyline moving at a brisk pace.  Very little passive voice here.<br /><br />I would say that Martin does draw some good and bad characters as well as those somewhere in the middle.  I find that reading about the gray characters like Tyrion, LittleFinger and \\"The Dog\\" are more interesting as they tend to surprise you more.  You really have no idea what they are going to do next.  Sure Ned is the hero and you root for him because he is the hero with apparently no foibles (except for his bastard Jon Snow), but you learn quickly that the bad guys (Lannisters) have an advantage by playing dirty.  Honor and duty and all that are great, but could Ned ever really succeed against the Lannisters one one one with no army at his back?<br /><br />The book is great!  It's a page turner and I think I burned through the last half of the book in 2 sittings.  It is told from the viewpoint of a handful of characters, but the events for the most part are part of the bigger plot as families jostle for the throne and are contained primarly to the Stark and Lannister family (except for Daenerys).  Some viewpoints are better than others, but I didn't find any of them to be a drag.e book in 2 sittings.

B002BWP4A6|5.0|This film magnificently captures the micro that led to the macro in Germany, the foundation laid in Prussia/Germany back in the early 1800s that led to the explosion we came to know as Nazi Germany. Child abuse, child killing and violations of children back in the 1800s was so bad that the French and English were appalled when they visited Bavaria. And remember it was not a great time to be a child in France and England in that time period so for the French and English to be appalled...well...it had to be really really bad.<br /><br />What happens in childhood doesn't stay in childhood, the festering secrets and festering wounds will manifest in some way. It is what spawned Adi (Adolf's nickname as a boy). We think it's all a great unsolvable mystery as to how a young Bavarian/Austrian boy could get everyone to simply obey him by being a raving lunatic but the answer lies in the secrets of this one German village, then multiply that by thousands of villages with similar parental authorities enthroned in simple households raging and torturing children and there you have it.<br /><br />Read Lloyd deMause's meticulous research or Alice Miller's work. What we can't talk about directly we can speak the truth in film making and this film does truth telling in stark black and white to tell a stark dreadful tale. How cold and calculating the abuse was to those children. The shaming, the humiliation, the degradation, the parental need for absolute control of children and use of children to fulfill the needs of the adults who also had the same childhood experiences.<br /><br />There is no resolution to the film because some elements of Germany still hold on to these same dynamics that fostered the violent explosion, still hold onto the denial, still hold onto the sickness, still hold onto the family secrets, the dirty laundry of Germany.<br /><br />A young German girl,  Anna Rosmus from Passau, Bavaria innocently wrote a paper about Passau's history of helping the Jewish people only to find out in her research the people of Passau lied and covered up. They rabidly verbally attacked her, threatened her and she ended up moving away from Germany for her own and her family's safety. And this was in the 1980s not the 1930s.  That film is called \\"Das schreckliche M&auml;dchen\\", in English it is (very poor translation by the way) \\"The Nasty Girl\\". A better translation is \\"The Horrible Girl\\".  Passau was where little Adi lived when he was very young.<br /><br />Das Wiesse Band is an excellent, excellent film. It's fascinating and important history for the world to know and understand.le only to find out in her research the people of Passau lied and covered up.

B008FQ0S1W|4.0|This is a great dance track, but I thought we'd be getting a little \\"Waiting for that Day\\" soul from George. Regardless, I like the track, his voice is great, though I don't see the point at all in using a computer to modify his voice - just sing it raw.  Was expecting something more soulful, but it's good.  Happy  he had a new song to sing for us.  Thanks, George!

B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book was motivating and an enjoyable read! The author's humor and examples from her own life have motivated me to let go of items I felt bound to for sentimental purposes. It is freeing me to see my stuff does not define me.

B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Bared to you. Loved it from start to finish. Reading about Eva and what she went through in her childhood it was so upsetting and sad. What Gideon and Eva have together is Messed up, but it's also amazing in it's on weird way. Hope that in the next book we can find out the darkness of Gideon's past, which I'm kinda guessing what it is, but not saying it though. I truly hope that Gideon and Eva stay TOGETHER forever. Come on Book 2 wish you where here NOW!!! Sylvia Day your book was Amazing, Thank you.

0786891416|4.0|I'm really glad I read this book! The show (Castle) is hilarious, and whoever they got to write Heat Wave did not disappoint. The characters in the book very much resemble those in the show, and I think that anyone who is a fan of the show will enjoy the novel.<br /><br />Even those people who don't watch Castle but enjoy a good crime novel would enjoy this book, I think.<br /><br />Not too much is given away as to who the real murderer is, and I definitely didn't figure it out when Nikki Heat did. I was more with Jameson Rook on this one. I guess that's why I'm not a detective.<br /><br />I also really liked how \\"Castle\\" played with the relationship between Nikki and Jameson. I thought it was very well done - Nikki trying to pretend she doesn't have feelings for Jameson and Jameson just egging her on with his obvious feelings for her. Plus, I think it's kind of hilarious that he's figured out how to trick her even though she's an amazing detective. And the way she manipulates him is great too.<br /><br />I would probably give this novel a 4/5, for being entertaining, intriguing, and true to the show. It was an easy read, and I don't think it would take anybody very long to get through it if they were interested in reading it. I'm excited to start reading Naked Heat next to see where Nikki and Jameson go from here!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I could give zero stars I would!!  I really do not understand the hype this book is getting.  I've read some bad books in my life but this one takes the cake.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else!
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Only played the first few levels but I do like the games simplicity and yet it's also a challenge. In many ways it reminds me of Quell (which I absolutely adore) but with a faster pace. All told an excellent FAOTD.<br /><br />Do not let the screen shots fool you into thinking this is any easy childish game because it's not. In fact I'd go as far as to say it's rather fiendish!<br /><br />The user developed levels seem to be of varied quality but don't let that distract you. There were 2600 of them as of a few minutes ago so there's bound to be some good ones in there.

B004U52VPS|4.0|After having read many of the reviews, I wanted to share that I think this toy could be made fun by the adaptability of it by the user. If something isn't going quite as planned or instructed, I just improvise! I get creative, allow for flexibility of use, and take advantage of opportunities for problem-solving - not only how to use the toy as intended, but how one might use it otherwise. Some children may not have the ability to use the toy as originally designed, but that doesn't mean the toy can't be fun - I make it fun by bending the rules to allow the child to experience success. After all, experiencing successes along with challenges builds motivation to persevere. \\"Angry Birds\\" is meant to be fun and funny so I try not to take the duds too seriously.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The lost city has been a fun game for my grandkids as well as myself. I have spent hours just exploring all the avenues you can take and the options that are available.

B007R41E8O|3.0|I have enjoyed playing this game. It was a little difficult to find some of the needed items but to me that is part of the challenge. I play late at night when I cant sleep. It is addictive and keeps you on edge wondering what is going to happen next or where it is going next. I have found it interesting.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|Who knew that you can make a puzzle game that is so simple looking but yet so challenging? - Ichi is one of those original idea puzzle based game that I have seen in years. Beautiful simple looking game and love the school type score card rating 'A' 'B' or 'C' rather than bunch of numbers.<br /><br />Love the simplicity of the game menu design and love the challenging puzzle. Love the ability to create your own levels! - Kudos for the developers! This will remain in my app list forever!<br /><br />There are no serious permission issues. There are modules embedded in the application for advertising but nothing to be alarmed about.<br /><br />Thanks! for making it free on Amazon and coming tomorrow the $1.99 is definitely worth the price for people who love puzzles! - Four full stars from me!<br /><br />Cheers!
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Rarely do I get the joy of playing something that I haven't seen before, and rarer still is it so simple yet complex. Ichi is an incredible game that revolves around hitting (and collecting) all the given circles on a level with the help of a streaking ball, while avoiding its destruction (through spikes).<br /><br />This ball is controlled through objects that surround it; such as triangles that change direction or disappear (these are what is mainly used to send your ball toward the other objects), blocks that get destroyed or phase out after your ball hits them, walls, lines that your ball creates, objects that split your ball into two, and even teleporters!<br /><br />The beautiful thing is how one interacts with all these objects - through a simple TAP on your screen.<br /><br />Want the triangles to disappear or change direction? - Tap. Want to send your ball into a teleporter? Arrange these triangles so their corners and the balls movement do the job for you - and all through just tapping your screen. Don't overdo it though, as you are given a letter grade based on the amount of taps you used (not the amount of time it took you to beat the level, so plan accordingly).<br /><br />Later levels get quite intense and the game ships with 60 of them. That may not sound like much (because each level only takes a few minutes at most to complete), but it also ships with a tool that allows you to create your own levels! I want to say a big thank you to the author for making the editor so easy to use, and because of it - there are over 2491 published levels (that you can play for free) as of this review (and more are created by the minute).<br /><br />A lot of these levels are somewhat bad, but thankfully you can sort them by \\"Popular\\" and \\"Best Rated\\", meaning you only get to play what other's have already tested for you. I found some of the \\"Popular\\" levels to be amazing.<br /><br />This game really is the complete package, which is tied together by its overly simplistic yet appropriate graphics. If you look at any of the screenshots, Ichi looks like it is played on graph paper with hand drawn objects, and this look fits the game perfectly. The sound is as adequate as it can be in a game like this, and also fits its minimalistic approach.<br /><br />My only complaint is its use of a few permissions (opening network sockets and its ability to access information about networks). I assume these are included because of the level download and share component, but I wish the game used another way to do it. It also requires read only access to phone state, and the ability to write to external storage, but honestly those aren't too bad.<br /><br />At just $1.99, I can't recommend this game enough. It has virtually unlimited re-play value and a rapidly growing community of level designers. Thumbs up, WAY UP. This is one of the best puzzlers on the Android OS.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great I love it. they are so fun like tonuge twisters I wish there was anthor one like flow free

B004LWZW24|5.0|I find it not a little ironic that one of the best PG-13 modern horror films should come from the producers of Saw, one of the goriest franchises in history.  Regardless, they've done a very good job, and hopefully other horror films will follow this example.<br />Gore is no longer scary to modern horror audiences.  Thanks to modern technology, we can see someone rip out another's still-pumping heart, and this has become boring to us.  Gore can be effective when used correctly, but such occurrences are few and far in-between.  The horror market has been flooded with rubbish like Hostel and Cabin Fever, films relying on gratuitous gore or torture scenes, for too long.  Audiences are longing for films capable of providing chills and racing hearts, not brief gross-out moments.  Thankfully, some horror producers are recognizing this.<br />Insidious is the classic haunted-house ghost story with a twist, which I won't spoil for prospective audiences.  I have few criticisms regarding the acting or plot; for the most part, this film does what it set out to do.  There are a few cheesy moments, of course, and I wish the film had been more subtle at times, but there weren't any major mistakes that ruined the film.  The atmosphere is consistent, the film spends time building up suspense and the mood, and there are enough comic-relief moments to let you fully realize how tense the story has become.<br />I'd recommend this to horror fans and newcomers to the genre, particularly young ones with little experience in horror.

014241011X|5.0|I first read this book when I was in the third grade, 25 years ago. I instantly decided then that it was my favorite book and I read and re-read it many times. I loved it. I recently took on a research project involving children's and young adult stories and have a long reading list of Children's stories to read - I put \\"The Witches\\" at the top of my list for nostalgia's sake, not sure what to expect.<br /><br />As an adult, I can report, that it is simply a magnificent story. I can see why I loved it so much as a child. Dahl never dismisses the reader (children) as being inept. Like the Grandmother in the story, Dahl knows children don't require extreme coddling. He's not timid about using fear to tell a great story.<br /><br />Parent's strive to create a safe world for their children. But that illusion is one that all parents must slowly deconstruct to prepare children for reality. Fairy tales are an integral part of that deconstruction. In fairy tales, monsters can exist in a way that allows children face their fears and walk through those fears to the other side where strength, courage and confidence are found.<br /><br />\\"The Witches\\" is a frightening, yet thrilling read for children. Dahl is a masterful storyteller and in \\"The Witches\\" he has weaved imagination, fear and courage into a fantastically fun story that has stood the test of time and remains refreshingly relevant  for each generation.
B00371QQ34|4.0|This is a two sided disc, blu ray on one side, dvd on the other. The packaging was ok, but somehow the blu ray was scratched in a couple different places. I didn't scratch it, all my movies are flawless, I'm OCD about that! It still works, but it's just the principal that I paid for a brand new movie that had scratches on it right out of the box. The movie itself was excellent!

0345803485|1.0|I thought that with all of the hype in the media about this book, it would do a job of capturing the reader's attention and not earn its controversial position because recent celebrities have been sited reading it only revealing their interest in it's erotic content. I started this novel about 5 days ago and already reached chapter 20 with only a few chapters remaining.<br /><br />I can't take it anymore. It did not add up to me that this novel could be so popular on the Internet and among journalists and anger so many individual readers. I'm mad at myself for even buying the book, but it's earned a nice place in the garbage from me. In general, the characters are flat, the sexual content is so unrealistic that it sounds like a 15 year old boy in need of some intense counseling, and it's so poorly written that even when I myself would go back to read it, I'd forget what I was reading.<br /><br />I don't know if the authors intentions were to get herself off while writing this, but if so, maybe she should seek some counseling as well because it surely didn't get me off and from the looks of the other reviews, it isn't even a good book for recreational purposes.<br /><br />I also would like to say that for those of you who wrote a bad review, kudos, I don't feel so alone anymore, and for those of you who think its the best book you've ever read, please go and get some psychological treatment. This woman probably isn't capable of writing on a post-it.

B007Y56JDQ|5.0|I have been waiting for a dvd of Richard Marx playing with a band rather than just in an acoustic setting.  This dvd features both settings with the acoustic set in the first half and then Richard rocking out with the band for the last half. Great stuff.  As an added bonus there is a CD featuring 10 songs from the show plus 2 bonus tracks.<br /><br />The cd and dvd both sound fantastic and the dvd runs out at around 2 hours.<br /><br />There are a number of special guests on the dvd including Sara Niemietz, Matt Scannell, JC Chasez and Hugh Jackman.  In my experience special guests don't always work well but in this case they do.  Nothing takes away from Richard Marx as the undoubted star of the show even in this company.<br /><br />If you want a great concert dvd showcasing the talents of a master singer/songwriter this is it.

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|A surprisingly good film based on a series of novels written by the man who brought us \\"Tarzan of the Apes.\\" While some cinema SF fans will be put off by the notion of a Civil War veteran being transported to Iron-Age Mars and eventually saves an alien princess from evil forces, I enjoyed this adaptation of a literary classic, that I glanced at as a boy, very much and I intend to purchase the Blu-Ray edition this week-end. As other reviewers said, maybe the sale of the DVDs will encourage Disney, or a better-managed film studio, to adapt the rest of the series.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Poorly written, characters not relateable, unrealistic representation of an S & M relationship.<br />Please, please, check out literotica.com and the popular authors section for engaging erotic fiction- the authors can also point you in the direction of other written work you may enjoy.
B007C3TVNA|3.0|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" may fascinate you, but not in the way you want it. Some may call it a horror, but definitely not a usual kind of horror. Not many horror movies would employ narrative strategies that are ferociously disorienting like this. The film is about a former travel writer Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) and her son Kevin, whose increasing malicious behavior torments his mother.<br /><br />Told in the chronologically jumbled order (with fragmented images, some of which could be results of the heroine's own imagination), \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" asks us to pick up the pieces and put them into the right places in the storyline. The task interests us at first, but as we come to see the whole picture, we notice that the film does not have much to say.<br /><br />The mother-son relationship that went awry is one of the film's main themes, and the filmmakers should be thankful for the cast especially Tilda Swinton, without whose excellent performances as Kevin's mother the film would have been an unwatchable mess. In fact, whatever you feel about her character, Tilda Swinton (who eerily resembles Ezra Miller as teenage Kevin) is the reason you should see the film.<br /><br />This is the third feature film from Lynne Ramsay, who directed \\"Ratcatcher\\" (1999) and \\"Morvern\\" (2002). I wasn't impressed with any of them though I admit she is quite good at creating atmospheric and surreal images that are both comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time. After her unsuccessful attempt to adapt \\"The Lovely Bones\\" (which Peter Jackson took over), Lynne Ramsay comes back. And she has not changed, for better or worse.<br /><br />Watch for Tilda Swinton, whose great performances barely covers the fact that the film actually lacks depth with its unconvincing characters. It's a beautifully crafted façade that looks disturbing, but has little inside.
0425263908|3.0|I decided to read this book because I miss Christian Grey but wanted to read something new instead of reading 50 Shades over and over again. All the reviews kept saying how similar this was to 50 so I decided to give it a try. It definitely kept me interested but I think 50 is 100x better. Sure BTY is written better but I didn't find the romance near as sexy as 50. And could the author have not chosen less sexier names?? I mean come on! Eva Tramell & Gideon Cross is just not as hot as Anastasia Steele & Christian Grey. And couldn't the author have chosen a different nickname for Eva than Angel?!?! I don't know why but that just got under my skin & I almost had to stop reading it. Baby is 100x better than Angel. Also, I preferred Ana's innocence over Eva's experience. I think that's what made the romance in 50 steamier than BTY plus BTY used naughtier words that almost made me cringe & laugh out loud. I almost couldn't take this book seriously because of that. Anyway, bottom line 50 Shades made me crave more & wished Christian Grey was real whereas this book just leaves me feeling meh. Wouldn't have missed anything if I didn't read it at all. But I will read the 2nd one just to see how Gideon & Eva's story ends.
B001TWT0AE|2.0|Ford gives his take on how law and order came to the western frontier and it is believable if you don't know much history except what you have seen in Westerns. It may also be his answer to High Noon and the theme of one man having to take on outlaws without help from his friends and neighbors. A statehood issue is shoehorned onto this theme. John Wayne is in his usual western character and costume and James Stewart plays his usual B movie character; both are too old for the parts they play; but do give their usual very professional performance. The doctor and newspaperman, as in most westerns, are the town drunks. The plot and subplots are stale, the townspeople are stereotypical of early to mid-20th century westerns. Sadly one scene even confuses the Declaration of Independence with the U.S. Constitution.  This movie is vastly over-rated by most reviewers on this site.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A wonderful end to the Christian and Ana love story.  The writer made you fall in love with both of her characters, not just Christian.  A trilogy that I would read again. I loved that it was based in the Pacific Northwest and I could identify with some of the places and areas of attractions that spoke of in the book.  It helped me feel closer to the characters and be part of the story as I read the book. I cant wait for the movie to be made.
B00031TXBI|4.0|I am a RHCP fan for many years, and I have always appreciated Frusciante's contribution to the band. Until recently, I have never listened to his solo stuff. This is my 2nd solo album of his, and is much more to my liking. Some of his music strays very far off field compared with what we are familiar to hearing from him in the RHCP. I completely understand his need to explore and grow, but that doesn't mean that all of it is listenable. This album, although not funk-based like most of his playing, is very good. I listened to it 3 times last night. Some tracks stood out from the others during the 1st pass (#5), while others took a while -- over the course of multiple listens -- to sink in, but are also very good. What really stands out here is not only his command of the guitar, but his songwriting. His growth as a musician can be clearly seen since he was an 18yo kid when first entering the RHCP. Recommended.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|I tried pairing with wireless headphones several different ways, including following instructions.  The product description states Nano 6th gen is supported but it is not.  iPod website states it is not supported.  When you plug this into iPod Nano 6th gen, you get a message clearly stating it is not supported.  DO NOT BUY FOR AN iPOD 6TH GENERATION NANO.<br /><br />8/15/2012 Update:  I was convinced to try again.  The i10 (not i10s) this time and it does work.  Thanks for all the help!  It takes a really long time to pair initially though, and that may have been the problem.  I'm used to things pairing immediately. This took almost a whole minute to pair.  Sometimes my headset would time out of pairing mode so even this wasn't the smoothest thing but I've got it working now and I really love the freedom.  However, I will be buying the Syre incorporated bluetooth wristband for Nano as soon as it comes out.  Expected availability in November, 2012.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Clockwork Angels is Rush's best album since Power Windows and \\"The Garden\\" is their best song since \\"Time Stand Still\\".  Lifelong Rush fans agree that even bad Rush is better than 90% of what else is out there.  This is an album recorded by the band before, during and after seriously chugging along on their most successful tour [[ASIN:B005D0RDIE Rush: Time Machine 2011 - Live in Cleveland]], in synch, and with musical chops freshly honed and intact.  The concept is bold.  In some ways this is Rush's most ambitious album ever.  Even 2112 was just one side of an album.  Here, the concept holds troughout the entire CD.  Also, however, the songs can stand alone just fine.<br /><br />This is Neil Peart's most personal album lyrically.  Finally, we get an entire album closer to his heart, instead of those rare glimpses of his soul he would give us on songs like \\"Afterimage\\" from Grace Under Pressure or \\"Cold Fire\\" from Counterparts.  These lyrics are similar to his personal writings from his grief journal [[ASIN:1550225480 Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road]] and his travelogue book [[ASIN:B00558YIIW Far and Away: A Prize Every Time]].  Ultimately, I feel that this album is a musical journey through grief, that sense of loss or count of cost, and the grieving process which Neil has personally survived, and lived to tell.  When he says \\"watch out, because sometimes the target is you\\", it sounds like it was written by someone who has felt that way, perhaps after losing a spouse and a child in the same year.  Very ouch.  Very real.<br /><br />Ultimately, that makes this coming of age tale, from the perspective of an old man looking back over his life (not unlike \\"The Fountains of Lamneth\\" by the way), clearly Rush's most emotionally mature work.  It will inspire you re-read Voltaire's \\"Candide\\", Andrew Marvell's \\"To His Coy Mistress\\", and Swift's \\"Gulliver's Travels\\".  It will touch your heart.  It will make you drink red wine and read Hegel and Google \\"thesis, antithesis, synthesis\\".  It will make you appreciate the musical genius of Lee and Lifeson and Peart as one miraculous entity of its own, while at the same time you will bask and bathe in the joy of the lyrical gifts that Neil also possesses.  It will make you ask yourself how so much GOOD got into one band.  Remember when you first heard Rush?  How did 3 guys make this music?  How do they play that?  Get ready to feel that sense of wonder again.  One more thing:  Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame, you are a joke until you put Rush in AND formally apologize.  I officially boycott you until then.  Not a visit.  Not a DVD purchase.  You are dead to me.
B007H9B6KA|5.0|Fans of Garbage will enjoy this album, as it stays true to the edgy pop-rock sound they are known for.  There are a handful of excellent songs (Blood For Poppies, Control, & Sugar are my current favorites), but all the songs are enjoyable. Shirley Manson's voice is as strong and beautiful as ever.  Happy to hear new music from them!!

B005JU5JEI|3.0|Cameron Diaz plays a school teacher (Elizabeth) who is bummed out because she lost her possible ticket to the riches when her rich boyfriend dumps her. She thinks that if she gets a boob job she will be able to capture Mr. Right (anybody who is rich) and quit her day job as a teacher.<br /><br />At school she is obnoxious, rude, and really the total illustration of what you do not want in a teacher. She is trying to hook up with a rich substitute teacher, (Justin Timberlake) whose role is a total geek. What follows is a movie that is part comedy and uses Cameron's beauty to try to make an average movie into a good movie.<br /><br />While there are some laughs the movie just is so blatantly sexual that it just doesn't work well. Cameron's character is so shallow and such a gold digger that you really can't like her and Justin's acting is like a 2 hour Saturday Night Live skit. Cameron's role comes across as cheap and trashy and because of this it detracts from the story.<br /><br />Some comedy but it could have been better with a stronger comedic script and if Cameron's character had a real life and higher aspirations to excel.

B00003CXZ1|5.0|I watch movies to be entertained for 2 hours or so.  This movie fulfilled that requirement.  Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is a tomb raider extraordinaire.  She is the female version of Indiana Jones but with acrobatic skills, fighting skills, brains and looks.<br /><br />She is trying to steal a diamond from a chamber of an Egyptian tomb and she is attacked by a robot.  A fight and chase occurs and Lara defeats the robot and takes the treasure to find out it is a tape of her favorite music.  This action takes place in her home and it is her way of keeping her skills sharp for the real thing.  Unfortunately she doesn't suspect that the real adventure will be even more dangerous and deadly than the practice session could ever be....<br /><br />Angelina Jolie does a superb job in playing this role.  Her acting skills and athletic ability shine in this movie.  It is almost nonstop action and adventure all over the world with Lara being the focus of the movie.<br /><br />Yeah the movie is over the top and silly at times but the premise of the movie is a video game.  Despite Angelina's excellent performance, the storyline and the some parts of the movie didn't measure up to the same high standard.  But I enjoyed it for what it was, entertaining and fun to watch.  I think you will like it also!
B0083GQKQG|5.0|I was riveted by this film, perhaps in part because I so sympathized for Tilda Swinton's character.  Many years ago, when the film \\"The Good Son\\" came out, my younger daughter was deeply affected by it.  She asked what I'd do if I were in the situation of the final scene, holding each of my two daughters by the hand to prevent them from falling to their death, and having to decide which one to let drop so that I could save the other one.  I honestly couldn't conceive of how to make that kind of decision.  \\"Kevin\\" tapped into those same feelings of complete compassion for the parent placed in an untenable situation, torn by fierce and protective love for one's children, and the need to make a decision that could devastate one of them.  Ouch.  It was a thought-provoking and disturbing film, but I was still completely captivated.
B008EL4YX6|4.0|Ichi is a one button puzzle game, I know, I wondered what that was myself.  It is a simple game that quickly gets harder and harder. After the download the game would not start on a Kindle Fire and it forced closed.  Restarting the game allowed it to work.<br /><br />The object is to clear all of the round circles with the ball in as few taps of the screen as possible. The edge of the playing area may have a spike ripple surface and if the ball hits it then the ball is destroyed so remove the circle near that ripple last.  You are rotating triangles by tapping the screen to use them as defectors for the ball.  You can also use the walls of the playing area or the one time use blocks as they break and disappear after you use them.  Plan your strategy well because you can quickly destroy the ball.  Depending on how many taps you use after completing a level you get a grade of A, B, C...<br /><br />You can skip levels and you may have to as the game gets very challenging.  On some levels the triangles used to change the direction of the moving ball change from solid objects to transparent objects that the ball will pass through and they change back to solid objects on alternating taps.  This game is a real brain teaser and will drive you nuts.  It is so challenging that frustration may get you because you want to advance and beat the level.<br /><br />The challenges increase as you get added obstacles like one time block obstacles, teleporters, and even drawing a line to make your own needed barrier.  The game is very simple and quickly gets challenging and hard.<br /><br />The game even features the ability to design your own Ichi game and you can select a game playing box, select objects to put into the maze, add walls and test your own game and then share it with the world.  This means you can design thousands of new games in addition to the original 50 that come with the game.  Designing a game is easy as the tools work well.  You can also play any of the 2,182 user designed games that are available.  They are classified as Newest, Popular, Best Rated, Last Played and there is a Search function.<br /><br />The game's graphics are extremely simple but game play is complex on many levels and difficult to beat.  You will have to try to beat some levels multiple times.  I liked the game and I gave it four stars for creativity and imagination.  This is not a slow paced relaxing puzzle game as one wrong move can force you to add multiple moves to correct your mistake, that is if you don't destroy the ball.

B000LJAEFG|5.0|Admittedly, the five stars I give 'Brainstorm' has more to do with love than actual cinematic achievement, but even so, 'Brainstorm' stands out as one of the most intelligent and exciting movies from the decade that perfected the summer blockbuster.  Christopher Walken and Louise Fletcher (in one of her finest roles) have perfected a device that records experiences and allows others to relive these experiences as if they are actually happening to them (a plot device that has been so overused now that one has to keep in mind that it was a pretty new concept in 1981).  What follows is a thriller that also passes as a love story (seeing himself through his wife's eyes and experiences, Walken realizes what a selfish husband he has been and undergoes a change).  Of course, the military has other uses for it (essentially blowing things up ... that's what they always want to do in these movies).  And so a game of cat and mouse ensues between the military and the scientists, many spiritual questions are asked and attempts are made to answer them, and a good time is had by the viewing audience.  This movie was directed by Douglas Trumball, who gave us the special effects for Close Encounters and 2001.  On its release, 'Brainstorm' utilized the latest in widescreen technology and therefore was really made to be seen in a state-of-the-art movie theater.  The aspect ratio of the original has been preserved and so the movie goes in and out of widescreen (for times when people are experiencing the recorded sensations) and regular 'boxing.'  I never got to see this on a large screen and regret it, but the disc remains and offers a really terrific movie and a really terrific Louise Fletcher.

B007PVHAN2|5.0|Great documentary about Bob and the friends and family in his life.  I wish the director would have gotten more Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry moments, there were so many that could have been put in this from those recording sessions alone, but a great film nevertheless.<br /><br />I have all of Bob Marley's work, from the dvd's to all records and live work and I am happy to add this to my collection.  This is something that I want to pass down to my kids and let them know, just how important this man was on the world of music, peace and culture!<br /><br />I see some people talking about it was too long, or I wish it were a concert film....go get you a Bob Marley and the Wailers live at the Rainbow DVD and let the rest of us learn more about the man that some of us idolize.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|The Vow is a romance based on real events, in which a married couple are in an accident and the wife loses five years of her memory and doesn't remember meeting, dating, or marrying her husband.  Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams deliver the goods, I don't care what anyone says.  Their characters (Leo and Paige) are utterly believable throughout the movie, and Scott Speedman as Jeremy the ex-fiancee, Jessica Lange as Paige's mother, and Sam Neill as Paige's father definitely add to the story with their convicing characters.  I've seen all the tepid reviews and I'm not sure I get what the problem is.  This is a wonderful story of a man holding true to his vow of life long love, who is also mature enough to sacrifice for the happiness of the woman he loves.  It is also a story of hope, patience, and incredible love.  My only wish is that the ending had given us a bit more, because you are really rooting for Leo, hoping Paige will either remember or will just fall in love with him again, and it would have been great to have a little more to hang your heart on than the last scene (I will not give it away more than that).  I thought Leo's voiceover throughout added to the story, made it more personal and heartwarming, and I thought the frustration, anger, pain, sadness, love, and bittersweet moments were a wonderful emotional landscape to explore.  Don't let the naysayers dissuade you--unless you are really cynical, sarcastic and jaded, or you just don't like romance, I think you'll really enjoy this movie.
1475143389|5.0|I have read most of Michael Matthew's books articles etc. Affordable materials that provide excellent advice if your goal is to gain muscle and/or cut fat. No hype, glossy \\"fabrications\\" provided by \\"well healed\\" supplement sales people. Just simple, honest, advice that works. I don't need endless references to research that may or may not be funded by supplement companies (remember data never lies but liars use data)<br />Try his advice, if it doesn't get you results stop (you're not out much in terms of cash), if you are like me, you will wish you had tried Mike's approach to building muscle many years ago.
030758836X|5.0|I loved book. It was interesting from the very first chapter.  No need to read a long time to establish and remember the characters.  I liked the fact that there were just enough characters, but not so many that you couldn't remember them.  And the characters were well developed.  The mystery and the twists kept your interest going.  And of course the ending was a bit of a surprise.  Good read.  Very good writing.

0545265355|1.0|The first thing I noticed when reading this series is how poorly it is written.  Is the author 10?  It certainly seems like it.  There is no description, everything is in first person which would be fine if Katniss had any insight into anything.  Instead, Collins uses it as an excuse to not flesh out the characters and plot.  You only know what Katniss knows, and she is exceedingly dense.<br /><br />The story itself, while entertaining, lacks in so many ways, often I found my own imagination had to fill in the huge, gaping plot and character holes.  The story arcs are unfinished and read like a first draft.  (Do we not have editors anymore?  Who published this?)  This all then leads up to a huge anti-climax and some cowardly choices by the author when it comes to the plot.<br /><br />As for Katniss herself, she is a terrible character, completely devoid of anything relatable and utterly naive throughout the series.  There is so little growth to her that you would think she stuck her head in the sand the whole time.  She comes off as a pathetic child who lets those around her control her every move - which may have been fine for the first book, but some development might be nice.<br /><br />I read this book, with not much in the way of expectation, however I am most disappointed by the fact that this could have been a really excellent series, had a bit more thought (and maybe a ghost writer) been added.  The story and the characters had so much potential but Collins squandered that with a lack of creativity, will and talent.  What a shame.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Day 2 of playing and it has been fun so far.  The directions are a little thin but nothing that can't be figured out over time.  It would be helpful if you could rotate then screen and zoom in/out further.  Still getting the hang of but a sufficient way to get through off time.

B0086DBE62|2.0|I rarely turn a movie off but I just couldn't even have this playing in the background. What a waste of film, time and talent. Julia Roberts was Julia Roberts as the evil stepmother, not one bit of acting involved. Armie Hammer was pretty to look at but drab as a dishrag. The girl who played Snow White, I didn't even bother to learn her name. I ALWAYS watch a movie through to the end but I couldn't find one thing redeeming about this and I really, really tried. Definitely not a Disney or Pixar movie. What a huge disappointment!

0062011847|3.0|The Watch books have always been my favourite Discworld series, and like its predecessor Thud! this book has Vimes not leading the ensemble, but as the centre of the action. Unlike Thud!, the book is set in the Ramkin family estate, replete with the intentionally generic house staff, village pub and inbred local gentry, with Sam Vimes finally comfortable with being the Squire of the Manor. A murder arises, as the blurb predicts, but on one level that's where Snuff begins to fail.<br /><br />In the majority of watch books Vimes (as proxy for the reader) was dragged along by circumstance, barely keeping one foot in front of the other, let alone ahead of the dastardly adversaries. Snuff is more of a leisurely ramble through subjects of interest, with the reader being presented shyly with concepts and items of interest rather than having the plot thrust them into the reader's hand as it pelts along. Some of the comic set-pieces are typically excellent (watch for the deconstruction of classic romantic literature).<br /><br />Several action scenes are bracingly written (with an extended riverboat chase the centrepiece), but there is rarely a sense of urgency or true risk for Vimes. Even the presence of Sybil and Sam's son fails to excite deep concern on the part of the reader, and even the promise of a genuinely ghastly conspiracy fails to leave you aching to find out WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.<br /><br />Pratchett's favoured themes about class and cultural diversity are revisited again, introducing the deceptively complex \\"barbarian\\" goblins as a new pariah group (to follow on from Golems, Klatchians, Dwarves, Trolls, Orcs and Mime Artists). The goblins do not (however) have strongly defined characters, and feel much more like ciphers for Pratchett's riffing on race and culture. The human characters are well sketched, however, with Constable Upshot an excellent young foil to Vimes' grizzled veteran, and Miss Felicity Beedle the very archetype of the Victorian do-gooder. The effect is somewhat spoiled, however, by brief (and in my view, unnecessary) cameos from the original Watch characters, who do little and have almost no effect on the narrative, feeling more like a tip of the hat to past books than a vital part of the current one.<br /><br />Overall then, this is a disappointment, more of a valentine to Vimes being Vimes rather than a development of his character or an exploration of new themes, settings or stories. Having said that, the lesser works of Pterry generally hold more points of interest than the magnum opus of lesser writers. Recommended, with caveats about setting your expectations too high.

B00004W510|5.0|When this album was released in September of 1969 I had just discovered Jazz and within a year-and-a-half I'd largely stopped listening to the kind of music that would be associated with a teen at the time; a few years later I subsequently discovered classical music.<br /><br />That said, this is still one of the non-Jazz, non-Classical music albums I kept and still cherish.<br /><br />The other thing I like about this album is how well it's recorded; the songs are actually performed \\"live\\" but without an audience, that is they're real ensemble performances that were largely recorded in a performance space rather than just laying down one track at a time; it is my opinion that this brings a very heightened technical element of incredible richness to this album, as good as all the songs and arrangements are.<br /><br />The songs themselves and their arrangements are great; the tunes are all incredibly good and they really are so utterly evocative of time and place all within the context of Americana; this is undoubtedly what makes this album a real joy and also so incredibly powerful.<br /><br />(The one thing I DON'T like about this album is how the vocals are recorded; in \\"those days\\" it was fashionable to have the vocals mixed in at a level similar to the instrumental accompaniment but that was \\"the style\\" at the time; I would have preferred the vocals to be just a little bit more \\"on top.\\")<br /><br />This is a true classic and should be part of any music library that just centers around GOOD MUSIC; get it.
006117758X|5.0|Such a great novel from Charles Bukowski.  I am not an avid reader and I blasted through this book in 3 days! Once I got through the first chapter, it was like I could not stop. Once I had finished, I was online looking to order another novel from Bukowski. This book was not life changing, although I did notice some of myself in the loneliness and desperation of Hank. It is just an easy to read entertaining story, with 3 dimensional characters. A+

0375842209|5.0|I found this book to be enthralling, poignant, and fascinating. I love how, despite how deep the subject matter, the author adds elements of humor throughout. The characters are so well developed that they pull you in and spit you out at the end, feeling as if you've been a part of the story yourself. In my opinion, it's one of those rare books that stays with you forever. I read somewhere about \\"The Book Thief\\".. \\"If you read one book this year, make this the book!\\" and I agree completely.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Good movie like always gots to love johnny depp... The movie was as describe got here pretty fast and love it... Just in time for movie night with my husband... You might want to put the kittys in bed before the movie starts is a good story line but kind of gourry but hey its mr depp you have to like his creppy storys but over all great movie
B005LAIH2W|3.0|I wonder if the scriptwriters bothered reading the novels or just got pieces of ideas here and there. The beginning is totally wrong and many other scenes are invented rather than taken from the novels which, a bit dated, are still fun reads and highly recommended. The movie succeeds best on its CGI elements. The acting is ok nothing extraordinary (ie, typical of the vast majority of today's films) but I must say that Lynn Collins is hardly \\"incomparable\\" (as she's continually described in the novels) as Dejah Thoris. The role could have been better cast. This is one to rent (especially once you've read the novels) and watch once as I doubt you'll care to see it again.

B007V2UGPE|2.0|I actually really loved this game when I downloaded it. I played the heck out of it for like 3 days then suddenly it froze and I had to do a hard shut down on my Kindle Fire to even get out of the game. Then after I booted back up that game wouldn't even load all the way. It goes though the whole load screen and suddenly quits right as the game should start. On top of that none of my other GLU games are working now, all of them refusing to load. I've tried everything I can think of to get them to play be have had no luck. Thank God I didn't spend money on any in game stuff or I'd be really angry.

0061122416|4.0|Believe in yourself. Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist was written and released nearly twenty years before Rhonda Byrne's The Secret.  I mention the latter as it brought about a resurgence of the similar motifs found in The Alchemist: positive thinking and the power of the Universe. Most of us can get our heads around those concepts. In The Alchemist it's very easy for readers to resonate with the central message, i.e., fulfill your destiny and pursue your personal legend. In a sense, most of us are seeking a personal legend not that of Alexander the Great or Charles Darwin, but not necessarily limited in scope either.<br /><br />My wife and I read The Alchemist during the summer knowing the fall would bring major transitions to both of our professional careers. We openly tuned in to the positive themes of the book: acknowledge omens and go out in pursuit of your dreams. I'm reminded of the Stephen King and John Mellencamp collaborative project, The Ghost Brothers of Darkland County. This piece offers a raw look at what happens if you wait too late to do the things your soul tugs at you to do.<br /><br />The Alchemist begins like an epic. The reader can reflect through the Shepherd on his/her own journey of self-discovery. However, I found the story's ending came too quickly and too easily. For me, it seemed a bit forced and contrived. That's why I lowered my rating.  Rapidity of the ending aside, Coelho's crafting of the Shepherd gave him a real sense of wonder. If the character stayed true to that, perhaps the close of Natalie Merchant's Cowboy Romance offers a more fitting conclusion:<br />As he grows sober<br />Sees his love anew<br />In the morning light so true<br />He gets on the move...
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|If you want to watch this movie at home you definitely have to get it on Blu-Ray.  The actors, light bikes and ships pop out a little bit even with 2-D blu-ray.  The movie may not have THE best story out there, but it works.  And because of the movie's awesome looks on blu-ray, along with the amazing score by Daft Punk, it's just a blast to watch.
0670921076|5.0|The interesting, well-written and researched true story of an English girl who was murdered in Peking just before the start of World War II. The author examines the possibilities and presents a probable solution.  Good reading.
B00003CXCT|3.0|First off, the movies do look good.  Of course now the blu-rays look better, but these are good-looking DVDs.  The movies are unfortunately not the theatrical versions that we all know and love.  Star Wars (A New Hope) has the CGI Jabba scene which I thought was totally unnecessary, AND the scene where Greedo shoots first.  That scene looks VERY BAD in this DVD.  As far as Empire Strikes Back, I wasn't that upset with too much, the only noticeable change for me was adding in Ian McDiarmid to act as the hologram emperor (a change I like).  Finally, Return of the Jedi adds in some \\"cool\\" things towards the end of the movie, where it shows people celebrating the end of the empire on Coruscant and Naboo.  And we get to see Hayden Christensen as Anakin's ghost at the end... YAY.  If you want to see the original versions watch them on vhs, that's what I do (there are also the limited edition DVDs with the theatrical laserdisc non-anamorphic transfers on it which apparently look similar to vhs quality anyway).  If for some reason you like the special edition add-ons plus these new DVD release updates (everyone has their own opinions) then this is a good set if you can get it used at a good price.  Better yet, if you want to hear Darth Vader say \\"NO... NOOOOOOOOO\\" then just buy the blu-ray set.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|The sequel to Book One, this plot literally picks up where the other left off; therefore, reading Book Two without Book One would be problematic.  As in the first book, James overuses descriptive phrases rather than expanding word choice and sentence variety.  The plot becomes a bit more believable but still relies much too heavily on sexual content, which suggests that the two lead characters cannot be in one another's presence without having some form of sexual contact.  In this aspect, it is overdone and ridiculously redundant, and the \\"mercurial\\" moods of Christian can give a reader whiplash.  Otherwise, the writing flows well and generally maintains the readers' interest.  I enjoyed Book Two and the deliberate move away from some of the more bizarre practices of Book One.
0425263908|1.0|First Kindle Book Review EVER, I just Had to !!<br />So I stumbled upon this book after reading Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, I wondered to myself another book like it why not ? I was so wrong not what I expected at all !! I was so confused that I wondered to myself if my kindle had skipped pages !! Its not as deep as 50 Shades, (Spoiler ALERT) .... The characters in this book barely speak all they do is have sex and while im all for sex I feel that thats all that happens in this book, I never find out what was wrong with Gideon (Main Male Character) nor do I want to, I felt mad at myself for wasting my time reading this book. I had hopes of it getting somewhere but my hopes were crushed. Seriously anything can end up on the New York Times Best Seller List
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Perhaps, there was just too much hype on this book.  I bought it based on the media coverage of the supposed female \\"frenzy\\" over it. James appears to be writing for the singular purpose of describing deviant sex acts and succeeds brilliantly with that aspect, but at the expense of furthering the plot, which could be summed up in a paragraph. The book lives up to the erotica but the author's descriptions become repetitive enough to become bothersome, at times.  Phrases such as \\"familiar ache,\\" \\"rolled her eyes,\\" pressed his lips in a thin, hard line,\\" and \\"bit her lip\\" occur much too often.  The story ends abruptly in a cliffhanger, without any substantive foreshadowing, therefore, leaving the reader unsatisfied or annoyed.  I did enjoy the book, but the author could have made it much better by expanding word choice, deepening the story line, and varying descriptive passages.  However, if someone is looking for soft, aberrant sexual content, this book fits the bill.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|title says it all. it's well worth a free download. as others have said, it starts off quite easy and gets challenging quickly.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is good in an odd way.  I'm language sensitive about the \\"F\\" word but I couldn't stop reading it. I am now reading book 2 and think it is  good. I want to read all three books.  I have to find out the reason he is like he is..
034580404X|5.0|This was a git and arrived earlier than expected which was great and helpful. it was shrik wrapped as well
0345803485|4.0|I had heard so much talk about this book but I wasn't sure I wanted to jump on the bandwagon to read it.  But while we were in Hilton Head, my mom and I were talking about it and we both decided to go that night and buy the first book.  And I'm so glad that we did.<br /><br />I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed the book.  While I've never reviewed them, I've read some erotica before and they were always just kind of \\"ehh\\" for me and I thought this would be the same.  But I think that this book was a well put-together combination of sex and story.<br /><br />That doesn't mean that I didn't have a HUGE problem with Christian Grey though.  I get that part of it is from the Dom culture but he was over the top controlling.  And the stalking freaked me out  To me, this all screamed \\"ABUSIVE\\"!  And I was never okay wit it.  But I'm glad that Ana was never really okay with it either.  That made it a little more real that she was okay with the pleasure part but not the pain part.<br /><br />I really liked Ana.  I thought she was strong yet vulnerable at the same time.  She fell strongly for this guy but realized how wrong the relationship was.  And the constant commentary from her subconcious and her inner goddess cracked me up.<br /><br />I find myself sad that I have other blog tour books to read because I have the next two books in the trilogy sitting here waiting for me to dive in to.  My new guilty pleasure.  Oh.  And I have no idea how they would make this into a movie unless it would be 18 & over only!

B007XNAOS0|5.0|Baroness' new album \\"Yellow and Green\\" is a masterful album with great musicianship. This album will divide fans that weren't ready for such a transition. This reminded me of some of the routes bands like Mastodon or Opeth have taken. This album will be misunderstood and overlooked by the metal community. However, if you appreciate beautiful melodies and outstanding musicianship, I say that this album is more than worth your time. I think this is one of the better releases of 2012.

B004FUZLYG|1.0|I adore Tharaud's recording of the Chopin Waltzes.  That CD has been on my disc-changer for years now, and I was looking forward to this CD of Scarlatti since I saw an advertisement for it in a classical music magazine.  Unfortunately, I was more than underwhelmed by Tharaud's approach to this Baroque master.  His piano sound is extremely percussive and assaultive to my ear.  I had to turn down the volume repeatedly. I didn't want to listen twice to any of his interpretations.  I had hoped this disc would go next to my beloved Scarlatti collections by Schiff, Pogorelich, Tipo, Horowitz, and Babayan.  I was disappointed that so little of the nuance and mastery of Tharaud's Chopin playing came through in his Scarlatti interpretations.  These harpsichord pieces sound like they don't belong on the piano when Tharaud plays them----obviously not true, as you can see from my list of five masters who have recorded them superlatively.  Scarlatti doesn't need to sound like vapid technical studies played too fast and with distortedly unsubtle and in-your-face articulations.  I was really surprised. I really wanted to love this recording. But Tharaud is not an interpreter of Baroque music (including Couperin) that I can listen to.
B000K7J9G4|1.0|Why is the fourth episode not available? There is no point having any of the episodes if you don't have them all. It's bad enough that only Episodes 1, 3, and 5 are available for prime but Episode 2 costs $2. I can understand having the first episode free and requiring a purchase for the others, but at least make it possible to view the whole series. Badly done, Amazon. Badly done, indeed.
B007HJ91HU|1.0|I purchaced this movie and another one to watch on a plane ride. After purchacing, I downloaded it to my Fire, as directed. Next day got on my plane and could not watch it.

B0034G4P94|4.0|Ok, First I want to say it is not really \\"Rocky\\" but from a guy who has every Rocky movie and loved them all, this is another great. It has a completely different feel, don't see bulging muscles and long drawen out training scenes. Perhaps it is more of a drama?<br />I guess the family perspective is really done well, people with troubles yet committed to something and or someone. Well worth the time and purchase.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found myself picking a \\"team\\" and then second guessing it.  Flynn really builds interesting characters.  I wasn't happy about the ending.  I kept looking for the next page, but after sitting back and thinking about it, it was the best way to end the book.  I have recommended this book to others, but still like Dark Places better.
B005NFYXTG|2.0|Which was more disgusting to watch?  \\"Bloodsucking Freaks,\\" which, I believe was made about 1976.  \\"The Human Centipede,\\" made in the last few years.  Or \\"Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom,\\" made in 1975.<br /><br />Of the three, \\"Salo\\" has the most classical lineage: based on the writings of the Marquis de Sade, the filmmakers have moved the action to 1944 Italy under the fascists...and what a sick collection of fascists they are.  One looks like a demonic version of Father Murphy.  Another is a cross-eyed freak who may have out-creeped the toothless hillbillies in \\"Deliverance.\\"<br /><br />I'm going to cut straight to the chase here, folks: Father Murphy performs a bowel movement on a hardwood floor and forces a naked young teen girl to eat it.  You probably saw the title and thought, \\"Ooh, de Sade.  Kinky.\\"  No.  If you've ever taken a peek at the marquis' writings, he's way beyond kinky.  The violence is perverted but also grotesque (there's nothing \\"kinky\\" about watching a young girl being scalped), the degradation doesn't end with one girl forced to eat excrement: an entire meal of it is served later to everyone.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, classically edited...but disgusting and ultimately pointless by the \\"end.\\"  It doesn't even really end.  It just stops.<br /><br />Wow.
B006RUJST6|5.0|if you are tired of just reading college books and need to shake things up a bit, this book will do it!

B006P0FD4W|3.0|There appears to be either a love or hate reaction to the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films.  They're very low-key, minimalist supernatural stories that manage to use their limitations to bring about some effective chills.<br /><br />I've watched hours after hours of full-blown, stomach-churning gorefests that couldn't pull off one of the genuine eerie chills I got from watching the security cameras in the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY films.<br /><br />They're creating a reality where something sinister is growing off-camera, in our closets, down the hall--places we know very well.  A light turning on and off on the other side of the house fills us with dread since we know no one is there.  And, for the third time, I was pulled into this experience.<br /><br />The problem I had this time was that it wasn't entirely clear just what was down the hall.  Although that was intentional for the purposes of the story (it is resolved, at least partially, by the end), I didn't get the same feeling of knowing that a demon was loose in these people's lives.  The trailer showed the little girls summoning a ghost via the \\"Bloody Mary\\" campfire tale of repeating her name in a dark room three times.  This scene doesn't appear in the film.  What does appear in the film is one of the little girls chanting it with an adult--but since there's clearly something already in the house, it doesn't really fit.<br /><br />But there are still some very cool scenes, especially involving a rotating camera that slowly scans back and forth.  My favorite involved the babysitter.<br /><br />There will be a 4th entry and the trailer was recently released picking up the story with Katie and Hunter now haunting a pretty young neighbor.  We're back in the present for the next one and I'm sure I'll see it, interested to see where they go with this.<br /><br />I'd like to see one where someone reacts to all of this paranormal activity going on in all of these home movies!
B0037VNX44|3.0|Acting was fantastic.  But the character of the protagonist was so gross that there was nothing you could do with the movie to make it likeable.  A totally empty individual who loved pain and loved to inflict pain and never redeams himself is worthless.  The warden that appears at the end of the movie knew what and who he was dealing with.  He did a great job in the short amount of time to tag Charlie. I liked it well enough to stick through it, unfortunately I thought he might gain insight into why he created his own chaos.  He didn't, nor did he try.  Sad through and through.

B007NVJ7NU|4.0|Gaspar Noe is one of the best foreign filmmakers of the 21st century. This film is one of the most ingenius films for storyline and camerawork, not to mention the performances by the actors. A definite must see for film lovers. It is a definite one of a kind. The film basically deals with a young man's death and his after death journey between his death and rebirth. This film is way more toned down than Noe's previous films, especially Irreversable. I consider Irreversable probably my favorite French film of all time. The film does have adult themes such as violence and sex and drug use, but nowhere as near as Irreversable. I really wish that Gaspar would make more films. Because he is a one of a kind director, and judging by the 4 films he has done there is no other filmmaker out there like him.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|My review is not going to compare this movie to other movies'\\"merits\\" simply because in the last 30 years I have only watched around five movies and was always unable to detect merits in any of them. After each time wasted in such a manner, I've always been determined to never watch any movie again. Sadly, I fell for the Hollywood machination of promoting this useless little exercise, but luckily without any expense incurred - I borrowed it from a library.<br />An Oscar I have finally come to realize is actually a prize that the industry gives itself as a last resort to salvage a movie that is so unusually bad, that it cannot survive commercially without a major effort at a publicity campaign such as an Oscar. It is impossible to enumerate all the bad excesses of this movie and more importantly an actual waste of time equal to that of watching this movie, so I will just list the 2 most important ones:<br /><br />Nathalie Portman, who in her gushy Oscar speech, called her part \\"a gift\\", shows minimal acting skills;I got thoroughly tired of her use of 1.5 facial expressions apparently deemed appropriate for this oeuvre(\\"the tortured one\\",and \\"the crazed one\\"). It was also tiring to watch the ballet routines from constantly the same angle: sideways for a group performance, and center, for the \\"passionate\\" swirling of Nathalie.<br /><br />The plot is a pure Hollywood \\"magic\\" recipe, based on their old theory that most of the people are stupid most of the time. Just give the masses what is currently a \\"daring\\" buzz, such as lesbianism, masturbation, self mutilation, etc., ad nauseum, promote it without letup until a public hysteria is generated, and then laugh all the way to the bank.
B006Z00M9I|4.0|I liked this part of the trilogy best. The last 15 minutes is astounding. If you are a fan of the other two films I think you will like this part.

B0048LPRD2|4.0|The film is about a guy who is killed and his souls journey through the afterlife. A genius of a film like the rest of Gaspar Noe's films which is one of my favorite directors. The film really has a strong influence of The Tibetian book of the dead. A must see for Noe fans. It is a one of a kind.

0805095535|4.0|You pick up memoir such as this one expecting...what? A life laid out chronologically? The failures of parenting - yours and that of your parents? Confessions and dirty linen? The titillation of romantic escapades? Saucy comments about other writers, editors, or reviewers? The summation of a life lived well or poorly?<br /><br />Auster gives you some of that, but what stands out to you is the writing: the fluid, run-on style in which sentences can last half a page, paragraphs that go on interminably, but without boring, without allowing your mind to wander, making use of the first person tool of \\"you\\" instead of the usual \\"I,\\"which has that distancing feeling that a memoir deserves. A style with an affinity for lists (places he's lived, sweets he's eaten), a running rivulet of emotions regarding family, lovers, places he's been, people - good and bad - he's been related to or otherwise known.<br /><br />Somehow you expect such a memoir to rise slowly as the author encounters life's crises and victories, you expect it to end as fiction does, with crisis point and denouement, but that's not at all what Auster gives you. In places he does just that, though, but in the broader perspective he gives you things as he encounters them in memory, following their sixty-plus years.<br /><br />Does he give you any reason to doubt this work's veracity, to say to yourself, \\"Bullshit, he's gilding the lilly there?\\" Only over one subject do you cock an eyebrow in such a manner: his constantly interspersed romantic conquests. Yet even here he doesn't dwell on them, he depicts them on the run, all part of the stream of life coughing its way over its now smooth-worn rocks, until, finally, the ice begins to gather, the ice of - as he tells you on the last page, \\"the winter of your life,\\" in which you see - with him - the sense of an American life's hubbub.<br /><br />As memoirs go, it's one you're glad you've read.

B005LAII08|5.0|See this movie; buy this movie!  It is enchanting, funny and has a good storyline and moral.  How often these days can you take an 11-year-old boy, 5-year old girl, your parents and your husband to the same movie and have everyone satisfied with it?  In my estimation, this movie is well worth the price as we are all looking forward to seeing it many more times.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|So much comes together in book three! Couldn't put it down. I read hundreds of pages at a time.  This book is much faster-paced than the first two, now that we know all of the characters.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I requested this book for netgalley without reading the summary. I had just seen that a lot of people really loved this book, so I thought I should read it. Well, this normally is not the type of book I would enjoy. There was violence, sex scenes, cussing, all of which I do not appreciate in a book. However, this book was so good that it made all of that worth it. I probably would not let a young teen read this book, but it's great for older people I think.<br /><br />The love Travis had for Abby was almost mind-blowing. They went through so much and their fights were like all out wars. There love surpassed it all though. They would not give up on each other. Travis changed his lifestyle completely just for Abby. That was sweet to see. It was kind of annoying how they loved each other one second, and hated each other the next. However, I think it was perfect for the story. They were both such passionate people that they fought or loved with that same passion.<br /><br />This book had me completely absorbed after the first chapter. I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />I received this book for free in return for an honest review.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love this app! A lot more than what I expected from a free app. There are different levels of difficulty which is great for newer players like myself. You can make it more difficult as you progress which is great so you never get bored because of it being too easy. Great job!
B0000931QA|5.0|\\"Operation Mindcrime\\" is the third full length release from Queensryche.  It is a concept album based on a man named Nikki who is brainwashed to be an assassin for Dr. X.  For an album, it is a rather complex but interesting story.  Geoff Tate's vocals are still top notch and I consider this to be their second to last album before the band went into decline.  To keep the story line flowing there are bits and pieces of dialogue such as at the beginning of the album and many of the other songs as well.  The dialogue only adds to the strength of this album.  The music is well written and catchy.  The style is typically mid-paced and heavy.  It isn't as intense as Queennsryche's first EP and \\"The Warning\\" nor is it as light as \\"Empire.\\"  While the guitar players aren't typically \\"shredders\\" the solos and the rhythms are written in a more catchy nature.  I consider this to be one of the best concept albums to come out of the 80s, as there weren't too many heavy metal concept albums out yet.  As for best songs, \\"The Mission\\" is a great song which starts of with slow guitar and picks up pace in the middle.  \\"I don't believe in Love\\" is a catch mid-paced song with some awesome sounding bass.  I used to play this song when i was going through a break up (even though the concept wasn't about a break up).  \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" is an epic track with an eerie feel to it.  There are many changes of pace during this song.  If you like 80s metal with clean vocals and a good story line, you may like this album.    [...]
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Definitely perform the calibration procedure. I like to use my KF as a music source by plugging into my home audio setup. This app has been helpful in that I can know at a glance just how long I can leave it playing without a recharge (I have my charger in one of those cord hider things, not in the same room).<br /><br />This is the best app I have used so far, KF users will be quite surprised at the information it provides.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|Love this game!  Since downloading the full version I haven't had any problems. Now I did with the free version but not with this.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Any movie that Anthony Hopkins is in is great. Add in Ryan Gosling and you have the nucleus of an outstanding movie. This movie did not disappoint at all. Great plot and interesting twists along the way made this a sure fire winner. Runs steady start to finish. It had a very satisfying ending also. I watched the film the way it was in its original form and did not play either of the 2 alternate ending as I thought the one they chose was good. You really can't go wrong watching this movie.
0385344228|4.0|This was a quick, great summer read. I found myself having a hard time putting it down. However as the mother of a 14 year old boy I was incredibly disturbed by many aspects of the plot. The ending left me breathless. It was quite unexpected and in fact I had nightmare for the following 2 nights! Very suspensful, full of surprises and well written.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Updated and it uninstalled the old version and wiped the app data losing level progress.  Force closed when trying to restore data to the app.  Jellybean 4.1.1
B001NLKT60|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It kept  my interest and was difficult to put down.  The author really spent some time building these characters and it all seemed to work well.  I especially like the main character, Lisbeth.  She brings to focus a very capable and intelligent person with likely a fascinating disability.  I highly recommend this book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this when I was 11 or 12, and it brought me into the amazing worlds that spin out from Orson Scott Card. Sheer brilliance. I hope they do eventually make the movie - it has been talked about since the book hit the charts.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I could play this game all day long that's how fun this game is and this game is fun for everyone even my grandma would like it
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The beginning was very interesting but I soon found out that it was more for older audiences! Always read the reviews before buying!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I admit I got caught up in the frenzy and thankfully only had to borrow it from the library.  I don't understand what the fuss is about.  The book is without plot or storyline.  The female character is silly, naive and constantly questioning her decisions and those of others. I don't believe she was capable of the simplest task. I didn't complete it feeling that it was a waste of my time.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I wouldn't want these guys coming after me.  A good story of courage, dedication, honor, and true warrior spirit.  These are the type of men our country can truly be proud of.
B0063IH60K|5.0|omg this solitaire game is so addictive, no wonder i don't get enough sleep anymore. and i always have something to fun in my morning or evening commute.
0345803485|5.0|I read this series because everyone was talking about it and I just had to see what the fuss was all about. I really enjoyed the series, but honestly, now that I've read some other \\"similar\\" books, I think that it could have been written a little better. Don't get me wrong, it's extremely entertaining and I loved Christian and Ana and the story line, but like many others have pointed out, it's repetative. I would still recommend the book if you're looking for a great love story, with many highs and lows.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|This product is not worth for money and you will find other products with better quality for less cost than this. Even the return policy is very bad for this product. Worst part is You need to pay $7 for shipping if you had to return this product. Where as if you are going to return Kindle Fire, you need to pay $3 for shipping.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app was recommended at church.  I tried it and couldn't be happier.  I love the multiple translations available and the ability to download translations to my kindle to read when I don't have Internet access.
B001KQEE0U|1.0|I purchased All Eyez On Me from Amazon.  I had no problems downloading it to Amazon Cloud Player, but only one disc would upload to my I-tunes.  My only consolation is that I only paid $2.99 for the album, this is the only time I have had this problem using Amazon.  It makes me very leery of purchasing MP3s from Amazon.
B004PR71JC|5.0|Just as the title says . My children n I love the rhythm n feel of this music and it arrived right on time.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Wow, this book takes hold right from the start and doesn`t let go.  Can`t wait for Anthony Ryan`s next adventure.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very nice app. comes in handy when I'm balancing my check book. will keep using this app for a very long time.
030758836X|3.0|This was a great read. Definitely a page turner-couldn't put it down type of book. However, the ending was absolutely horrible.
0441020712|3.0|I will preface this by saying that I am a huge Alastair Reynolds fan. I have almost read every book he has on the market, including the collection of his short stories. That being said, while Blue Remembers Earth is a solid book, it falls short in several areas, and nothing much really happens in it.<br /><br />Blue follows the path of Geoffrey and Sunday Akinya, two siblings from an ultra-rich spare-faring family. Shortly after their grandmother Eunice dies, they embark on a quest to follow a series of clues that the isolated woman left behind. Along the way to a universe changing secret, they encounter several competing factions, vengeful cousins, artificial intelligences, and a lethal space station. It sounds exciting, but Blue Remembers Earth never quite rises above a level of \\"Mildly Stimulating.\\" The characters can be annoying at times. In particular, Geoffrey seems to get offended very easily, and hurls unwarranted verbal (and at one point, physical) violence towards his cousins. The cousins, Hector and Lucas Akinya, get yelled at by Geoffrey for merely visiting him, or existing. It gets tiring. Other than that large flaw, both of the main characters were likeable, if a bit spoiled. At least the characters themselves explore several of the flaws that make them annoying. The biggest problem that I had with this book was that despite traveling all over our solar system, nothing much happens. I mean, stuff does happen, but it isn't ever awe-inspiring. The book builds and builds and builds, but the payoff at the end is weak and unexciting. I hope future books get a bit more interesting, or I probably won't bother to finish the series.<br /><br />Oh, I tried to block this out of my memory, but I guess I need to talk about it in a review: Geoffrey has a thing for elephants. That is THE most annoying thing about him. I wish the elephants had been left out entirely.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Yes, it's that good. It's sometimes funny, often gritty, and always compelling. It's the TV version of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. I usually wait until a few episodes queue up on my DVR so I can watch them all at once, because at the end of every show I can't wait to see what happens next. Some of the supporting performances are a bit thin, but they don't detract from Cranston's and Paul's incredible talent.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|Sweet mellow story. Will relax you, make you think about how amazing our bird world is and how annoying our human world can be. It's a tug at your heartstrings kind of movie. You will smile at the end and be thankful for watching. For the reviewers who didn't like it - go find another planet !
B0064SHI9I|5.0|I installed MyBackup Pro (by RerWare) on my Droid 3 yesterday, put it through its paces, and it passed every test with flying colors. A few observations:<br /><br />1) When I signed up, for some reason RerWare's site rejected my email address. I went to the \\"Contact Us\\" page, sent a snapshot of the error message, and asked what to do. I received a response within 15 minutes, telling me that the system didn't like the hyphen (-) in my address, and suggesting that I try a different address without a hyphen. It worked.<br /><br />2) For my first experiment, I backed up ONLY my apps - but even this exceeded the default storage space. That truncated the backup and sent me to the RerWare site to purchase more space. At 1 GB for $10/yr, it's a bit pricey, but no complaint considering the importance to me of being able to back up quickly and conveniently. Prospective users should purchase more space before beginning a backup, and perhaps consider backing up photos and media to a PC.<br /><br />3) I then had to restart my backup from the beginning. I couldn't find any instructions for deleting the initial truncated archive, so I sent another message asking how to do this, and received and SECOND answer within 15 minutes!<br /><br />This app is very cleverly designed with respect to both user interface and workflow. Although I didn't attempt a restore, it performed flawlessly otherwise, and I could see my files in the online archive. And speaking of convenience, when's the last time you asked a technical question at a \\"Contact Us\\" page and received a response in 15 minutes?
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Craig Johnson makes it fun to read and the story is great.  A fun summer book for those hot days.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Fantastic book, I can't wait for the next one! The Author managed to suck me in on page 1. I was completely unwilling to put this book down.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I've had a few FM transmitter's in the past but the Soundfly AUX MP3 Player Transmitter is so far the best I've owned yet. No other frequencies have interrupted the transmitter yet and it's very easy to use.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|This book was fast-paced just like the others however I was disapointed for multiple reasons.<br /><br />One of the reasons were all the quistions that the first two books made me think of, they were not all answered, and I don't mean just a few quistions werent answered, I mean just about all of them werent answered.<br /><br />My other reason was at the end, someone died who didn't need to die at all, I think if you have read the book, you know exactly who I am talking about. I will not spoil the name just incase there are people reading this who have not read The Death Cure. I don't think the way he/she died was worthy enough to new to his/her standards. The death was so simple and instantaneous, there was a severe lack of emotion.<br /><br />Overall these are the only reasons i was not fully satisfied with this book. I have just preordered The Kill Order, and will start reading on the midnight kindle release on August 14 th. hopefully it will answer the questions that are still lurking in my head. Maybe James didn't answer them for a reason.<br /><br />Overall, decent read, still worth reading if you have read the other two books in this trilogy.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Everyone knows that Slash is one of the top rock guitarists of all time and he sounds great on this record.  No surprise.  Myles Kennedy is exactly the right singer to take Slash's riffs and transform them into great songs that get stuck in your head and keep you singing them.  If you haven't ever checked out Myles, do yourself a favor and jump on the bandwagon, he's sooo good.  The thing I liked best about this collaboration is that it's true to hard rock roots of the 80's but also seems current and relevant.  I love it!  Favorite tracks Anastasia & the title track.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am only 16 years old and when I started reading this book, I imeadiatly noticed the vocabulary in this book is far above what I'm used to reading (but that does not make me an illiterate child), luckily I was reading it on the kindle to help me understand words that I did not know.<br /><br />As I got further into the book, I started looking at more reviews of the book. While reading reveiws, I learned that the first season in the tv series ended and was going to be released onto DVD and blu-ray. I purchased the DVD set right away, I don't remember what the price was, but I remember it was kind of spendy for my budget, I think somewhere around $30-40. Anyways,I'm getting kind of off-topic, I was using both the kindle and the DVD set to help me understand the world that G.R.R. Martin created.<br /><br />Anyways now to my opinion of the story. I see that this author has no problem getting rid if his main characters. After reading that my favorite character of the Stark family died, I was shocked, and from that point on I hated the person who killed him, considering he shouldn't have even had the power to do so. He stole his spot in the throne and convicted my favorite character of Treason.<br /><br />Another one of my opinions of this story is that I picked to read this book at a young age. Its kind of different reading books that contain sex. All the books I have read have contained little to no sexual scenes, I can't even count how many we're in the book. I even had a very awkward moment while watching the TV series on DVD. On one of the sex scenes my parents walked in and thought I was watching a porno, I had to explain to them that its a TV series of the book that I'm reading and it was probably one of the most awkward comversations Ive ever had with my parents. Anyways, im getting off subject again.<br /><br />What really disturbed me about this book, was that there is incest in it, and I'm sure it's clear who I'm talking about. I would have never expected this, especially from a family of such royalty.<br /><br />Really I could go on and on about the hundreds of great moments in this book, but unfortunately amazon has restrictions on how long a review can be.<br /><br />Overall I would have to say that this IS the best book I have ever read, there is so much originality in this book, that what happens next is completely unpredictable. However, I would like to ask the fans of this if they think i should read the second book in this series, because I'm not sure what exactly could be in the second book, but if it's any more disturbing then incest, I'm not sure if I want to read it. If you have read the second book please let me know by posting a comment to this reveiw.<br /><br />And for those of you who have not read this book, please let me know if my reveiw has helped., especially from a family of such royalty.<br /><br />Really I could go on and on about the hundreds of great moments in this book, but unfortunately amazon has restrictions on how long a review can be.<br /><br />Overall I would have to say that this IS the best book I have ever read, there is so much originality in this book, that what happens next is completely unpredictable.

B0054JZC6E|1.0|I have had some problems with my kindle so I had a protection app downloaded. Its a free app called Dr. Webb. So far it is working well. When I went to download this app it had told me that this app had threats and so I deleted it so watch out.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I must say this was a good book, but I was slightly disappointed, but I'll get to that later. The book was fast-paced but lengthy at the same time.<br /><br />There was defiantly a lot more character development going on in this book then I thought there was going to be, which is good because I love learning about the world James Dashner brought me into.<br /><br />This book kind of reminds me of zombie appocolypse related novels, I'm not sure if James was trying to make the newly introduced creatures appear like zombies in my mind, but either way, I like that thought.<br /><br />Now to why I was slightly disapointed; in James Dashners first book in this trilogy, The Maze Runner, he introduced to a world known as the Glade. I was sad to see that it was not in this book at all.<br /><br />Overall great book.
0425263908|5.0|I really loved 50 shades of Gray.  I was having major withdrawal.  I found this book, and couldn't wait to read it.  I liked it alot better than 50.  Personally, there was too much sex in 50.  This one has plenty, but a better story.  I have recommended it to many of my 50 shade lovers.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I was actually recommended this book by a friend so I grabbed it from my local library. As soon as I started reading, I couldnt stop, and I mean literally; I stayed up all night just to finish it.<br /><br />The plot has quite a bit of originality that I don't see in many books. I liked this book do much, when I got my kindle 4 months after I read it, I purchased it to reread it on my kindle.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this book was my lack of being able to visualize the Grievers but I blame this on my own lack of imagination.<br /><br />Overall great fast-paced read.

B005IQZB14|5.0|I love this book. I just couldn't put this book down. It is a great story. It made me laugh and cry.
B007H9B6KA|5.0|This is a very unexpected surprise indeed! Butch Vig and company returned with a powerful offering. The listener is thrown back to authentic Alternative music. Something that is sorely missed in todays world. This takes a darker turn from Bleed Like Me-already tragic. I honestly thought that was the last we'd ever hear from this band. I had the pleasure of seeing them open for Smashing Pumpkins in the late 90s.<br /><br />The tracks are hard and drum driven by Mr. Vigs drums. Control is vintage craftsmanship. It hails back to the first album. It is perfect in all aspects. Felt revives a lost genre that shouldnt be missed. Sugar and the Battle In Me round out the best tracks. I Hate Love is high energy post electronica, yet the bitter message is often addressed by Miss Manson. Its funny how I wanna get up and dance to this sublime track. Overall this dark wonder is an instant classic.<br /><br />The most peculiar thing I have noticed about Garbages last three albums is the producer-Billy Bush, yes that creepy sensational reality star reporter is the producer, like Butch Vig needs his help. At no time do I notice his influence. He seems more like a creepy informant for Clear Channel, who would never play Garbage in the first place. So why is his name on Garbages work?<br /><br />It all makes sense when I listen to Not Your Kind Of People. This is obviously dedicated to him and his phony production. Its rather humorous, and hopefully he and his entire Mickey Mouse operation finally get the message. Leave the real artists alone! Hopefully this will identify the emperors NEW clothes. Sure, you can shut down the record companies(they will go independent), filter whats on the radio(we will just turn it off). Art and the counter culture cannot be silenced, thankfully.<br /><br />This is a message to the next generation-put down your comic books, smart phones, snacks, lady gaga and that beiber kids rubbish and listen to Garbage. Agst can lead to burnt calories and the \\"edge\\"your generation is lacking. Yes, you too are really a Beloved Freak at heart.

B00127RAJY|1.0|This was the first Jillian Michaels exercise DVD I'd bought--and it will likely be my last. The routine itself is very doable, although, I have my doubts about girl one being a beginner and girl two being an expert. Both girls are fit as a fiddle and if you're just starting out, these gals will by far out jump you. If you're looking to feel the workout, you will, and if you're looking for something with fairly simple moves, this is. However, there is a lot of jumping and repetition... it almost gets a little boring. This alone is good or bad depending on where you live and how you like to exercise.<br /><br />The thing that utterly irritated me to no end is that each time you watch the DVD, you are FORCED to watch: 1) the \\"don't steal our DVD\\" warnings 2) health risks warning 3) Biggest Loser DVD ad (not short) 4) intro to what the exercise routines are about. These, in total, add many wasted minutes to your morning. And if you're hoping for a quick routine to exercise and go, this one will bog you down. Personally, this was a deal breaker for me. Jillian is off my list of exercise DVDs.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|Watson and Holmes ate at it once more and the game is afoot.  Do not think of this as a sequel to the 2009 movie or relating to the books. It is more of a tongue-n-cheek Bond with lots of action. Moriarty is his own megalomaniac self. We get to travel all over Europe in 1891 or a reasonable facsimile.<br /><br />The year is 1891. France and Germany are at each other's throats. There is a series of bombings. Most people pin it on anarchists. But Holmes has a different theory; we know what that theory is. We get to go along as Holmes proves his theory. What about Dr. Watson? Well it seems he's getting married. Will this throw a wrench into the works? And how can the new Mrs. Watson felt the Sherlock's brother is fond of her?<br /><br />of the new Mrs. Watson<br />? One thing I appreciate in movies is placing the names of the actors/characters next to their picture so we are sure who they are.

B005MMJ84K|5.0|This has been a fun series. I hope there is more. The author did leave a tag at the end that makes it feel like we aren't finished. I don't want to give any spoilers.<br /><br />By now, Lena has become very real to me. So has this world she runs in. It is a scary world that keeps me in suspense, will she live? If she does what is there for her? I put down my Kindle feeling anxious and out of breath. Most of all, I hope our world never turns the corner that makes it become Lena's world.<br /><br />I have now become a fan of Lauren Oliver and look forward to reading more of her books.
0553801473|4.0|Yes, it's been a long wait. To tell the truth, it's been a very long wait. A wait that has spawned Grrrumblers and haters, a wait that saw a lot of mud thrown the author's way. A wait that has raised expectations to a level that is a little bit scary, if you ask me. A wait that's been made much more difficult given the fact that the latest volume, A Feast for Crows, wasn't received as well as its predecessors.<br /><br />Hence, the questions on everyone's lips are: Will A Dance With Dragons be worth the wait, and can the book possibly live up to the lofty expectations this interminable wait generated. Well, it is with great pleasure that I answer yes on both counts! The fifth installment in the A Song of Ice and Fire sequence delivers on basically all fronts. It's everything fans wanted it to be and then some! A Dance With Dragons isn't perfect, mind you. But it should silence George R. R. Martin's harshest detractors and demonstrate once again that, when he is writing at the top of his game, very few SFF authors, past or present, can spin a yarn the way GRRM can!<br /><br />Here's the blurb:<br /><br />In the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance--beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.<br /><br />Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys's claim to Westeros forever.<br /><br />Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone--a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.<br /><br />From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.<br /><br />The worldbuilding has always been one of my favorite aspects of this series. Granted, GRRM keeps his cards pretty close to his chest in that regard, and has been doing so since the very first volume. Hence, the tantalizing glimpses he offers us from time to time add new depth to an already convoluted overall story arc and multilayered plotlines that form the backdrop of the entire series. This time around, we finally learn more about the Doom of Valyria. More background information about the land beyond the Wall, the Free Cities, Slaver's Bay, and Westeros' past is unveiled in various POV sections of the book. I particularly enjoyed Sir Barristan Selmy's POV section. Having served a number of kings as a member of the Kingsguard, the knight offers an interesting perspective regarding the events which led to the current conflicts on both sides of the Narrow Sea.<br /><br />Many feel that A Feast for Crows' biggest failing was the tight focus of the narrative on a limited number of story arcs. For better or worse, Martin and his editors elected to concentrate on the events occurring in and around King's Landing, the Iron Islands, as well as Dorne. Many felt that this tight focus prevented the novel from being as epic as its predecessors. Which, I would have to agree, is true. On the other hand, A Dance With Dragons is a sprawling monster of a book. The action takes place ina panoply of countries, regions, cities, and locales, each with their own flavor. As such, A Dance With Dragons is, in style and tone, more akin to the first three volumes than A Feast for Crows.<br /><br />The characterization is head and shoulder above basically anything else on the market. At his best, Martin can do things with his characters that other authors can only dream of. And let me tell you that GRRM is in top form in this book! Understandably, the bulk of the novel is comprised of Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys' POVs. This should please fans who have been clamoring for these characters for over a decade. And yet, the secondary POV sections, for me at least, are what gave the book most of its more memorable moments. Which is not to say that the \\"Big Three\\" did not deliver. But the supporting cast is responsible for quite a few surprises along the way.<br /><br />To a certain degree, A Dance With Dragons is Jon's book. Becoming Lord Commander's of the Night's Watch has forced Ned Stark's bastard son to mature quite rapidly. Winter might be coming to Westeros, but on the Wall it's almost there. It is up to Jon to prepare the North for the coming of the Others, and some of his decisions will not sit well with the rest of the Watch and everyone else. Duty appears to be a main theme in both Jon and Daenerys' storyline, with both protagonists following different roads as they attempt to deal with the hand they were dealt. Jon, though he is forced to make choices that might cost him his position and more, accepts the responsibility which has been trust upon him and puts into motion various schemes that will help the North face the menace posed by the coming of a long winter. In this, he is definitely Ned Stark's son, putting honor and duty before his own desires. The character growth is evident, showcasing a young man duty-bound to protect those serving under him and the innocents he has vowed to protect. The Wall may be crumbling, the various forts unmanned, Stannis and his Queen major pains in his side, yet Jon strives to remain true to himself and his oath.<br /><br />Daenerys, on the other hand, refuses to do what she must. She understands her duty, knows what needs to be done, but she is loath to give the order that will see blood spilled in the streets of Meereen. This came as a decidedly unpleasant surprise for me. Dany came a long way since we first saw her as a beautiful and innocent teenage girl in A Game of Thrones. I was expecting a woman grown in A Dance With Dragon, mother of dragons and rightful queen of Westeros, ready and willing to do what needed to be done so she could claim her birthright. Tempered by loss and war, I had expected Daenerys to have matured, to be a queen in deed as much as in name. Unfortunately, the ordeals have left her a frightened and ambivalent ruler, unwilling to pay the price to do what she has traveled across half the world to achieve. Beset by plotting and threats from every side, her narrative is filled with a girl dealing with moral dilemmas and refusing to act as a queen should. Disappointing, to say the least. Will she act before it's too late?<br /><br />Tyrion's arc offers the highest number of surprises. Though our favorite dwarf will always be his witty self, everything Tyrion has gone through in the last few months has left him a bit more thoughtful and humane. Still, his narrative will get a fair share of laughs and chuckles out of you. With a price on his head, Tyrion must find a way to reach Daenerys anonymously, not an easy feat for the Imp. But soon, he becomes privy to a closely guarded secret that will shake the world. It came as a shock to me that such an important story arc could make its appearance so late in the game. I guess that GRRM has many more surprises up his sleeve.<br /><br />As more than half of A Dance With Dragons runs in tandem with A Feast for Crows, the first 500 pages or so features a few Bran POV chapters. Nothing that offers any sort of resolution, of course, but his plotline moves forward, albeit not as much as most fans would like. There is a new POV character that plays an important role in this novel. However, since this is a spoiler-free review going up before the pub date, I will refrain from saying more. Suffice to say that this new POV offers new perspective on certain events, past and present, and is linked with a number of ongoing plotlines. Just when you believed that A Song of Ice and Fire couldn't get more convoluted, A Dance With Dragons raises the stakes even more. Secondary POVs include Davos and Reek, both of them meant to pave the way for what's taking place in the North. The same goes for Asha Greyjoy's POV.<br /><br />As A Dance With Dragons moves beyond the fourth volume in the timeline, the narrative returns to the Dornish storyline, which gathers momentum and rises to a new level. As if there wasn't enough politicking thus far, we soon realize that Prince Doran is not the feeble ruler many believe him to be. Victarion Greyjoy, Jaime, Cersei, and Arya all have POV chapters in the second portion of the book, but these chapters more or less set the stage for what will happen in The Winds of Winter. As I mentioned, the most interesting POV character in the latter part of the book is Ser Barristan Selmy. In addition, the mysterious and shocking storyline tied to Tyrion early on get its own POV character just before the end of the book, indicating that nothing will be the same in Westeros from here on out.<br /><br />For such a huge novel, the pace is seldom an issue. GRRM juggles quite a few balls simultaneously, tying up loose ends here and introducing unexpected plotlines there. So for the most part, the rhythm is fluid and the book is a page-turner. Only the Daenerys POV sections drag after a while, making me wonder why Martin bothered to write so many chapters devoted to her when sevral are just about her wondering what to do and refusing to do what she must. But other than that, thisis a book that will keep you up past your bedtime for a few nights.<br /><br />What many might find off-putting is the fact that basically all the principal story arcs end with cliffhangers. And I'm talking about major cliffhangers here, especially that which caps off Jon's plotline. In a series that's had its fair share of startling scenes and moments, A Dance With Dragons has one that's right up there with the Red Wedding! Still, the absence of any sense of resolution might annoy some readers, given the fact that we are all aware that volume 6 will not be published next year.<br /><br />In the end, I feel that A Dance With Dragons is everything ASOIAF fans could have hoped for. It showcases a George R. R. Martin writing at the top of his game, moves the tale forward like no other installment to date. Those naysayers proclaiming that GRRM had lost his focus and the will to see this project through are proven wrong. Not only is this novel all that the others were, but GRRM raises the stakes to an even higher level then before. The lack of a true ending might irk some readers, sure, but A Dance With Dragons offers so much in terms of plot movement, revelations, and shocking moments that it doesn't truly matter a whole lot. And it sets the stage for an unbelievable The Winds of Winter.<br /><br />True, George R. R. Martin may be a slow writer. He likes to go to conventions. He loves football. He likes to edit anthologies and work on the Wild Cards books. True, he's busy working in tandem with the HBO team on the TV series. True, he most probably can't devote as much time as he'd like to finishing A Song of Ice and Fire. But you know what? If I must wait a few years to get a book of this quality, I say it's worth it. . .<br /><br />As most of you know, I won a football bet with George a while back. I lost our first two bets, sure, but that's got nothing to do with it! :P Anyway, my winning meant that he would base a character on me and then butcher him in a violent and bloody fashion. That was my only demand. I wanted a memorable death. Enter Ser Patrek of King's Mountain (a Montr&eacute;al reference, since we met at Worldcon in 2009). You may notice that the heraldry of Ser Patrek's House is pretty similar to the colors of the Dallas Cowboys. That's no coincidence. I was expecting George to create a very minor character based on me and then kill him off on the following page. But it was very nice of him to make me a knight of Queen Selyse's entourage, to make me appear in a few chapters so I could make an ass of myself, and to kill me (yes, quite violently!) in what is probably the most spoiler-filled chapter of the novel! It's the ultimate fanboy moment, to be immortalized in such a way. You'll see. It's a good death!<br /><br />Impossible to put down.<br /><br />Roll on The Winds of Winter!
0375842209|5.0|The most popular positive reviews for this book more than cover what it was that made me love it so much. I wasn't even sure that I had anything helpful to add for prospective readers, however this novel affected me so deeply that I couldn't imagine not throwing in my two cents.<br /><br />What I can add is how the book made me feel after I finished it.<br /><br />I listened to The Book Thief as an audiobook brilliantly read by Allan Corduner.  By the time it finished I was so in love with the story that I ordered a hard cover edition of the book with the full intention of clutching it to my chest in adoration when I received it.  Yes, I loved it that much.  I have loved many a book in my lifetime but never quite in this way.  Some reading this might say \\"well I have a library full of books that I feel this way about\\".  I don't care!  This is the first time I've experienced this sensation so let me revel in it.<br /><br />I have to say that I was not grabbed right away by the first few chapters but as the story progressed I was completely taken with the characters and the storyline.  Then about halfway through I realized that this was a book that I would carry with me for the rest of my life.<br /><br />It made me laugh out loud at times, it made me sob as well but I never felt manipulated by the writing.  It also taught me how to curse in German.<br /><br />I purposely left out specific details of the story because when I listened to it, I knew very little about it and I feel like that added greatly to my experience. I am sure not everyone will have such a profound response to this book like I did but I can't recommend reading it enough.
1400079276|4.0|Intruiged, I purchased Haruki Murakami's Kafka on the Shore the week it won the World Fantasy Award in 2005. It's been sitting there on my shelf for the last couple of years, awaiting my attention. And recently, it kept moving up in the rotation. In the end, I caved in and finally decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />Why wait for so long? Well, perusing reviews and related material, I soon learned that a vasy chunk of the author's readership never understood the novel. Back in 2002, Haruki Murakami's Japanese publisher set up a website on which readers were invited to submit questions regarding the meaning of the book. More than 8000 questions were received. And according to Murakami, the secret to understanding the novel lies in reading it multiple times. \\"Kafka on the Shore contains several riddles, but there aren't any solutions provided. Instead, several of these riddles combine, and through their interaction the possibility of a solution takes shape. And the form this solution takes will be different for each reader. To put it another way, the riddles function as part of the solution. It's hard to explain, but that's the kind of novel I set out to write,\\" the author tried to explain. All in all, it didn't inspire a whole lot of confidence in me.<br /><br />Still, my curiosity was piqued and I knew I'd read it, hopefully sooner than later. . .<br /><br />Here's the blurb:<br /><br />An unusual and mesmerising novel from the cult Japanese author.<br /><br />Kafka on the Shore follows the fortunes of two remarkable characters. Kafka Tamura runs away from home at fifteen, under the shadow of his father's dark prophesy. The aging Nakata, tracker of lost cats, who never recovered from a bizarre childhood affliction, finds his pleasantly simplified life suddenly turned upside down. Their parallel odysseys are enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerising dramas. Cats converse with people; fish tumble from the sky; a ghostlike pimp deploys a Hegel-spoutinggirl of the night; a forest harbours soldiers apparently un-aged since WWII. There is a savage killing, but the identity of both victim and killer is a riddle.<br /><br />Murakami's novel is at once a classic quest, but it is also a bold exploration of mythic and contemporary taboos, of patricide, of mother-love, of sister-love. Above all it is an entertainment of a very high order.<br /><br />Haruki Murakami has an uncanny gift when it comes to set the mood. Kafka on the Shore grabs hold of you and sucks you into the narrative from the very beginning. As a magical realism work, this strange and whimsical of alternate universes and timelines is an enjoyable, yet uneven, ride. At times, the story is thoroughly brilliant and fills you with wonders. But the meandering and erratic plotlines sometimes become redundant and boring, and the pace is brought to a standstill.<br /><br />The characterization was by far my favorite aspect of this book. Taking center stage, both Kafka Tamura and Satoru Nakata are the driving force behind the two linked storylines. Running away from a terrible oedipal prophecy, Kafka occasionally interacts with an alter ego known as Crow. Most men will recognize themselves in the boy and what he's going through and will relate to Kafka's quest. But although Kafka lies at the heart of the novel, it's his interaction with Oshima, Sakura, and Miss Saeki that makes his storyline so special. For his part, Nakata may be a lovable simpleton who can speak with cats. But his plotline doesn't truly take off until he teams up with Hoshino. Hence, though Kafka and Nakata are the principal focus of this work, it's the supporting cast which is responsible for most of the poignant and emotional moments found throughout its pages. There are a number of powerful sequences, chief among those a rape scene that many might find off-putting.<br /><br />The rhythm is crooked from beginning to end. At times, the pace is fluid and Kafka on the Shore is a veritable page-turner. And yet, in some portion of the book the rhythm slows to a crawl and the plot goes absolutely nowhere, making me want to open my veins.<br /><br />There is resolution of a sort at the end of the book, but one doesn't truly understand everything that took place. Which prevented me from fully enjoying the novel. Too bad, as this could have been a brilliant reading experience. It is good, mind you, but it could have been great.

0375703764|3.0|I've had Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves sitting on my shelf for about a decade. Since then, the novel has acquired a cult following and it is said to be one of the scariest books ever written. I was in no hurry to read it, confident that it would be awesome whenever I elected to do so.<br /><br />Well, I finally did read it. . . And I don't know if it's because my expectations were too high, but House of Leaves can be nothing but a major disappointment for me. Indeed, for the most part, I was bored out of my mind throughout the book.<br /><br />Here's the blurb:<br /><br />Years ago, when House of Leaves was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth -- musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies -- the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children.<br /><br />Now, for the first time, this astonishing novel is made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and newly added second and third appendices.<br /><br />The story remains unchanged, focusing on a young family that moves into a small home on Ash Tree Lane where they discover something is terribly wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.<br /><br />Of course, neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of that impossibility, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story -- of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closetdoor, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.<br /><br />What's it like? Hmmm, if The Blair Witch Project had been a novel instead of a movie, it would have been something similar to Danielewski's cult book. But House of Leaves is not really a novel; it's more like two narratives driving the story side by side. The first, known as The Navidson Record, was recorded by a dead blind man named Zampanò. It's a pseudo-academic study of what turns out to be a nonexistent documentary film shot by an award-winning photojournalist who just bought a new house so he and his family can enjoy a new beginning. Unfortunately, the house turns out to be haunted, which will splinter the family instead of bringing it together. As the plot goes, it is rather thin and nothing to write home about. No, it's the story within the story that truly is a feat of imagination. The footnotes, the appendices, the correspondence, the notes, the interviews,the quotes -- this is what likely helped this book achieve cult status. Yet to a reader like me, more focused on plot, these things were just distractions that always killed whatever momentum House of Leaves had going for it. The second, found in the footnotes, is that of Johnny Truant, the literary editor of this manuscript. Truant found the jumble of pages and notes in Zampanò's apartment when the old man was found dead. A sex, drugs, and rock and roll kind of guy, Truant is an assistant in tattoo parlor. But his life takes a dramatic turn for the worst as soon as he begins to read and compile Zampanò's The Navidson Record. More and more, it looks as though he will share Zampanò's fate.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was engrossed and intrigued from the very beginning. Danielewski's oddly put together novel has a way of sucking you in and keep you turning those pages. But one soon loses interest, as very little actually takes place. Moreover, the excrutiating amount of minutiae found in the footnotes simply proved to be too much for me. In the end, I was just going through the motions, reading on and hoping that something interesting would finally happen. Sadly, it wasn't meant to be. Is it scary? Not one bit. Could it have been? Sure. But I have a feeling that Mark Z. Danielewski spent too much time padding up his narrative with quirky or pseudo-academic footnotes and appendices instead of focusing his efforts on the plot itself and the characterization.<br /><br />I am acutely aware that this is what gives House of Leaves its own flavor, what made it the cult book it has become over the years. And it's all well and good. But unfortunately, it absolutely did nothing for me.<br /><br />The pace is atrocious, made even more uneven by the panoply of footnotes and other devices that take you away from the story.<br /><br />If you are looking for something weird, something completely different, something that you will either love or hate, then Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves might be for you.

B001FB4VY4|5.0|What can I add about this very clever and hilarious TV series, which I just discovered even though it's in its sixth season, when there are already 262 reviews posted here? Probably not much but I'll try.<br /><br />It also took me a while since I started with \\"Complete FIRST Season\\" and just now finishing the second one.<br /><br />Though the Complete Second  Season has been released before, a new \\"Combo Pack\\" is now out (as of July 10th) with both Blu-ray AND DVD versions plus the new Ultra Violet concept - all in one package. (So you will never be without a chance to watch these episodes again and again!). The gag reel and the two featurettes from the previous release are here with nothing added.<br /><br />For those who asked - in reference to my review of the \\"First Season\\" volume, these are all single-sided discs; not double sided.<br /><br />There's no reason to go into the plot of the show - again, it's covered in other reviews - but I did notice that after watching the episodes in the first season (which at 22 minutes - no commercials - are like potato chips: you can't stop with just one) the characters in Season Two are actually becoming more interesting. And they were very interesting in the previous season. . Leonard seems less nerdy and Penny less overtly sexy.<br /><br />The ONLY thing I found a bit of a downer in Season One, and though it hasn't changed in Season Two  - and I don't see it mentioned in other reviews - is that the series uses a \\"laugh track\\" which was very popular in the 1960s before TV comedies started being recorded in front of live audiences. It is really annoying because it sounds phony and you will hear the same laughter over and over, sometimes even before the punch line. It bothered me a lot earlier but I guess I got used to it a little as time went on. It's just too bad that they felt the need to use these. I've been told that there were live audiences there, however the creators feel it necessary to augment the live laughs with pre-recorded ones. But, the lines are so funny that I'm now fairly content &lt;g>.<br /><br />So, I'm jumping on the bandwagon for this series and in the process of \\"catching up\\". If you've read this review before the others, I hope I've encouraged you to scroll down and read some more. Better yet, just sample an episode and, like me, I'm sure you will get hooked!<br /><br />I'm guessing that the \\"Complete Third Season\\" will be released soon in a combo-pack as well.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"pre-recorded ones.

B0089X38EU|5.0|\\"Green Onions\\" was the first Lp record by Stax studio musician Booker T. Jones and his three partners-in-(musical)crime  released after their hit single \\"Green Onions\\".  Like most albums of the 1960s, it contains both the A and B sides of the single (\\"Behave Yourself\\" was originally to be the \\"A\\" side with \\"Onions\\" on the reverse) and a bunch of covers (hits for other artists). The 12 tracks on the issued 1962 release include nine of those covers , with two Ray Charles songs, (Mr.) Acker Bilk's \\"Stranger on the Shore\\", and Phil Upchurch's \\"You Can't Sit Down\\" among them.<br /><br />For those who know the group from their later albums, you'll find out in the new liner notes written by Rob Bowman (an expert on Stax's history) that bassist Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn was not with the band at the time this album was released. Lewis Steinberg - the original member is here.<br /><br />For this remastered release, Concord Music Group (which owns the Stax catalog now) added two \\"bonus tracks\\" - live recordings from a 1965 Stax Revue in Los Angeles (previously released on another Stax CD) which features Dunn on bass. Both are repeated songs. \\"Green Onions\\" is the first; \\"Can't Sit Down\\" is the second (but the live version clocks in at nearly five minutes - almost twice the length of the studio recording.<br /><br />The original liner notes from 1962 are also reprinted in the enclosed 12-page booklet.<br /><br />You can hear the remastered sound once you get half-way into \\"Mo Onions\\" (the only other original composition) when Steve Croppers guitar kicks in.

B0084IHVC0|5.0|This is a review of the Bluray + DVD release.<br /><br />The 1970 Disney animated film \\"the Aristocrats\\" is getting it's Bluray debut on August 21st. There are two new bonuses (in addition to the ones on the previous DVD releases) and one should be of interest to movie musicals collectors.<br /><br />I haven't seen the film since its big-screen release and watching it again reminded me of why I enjoyed it the first time. While children will love the cute little cats, adults will appreciate the fine HAND DRAWN graphics. It really looks a lot different than even the other hand-drawn Disney films like \\"Lady and the Tramp\\". Maybe it is because it takes place in Paris, but I was quickly reminded of the art style of the 2003 non-Disney  animated musical film, \\"The Triplets of Belleville\\", directed by Sylvain Chomet. And the songs (composed by both the Sherman Brothers as well as Terry Gilkyson, with my favorite - \\"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\\" sung by Phil Harris and Scatman Crothers - composed by Al Rinker and Floyd Huddleston) are on more of an adult level.<br /><br />The cast (well the voice cast) is great with Harris, and Eva Gabor being the most well known. And the title song is sung by the legendary Maurice Chevalier, who came out of performing retirement to make this - his last recording.<br /><br />I don't have an HD TV but I can tell you it looks great on my Standard-def screen.<br /><br />The film has been on DVD before (I didn't own it) but the 2012 release (both BD and DVD) have two NEW bonus features, one which is important; the other a \\"throwaway\\" in my opinion.<br /><br />It's a nine-minute piece called \\"The Lost Open\\" which has Richard Sherman (one of the two Sherman Brothers who wrote Disney songs) introducing a two-part song that was to be the original opening for the film. It is called \\"How Much You Mean To Me/ Court Me Slowly\\" and is sung by the butler Edgar and a DELETED character (the maid). They found the original story boards and a demo recording by Sherman and his brother, Robert, and melded the two together.<br /><br />The previous DVD had a deleted song \\"She Never Felt Alone\\" and that seven-minute piece is here too.<br /><br />The only other new feature is a \\"Oui Oui Marie\\" Music video of a REMIX (you know the annoying drum track). That is a throwaway, I mentioned above.<br /><br />Since it's been 42 years since I last saw the film, it was fun to hear Phil Harris and Scatman Crothers again (And hear Nancy Kulp - as a horse - sing too!).<br /><br />Aristocats fans will want this new release - and it should introduce this overlooked Disney feature - the 20th for the studio - to a new generation.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"Sherman and his brother, Robert, and melded the two together.<br /><br />The previous DVD had a deleted song \\"She Never Felt Alone\\" and that seven-minute piece is here too.<br /><br />The only other new feature is a \\"Oui Oui Marie\\" Music video of a REMIX (you know the annoying drum track).

B002BU0DPE|4.0|I've read the reviews about the PX21, so I'm aware of the issues people are having. Keeping this in mind, I bought these on sale for $64.00. I wanted to see if I enjoyed the experience of online CoD with a mic'd headset, without spending big bucks. I must say it is quite an awesome experience to chat with people; some cool, some not so cool... The sound is really good, slight hissing during a quiet moment in game, but no big deal to me. Nice bass, explosions sound cool. Footsteps, gunshots, and other sounds are picked up by my ears so much better than just TV speakers. I can hear sounds coming from right or left, and the Sound Expansion feature creates a bit of surround sound feel; like hearing stuff behind you, although I'll bet 5.1 headsets are much better than the PX21's. Well, from what I've read, I guess these will break in the next few months. But, now I know that the experience is great fun, and I will upgrade to a new, sturdier headset with more features when these are are no longer usable. A good buy for first headset.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got the free version and was blown away at its greatness. I really really liked it. So I bought this one and it only got better. Wide variety of great relaxing noises/sounds. Enjoy that I can customize it to my exact liking. And it can run in the background as I'm doing other things on my kindle. I've never had any issues. Awesome app.

I would have read the entire book in one sitting, but real life got in the way.  I wanted to live inside the world that King created..... and was sad when it ended.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|runs good for me. would like more energy. cute graphics. easy to learn and play. would recommend to others. would like to have more helpers in the game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game. I love that you can not beat it in one day. It gives me and my kids time to design together :)
B007SYWFRM|4.0|You'll lose yourself in this game. I don't like needing to buy so much in order to keep  the game interesting though.
1416955070|4.0|It's been quite a while since I've found a YA series that has been as utterly and completely immersive as The Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare. At the time I'm writing this review, I'm currently reading the fifth (and most recently published) book in the series and I just started the series less than a week ago. What can I say? I get it. I totally get the hype about this series, and why people are in love with it (and Jace! We'll get to him, too).<br /><br />When Clary Fray witnesses the murder of a boy by three young teens, she cannot believe her eyes. Never mind that she seems to be the only one who can see them in the first place, or the fact that these three teens are strangely tattooed and seem to not quite be human. When that same otherworldly danger comes breaking down her home and attacking the only life she's known, Clary is unwilling thrust into the world of the Shadowhunters, an elite clan of warriors who protect the \\"mundane\\" world from the likes of demons and rogue Downworlders, like vampires and werewolves.<br /><br />Set in New York, City of Bones has the perfect backdrop for an exciting urban fantasy. While werewolves and vampires are overdone these days, there's something that I still find so interesting about the concept of angels vs. demons. The Shadowhunters are fascinating, and certain themes echo a bit of Supernatural , one of my favorite television shows, so it was familiar territory for me to read about. Clare's prose is sharp and witty, full of vivid descriptions and snappy dialogue. She also has a talent for writing action and fight scenes so deftly described that I could easily visualize it. I also liked that the story didn't shy away from mature themes like violence and the subject of sex--as an older reader, it was nice to read a YA book that didn't censor itself.<br /><br />Clary was a great heroine, really managing to come into her own over the course of the book. I absolutely adored Simon, her best friend. And I was worried before starting the book that I would dislike Jace, due to the descriptions I had gotten of him, but to my complete surprise, it was the exact opposite. He was funny and sarcastic, and of course completely full of himself, but never once did I get the impression that he genuinely thought that he was better than everyone else--it was just an act, which ingratiated him to me. I really liked how he acted around Clary. The only character who annoyed me a bit was Isabelle, simply because she came off as shallow and haughty, two characteristics that I have absolutely no patience for. The villain of the story was also pitch-perfect--he was scary, seductive, and cunning.<br /><br />I found City of Bones to be a refreshing, pulse-pounding dive into YA urban fantasy. The characters were likeable, and the world that Ms. Clare has created for this series is phenomenal and needs to be fully explored in the upcoming books. I'm extremely glad that I sucked it up and began reading The Mortal Instruments at long last--the only problem is now, I can't put them down!e starting the book that I would dislike Jace, due to the descriptions I had gotten of him, but to my complete surprise, it was the exact opposite.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I would have preferred to give this joke a zero. With all of the praise I kept hoping that something would happen to redeem this utterly absurd tale.  Nothing but a huge waste of time. The writer did accomplish one thing, I feel totally insulted.
1416972242|4.0|** spoiler alert **<br /><br />City of Ashes picks up where City of Bones left off, in a heart-pounding sequel that definitely upped the ante of the first book. Clary Fray wants nothing more than to go back to the way things were, before she found out her true calling as a Shadowhunter, like her mother. However, this is easier said than done, especially when her evil father, Valentine, plots to strike right at the heart of the Shadowhunters and bring the world to its knees. What makes the situation even worse is the fact that above all, Clary is a teenage girl with two very real boy problems: one, her best friend Simon, who has made clear his romantic intentions towards her, and two, her taboo and undeniable attraction to Jace, who also happens to be her brother.<br /><br />I absolutely loved that City of Ashes managed to take the same elements of City of Bones and make them darker. It gave the whole book an urgent feeling that lots more was at stake. Also, the characters seemed to realize this as well, and I got to read firsthand how Clary starts to become more assertive in her role as a Shadowhunter. This book also marked the first book in which we truly get to see Clary's friend Simon mature and grow as a person. His perspective was fascinating, and he quickly became one of my favorite characters as the book progressed, particularly once he became a [spoiler]. By the end of the book, I was most impressed with Simon's character growth, because he starts to see himself as more than just the guy defined by his love for Clary Fray.<br /><br />Jace and Clary's interactions, on the other hand, frustrated me greatly, because even though I know that they couldn't help how the felt about each other, I still was extremely uncomfortable with how they handled their new situation as siblings. At one point, Jace even goes so far as to say that it doesn't matter that they're related--that they could still have a relationship and just hide it from everyone! I'm just really glad that I was spoiled about what happens with these two, otherwise I might have quit the series right then and there. This was my greatest issue with this book, and it's a problem that unfortunately is not resolved by book's end.<br /><br />Finally, we also get to see an expansion upon the supernatural world that Clare has created. Werewolves, vampires, fairies... while they were involved in the first book in a peripheral way, in City of Ashes their role is more pronounced. I was particularly intrigued by the fairies... half angel, half demon, these creatures are as conniving and manipulative as they are beautiful. I love morally ambiguous characters, and the Queen of fairies is the one who straddles the line between good and evil with pride. Of course, Valentine is the true villain in this book, and he really brings it. The Scooby gang have to work past their differences to bring him down, and I thought that they were all the stronger for it.<br /><br />While this book made me question why, exactly, Ms. Clare decided to have the major relationship angst of this book be rather inappropriately incestuous, plotwise this book was excellent and fast-paced. I loved the villain and the character growth, and as always, the book contained the right amount of wit and snark, coupled with a gravity that the previous book didn't quite have. Kudos to Cassandra Clare for coming up with an excellent sequel.that I was spoiled about what happens with these two, otherwise I might have quit the series right then and there.

B004LROUNG|4.0|John Grisham can present his characters as people one knows. their attitudes, quirks, and actions are human. He knows how to tell a story to keep you reading, even though you already know the final outcome of the tale. Grisham's skill keeps one rivetted throughout the story to the totally predictable end. A new John Grisham novel is always a treat and a welcome diversion these days.
