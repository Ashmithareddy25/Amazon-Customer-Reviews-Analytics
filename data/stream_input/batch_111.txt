B009SRQSK2|5|Duck Dynasty is the funniest show and this shirt is the best! I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it, it fits right to size and it looks great! Excellent buy!
B00M0SFI16|4|a little thin, but perfect for snotting in.  Plus, have you ever pulled out a hanky for a girl that was crying?  Pretty much makes you baller if it doesn't already have snot in it.
B00CNNE1JI|3|I did read all the reviews explaining how small this wrap is and decided to purchase anyway. It is very well made and adorable but if I were one pound heavier I couldn't have worn it. I am 5'5 120 lbs. and it did fit but was very snug. Arm holes definitely need to be larger as it was crowding my armpits a bit. Still a great product.
B00UFIRQCM|4|Need more
B00DW7MJC0|2|I bought the other color -- the black and pink -- and it fits ok. This one is ginormous and the built in bra has no elasticity to it. I probably won't return it -- but also I will probably just give it away as it will take up space in my drawer. I think it is weird that the same top and size in a different color fits and feels completely different -- so I don't really trust this brand - I won't be buying anything else from them.
B00BWJ2KHY|2|Let me start by saying that this item is REALLY BEAUTIFUL! It is very sheer & lacy & the color is gorgeous!  It looks just like the photo.<br />That's the only nice thing I can say about this, tho.<br /><br />I WANT TO SAY THAT IF YOU ARE AS SKINNY AS THESE MODELS IN THE PHOTOS, YOU WOULD NOT BE BUYING SHAPE WEAR!!  IF I LOOKED LIKE THIS MODEL, I WOULD NOT BE LOOKING AT THIS ITEM! I AM A REAL WOMAN WITH REAL CURVES. Maybe a little too real.<br /><br />I got the LARGEST SIZE available, but when I put this on, it ends up making MY ROLLS even MORE PROMINENT! The cup portion doesn't come close to covering my bra. It ends up looking like two strips of lace going down my breast.<br /><br />I am going to keep this item, tho. It truly IS beautiful! I'm hoping that I will be able to wear it soon. Or give it to my daughter.
B0098EGFHG|2|But not huge at a size 16.  The one size fits most did not describe this accuratly.  I got another one for my size 4 BFF and it fit her.
B000YSF56C|5|Fits great, breathable. And holds the jewels in place at the gym...washes great...DON'T PUT IN DRYER! Elastic will last FOREVER if you let it air dry....
B00D7HH72C|5|Exactly like the pic it a really nice belt
B00CAN0F6O|4|I love how soft the fabric is. It is comfortable to wear for a casual weekend outing and/or just lounging around at home.
B002C4608I|5|I got this for my dad for Christmas, he loved it!
B004BMXA0A|3|My husband purchased a large for himself to wear in summer.<br />It is snug in shoulders..<br />The belt loop ties too high...<br />Looks kinda funny.<br />Yet it is too long for me (his wife) to wear...<br />I would trip in it.<br />So If your 5'11\\" and 200 pounds....<br />Maybe it isn't for you.<br />He still wears it though.<br />It is okay.
B00N485DZC|5|Excellent nursing tank....so easy and innovative
B001LRM69E|5|I purchased this coat for my father-in-law for Christmas.  He's pretty easy to buy for but doesn't say much about his gifts - he absolutely loved this coat and wore it the day we gave it to him.
B0096D4P2G|4|After reading a ton of the user reviews on these, i decided to go for it and buy.  No regrets.    THe metal on carbon construction is solid, however i can understand people's complaint about the overall quality.  The threading on the finger tips and towards the bottom seem to be a rushed job.  If you know how to sew, this shouldn't be much of an issue.    The yellow, double sewn thread is solid, so the gloves will hold.    The quality, for $50 -/+, is worth it, imo.    As per one of the previous reviews, using some leather conditioner seem to help out with making them tougher.  I recommend doing so.  THey are lighter than what they seem and definitely comfortable.  I'm a XXL and they feel great!    If you're looking for top build quality - i advise looking elsewhere  If you're looking for great protection without hurting your wallet - consider these
B004UUKD6C|5|these are good, quality-made work jeans.  Carhartts are some of the longest lasting jeans on the market, and besides bdu's, it's all i'll wear.
B002EQJVUS|1|I like humor.  I get jokes.  This is neither.  This tee-shirt is as offensive as it gets.  I would rate this with negative stars, if it let me.
B004XYO0H8|5|Very comfy and flattering. More black than gray, but that's not a big deal. I wish I had more of these.
B00DTB8BF8|5|Have worn these briefs for years and they are a comfortable, great fit.  Will continue to purchase in the future.  Thanks!
B006TCIPCS|4|Every thing are ok except size.
B00NBECF9Q|5|Colors are super brilliant and same great quality as all Garcia ties.
B00DDXI9XQ|5|Fits better than anticipated
B005Q9HKT4|4|pants are often either too short or too loose for me. this one fits very well.
B00FEM0OYQ|3|i was expecting the underarmour material thats typically used on their heat gear products. the synthetic one that is known for wicking away sweat. the skirt looked like it was that material but the shirt is 100% cotton
B00T5JKLKG|5|The outfit is cute
B00EF4A0Z2|5|Loved it.
B002HIL8Y0|4|i liked it
B00MHDXE6A|5|Love it
B008H1YCB2|1|The ran horriby small.  I am 5'6 and 135 ordered a M.  They took forever to get on and even longer to get off!  The other reviews were misleading
B007HACZMW|5|I wear it all the time it helps with tummy coverage too with that shirt thats a bit too short on the waist
B008B7RXUY|5|Bought these for my girl friend. I first bought the just the panties, and she loved them. After I saw they have top/bottom sets and got some to see if she would like them too. Wow she loves them too, and I really love to see her in and out of them. These have made me very busy guy satisfying her so often that I been not getting a lot of other things I need to do get done. Oh well, it's a good problem to have. Very sweet and perfect fit.
B00O5K4H6Y|4|My daughter is petite and only normal sizing was available ...... she still made it work
B00M1BIZUS|1|I got a xxl and it fit like a medium, the material was to thin as well and klingy
B00MV66HHG|5|Beautiful dress.  I gained a little weight, but haven't gone up in any of my other clothes, so I expected this to fit perfectly.  It did not.  The size 8 fits like a size 6, so get the dress a size up, and you shouldn't have any problems.  As for me, I'm going to lose some weight!
B006K0VN50|4|I like it for what it is, and I'm definitely glad I have one, but I've found it easier to just adjust my wardrobe by wearing more loose neck items that will pull down. When I do wear higher neck shirts though, I do really like this as it's pretty convenient to just connect to the nursing bra. It doesn't require any extra manipulation to use it besides what you would already do with the nursing bra. I got a small which fits as I expected except that it's a little long but not unreasonably so.
B008EY5EXC|4|I like both of the color and design. My daughter likes them too.
B000KM5PQW|1|They are super thin and run large. THEY ARE NOT SOFT! I found them very uncomfortable as they have no stretch at all. There is a large seam running up the butt so when you sit down you can feel it. I swear anyone who likes these has never worn comfortable boxers. Junk.
B00LZN1EJC|5|great price, came fast
B00PK46HEE|5|After washing it doesn't shrink.
B00CCZSXCS|3|What kind of midgets are they making these vests for. A 2X should not be too small for someone 5'11&#34; 207lbs.
B00BWO3JPG|5|The shirt is made of good quality material and it has been holding up well. My kids likes it, not much else to say.
B00DUB0D8U|5|This jacket is very warm and soft.  My son loves it!
B00VSQSU2K|4|I was hoping it would be a little longer.  But it's a nice weight for summer.
B00080NYU0|5|I was looking for a small and slim wallet. This fit the bill perfectly. I have room for cash, credit cards and my drives license. I am able to hold 4 credit cards, a AAA card and two insurance cards along with my license, cash and a few business cards. The wallet is so slim that there are times I think I forgot it at home. I also really like the location for my license. It is easy to see and if needed easy to get out or in the wallet.
B00PDJTPWC|3|Gets too baggy as day goes on......sad ...They would be lovely but run too big and get too loose....
B005SW4UZ6|4|Normally an 8 is perfect. These are supposed to be relaxed fit, but they seem to be more snug through the hips and thighs. They will stretch as I wear them. Overall they are nicely made.
B000YT34E6|5|If anything it seems to be a hair larger than I wanted. But any other size would be too small. A very nice well made hat.
B006LGWZ64|5|Wore these for the Iron Girl and loved the material and the compression.  Nice price and nice produce for anyone needing an XL.
B00263UZI6|5|The &#34;little wiffie&#34; loves these...thanks all stevevongass A+A+A+A+A fast service
B00DC69LR2|5|It is a beautiful shawl. Very soft. The color is nice.<br />The size is excellent and keeps you really warm.
B00X65AM4A|3|Nice shirt but XL to small!
B00DQ10O60|4|This dress is not perfect but I needed a dress for a wedding I could nurse in and I found this one for a very low price at the time.  Biggest complaint is the sleeve ruffly thing is too long.  I kind of felt like I was in a witch halloween costume so I folded them under and stitched them real quick so they were half as long.  My other complaint is that all these nursing dresses are also made for pregnant ladies. I do not want to look like I'm pregnant just because I am nursing.  So the skirt I found too billowy there was a lot of extra space for a 9 month baby bump to fit into I suppose.  The neckline is a little high but is accurate to the picture.  Nursing was fairly easy the bodice just pulls up.  It is fairly short.  It was challenging to bend over and change diapers or care for my children without showing my behind to all the wedding attendees.  All in all it was a very well made high quality dress with a few styling issues that left me satisfied with my appearance but not raving over it.
B00DCULI06|5|My six-year-old is big into mermaids so she really loved this gift from Santa.
B00SRKE0I8|5|Love this dress. It fits nicely. It is a soft fabric.  It is very easy to nurse in.
B005FJ275M|5|Ordered two after my husband liked my sons so much he wanted one.
B00G32L2L0|4|Nice jeans design
B00KWM5SJY|3|Like the color and the length.  I wish it had a lil more support.
B00BBZBA0W|5|Recommend to any young boys who love John Deere tractors.  Makes a perfect gift combined with a John Deere toy
B005C7OTNK|5|I bought that for my mate and he just loves it ! Good quality of material and resistant (was not damaged after a few washes). If you're a fan of the show, it's great buy !
B00QZTOWEK|3|Too small. Feels like they're going to rip when you put them on. Fortunately they haven't yet but I haven't worn any of them multiple times yet.
B0096UBMS4|5|great product, love them
B00UPQ44SI|5|My daughter loves these jeans!  They're very soft and comfortable and fit great.
B001249R0C|5|Nice and heavy great cut lose but not all baggy. I think they are 15ounce so that tells you they will hold up and keep you warm in the cold season. Not much else to say got them in 52x30 and they fit great.
B00KMS0D0C|5|True fit for me.
B0088FT3G6|5|I was a little nervous about purchasing a wallet online, rather than being able to touch, feel and examine said wallet for quality, color, texture etc in person. I'm quite pleased with my purchase and would definitely say that this wallet is well worth the price. Another sleeve for credit cards might have been nice but then again this wallet was designed to be small/compact so that one can discreetly fit it in the front pocket of their pants.
B0096SIU40|5|Nice fit, very comfortable, stretchy fabric, and great email support about correct sizing.
B00IUTM0ZG|5|Love that there were7 in the package
B00AMIO204|2|Got a hole in the ankle within the first day.....Not sure how that happened since I was sitting down the entire time :/
B00ADHJSVW|5|This top looks great, fits well, and I love the fact that its made in the USA.  Gets lots of compliments.
B00GY1Z6BC|5|I love it,
B003LXCHYA|2|Cheap and flimsy material. Does not look like item pictured on packaging. Missing 2 string puff balls. White feather trim is coming off in places. Quality is not worth the price.
B0038QTXHO|3|It's somewhat warm, and I've worn it sailing in the Gulf of Mexico during 40 degree weather.  It keeps me warm.  The product description said that the lining was &#34;shearling,&#34; but the tag reads, &#34;28% polyester and 72% cotton.&#34;  I don't dislike it enough to return it, but this reinforces my distrust of products made in China.  I would like to have gotten what was advertised.
B00UIMYDJE|5|These brands do not run roomy or big more fitted shirt, they are a great brand with interesting detail to color contrast.
B00CODLCGW|5|like
B00BRRK1CM|5|I love it because it's bigger & just fits perfect in my pocket as well, Thanks
B00CN42DFQ|5|These are the Toeless socks I have always wanted. They are comfy and have a good fit. Just wish the solid Black ones that shows as being toeless was actually toeless.
B000FRZZ8A|5|I've had this since 2007 so I can definitely attest to its durability. It has just barley started coming undone in a few spots, but I have also put it through a lot. I'm not exactly the most careful person. I love the colors together, especially the blood red (sorry if that sounded creepy). Anyway, it's a very nice red. The leather is high quality. If mine finally fell apart beyond repair, I would definitely buy the same one again.
B001JI4NWI|5|I bought this t-shirt as a birthday gift for my brother. He is a proud Air Force papa. He says it is his favorite. Looks good with the AF hat I bought him on Amazon as well. He says it is a nice heavy weight, well made, and it feels like it will last a while.
B00BL16W1S|5|It fit snug and it wasn't too big or lose on me. Great packaging ad speey delivery. My husband thanks you as well.
B00BZ5TFUA|5|Upon donning this glorious hair (for Halloween), I felt transformed. I saw myself on an adventure to take back my mountain and the treasures therein. On a serious note, it is a Thorin Oakenshield hair kit from the Hobbit movies. It is pretty much as advertised. The hair looks good, and has a net that you place on your head. It hasn't tangled too much at this point. The beard is also quite nice. However the beard adhesive won't stick too long if you sweat or are in a high humidity environment. All in all, I would recommend this product.
B00GBVVGCI|4|Looks good , fits well.
B00JXE294O|5|Love these. I can't believe these are Dickies? For women?  I will order more in more colors. Very nice fit.
B00MRQWLIY|5|Fits perfectly and is super soft. I love it!!!
B0059DWKMO|4|This jacket is waterproof and super light but runs a little big. But I got a large it would've been a little short on the sleeves
B009TA3WY8|5|PERFECT FIT- GET SO MANY COMPLIMENTS
B00BBCGJII|5|My granddaughter loves these capris. Glad I bought her medium. Even though she is only 5 foot and weighs 110 pounds, she would not have been able to wear a size small as her belly expands. Will purchase more of these in different colors.
B00A94C5XM|2|This scarf was so thin when I felt it my finger poked through and made a hole. Don't waste your money.
B00OPEABP6|5|Love it!
B008QC0U8G|5|its high quality and plain. just the way i like it. it is cool and has the prefect amt of pockets
B00J5V9Q3C|4|This dress is THE BUSINESS. Color is as pictured, high quality material. Vavavoom!
B00D7NIA54|1|These were uncomfortable. The fabric was stiff and the directions did not provide me with a good fit that stayed put and tied.
B00ET4E4XM|5|Daughter was going through an extreme winter and could not take off to find suitable garment.  My wife owns several pair of these and recommend them so I ordered them for the daughter.  She loved them.  They were a &#34;life saver&#34; according to her.
B00JZ6AKQE|2|I wore it for my last minute wedding. I was very disappointed. It's thin and see through. The chest is too low and the straps we're loose. We had to use safety pins to hold up the dress.
B00JHCEWM4|5|I love this hat company, they always know what up 👍
B00K25WJTS|4|I think I will get a lot of use out of this dress. It is one of those 'fake' dress up items, where wearing it is actually more comfortable than jeans but looks more dressed up.
B00EUREF96|5|NICE FIT
B003S808OE|4|As a woman, I usually prefer earmuffs that go on top as they work like a headband and keep my hair out of my face. But I bought these to wear with a rain hat that didn't cover my ears. They didn't fit very well at first. I had to pull them and then they extended out. This is a nice feature, because they shrink back up to easily fit in your pocket. They fit the best when I put them on with the tag upside down, but if you play around with them, you should get a good fit. I compared prices and these are a great buy.
B00OZELEY8|4|Fits a little snug but as expected... Color is just right.
B003QP33IM|5|Camiseta muy comoda para climas calientes y a muy buen precio aunque faltó mostrar el estampado por atras que afortunadamente estaba bonito. La entrega sin contratiempos y muy oportuna.
B00VOXQKYC|5|Love love love ...absolutely no complaints!!
B00SXFC29Q|3|Ok top if your flat chested, otherwise ok. Padded cheaply looking thin
B00HJOQKTU|4|Very sexy. The top is cute but has no support for cleavage even if you have a little cleavage. The bottom is cute also, it just runs a little smaller than I'd like
B007UT4Z9G|5|Great fit, comfortable. No riding, no drooping. Well worth the price. I even purchased additional pairs. Go perfectly inside boots.
B001QVCJZQ|4|It's awesome!!
B00LX4NZWC|4|Hard to find a solid (no goofy print) 3/4 length gown with pleating at top. So, for all that, I am happy to find this gown. I have enjoyed a similar winter version with long sleeves made by Oscar de la Renta, so decided to try this. However, even though I wanted it to be lightweight, the fabric is much thinner than I expected. I don't really think it's see-through though. I have slept in it a few times and it is comfy.
B00K0U53CK|5|Really lovely dress, and my granddaughter looked smashing in it.  The price was great and it was made surprisingly well.  I was and am very pleased.  I'll order again from these people and would reccommend them to others.
B00C2H6LHK|1|looks better in pics. Cheap Cheap Cheap
B00F90X2DS|1|Good wig not the color I wanted though. It looks more like makotos hair color. Not happy with it
B00DII42C8|5|This swimsuit fit perfectly and looked so cute on my granddaughter.  I would highly recommend it to others.  Thank you
B00FRP6ZSE|3|Arrived quickly. A little shorter than I would have preferred. Washes well. Comfy.
B00BHB7OW8|4|These are super comfy. I'm always worried about things that are one size fits all, because we all know that's not usually the case, but they fit really well! I'm 5&#34;4', 145 with most of my weight in my legs/butt and most things are too tight. These weren't! The only reason I gave it 4/5 was because the colour was slightly different than in the picture. It had a little more green in it than I had wanted but they are still really cute and I love them
B007FVO2FG|3|I needed a black slip for some of my darker skirts, and I purchased this one because of the snip-to-fit feature.  While I didn't return the slip because my need was urgent and I couldn't afford to waste time on the return and re-purchase of a similar, higher-quality item, it was disappointing.  If I stand with the light behind me, I can still see where my legs are under the slip and skirt, which is the point of a slip--to cover that!  I wear skirts every day at work, and I've learned to only wear this slip when the color is absolutely necessary, like when a skirt has a dark lining that only goes to the knee, and I prefer something a little longer.  Otherwise, I use my other slips with higher-quality fabric.
B006SVWGUW|5|Very cute ! I used it for a baby shower. It will be a nice keepsake for the new baby
B003ZDOQZO|5|I love it because it was  somewhat big. I dont like anything clinging tight to my skin.I love the fit
B00DYYWFVG|5|Great suit - runs a little on the small side - my daughter is very petite but had to buy up a size...
B00L6CXLUW|4|Bought for my 11 year old who wears a size 12/14 girls. Roomy enough for her to layer a shirt and sweater. I read in a review that it ran small, and it is, but my daughter loves the style.
B005NAFQCE|5|POLO by Ralph Lauren shirts are the perfect fitting shirts for me.
B00KFMZWLU|1|Did not come in US size
B00AZ7Y1IA|3|Nice shirt.  The buttons dont really stay closed.  Bought an XXXL expecting it to be big...shirt actually fits like a L/XL.  Delivery came very quickly.
B00F4OEMH4|4|I like it and my hubby loved it!!
B000F4PDGC|5|My 23 year old son thought they were great and added to the Yoda costume to make it look more authentic.
B007A0R3VC|5|This is a great hat for just about any occasion.  Brim covers most of the face and back of neck without being to big. Love that it is washable and packable.  Arrived on time & in good condition.
B00C9WJ8X2|5|I wear a size s or m in Victoria secret pink brand. Probably won't fit any size larger than that without being uncomfortable. Good quality. Gone through the way several times with no problems.
B0084XU3YI|3|I bought this as a gift for my little neighbor girl.  She normally wears a size 12, but size 14 was the only thing available.  I thought she could wear next year if too large.  However, it was really snug and the snaps would pop open when she bent over.  I will have to find another little girl to give this to since they removed the tags.  The purple color was nice - her favorite color.  I was disappointed.
B0042L4H5M|3|The cap is constructed well with a fashionable look. However, I do not like the overall design in that it seems too narrow compared to a normal flat cap. It kind of looks like the cap worn by the Empire officers who report to Lord Vader in Star Wars. The bill also is too long for a flat cap but it comes in handy since I've relegated its use to times I work in the yard when the Hawaiian sun is at its brightest. Because of the design, I don't feel it looks good enough to wear otherwise. Good thing it only costs $18!
B005C8CI3W|1|Uncomfortable groin area
B00CXRLBRY|5|I received my first credit card with an RFID chip. So figured I better start carrying my credit cards in a metal wallet. I'm using this for six credit cards and my i.d. cards (drivers license, medical, etc). They all fit nicely in individual slots, and the little wallet snaps shut. Holding them secure and safe from outside snooping. It is also real easy to open (even with one hand), and the cards are displayed nicely when you need to select one to use.<br /><br />The wallet can carry your i.d. and credit cards. However, if you also carry some cash, then you will have to get a money clip, or something. I tried including 5 one dollar bills (which need to be folded in half and then in half again, in order to fit in the wallet). The wallet would not snap shut. Even when I removed half the cards.<br /><br />Also, be careful, the wallet's outside covering scratches very easily. I put it in my front pocket with a small pocket knife. Carried it that way for a day, and the wallet now has a couple small, shiny scratches. So now I have it in the pocket all by itself. I suppose normal wear-and tear will eventually scratch up the wallet. However, you can minimize that by carrying it in it's own pocket with no other hard objects...<br /><br />I really like this wallet, and recommend it for keeping your RFID cards safe and secure.
B00K2IWKG2|4|Nice pants, but the run small!!!
B00BLHYP1Q|5|It fits great, low maintenance with flats or heels to dress up.
B000GDGUQ4|5|I love these onesies!  I put long-sleeved onesies on my son under his sleep sack for the summer months, because I think he would get too hot in pajamas.  They're really cute and my DS appears to be quite comfy!
B00UH0XUDC|5|Fit perfect  good product
B002EB06DY|5|I bought it for my niece the quality, texture, size and design are just so perfect it was as expected.
B00H8JI4C2|5|Awesome t shirt
B00MH63ZZ2|5|Pics taken in these & for Christmas cards & they looked so sweet!
B001G58V40|5|I absolutely love these slacks -- they wear well and look great!  This will be my primary source going forward.
B00AMIQ64E|4|Love theses socks they are just a little tight for me around the calf area.
B002GYVX2C|5|I needed a black tie for a \\"black tie\\" event, so I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I'm always weary of buying things without a review, so I'll do you a favor and write one for you.  I think for some products, price shouldn't play a part in the review, but I think for clothing it is usually a deal-breaker since usually you can find clothing significantly cheaper for relatively same quality.  I know ties can be super expensive, and you sometimes get what you pay for.  I think this tie with an MSRP of ~$50 and being sold for $25 is a good deal.  It is name-brand and the quality is on par for a $50 tie.      I own several other ties from Brooks Brothers and some italian designers that cost a lot more.  They are of better quality, but at 4x the cost on occasion, that is to be expected.  If you are looking for a good tie at a good price, I think you will be pleased with this item, so I give this tie a favorable rating.  Just don't expect some crazy embroidery or anything, but at the same time, this tie doesn't look \\"cheap\\".  I like the striped look of this tie as well, it adds flavor to an otherwise solid color.
B00E1LCYS0|3|It's a little larger than I expected. Thin material.
B00FM7FTQG|5|This is a very nice bathrobe. It is a bit large on my 3- year-old, but I expected that. (She currently wears 2T & 3T & is 37 inches tall... if that helps.) It is a nice solid, bold red color. The material is soft and cozy. The hood fits as you would expect a hood to. I definitely recommend!
B00PIQXVV6|4|Nice jacket.  Runs a little short.  Ended up getting a tall size because the pockets are high up and the regular was a little short.
B003YXZ9KG|5|perfect
B00A3HFV0E|5|Levi's in general are a little more loose than some other manufacturers but, in my view, not a size larger. I expected the selected size to fit slightly loose and that is how they fit. Good workmanship and finish.
B005XK8OHS|3|looks nice but hard to get unwrinkly....still looks wrinkly after ironing
B00JR2ADJ0|4|Beautiful color and great design
B007DKMWI8|5|These looked like the size a 4 year old would wear as they are narrow and small but they stretch out nicely.  I am using them for arm warmers at night b/c my T shirts leave my arms bare; burrrrr.  I'm very happy.  Love the color. Powder blue. I think I will purchase the super long ones next time.
B000O1SV8I|2|too short in the rise
B00LQL18CG|3|The shoulders are cut too wide, but overall the coat fits.  The quality of the fabric is good!
B00BF72YSI|4|It was a very nice dress, I liked it a lot and its so comfortable.. If you like simple things its the one
B004V9PWO0|4|All OK
B001FOR1UC|5|nice belt I would recommend it, it is a little short in length but I wear my belts tight so its fits me fine.
B00KY5L86Q|2|Socks are great quality and fit well.  The colors were terrible.  3-4 pairs out of 10 were great and the rest are basically unwearable because of the horrible colors.  The picture is very misleading, they were pink, peach, coral, teal, etc.  I read a review from someone else who said exactly this and didn't take their advice.
B004XAEMXY|5|My 4 -yo is delighted with the looks, and I am very happy with the quality. 4T size is true. Stretchy bodice will last a couple of years, I hope. The flower removes easily, it is not sewn to the dress (in fact, my daughter does not want it, but it's a nice flower and will be a pretty brooch or headband)
B004J0T4DQ|5|Love this sun hat! My little boy loves to be outside and this is such a necessary item.  We've gone through a few hats with him and this one is definitely the best.  The drawstring on the back of the head tightens or loosens so that it can fit well and not fall into babies eyes and face.  The tie string on the neck keeps it from falling off.  The ear and neck cover are really the seller here. Comes down perfectly over the back of his rashguard so that no neck burns.  It's very lightweight and cool and dries really quickly when wet.  Order up - I've found all the i play brand stuff runs really small.  My son is large for his age - 27 lbs at 11 months and I ordered the toddler 2-4 size.
B001BEZ5G8|5|I have bought so many in different colors.
B00KRTUE46|1|These just aren't flattering in any way. They actually flatten and bind the front, which is both a little uncomfortable and awkward looking, and seem to accentuate the hips. It's amazing how much skin these show while still looking more conservative than a pair of boardshorts.
B00KISUBVW|5|Good fabric , very good quality , the colors are the same as the picture . My son really liked it.
B00A3PEZE4|1|I sent them back because they didn't fit.
B003WYMARM|4|I like the shorts but they are a bit too big. Wanted 2X but I didn't see it. (Smallest size was 3X)
B0086DWWXQ|2|Gives good lift but a weird shape. Too pointy.
B00199GZMS|3|Bought this for a wig I was using as part of a costume. Glad I did. Really helped the inexpensive wig stay in place & none of the little stray real hairs trying to stick out of the wig.
B00Q3XINX4|1|Really not what I expected thumbs all the way down!
B00INH512Y|5|My Mother bought these for me has a gift and I love them!!!And I got five days before expected the date that was suppose to here
B00S1MZCIO|5|Received this scarf and I am so pleased with it! The colors are true to what is shown online. The price is hard to beat too!
B001H3QJ6S|5|great shade without the smothering of a regular hat.
B00D3REUAS|4|This is the second pair of PJs I have purchased from this brand.  I love how the style fits close to the body without being tight.  These are the best PJs I've found for infants.<br /><br />This second purchase, however, is defective.  The zipper splits in the middle of the night despite the style fitting well.  It is the same size and style as the first pair of PJs I purchased but it appears the zipper is faulty.
B006B5XZR8|5|I love when a proud man looks like a proud elegant man, and these are the best way to show off his sexy body
B00H9AR3RC|4|No Complaints.  Was kinda difficult to get the chain off.
B005OUWZF4|3|The clasp and wiring were too flimsy for the cup size I needed (FF).  I loved the shaping of the cups, but can't go without more support.
B00LD22ADO|4|A little snug, compared to other size 6X's.
B002XULPFE|4|Nice material and color. She did not like the fit around her neck too small. It seems to be a poor trend with Capezio turtle neck leotards, but otherwise itis nice
B005EM41MC|5|THEY FIT PERFECT, SO COZY, MY BABY LOVES THEM, I EVEN USE THEM AS GLOVES AND THEY ARE PERFECT FOR HIM =0)
B00422MCVM|4|Quality isn't quite as good as I expected, but the price is right and it works well for people like me that don't carry a lot cards in their wallet.
B00BNBB3JC|4|If you're a DD doesn't provide much lift so you don't want to wear this with a suit or dress.  It's very comfortable, it's perfect for running errands on the weekend and around the house when cleaning.
B00EORQ2UW|5|Much better than I expected, good quality, cute and decently priced.
B008P3J8S4|4|I liked the fit !
B00MG7NS8Q|5|Super cute for the money!
B00F77OE5S|5|excellant product and service from vendor !
B00JRTUVG8|1|The product is horrible. Really see through. It also fits really tight so I reccomend to get two sizes bigger! The color looks more of a faded red. I never wore it in public, it looks too aful for that. I do not recommend.
B000BIUJ0C|5|These are reasonably priced, fit really well, shrunk very little, and 7 belt loops is great, they should be standard , not just for large sizes. Bought another pair as a backup. Can't say how well they'll hold up, but everything else with this brand has always been a cut above regular stuff.
B00AO5NQG6|2|I didn't see any references to the lack of back material except for bra, waist and thong straps. I expected the back to look like the front. Then it would be a complete garment. My wife and I both hate it. The front looked great. Excellent shiny satin bra and see through body.
B00NDPH6F6|5|I love the color and the fit.  Product was exactly as described and was shipped and received very quickly.  I'll definitely order from this vendor again
B009NBA25K|2|I have loads of tops from this store and I absolutely love 99.9% of them! This however, is not good. Just kind of ugly, unflattering and feels and looks cheap. Patty should drop this from their line ASAP!
B00V3C12RE|1|The XL looks like a size 6-8 , had to give it away couldn't get in it. Sad face....
B005EO4OH2|4|Nice shirt for the price. I have a bigger bust size so got a medium. the sleeves are a little loose but it fits good everywhere else. Nice length too
B00U5SDGQC|3|The color was definitely NOT what I expected and NOT what is displayed in the picture. Instead of the light pink displayed, it's an extreme hot pink. However, except for the color, I have no complaints about the wig itself.
B00EHW1826|5|IIt is an excellent price for the quality of the product
B00ALQU3A0|4|These are so nice to wear...you almost can't tell that you have them on.  They are so soft and comfortable.  I love how dark they are so that you can dress them up or down.  Definitly a great purchase!
B001LFU9M2|5|I am a big believer of these things! My wife got different sizes of these for when she loses the baby weight. These are amazing! Her belly actually shrunk and she wore each of these sizes for a week-2 weeks and was able to move on. Best post-partum product!
B001AHUTC6|5|I bought the 3T for my 2 year old knowing it would be a bit big, but wanted to get a couple years out of it. We replaced his 18 month size at about 2 years old. The elastic at the wrist and ankles helps with using the larger size. It is great for damp/wet playgrounds, camping, the beach, puddle jumping.  Generous size allows it to fit over winter coats, so also good for snow play. Really keeps kids dry. I like the yellow for spotting him when we play in the woods or are camping.<br />My new favorite baby shower gift.
B00CI9AONY|5|This is a very well-made item, the fabric is viscose (rayon) and workmanship precise.  The style is super versatile, elegant or casual.
B00AZNBQXC|5|I measured before I purchased. I ordered an XL, and my head measurement was right at 23 inches.  The hat was too loose on me.  Instead of exchanging it for a Large, where I fear might be too small, I just added some padding on the inside using black Velcro strips. That did the trick.  The hate exceeded my expectations on quality, especially for the price.
B00D927NR4|5|It looks exactly like the picture, maybe even better.  Fits great, looks great.  I love it!
B00WAJGEGS|4|I liked it and the wife lol when she saw the face
B00F9NOZLI|4|nice but runs small
B002BYL7JG|5|My favorite most comfortable brand for daily wear - great for small chested types
B00DR72J16|5|The list price on these is $107...and it is easy to see why!  They are truly comfortable and the dark and light leather looks great. The fingers are also the right length: many gloves seem too short (my middle finger is almost 3.5 inches long). They are a tad on the warm side in the heat of the summer which is why string-backed driving gloves may be preferred in the warm months.
B00FC9C5LG|3|Very thin poor quality fabric.
B00T3J0VUS|5|Great fit,. A little pricey, though.
B00S4DULNQ|1|I dont like it,it flat on the side and it look different from other
B00CM6R5U8|4|Fits me great. Great to wear to work or an evening dinner with friends. I absolutely love the color combination!
B00CE19J00|2|There was no distinction between boy's or men's sizes. Choices were just small, medium, large or extra large. No women's sizes were offered as well.
B008MATC54|5|It's a little hard to put on and take off. Once I had it on though I did not want to take it off. It does an excellent job of keeping my skin intact as I recently lost 30 lbs and cannot seem to hide the excess skin from showing. Great product. I ordered three more
B00O1D88JC|4|It fit her but wasn't as poofy as I thought
B004XJKEUA|5|(Insert cheesy after school line). Leaves little (or a lot) to the imagination of a school girl gone &#34;bad.&#34; Definitely suited for roleplaying.
B0088AK17Q|3|This pajama set is ok. Quality is mid grade. I ordered a size large for my brother who's about 5'10 and 150. I think it will fit but I'm scared it will be snug after he washed and dries them.
B000ML0VCO|5|This wig is perfect for every day use. The frame is rubber so it is stronger then my other wigs, and because it only has two curls, they don't tangle. It is a little bit small, but that just makes it stay on better.
B00MJODC46|1|I returned it back today, this isn't true to size this had to be a small labeled as a X-large.  it was a pretty dress just not sized properly
B0088EYPEC|5|So farso good.  has what i was looking for and holds all of my cards and lots of my hard earned one dollar bills.  Surprised by the quality.  I would recommend it!
B0012MKE2Y|5|A super nice tie, really well I recommend Amazon, I am very pleased    Thanks
B00MVYB0PC|3|Cute but fit my granddaughters like shirts or tunics rather than dresses. Very short in addition to small.
B0031KMJOQ|5|These pants are sturdy and fit true to size. The double patched knees are great to keep from wear out  for a painter who is on their knees a lot. I recommend them, in fact, I have been painting for over 40 years and these are the only painters pants I buy any more because they wear so well.
B0081MVRKQ|5|great!!!
B00B72HEXG|5|These shirts are amazing.  I've seen many silk shirts for over $200, so these are a great price point.  They look like they are very expensive and go well with both jeans and nice work pants.  The fit is a loose one so I have to tuck it in, but still really like the look of it.  I'm 5'3\\", 120lbs and got the extra small and it still has some room in it.  I got the pink and liked it so much I just ordered the cream.  Highly recommend!
B00QQB4H1A|3|This is not as dressy as the photo makes it seem. Sizes are very small especially if you're busty. Theyare good for casual business or jeans. The material is soft but somewhat tight in the shoulders. I would definitely size up one or even two sizes.
B00KPHOBSA|5|really soft, comfortable and stylish.  i like it slightly larger so the sleeves are long.  its a decent length even though I wish it was a bit longer.  I am 5'4.
B00E97KIIE|5|I got this for my wife and she has gotten nothing but compliments on it.  The size description was accurate and it fits here perfectfully.  It is a great all-weather coat and looks great with most anything.
B00NVOC1PE|3|The T-shirt design is absolutely adorable! However , I had the same size problem as several other reviewers. Normally a medium , but I ordered an XL because the medium was skin tight . (I'm 5'5'', 150 lbs.)
B0077DYU0O|3|They're fine but a bit ripply and baggy around the fingers
B00JBSHDJS|1|I do not understand because they do not brushed my shirt, This message appears when buying.<br />We're sorry. More than 90 days have passed since you placed this order from Gavin's Warehouse.
B0048BHICU|5|I can't express in words how cute this dress is !! Also runs true to size and I love that the straps are adjustable. My boyfriend who never comments on the clothes I wear says it is the most girlie looking dress I have in my closet!! I do feel really feminine when I wear it and that feels good. I read some of the reviews and was a little worried that people were saying it was a little thin, it is not and also has a lining that you cannot see through..Just a totally adorable dress!! I will definitely buy from Feel Good Apparel on Amazon again. Love everything I have seen from Alki'i Jardin de flores.<br />Definitely a must in every woman's closet and I am a 55 year old woman!
B00J4UELSY|5|excelente
B00NNT53DO|2|The size label are not correct.  I normally  wear  Extra large it is to small.
B00K5TB1EU|5|i loved it so much I ordered another one.
B00DZIBFMQ|5|This is exactly what I wanted for an inexpensive price.  It fit's well.  It could be a little longer but it's as expected for a petite size.  I love it and it's great for work.
B00L53FZAQ|4|Very good item wear it a lot
B00CYRDE2I|4|I saw this and thought it would be a great kick around sweatshirt without being too heavy. It is but it runs a little small hence the four stars and because of the type of material it doesn't stretch.
B009TA2Y6U|5|I received these gloves quickly, they are exactly as pictured. They're comfortable and mine are sewn well. I wear them at work so have them on all day while typing etc and have no problems. They are a tad long but so what, that's probably just a personal thing. would order again.
B00EPQ4HDQ|4|Nice pj's. Jacket a little large but sleeve length is OK. Will have to take 6&#34; off inseam of pants.
B007PBO95Y|4|Looks Similar to the one shown in the posting. The material can be better, but at this price, I am happy with this sweater. It took less than 2 weeks to arrive from Hongkong to California. The vendor is very responsive. And they explained the size difference between the US size and the size used in Hongkong. So even it is labeled as XL, it fits me fine.
B00BTPPGHM|1|I used the measurements provided and the top piece was too small. Very disappointing.
B00OAUC98M|5|very comfortable, very flattering.
B00NTOZNGA|5|Wonderful
B00CALR7WG|5|This dress is so beautiful! The picture does not do it justice! It is so vividly bright and it has sequins on it that sparkle. I have to order more! They had a variety of different colors!
B002KDKE3I|5|I was afraid that this fabric print would be too \\"grandma\\" but not the case.  Even though it is a light flannel, it is very warm.  I love it!
B000CQ1ALA|5|The gradient on this shawl is really pretty and you can't go wrong with silk.
B009OZKEX0|5|They fit like a glove and wash nicely. Very roomy in size, run slightly larger then size. I now have one in each color.
B00H91C3GM|5|great and comfortable shirt!
B003P2VQ62|4|Nice bra but didn't fit comfortably for me.
B00EHAGZNK|4|Bought this for my 5 year olds birthday and it is a little long for her torso.  The black fabric fits below her bust line when she has it on and the bottom portions where it snaps hangs a little low.  Otherwise it is very cute and luckily she will be able to grow into it, in the meantime she gets to play dress up anyway.
B00KW2GPQY|5|Very beautiful.
B00CC716I4|5|This is one of the few online clothing purchases I don't regret.  The shirt looks good and fits very well.
B008S98JQ2|5|Typical Dickies quality. Durable and holds a press really well.
B00DVS4IX8|1|Very thin, runs very small, poor quality. If the sizing were slightly better, material slightly better, or there weren't a small hole in the seam, I might have kept it as a light spring sweater, but I immediately returned it. Oh, and it was an off-white color instead of white.
B00K0U58FW|5|This dress is really prettier in person, andt fits exactly as sized.  My granddaughter loves it.
B00G2J4ALI|2|It runs too small, size L it's really a size S. The swets are really nice and cozy but too small.
B00AE7FZ2M|2|I wish I could return these they run very very small at the waist I recommend one or two sizes above us natural size or u will waistline money like I did bc I don't know how to return .
B00455RR4I|1|This hat is a piece of trash. It's ELASTIC and leaves a ring on your head once removed. In other words this hat is for a young child who doesn't know any better. No purpose for it being on the website because they are not old enough to have credit cards.
B000PQGAU8|2|It's does not hold its shape
B00HU0BYG2|3|Three stars because the customer service was quick and helpful.. But the description should be a bit more detailed. This item is specifically for the costume, not the mask. It does come with a mask but it is a cheap plastic one, not anything like what is shown in the photo. I figured out that that mask is separate, otherwise he robe is exactly what you would e pact from a Halloween costume. As others have said this is not a coplay quality costume, you would be much better off trying to make your own. We actually got very lucky at the Thrift store and found a red leather duster, I'd recommend starting there if quality is what you are looking for.
B004SWGN16|5|I read a lot of reviews that said they ran REALLY big.  I wear a 12/14 and ordered a large.  Would not have wanted them any larger.  They are part of a costume for a play, but I can't wait to wear them in the future TO play.
B00EXJCDFY|2|runs small, I need to return it!
B00FF1ZJ8M|5|I'm a G-Star addict. I own 6 jackets (or &#34;overshirts&#34;) by them, a few over 5 years old, and all of them have held up both in build quality AND style. G-Star's look is fairly timeless - black is never not relevant - and the brand's attention to the small details while maintaining a minimalist appeal is what I admire about their product. Matter of fact I have G-Star boots, t-shirts, jeans, etc. and all of them with the exception of a pair of pants have held up very well.<br /><br />Since I know how G-Star fits I was right to order the Large in this overshirt although I am typically a Medium in other brands. I prefer a more fitted look. If you like baggy clothing you might try a size (or two) up, however, I generally wouldn't recommend G-Star unless a slender fitted look is what you're after.<br /><br />I'll pay a premium for this brand due to it's quality & style so when I find a low price on Amazon for G-Star products I know it's a true bargain. I purchased it for $60 which is just unheard of when in a department store you'll pay upwards of 3-5X that price for this jacket.<br /><br />I recommend this product and any other G-Star products and Amazon is a great place to get a deal on this fantastic brand.
B00MJU7YX0|5|I'm so happy with the service n the clothes are so beautiful
B00IKCMPJO|3|This Maleficent head dress fits as expected, however, when it arrived and I tried it on, one of the horns was twisted in an awkward position and I couldn't straighten it out. Therefore, I returned it for a refund which was quick and easy.
B00G15MF2E|2|The side stitching fell apart very soon after buying these...
B0006I8E68|5|I bought this camisole in a 38, thinking that it might shrink, but it did not.  It provides good coverage under white blouses, although it is a bit warm for hot summer weather.  If it is hung up, any wrinkles will disappear.
B001IBHONG|5|I have been looking for this size wallet, was what I wanted.
B00CCCVRYM|5|Great product
B00WLEVAE8|5|Love it and so does hubby.
B00B182H1A|5|This is so soft and just fits perfectly. I love it. It is my new favorite bra. And the straps on the shoulders are just a little bit wider than the normal smaller bra which makes it so my shoulder straps dont fall down. EVER! i have not had any problems with this bra, i would recommend this to everyone, especially ladies who are either bustier or a little heavier. And it helps smooth through out the back area also.
B00G47MZJW|3|Nice, but they sent me the wrong color.
B00F8IQZYE|3|Nice little &#34;sweatshirt&#34;  Not very heavy but nice for a the little superhero in your life.
B0050JQTTW|5|I was looking at Spanx but didnt like the price so I ordered this instead. I love it. I am 5&#34; and 160lbs. so needless to say I am uncomfortable in my clothing. This will not make you appear smaller but it will make your clothes fit better. I have no more bulges and Im not adjusting as much. It is very comfortable and you forget that you are wearing it. It just makes you feel better in what you are wearing.
B001EW7308|3|The material is good, I got the &#34;queen size&#34; and they were WAY small so definitely not true to size. :( the price was good so Im not going to complain to much. The shipping was fast so another plus! I would say if you were a 16 or more voluptuous these will be to small :(
B00AXVAYGQ|2|In addition to running small, this suit had a strange, unflattering fit. It also arrived with a hole in it that looked as if it had been slit with a box cutter, so it was immediately returned. Due to the awkward fit, I had no desire to exchange it, even for a larger size. Unfortunate -- it looks very cute in the picture.
B00MFJNFJW|4|super cute! Print a bit blurred...oh well!
B004SWGLAO|5|Wear this every day
B008FJCSUS|5|Wonderfully surprised.<br />Product a nice deep brown and buttery soft.<br />Fits well but not much extra room for a sweatshirt or a hoodie.<br />Still it is a keeper as it is well made and so stylish<br />Very pleased
B003X26SJY|5|very good
B00535QB9Q|5|nice
B0051XP4KC|5|Bought a second one because this is the only device that will hold my daughter's 18 inch pony tail into a bun secure enough for JROTC. It is still difficult because of the amount of hair but the bun will make it through PT tests and still be in place.
B00U0G6JUY|5|I love these pants! I got two of them and I like the way they fit me. A bit long but I can do the hem later. They make my legs look longer and slimmer. Perfect for my office wardrobe. Thanks Rekucci!
B00LIQRFVW|5|This vest is a really nice piece of clothing. It fits perfectly and is well made. It's also very warm and looks very stylish. I thought it was going to be &#34;white&#34; white; but it's not. It's actually more of a cream color. I suppose that's what winter white is?
B00HFI6W4I|5|The description and photo were exactly what the product turned out to be.  The price was great for the quality.
B001LK50US|5|I ordered a shirt through Amazon from Maui Harley Davidson. I received the shirt in a very timely manner. The size was correct. I'm not sure if any of you have noticed, but not all companies follow the same guidelines for size. You might order a 2xl and the label says 2xl, but when you put it on, there is no way that is a 2xl. Well, Maui Harley sells quality shirts that are the size they clame to be. Way to go Maui
B00DMEDX50|3|ok but too much glitter
B003YJBYIQ|4|Second purchase of this product...I like them!!!
B00MJXJ5D4|4|This was the best  Elsa wig!  My daughter received so many compliments on how much it looked like Elsa's hair.
B00NTYGS4Q|4|Overall a great pair of pants and look very sharp. It's also extremely comfortable. The only thing I wish I knew about was the annoying draw strings inside the waste that I still haven't found a purpose for. It's basically a pair of jeans with sweatpants draw strings inside. Very odd. But not enough to deter you from buying them.
B00KHAGXQ8|5|These are perfect.
B00768LFYY|1|Was not thick enough could not hide all my hair was highly disapointedvery very cheap. U get watcha pay for.
B003BQ05IM|5|Bow in the back is kind of big. I might take it off.
B00VXB5PS2|5|Really soft and a bit thin and it did fit snug but that's the style
B00HPQI4BO|5|So cute , my granddaughter is so cute in her crab!
B00GNFF08I|3|this was a gift an lit up the kids eyes but i recommend putting 5 bucks in it lol
B00K3I8U9W|5|Love it!
B005KVWA52|5|Item is great. It was for my son and he loved it!
B0045F1BS6|5|This shirt is AWESOME!!!! Washes great!  My husband loves it.  Came quickly with no hassles.  I will be buying another too!!!
B00L3EMMJY|5|Great shirt I like my shirts slimmer because I'm skinny and this fit great.
B00BZP1OKE|5|This is a very flattering jacket that I would love all the time, but the jacket is a thick and very warm jacket. Living in California I only had about a week of weather that was cold enough to allow me to wear it.<br /><br />This jacket should not be run through the washing machine, I had a friend who bought one as well and he ruined it. :(
B00439ERWG|3|No belt tip came with the buckle. It would work with 1 1/4\\" belt best. The metal is flimsy feeling but so far it has held together. I'm going to continue to look for a more robust/beefier buckle that includes a tip.
B00J7V387K|3|size says 9-11 seems like it a kids 9-11  but did arrive promptly
B00GAZJ0BE|5|This  is the most comfortable, well supporting bra that I have ever owned. I will probably be buying more of this style soon.
B00G4DADL8|4|Not terribly airtight but with a humidifier stick, you can enjoy two cigars anyway!
B00EZSVAK2|5|I am 280lbs, 61&#34; across shoulders, 55&#34; chest ,20&#34; arms.  These Hurley XXL shirts fit just right.  Snug but not baggy.
B0041EH928|3|It feels cheap.  The fabric is very thin and the fit a slightly off.  Not very comfortable around the neck area.
B00PVLQ2TQ|5|Unlike a fanny pack this can be hidden under your clothe because it is flat and it will do the same thing a fanny pack can do but with more pockets and it's more strong, the belt itself is well made enough to withstand strong forces.
B00QHR56GS|3|Love the shirt, fair quality,  but runs very small!  Would have rated it a 5, if weren't disappointed in size.
B00M11Y584|5|Very pleased great quality
B00BFETJ7K|1|The shirt that came in the mail looked nothing like the photo pictured. The red is more or a pinkish red and there are no distress marks to make the shirt look worn in or vintage.  Extremely disappointed but will not be returning because it is not worth the hassle.  Look elsewhere if you want a nicer American flag shirt. The fit is somewhat small upon arrival, it will most likely shrink into too small after washing.  After the couple thousand washes it might take to give it the distressed look it wont fit.
B00JRSRLLW|5|My wife loves the support and style that only Wacoal provides
B00N730TRQ|2|I ordered a small and expected to be somewhat loose fitting, but it's definitely too large and extremely baggy. Not what I expected.
B007T7BFIS|4|Coat fits well, is comfortable and nice looking, good size pockets and plenty of them. Just have to go slow with the zippers or they snag.
B00I0IF266|5|I bought these in anticipation of the coming summer heat and have to say I'm really enjoying them. They are comfortable, cool (in both meanings of the term) and they are very well made, especially considering the price.<br /><br />The only issue I had is with the sizing. I ordered the large and while the top fits great, the legs are are a bit too long. Nothing a few minutes of hemming couldn't fix.<br /><br />Overall, these are great PJs. For fifteen bucks, you can't go wrong.
B006N1LR3O|1|This is definitely a fashion bra, not comfortable enough for everyday wear.  I found the material itchy.  The cups are also ill fitting.
B004FWZUAO|2|Not really that great. It's going in the costume box as a backup.
B00D7KCM2O|5|Very high quality
B00DM2HPOW|5|I absolutely love this dress! It is so comfortable and classy looking with a little flirty swirl at the bottom when I move. Perfect for many occasions.
B00SG54YKI|1|I ordered a large and I couldn't even get it over my thighs. U have to order 3 sizes bigger than what u normally wear. Good  material though.
B0087AYE2K|5|Great fit, looks good.  Has enough stretch to keep their shape.  Thinner than what I'm used to for jeans...but they look good so not complaining!
B001W9032S|5|The hat is beautiful, but the circumference of the part that fits on your head is a little tight. I think it will stretch out over time. I love the W-I-D-E brim, it's perfect for the hot sun in the Southwest! All in all, I really do like this hat. It's beautifully made, and this color is perfect for any outfit.
B00K0AJC3Q|4|Good
B009UKJIHM|5|I got these for my brother who is in a wheelchair.  They have nothing to leave a sore on his bottom and were priced more reasonable than the wheelchair clothing.  I would recommend these to anyone wanting a comfortable pair of pants to lay around in on the weekends.
B00KVJH3CI|5|So cute for kids!!! I love this shirt and my 4 year old son wears it with pride.<br /><br />Definitely would recommend it.
B004DNVQ1C|5|Got these for spring break with the family.  Very comfortable and the many pockets are a plus.  They dry quickly and appear to be well made.  Very happy with the purchase.
B00PK1EIJI|3|The Shirt Seemed Pretty Plain In Person . The Colors Shoukd Be More Brighter .
B00GJ1RCZU|5|Perfect
B00NL7GSCS|5|Very cute and I love the style. It is very perfect to wear on summer.
B00JPNTFKY|5|Love it, love everything I get that's by Fox racing! Amazing deal!
B00ANFMK9Q|2|I bought the 3XL, i normally only wear 1X but this shirt didn't fit like a 3 XL should. It was also very short. I like it but not my favorite.
B00EEDB18O|5|The color and fit is as expected.  The subject is great!
B00GL2HEAA|3|Cute but so hot, I couldn't keep it on for long.
B002A9JX48|4|Ordered item thinking it has the comfort fit waist band like my current Men's portfolio pants.  These do not have that feature.  These pants fit much larger than I would have expected for the waist size.  I would need a size below my 'normal' fit.
B003V8B0MA|5|Purchased hat for camping trips with Boy Scouts.  Found it to be warm and durable, use it all the time now.
B00J9C5PVO|1|Colors bled ruined .stitched parts bad quality.
B00B3PZDQW|4|nice jeans for the price
B004FHA7IE|5|I love my Sugar Free Sox! They're smooth in my shoes and they never squash my toes! I have 9 pairs now for myself and I got 3 pair for my husband. He loves them too. We only wish that they were warmer in the winter. I guess you can't have everything:)
B00FEES1Q2|1|This sweater has such a  weird cut to it, it is difficult to make look good when waring it.<br /><br />The gray color eas way to light.<br /><br />The price is right.
B007HTEZLW|4|This sweater is OK. I wish it fit better. It is a bit baggy for my and my husband's taste. The quality is good and colors are as pictured. For the price paid it's an ok sweater.
B00GIGHSOQ|5|Lovely
B00F9TBRYU|1|very small it was the largest size and it did not fit me. i am usually a medium, i ordered an extra large. it was too small.
B00M3GY9WY|3|The straps detach easily and are itchy--I had a rash on my back & shoulders after wearing the teal one all day. Otherwise, they're fine for the price.
B00LQL076E|3|The sizing was wrong for me -- the &#34;large&#34; would have been too tight in the shoulders but probably a better fit in the torso.  The &#34;X-large&#34; gave me the room I like in the shoulders but was too big by far everywhere else.  The sizing range was disappointing and I'm not surprised that I'm having to return this coat.  If you have more of an &#34;apple&#34; figure it might work for you.  It's cut for someone with narrow shoulders and back.  If it came in individual sizes, it might have worked.
B004XH5YXE|5|fits very vell and  really comftorable
B000FXUUDY|4|Quality Just as advertised, waist somewhat tighter than expected, but will purchase again
B0064KVGGC|5|Very good product
B00K00B0EK|4|Looks just like the picture. I wear a 7 1/2 shoe size, the sock is a little snug, I wouldn't expect a great fit if my feet were bigger. 4 stars because I would have liked a slightly thicker sock, it's a little on the thin side, but over all satisfied. Great novelty item.
B00KGZXT5M|5|So cute, perfect for his first birthday party!
B008YY8U10|5|Compact, yet holds everything I need.  Well made; definitely will use for a long time to come.  Also fits nicely into my purse when necessary.
B00LCVXEKO|5|I've received lots of compliments on this sweater.  Fit's great and very comfortable.
B00QKZ4D8E|5|These socks are fabulous! Your legs feel great after having worn them for a day! And they wash well.
B00R9QV2UA|5|love
B005WUQ9UI|4|I absolutely love this shirt.  It is comfy and I wear a lacey tank top underneath for a cute look.  Size was a bit smaller than what I was hoping, but I think that comes with ordering online.
B003BYKOF8|5|Beautiful scarf!  Very sparkly and attractive.  I use it for belly dance class and get compliments all the time.  I wear a noisey coin belt over it to get the best of both worlds :)
B00DEK17TQ|5|Nice to have this type of robe that is not &#34;one-size-fits-all&#34;
B00AOJJW7O|5|These are somewhat tight, but I think it's due to the thick fabrique. They don't look like jeans, more like pants. Feel and look expensive. The price was awesome and made in the US- it's a keeper!
B0007YR9LW|5|I love the bra However I should have gotten a 44 DD. I will get extensions to fit better. I do not want to return it.
B00AKR3XPC|5|Right Size, and feels great at the gym
B00HXRUMDI|4|Since the first time my daughter watch Frozen she wants whatever merchandising it's related to the movie. It was so hard to get these on any retail store, but, thanks to AMAZON, my daughter has them!
B004QHOBTE|5|This is very comfortable to wear and is of a little heavier silky weight! Just love it. The color is great too!
B00NCX22GM|1|The product was packaged well and arrived on time.  But it wasn't quite what I expected - it isn't a dress, unless your child is very short or you want her to wear a mini dress.  My daughter is the average height for her age and this is worn as a long blouse over her leggings.  The material is flimsy and she needs to wear a camisole underneath.  Had I known all these facts before hand, I would not have purchased it.
B000A38F0O|4|I had a hard time deciding what size to buy because I have long arms.  My dress shirt size is 16X36. I thought I might need a Large Tall but I went with the regular large and the arm length is adequate. I won't wear the shirt with a sport coat anyway so the sleeve length is not as critical.  The fabric is heavy weight and feels very soft on.  The shirt has a real good feel and a definite 'wearability'.  I hung it up immediately after a few minutes in the dryer and smoothed it out with my hand and it doesn't need ironing so ease of maintenance gets high marks.
B00O85HZ8I|2|The design is cool.  Too bad it doesn't fit.  This XXL shirt is made to fit a normal American men's fitted size L.  I guess I would need a XXXXL.
B00K4O7T8I|5|nice, very nice
B00HRMDIT4|5|Great quality, fits well and the material is soft. The color holds up well when washed. I'm very pleased with this tshirt!
B00CKLHYC4|4|I first bought a large because that is the size that I usually wear.  It was HUGE on me.  So I returned it for a medium.  Fits well, except that it is very long.  I would recommend if you are tall
B00M3Z6O00|5|Great jeans.  Good quality denim.  Worth the money and they fit like a glove.
B00846FHP0|4|reasonable price, nice understated plaid patterns, relaxed fit, items need to be washed first to soften them up before wearing.
B009PCJ3LG|5|Very handsome fit
B009FV8DEU|4|Fits a little small however, was a great shirt! If your a med buy a large and so on.
B00E6OX48Q|3|Wanted gloves that I could wear in cold but be able to unlocked iPhone and dial numbers.  These work ok but I find the tips with the white cover for smartouch to be unreliable.  Sometimes it takes a lot of pressure to get the phone to unlock.  Forget texting as these are too big of a surface area to work on the small keyboard.
B00J5ODXF6|5|Great robe. Very sexy. Feels good on. Nice a roomy but not to much so. I really love this robe and wear it all the time.
B00ESNVNBU|5|Best clear straps I've come across.  I like that they are mat rather than shiny plastic; makes them less noticeable.  The metal hooks ar sturdy and the straps are securely attached to the hooks.  (same review written for the wide straps)
B002K6F7CS|3|Maybe I got a lot bigger than I thought after the baby, but the medium was too tight for me. I was 34B pre-pregnancy (and honestly don't know what size I am now that I'm nursing). A more specific size chart would have been helpful.
B00L4K6J7I|4|Great fit
B00G9JE3QS|5|I WORE THIS ON MY FLIGHT ARRIVING INTO HAWAII AND GOT SO MANY COMPLIMENTS, WILL SURELY BE BUYING ANOTHER IN A DIFFERENT COLOR
B00E4XSIBW|5|I loved this hoodie, I ordered from the men's because I wanted a bigger fit. The media pocket is great, and for the price I was pleasantly surprised.
B00GWC8DXG|4|I love this dress. The fit the style the color. It's just as expected. Worth the buy. Arrived onetime as expected.
B00DR6KTCI|5|great fit, and the soft cotton is very comfortable. if you aim to misbehave, I recommend that you do so. in this shirt.
B0008EOJHI|4|Very comfortable
B003R9523G|5|Very cute buttoned to return runs small
B00BXXNT4M|5|The blouse fitted perfectly.  It was everything I expected.  I was very impressed with the quality of the blouse and I loved the shapeness of the black and white!
B003CR46PS|3|It is a cute little wallet. My son has loved it. However, I was very disappointed with the color. It is more of a hunter green than a lime green, as pictured. I don't know if i would have purchased it if i knew it was going to be the color it arrived... Definitely not as advertised.
B00SPG9XH2|5|A Little big but soooo adorable!
B0094QTR0K|5|An excellent product. It's so cute. Nice, comfortable, beautiful. I recommended it. An excellent brand. Not expensive. I love it.
B00M89ESEK|5|I absolutely LOVE this shirt! I it is soft to wear and incredibly lightweight - perfect for hot humid weather. The crinkled texture ensures it never looks crumpled, which I find a big plus.
B00LTTK94S|2|feel cheap.
B00AO7E8UC|1|While shipping was quick, the ink on the front if the shirt bled all over after the first wash....the tanktop now looks ugly and dirt stained, the top row of letters is hard to see b/c of the discoloration. I won't be keeping the top, and wouldn't recommend this buy.
B00KL7L02E|4|Nice cruiser one time washing it will fit better
B001PTGBAS|5|I absolutely LOVE these.  They are so soft, and I love the shiny top part that says Calvin Klein.  They look really good on too :)
B00FLOI2DC|4|the size was not just x-large but tall, so it is a bit long. not a problem for tucking in.
B00GI1MSF0|4|Love the design, the fabric and the sparkle. It's a little hard to raise your arms very far but overall I like it and thought the price was just right.
B00HFB7AX2|5|I have a trick shoulder so these bras save me from a little pain when putting on/taking off.<br /><br />I have a bunch of these in different sizes. When I'm doing physical stuff I put on a tighter one... a looser one for bedtime.<br /><br />Occasionally you can get one with a faulty zipper. What I mean is that the zipper will either not stay up...or it just unzips when under pressure. Just exchange it for another.<br /><br />I have washed these in cold, warm and even hot water. I also dry them in the dryer - although this isn't good for them. But at this price, I just buy a new one when one wears out.
B0095D1H2I|5|I love the new lower and shorter style of these shorts! I remember wearing them in my teen years and having to roll them down to be comfortable. In my 30's now and still love them for lounging around the house!
B00A0HTI10|4|Fits as expected.
B000KRG6PG|4|Fits me a little bit big not wide but long but the wolf is beautiful
B00IXF7U1G|1|Quality jackets disgusting.<br />Radically different in color from the image.<br />I do not advise buying.
B009IJO7YE|5|This just a cargo short for daily using. I like that the length to the knees. Also large pockets very useful. Shorts a little bit wide for me, but I wear it with belt.
B004LNTAC6|5|Seems like it's made really well and I love the style! Has plenty of slots for cards and it even has a change zipper. Love it so far!
B00SD1RSSU|5|This shirt looked great and fit true to size. Carters has never been a disappointment in there quality of materials used.
B00HHOXWA2|4|I love it but I sure should have read the reviews before buying.  I can't wear it but my daughter loves it and is going to take it.
B005HBGYMK|5|It fits very nicely a bit long, however worth it and size is the right one. I bought the black and the white one then I bought the red one...they are all the same..good quality.
B005C9G710|3|The size and fabric are great but the color is not as pictured. I ordered these because all I could find in the stores in medium were packages with pink and teal in them. I knew my hubby wouldn't want those colors. I was excited to see manly colors so I ordered them only to still receive pink and teal boxers. Very disappointed
B00D7EJONU|2|I love this shirt and so does my daughter but after only one day of use, the sequins from the stars are falling off. I really expect her to only have a couple more wears before we donate it to goodwill. Sad.
B00816RXV4|3|Received the yellow, pink and white pack. Was hoping for purple, pink and white pack. A little bit see through. Good length.
B008OPTQQC|5|Perfect! Beautiful! They are meant to be snug as they are driving gloves, but the narrowness makes them a bit difficult to put on. I ordered a Small based on the sizing chart and they fit &#34;like a glove!&#34;
B00VCKHHYE|4|Size was a bit large, had to sew it smaller
B002KJ1HKG|5|Great costume and very reasonable price.  Fit was as expected.  Highly recommended.
B00CBEF5FS|4|ok i read one review on here that made me want to buy them, the lady put her measurements and they were close to mine and she said they fit her. So im 5'3 159 pounds and they fit better then i thought they would. I have kinda a big stomach right now cuz im 5 months prego and there is still no muffin top. they are a really soft fabric but they are see thru so i would wear a dress or long shirt with them. if you have a really big butt they might not fit. and if your taller then 5'5 i wouldnt get them im 5'3 and they come almost perfect around my ankles. i think if i lose the weight i want to they will fit perfect.(like a glove) :)
B00KEHTV5Y|2|Nice looking shirt.  Suzing is fine with one exception.  Its not long enough.  Needs to be at least another 4 inches longer to be on par with other plus sizes
B003YPGQWE|5|Every thinks I am a great painter, when wearing the hat, but I'm only a medium grade artist at best
B00BZ5RBBK|3|I decided to get this outfit for my wife for, since she is such a huge fan of the Sonic games. When she tried it on it was clear that this thing was the real deal as she instantly saw an increase in speed. All was going well until she ran over to give me a hug of thanks, and we collided hard enough to knock the wedding ring off her finger. I was pretty sure I saw it flashing in the light as it bounced away, but after searching for it for over an hour (even with the wife's impressive new speed), it seems to have vanished.
B008H1Z0OU|4|great sports bra! Very natural shape and very comfy around the back. The straps are just too tight for me, I'm looking for a little more give.
B002C4W0FU|5|Beautiful snood!  The fit is perfect; tight enough to stay on without pins, yet loose enough that I forgot I had it on.  I highly recommend this snood.
B00H8XSL44|5|Great socks,  my son loves it. Much easier to put on than shoes and much more easier to walk
B00ELJBX7U|4|The actual  cup is a little small. So I was quite smashed. Great quality.
B000VWE5SK|5|My husband is rough on clothing and this is an absolute necessity for working. Also, it keeps him very warm in the wintertime. The fit is perfect!
B00PFQAWFM|5|Love this scarf, really great and the color is very nice (:
B00F6CKPSE|2|Okay quality, nothing impressive but it's soft and hasn't pilled or fallen apart yet. My complaint is the length... it's really short. I'm kind of tall but not so tall that this should be an issue. I wanted to wear this at the waist, but the only way I can wear it is around the hips, and it's still short, hitting about two inches above the ankles. Pretty bummed because the selection of colors is so good... if it were 6 inches longer I would buy probably a dozen of these. (seriously... whoever makes these should pay attention. whatever few cents you save by cutting these short, you're losing more in lost sales. just make them longer and you'll sell a ton!)
B00KVE1266|4|i love these leggings but they are pretty thin...but still super cute
B004BHIZHI|5|i have these jeans on now i brought them from love culture these jeans makes ur ass look bigger then what it is an a litle fuller i wish all jeans were made like this i love these jeans <3
B00CQ21Y1E|3|Despite loving the material and feel of the pants, the pant legs were too tight on my (admittedly slightly larger than average) thighs.  Wanted to get the size up, but Amazon was going to charge me ~$20 for the correct size (due to the original pair being a sales price).  All in all, if you can figure out the sizing then have at it, otherwise the style is not worth the exorbitant price point.
B00PB63XHK|5|Better in person!!
B00FAOFKBA|5|If you want a raglan with two different colored sleeves then this shirt is for you. Fits perfectly and nicely shows off your muscles even if you don't really have any.
B008H2ETBE|4|I've bought Hanes crew socks for over a decade.  They last and last and are comfortable.  It seems that there are two versions of these socks - these are the thinner of the two. They are still comfortable and I expect them to last for years. If you want ten pairs of white crew socks these are an excellent choice.
B00KOGK73K|1|Bad quality
B00RZ4ZC5C|5|The dresses looked exactly like the picture, I tried it on as soon as I get home from work and it fit perfectly.
B004A8SFIW|5|I was very pleased with the quality, efficient processing and speedy delivery of the hat during the busy holiday season. The hat was reasonably priced. I would not hesitate to order additional products.
B00OJZ1VPK|3|It's ok
B00ADHGT3M|3|Cute..but slightly fitted.  Get a larger size that is advertised.  They run small.
B00D2CKBL6|2|I found the scarf to be very thin and cheaply made.  I am going to return before its to late.
B00FZET2LO|1|This feels like a trashbag, and fits like a permanent wedgie.  Too bad it's shipped direct from China, so returns are impossible without costing more than the item itself..
B00550PVPY|3|great in biging after a couple of washes grew larger
B00NSIB0LY|1|The dress shows red and it is orange. It doesn't look anything like the picture. Shipment was late. I don't like the dress and will be giving it away... Disgusted!
B005KOJ1UG|5|I got these for my husband for Christmas and he was quite impressed with how long they are. My husband is 6'4&#34; and trying to find socks that fit and don't cost an arm and a leg is tuff.
B001OR9PUO|4|The product was what I expected it to be but it was missing one out of the six strap prefects it said it had. No big deal but I was informed it had six not five so I was expecting five.
B006JYG5ZK|5|On first sight...very nice.  The sleeves are a tad long, but not a big deal...the fit is almost perfect.  I am going to Japan, early spring and think this will keep me pretty cozy over a blouse and sweater.  Great buy...no issues with the zipper.<br /><br />It would prefer not having the brand name printed on the front the way it is.....
B00MW3YNM4|5|I'm 5'10 and I wear a size 8/10. The dress fit me just right to a little snug. It's absolutely beautiful and looks great. It has enough flare that you don't need an underskirt but I wish I would have ordered it. I think it would have looked very nice with it. This is definitely my type of dress and will be ordering more.
B00ATTB128|1|Tangle free,  I  dnt  think soooo, try  knotted up, hardtime  here.
B000GEGD3I|1|I just received my Pumpkin Spice Wig today. It was shipped in a timely manner, but it looks NOTHING like the picture. What I received was a mop of tangled hair and one side is longer than the other. Hopefully I can make it look half way decent in time for Saturday's Halloween Party. I'm really disappointed in this product.
B001EMVU0W|5|The gorgeous brocades in these Banaras silk scarves with their enamel like decorations can be seen in a number of paintings from Shahjahan's period known for their minute details. The main patterns in these scarves are similar to those seen in Mughal paintings, like floral arabesque, geometrical trellis designs, and the ogival, surrounded by decorative borders.
B003SDKVU0|5|The product is way more than i expected, the fabric is beautiful and the size perfect. It is all that i needed for bellydancing.
B000BTBPUE|4|Nice shirt.  A little small but maybe I got a few xtra lbs
B0007O7DF4|5|OMG, its amazing! It fits me perfectly, has a clean quality to it, I LOVED mine!!! It's definitely worth buying when u want this jacket separate from the costume!
B00BFJHO86|5|I am not a bathing suit fan, however, I wanted something colorful,  a suit that would compliment my body. I am NOT a beach body girl..but this suit is Perfect!!!<br /><br />It fits well( in all the right places, covers  is beautiful and, colorful!<br />Definitely worth the $$!<br /><br />Monica
B0038QNT6A|5|I love these pantyhose.  They fit great and don't bag around my knees and ankles as I have small legs.  They arrived on time and in the condition as described by seller.
B00GPKSK5Q|5|Love it exactly what I wanted and exactly as described!!
B00TAXMVOG|1|I ordered an extra large receive a small .beautiful blouse couldn't wear it would have took to much time sending it back.and receiving it again.
B007P61HXG|3|Ok but, just basic.
B00D2N8CRK|5|I wear a lot of black and this vest dresses everything up.  I get lots of compliments every time I wear it.  Love it.
B00B2HLEBO|3|Fit nicely in my purse and I love it. It is light enough in color so things are easy to see.
B00J3Z99KU|5|I've been losing weight rapidly (down 60lbs since September), and this belt has nearly been a life saver. It has 'contracted' with me from 48 to 40. It does a great job and looks great, too. I'm planning on buying several different styles to go with whatever wardrobe I eventually fit into.
B009431WRE|4|Had to send back for 34. It fit but no room to go down in size. Trying to make waist smaller. But made good.
B007JE3CHS|4|Good product for the price
B00D5YSSNO|4|the scarf is beautiful and even nicer than described.  I will be able to use it to ad to out fits and make a new look for myself.
B00EUKIBM0|5|Flattering and fits my large cups but small around the bust.
B00AFEGD9S|2|Have had several of these wallets but this one came apart at the seams in no time at all. Would never buy this style again.
B008OE595K|5|My wife loves it....and they fit nicely on her hands. very soft and confortable and fits into her purse or bag.
B003IXVFLO|5|I should have bought this sooner.  I have a tall, skinny kid and this is great for keeping his pants up. Much easier than a belt.
B00AHPC0OW|5|A GREAT GIFT FOR MYSELF, NEEDED A NEW ONE FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S WORTH THE MONEY AND<br />LOOKS LIKE IT WILL LAST A LONG TIME.
B003FKMOWY|5|solid wallet
B001TO4YK8|2|Liked the look of the outfit online but disappointed with the outfit - not lined and runs small.  Would recommend to order a size larger if ordering this.
B00MTFXJXO|5|Love the cut/fit and style of these undies.  Will buy again.
B00ARBSMR0|4|this is a cute shirt. very different from US style. a lot of people complimented. shipping isnt too bad. i will be shopping again.
B0076PG1GE|4|its the prodruct described in the description
B00EBPWDAK|5|This is a wonderful PJ set!  Beautiful soft fabric that washes up beautifully and dries in the drier perfectly!  Love it very comfortable. I would not hesitate to give as a gift!
B00NQ7UXEM|5|I bought one but i was to fat for it so i had to order a bigger one now i can look skinny but not actually be skinny i am a lazy person and dont want to work out or eat right to loose weight so this is perfect for me
B0051NTHL4|4|Very Comfortable :)
B008GS6XJ0|5|These have been one of my favorite denims for the last year.  They fit great and are extremely durable.  I even wore them when I waiting tables, and they still look brand new!
B007XK2E40|5|I bought this awhile ago but forgot to post a review. I am 5 feet even and petite I<br />bought this in a large and it fit just right not too short and not baggy. I wanted<br />to add that in there so others don't get the wrong size. I didn't care for the G-string<br />It came with as I prefer regular thongs. But, overall it is a cute babydoll and good<br />quality! The shipping was fast as well.
B00XJ1GAB0|1|The hat is sturdy & good quality for the price but it came completely smashed. It was shipped in a bag & had no protection around it. Very disappointing.
B0018R196S|5|These are terrifically comfortable jeans that look stylish for ordinary wear around town and are nice enough for horse shows (yes, they *do* fit nicely over my boots! ;)  They are just elastic enough for comfort, but don't look like &#34;stretchy&#34; jeans.
B00LG8MKW6|1|My son needed a red tie for a national high school club competition. This would have probably been ok for what we needed I will probably end up returning it.  You definitely get what you pay for! The thread is bunched up in several places throughout the tie making it appear as though there are random dark spots on it.
B00PIHICVY|5|usually, i wear M, according to the reviewers's suggestion ,I  bought L. It just be perfect for me.
B00S0HQ2QG|5|Really cute dtess
B005SJKO7M|5|great hat.... wished it came just a touch bigger but it works... definitely keeps you warm on a cold windy night ....
B001NFTS04|2|I thought XL would be big but it seems to be sized on the smaller size just fyi
B00ALKMU70|5|Bought this for my husband. We both love Under Armour. If you have never owned anything Under Armour you are missing out.
B002TOY7PE|2|I was excited to have a short and bra in one sop not to hike up my shirt when nursing. I though about this purchase for a while due to the price and decided it'd be worth it. I was careful about the sizing, the fact the size I ordered was the same as the bra without tank attached. I love my bravado bra 32 d/e. However the tank was way too small. I was very disappointed and don't understand how the sizing could be so different from their bras. I returned the product. Bummer!
B00OCBW8I0|2|the bow was hot glued on! came off!
B00D1R82Z4|5|I waist train and I have purchased those Ann cherry corsets before.. And they worked but not like this one ! I WEAR THIS EVERYDAY ALL NIGHT ! I change to a waist cincher when I am at work! (I am currently wearing a size MEDIUM in THIS CORSET with PANTS SIZE 6-7 in women /juniors)This corset really works ! You tie it from the back so you can tighten it till you feel comfortable but with a nice snug. I don't measure my waist but I can tell the difference because all my pants no longer fits me :) I get compliments from all my friends :) I have the curves already but I'm willing to go down a little bit more. I already purchased myself another one but size xsmall . I do not recommend to wear this at the gym maybe work (sitting at a desk) . I do go to the gym but not everyday .. Every other day or every 2-3 days. I eat but this corset tell you when to stop because it'll get tight and that's when you stop eating :) works both ways for me !
B00739XRIS|5|Good
B00CPYI97A|3|I bought this to match a lavender skirt but this top wasnt as purple as in the picture.  It was more diluted.
B005I34I9I|5|Just what you want in a winter work glove.
B00FHN9OR0|1|Did not fit way too small
B00DWYKWQ8|2|Sending it back, unfortunately! It's too bulky! It's much heavier weight fabric than I expected. But it is nice looking, just not for me.
B00GP1LIS6|5|I love this dress! Comfortable and not too boho. Great material and quality.  I love the deep blue color so will hand wash in cold water. I am going to also buy in another color ,,cuz I will wear this dress often
B008UAAG5G|5|I love this shirt!! People laugh at it all of the time! (Or maybe it's me...? No it's the shirt. :p) Fits true to size and I find it to be comfortable.
B00CEH1FVA|5|I have bought these before at a retail store. I love them. They fit without binding, have no gaps or baggy butt. Have very little panty line either. The crotch is wider than a lot of other panties. They breath and are not hot to wear. They also wash and dry beautifully, no wrinkles.
B006UXEBGK|5|Quality, color and look are all first class. Wearing this at my sons wedding. Will look like a real cool dad
B00FXQ1U78|5|The best work shirts ever.  Durable.  Comfortable.  Long lasting.
B00CL8M6FG|5|Our son requested a Mickey Mouse costume for Christmas, but the reviews I read of the costumes made me question the fit. I decided a sweatshirt that made him look like Mickey would be better. This was exactly the right things, and he loves his Mickey &#34;costume&#34;! Fits as I expected it to, even a little roomy. The zipper sticks a little bit, but other than that it's perfect.
B0084D72L0|1|I have 3 of the original 5 ring Waterbourne straps that are looking a little shabby so I bought one of these in the hope that it would match the longevity and practicality of the waterbourne's/ Unfortunately, if you use this strap the way its designed to be used by locking the watch through the first two rings the band ends up being too short to secure the watch to your wrist.<br /><br />Its about an inch too short (and I am not a big guy)<br /><br />Sadly disappointed because the band is unuseable.
B000TR29L2|4|Style has clean lines and washes well even after 100+ washes.  Make sure to take it out of the drier as soon as it's done and you will never have to iron. Only negative is the draw strings never stay tied, constantly I find them dangling in an awkward position.
9789885725|5|Great pattern.
B00DR1EZ64|5|Easy to adjust, although it does make slightly loud clicks when you adjust it. Doesn't bother me, but it's something to be aware of.
B00PWUHFX8|5|It's warm and fits perfect
B00L383PIC|4|Beautiful tops but too small for my mother who normally wears this size...we were sad...
B00W6KTYHW|5|Love the way it looks on. Just need to get it hemmed, a problem I always have. Wearing it on a cruise in October.
B003NI5QZ0|5|Perfect for Wreck it Ralph Costume
B003X7GGTQ|5|Excellent for cold windy weather. The gloves are a great value and the warmest gloves I have ever owned. Try them you will love them.
B00DTIWQQQ|5|Gave as a gift to my niece - a &#34;must have&#34; for any animal print lover!
B00KIL561O|3|Too small
B007F8RMQA|5|I bought the small and medium size and I'm glad I did. I'm 5'5&#34; and 128 lbs and the small was a tad too tight. The medium fits comfortably. I know these panties are a bit pricey but the quality and feel of the material is worth it.
B00Q533EAO|5|A perfect shopping experience. Thanks to Amazon and ECMS express.Its quality is very good.Wear it feel comfortable。产地危地马拉，穿着有型，有个性。前胸英文较颓废：我一半的钱都花在了赌博、酒精、女人，剩的另一半浪费了。
B00RO4NDHW|1|Nothing as I expected very disappointing
B00QTZIJ0I|5|Very cute, good quality, but the price has nearly tripled here on Amazon since I purchased them just a few short weeks ago. I paid only 6.99 & now they are 20.00. Makes no sense to me.
B00NOEZAYU|4|good looking
B00KSGBGFE|5|excellent product,price and service
B003R44BQU|5|Very High Marks
B009SNPGEU|5|I love this bra so much. It's supportive, cute, and all around great. It looks great under shirts too. It has a molded shape and NO padding. I highly recommend this bra!
B00HRXJ4GE|5|It fits really well, and came earlier than expected. Its very unique, I bought it for a 40's/50's party but I'll wear it as an everyday dress too, I really love it!
B00L6170SW|3|A little small
B00CI2S5QO|5|I brought them in red! They are thin leggings but they're quality! Can't wait to wear them. I think they definetly are meant for thicker girls who can fill them out:) love these leggings
B001H0F20U|5|No reason to spend the extra money another brand. This shirt does a great job and it shipped quickly. Will order more.
B00180G8UM|4|I've received it on time but still didn't prove... I hope it will work as well as it looks like.
B00DUH33IQ|3|fit is true to size but lumpy seam in the back is very uncomfortable
B005LCN144|1|Didn't know US Laws allowed a blatant rip-off of Ralph Lauren shirts. I purchased 3 thinking they were Polo Ralph Lauren as the logo appears. Once received them noticed instantly they were fakes.<br /><br />Amazon should not allow this item or at least should mention not Ralph Lauren in title.
B008LP5BD2|4|Big hit at the bachelor party.
B00BS9OK26|3|shrinkage after wash buy larger.  i got lucky.  legs and sleeves were really long.  after a wash in cold my 4t purchase fit perfectly
B00GNYCPUU|5|Beautiful art work. A bit heavy
B00284B5UK|1|My order came today.....and I returned it today. I ordered my size (xl) and it did absolutely nada. Sigghhhh..... The hunt is back on. Don't waste your time or hard earned dollars.
B00DSNGUJG|3|I bought both the sapphire and tomato versions of this dress to compare. The colors are very accurately depicted above. The fabric of the outer layer is standard chiffon and well done. The v-neck front and strappy back are more dressy in appearance, and the sheer skirt is not very sheer, so the overall appearance is more formal than I was anticipating. The main concern for me was size. I am 5'4&#34;, 115 with an avg chest size. I bought size 2. The top portion was slightly loose for me, and the sheer portion of the skirt was too long. The inner skirt is made of very shiny fabric, much shinier than I was hoping for. In my opinion it doesn't work very well with the dress. It looks cheap. The inner portion was also longer on me. On the model, the inner skirt hits at her upper thigh, but for me it was closer to lower thigh. These are obviously fixable changes, but I didn't want to spend money on alterations at 50% the cost of the dress.
B006PGGJOE|5|I bought several of these last year for Christmas.  They were a hit.  This year, I bought one for my son's teacher.  My husband and father-in-law still have theirs.  These are a great gift!!!!
B00GISNHLW|2|Last year we got this hat from buybuyBaby in the 18 month size. This year I figured I'd go for amazon in the 2-4 years since the 18 month size was almost too small. I'm not sure if it's the different source or what, but the hat was totally different. The brim was stiffer in a cheap way. After about 2 wears my daughter managed to rip a huge hole in it. We loved the last iPlay hat, but this one went in the trash.
B00L2OVF0W|5|Amazingly comfortable and you cannot beat the price!
B00E7879QO|5|I wish these came in more colors. There so comfortable
B000JVKXPW|2|I needed a new atomic travel clock this one looked good at a good price. it worked as soon as I put in the battery, found what zone I was in, has a very good display and as i am visually impaired that is a very important plus. BUT a big problem ensued as I arise early and it is dark outside I must have a clock that has a very easy to use back-light. all other travel clocks (5 in all) that I have had has a big button someplace usually right under the display to bring up the light. There is no button on this - the little spot on top which says \\"press\\" does absolutely nothing. so here I was with a clock and no easy back light. I discovered that the light will come on only when i fold the stand that keeps clock up right, this is not very convenient at all. they really mised the boat on such a poor design feature. I would not reccomend this.  thanks
B00GA21R6S|5|Perfect!!!
B004J008ZE|4|Comfortable
B00K5T7HTI|5|This is a good quality sweatshirt especially for the price! It washes well and doesn't shrink. The fabric is color-fast and doesn't<br />bleed unto the lining. I would highly recommend this to others! Order your usual size!
B0027V3H7I|1|Well, for not having any reviews yet you'd think they'd try really hard to get the order right.  I ordered a beautiful white peacock scarf.  I received a gray getto looking sweatshirt jacket?  I have no idea why?  Nothing on my scarf order matched any of the numbers on the jacket.  I now  have to go out of my way and send the thing back and hope that I get the correct item along with   the refund of 2 shipping charges.  Buyers beware until to hear from me again that all is well   with this order.   L. MacDonald
B009W65RT2|5|Love these pants - they're supre comfy and basically a pant jegging. I think they'll look great with a tunic top and short boots for fall!
B000N0Z0WU|5|great
B00Y4O4XCO|5|Awesome slouchie! Very pleased.
B00AE7G7PG|3|Need to loose more weight. Quality is well worth the price. They are quality made and will last a good while.
B00QFBY2KC|3|This t shirt is very cute, but order up a size. It was somewhat small before I washed it, and it shrunk enough in the first wash that it now fits like a small.
B00LODDYY6|3|Runs a bit small, a narrow cut tee.
B00APD1ZTM|1|I had ordered this necklace February 3rd and waited patiently for it to arrive. Soon the estimated delivery date has passed and I waited a couple of days. Nothing. I am wondering where the heck it is and when I will actually get what I paid for. If the object is dented or damage in any way I will be wanting a replacement necklace. If I get the necklace soon after I had emailed the seller then I will change my review. But for now I am dissapointed.
B00ATG54LK|3|I ordered the &#34;Sky Blue&#34; color of the sweater, but I instead recieved the &#34;Blue Multi&#34;<br />Although there is not much of a difference, the &#34;Sky Blue&#34; one has a cutie mark zipper and is a lighter blue than the other one. I decided not to return it since they are practically the same thing.<br /><br />Other than that, it looks exactly like it does in the picture. Just don't expect any awesome zippers.<br /><br />The hoodie is too small, and is always sliding off the head. But the wings are really cool.
B005QR8P4K|4|Shrank quite a bit after washing and line drying.
B006VXBSAG|5|I bought this as a present for my sister, it arrived really fast! And the quality is good, the serigraphs is nice. So it totally worth it
B004AGC0Z8|4|Ok so got the Elf shoes you need a hat.  the only problem was in order to keep it looking like the picture we had to stuff it with plastic bags because paper made to much noise and it didnt look good with bumpy spots but it was a hit.
B0002FHJHU|5|These shirts are great. They are just what I wanted and the sleeves aren't too short.
B000GARHJG|3|The cut is for a more mature person... But comfy... don't wear these for &#34;going out&#34;... These are more for moving day...<br /><br />WARNING: The dye bleeds.... no matter how many times I wash these jeans the color rubs on to hands, seats.... pretty much anything that rubs against them...
B000MX3O2G|5|This bra is the best giving support on the sides as well as the front!
B004TZ971U|5|I can wear this dress at Renaissance Festivals, Halloween, or were ever I want. Fits great and I'm 5'5\\" wear size 6/8.
B00KACUBX4|5|Gift
B00246H7MW|5|I wear daily at work so my clothes don't get dirty. Comfortable and fits good. I have one that is almost three years old. Fabric is durable and lasts a long time.
B001KK941K|5|Hey guys, id like to take the time out of my very important day to tell you about my new G1 case. Its a hard black rubberized case that comes with a touch sensitive hard plastic screen protector. (NO POUCH OR CARRYING CASE INCLUDED LIKE SOMEONE ELSE SAID)<br /><br />Thats what ive been going around saying ever since i got this AMAZING case. too bad it arrived later than the case I got from SF Planet, i had to sport that bulky and squarely made case for the whole weekend i was away.<br /><br />WHY SHOULD I BUY THIS CASE?<br /><br />1. Because i already did your job by buying all the rubberized hard cases on amazon and this one is clearly the best.<br /><br />2. Because if something is wrong with your product they will replace it quickly.<br /><br />3. Its not bulky, the edges are smooth and dont overlap causing some horrible friction as you slide it open.<br /><br />4. It feels good to rub<br /><br />5. look at the reviews<br /><br />6. I said so!<br /><br />BTW, i returned the other case i got from the other manufacturer, it was so cheap and square...i mean its really square like a Scion! This one is curved like a Porsche mmm...so smoothe.<br /><br />I also might pop out the hard plastic screen protector like another reviewer said, its great protection but unresponsive at times.
B00A4XAXG4|5|Very Nice!
B00KKFQW8Y|5|Beautiful sweater. Very nice quality.
B00LG73A26|5|Nice very happy.
B0040M7NLI|5|I love it...
B000VZK3HE|5|These are your nice \\"standard\\" white athletic sock.  Not too light, not too heavy.  Also of note: I wear a size 13 shoe and they fit me wonderfully, so don't worry if you think you might be on the big size for these.
B00A8LPNTY|5|I love the turquoise blue color and it is very sturdy. The rubber like material is great because my ipad doesn't slip off things easily.
B00BBL0ZDE|3|I love the colors of the skirts,but the material and quality of the skirts are very cheap and plastic like. In addition,the skirts are too small.I ordered a x large ,but the skirts fits like a small or medium. Really not to happy with these items.
B00UJDS3DY|5|The product is wonderful. It does what it says..extremely pleased.
B009IQLKLA|4|Great socks especially good for Diabetics.
B00EE30GJY|5|too small
B00SGRYWCG|2|Sent it back. Did not like the fit
B00R5O6Z8K|5|Amazing fast shipping from China. I ordered this product on 7/9/15 with an estimated shipping date of 8/4-8/20, I received this yesterday 7/15/15. Fits snug, yet comfortable. I'm 5'1&#34; 120lbs, just had a baby 3 months ago and the small fits very well.
B00HLSRNGI|3|I bought 4 sets of these for my kids. The day I put them on them, two of the suspender clasps broke apart--on 2 different sets. Changed my entire theme. Very disappointed.
B00OCHXC2K|5|I bought this for my sister for her baby shower however when it came in I had to give it to her early, it's so adorable and she loves it! The fabric is very nice and she washed it already and the colors are still as vibrant.
B002LSI2YK|5|Soft too!  And I do not like ironing so I get it out of the dryer fast enough to just hang and wear, which works wonderfully.<br /><br />I can wear these to work and even had a comment on how slimming they are (I am not, by any means, overweight but I enjoyed the comment :).<br /><br />Anyhow, I recommend these for anyone who would like to be comfortable and professional-looking in a workplace that does not require suits.
B0018OP3M2|5|Very good.
B00N1IUIGY|4|I like the color and slim fit.
B00EJ2RMOW|1|Ordered 3 pkgs size medium.  received 2 packages of small.  didn't see mistake  until I tried to wear a pair, after all shipping materials were disposed of.  kinda angry.
B007N4A2OA|5|This shirt is made extremely well. Made for people with a long torso.  I will be buying more  in the future
B00PK1GUTE|4|Nice
B00JVERAE0|4|not bad
B00MFBV416|4|ITS A VERY nice PRODUCT... IT CAME AS I SPECTED… I RECOMMENDED… QUALITY 95%... WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT ALL 100% OK…
B00B99OK2U|5|I usually buy clothing for ages eighteen months and three years. Wonderful goods arrived. Excellent graphics and everyone is happy with the suits
B00BN4MY06|5|This product is smooth fits nice comfortable flows with your body perfect thank you
B007RUJPJS|5|I am a curvy size 10 and the large fits great! There is plenty of room. It is super flattering and sexy. Somehow it makes me look just like the girl in the pic :)
B00BAHDVWG|5|just what I was looking for
B008CV5F9U|5|This dress is an excellent quality without even considering for such a price. It fits just as measurements indicate. I ordered according to size and fit very well, color is gorgeous. I am completely satisfaced.
B00LP3U678|2|Few cotton garments i have purchased have ever shrunk this much. My XXL's became instant clam-digger/capri pants.    They do look very cool. I have same brand in a pair of shorts that are awesome in both look and fit, but appear to be discontinued :(
B0093IFAQO|5|Bought this for my nephew's 13th birthday.  Originally purchased a large but was too tight.  The XL fit fine.  He absolutely loves it, and everyone thinks he looks great in it!
B00IWJBK50|3|too small
B0037ZDIU4|5|Dickies Gen Flex srcubs are very comfortable and stylish. I work 12 hr shifts and I am able to wear these tops all day every day. I have owned the black for 2 years now and it still looks good after many washes (wash in cold water with color enhancing detergent and tumble dry on low or extra low).  Also I am short (5ft 3) and with wide hips and these shirts work very well.<br /><br />In my 2 years using these scrubs I can't say I have any problems with them. Once you have the right size you are fine. I wear XL and usually use size 14- 16 shirts and use a bra size of 38 DD.
B00LK0LHGA|1|Very disappointed with these pants.  The fabric is so soft, it's like a worn out thick cotton sheet.  There is some sort of stretchy band that makes them comfortable, but have come unsewn on both sides (after resewing once/one side).  Garbage-will look for another brand.
B000L1C8KS|5|Love them!
B00LF5NRBS|5|very nice
B00TJADEZU|5|They fit good 👌👌
B00O7A8ZEW|3|the bottom button slips out of the hole
B005ITTU2M|5|The order was delivered in a timely manner and the product was good quality.  This was a gift for someone who enjoyed it very much. I am 100% satisfied with the seller and the product
B00D83PWE0|5|Based on the reviews, I ordered a Medium, although I normally wear a small or an extra small.  (5'2&#34; 115 lbs)  This fits really well, and is better quality that I had thought. It is not super thin.  Also not super thick, but it's really cute.  I have purchased several items from Allegra K, and it is hit or miss, but usually I am happy with the products, especially for the price!!
B00I3ZOBSQ|4|I am 6'4&#34;, 200#, lean build..fits just right.
B00925JHEY|5|Got this as a Christmas gift for a huge Psych fan, and she loved it. The sizing seems pretty normal compared to other unisex T-shirts.  It didn't shrink after washing.
B00551ORSK|4|there wasn't enough room to get your arm in and over your shoulder
B007GB8LZC|5|Nice
B00JLRHK2Y|5|I found it hard to find a slip that is not like a girdle (tight), yet allows shorter sweater dresses to hang well and not cling from static.  This product is great and comfortable.
B0047O3RCS|2|I wear a 12 pencil skirt and dressy pants but have some extra tummy.  I bought a large in this and nearly passed out trying to get it on.  It's not a silky, smooth fabric like other Dr. Rey shapewear I've bought and really liked.  This is a rough, itchy, thick knitted material.  The panty part seems sized fairly, has much less firming capacity, and is comfortable enough......the top portion is unbearably tight and constrictive and rolls down badly.  I'd reach under my clothes and pull it up with great effort and it was rolling down like a window shade at my first breath or movement.  If I bought another one (I won't), I'd size up at least 2 sizes.  I tried to wear mine Christmas Eve while exchanging gifts with immediate family.  I managed to keep it on about an hour before heading for privacy and yanking it off.  I now have the \\"hold-your-belly-in\\" portion stretched around a huge vintage pickle crock where I am trying to \\"enlarge\\" it to a wearable, bearable size. You get what you pay for.  This was only 13-14 bucks and not worth the the postage or fighting Amazon about a return of a worn undergarment.  Compared to some shapewear, I'd give it a C-.  Compared to other Dr. Rey shapewear, I've give it an F-.
B00DHOEH50|4|This my second purchase. I just needed more because I've misplaced several of the stays in my favorite sizes. These are reliable stays with smooth edges that work well with super magnets.
B00H3AQ9QY|3|liked the dress alot  but since the fabric is teeshirt material it hugs your body like a glove showing every bump and lump so you should order a larger size... did not want the hassle of a return and retry but adorable dress
B000E7DR1S|5|Love these briefs.  Fit is very comfortable, tagless design very nice.  Don't ride or bunch.  Absolutely recommend. I'm a size medium fyi.  Different builds may feel differently.
B00BRJDNGQ|5|Beautiful, delivered on time too
B003Z3GYF4|4|Bought this for my daughter.  It arrived super quick, and fit well and comfortably.  Haven't given it 5stars because I don't know how it washes and wears after use
B007KFZERM|4|, maybe a little large on top panel.  Does not support as well as I hoped but very comfortable.  Would consider buying another color.
B00EB113Q4|5|Fits great, good quality
B00INIW39W|3|Very thick, it is more like a long, received with pungent taste, so I wash it again.
B000FDOPVM|4|My father used to have one of these---really enjoy having one myself.
B0090CKKEK|5|I purchased these to wear with my newly-acquired chiffon dress, which shows everything (as we all know). I am a 34B/36A, so I bought the A size. They pretty much just adhere themselves to your boobs. There is little in the way of support (no jumping jacks) but they look natural, are smooth, stay in place. On the box it reads that you can &#34;place them farther apart to create cleavage&#34; when you pull the snaps together in the front, but I don't see how that would even happen. Overall I am delighted with this purchase.
B00GUBHBRS|5|Got them for a friend she's about 5'4 maybe 120lbs they fit perfectly she's very happy with them
B00EA1CMII|1|Terrible! Color faded in day 1. Zipper ripped. Will return. Total POS.
B00D55C2B2|5|Again, one can't go wrong with anything made by &#34;Ana-Kaci&#34;!  It can be worn for daytime or for special occasions!  A must-have for any woman!
B00LU2PNQS|3|I have several versions of this skirt. This one was very tight at the waist and did not fold over as well as others. Just ok.
B005SW52H6|4|They were a little large but they feel great.  Very comfy and casual.
B00GO0I3E0|4|Quality of this item was excellent. The fit was somewhat smaller than expected. XXL fit like a L in other sweaters.
B00V94D652|1|After the first hour they were so stretched out they were falling off.
B00ELP2VA2|4|Really nice wallet.  Lots of room for cards.  Would be nice if it had two &#34;bill pockets&#34;
B000K5IZY8|1|Bearing in mind that these are supposed to be \\"glove liners\\" one size fits all is grossly inaccurate. I have large hands(9.5 inches around the knuckles), and these are big on me. mainly the fingers which are about 1/2 inch too long!!!! Complete waste of 6 bucks. Very fast shipping though. PS I really hate giving bad reviews.
B005H3BCBQ|5|These were a Christmas gift for my son's girlfriend. He got the Batman socks and she got the Robin ones.  They will be fun when they run.
B00FDH2A9O|5|Fits a bit large but it's very adorbale! Received tons of compliments on it!  Definitely recommend this one :D
B007OWEMXS|5|Wonderful fit.  I love it.  I am very satisfied.  I will order more when I can.  Everyone should be satisfied
B00OCDEDYA|4|Love them and they are super cute. I love the pocket. It's a great place to put my phone and Chapstick. I was worried it would be a little low and my chord on my earphones would be too short but it was perfect. The top is a little loose causing me to pull them up as I run.
B004YZO4Q8|1|These jeans are great, worth five stars, when they are actually as described.  We ordered these jeans based on the the description of 98% Cotton 2% Elastane.  However, the jean that were sent to us were 100% cotton, with no stretch.
B00LO0GMN4|5|Fits as expected.  Arrived on time.  Very satisfied with purchase.  Will purchase make more purchases in the future.
B00NMYEYTY|4|nice soft scarf, gift from my little girl so I of course I love it!
B00WZXMAVW|5|Very nice - just the right length.
B005GYGEWS|5|These leggings are super comfortable and soft. Loved them from the moment I put them on. Good fit, too. I'm short and sometimes the capri leggings are too long but these are just right for me.
B005RBGNEO|5|These bras fit older women much better than anything else I've found  The cups do a very good job and keeping everything where it should be.  I will be looking for more!
B005MZX77Q|5|ok
B009BOQEAG|5|The scarf is soft and med-warm--perfect for spring. The range of colors make it possible to wear with a wide range of colors, from pink to purple to black.The varied texture and poms make it fun. I bought it as a highlight for a plain shirt and it works well. I look forward to it keeping my neck warm with my raincoat.
B005QQTN0Q|5|I was looking some ankle socks that were not white, so I could wear them with casual or dressy flats (and not look like a 1950s schoolgirl), and these fit the bill. I'm a size 7.5\\" shoe and these fit like a glove, but if you wear a larger size shoe they may be too short. The material is thin enough to fit under flats, but substantial enough to prevent blisters so far. I also like that it's a big pack all of the same color; so as some inevitably go missing in the wash, I won't have to worry too much about miss-matched pairs. I think they'd be cute with heels too, the texture is similar to a very thick pair of tights. I've worn them with sneakers too. All in all I'm very happy with them.
B00OHW0FJI|3|Great shirt but it is way to big to be a medium.  Maybe fits a xl
B001OAFFDC|5|This brown \\"smooth\\" eyeglass case fit my \\"readers\\" perfectly, is well made and sturdy, and the dark brown color is great.  I would expect to do business with this company again in the near future.
B00N9OE3K2|2|Gorgeous dress but not made for someone with curves.
B007YFEFDW|5|Received lots of compliments from others (particularly kids) at the local Turkey Trot.  Item shipped promptly and was as described.
B00PK9K7Y0|2|Too small and I'm tiny!
B00NZII9AM|4|The color is great and the material is comfortable and lightweight,  but the fit was smaller than expected.  It's also a little shorter than I'm used to.  Most of my other blazers are 2-3 inches longer at least.
B001HP8M9I|2|read the description carefully - the nightgown is repeatedly described as flannel, but once it mentions that is is \\"polyflannel.\\"  I just got it, and the tag says 100% polyester.  My fault for not reading more carefully - I was looking for natural fiber pjs for my daughter with sensitive skin.
B004DNVP40|4|Got it for my husband and he likes them!
B00JM8RCZM|4|I LOVE the design ,however, it was shorter than I expected. Very cute nontheless!
B00LBWUZGU|1|Florescent pink! Runs smaller than size chart says.
B00BUKO06O|5|My granddaughter wanted bermuda shorts to wear to school.  They were hard to find in stores.  she had resorted to cutting off some of her jeans, much to her mom's dismay.  Found these and was very pleased with quality and fit.
B004SWJ5DO|3|Nice quality but somewhat small. I returned.  Was also concerned about color transfer.
B00J8YFSCY|4|Wasn't too soft, but it looks nice and it fits nicely, my size is 8 and I got the 0-10 size.
B00RLUB45M|3|It's ok for those who want to be super sexy in the workplace. I was looking for something a little more like a suit skirt. It is a little too great of a fit. You can see the line of my buttcrack this thing is so tight and elastic! It looks fabulously sexy but I am looking for a much more conservative look. Not workplace acceptable in my world, but would be for others. Would be better suited for bedroom role play!
B00BW9AO3Q|5|Very nice!
B009S2HIL0|2|Shirt was to be a medium ladies. Shirt is very small must be returned. I was not happy with the time it took to receive.
B00F003O1W|5|This scarf is just as pictured.  It's nice and comfy.. best part..no irritating little strings hanging down but it helps keep me warm.  I'm wearing it right now!
B00KCXGF18|5|Very nice fit. I use these for scuba diving..  They do run a bit large.  I bought XXL based on reviews.. I am 5'7&#34; and full figured and I could have gone down to a XL for a more snug fit I think.  High waisted, Long legs, lightweight material and a bit stretchier than I expected, but all in all these are very nice.. I will probably order another pair in the next size down.
B00QKF40CS|5|Cute
B00EP6SZWK|5|Good quality for a great price!  The scarves are really silky and have good color.  Definitely worth purchasing these items.
B005G4GOK0|5|This is a gift for my DH for Christmas. I love that the fabric is soft and that the color is a soft grey. I can't wait for him to open it!
B007H0RA9K|5|Love it!  The quality of the T-Shirt is high end!  It was for my daughter and she was very happy.
B00RV94OU0|1|Ordered the biggest size, couldn't even get it on. Sizes are inhuman.. you need to have a 3-inch long torso to fit into this; it was so ridiculously short
B00URFJMLQ|5|Just right
B00CMPW284|4|The skirt is really nice, hold you in, etc.  Just it is so dark it really looks black not navy.
B00JAJCEGU|3|the shirt is not the quality I expected for the price. It also looks to run very small but wont know if it fits till after christmas
B007R6AQ9K|4|Pretty comfortable. A little on the snug side, but no big deal. Would recommend to a friend, fan or anyone else who loves the show.
B00DY8QG9E|5|Nice bra for the bigger ones
B004UM7YUS|2|The fedorad hat is adorable, just how the picture described it. But I searched &#34;Kids Fedoras&#34; and the hat is huge for a child.
B002M3TKPY|4|This was my 3 year old grandson's reward for potty training. It did the trick. He couldn't wait to wear<br />all his different superhero underwear. Only drawback...the pictures are on the butt, so he<br />likes to wear them backwards. That was he can see them. WORKS FOR ME !<br />Gramma Julia
B0047HNZ2W|4|This hat is quite soft and comfortable. It is sized well and is well made.  The brim is narrower than most Fedoras. It is almost more of a Derby than a Fedora. The tacky medallion can be removed with a pair of wire clippers.  However, you then have to deal with the glob of glue that held it to the hat.
B00PVAHWFU|5|Love this top, the only complaint and that not a lot of variety come in XL
B00RFCW478|4|Very sexy. Fitted to the shape of your body. Flattering. Need to wear an undergarment slip not to see panty line. Needs to be tied tight to get the right view in the chest area. Color is bright.
B0055X1O0C|5|I love this suit! I recently had a C-section and emergency abdominal surgery. I wear a body suit just to feel put together and not so flabby. This suit fits great and has wide straps that don't dig into my shoulders. The main perk is the fabric. The fabric isn't shiny or &#34;slick&#34; so jeans, pants etc. don't sag off my body or move dramatically when I bend over. It also comes up higher in the armpits. I'm going to buy another one for a spare - its that much better than my other ones.
B00IE087EO|5|nice
B004IOXHTU|2|I don't know how they thought the dual seams would be comfortable, but it does NOT work with curves AT all.  It does unfortunate things to the crotch area...  :(  I even ordered a size larger than normal because I wanted something that would fit comfortable and with ease under jeans.
B005PG8IJY|5|Love it! Got it in the mail today and it's generally awesome. The metal is thick so I don't have to worry about it bending and the chain is just the right length. Love it!
B0008EOASG|5|tight up the crotch when sitting.
B00AO0B6H2|5|My granddaughter loves it and it looks very pretty and girly with the seahorse in glitter.  The size is right and the material good.
B001T9O51G|5|Just what we wanted.
B00AZJ6TKQ|5|Very pleased!
B00KNBLNKC|5|Bought as a gift. Was delivered on time and fit as expected. They loved the logo!
B00AIIQJP4|3|Quality was so bad.
B00PBDRGUI|5|My grandson is very happy with these pajamas.  They are very soft and fit well.  I bought a size appropriate for his age and the fit is just right.
B00BIH2SCM|3|Wonderful quality jacket, but the sizing was very small. I am normally between an XL and an L, but the XL of this jacket wouldn't even zip.
B00D9MOJPI|5|This is a great outfit! Fit our granddaughter great and easy to wash and wear….Colors are bright and pretty, material is soft - not scratchy
B0067VNDVY|5|I've been buying the cheap Chinese no-names. The Russel and Champion brands are the best bang for the buck.  Spend the extra 5-10 bucks and get something that'll last. The cheaper shirts just feel like stretchy tissue paper.
B00CW7QRA6|2|The design is nice, but the sweater is thin and not as roomy as sweaters normally are. Luckily, my son is very thin and we live on the West Coast, but it would not fit a heavier child, or be useful in harsher weather. Old Navy has done a much better job at comparable prices.<br /><br />Don't waste your money...
B00KH0WZV0|5|My son is a big Comic Book Fan. He really likes Deadpool and Spiderman. I am really surprised by the quality. It isn't some cheap Walmart graphic T-Shirt it's a legit Marvel Shirt and for all the moms out there I washed it in cold water and dried it in the dryer and still looks good. Did not shrink or look used after the first wash like cheap graphic shirts from certain stores.
B007R1OMAY|3|Love the design of this shirt; the fabric is very nice - soft (maybe too much for a guy) and the shirt itself is well made.  However,  I ordered a large for a guy that's actually closer to a medium and it was way too small.  It would've fit me (usually a female size medium t-shirt) without being oversized.  And, the one I received had major defective printing with black lines through the whole logo.  So, it was returned - and NOT reordered.  Sad to say.
B005IK6DMQ|4|Mundo Unico makes some great underwear. While the thong design is comfortable and unobtrusive the part where the string and the cup meet could be smoothed a little in their cotton thongs as that area can potentially rub after an active day.
B003LBTB5U|4|I bought these because I wanted to exercise more, get in shape, and needed to prevent chafing.  They are sized properly and stay in place.  I don't have many compression shorts, so I don't know if they are the absolute best or not.  However, I am pleased with the shorts and believe it is definitely a 4 star product, maybe 5.
B00UDS1B2K|5|Awesome shirt, it is very HI VISIBILITY lettering on this shirt, very impressed. Would recommend to anybody looking for a good duty shirt. I will be purchasing more of these.
B00178IVKK|3|I ordered 3 pairs of earrings at once.  With one pair, the posts came off as soon as I removed the earrings from the packaging (the \\"cardboard\\" the earrings are mounted on).  The other two pair are still intact.  I worry & handle them gingerly and don't wear them as often as I would have if I didn't fear the posts would come off.  Otherwise, nice earrings!  The look so pretty with my hawaiian clothes.
B001IYLW7W|5|These little clogs are perfect for up-to-date style for babies!  They're perfect with socks to keep feet warm and protected and look so cute with outfits.  A really affordable way to complete baby's outfit.
B00NXX0TOI|4|Nice shirt. Bought an 2x fit like an 3x
B00AESCSQM|4|I love levis especially the boyfriend jeans, but these seemed like they are cut really narrow instead of roomier like the way theboyfriend cut should be. keeping that in mind
B003VWDBI2|5|This jacket is PERFECT!  I absolutely love it. Its very durable and easy to maintain. I recommended it to all of my friends and they all agreed.
B00N4N1U86|5|Fit as expected
B00BIUVQZ4|2|very small again wanted for a display , didn't know that they were that small, picture looked bigger did not notice the size
B0013O4D9G|3|Nude ones are not nude. More like light grey. I've bought Nubras before so I know what nude should look like. Other than that they're still great.
B004Z30NAU|4|Very comfortable!
B005HW980Y|5|This product is soooooo cuteeeee!<br />I really loved it!<br />I bought to use as a costume in the easter day.
B009P4HX3O|5|This will make my wife so happy.  She is a Lucy nut, and Valentines Day is coming. One gift down two too go
B00JAB5H3K|1|One seam was slightly torn out of the package, but I figured I could mend that so I tried them anyhow. They stayed in place for about half an hour and were alright during that time although the edges of the lace were scratchy. After that, they rolled up and would not stay in position. It's too bad they don't work well because they are really cute, but I'll be going back to the much more reliable and comfortable slip-shorts.
B0083QNPC8|4|Bought it for my wife she said it fit well and was good quality.
B001F5UZ4A|3|It was not comfortable when worn under clothing, which was the only way it was safe to wear in Italy and Spain.  Hard to access.
B0007OX9PW|5|Bought this dress for two months from now.<br />I am in fact a size Large and bought it according to the size chart which is a tight fit, but I plan on buying some Great Shape pantyhose (or a girdle) to go with this to flatten out my belly and love handles. I really do need to loose a couple of inches on my waist anyway.<br />I have tried junior sizes before and know when it is a junior size just because I literally cannot get my waist through it. I can fit into this dress just fine though. And I didn't want to go up a size because the dress ranges longer when I want short. So I stuck with the Large.<br />Before buying this dress I was 165 lbs., 44 thighs, 38 hips, 33 waist. Now I am 160, 43 thighs, 37 hips and 32 waist. I plan on loosing a few more inches. I'm also 5 foot 9 inches, and for my age I am only 10 pounds over weight.<br />As for the bust area, I'm a 38 tipping to 40 but love to show my cleavage, however I'm falling out the sides instead of the front, so I'll most likely buy a bolero button jacket to go with this to hide my girls when they're hanging on the sides.<br />All-in-all, if it weren't for my love handles and pouch, which I have been fighting for years to get rid of, I would look drop dead gorgeous in this dress. And with getting the red dress, and my big butt, my rear looks just like an apple and is gorgeous. (But even from behind I still look off from my love handles.)
B0093KTQE4|4|Way too small but not knowing how corsets fit that was my fault but I did learn if you wear a 14-16 then when buying a corset you usually need to order a 3X.
B00WNE8OZ4|1|Fits like a medium
B00E1CQYWG|3|Nice shirt but the sizes are not right. I got a 5x but when I got it the shirt was closer to 2x.
B00BXEZQTM|5|This is a really beautiful and light weight scarf!  I absolutely Love the colors (I got the peach) and the material!!!
B00IF69J7G|5|I love this top. Washed well, very good fabric and a perfect fit.
B00P68I238|5|I can wear the hood with my glasses!!  It'll be great for winter!
B002PMVN0W|1|Ordered the fuchsia Nordic socks but was sent burgundy Tibetan socks.  Called to request correct socks to be sent. Received another pair of the Tibetan socks. Am returning both pairs and giving up on receiving the Nordic socks.
B00EJLV8T8|4|I love Hipsy headbands, so comfortable and adjustable, I just didn't like the color of this one, the picture on Amazon didn't match what I received exactly.
B00KEAZ8RQ|5|Perfect fit. I have a medium body build and it fits every part of my waist. Good for any size :)
B008S3BMHG|5|It is perfect. I love it, I want to buy more.
B00VC8ZYKU|5|I love it! I thought It was going  to fit me long long because I'm 5'1 but I was wrong it fits me perfectly fine and it's not that much of see through I ordered this on the color beige.
B00I3D5WMM|4|My son loves his backpack. He is in kindergarten, so only a couple things go into it everyday. I did notice the lining between the large and small pockets is starting to tear. Wish it was more sturdy.
B0053X5FI6|5|beautiful and touch well
B00A1VYCFM|5|This fleece scarf is longer than standard allowing it to be worn in a greater variety of ties. It is very warm and comfortable.
B000Q7P8AY|5|i give it a 5 because it is smoking hot and looks great on most figures great price to. very durable.
B00EROP3XO|4|This is a great hoodie!!! I got it to replace my fave DC hoodie that has a broken zipper!!! Wish this one was a little longer in length & sleeve, but still great!!!
B009X1R9PQ|4|Fits my skinny 40 pound 6 year old. A bit of swooshy noise when moving. He used them for in between weather this spring for soccer practice.
B005GSYHFA|5|Great jeans.Great price. Available in off sizes not found in stores.
B000A38O0A|5|its a wig
B00JZSKZQW|4|This is a cute dress/tunic for summer/layering. The fabric is very thin and has a lot of 2-way stretch (horizontal not vertical) as well as generous smocking in the waist so it worked for me as I am big busted, also the split v neckline is sewn about three inches up so it is fairly modest as well. The length is pretty much as pictured, so it could be worn as a dress as shown but as it is so thin unless you have a body you are wanting to flaunt you will likely want to layer it. I wore it with a spanx camisole and leggings for a tunic to work and received several compliments. The only reason I gave a four star and not a five is the fabric is not very durable and snags easily so I don't anticipate it lasting forever but otherwise it is exactly what I was hoping for. Love the colors & pattern!
B00FS4Z3GY|5|daughter loved it!
B0050CCMEA|5|Exactly as expected.  Perfect
B009AE2O92|5|Easy to use
B00G36EDZI|5|Excelent
B00HQZ4ZWG|5|Great
B00FR4LXE6|5|tank top was described as said in details and shipping was fast! will recommend!
B004XFGJEO|5|My daughter loves this Jacket. I feel 100% satisfied with the purchase at Amazon.
B00R39UDGM|5|So cute. Fit as expected.
B002NPCIOQ|4|My son just turned 2. I purchased size 2-3t. They will not for him for too long.
B001L990R8|4|I have a short athletic build...about 5'5 145lb. I medium fits perfectly. I actually ordered previously a small and the shirt was well-fitted until I washed and it became a &#34;kid's&#34; shirt. Very soft; kinda of thin...this probably isn't going to last years if you wear it all the time.
B00BWA72S0|5|The girlfriend bought this, as she found that it was eye-catching but not too flashy. According to her, it's great in the summertime, being quite breathable. Guys seem to leer at her whenever she wears this, a fact that makes her happy. I don't mind; I'm proud to have a girl who's a hot commodity.<br /><br />Details about the girlfriend: 5' 6\\" leggy redhead with freckles (not ugly). She got the Size 4. Looks good on her.
B00ISRCCMQ|4|never worn out
B001CCN6WY|5|Great coat  at a great price
B0009PX3WI|4|The quality is excellent.  The fit is a little big, but that is ok. I am sure I will grow into it!
B00KF1J7J4|5|This is a beautiful coat. I love that it's reversible since the patterned interior is very warm. My daughter is an 18 pound 6 month old and it fits over her little outfits nicely.
B009NFPTGS|5|EXCELLENT
B002C4W0IW|5|It was perfect.
B00BRLGDRU|4|Love it
B008D2JFIA|5|the top does fit small but the bottom is a little small<br />orver all love it
B004444MBQ|4|I purchased this for my wife, and I thought since it was made with recycled denim that it would be a little thicker than regular cotton, but its really just a nice cotton shirt.  I love the shirt on my wife, but honestly I think its a little overpriced for just a cotton t-shirt without any textured designs and nothing on the back.
B00GYTJWX2|4|I'm absolutely in love with this blazer! It's a little snug on my shoulders when I reach forward with my arms, but that doesn't bother me. It's a really bright color, exactly what it looks like & everyone complimented me on it. It also comes with a really cute hairtie with a bow on it.
B0006I3TYK|5|Everythink  was ok, thanks a lot.......
B0088X2DAQ|5|No rolling down your waist area! I like this girdle because it has the rubber around the high-waist band to prevent the brief from moving. That's the main reason, above anything else, why it's my favorite support brief. I'm 5'2.5&#34;, 190lbs., I'm butty or pear shape, I wear between 14W or 16 reg. in clothing. I wanted more support around my puggy tummy, so I purchased (2) Large girdles, from Walmart ($12.99). I know the XL would fit as well, but I wanted more support. It's not to tight and the material has some substance, so it's not going to loose its shape fast. It doesn't dig into your skin or leave that noticible bulge under your bra area. I pull mines all the way up to ensure that doesn't occur.<br /><br /> It smoothes your bumps out - lol! You will love this brief as soon as you put it on.
B00569QC6Q|1|I like Hanes briefs and have worn them for years. I was looking for lower profile briefs and saw these described as \\"mid-rise\\" so I gave them a try. In fact, they are larger-cut and sit higher on the hips than the regular briefs. Unfortunately, I did not see this until I opened the package, thus obviating any return to the seller, Easy-Fit Brands. Oddly enough, EasyFit authorized a return based on my statement that \\"they do not fit well at all\\" then rejected the return, sending back the original package with a highlighted \\"return policy\\" which stated no open packages of underwear could be returned. In truth, I probably should have known this ahead of time, but I presumed they actually read my request before approving it.
B007SK4C7C|4|Since most lingerie is very small I bought a bigger size (3x/4x), it fit pretty well and was very comfortable. The only problem was the straps were way too big and I am a size 38DDD.
B00CXK97KE|5|My son does not like real bulky coats. It looks good on him also I like that this coat could be a nice casual coat for boys to dress up or down in. Its warm, nice to wear on a cold day and can be worn with and without a sweater. ........NICE
B00PRFJW1G|4|Fast delivery, eye-catching design, nice fit and the double layer is great for cold weather. Couple issues: there is no fabric label or laundry instruction so I have no idea what the cardigan is made of and how to care for it, there is also no extra button as a spare one in case any of the buttons goes missing. Overall, good value for the money.
B000PBEU9G|1|I ordered this product looking at the pictures, but through my own neglect i did not read the fine print.  There are only 4 in the package.  I was very disappointed.  I contacted the seller and returned the item, but I have not received a refund yet.  I don't think I will get one.  I was very disappointed over all in the purchase.
B00JYW18GA|5|very thick , warm and soft. Great item! 1/2 the price of other robes of this quality!
B0112VO4Y8|1|Looking good,but made in Haiti.On Donald Trump website everything PROUDLY made in USA
B00IT3GR3Y|4|They look great and fit great. No complaints so far! I hope they stay that way once I wash them.
B004LKDFKM|4|This is a terrific-looking shirt. I got the white background. (I wore it to a Hawaiian-themed wake for a friend who wanted a party instead of a funeral.) The workmanship, artwork, fit and feel were all excellent. If a Hawaiian shirt can be classy, this one is.
B00KWOPSY2|4|Darker than is shows in photo but still a nice hat
B008WYFR0Y|5|I am having a love affair with this tunic. I am 5'9&#34; and 140 pounds and ordered the large, because I wanted to be sure the tunic was long enough to wear with leggings - I have a horror of tunics that barely cover my butt.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the fit! It's fashionably baggy, not like wearing-a-potato-sack baggy, and I love the cream-colored lace inserts in the shoulder. The tunic falls a few inches below my derriere, so plenty of coverage. I really like the way the ribbon that comprises the rabbit is sewn on, too. The ribbon is maybe an inch-inch and a half wide and it's sewn on right down the middle of the ribbon in &#34;swirls&#34; that resemble flowers. The neckline -is- wide, but it doesn't fall off my shoulders. When I wear this tunic to work, I have to wear a bandeau bra so I don't have to adjust it not to show my bra straps all day. Outside of work, I just wear a bra that coordinates with a coordinating tank top as well and it's fine.<br /><br />The quality of the red material is delightful, too! It's really soft, stretchy t-shirt material; it's thinner than sweatshirt material but thicker than regular old t-shirt material, and I think that gives it a special versatility.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the ribbon that came on it is fraying a very little bit right out of the package. What I did is I touched up those fraying spots with superglue, then after they dried fully i carefully snipped off the frayed bits with little scissors and touched up with a drop of superglue again. I haven't washed it yet for this very reason, but when I do I will wash by hand in the sink and rinse gently. I wouldn't leave this wet for a long time cause the red might bleed into the cream-colored shoulder stripes.<br /><br />Overall, a GREAT buy for the money. I love this shirt and it is easy for me to overlook the imperfections. I get tons of compliments whenever I wear it!
B00DMIWC30|5|Fits well & received it earlier than expected.<br />Thanks
B000MPJZB8|1|socks too large and bulky for a woman (in the foot).  the size around the ankle were fine, but too large to fit into size 8 woman's shoe for my 93 yo mom
B00BN4OIPK|5|I own over a dozen thongs, this one by far is my favorite! The band is soft and the material for the rest is incredibly soft! I'm well endowed and have issues with the pouches of some other brands being to small, but the pouch on this one holds everything in place quite well without being too constricting!! Liked it so much, bought another in Turquoise and Red!
B003DSIESQ|5|I really like this product...I got yesterday...every 1 said it's the most beautiful one among all the customs.<br />BUT...I didn't know that the standard size is so huge for me.<br />I am 170 cm with 75 kilos...std size is big for me...but I will take care of that...please..make different sizes for people.
B00B8KZK06|4|Nice from China so the quality is okay but the price is right this will be a nice addition to a summer wardrobe
B00IZQ04Q6|3|A little about my body type:<br />5'7&#34;<br />34 A<br />135 LB<br /><br />I purchased the orange top for a Halloween costume in a small. When I pulled it out of the packaging I automatically knew it was thin fabric. I thought it was going to be too small but when I put it on it was perfect and stretchy. It came about 2-3 inches below my bra line. The only down side is how thin it is. You can see a bra underneath and the outlines of the bra. Luckily I'm wearing a flannel over it so you can't really tell. I would order this shirt again but in a darker color so my bra wouldn't be so obvious.
B00377NHPS|5|This nightgown is everything I hoped it would be.  High quality and very sexy.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00K55IMPK|2|Nice hat but I ordered a red one and it arrived bright pink.
B00LTQV7TC|1|Was just as stupid & uncomfortable as I figured it'd be
B00NPO46UI|1|Didn't look anything like the picture.
B00CMC1WGA|1|I am size 10 and this belt does not stay straight, it rolls down. Do not buy if you are above size 5?
B00D5CXJJE|1|Um, a Hannukah menorah has 8 candles plus the shamash (the center candle).  This is a standard menorah which is for each day of the week.  The picture even looks like something is missing!
B002Q8ENAC|2|I read all the reviews and decided to order it in the brown because of several 'great color' reviews on the brown color.  They must have changed their fabric & fur on this brown because it's nothing other than a dark chocolate color.  YUK  The color & fur look nothing like the brown shown.  The coat fits very nicely and I'm sure it would be just what I was looking for except for the dull dark brown look of it.
B00EPM13MI|5|Just as described!
B00N039Q22|5|The package arrived much earlier than I had expected and when I opened it I absolutely loved it. Its such a bright color and has very neatly done thread work. I love the way it fits too. Usually with shopping online, I hardly find the right fit but this was perfect and looks beautiful. For the price its a must buy. I am sure to buy the color colors as well.
B007C4GJJ8|3|They seem cozy.  However, they get tattered within one wear!
B00550PYH4|5|I been looking for a wirefree DD bra for a long time and this is the most comfortable and supportive ones I have found.
B009REO704|5|Really love the feel and look of this jacket!  Fits as I expected.  Looks great!  I've gotten so many compliments!
B0032OG06E|4|Typical Carhartt quality and durability, while still being stylish enough for a business-casual environment.<br /><br />I had to go up to a 34&#34; waist on these from my usual 33&#34; as they ran a lot more snug than the other pants that I own.  In a 34&#34; the thighs and seat are a bit looser than I would like, but the waist fits fine.<br /><br />I tend to wear a pair of paints 2-3 times before washing them as long as I kept them clean, however, I find that these tend to crease or wrinkle fairly easily from sitting.  They are a stiffer material that likes to hold the form it's been in more than to relax and release.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with these pants as I needed something more durable than Hager Life Khaki's or Dockers.
B003AU5WJQ|4|I generally wear double XL t-shirts but the shoulders are a little big. Not a big deal with a t-shirt but with these long sleeved t-shirts the arms were about 2&#34; too long. I sent these back and ordered the same shirts in XL. I like the quality, the material was comfortable.The only caveat is I haven't washed them to see how they hold or can't speak to repeated use over a longer period.
B008WZCJQS|3|Thin fabric
B00OBBPUB8|5|This is it.  The BEST bathing suit top out there.  This top for perfectly.  Just loose enough to hide the imperfections, but not so loose that it floats up in the water.  Pretty good support for the girls and has held up through several washes.  Buy it!
B0009I4JEG|5|This is one of the most comfortable bras I have ever owned. I usually wear a 38C, but I was sized at Nordstroms, and they suggested a 38D. It fits great - I have bought 2 more...
B000WNVSN8|3|It fits around your wrist.  Nothing extra exciting but I do like it.  I wear it around about 2 or 3 times a week.  The only negative thing I would say is that it starts to unravel slightly sometimes.  I just use scissors and trim up the threads though.  So other than that, which is easily remedeed, it's pretty decent.
B00ITUHNEO|5|I usually wear Medium-Large for jackets. So thought I'd be safe with the large to have a comfy style. I was glad I got the large. Really like that it's lightweight for a/c places in Hawaii.  Nice neutral color to dress up t-shirts and casual tops.
B005GYGEXM|5|Good
B006SFRMN4|2|These thermal bottoms run quite small-----at 118 pounds I ordered a medium and could not wear them comfortably----I would not select them again.
B000AQI1B4|1|This set is made of thin scratchy cheap fabric!  There is no shape to the gown...AWFUL!
B00O7BZ8Y6|4|This dress is soooo pretty. I thought when I took it out the package it was too small but when my daughter tried it on it fit nicely.
B00H8PP1OK|5|I work in a very old building and it gets cold.  These gloves were perfect to warm up my hands yet let me keep working.  Lightweight material but comfy.  Nice neutral color I could wear anytime.
B00960QYPK|2|Very disappointed in the quality of material.  All the dress we bought from this company had problem's with the quality of material some of the dresses you could not even iron the wrinkles out of them.
B007S07NFA|3|the 100% cotton is waaay better than the silk thingies from the same brand.  it gets sweat well and dosent look cheap like the generic paisley ones i got used to
B00917OYPA|4|Great for under skirts and dresses in the summertime in Arizona.  Keeps skin from rubbing raw from the Heat here.  Comfortable and cool cotton ~ Cotton keeps you cool and comfortable.
B00LLX2A3K|3|I am a small woman and this &#34;medium&#34; felt tight on me..I can't imagine myself in a &#34;large&#34;, so I plan to return it..
B008PZ3KYA|4|The boys tuxedo arrived on time and in fine condition.  I would have preferred a tie that he could learn with, but the 'pre-tied' one will suffice.
B006PHTIFA|5|This is a great rain jacket. I like that it's a little longer so it covers your bum and upper thighs. It has sufficient pockets, sometimes missing in ladies' coats. And the color is really, really cool. I would agree with the other reviews that it runs a little small. I ordered a medium instead of a small and I'm glad I did.
B00550PUNC|5|like
B00I0ZZ7X2|5|I love orange for this summer and this dress is so comfy...I recieved lots of compliments on it.  Must Have!
B00DZUN91O|3|Runs small and tight up top, the bottom is perfect. I wish it was more stretchy like material up top. Because of the way the top fits don't know to recommend going 2 sizes bigger
B00LN4O26A|2|size runs to small
B008SDCPC2|5|I loved it! Perfect for Spring/Autumn breeze! Unique style and beautiful color...much, much better then expected it to be! Of course it is not a super high quality material but look at the price!!!!
B00D6KJ1EW|5|It is exactly as pictured.  It holds my cell phone perfectly.  I don't think it would hold a smart phone though.  I have never purchased anything before that was so just like pictured!
B009MI6NIE|5|In the words of the Amazing, Immortal William McDowell:  &#34;I won't go back / I can't go back / to the way it used to be.&#34;
B00LUOV7UW|5|Love this! Easy to tightened yourself. Zipper on the side. There is a flap underneath where the lacing is- thick enough so skin won't show even if the lacing is more than 4inches from completely closing the corset. I bought XL because of the current reviews. 36d cup/ waist 33/34  not low in the front, good coverage. Fabric is very nice. Price is great! I bought more expensive ones n this buy is gonna make me buy more for less!
B003UO31XG|5|US made.<br />It looks like it is real leather, at least by the smell and feel of the material.<br /><br />They fit great and they look awesome.
B00NFFG03I|4|The dress was Great and fits well...Just a little short for me, I am 5'9&#34;...I can manage and it will work...
B004LVONRU|5|This is my first review, but I had to comment on this dress.  I purchased this for my out of town granddaughter, and up to this point I had only seen her and the dress in pictures (lots of pictures).  My granddaughter came for a visit and packed this dress.....how beautiful! It came out of her suitcase in perfect wearable condition. The dress is well made, washes and dries wonderfully (no ironing) and keeps its shape with no wrinkling.  A great party dress, although she wears it almost every day.  I would consider it perfect for any occasion. By the way it is a tea length dress and very true to size.
B0050AFXDY|5|They are t-shirts.  Nothing fancy but they fit true to size, are nice and soft, and most importantly, they are cheap.<br /><br />Good purchase
B00NWJEOF8|1|I want xs
B00L70JJBS|3|Shirt is tiny as you would expect. Ties in the front. Has elastic to create edge ruffles.
B000SKNY00|5|These socks are just what I was looking for. They fit great, feel great, and don't fall down - even when running, etc.
B0030L1WJ4|3|It was a pretty scarf, just not very soft or warm.  It looks just like the picture.  Wearable as an accent, but not for warmth.
B00553XOAU|5|I am 72yrs old and this bra fits likes I was made just for me.  I can wear it all day and it still feels great.  I have never said that about another bra in all these years.  It is about time for a bra like this.  Love it.  Would recommend it to women who have had trouble finding the right bra.  Not only for exercise, but keeps me from &#34;moving around&#34; during a regular day.
B00K93JT7I|5|Was to small broke baby's heart got it fast throw 5 stars to that
B00EBGHZ2U|5|I bought the headband for a little girl's birthday and she loved it.
B00B2SCW6Y|5|I love this bra! Not only sexy but very comfy!!!!
B00NJSBKKO|5|Bought it for my nephew's Birthday. Nephew loves it!
B003ILM7EU|5|Okay for reference I'm 5'7 and 130 pounds with DDD boobs.<br />I ordered a medium even though I usually wear a small in clothing, I have a long torso and I wanted to be on the safe side. Reviews say this is super low in the front and with my giant boobs I was expecting this to be way too low cut to be wearable in public. It's cute! Definitely not too low cut to wear out. It shows some cleavage but with DDD boobs I can't really help that. On a girl with a smaller chest this will be super cute and not SUPER revealing. Cute with shorts, skirts, anything!
B00CUNQS60|5|I NEVER FIND THIS EXCELLENT PRODUCT IN A LOCAL STORE AT THIS PRICE.  THIS BRAND IS VERY GOOD AND IS THE FAVORITE MODEL OF US
B00734M0RM|5|Everyone cheered when she opened the gift.
B00RXMRRTA|5|Absolutely beautiful, Shipping was fast!! look just like the pic!! plus i got party perk coupons:)
B00HY65OAO|1|The picture has been updated since I posted my original observation.  The origianl picture had a shirt with Roman Numerals for 47.  It was pretty funny.
B00FHKL8R2|4|It's loose and sort of fits like a pajama dress, but still pretty cute~ The material is pretty thin and good to wear in the summer.
B00M2OXXOC|4|Very cute, but was huge on our 8 pound newborn. Will probably fit a 3-6 month baby great.
B00W5PLFVG|1|Had to give it away. I even got a size up and it still was way too small.
B00Q42OJ9Q|4|Very nice dress, the sizes come small . For more comfort order one size bigger
B00APYRR4I|5|These slacks feel and look expensive.
B00CGV6E7O|5|great!
B001BEE348|2|I orders a infant and a youth size hat for my two kids.  I should have ordered the child size instead of the infants because the youth size adjusts to almost as small as the infants.  The child size might adjust even smaller than the infant size? Then I would get more use out of it.  I also wish it had the mesh panel like the youth one does.
B00LMUO6XE|5|A China item LOVED THEM , the sizing was different because they are smaller people so my shoes a size 8 pin I needed the extra large
B002IRNFPK|5|Worked perfectly with my Halloween costume. Just had to adjust the size a bit for a smaller foot.
B0081P6L8G|3|Ok quality, but the mask was waaaay to big, don't know who has a head that big. I would give the suit itself 4 stars, but the plastic parts(mask, gloves, boot covers) were really poor quality, definitely made in China. And the belt sucks big time, it won't stay attached and keeps on falling. This suit is great, if you have a girlfriend ready to do some knitting for it!
B00RZPX21M|5|thin but covers the arms well for a bit of added warmth
B0061Q32Z2|5|great
B00UM9FSEM|5|The baby was tiny and the hat too big for hospital pix. It will be perfect for 3 months +
B00JSAURLA|3|The waistband does NOT hold up! I was banking on the waistband holding up the rest of the pant and it doesn't. I pantsed myself several times on a business trip to South Africa with these.<br /><br />So either order a size down or get some safety pins and don't wear heels and pants yourself.
B0002NYN2Q|1|Returning item because we had selected a white hoodie and a crew neck was delivered. I have made three orders through NY Lingerie in the past week and a half. Each order has come incorrectly. Twice I have received two Youth XL hoodies instead of Youth L. Bags had an XL sticker placed over L sticker, but clothing tags and fit are XL.
B00HA33NKO|5|They're great!
B008JRTHNC|5|I bought this coat for my dad, and I tried it on when it arrived....so incredibly cozy and nice-looking! I am a bit tempted to order some for my father-in-law and husband, too. I had been shopping around for a wool coat for dad, and I didn't expect to get one this nice for less than $200.<br /><br />I am a bit peeved that this was a \\"lightning deal\\" on amazon when I bought it...for $88, more than the current regular price. I'm staying away from these alleged lightning deals from now on.
B008VPS55S|4|Hi Guys!<br /><br />Do you fight to get out of the bedcovers in the middle of the night?  Do your sheets wrap around you like duct tape?  Well, if so these are for YOU. You will glide out as easily as a skater on ice and, if you need to get back in the bed, you'll slip in without disturbing a soul.  A previous purchaser said they are slippery as a dolphin, and, indeed, that is the case. Testimony indicated they are verrrry LOOONG in the legs, and that is also a fact.  Only a man of, say, 6' 5&#34; or so will not have to get these cuffed.<br /><br />Your ally,<br /><br />A sound-sleeping wife
B0098AAP2G|3|i ordered two pairs of highly reviewed undies on amazon- and this one was just okay.  not exception and definitely not worth $29!  i much prefer the organic bamboo cotton undies i got that are only $11.  for the price i would prefer to have a softer material.  won't be getting these again
B00B17P5HO|5|I love them
B003GD2PFQ|5|My order came in sooner than i expected, and my new socks are getting quite the workout. i use them for my five finger shoes, and i am at the gym two hours a day six days a week, and so far the socks show no wear. I'll definitely be a frequent buyer.
B000B74JKY|2|I don't have this and will not buy it.  How is it possible not to give dimensions and no explanation of your product at all - does it inflate or what!?  Maybe they do not really want you to know what SIZE it is.  amazing....
B000FS7RLM|4|Over the years we've ended up with plain navy or maroon covers on all our family's bank books, making it difficult to find the main checkbook in a hurry.  I bought this smiley cover and the checkbook is now a cinch to locate.  Holds the checks well, feels sturdy.  It did have a strong plastic smell when it first arrived.  I'm very sensitive to smells, so I let it air out in another room for a couple of days before use and now it's fine.
B004TKIY2S|5|love this sleep bra.  I am a 34 DD and it is so soft and comfy at night. It gives just enough support without putting pressure on the \\"gals\\" which can cause plugged ducts. I have washed it about 10 times so far (air drying sometimes) and it has held up well. I may need to buy another as I wear it every night. Favorite!!!
B001DI952C|3|This costume appears to be made out of VERY different fabric than it actually is.  It is so thin it is almost transparent.  On the positive side, it is very comfortable...just will have to find something to wear underneath so I don't scare anyone off for the wrong reason!
B0083G2MSG|2|No where in the description did it say it was a used shirt and that it was missing pearls from the snaps.  Disappointed with product, but it was very easy to return.
B00DGACCJ8|3|Order way larger than you expect but they are sexy
B000HTKO8C|5|Good morning friends my stuff please do not get me what I need never send to the address VLN6875 ADELSO MONTES<br />2250 NW 114TH AVE UNIT 1V<br />MIAMI, FLORIDA 33172-3652<br />United States<br />Phone: 7869724911 is my personal locker or I make a gift card to buy it again and please i need your help thanks greetings from Venezuela that is my size so just do not know where to communicate with you why I write for this via
B00DGW6H1A|2|The color description is not correct. These are a bright apple green rather than olive.
B0007NID0E|3|I think it looks good on my wife, but she feels it does not add enuf uplift to her 38 C's.
B008D3AYF2|5|BON BEBE IS AN EXCELLENT GLOBAL MARK...I RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS VERY GOOD AND IT IS OF EXCELLENT QUALITY FOR CHILDREN.
B007ZN829G|5|Very excellent quality nursing bra.  Just enough coverage to feel comfortable in thinner shirts.  I would buy again and I wish they carried non-nursing bras as well!
B001SN7NSA|4|I really liked this shirt. I wish I would've known it was a 100% cotton cause I would've ordered a slightly bigger size. Otherwise, the shirt is great and looks awesome!
B001ES8XGK|4|Ordered and received on time, perfect condition.  i'm extremely pleased with this petticoat, it only lost a star because it is not lined, and quite scratchy and uncomfortable to the legs.  I imagine I will sew in a smooth slip, so as not to chafe. the volume is quite good, although it only has 2 layers, and one layer is much longer than the other, for shape, I suppose.  the tulle is quite stiff, but not lined with ribbon.  the waist is very comfortable, I am 5'2&#34;, 136 lbs, and generally wear a 6/8.  there is plenty of room in this skirt for another 20 lbs or so, but I am not sure i'd order it if I were a size 2 or even 4, unless you want to adjust the elastic to fit.  very pleased.  will be ordering in other colors.
B008J48ED4|4|retuned and got sm. happy with fit. Im a consistent medium so grab a sm if you are too.
B0093KUWUG|4|Everything was right on. I didn't expect the bust area to be so small. However, it looks really nice on me and I'm pretty sure my spouse will enjoy it.<br />Also, came earlier than expect.
B00T3KJU4U|3|My daughter likes it she was very happy about it, she said that the bottom is a little big but she can wear it anyway and the top you can't wear without a nipple cover so we order one here too for like $2.
B003IXVFLO|5|Whoever invented this item is pure genius! Love this thing!
B004IK8WJY|5|I threw out all of the other underwear that I owned and replaced them with these. The fit is great and the silicone strip really keeps them in place. I have them in every color. Love them!
B00857ZAKU|5|Comfortable all day - no bunching or itching anywhere. An all area great bra!
B004CO12U2|4|Son wears size 4-5 and noticed the shirts could be a little longer. They're perfect for sleep shirts or undershirts but that's about it.
B00A3HG23O|5|My 20 year old son is small in stature and it is impossible to find a pant small enough to fit him in dept. stores.  The 28&#34; waist and 32&#34; length provide a perfect pant for him to wear.  Levi's has always provided those hard to find sizes for my sons.  The color is great and they are made really good.  I will be ordering again!
B00E79XN8Q|4|Pretty little dress.  Not quite as nice looking as the picture.  My four year old loves it.
B00LHQ4GNS|5|Washed well and looked great on my grand-daughter.
B001GG887Y|5|Cool cape, went with the pink rose tiara I got her because she has a sign in her sewing room that says \\"With a tiara and a nice cape, I could rule the world\\".  Well, she rules my world anyway but now, look out, world!
B000GY4L0A|4|My son loved it but I don't think the quality is such that it will withstand hard play.
B00NID3602|5|These jeans fit me great. I love them. I'm small and petite and these jeans fit and feel great.
B00K9OS2LG|5|our baby start teething since he was 2 month old and the drooling was bad - we went through almost 10-15 bibs a day. He is now 7months old with 2 teeth and 2 more on the way and after reading the reviews I bought those bibs a month ago.<br /><br />Compared from my other 40 bibs I have- those are the best. Don't expect to have it all day- especially if your baby drools as much as mine- but now I only need to change 4-5 bibs instead of 10-15 a day.<br /><br />I wish I bought them sooner.
B003AXXUE2|5|I was very pleased with everything regarding this order.  The color and size was exactly what I ordered, also, the sizing was true to size.  I would gladly order from them again.
B00AREOKQE|3|Robert Graham Men's Honeycomb.Too thick, wear it in the summer will be hot.I bought it for my husband,I am from China.
B002ETVLZ8|5|I like the fit I carry a large backpack and ride my bike it fits nicely and not so long you have to worry about it getting trapped in spokes or your gears and it came the day of a heavy rain.
B00OJY9WLQ|2|really thin and made out of rabbit according to the tag
B00CMQ9KQK|4|What can I say? I'm 18 and it caught my eye. Looks really good. Had it for a couple months now, the edges get bruised and it turns really dark brown on the outside. But I still like it, it's practical.
B00F2QRVF4|5|I bought a medium, because usually larges are too bulky around the torso. This medium fits snug around the torso, not a bad fit, just a little tighter than a normal medium tshirt.
B009VIAF1Q|5|I bought it for my husband since his other BB shirt shrunk and was given to me Lol!<br />My husband loves the cartoon design and he gets so many compliments all the time which is cool and makes me proud!
B002LLMS88|5|love the cut of this.
B00QEDVMWM|5|Fit and feel were great.  Was happy to give as a gift to someone.
B00WG3VHBA|4|Fits well but I found it a little tight at the bottom (had to fold them up some to be more comfortable).  But overall good product.
B00O61DPCY|5|Just what I have been looking for. A little more cover than a regular bathing suit so I feel comfortable walking to the pool but still works for swimming. The inner panty fits perfectly with no binding and I love the draw string that keeps a great fit as I have been losing weight. Dries quickly too
B00G5084SO|5|These are so comfortable I may have to order some more.
B00BSKPC5O|4|The shirt was a bit too short and wide for a 2T. My daughter is 34in/26lbs. I'm scared that once I wash it, it will def not for. Per the reviews I saw a lot of &#34;fitted as expected&#34;, but I have to disagree. It had a great color and the print was clean, crisp and centered.
B003IBI0PK|4|the head piece was a little large for my baby.  The quality seemed good overall.
B00DDNPOBQ|5|Very comfortable socks.
B007OAMLZG|4|I bought two of these bow ties for my nephews who were ring bearers in my wedding. They looked adorable and I liked how they were adjustable so that they could wear it over the next few years
B00PXDZ0T0|4|I wish it were thicker, its thin like leggings but not super thin and the size runs a bit smaller so go up a size. I managed since they're stretchy. And the word is great for its size
B002RVGQ8U|4|overall, a good bra. The shape of the cup isn't perfect for me, per say. I have the right size, other bras I have from Freya all fit perfectly. There's just something about the way the cups are shaped for a 38 FF that is just the tiniest bit big. Nothing worth sending it back over, the bra is very comfortable and wears well. I can wear it to work without a single problem, it stays put and so do I. The shaping of the cups is just not my favorite for my particular contour, and it certainly doesn't make me look as well supported and perky as the product image. And as for a 'plunge' bra, I have other bras that do a better job not showing under my low cut tops, so I consider this to be more like a t-shirt bra. It is a good, long lasting, well made bra though and I'm glad I have it.
B00CXAKOGK|5|My daughter loves it. Fits good.
B005EFOXNG|4|Great, lightweight. Cool.  I like the above-the-knee length.  Perfect to relax in at home after work. Double layer allows wearing without underwear.  Wish they had a pocket.  The only problem is that the &#34;champion&#34; tag in the center back of the waistband is somewhat scratchy against your skin.  Solution is to take a stitch-pick and remove it.  Otherwise I would give 5 stars.
B009VZVC8Y|4|Nice design. Fit a bit snug but comfortable.
B004IZOZBI|5|Beautiful dress with vibrant colors. I'm 5'2&#34;and weigh 180lbs. It fits as expected.
B0011G0NAO|4|A little snug but my husband wears them anyway... He was wanting some overalls so I bought these and they seem to be sturdy enough for him.., they stretch enough for him ...
B001CZI0T0|4|I just recieved this wallet today. Its pretty beast. I tried fitting 5 cards into it and it was hard flicking the cards up. The money clip is stable. I must say it is easy to scratch it. What I really like about this wallet is its light weightness. I cant feel anything in my back pocket ! To sum it up, good for money users and few card carriers.
B00FGETXI0|5|My stepdaughter loves it!!  Good and warm and she loves cows!
B000MX0F4G|1|What the difference can be in fit between back closure and this front closure, I can't imagine.  Unless you know in advance that this will fit, I would suggest trying it on in a store first.
B00AM35QKE|5|Great value! Love them! Cannot beat the price!!! Very happy with the purchase!!! These can be used for so many things!
B00JFS2NQM|5|Loved my jeans.
B008RN2M26|3|I love the length and color but the tag is really itchy and can't remove it without putting holes in the shirt
B0099U0LN8|5|The hat came in 5 days and free of defects. Fits perfect and looks great! As long as you order the correct size for your head... It will fit as it should!
B00F4O2H58|5|This robe is comfortable and warm and wonderfully soft, has a belt I don't have to mess with and can't lose. You can almost wear it like loungewear it's so comfortable and not bulky. I love it. The price was great and the quality is high. Fabulous.
B00S12UUHW|5|This is a beautiful bra on!! Fit perfectly!
B005WX24WW|1|Extremely uncomfortable and very very difficult to get on. I wear a size 2-4 so I ordered a medium, it was cutting off my circulation and bruising after 2hours.
B004MN03DK|5|is the second time buying from Bitty Bows Boutique and I'm very pleased with the look and quality, though prices are high and I'm thinking twice whether to buy or not a product because of price
B00FHK79D4|5|I love these blouses .I can buy it again if it comes on different color. Fabric nice and soft.
B00U4IOQQW|1|What the heck the most worst thing I ever spent my $ on way to small like for a child and the material is sooo cheap and thin and some defects!!!!!!!
B001NSCHL8|3|The pants fit funny and have a funny shine to them that I did not expect from the picture. Would not have bought them if I had seen them in the store
B00C9TXY7Q|5|Loved loved loved this item! It's fit as expected. It was a bit cheeky but nothing a pair of sticking couldn't conceal.
B00NBT2Y74|3|Cheap fabric very thin.  I expected better but still cute.
B004BIYFKI|1|The bra has very poor support and is poorly described with no number [#4696].  Playtex needs to fix the way this bra is made and the seller needs to quit ignoring orders.
B005WR587G|4|I read the reviews and most of them said that the Item was 2 (two) sizes smaller than advertised and I ordered XL for my Med size wife and it was still a little small.<br />The item is well made and looks great but the seller needs to note in the ad that it is not sized properly.
B003OQTQ1Q|5|Received as birthday gift to replace old wallet. I agree with a previous reviewer that the leather band with the brand on it is unnecessary however, it doesn't really add any noticeable bulk to the wallet. If that was left off this would be what I consider the perfect wallet. It is a good size and fits in pocket comfortably, even when loaded with cards. The leather and stitching seem to be good quality and should last a long time. Overall, I highly recommend this wallet.
B019438FEG|5|I have this Columbia in 5 colors and wear them all the time
B005P68KDI|4|I like these headbands but I feel the band part is a bit too broad. They take up too much of my baby's head and end up looking a bit much. I do like that the bows are interchangeable and can be take off. I usually just use the bows as clips and they look adorable.
B007NG6OV8|1|First day I wore it. The leather strap broke. Super cute. But wasted my money 😕
B000MXLZ2W|5|Super comfy. Moves with you, doesn't wrinkle, wicks away any sweat... I use these for work and they are awesome. But at will!
B007S7NL9U|4|Was a little disappointed in the &#34;color&#34;. I thought it would be truer white. It looks like the white was just spray painted on. Guess it will work for my needs.
B00AKSBSQW|3|These shorts were a good fit and a good value. However the two pairs I bought both began to rip within a a few weeks of light use. One pair tore around the waistband and the other has two holes in the back thigh area for no reason. For the price, I would ask for a bit more durability. Replacing them every few months essentially negates the money you save over a name brand. If these lasted longer than they did they would be great but instead I am now in the market for a higher quality compression short.
B00KQGJMFW|2|This bag is cute but the quality is not so hot.  I had to return because the strap thread starting unraveling.  Now the hanger hook stitching is coming apart.
B00TJTN9H4|4|too small but looks very nice
B004WN9IVI|3|I love cowl neck shirts, and I've owned several over the years from three dots. I haven't purchased a new one in a while, but I needed a new white cowl neck, and this seem to fit the bill. The fabric is nice, though maybe a bit thin. I love the cowl neck and the length of the sleeves. My main complaint, and the reason for the three star review, is that the shirt is too short. It's not exactly a crop top, but it's much shorter than all the other shirts I've purchased recently, and it just doesn't fall the way I would like it too.
B007L5QUWY|4|This is a nice pair of underwear and totally worth the money. My only complaint about them is the one size fits all being the only option. They are really comfortable, don't get me wrong, but they are tight enough on my hips that my love handles show. This isn't a problem while wearing pants though. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase and it was the quickest shipping I've ever experienced ordering something online.
B00KXR23PA|5|Everyone complained about it being cheap and thin but it's was perfect to me . It fit great . Nice elastic material. I love it I can't wait to wear it 😬
B00GCSBBVG|5|Shirt fits great, true to juniors sizes. I am usually a small but ordered a medium so it would be more roomy.  Looks exactly like the picture
B00E68Z8IG|5|I was extremely nervous to buy maternity scrubs (or any scrubs!) from the internet, but was having no luck finding a selection in stores.  However, these fit wonderfully!  I am 25 weeks pregnant with my 3rd with a big ole belly. I'm 5'5 and currently weigh about 180lb, and I got a medium.  I am not sure what my regular scrub size is because each brand is so different.  The mediums hug my hips, knees, and butt just enough to keep my shape but not enough that they are tight at ALL.  I hate that almost all maternity pants are flare leg.  Who wants a giant flare leg whipping around their ankles when they are already bigger than normal!?  These are a little more than a bootcut opening.<br /><br />I am ordering a second pair now because I just can't resist.  Pulling up that so-soft belly band around my big belly was so comfy, it makes my 12 hour shifts bearable!
B003ILF9D6|5|I love that these are highwaisted, because sometimes this material tends to slide down. They stay up all day which is a plus for leggings. They have the perfect amount of luster so you can wear them during the day or out partying at night. I would deff recommend these to curvy girls because they are very stretchy. With that being said... it is okay to size down. I am 5'5 with a 28inch waist and 43inch hips and I got a Medium.<br /><br />Over all... I Love themm!
B00B2AQFO2|5|love it. it was everything I expected.
B00KHNV0CW|5|This dress fits perfectly, is super soft, and great colors! I absolutely love it! Do suggest you buy this!
B006PI26FS|4|I love this wallet, and it served a minor purpose for a little while. The plastic accordion design just didn't hold up for me. Once that started splitting I tore it out and used it without the barriers. It has more of a purpose now, than it did before! So, to sum it up, If you're looking for a durable wallet and something thats not going to be holding much, this would be it.
B00CPWBE4C|5|The stays are perfect, inexpensive, durable, and come in a nifty high-quality container to store them. But it gets better. The seller sent a (presumably automated) email to me to confirm I had in fact received my order and giving me a customer service # to contact if I have any issues. That is what I call good service. Highly recommend!
B003UP5732|5|If the man in your life is an urban-conservative dresser, this tie is for him. My husband typically shies away from colors, but this tie was a winner. I got an almost similar tie from Tristan and America in Canada (unfortunately not online)for three times the price. Look and feel-wise, there is no difference! I don't care much for the cuff-links, but hey they are included so I am not going to whine about it :)
B000SAQHMW|5|Great. Exactly what I wanted. They were long and I was going to get them hemmed, but decided to see if they would shrink.<br />I probably lost 2-3 inch in length from washing and drying. I am 6'2 and they now fit perfectly. For tall guys these are perfect.
B00MJDLQXQ|5|The fabric is nice, and the recipient has worn it every day since she received it. There is some pilling, but the seams are solid and the fabric is a nice thickness.
B008QL0EYW|5|Great pants.  They're all I'll wear at work.  Wal-Mart never seems to have my size in a color that I want.  To heck with them.<br />I saved money just by not going into their store and buying other crap that I didn't need .
B00A77VGPY|5|I love these socks. Thorlo is the best.  Well worth the extra.
B0078Y03UI|5|I seriously love this brand!  The quality, the fit, the fun textiles, plus Amazon's discount prices make the clothes easy and affordable to wear.  For my body type, the brand runs true to size, and this top is no exception.  The print is stylish and reminiscent of the ikat popular this season, while the cut of the arms and neckline is very flattering and feminine.  I almost missed out on this top in my size, and I'm so glad I ordered when I did.  You won't regret your purchase.
B00CXADIV8|5|Great Belt
B00E4UEQIY|5|This jacket is made of heavy soft cotton. The styling is wonderful with the mix of colors and the beautiful buttons. It is fitted and will look good with pants or skirts. Love the look!
B004ARZKJA|5|Good sturdy, white handkerchiefs.  Just what my husband needed.
B00AE275T8|1|DO NOT BUY ANY ITEMS FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!  If I could give it zero stars, I would!  This is a very cheap, small fitting sweater that was sent damaged and defective.  There were three large holes and black oil on it.  I contacted the seller and sent pictures.  He said he was a small business owner from China and wanted to &#34;offer&#34; me $3 as a refund.  After I said it wasn't acceptable, he said that Amazon policy stated that he didn't have to give me a full refund (even though the item was damaged) unless I returned the item at my expense.  Sending it to China would have cost more than the sweater!  So at the end of the day, I paid money for a cheap damaged item that I have to throw away.  Please don't be fooled by this bad seller!
B00I7ZTIXK|3|They are nice and comfortable jeans. A little large around the waist.
B006O83LGM|5|i bought a couple of carhartt t-shirts here on smazon and (although a bit pricey) was impressed with the quality. While i usually prefer baseball caps, my son's visor sent me looking for one. even though made in china, carhartt must have some pretty rigid standards, because the visor is well-made, fits well, and the built-in sweat band works like a champ.<br /><br />thirteen bucks didn't seem too bad and when i saw visors at the local ball park priced at twenty bucks, i think this one is priced right.
B00HZJWCYG|5|I was especially happy with my purchase when I saw the Same item in store for more than I paid.
B00KZMDB7W|5|The jacket is really light. I like it.
B00FHNJHZE|1|It was horrible. Nothing fit. The sizes were off by a long shot. No thanks to this web site.
B001GFJRT8|5|Love this scarf<br />and when a friend saw it<br />she wanted it for her and twin sister<br />so I ordered 2 more..
B00IDT8K8Y|4|Very well made and fits to a T!
B00ES0TKJU|4|My great grandson loves them they wash up very well
B00GSM2ECQ|3|Runs big- order a smaller size Material has decent quality, but support is not strong To me, not worth the price   I tried another one and the front closures are not working properly. Try another product.
B00T839E1Q|5|It was a lil big but that's on my end but still fit on the last buttons and still made my mid section sweat so :-) and I ordered again but smaller and that one was the size for me!!
B004ROTCQI|5|My husband loves this hat!  He looks like Rocky the Squirrel on steriods but it is exactly what he wanted.
B005ASIPM2|5|good!
B00IJOBIZ0|1|I keep ordering this product for my son's birthday. I get encouraging emails that they are preparing my order, but, alas, nothing shows up, and finally after the last delivery date passes I get an email that says:<br />&#34;The image slipped through the cracks and was not actually okay for us to sell because it did not pass our content usage policy. We happened to catch this one after it was listed on Amazon and wish we had caught it before. We are terribly sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you again for working with us and I am sorry that we were not able to complete your order.&#34;<br />Why, then, is this shirt still up for sale? I have re-ordered the shirt, but it is still not delivered. It looks great, and I wish I had the actual product to review! This is a frustrating experience. Save yourselves: Do not buy.
B00LU0SGVY|3|Cute dress but the fabric underneath the arm holes billows out in a strange way.  It's cut pretty well everywhere else, but then it flares way out just there.  For this price, I will keep the dress, but plan on trying to either stitch it to take it in or to always have a top to cover up--- which was what I was trying to avoid.
B0009OIJIM|5|these little leather key keepers are a MUST for scottie parents.  buy 2 -- they're small
B010N3WWFY|1|Did not like this top. Does not look like the picture.
B0050INND8|1|These were supposed to be medium 8-12 size socks. Well, after a washing they shrunk to little girl's socks, as in 6-years-old! I threw them away. Since Amazon has treated me fair in the past, I decided not to bother with a return.
B00C2LCE2C|4|The petite length is almost perfect for me, little ling but I'm 5'1. I would agree with past reviews that the glare in the leg is a little to much otherwise these scrubs should get me through the 3rd trimester perfectly!
B001N4NYSM|5|Really a nice cap seems well made.
B000UJDM3I|4|I bought this shirt for my boyfriend who is extremely hard buy clothes for due to his size he loves these shirts and they fit him very well. Only thing I wished is more color options in 4 XLT size shirts... basically more varieties would be nice
B00IRL5FYU|5|Kappa makes great athletic clothes and this is such a bargain.  The only caveat is that they run small, so buy the larger size if you are hesitant.<br /><br />I would buy Kappa clothes anytime I see a great price like this.
B00D470O70|5|cute!
B00U5K569U|4|I  like the dress not my favorite but it looked ok. I did get compliments on the dress from my friends. I wore it to a luncheon with necklace and other jewelry and my friends said beautiful  dress has nice soft colors and I agree the colors in the dress are nice.
B0052EULZ8|5|This skirt is fabulous---it looks horrible on the web but trust me it is beautiful.  It has soft colors of pink/salmon with the browns which is great for summer or fall.  I have received many compliments wearing this skirt.  Get it--it's a great deal.  Also very slimming.
B008VIMSQ2|3|These are VERY soft, and comfortable to dance and move around in.  With that being said, they snag so easily and are pretty sheer.  I had higher hopes for these, especially for the high price.
B00GYW5MJ2|3|Sizes are small
B00AMPZP8U|4|Not as opaque as they look in the picture, but I wanted something lightweight so that's okay with me. Worn them a few times for roller derby (rough wear) and so far there are only a few snags.
B0009YI3DS|4|If you love t-shirts and knit tops but hate the \\"nipple\\" view factor, these products will allow you to ascertain the best \\"smoothing\\" factor for you. <br />One of the products in this assortment I found to be correct for me. Another one works well, another of the included products I would never buy again. <br />This mixed package is priced so you can afford to experiment and make the comparisons for yourself. <br />Don't know where to begin? this package is highly recommended for the new consumer of this type of product.
B0015PKB08|5|Finally, socks that are long enough after washing to not crowd the toes on my size 10 feet!  And comfortable too!  Only time will tell how they hold up to washing, but I am a happy girl right now.
B008AJMHEU|5|I bought these for my husbands birthday.  He loved them and he said they were comfortable too!  Our friends get a kick out of them as he is 54 years young!!!
B0040Y5LD8|5|I was a hit at the 60's & 70's Party this past weekend.  Everyone was dressed retro and I received dozens of compliments and was pressed to take pictures every five minutes.
B0058J1TEY|5|BOUGHT IT FOR MY SISTER WHO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO SMALL. GOT IT IN A 16-18 PLUS SIZE AND SHE LOOKED REALLY  GREAT AND CURVES IN THE RIGHT PLACES.
B0096A1OG4|4|Actually bought this as part of a Halloween outfit, I've washed it and worn it several times and none of the shiny silver parts have cracked or started peeling. Also FYI it doesn't show it in the pictures but this shirt is SHINY. The white parts are mirrored silver.<br /><br />Turns out it's much better quality than I thought.
B00IX7VWG8|5|Good size for work. i use it as Japanese construction guys use them for headbands etc.
B00EYKPARA|5|Hat is Adorable, Great Quality!
B0031U0PR4|5|Bought this as a gift for my dad and he loved it. Nice quality.
B000PYK7C2|1|LOOKS VERY CHEAP IN REAL
B00FN83Z10|4|nice, simple sheer blouse. just as advertised- fit nicely, could be a little longer in the back but it's good.
B00HZGFF70|3|Size was small and the zipper is from the wrong size, makes me think this is a women's jacket.
B00NPK6CLI|1|Stupid product and it came partial.  No free gift came with the order and worst customer service. Don't buy it
B00GXN2L1Y|4|I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it, the color and the printing are true to the picture but the size runs a bit small overall. Any fan would like it and it is definitely a statement t-shirt.
B00CW898KQ|4|I loved the dark brown color and the fact that it's a shorter sweater. The fabric is fine. I heeded the advice to go up a size, but found I really didn't need to.
B003XVF4JU|5|This costume is awesome, I've worn it twice for Halloween and once on a normal day. If they recognize the character they love the costume
B00LVUTF4U|3|Good quality. I thought that it was just a little too full to go with the Maggie Tang 3/4 Sleeve 1950s Vintage Rockabilly Dress. With another dress it might be perfect.
B00NIN2IQK|5|This sweater is awesome! It was shipped relatively quickly as well. Very happy with this purchase!
B004PBDNPY|5|excelente
B007C4GHS6|4|These are soft and thick socks, and if you're trying to keep your little ones feet warm, these will do the trick.  The elasticity in them is really good too which means your baby will have a hard time making them slip off. They are a bit short, I wish they were longer, but otherwise they are great.
B00JT3702A|5|This is a very unusual and pretty cap. It is well made.
B00IAROHS6|5|Friends love it .Expect more orders.
B005JIPBI4|5|Jacket fit perfect! As for comfort.....the first time he wore it was Thanksgiving weekend in Ohio with a below 18 degree wind chill factor and he stay warm during the entire X-mas parade. Too say the least his wife froze to death. I will be finding me one as warm as this one. He likes pockets and the lightweight but warmth it provides in the cold. This winter jacket was what he was looking for.
B007SZL8MO|4|I really love the bows and think this product is reasonably priced. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because a few of the bows had ink marks on it so my daughter wont be able to wear them. Other than that it came with a nice assortment and the shipping was fast.
B000UZBSVA|5|Giving 5 stars as this wallet was wonderfully priced for genuine eelskin.  It has more than met my expectations as far as enough room for credit cards, a few different compartments and I really like the outer zipper for loose change.  The size is perfect if you usually carry a large handbag.  If you carry a small handbag, look at the wallet measurements to ensure it will fit in a small handbag.  The leather/skin is soft and have had no problems with the closure or anything else.  Am very pleased and have seen the identical wallet priced much higher elsewhere.  I purchased the tan color and it is exactly as pictured.  Just wish there were more vibrant colors other than the standard brown, black or tan.  Great price, lovely wallet and hope it lasts a long time.
B00KZMD7O4|5|Awesome jacket. Looks and feels great. Just a bit large.
B008CM6IOU|5|I love this little outfit!  The sizing is just right.  Everything shipped in one bundle making it easier to wrap as a gift.  It also arrived on time.  Product was definitely as advertised.  I'm very pleased with my purchase!
B00HRJQJTS|5|great Tshirt
B00QL7SR0G|1|Poor quality shirts, expect them to be oversized and cheaply made.  The collar stays went out of place after one wash.
B003F1LOHY|4|I own quite a few styles of Kangol's and wish there were more reviews on them on Amazon. It's tough to know how a Kangol is going to to fit ahead of time since you usually can't go to the mall and try them on, especially the more obscure ones like this one. I own the Organic Canvas Cap in charcoal grey, size Large. I'm normally a 7 3/8 in New Era 5950 baseball caps if that helps.    To compare this Organic Canvas Cap the Classic 504 Ventair, which is probably Kangol's most popular, this Canvas Cap fits much tighter and snugger. It fits tighter in the head-area, giving it a more form-fitted look. The brim is pretty short, not really useful for keeping sun out.    The hat is made of \\"organic canvas\\", which turns out is just 97% normal cotton + 3% organic cotton. I can't feel the \\"organic\\" in it. Seriously though, the \\"organic\\" had led me to believe that this hat might be a softer, more comfortable fabric. Instead, it's pretty stiff and thick, like normal canvas. It's not very flexible at all. Compared to the Canvas Galaxy though, it's a little looser.    There is the classic Kangol kangaroo logo on the back, which is really a must since you're paying a premium for the logo/ brand name. I am pretty sure you could find a very comparable (possibly more comfortable) hat for half the price.    I will say that this hat fits a little stiff. The Classic 504 Ventair's - and a lot of other styles - have a stretchy head-band. This Organic Canvas Cap does not. The fit does not really give/ expand at all in the headband area because of that. So you absolutely need to know your size ahead of time. If you get the wrong sizing or a tight fit, this hat would be quite uncomfortable. Mine fit ok initially; I've been trying to stretch it out a little bit at a time to give it not such a tight-fit. That said, there's not much room for error with the sizing on this one.    If you look at the picture(s) provided on the site, you can see there is quite a bit of headroom in the back/rear/upperpart of the hat. It just feels a little bit off to me because of that. I feel like I'm pulling the hat forward a lot because of it.    All that said, I think the Organic Canvas Cap is a very sleek, good-looking cap. It looks very retro, old-school, vintage, hipster cool. It's the classic newsboy/ driver's cap. To me, it's a timeless classic. It's just a little bit too expensive at $40 for the price. However, I do find myself wearing this hat a lot, so I guess I'm getting my money's worth out of it.
B000TA397M|5|thick, warm, soft and fits well, fit all of the requirements. the recipient was happy & item is holding up great.
B00DR1EZ64|4|Pluses: The convenience of having a belt buckle that can be slid on and off easily. No more hassle with being in between the traditional belt holes. As people have said great when you are losing wt, etc. The belt buckle is good quality and great looking with dress pants.<br />Minuses: Not many - just that the leather is nothing great to write home about. The lining on the inside - doesn't feel smooth and sometimes feels rough on certain pants and you feel a friction sliding the belt in and out.<br />Other: I am a size 36 waist and realised that 38 on the belt still made it feel long as there are no extra loops to keep the belt end close to waist. But easy to adjust as you just cut it to the correct length based on the marking on the belt.<br />Overall: More than Decent belt buckle and convenience, justify the money you pay for this. The leather could have been better.
B00CZDRUQC|5|This is likely one of the final new pieces of Marc Ecko Cut & Sew I'll get to order, as I was told the line was sold and likely will not be started up again.  Items are no longer offered via the Ecko Unlimited site and they already closed the Cut & Sew outlet in Vegas.  I've loved this line from Marc Ecko since it started - it's a grown ups urban line.  The fit is standard, not baggy and loose.  No pants hanging well below the waist line, no big, long t-shirt billowing in the wind.  All very edgy, trendy and current.  I haven't found another clothing line that does it this well consistently.
B005HWAUGK|4|Great
B00EEGLNM0|5|This bandeau top fits perfectly!  As a 32B I find it hard to find bandeau tops that fit perfectly, because usually they are too large, but a small in this one is amazing.  Plus, the ruching makes it more unique and pretty.  Overall, I loved it so much I also ordered it in red!
B00D2GRS04|5|Let's just say....I am ordering a lot more of the blouses!!
B00CKGB91G|3|According to the other reviews and what people said with sizing, I order a small, assuming the spandex would stretch enough to fit but still hold itself up.  The small fits my hips and thighs just fine, but it's way too short for a maxi.  I'm 135 lbs. and 5'9&#34;, this small barely reaches my upper ankles.
B00PADBIMG|5|I love everything about this dress.... My baby girl will be beautiful for my WEDDING DAY...
B00D6OY4YK|4|Screen printing was well done & the shirt is great
B00H2SLT1W|5|Like a glove, amazing fit not too small or big just right
B00DRH6GAG|5|Perfect Gift! She loved it! :)
B0001YSBFG|5|Awesome quality. I will buy more of these soon. So soft and comfortable. Washes without shrinking. Go Chicago Bears!  Win!
B001KFWKVG|3|My large shrank to a medium<br /><br />I usually order Medium-Tall from on-line retailers for pocket tee's at more than twice the price.  So I was excited to try this out and save some bucks.<br /><br />I read another review saying the item shrank (thank you reviewer!) and so ordered a large.  Sure enough it shrank down to a tight fit.<br /><br />Material is heavy and looks like it will wear well.  Shoulder seams are &#34;single-needle&#34; so probably will break apart early...we will see.<br /><br />One odd thing -- the material in both of my shirts feels just a bit scratchy/rough.  I washed mine in a bunch of fabric softener and used softener cloths in the dryer...no change.  It is for this reason I bumped it down a star from 4 to 3.
B00NERW1XU|5|Loved it
B00K5LIUDS|4|Good but not great. No liner in the shorts. Good fine. Not worth more than the 3.99 I paid.
B003E6XO82|4|This is a really good bra. It lives up to the product description. If I could change one thing, it would be the number of rows of hooks. It fit exact, and I like to have about 4-5 rows to choose from if I happen to loose/gain weight.
B00C18MB6U|4|Great fabric used. Sturdy zipper, measurements and fit line up perfectly. Very classy and sexy women's look. Will order from this seller again!
B00AKFPOZQ|5|My girlfriend went crazy over for it and it was a cool gift for Valentine's day,I recommend this for boyfriends who have a anime lover girlfriend.
B00MY67JPC|3|It doesn't look like what it does on the picture posted here, the words take up the whole shirt. I am not displeased with what I got but you should try to be more accurate with what the product will look like.
B002BWP186|3|I like this billfold but just like. It is not that small and suit for me take some cash and 2 or more cards.
B00B6UG28C|5|My son thinks it is super-stylish and wanted to wear it all day after he tried it on.
B00DSJT9IE|3|not very flattering
B00971OYZK|3|The shirts fit my son perfectly but I hate the clip on tie thats worthless due to the length, I thought the bigger in size the longer the tie. Why buy a shirt that has the extras and you cant utilize it. I hope they take this comment into consideration because the tie was one of the reasons i bought the choice of color shirts and I purchased 3. I feel cheated!
B008NNU9YS|3|Top was snug and pants were unwearable due to being too small. I liked the color and style, it was just too small
B009MJ6PEA|5|Great shirt - holding up well. nice quality and great colors
