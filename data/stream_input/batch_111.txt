B007HS14AS|3|It seemed to quiet down my generator somewhat.  Would have liked it to quiet it down a bit more.
B00GIA297I|1|Do not buy this product if you own a 2013 Ford F1 50 pickup. The beauty rings do not fit properly on the truck. They bottom out before they can sit flush against the outside lip of the wheel/rim. They stick out about one fourth of an inch. They also make clicking noises as the vehicle moves down the road. I removed them from my truck, and now I am stuck with scratched paint on all four wheels.
B002935IV2|5|Kept the Top Carrier in the same place.
B003JH68SY|4|Bought these for our 2015 GMC Canyon.  They fit without cutting or trimming. We have a white truck so the beige color matches the seats. Looks great.
B00M2AVA9G|5|Have ordered these magnets five different times for our Toyota dealership. Work great, always on time.
B002R0OMNW|5|Worked perfectly.
B003T77VT4|1|Unfortunately I purchased this with the Amazon guidance that it would fit my Honda CRV roof racks. It does not because it extends so far back that I cannot open my rear 5th door.
B00317DY02|5|Just as I expected  :)
B00JBI9M06|5|Thank you so much! I needed some working headlights. These lights make my 2009 Cobalt look great.
B000F6DNMQ|3|glue didn't stick it very well despite following all the instructions
B00NEL6HT0|5|Purchased Product on January 3, 2015. I installed it in my 2008 Yaris myself, without issue. It was a simple install and can be done in 5-10 minutes. It does the job well and I have not had any issues. I have had it over 6 month and it work flawlessly. For most people 6 months is not a long term review but I have diven the car 25k. I spend a lot of time in my car and have noticed it keeps the dust down. I also installed a Blower Motor Assembly at the same time.
B009GILWJA|5|Ez to install- looks great
B00HEDJ7OG|5|Way less than OEM and keeps my transmission nice and cool.
B00TPVD1WY|1|Incredibly overpriced for 2 pieces of metal that should have been on the car when I bought it.
B00RUDYT20|5|Excellent...
B000CO7N5Y|5|Great product, but those stiff wires that hold in in place are finger killers. I'll bet they make a tool for that.
B00GSAUHB8|5|works great in my 2015 PRIUS and definitely keeps my car cool. An awesome sticky pad came with the sun shade that I put in my car and have my phone stick to it. thanks!
B000HBNVNA|5|Great
B00PV6TYX2|5|Excelent
B00A66GYDA|5|Can't beat the price on this,easy to use, and comes with booklet listing all the possible codes you may have. Good buy.
B000FW2MWW|5|It was just what I needed to use the battery tender.
B0001MQ7EK|4|This is a great size and works well.  This is the second one that I have purchased.
B0076AU0YS|5|Used to replace 2005 Corolla. Will have to see how it stands the weather.
B008Z3TUIW|4|Larger than I thought it would be, but a nice patch with Velcro already stitched on the back.
B000QJJ45M|3|Would have been 5 starts, but one pipe wasn't flared enough...had to rent a tool to complete the install.  PITA.
B005G194BO|1|Not at all what I had thought this would be. From the pictures it looks like plastic and there is not much of a product description. For everyone looking, this is thin fabric, very little to no protection. First rock I took to the chest, was not pleasant at all..If you are looking for a roost guard for maybe riding in sugar sand you'll be ok..but hard clay and rocks didn't feel good.
B00OO2K7CQ|5|Perfect fit. Excellent quality...
B003JH9NG8|5|It was better than I thought it would be. Very thick and I heard that was an expensive brand so the price was amazing. It was also very easy to cut to fit, just used kitchen scissors.
B00C2RDK9C|5|👍🏻
B000C8413M|5|Installation went as expected. The part was a perfect oem replacement. All connectors were exact fits, and wiring was perfect lenghts.
B005GLQCKA|3|A quality product... But doesn't have the leverage of a good G clamp if the pistons are really stuck in the caliper... I used it on a Toyota Tundra and the device pushed in the Pistons on one side... But wasn't strong enough for the other side.... Better to use a 3 inch G clamp...
B000W0RQ8C|3|does not fit the ram 2500 receiver with the adapter
B000EDSSDO|2|When compared against my mini wood working level I realized it wasn't accurate. No wonder I felt like I was sleeping on a hill.
B0055RD4L0|5|Love the decal
B001R5XSGU|5|Just the job.
B00H6XPZN6|1|These fell off all the time. I eventually got the universal sunshade instead which works way better![[ASIN:B00OUKQGE0 TFY Universal Side Window Sunshade - Fits most Car Models - 2 Piece]]
B00P2B6RWC|1|first and last time buying king hobby first you can't track item b/s just give excuses on product delivery bad bad bad
B0093J6AHQ|4|Great kit , will save time and money fixing  cars/trucks.  The book and DVD are a great help putting the Load Pro to work.
B00EMHTB5W|5|Better than the picture shows
B00C9XCJA0|5|Good
B00QYBJ992|3|Was ok but really really holds the heat in the summer!
B003EL747O|5|Received the product quickly. It was an exact fit and was what I needed.
B00OKQ1P86|4|Not as strong as expected
B00NQ8E90K|5|Used for a &#34;Big 3&#34; upgrade on my 1981 c10 and works perfect ! Great quality product with fast shipping !
B00IC6LE54|1|It held together but only lasts one trip. Spend the money and buy a good one and you get crappy product. Not happy expected more from Reese and got crap.
B008ENE05Q|5|Perfect, see picture.
B007V2D07U|5|At first when I ordered it, I thought it was expensive! BUT now that I have used it for several weeks, it's worth every penny! Major difference in my vehicle now when I get in. Well made and should last a long time!!
B003VBJZP6|2|Need to return this as I got two?????
B000SL4AA2|1|Terrible...I wish I could rate it zero stars, would not power on at all.
B004AQUCK8|5|Perfect fit. Great job
B00MQU82Z2|5|Very easy install, a small hole needs to be made for the cables to pass through the bumper. Around an hour install max. Looks factory when not lit,  but definitely sets the car apart from other focus' on the road.
B005C5CU0G|5|Exactly what I needed for my Waveblaster 11
B0031BUBDG|5|This tensioner is great it made my bike shift so much better
B00SLRCHE6|5|Extremely fast shipping. Had hardware store cut key for $2.50. Key worked in door. After some searching, found website/FTP and was able to find programming directions. After second try key worked! Remote needs to be programmed by locksmith or dealer. Will try locksmith.
B0009YIE1O|5|Used this on the back of the Jeep to mount my spare. We welded 3 bolts on it so the tire would sit on it properly. Its angled out enough and holds a 35x12.50 just right where I can still access the back of the jeep a little. Highly recommend and this will work until I get a new rear bumper with tire holder.
B000ZIZ32W|5|This is 100% metal tool and made removing wiper arms on a 1999 GMC sierra 1500 the easiest job ever.
B008UC6E1E|5|Great, shipped on time, easy installment. Fits perfect.
B0009OR99W|5|Arrived fast and is a quality tool.
B00GYCDZF0|5|Works great, Keeps the CB Mic out of the way but still accessible. Highly recommend. Many people on the trail have commented how they like it.
B000E28EK2|2|THe tube the reciver hooks into is welded in noticably crooked
B00PYFVWAI|5|I love my seat covers they fit my car well. Thanks amazon for all the saving
B00M2USM7Y|5|IT`S WORK GOOD.I WOULD RECOMMENT IT.
B00CQK70VO|5|Love them
B00504MVHQ|3|Poorly packaged.  It arrived with the plastic broken, but super glue-able.  Working well.
B0036BRJ04|5|I used to be a dealer for this, and it's still as good as it was 35 years ago, thank you!!!
B0024E6W02|5|Very Pleased made the task of emptying the tanks much less of a chore.
B0033WDH2K|5|Very easy to install
B000QIJKJI|3|Same as OEM<br />Well, after being on the truck for a year the layers are starting to separate and it looks like small bubbles are forming under the clear exterior.  I'm going to contact the seller to see if there is a remedy.  Will post later.
B004I0XEI8|5|Looks just like the ones Ford put in when the car was new!  And it comes with a light bulb!
B001QVBUYW|5|Best ball joint for the price ....<br />Better than Moog, better than OEM<br />Only thing that is better than these are dynatracs are Carlisles
B00XNNSY7W|5|Great
B00UGDAVKU|5|Amazing battery tender... Actually added more charge to batteries that my other tender said were fully charged.... Easily worth a 150 bucks even though I paid less than 50
B00HQQZ6L4|5|Fit GREAT
B002JFQFNA|1|Very opaque lens I thought they had a plastic cover over the lens.  They did not.  Disappointed.
B000I1KJT8|5|works well
B007XMJJO6|5|Two minute install, love the look.
B00PGH0YC6|4|Mugen oil cap keeps oil in looks good out. matches oem head color.
B0052FROSY|5|better than expected!
B0064IU5FW|3|2011 F150 Ecoboost- The performance mode I could feel the increase in HP and torque. The economy mode for best mileage I did not see an increase in MPG.
B000Z3EIC8|4|Good stuff.
B00S75PH80|2|Yeah, I am fearful this will break when I put it on my C/10.  I thought chrome plastic implied some thick sort of plastic.  This is moe like something you hang on the wall, not above a trailer hitch :/
B001TQMZWU|1|This chair was very fragile and very expensive not worth the money.
B00WYRL1VY|3|The helmet is nice.  The bluetooth lets me hear my music from my iPhone 6+.  I can hear people when they call me fine, but unless I am going 30mph or less, I am told that I sound like a bumbul bee to them, and not understandable at all.
B001FAGJAY|5|Great look! Love it!
B009GO6CYO|1|I received this as a Christmas gift in 2014. I put it on my travel trailer in the spring and tested it and it worked fine at the time. The first time I went to use the trailer that summer the jack didn't work, the battery and inline fuse were good it just wouldn't work.I called Best Choice Products and was told sorry about your luck your out of warranty,they only warranty it for 60 days.
B00K6BGXEU|5|The part worked well as advertised.  Exact fit.  Thanks.
B00853A6FI|1|Not mentioned is that it does not fit the 2007 Silverado 2500HD Classic body style. The add says &#34;2007--2013 Chevrolet Silverado or GMC Sierra Black Bezel and Handle with Codeable Lock Package by GM 22755305&#34; No where does it say not 2007 Classic body style. I broke my black bezel getting it off before taking the new one out of the package. Now I'm stuck needing to purchase a new bezel. Frustrating to say the least.
B00LNDQ930|5|Wow wonderfully bright in my motorhome! twice as bright as the motorhome lights! Gonna order more for kitchen area!
B00902G11Q|5|Works like OEM.  Requires door panel removal FYI.
B000CHU038|3|they weren't the right size
B00U31WDL0|1|It will not hold any size cup even sitting still
B009IFICP8|5|Easy to install and arrived in a timely manner!
B003ZNZ9BE|5|My wife loves the new look, everyone thinks we have a new truck.
B000PMJBRG|5|Perfect replacement on 1998 indmar engine
B00E4HDOI0|4|Works great! Bought this for my boyfriend he works outdoors and underground. He hates being cold. After his first week with it he said it kept him really warm maybe even too warm he started sweating. Good battery life. Can adjust warmth levels. When weather gets cold again will buy second battery to have as back up.
B00LC4NH4Y|5|Found they use these one quite a few cars.
B000IYNVS6|5|The fan works just as it should. I caution against putting any stock into the reviews that say &#34;5-minute install&#34; or something similar. That is simply not true on a 2003 Dodge Dakota. It was more like an hour plus job. Had to remove upper and lower fan shrouds, the upper plastic radiator reservoir/windshield wiper fluid reservoir, and I had to loosen the support brace that bolts at the top of of the upper cross member in front of the radiator and down to the frame of the truck. They decided to put this brace directly in front of the upper left side bolt that holds the electric fan in place.<br /><br />No way anyone is doing all this in 5 minutes on a Dakota. But, after I got it installed I started the truck, turned the AC to Max and bingo, I have an electric cooling fan again. Truck had gotten hot twice before I figured out that the old electric fan wasn't working any longer.
B0049ZLXYY|5|They shipped right away & work great.
B004SSEF56|5|Got this lanyard awhile back...does the job. With every day use the white jeep lettering cracked slightly but is still in tact! Great product & price will order from again!
B007VRF6WM|3|Some of the nuts that are welded to the frame were stripped. Other than that sea to be ok.
B00XZCHCHE|4|Lightweight and cool in the heat.  I think this was a good purchase for my money.  Only thing I wish is that it had the spine armor instead of just padding, but I guess Ill need to buy that.
B000I1IWVA|5|Perfect and chip
B00AKXERZQ|5|these are great.. small profile but hold a standard cup of coffee
B0054R9Y6A|3|I love the helmet for the price but large is too big, medium is too small. It's not really safe that my helmet moves around on my head
B003U53JYG|5|Awesome
B00JA80PEO|4|Works amazingly. Glue is so crappy on all the velcro pieces that it comes off easier than the velcro. Otherwise Id give it 5 stars. cant beat the price
B0051XBNDY|5|makes wiring a back up camera or rear entertainment system a breeze!
B0062A4HE2|4|Looks like carbon fiber, but very very small piece. Make sure it is large enough for your project before ordering
B00IZNZOYQ|5|works perfect
B00FP2UQ6G|5|Looks nice and easy to install. Very well-made product.
B00247DI3I|4|Does as it says, restored my steering wheel leather. Leaves a great look on the seats. Not too shiny like some other. Held up well. Not as long lasting as some dedicated creams I've tried.
B00FVZG7C4|2|This is a wind deflector made of 3/32&#34; plexi plastic, upon install one of the outside mount ears broke off after tightening the mount screws, I was actually putting the tool back in the box when it popped, I don't think I would take it on the interstate for a 300 mile ride because of it's flimsy, thin material, but at lower speeds under 55 mph and little or no gravel I feel it is trust worthy.<br />The package (box) was so messed up that I took video's of it before touching it on the porch...Get what you pay for, would not buy again, would not recommend.
B004ZL9CFO|3|Didn't expand big enough for my cup.
B007GBK10A|5|Excellent. Will buy from again!
B004W6HRGS|5|very good
B00IX5V8KA|5|perfect
B0070DXFYS|3|Fits fine but the vent tube is tiny compared to stock. I drilled mine out and re-threaded for 3/4&#34; FIP
B00JBJ3QAW|1|Head lights suck,don't waste your money I even put silicon all around them before installation, still leaked.
B00G4BXGR8|5|Was easy to install, perfect fit
B0049OOV1W|5|LOVE that I can get OEM exact replacement brand parts, confirmed to fit my vehicle, for almost half the cost of the dealer or local parts store.
B009G5EVVE|5|Genuine Honda Part in Factory box! Just like I wanted. And at the LOWEST price I could find! Cheaper then Honda would sell it for! Very Pleased!
B008HZMP30|5|nice quality good price
B00NTR458Y|5|I found the light really bright, that is, sufficiently bright to warn other drivers in day or night. Actually I hadn't tested it in the dark, but it was bright enough in the day that I'm sure this thing will blast with brightness in the night. The strobe pattern is really the icing on the cake!
B009TEBEGW|2|These will not work with Kurykan 'silver bullets' as a halogen to LED upgrade. I bought a pair knowing I would have to modify the bulb or ballast to scrunch them into the lamp cavity. I was hell bent to get them to work, so I cut a quarter inch off the rear ballast with a Dremel cutting wheel, being careful not to cut into the anode and cathode leads. Then, I sealed the leads with JB Weld epoxy and found that they just fit. I got them hooked up and they worked fine. But, after about 3 weeks, one of the lights quit working. I thought it might be a connection problem until I noticed, in short order, that the other had failed as well. In my opinion, it boils down to the LED's (2 watt) - 6000k themselves. I would venture to say that the cost of each LED ( a total of 6 in a pair) was under a buck. A replacement LED meeting the same specifications cost me $3.95 each. But the replacement LED's aren't what you want to get involved in. I have no clue otherwise how or why they failed, but they failed...... and in a hurry. I tend to trust circuitry, even the LED driver circuit. I will simply say, caveat emptor and good luck.
B007MVI5C0|5|The quality seems good. It went on easy after removing the plug inside the inlet.
B00H8KTBI2|3|When it works, it works well. Sadly, it only works in two of my six cars, and not the one I bought it for. I don’t think the ground contacts are in the best place
B00B19SEVG|1|I have 2015 toyota 4runner limited. Installation takes less then 10 minutes. The material seems a little flimsy. Once installed it looks pretty good. Not good as the sample picture. It bends very easily. It would be nice if it was more solid and tough.<br /><br />I bought this ventvisor so that I can leave the window slightly open when its raining. There is a small gap that allows the rain in when I open the window even the slightest. So the function is total fail. It advertise saying keep the window open when raining. Cannot do that at all. You can also see other review saying the same thing. So if you want to have the leave the window open during rain this one is definitely not the one to get. Total fail at the design.
B00BUS3AKS|5|I absolutely love this!!!  Worth every penny.
B00B2AEG2A|3|For $50 you can have the complete 3 inch lift kit from rough country
B008H2OWQQ|4|Dropped the rating to 4 because it says OEM and OEM is a sealed ujoint. Not that that is bad if you want a greasable one. Did fit right into my 2003 3500 4x4 dodge ram.
B002R38TCE|4|The product shipped quickly and worked well, but I do not know about longevity.
B001AGNHV2|5|What a difference a new exhaust system made on my 2005 Grand Caravan.  I needed a new catalytic converter, and opted to replace the whole system in one move (especially since I am in New England and the components all rot out from the winter salt).<br /><br />I highly recommend having a local shop do the installation, as getting this over the rear axle would've required removing the rear sway bar.  It was short money and I still saved hundreds over having the local muffler shop sell me the parts.
B00T47K604|1|Was told this would fit my 2000 Pontiac Sunfire.  Not so.  The extenders clicked into the clasps on the floor but the snap on the actual belt would not fit into the extenders.  I went to remove them so they could be returned and they would not undo.  I had to get a mechanic to remove them so I could actually wear my seatbelt.
B00027GYOW|4|Used on a 1958 Evinrude. Fits almost like the original except for a slight tilt on the bottom where the spark plug wire inserts whereas the original laid flat. Just makes it a bit more difficult to fit but works just as well.
B005H52P8I|5|Work great. Perfect condition.
B00OU5LOT2|5|I bought this kit for a Mazda 3. I also recently bought a interior kit like this but another brand. However using this kit it is way better installation wise and wire wise I used the Led glow kit before. Installed it in a eg hatch for some reason the kit led glow brand was permanently wired to the control box I had to maneuver the wires/stupid big led through the carpet etc. through the caret also the kit lights where very bulky and the wires where not long enough. Barely made it where I wanted to mount but I made it work.<br /><br />This opt7 kit though is very good easier to install and a lot of zipties more than I actually needed. The wires where detachable with connectors easier to route and hide wires maneuver things. Connectors to the control box. Optional cig lighter power easier to plug and play. But I wanted cleaner install. I like this kit also it gives 3 different fuse box taps the other kit I had to separately order because it gave only one style fuse tap. This kit is way better also it includes the LED kit very flexible led strips with double back tape. Screws and mounting hardware. The best part of is very easy to control it comes with two wireless control. The settings are also awesome it has multifunctional settings. Changeable led light settings. Now every time I drive the car I don't get that bored and feel lightened up lol. I highly recommend this kit is very good awesome.
B001AMHPNM|5|As others have said - just add a piece of PCV pipe with a small hole drilled to keep it attached to the end for a handle and you've got a cheap and easy (took about 2 minutes) handle for it.  If you plug the end it will also float nicely.
B0031XI4RO|5|It did exactly what it was suppose to do. The refrigerator is working perfectly.
B001J5UU9Q|3|A little disappointed in the product.  The workmanship wasn't great.  The instructions could have been a little more clear.  Had to remove burs and polish pieces to get them to fit together.  But after it is done it sounds great.  Maybe it was made on a Friday. :)
B00H6XPZN6|4|Performs as expected. I've been using the shades for 2 months. Still like new. I had no problems with the suction cups. Once they are mounted, they stay in place. Would definitely recommend!
B001AWDX92|4|I can tell you how the battery is in the short term.  Same size as the  GSYUASA that came with my bike.  GSYUASA and YUASA are sister companies (according to customer service at the Pennsylvania YUASA plant).  The only issue that I had with the listing is that when it describes the measurements it is the measurements of the box in which the battery and the acid pack comes, not the battery itself.  I had to go to the YUASA website to get the actual dimensions of the battery.  It was super easy to add the acid, charge and seal up the battery (it is shipped dry, but comes with the acid).  Short term it is working great, we shall see if it lasts as long as my OEM battery.
B00FUNPBA6|5|oh come on!!! How could anyone hate this Sticker?? its funny, a conversation piece, high quality, what else could a 50 year old single redneck want?<br />this has to be a top 5 bumper sticker of all time; besides of course the Donald Trump stickers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Sexy<br />Eye catching<br />funny<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not even one
B003UYYGTO|5|Easy install. Will update as goes.
B0007ZDRUI|3|Haven't had a positive test on it yet but I'm sure it'll work. The instructions are written incorrectly as it describes using either a red or silver fitting connecting the hose to the tool but there is no red fitting. The one with 2 small holes in the side was apparently meant to be red as that's the correct one to use with engine vacuum and the other without the side holes is for a hand pump. When I used the appropriate engine vacuum fitting, it wouldn't pull air through it at all. I tried taping off one of the 2 holes as someone from lisle suggested but it still wasn't enough so I went with the hand pump fitting and it works but not well as it pulls air through so fast that it just looks like suds. I'll probably modify the engine vacuum fitting to make the holes a little smaller to try and make it work like I'd expect.<br /><br />All in all it'll probably get the job done but if you plan on running into blown head gaskets often enough, I'd go for the more expensive one that has a bulb built into it
B0002BC06E|5|The best electrical troubleshooting tool for electrical in a vehicle. It's better than a meter in a lot of troubleshooting, particularly for lighting.
B00CRT8H0W|4|These goggles get four stars for quality, looks and fit. They fit my very small woman head (most woman hats are too large for me), but my cheek bones are too high and they get smooshed under it and it looks funny. So I'm returning them, but I still think they are worth buying if you don't have high cheek bones.
B000C59M8Y|5|These were shocks are amazing!!! The shocks are quite an upgrade from the OEM parts on the truck.
B00MIYO1QU|5|If you have wrangler 10A bumper this is what you want to mount your winch I don't know why they put so many screws and washer inside the kit but don't worry about them there are for main screws that you use they are easy to spot once you put bracket in place whole job took me 40 min with power tools 2 hours if you use non power tools overall great purchase you can't go wrong. Don't try and assemble with bumper on your have to take it off not all the way but enough to bracket into place loosen all 8 screws to the tip of the bolt.
B000CQ6J66|5|Went in easy.  It came with 1ga wire rather than 2ga in description, I found that by Googling part number. Bonus!
B00CKKFFVM|3|Cheap but at the price expected. Really lacking on so called owners manual, install instructions are very vague. No instructions cover the yellow wire?? All in all very disappointed with instructions and no hook up material to fasten the strips to the body.
B002M3KSK0|5|Roof rack worked perfectly for my Cadillac SRX. Installed very easy and had no issue's with the gear on my roof. I would recommend this product.
B00LU4L7V6|5|Completely satisfied.
B000E4GDH6|4|The plastic piece attached to the spring came off and could not be secured.  I was able to make it work in the car, but am surprised this important little piece was broken
B001AY2WLU|4|very nice, but I will give it 4* because it's Heavy and can't  carry it with your key's daily.
B007RNW3FS|3|As reported by others, the bolt that screws into the back of the skull is a little small and makes for a semi-loose connection. To tighten it up a bit, take some plumber's tape around the threads to get a tight fit. This seemed to work quite well and makes for a snug fit. Looks good!
B00KRXK71M|5|Just what I needed A+++
B00MG9D1G8|5|Great product at a great price.  Very heavy duty and locks in place once tightened
B004RLVZFC|5|Quickly shipping and quality item.
B00QMKYYYK|5|all the fuses that you will ever need.  great price, you get 120 for the price of 10 if bought separate.  fast shipping
B00W1WK9HE|5|sturdy
B000UKHHH4|4|Good replacement from stock. 05 XR650L
B00SZAD9S2|5|loved it
B00NZ1MINI|5|Great product for hockey goalies because you get the support when in the butterfly but you don't have to worry about the support hinge in most knee supports hitting your knee causing impact injuries to the MCL or the interior area of the knee. I started to use it after a MCL injury.  I wish I had it before the injury.  It lasts for about 7 months using it in games 4 times per week then the bar starts to pop thru the top or bottom.
B000GV5GD4|5|Installs in less than an hour. Sounds Great! I did not rejet the carb and still get 50mpg. Now wearing earplugs when we ride. I do leave for work at 5:30 in the morning and have not complained.
B00KTLVKK4|5|Ok Fit to my Honda pilot
B00CB8WM2S|5|Arrived Promptly. Items as advertised. Hi Quality, I am happy.
B001GJ9K8C|3|This wash liquid does a good job of cleaning and protecting, but it doesn't suds-up much at all, so it's hard to tell if your wash liquid is still effective.
B0013AV9B0|1|Very pleased with our purchase-came quickly & was everything it was advertised to be
B00X5TM1Z0|5|[[VIDEOID:8bad330b3e5b90203a6c4d2e88eb9ffc]] The Smart Car Kit - CAR AIR Purifier + ECO Friendly AIR Freshener + Smart Charge® USB Car Charger  is a very nice little car kit.  We were a bit \\"iffy\\" on the air purifier but in all honesty we could tell the difference once it was running for a while.  It's nice to know that you are going to have cleaner air in your car.  Especially nice for pet owners and smokers.  Also included is the Smart Charge Dual USB port car charger.  This is great with its low profile and that it can support up to 2.4A per USB port.  Overall we are more than impressed with this combo and would make a great gift for any ones car!  Comes in a nice tin as well.<br /><br />Pros<br />Price<br />Air purifier makes a noticeable difference<br />Dual USB charger is excellent.<br />Great packaging in the tin would make a good gift for someone.<br /><br />We give this a thumbs up!<br /><br />*we did receive the product at a reduced cost for our honest review.<br /><br />Luke @ Galaxy Tech Review
B00KGNKQFA|5|It's the right part for my tire machine.  It works just like the original.
B00VFEODM6|5|Bioshock Infinite is in my top list of games, recently bought this and I love it. Goes on smoothly and seems sturdy, I've only had it for about a week so I don't know how it holds up over time. Also, read the description, comes in white. I didn't read it, and was expecting black for my white car. It didn't wind up being a big deal though. I just put it on my window and it stands out fine!
B0013916XW|5|Cheap Mopar mod they should come from the factory.  These are a must have.  I think they are made in Canada, which is cool.
B00KQ81M94|5|A very good product.  Performed as advertised and expected.  Received it Friday and used it Saturday to wash my car.  Worked great.  Also really like the tube for storing the cloth.
B000F6F99G|3|the description states &#34;Requires no wiring&#34; which is incorrect.  The unit is powered by 110VAC and requires that an outlet is within about 6' of where you want to mount it.  The positioning of the lasers is limited and one actually broke out of the mount when I tried to position it - fortunately it snapped back into place.  Otherwise it works very well.  The lasers are bright and the motion sensor is sensitive.
B003KP48N2|5|Looks great! Just what I needed
B000CNJ66E|5|Here in phoenix arizona---you DO NOT need the heater when its 110 outside --(may to october).  What people dont realize is often the heater has hot water flowing through it--and that is inside the car right next to AC evaporator.  In other words, the AC has to overcome the heat of the heatercore to cool the car.  This device allows you to &#34;turn off&#34; the water going to the heater core, without removing hoses or doing any complicated plumbing.<br /><br />The car is much cooler and the AC is much colder.  Its a simple solution that works.
B00IKPGCHW|5|Works great. I think it will hold up better than the cheap plastic ones.
B003ZFJ60C|5|Cant beat original equipment!
B00GBQ3JBO|5|got them as extras just encase i forget to tighten them when we travel
B00B86EH18|5|Delivered promptly, and fit perfectly.  Easy to install, though you will have to remove the wheels.
B001763SRI|5|Great just what I needed!
B000IYR722|4|It fit my 2000 Honda Integra. I had to however put a washer over the bolt that the fan is bolted to so as to prevent the fan rubbing against the face of the replacement condenser. Once that was done it works perfect.
B00GHR9VB4|5|Great product for the price
B000E199R0|4|Nice product but the back ventshade won't cover enough space to have the window even slightly down. It does fit perfectly, but it's kinda short.
B002MQFTLU|4|it is good, thanks
B011EPYRXA|5|This remote was a much better option that spending lots of money at my local Ford dealer for a new remote.  The instructions provided were clear and simple to follow.<br /><br />I would buy this remote again if the need arose.
B003YJ8TVQ|3|rec'd as promised and as advertised
B004ISICXW|1|These gloves are not fit for motorcycle riding protection. They are at best fit for bicycle riding protection.<br />They are pretty cool but they are very thin. If they were advertised as &#34;Bicycle&#34; riding gloves I'd give them 3 or 4 stars<br />but since they try to pawn themselves off as motorcycle riding gloves this is an epic fail in my opinion.<br /><br />Spend more money, get more protection.
B000BXOGNI|5|Cleaned the ol'  electronics right up! CAUTION: Do use proper ventilation and keep away from face.
B00KKRRUR4|5|Very good quality
B008KZKDYA|5|The product is great.
B000GKD6VY|1|small for ram truck
B00AQJYF2E|1|Keyless entry will not work with my truck
B00TRFI9MK|5|I like these all-weather mats but they are made to fit on carpeting. My Ford truck has rubber flooring so the ribbed all-weather mats slide on the rubber under cover. Are there carpeted mats I can purchase to lay under the all-weather mats to keep them from sliding?
B00B2YE4B4|4|nice and bright
B0089XEB96|1|Just Junk! Not worth your hard own cash! After almost a year in the car with kids......I should have known that it would never last. Actually it was 3 months max and then it was a goner. Also, my kids hated the spell of the cheap material. It's best to buy beach towels or some type of other materials, and make your own seat covers. A good intention failed miserably!
B00YG3SOPA|5|I bought these for my sons Can Am DS70.  So far so good.  They have more cushion and grip than the stockers and the price is hard to beat.
B009MR7F64|5|Nice product
B001PWFPE8|5|Just open the tailgate and let it fall, it will slow down enough so you don't have to hold on to the tailgate.
B009DK0M7Y|4|The item is made in Taiwan, and is thinner gauge metal than OEM.<br />But, is exact replica, and fits as it should.<br />Item was packaged in a great box, but packaged loosely in box with air mailers. No Tape<br />minus one star for unsecured packing.
B00JMHGUZ6|4|It was fine but there was a problem it didn't fit the camper door. It was smaller than the door opening.
B00KW1ZEMG|5|Fast shipping. Product was just as described and work well.
B0068EUT6C|5|Awesome product! Excellent purchase!
B0001EFSTI|4|My one issue with the tool is that the edge on the micro screwdriver part is shorter in length than the standard bit but is the same width, making it too wide to actually fit in any eyeglass screws. It needs to come to a finer edge. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with it for the price. The knife part is sharper than I expected, and Utili-Key kind of &#34;locks&#34; into place in the two positions making it handier to use, but is still pretty easy to open and close.
B006WNNMNG|1|The item didn't work on my car it was the wrong part. Even when it said it fit my car. Very disappointed .
B00NFFXVRG|5|Ok
B008I7OU0S|5|Great
B0079DGNAM|5|Ok
B00ICV9PPK|5|It is beautiful
B00PBO8ALG|5|Good exelen
B00FALVU8A|5|Very nice
B00PKY3XSW|3|The shipping was great as well as the product, However instructions should have been included with the product. No fun nor have time to be Googling how to assemble.
B000JZZT7K|1|Lasted a year before it fell apart internally. Very disappointed for being a Walker product. I will be spending more money for a better quality muffler with a warranty this time around. Don't waste your money like I did mine.
B000E4N2PW|5|it fit perfectly and works great
B0009IQZPW|4|Good product
B008G2AY9G|5|Should have ordered them along time ago last half full than a buff and M D and all that other stuff that you can throw on there to sign him up best off just to go ahead and replace them money well spent
B011QFHYAQ|5|its look cool still waiting for delivery
B003EMCRQG|5|Everything expected very happy would recommend to anyone
B009B8UYIK|4|Great item.
B00JTUBTQG|5|excellent oil 、but when can i get my rebate
B000WJYMMQ|5|Everything arrived well<br /> I am a customer and I will continue buying amazon in Mexico and the United States<br /> thank you
B007GMHTQ8|3|Didn't line up on the crossbars of my 2014 Suburu Outback. The information I read and the measurements I took suggested it would.
B00LC82GZQ|5|Very easy to program works like a charm with easy to follow instructions
B008R34G6Q|5|great sticker!
B00OPMIR2M|5|Received item when promised and it works great.  Wish PSI was first of 4 selections instead of fourth.
B000HBNTGY|5|Great
B00U6NC7K2|5|Better than expected.
B00446YIYK|5|Its not really a big enough pot for my coffee dependent trucker.  But if you only need 1 mug then it'd be perfect  the road pro products we have used are excellent
B00G258I0G|4|Exactly what we were looking for!
B0048E6256|5|Looks great
B0049MKQD6|5|Works good
B000UVGIGE|4|Fits perfectly....very happy with purchase
B006DDHZ1K|5|excellent merchandise and quick delivery
B00V5D2NI8|5|Worked great...was my first timing chain install and it was pretty easy....this product fit perfectly on the 03 2.2 cavalier I was working on....
B00JIDKBY0|2|The decal does not have black numbers as represented in this picture.  It has white numbers with a clear background.  I wanted what was shown on the picture.
B009YFSO1O|5|Great product
B000HS1356|5|Time will tell but it fit well and seems to be a good cover.
B00B9PZ3L6|5|Worked well. Nice and bright.. it's on the bottom frame of bike and it stayed in place after a month so far...
B00JN0U4SQ|5|Looks fine and reception is as good as the factory antenna.
B001H3NGKA|5|My daughter needed a bandana for summer camp.  The girls are required to wear one to protect their necks at cookouts and any time they are gathered around the fire.  She is 7, so tying a bandana is not the easiest thing for her.  She felt like a pull-over bandana would be the best, and I am so glad we found this one.  It is SO SOFT, normal bandanas (like novelty ones) are scratchy and stiff.  This one is as soft as a jersey shirt, though obviously nowhere near as thick.  It stretches to give her plenty of room to pull it over her head, and it protects her from the fire.  The best part is that she can wear it many ways - oftentimes she wears it as a headband to keep the sweat off of her face.  Again, she is only 7, but it fits her fine.  I have washed it and dried it many times and it is still in great shape, still stretchy, and still feels nice and soft (even without fabric softener).  This is a great item for kids at camp.
B000CGB4QG|3|Smaller diameter than factory but works.
B00BTVTX1Q|5|Works for my x5
B006N94O5E|5|Perfect!
B00LIXZLR0|5|Not only did they ship a full week ahead of what they were supposed to. It came with everything. The heat sinks are the best I've seen. I've owned rigid industries. And these are a cheaper version. The mounts are solid.  My only disappointed review is that I ordered 2 pair. 4 lights total 3 had one size bolts. 1 had totally different sizes for some reason. But it comes with its own set of hardware to so I was still able to install with ease. The lights are a very wide and bright pattern. Very impressed
B00VGL85RW|5|Strong construction, looks great!
B007OSL3DY|5|Great safety feature for tailgates
B00KXPCSE8|1|Could not get a match no matter what I did
B00LR5YYBS|3|Initially the product seemed as though it was of good quality. After 6 months installed on my vehicle the front emblems black coating has faded and become an eye sore. I do not recommend this particular product. A little care could have been taken to fill the space with a resin to protect the finish.
B001UC55VQ|1|One year and one week after purchase, and only 4,000 miles and one of the rubber boots tore.  Buy the OEM brands so you don't have to waste money and your time changing them twice.
B00UY5DEIQ|5|great cover for the price
B000CMJ2QE|5|Could be a little cheaper but it works
B000IQ1YZG|3|it fit, its working so far
B00TUNSOMO|4|Marketed for use on boats, this is actually a quite versatile wax and will work well on your car, motorcycle, and even countertops in your house.  It does require some elbow grease, especially when it comes to removing it.  However, the results are worth it.
B007Y85FSI|4|Installed as expected and works fine.
B00BFDHTRS|5|exact replacement, works fine
B00DY6FMMI|5|wow super fast delivery !! love it !
B003CKJL14|5|This flasher was plug and play for my 1983 Yamaha XT-250. The connector plugged right on, with battery and load wires in the correct orientation. I mounted it with cable ties through the slot and around the frame. Each signal circuit on my bike has two 17 Watt lamps in parallel (6 Volt). This load gives me a flash rate of about two flashes per second with this flasher. Working great so far and it's quiet.  I may buy another just to have on hand.  Great buy!
B005GLMP3S|5|Perfect fit.
B001B4C4EY|5|needed it for refinance
B00XLZ6MBM|5|Looks great!! :D arrived before the estimated arrival time :)
B000E4PV6U|5|Great! Received part as advertised! Happy with the service/info and delivery. Highly Recommend
B0009OMYBA|2|I gave it two starts cuz I thought I would get the same as the picture but when I got it in the mail it was color red. I don't like false advertisement...
B005FN228K|4|Exactly fits in my Honda Accord. It gave entirely new look in interior. fh group seller is so fast to ship this item, worth buying it.
B00SBZRELY|5|This has got to be the coolest gadget I have purchased in a while.  Works perfectly and now I can stock 5 gallon gas tanks and not have to worry if my wife can lift them or not.
B00QMTAZ1W|4|Thanks
B005LW5OQM|4|5 stars required just a bit thicker protection
B00UVTR4VI|5|It was exactly as I expected it to be.
B00T62RK1U|5|I love this! I tested it and the beam is really bright. I won't hesitate to drive during foggy nights with my 4WD mitsubishi  pajero.
B00PCHSRLK|5|Very good product
B004H78NQ0|1|Not &#34;BMW Genuine Factory OEM...&#34; as claimed.<br /><br />Instead, I was sent a cheap lookalike from a company called Visonter, and the packaging reads:<br /><br />&#34;This is the fancy valve decorated cap with four electrons, which is made by metal material, which can instead of the original bad vale cap of the tyre, also show the beauty characteristic of the tyre.&#34;<br /><br />Does that sound like genuine BMW OEM parts to you?
B0022ZT2PK|5|My bike does not have sensors these fill the holes the sensors fit in they are chrome and do the job.
B00PV3EVRE|5|Really good
B0031GWMBU|5|Worked great in my 2005 CRV, muuuuch cheaper than a Honda factory replacement.
B00F4JOOG8|5|Quality products
B00FG5DYD4|5|Great Fit
B00BF0BLUW|3|It ok not what  I was expecting
B00KOAN6DO|3|Great packaging, but for the price, I didn't expect that it would have to be cutting of the metal involved.  It should come pre-cut ready to install!
B00062YA1C|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B000FN8H52|5|Excellent for sanding tiny areas before you use touch up paint
B00ELHNEJ2|5|Pennzoil is good oil, it is really hard and almost ridiculous saying &#34;X&#34; brand is the best, it is easier to say which ones are good or among the best. Of course I wouldn't put Autozone brand oil in a high performance engine (that is to give you an example). Now, this Pennzoil actually does something very well that I have actually noticed, it cleans engine internals quite significantly after 2-3 changes.<br /><br />I put pennzoil in a old BMW engine that had accumulated some sludge in some areas, like the bottom of the oil pan, some sludge inside the block etc. On the first change I noticed the oil being replaced was very very black and somewhat thick, second change was also very very dark and thick, I took off the oil pan to clean it and I notice it was actually pretty much clean by then, the interior of the engine was also very clean compared to what it was about 7 thousand miles before. I can't recall seeing something like this before, honestly I never had a vehicle in such poor condition to begin with. However, I did see this engine &#34;before and after&#34; and the change was significant.<br /><br />I thought it would be interesting to share that experience.
B00O799VDM|5|Fits good and look good
B00KTKV9BA|5|genuine is genuine
B00VMMGVP8|5|love it
B000ALG8LO|5|amazing stuff as always.  big size was crucial for the project i used it on.
B000E3BVT2|4|Does a really good job of covering my Wrangler 2015 spare tire. It doesnt have any flashy emblems in it so either you can customize it or leave it blank like i have.
B00G93RFZU|5|Just look at it. Of course it's awesome it's a Frenchie!
B003T05X50|2|Cheap
B005R27ZK4|5|Fast shipping, good quality. 110% satisfied.
B004P23XCQ|1|I bought mine from Auto Zone a few months ago.  Easy to put on-about 30 minutes-one person.  Unfortunately, the textured fabric shows every spec of dirt even after hand washing or going through an automated $16 car wash.  The crossbars are curved and look cheap and ridiculous. Yesterday I got tired of looking at it, decided to take the whole thing off and the side rails won't come off.  The foam insulation that &#34;protects&#34; the sides of the truck is like gorilla glue.  They weren't sticky, I guess the heat melded them on.  Maybe when Winter gets here, I can use a putty knife to pry them off but for right now, I don't want to chip or scratch my paint.  Advice-spend the $500 and get a REAL cover.
B000UVDNQM|5|on easy and looks great
B005R84EP2|5|Great value! Same helmet sells for $90.00 in stores.
B00IZR6D9C|1|Do not waste your money.  In less than 15k miles, one plug quit firing.  I could not tell any difference in performance or gas mileage.
B00CB8WM2S|5|I haven't needed to use my hammer yet, but it looks well made and like it would work well.
B00EP3PX2S|4|OK quality for the price, not as good as the ones on my previous Tundra that were also priced similar.....Definitely thinner metal tubing already a very slight dent fresh out of the box but it was on the bottom where it won't be seen. Install was plenty easy and they feel quite solid stepping on them.
B0084JLWP6|4|Satisfied
B001GH5PJC|4|Nice, quick and cheap way to add some height to the rear. I actually trimmed about a quarter of an inch off the top of these using my table saw. I wanted to try and match the front(lifted ~2.5&#34; using Bilstein 5100s). The rear is still a little higher than the front but not enough to look odd. Not the type of lift you should use if you do lots of offroading.
B00144EOOE|5|Good price.
B005F1YJ3I|5|Great quality charger which quickly and safely charges my son's Peg Perego ride on toys! WAY better than the cheap charger that comes with the toy!
B005GSFUWE|5|Much smaller than measurements given. if it looks like the old one you are replacing, it will fit.  Perfect replacement for the expired one in my Jayco trailer.
B00NLME87U|4|Excellent quality cover for the $ and fit my 2013 Subaru BRZ perfectly.  I rated 4 star instead of 5 as they do not disclose in the description the &#34;MOTOR TREND&#34; lettering printed on the front of the cover.  Not a huge deal for me in regard to the functionality of the product, but a fairly significant detail not disclosed prior to purchase.
B000WEKPG8|2|It didn't fit very good on my 2006 tundra limited. The window wouldn't roll all the way up without binding at the top. Had to shave some of the material off with a grinder, to get the window to roll up. And chipped a little corner piece trying to install them. Im pretty handy when it comes to installing things, and these didn't go very smoothly.
B00JQ5RBXE|1|These center caps are still changing colors, hate these parts.
B0006PY0M8|5|'Gooder' than the old one, new again.
B008GWRB1K|5|Nice product
B00KWNMARQ|5|Love it, great value!
B00FALVU8A|5|Great if you need a quick way product. Try layering it for killer results.
B000E7WLJW|4|Fits a lot in, but it's much too small for the Curt 18100 Aluminum Cargo Carrier that it's recommended to purchase with.
B000EBKG90|5|easy to use. works very well and does keep the car cooler.
B0040Y301S|4|overall pretty good hvlp for clearcoat and basecoat!
B000EQRJW2|5|No programming needed. Works great! Good price. Easy to install on my 2007 H2
B00GIYFJXK|5|Great quality. Keeps its appearance over long periods of time Nice glossy finish. Very good.
B00BGEQU6C|3|OK quality for the price, the pack itself is as expected, small and light, pocket is small, can barely fit wallet, phone and keys, the water bladder clips onto a hook at the inside top but the clip/hook connection is designed in a way that makes it more difficult then it should be.
B00FH8P1DG|4|Did not fit to long need to send back can't find information for return to company please help need information.
B00L842Y5Q|5|Just like OEM
B008Z2EZRY|5|A++
B005Y1RA62|3|Fit great
B00176QVZ4|5|Good quality.
B00EVYOUCU|5|replacment retainer for headlight lamp.worket great for mercedes.
B005NHIDGS|5|Works and fits as expected on 2006 Crown Victoria.  Only issue (not that I care) it is a slight shade of green off.
B00NJK9O3C|5|After trying several fat, fancy wipers, I forgot how small wiper blades can be, like the stock blades. This is thin but work very well and quietly. It's also easy to install and inexpensive.<br /><br />Wiper blades should be replaced more often than you'd imagine. Even if you don't use much, the rubber portion wears out due to sun damage. Since you have to replace wiper blades somewhat regularly, you might as get one which works well but is also affordable.
B002YKBPXA|2|returned. arrived filthy. like it had knocked some dirty tires.
B004AH6OXQ|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 Nissan Maxima.  Very affordable price, but shipping took 3 weeks.
B000IYSKAK|5|Fits perfec
B00JRZH2NM|1|Very soft alum so some bolts stripped out didn't come with instructions very bad product wouldn't recommend
9539752639|5|this service and the product is excellent
B00VDQNELW|5|This thing fits perfect. Mine doesn't have the problem with sliding off when I open the console that some others seem to have. It's got a little padding that makes it comfy for resting my elbow on, but does a great job protecting the console from my dog scrambling over it when she's getting into the backseat.
B001DF9PSY|5|Perfect. The item arrived quickly.
B007J7G1TG|4|So far so good in for 8 months and still working.My only complaint is that 1 was a dud guy at the dealership switched to every plug and it missed every time but you still can't beat that price they look like they are very well made
B00YTCR6ES|5|Fast shipping good stuff!!
B0022ZXO40|5|allows me to strap items onto passenger seat of my motorcycle easily
B001OZQEI2|5|Great price for this great Lucas oil. And it was delivered on time with Prime.
B007GMQF90|5|There are so many different types. materials. and brands of sun shields for windshields, that it is difficult to make an informed purchase unless you've actually had experience with a particular shield, especially given the inconsistencies in the ratings and reviews of these products. This is the one to buy. It is: (1) well made and durable, and holds up to constant use; (2) it fits your vehicle perfectly; (3) it works extremely well; (4) it is quick and easy to put in, remove, and stow (I find the multi-panel folding shields much easier to handle and stow than the roll-up type); and (5) it looks like a quality custom accessory (I do not like the look of the super reflective &#34;tin foil&#34; and cheap looking outer layer on many of the shields).
B000OAEN7C|1|This product did not work for me. I've had issues with my 98 Legacy GT2.5 leaking oil from the valve cover caskets and instead of replacing them for a 3rd time I thought I would try it. Did as instructed, ran 2 hrs, then ran 2 hrs the next day, then ran 1 & 1/2 hrs the next day, then drove it the rest of the week. NO CHANGE and still leaking after 3 weeks. Bought valve cover gaskets yesterday, this time I'll replace them myself.
B00AV8HSA6|5|Works great with my Honda rebel. I will never use a floor jack again
B002OMXSPG|1|Nice door but within 6 months the lock was seized. wont be buying another one
B00GMRM3KA|5|Fits perfectly on 2015 jeep jk and is crazy bright.  %300  improvement over stock.  Thing i had to purchase was anti flicker harness.  Installation was very easy too.
B000GV4ZNQ|5|beautiful
B00UMJR8CM|5|Excellent product.
B00XAX4B9A|5|Great product! Keeps my car cooler in this South Texas heat!
B0090DXBEK|5|Works exactly as described. I got this cut at the dealership for $10 and programmed it myself with instructions of the internet. Turned a hundred some odd dollar job from the dealership into an easy do it yourself job.
B00B86GIJW|5|Delivered promptly, and fit perfectly.  Easy to install, though you will have to remove the wheels.
B001J7CO02|5|These are great, I love em and so does Amtrak since I was doing about 70 or so and we were blowing our horns back and forth to each other, had a good time with it!
B009PVFYVU|5|Fits very well right out of the box. I am very impressed with the quality of the leather that was used on the boot. It is very soft and looks great.
B0009I2OIE|5|Ideal fix for Chryslers Stingy way of installing a trailer hitch.  I received my wiring kit in a very timely manner.  The instructions included were clear and precise, any one should be able to follow the directions. Everything works perfectly.  Now I have a usable trailer hitch.
B00AQTAWEY|4|I've been lusting after one of these little jump packs since they were introduced. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on it, but I wanted a decent product. I've been dropping hints around my birthday, but alas one never materialized. Evidently, I'm not the only cheapskate in the family. I'm familiar with Tenergy and have used their rechargeable batteries and chargers for years so I had no reservations that this would be a quality product.<br /><br />When it arrived, I charged it using the plug in wall charger. It took about 7 hours to reach a full charge. The manufacturer claims a 3 hour charge time.  Once it was charged I set about seeing how it performed.<br /><br />Cellphone and tablet had no issues charging through USB and devices could be used while being charged. The tablet is a Winbook TW801. They recommend the 1 amp port for phones and the 2 amp port for tablets. Most modern smartphones have no problem charging with a 2 amp source and charge about 20% faster so I used the 2 amp outlet for both devices. After the tablet was charged, I used it for about an hour with this plugged in and it stayed at 100% charge so imagine this works as a great battery extender. The Tenergy was down to some where between 50 and 75% charge after messing around with tablets and phones so I put it back on the wall charger. It took a little over an hour to fully recharge.<br /><br />The flashlight isn't very bright, but it's better than nothing if you don't have one handy and it will probably work for a good 24 hours.<br /><br />And now for the main event... will it start my 3.9L Dodge Dakota?<br />To simulate a dead battery I disconnected the positive terminal on the truck battery. Then I connected the Tenergy unit to the negative terminal on the battery, and positive cable I disconnected from the battery. The engine started right up off only the power from the Tenergy. I turned the key off and repeated the procedure after making sure all was good under the hood. Four status lights were lit after those 2 jumps, indicating it had between 75 and 100% charge remaining. It took about 20 minutes to recharge it off the wall charger. I don't recommend you repeat my test method because electronic circuitry can be easily damaged. But I just had to know if it would work because jump starting is the only reason why I purchased this device.<br /><br />I just hate standing outside in the middle of winter waving my jumper cables hoping some good samaritan will stop. And it's almost as bad when you are that good samaritan and have to position your vehicle so the jumper cables will reach. Sometimes it can't even be done without applying some serious muscle to move the disabled vehicle. With this device, all you have to do is be able to open the hood.<br /><br />The main things I don't like about this unit is that the charging time is understated and there isn't an explanation of the status lights. It has 4 status lights. I assume each one represents 25% charge so if only one is lit the most it can have is 25% charge. If 2 are lit it between 25 and 50% charge and so on. When plugged into the charger the status light that indicates the current level of charge will start flashing and then become solid when it reaches that level. The case is large and bulky but the unit itself and the cables are small enough to fit into my glove compartment or center console. I don't recommend keeping it in the vehicle all the time if you live in an area with temperature extremes.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.hts were lit after those 2 jumps, indicating it had between 75 and 100% charge remaining.

B00G0Q1ST0|5|It's what I want. Easy to install.
B00F9LPIAC|5|I am using the battery for my scooter. It is half the volume and a third the weight of a lead-acid battery. Pads are provided to make up the difference. With proper maintenance it should last 10-15 years.
B004YEJ7E8|5|Great!!!
B004ZF3DYG|5|Received brand new H11 bulb wiring harness and ballast for my 2011 camry. They worked just as I had planned. Excellent customer service, best all around. If you have any issues with your lights just give Kensun a call.
B007P05IH8|5|Okay box that takes advantage of dead space, and cleans up stray stuff that floats around.  Mine holds a toolkit, 3 qts oil, 1 gal antifreeze, my jumper cables and a heavy towstrap.  All that fits without difficulty, and best of all is at my tailgate, not buried under a load.  The plastic is thin, but not flimsy - sort of a thin rubbermaid actionpacker type.  Mine is inside my locked shell, which is good because the lock on the box offers pretty much zero protection.  All in all, a plastic box shaped to fit over a wheelwell.
B00I6MP6CQ|4|All good apart from the e brake shoe retainer clips are different to standard and don't fit and the pins that go with the retainers are made of a soft cheese. Ended up reusing the old ones. The rest of the kit was fine. Even came with all the right greases and lubes in little packets!
B001B7C1VW|5|Accumulator is holding charge and working great. No issues putting in my 07 ram 2500 5.9
B00H0DXPW0|5|Insanely bright and durable.  Length listed is not accurate though, about 53&#34; between the centers of each mounting brackets
B00627N41W|5|good deal! quick delivery!  A++++++
B00KJ8L6BK|5|Just purchased and was installed in about 30mins. Because my car wiring was reversed, the connector doesn't fit as snug but with a zip tie it was no issue at all. Went right into the factory lens with no modifications on a '09 Toyota Camry. So far much improved light.<br /><br />Picture isn't the best but you get the idea, a much whiter light than factory bulb. Would recommend.
B0055F50UU|4|Works great in our e-track.  Really well made.  Allows us to use a softer more flexible rope to do tie downs that the standard ratchet straps do.
B00HJ1592C|3|I loved this , however within a few weeks the black part of the shoe was missing...first one then both.  Gradually the &#34;bling&#34; is starting to come off also...so basically it looks like I have the chrome outline...with bling here and there.
B009W5O6LS|3|i love the rear stand! definitely helps for cleaning chain, removing rear tire etc, but i cant say for the front, unfortunately the front stand will not work which is lame, it almost catches the triple tree hole but it just wont work. :/
B008F07OMO|5|worked perfect!!
B00VTCKDKA|5|Ok
B00WJ08ZP6|4|It looks very nice! And well made! I would give it 5 stars If it came with  the o-ring
B00KOW3SN0|4|Great
B00HSTIZQW|1|Big Disappointment.  Poorly made. Didn't last after a few car washes.  Fades and peals.
B000C16XK8|5|The part arrived in 2 days and cost me about $20 less than 3 different local shops wanted.  It took me under an hour to install this and now I don't have to worry about my windows being stuck up or down.  Good deal here.
B00BUHVYMU|5|All the parts I needed
B00DQD3PU0|5|Solid and sturdy. Fit perfectly
B00757KJTI|1|This was the one of the worst purchases I've ever made. The reception is terrible
B0083W16SM|5|I just installed this carb yesterday and it works .
B00OCGCU6K|5|very bright and nice lights.I would buy them again and again, Very satisfied!!
B00A82M7YW|4|No problems, here.  This replacement battery came promptly, and I've been using it for over a month with no issues.
B00BCH4WTA|5|Not a perfect spray (Still leaks at the handle like most bottles when you are spraying a lot), but its a very strong spray that shoots a lot of fluid at once. The nozzle, when open, provides a strong, consistent spray, and I would say twice the strength as a windex bottle.<br /><br />I literally dyed my lawn green during a snowstorm in feb using this. A++
B000VKY3I4|1|doesnot work
B009GO6CYO|5|Great product. Yes it is slow, but that's perfectly fine. I installed it on my car hauler. The jack and winch are run off a deep cycle battery with a solar tender. The only thing I needed to change was the since my battery isn't grounded to the frame, so I ran a ground wire from one of the mounting bolts back to the negative side of the battery and it works perfectly. I'll be ordering another for my travel trailer soon.
B003G54MOG|5|great product
B009IFIETM|1|wasn't the right part that I needed a total failure.
B00CMUDOHW|5|Us expected
B003HNUA34|3|There okay they do the job but it's like a cheap plastic but there hanging on :-)
B00P03Q8F8|3|do not suggest leaving this in the car when it gets warm out, does some weird things. but it worked great before that
B0002NYDYO|5|Gets out the old grease while putting in new grease, can't imagine an easier way of repacking the bearings!
B00SQ2GEJA|5|It was in perfect condition and works great. Easy to install.
B002MQCYO0|5|This product is awesome!  Wish it was cheaper.
B00KQHJDB4|4|unknown this were for my shop inventory, haven't used it yet but looks good so have no reason to down grade.
B00YBZWKRQ|5|Great harness. Wish it came unconnected and the switch wasn't connected to the harness, getting the wires off for install wasn't easy, but it has plenty of length and the included 40amp fuse was nice. Only note that the distance between the two output wires to the lights don't cover a great distance from each other so the lights could only be about 4 feet away from each other.
B005INZ7Z2|1|No mounting hardware on the back of multiple returns.
B00JGP8I1S|1|It shakes the whole time you are driving and there is a reflection of the things behind you..  Makes driving very distracting.
B000W0RQ8C|5|Works well
B00HLW18T2|5|Excelent product
B000COCOBW|5|Best brakes ever for my 2005 STi. The car stops wayyyyyy quicker than it ever did with stock brake pads. I feel like I can stop from 60 to 0 within 2 seconds.
B00KN0UOEE|5|As a former designer/builder/tester of experimental technology and equipment for a private company that supplied various private and government entities, including NASA, I often find myself drawn to those products that reach the civilian sector from such sources. This one is quite handy.<br /><br />As a mundane example: Wipe down the glass in your shower with one of these wipes shortly after cleaning it thoroughly. Poof! No more water spots on the glass when you shower. How cool is that! And, it significantly increases the time between cleaning as it also prevents mildew.<br /><br />Give 303 a try, and feel free to experiment. Who knows what awesome new use you may find for this interesting product. At least now you have a household use so your wife will let you buy it. ;-)<br /><br />How fun it is to live in the infancy of the space age enjoy!
B006MX7ZRK|2|The front seats for good, but don't waste you money on the back. They are just universal covers. They also have taken about 2 months to get the weird rubber smell out of the car.  Just spend the extra money for the ones that actually fit your car.
B004DRXY9A|5|These lights are awesome. Shopping was great and exactly what I ordered. I went on YouTube to find out how to install them. It was a bit of a challenge but no terrible..
B00CPYC9BC|5|fast shipping product as advertised
B007IVR7I2|5|Easy to install, looks good was a good price
B0013REXSO|5|5 min installation and fits perfectly.
B002OUMVWY|5|The rhino flex hose work great.
B00KZCM4EI|5|Nice appearance and very easy to self install. All hardware and instructions included.
B00IFTFEIQ|5|Great product! Fit well on my 2014 MTS, and the finish is excellent. At over 1/2 the cost of the Ducati branded version, it's a great value.
B0086I9N2E|5|Awesome product at great price.
B002IC986A|1|Part has crack and didn't work
B0002Q81WG|5|This bracket has a slot opening in the bottom that allows for replacement without having to take the plug wiring apart. A great idea that seems very obvious but until now but apparently wasn't.
B00H1DOHTY|4|It was delivered in a hot delivery truck, so it was all melted, but put it in the fridge for a while to let it solidify to it's standard room-temperature state before using so you don't over-apply it.<br /><br />This is expensive for how small of a tub you get, but it's definitely going to last the life of my Brooks saddle.
B00839V21Q|5|Love them. Look great in my car. SOX NATION!!!
B00ATXEPQI|5|This is my second one.. My Son took mine.  It works well. We don't overload it with equipment, only cell, something my Boy listens to music on...<br />Hasn't failed us yet. It charges in a timely manner.<br />I recommend this product.
B007UTPUDQ|3|on low setting ball scrapes should have top only like the normal hitch
B00U6YTMRM|5|works wonderfully, I would recommend it !!!
B000B5QFE4|5|Fantastic product, Fit perfect on my 08 FX4 F150 Super Crew, Easy to install.
B00DQUA466|5|I absolutely love it.
B00ABYVTZA|5|Fits the std home depot bucket, works as expected
B00ZGGORFM|5|The alarm work excellent it hooked up perfect on my 1999 harley sportster everything worked excellent on it. everything works perfect.
B003XGYDE2|5|Good for bike tires and touching up car tires.  The pressure gauge is very helpful and reasonably accurate.  At first I didn't think I would like the screw-on connector but I find it very easy to use without losing much air  -- just hold pressure while turning the screw knob.  It's not real speedy filling car tires but the 120V power makes it much faster than battery-powered models --  and all you are doing is just watching thee gauge, rather than pumping!
B00FODHWAO|5|Amazing light bar. Easy installation. Several different selectable patterns. Solid design.
B001R5XR7A|1|Jobar
B003N9MQCK|5|These are huge, much bigger than I thought they would be, better value IMO. Great
B001MOVPO8|5|good spares
B00BTGSID0|5|Not the largest and most plush towels which I needed for different purpose.  Holds water well, picks up rubbish and dust well, washes easily.  That's what I needed from these towels.  I didn't need the really plush ones although I did get some for different reasons.  Nice towels.
B00B2AFHJG|5|Works just fine
B00TWOFAKA|5|Excelent!!
B00W8JJ20U|5|Love it
B00JR4D70K|5|Perfect!
B003JID6U6|5|This is a monster.  Rated to pull anything i have to put behind my truck.  Ive only used it a couple time to pull a car trailer but work as it should . My guess it did not know it have anything behind it.
B000CO7QLK|5|Easy to use and includes everything needed to convert the car's A/C system from Freon to R134-A.
B000CONU1K|5|Fits perfectly! 100% good condition! 👍
B00523AMBC|1|Unless this doesn't come with a filter in it already, it's worthless....I have cloudy water from a pipe that is leaking in our development and after I hooked this up and run water through it, it's still cloudy  Camco 40631 EVO Premium Water Filter
B001OMVCIC|4|The product is great and works perfectly but DO NOT follow the instructions. If you insert the air bag all the way into the spring, let it inflate and then try to hook up the air line as the directions state it is almost impossible. I spent more time trying to get the air line onto the first bag then the rest of the install put together. On the second side I got the airbag halfway into the spring and stopped. I installed the air fill nozzle onto one end of the air line, inserted the top protective disk into the coil and strung the airline through and connected it to the airbag. You have to be quick in taking off the cap and putting on the airline, but with the air nozzle installed on the other end it won't inflate. Then you can install the rest of the bag, inflate it and zip tie the air line into place and you're done. I did the second side this way in less than 25% of the time for the first side. I ran the separate lines for each bag to a small hole on either side of my hitch, the kit came with all of the hardware to secure it into the hole and it is a very clean installation.<br /><br />5 stars for the product but 4 stars overall for the bad directions.
B00FRHOGU6|5|Can't go wrong with Rain X.  Installed for my rear windshield on my DC5 and it works great.  Amazon had very fast shipping as always.  Recommended!
B001DC1VUM|1|HORRIBLE. Had too much oil on it, which got onto the mass airflow sensor for my Cadillac XLR. Kept setting off my &#34;check engine&#34; light for 2 years (even after I cleaned the MAF sensor)! Threw them away and replaced with paper filters.
B00IUWM59O|5|Good replacement for my 2009 Kawasaki Ninja 250r<br />It's a bit taller than the original battery so the terminal cables were snug under the top bracket that holds it in place.
B000C541SK|5|Quality replacement part
B000GTUM9O|3|This windshield is decent for the price I paid.  It does shake quite a bit when riding over bumpy roads, but it helps keep the wind off my chest and makes it easier to stay of the bike.
B00G9W9O3C|4|Fits just right on my '15 Suzuki WeeXT.  stays on tight and the &#34;snaps&#34; work well because you need to undo them every time you fill up for fuel.  the construct seems pretty hefty and the &#34;lid&#34; is a usable comfiguration.  It is a pain to fit a map in and trying to read a phone or GPS sitting under the cover in the provided pocket is a bit of a loss... the clear plastic is just to glare producing.<br /><br />The loss of a star is because the weather cover just doesn't fit well... and on my bike the wind screen creates a low pressure area just where the bag sits and lifts the weather cover right off.
B00IPS4APU|1|Did not work for my small chip damage
B007UTNI4O|4|sealed my exhaust header leak.... ZZ383 w/D-port heads.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Work great good quality
B000AM8BLI|5|Popped right into my car and now the lights work again!  I like not having to take a special trip to an auto parts store for something small and cheap like this, worked out great
B0000AZ7EY|5|Beautifully made item, but does not fit the harbor freight red folding utility trailer. You need 2 1/16 inch.
B007KCY566|5|Great fit
B00QMTAZ1W|4|Works good and well made. tabs need connectors. not solderable.
B00873J0YY|4|You have to assemble yourself..
B00JJ3R8RC|5|Capitalism made this high quality sticker. Think about that.
B002BS40X2|3|Quality is not bad , but size was not fit .<br />I am always wearing large size but this vest was smaller than usual so you better order bigger size
B00AHOQJYU|5|Fit on a 2001 VW Jetta 1.8T MKIV.<br /><br />Snug fit, use sandpaper to make it flush with the rotor.  And remember to use air tool to take them off and put them on, makes it a breeze.
B00BCRMBSO|2|Front seat fit and work good back seat don't fit
B005JU5W54|5|Ordered these after the RainX blades of the same size weren't compatible with my 2010 Honda CRV. These fit perfectly! The curvature if perfect for my windshield, they are super quiet too. The price is double what other blades cost so I hope they last.
B00A8MZ7EY|5|One of the best clays that I've ever used. The spray works well but dyes your fingers blue.
B00KTJ0A0C|5|They came to my house with free shipping and on time. Took only 2-3 minutes to program. I would tell anyone about this  deal, as I already have.works better than  the old remote did.
B000BY6HCA|5|Arrived on time and fits perfectly.
B00ATTQV2S|5|So far so good.
B00C1CS27I|5|Excellent price, arrived well packaged and on time, works as advertised.
B004HYSITA|5|Great! fits on 2006 silverado and covers the tailgate holes.
B0041CCBOG|5|I have the Freewheeler Trike, and this is a tad large.  But good quality.
B0030B2N10|1|Did not last long.  Too much trouble to keep charging it up.  It finally bit the dust.  I gave it to my son for parts for his All-in-one which is still working.
B00WVJRM5E|5|I normally don't leave reviews on products although i heavily rely on them when I'm making purchases. I, like most people was a little hesitant with this, but I'm glad I pulled the trigger. I installed it on a 2011 Suzuki GSXR-600 and it fit PERFECTLY!! A buddy of mine has HID'S on his GSXR and my lights were brighter and three times less the price. I initially ordered the H7 for the daytime running lights to test it out. After seeing how bright these things are I am going to buy the H9's for my highs. If you're on the fence, but it- you won't regret it.
B001EP2904|5|Just a rubber hitch cover; nothing much to it.  Hope it stays put.
B005HR28OW|3|Slips. Kinda gets in the way if you have big phands at all.
B0062A7M2G|3|In the product Description it says you need to order in 12&#34; sections, so I thought I was getting one continuous roll, but I received two rolls.
B002G3PHSE|5|Excellent replacement wipers. Very happy with purchase. Recommend.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Very impressed with how easily these shades cling and remove. You can literally slap it against the window and it holds. no wrinkles from folding. Re-position-able with very little effort. It could block the sun a little better, but it definitely gets the job done. Kids complain less about the sun in their faces during long car rides and hot seats while getting in the car.
B005NA6FJ2|5|Cooler Vehicle Fo SHO!
B003ZS8VB4|5|Great price and easy install!
B004NV4E2W|4|Pretty much an exact replacement from the stock ones. Fits and works fine.
B001IH8PXI|5|Awesome locking systen, I feel my trailer is secure with it and it would take a lot for someone to attempt to break it.
B00VXZZY5C|5|The best oil in the world! Personally experienced Russian trucks in Siberia 3 years. The motors do not eat oil !!!
B000I1E7P0|5|Good price!  It's over $65 on the Snap-On truck!!!!
B0066CP786|4|Hubby uses it in his semi.  Pretty good overall.  Wish it moved a little more air.
B004Z1J6XM|4|works great fit f150 05 4x4 perfect with leveling kit
B00YI3IGA6|5|Went on with ease and keeps my baby and my puppy shaded during the those times when the sun is shining right through the back windows. Totally forgot that I had it on when I went through the car wash and it went through like a champ.
B00P5YOU3O|1|The emblem &#34;benzy&#34; for hubcaps look nice. They are too large to fit into the center depression of the wheel cover and had to be trimmed down to seat properly. Being an item that is suggested to be ordered along with the wheel covers, I was surprised to find that the emblem did not fit easily into the center depression of the wheel cover and had to be modified.
B00LZWAZFC|5|I like
B0038AV8Z0|5|These shipped fast and arrived fast..extremely well packaged.<br />No problems at all installing, and appear to be a high quality product..The new lights in the dark mountains are very much better.
B001BDJY5M|5|looks real cute on my new car... metal, won't break, glad to have it
B005F3ZEZS|3|This is a preliminary review.  I have had this Anchor mount in my car for a couple weeks now and I'm not entirely certain that it's working out any better than the other inexpensive aftermarket mounts out there (DEA, Eagle, Febest, Motorking, etc), which gave me headache after headache.<br /><br />This Anchor mount exhibits a lot of lateral movement under acceleration and gear changing, even though the other engine mounts were replaced at the same time as this one.  Additionally, it did not come with the rubber &#34;wings&#34; on the side as shown in the picture, which is fine...unless the rubber fails completely and the mount starts to make metal-to-metal contact, which is what those pads are supposed to prevent!<br /><br />I do like that Anchor included a counterweight/damper, which the other &#34;cheap&#34; transmission mounts eliminate, but it's rubber, not cast metal like the stock mount, so I doubt it's as effective.<br /><br />I will update this shortly with my findings as I plan to inspect the mount again in the next few days after a bit more driving.
B00EIIMDZA|5|as expected
B00FFI7UAU|2|Not so much liked
B0051WVPB0|5|works great
B007BKFB1A|5|very good quality .<br />thank you
B00UNTU3VO|5|I received the Car duster yesterday and I was very much impressed, it was more than I expected. It makes the job of removing dust quick and is an excellent tool for removing the dust in those hard to reach places.
B0002U2V1Y|5|Excellent Product.
B000PA03AC|5|Perfect! Had best buy install it in a 06 mini.
B000RXKR6M|4|Makes washing a breeze.
B004R33UH6|5|fits 2006 f350
B00L1RUUZQ|5|Served the purpose intended
B005DM2NN2|3|kinda expensive for what you get
B00V4049K2|5|For a 13-year-old car that ferries around a toddler and a dog, my car is now amazingly fresh. Thanks for making my car not embarrassing.
B0067UF5R0|5|Easy to install and it does the job.  the entire engine is now more secure and doesn't vibrate anymore.
B004K23IP8|5|Just what I needed for my 12'000 lb winch. Thank you
B002M495QM|5|A quality replacement for the factory headlights.  The old ones were yellow and didn't project anymore.  For the price, these can't be beat.  The only recommendation is to not forget to align the headlights when you're done.
B004V4GRYY|5|I love them in the car my husband surprised me with for our 20th anniversary. They made it look extra special!!!!
B00Q3JTUDU|5|Easy fit for F350 truck. Secure grip on original steering wheel rim. Requires moderate effort to slip- fit.
B0068EO7S8|5|As a female rider, I was looking for comfort, performance and like Goldilocks, just the right size; this grip fits the bill as I found my stock grips to be a bit large. (I'm 5'5&#34;.) Additionally, with the &#34;bat wing,&#34; I don't have to roll my entire hand on the throttle (just my palm) and one definitely does not need the throttle boss. Take care, though, the &#34;bat wing&#34; may take some getting used to as I can tell you when I went to pick the bike up after installation, my palm naturally rested on the wing and (oops) the bike moved forward towards traffic (whoa, nelly!). But, seriously, this was not really an issue after a small adjustment of the angle on which they were installed.<br />Also, please note that the rubber is more of a charcoal gray vs. black, which is what I was expecting, and this alone may be a deal breaker for some.
B00KOHHLTW|5|2012 dyna wide glide stock set up<br />I spoke to the Vance And Hines representative at the Sturgis rally and asked him too many newb questions.  He was patient and informative.  I have a limited budget when it comes to bike upgrades so I do things in stages.  His suggestion was to start here as I move to stage 1 upgrades.  It will improve stock set up and allow me to avoid harley flash fees as I upgrade exhaust and air cleaner.  They were diing a brisk buisness with these little wonders.<br />Everything they claim seems to be accurate.  Very clean and direct setup.  Map hiice is easy and clear.  Flash was fast but it seemed longer than it was.  I was afraid of drastic idle changes; no need to worry.  Rep recomended that I run stock map for a whole tank of gas before I run auto tune.  Stock map gave me more power without sacrificing fuel economy.  Popping in decel was almost nonexistent.  I had some slight popping but I only noticed because I was listening specifically for this.<br />Nice product.  Easy to use for someone who is new to the whole pricess of upgrades.
B00KQPOSQ6|5|Love this mat! Makes for a great place to play for my toddler boys under the awning at campsites. Easy to clean and helps keep some sand and dirt out of the camper. Drys well after rain too.
B003E60T6M|5|First I thought It was gonna take a while to get here , but 2 days and I found it on my door step .It's definitely Hella OEM quality , Packaging is amazing . ( Don't waste your time buying cheap fan clutch I bought one for $ 25 and I took off my E39 when I red on a forum that it destroyed someones car) Also if you decided to buy if from Auto zone , its gonna be $150 orally is the same price and they are not even Hella . This is Gonna be Hella Good . I will update after installing it today.
B000C44CRQ|5|Worked great on my Excursion.  Great price and fast shipping.
B01015G0BQ|4|These things look great. The s***ty thing was I received two left side ones with it. But the company came through after I contacted them. Immediately sent me the right one. They have the perfect smoked look and not that euro alteeza look.
B00SVEQPRE|5|Nice quality ,nice color
B00RUEDCG8|5|These fit perfectly onto my bike right where the old one was. The last cover broke and the rubber was falling apart so I thought it was time to replace them. It's a good light!
B007PUVYDK|5|Works well!
B002YI72TS|5|Already bought more!!! Does better than others I have used!!
B0000WVV6A|3|Okay product, not as sturdy as I expected.
B0002U2V1Y|5|&#34;Rusty&#34; spots on my 2015 appeared after winter & was recommended to clay bar the car. Bought this kit & after a couple hours had all the spots removed, just took some muscle.
B005DL7XII|5|Good product and fitment
B00JY8L6WU|5|I really enjoy these and may get a couple more. Added to the kids go-kart and what a difference, 2 is all you need but with 2 more I may be able to sit in the house at night and know where they are:)
B00CC2ZU4K|1|Box stop working I need to get a new box, warranty 2 years but I can't contact them
B0067ED49C|5|Its an oil filter, works as expected
B00BWAKYIU|2|I bought this as a gift & the only thing that I  received was 50ft of GT Mat nothing else read the add now I won't have time to return it before birthday very mad thanks alot!!!
B006RMMN3M|5|The dash in my old car has never been so bright. I highly recommend these to anyone with an old muscle car.
B00D7TD7VU|5|It is cute and I am hoping dangerous at the same time.
B00BQFRV5A|1|No instructions...wadded up old newspaper in pockets.....the metal support tab was very rough and sharp on one end...put DEEP scratches in corner of windshield when installing. Seller will not assist with new wwindshield. Would look elsewhere for any motorcycle items.
B00ONHW10S|4|Perfect fit
B00BTGSIA8|1|These are terrible. Even after washing them 3 times, they leave lint on windows and all over my car. Also, if you use them with anything strong like rubbing alcohol, bug/wax/tar remover, or adhesive remover the color from the towels will bleed all over your car and stain it. I tried using them with both rubbing alcohol and 3m adhesive remover to remove adhesive when I took the badges off my trunk. Now there are big bright green stains on my white paint of my brand new 2016 WRX. Hopefully the stains will come off with a good buffing.
B0002MG5M8|5|Worked fixed my refer thanks!!
B00M8UHSX2|4|Very stylish and easy to install
B00LO0M918|5|Exactly as described
B000GZICLS|5|on time and fit perfect. Looks great
B002UX7INM|5|I replaced my 10 year old original equipment bulbs with these - wow what an improvement in nighttime visibility.
B00IAZ692A|5|highly recommend
B00BCRMBSO|4|this car seat cover is fit to my Honda pilot 2006
B00SDNY0MU|5|I am so excited when my lights came they fit perfectly and we're exactly how they were described on the site I would recommend anyone to purchase these lights as they add a next level of beauty to my vehicle. Great product.
B0054RW1HE|5|Love them. Yea there is a whistle but when you are going 45 plus with the doors off I just don't give a crap. You can barely hear it and if it bothers you so much then others on here have mentioned cheap and great fixes.<br /><br />I personally leave mine on all the time and fold them up towards the front windshield. Works great like that and is always on for quick usage.
B00C0SQPOA|1|Using it on a rowing shell. One of the lights stopped working after one week.
B00LE0Z2XA|5|Love it
B00K1C1WC2|5|excellent
B00LEZTNIA|1|Sent it back would not work on my motorcycle rate it a 1 star
B008PWLQA8|1|Never came with the cover
B002UC19T2|5|We bought this for our Motorhome water filter and we are super happy with the taste of the water and there is no odor in the water flow.
B000H0ORRA|5|Really doing a good job of making my country roads brighter. a lot of deer out at night.
B005ADVNNK|5|😀
B00DORCEPU|4|Good oil for the price. Would have gave it 5 stars, but can't find the oil rating. I think this oil has been discontinued or replaced by another product from the manufacturer.
B00I5CRHQA|5|Nice window stickies to complete my camo-mobile!
B004A2GOK4|5|great product.
B00GI77E2Q|2|I wanted something that would be durable and visible. These are probably durable, but they're barely noticeable during the day. As a result I have a much harder time changing lanes. I'm switching back to regular bulbs until I can find something better.
B0058A55SY|2|Very small windshield not what I was expecting
B008CH9JAA|1|Missing parts
B00684TAYY|5|I was very skeptical that this would actually work my older Maxima (2002). But sure enough, my 19 year old on read and followed the instruction (turn the lock, lock the door, .....??) and it worked.<br /><br />The cost for a replacement at the dealership was nearly $100, so this was a great deal and has been working fine. I would buy again if needed.
B000ST5AY4|5|Work Great
B005ERWC1O|5|Turned off that annoying &#34;Check engine&#34; light and reduced my fuel consumption to almost half.
B0012H6HMK|4|They are so cool just really short!
B004I0IEV0|5|Great product! No quality issues and fast delivery.
B00SOH7VCQ|4|WARNING....The wire is terribly small like maybe 24 gauge wire. Hard to connect them to anything with connectors. I put 4 of them for reverse lights and they are ridiculously bright. I haven't checked them all but the first 4 I pulled out the pack worked just fine.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Product arrived earlier than expected and is working great.
B006NES8XS|5|Look great, easy to install<br />Great value
B009T9DE06|5|3rd row floor mat fits great in my 2011 Ford Flex.
B0101U6OVW|5|Great sticker and getting lots of Thumbs Ups!
B002OUMU66|3|Didn't come with wiring directions but fortunately I found a video on u-tube that was a big help.  One of the screws was stripped.
B00ASMZYIS|5|Great price. Great battery.
B005O530W6|5|Great helmet and fits true to size. Graphics are gold and red. Hearts and Butterfly. Can not beat price anywhere.
B00CFBVAX8|5|Worked great// great deal too
B00PJATOSU|5|Extremely well made. Thick and heavy. Excellent quality and should last for a long time.
B005HR3DYQ|5|Was the right fit and a very bright
B003SZ89Y8|5|arrived on time and it worked fine
B00TEG79T6|5|Great
B001G6AUKC|5|Learned how to do this on YouTube and the piece fit perfectly.  Took longer to jack up the car than it took to replace the unit.  Now no clunks in the transmission.
B008Y32R1A|4|Good value for the price
B0058W986C|5|It made the girlfriend stop whining about her seatbelt so I consider it a win
B004BTAJ2A|4|Looks and feels good.  however, the stitching is already becoming undone.  I just bought this less than a month ago.  I am going to try to repair it myself.  Glue maybe..
B00K6B1JOY|5|Did exactly what it stated it would do.. Plug and play. No more hyper blinking. Arrived way before del date stated... Very happy..
B00NGHLY4U|4|Very nice.
B003TTL0TE|5|I just received my chemical guys chenille microfiber mitt today... Thanks
B010RDEKE6|5|Terrific product for constant monitoring of pressure and temperature for your off road vehicle. We have it on all the bikes, atvs and side by sides that we own. They have worked perfectly and provide essential information for peak performance.
B00498UQ26|3|Fits 07 Elantra just fine. Didn't stop the clunking sound I'm hearing in the rear and feels about the same as the ones with 100k. Good cheap replacement.
B0062BHOOG|1|Works great until you need to change the batteries. Then you find out that inside the case this is a piece of junk. The batteries are not the type most people have lying around the house - so you'll have probably have to buy them specially for this device. Even though I had used the gauge fairly regularly, when I opened it up, the batteries were corroded and the battery holder broke when I tried to get them out. The batteries are wedged into the holder way too tightly; they could have used a different battery type and a better holder, but they cheaped out. Now I have a worthless device.
B002P33KVQ|5|Highly recommend. Bought this for a UV Water purification system and its worked great. Wiring was simple and its not terribly loud.
B008W1NXTY|3|Snow far, snow good.  So I can't truly and fully eval these as of yet as I've not put them thru snow and rain.  To date they've held up fine with minimal usage.  Seem thick and sturdy so hope they stay the course of the truck's life!
B0043AV4NK|5|I am very please with this purchase. It sounds very deep compared to other cars around town. I received many compliments on my exhaust.
B00HS8X53Q|5|great fit, nice looking mirrors
B010EYQ60E|5|Now we wait to see if he wins
B00JKSSXFM|5|Great Quality!
B000EFXJJA|3|It's a Haynes Manual with their typical BREIF descriptions.
B00473VPFK|5|They fit just right and very happy with my order.
B009IFIB0Y|5|Perfect fit. 2003 Chevy suburban.
B007TY69TG|5|When I finally ordered the right part it is working great. Of course the polarity is reversed but that is minor problem.
B000EQR87S|5|After turning my gas cap the wrong way (cuz Imma derp like that) and wrenching it into place semi-permanently I replaced it with this cap.  I am so much happier with this cap, a quick quarter turn loosens it, a quick quarter turn tightens it.  I sometimes have to double check that it's actually on there.
B0046NUOLM|5|This is the steering kit for the guys that are sick and tired of wandering steering , irregular tire wear. Etc on a 2003-2007 dodge... Just don't forget to order new nylock nuts
B00GSAUHB8|4|Adds sun protection u/v - otherwise not much difference in temperature inside of the car.
B001AVE79S|4|works great
B00SW0LMPW|5|they look awesome
B007W2GJCC|5|I installed this on my tractor and connected it to LED marker lights installed high on both sides on my ROPS and also to the yellow turn signal lights. I did not use strobe LED's, but this device powers the LED marker lights perfectly, and it is fun switching through the different modes.
B008RU3FRA|1|Unit did not work as soon as I plugged it in it started smoking and got hot never did my go cart 150cc engine ever start
B00BG8P8PM|4|Quality product. No issues.
B000CM5CA4|1|i'm sure it would of been fine if it fit my car. I chose this because it had &#34;sure fitting&#34; I put my car make and model in and it said i was good to go. The problem when i received it was that I have a 97 Mercury Cougar XR7. Adding the XR7 was not an option when i put in the info. Oh well it was only 14 bucks.
B00CHQV7CU|5|Love this my car looks so cute and it goes on easy with no problems
B00KTHYG9A|3|NICE PRODUCT BUT DIDN,T FILL MY EXPECTATIVES.
B0052QNJZU|5|Exactly what I was looking for
B00KL3ALGO|5|Easy to shape, stick, remove & re-stick
B000A09MCW|5|Great Price
B00O9Y5WQK|1|in the package had only 6 units and 20 units as no anucio says !!! send me the missing
B00AXH8NQS|5|Perfect
B000CNL9X2|2|HALF THE ITEMS WERE WRONG . I OREDERED 2 WELD ON TIPS AND I GOT 1 WELD ON AND 1 CLAMP ON.
B00HEZQI3M|5|works good
B000KZ0Q7W|4|Works ok does not have a very long range but is acceptable... Later when using the buttons prints fade away but by then you probably will know what's what
B000LN1776|5|Used for a 1958 Evinride Fastwin 18hp. The spring comes wound secured with two zip ties and a metal band that runs around the spring. It's coiled a bit too wide to directly drop into the casing. Grip the spring well directly below the interior loop and cut off the ties and remove the metal security ring. Then, you can pull to outer ring end to tighten the spring up a bit and wind it back a little over itself. I had no trouble doing this but be warned the spring is under a lot of tension and it can be tragic scene if you allow it to unwind on you.
B005EVARDU|1|sucked
B00516T0NQ|5|Fits like a glove very well made.
B0010GG7YG|5|the right part
B009HNF8Y4|5|i love it...as expected
B00R244CJM|1|I found yellow plasti dip a bit hard to come by, so i figured i would try this and compare.  Big mistake.  The coverage is horrible,  and it drips terribly.  I was able to cover the exact same piece with plasti dip with no problem.  After 5 coats,  i figured it would be faster and easier to order a different product that works.
B0037WB6ZQ|5|Excellent
B005LXTOEY|5|Everything I was expecting.
B00513G82U|4|After I fought with getting the backrest on I had no more problems with it
B000EQB6K8|1|The product looks fine, but Amazon inaccurately lists that this fits a Mitsubishi Eclipse 2000. It does not.
B00KMYYQ5O|4|Easy to use
B000BYELQY|1|Did not fit my 2014 VW Jetta. Seems to be an issue that some VW owners are experiencing, and now I can add my name to the list. The sizing is correct, but the bracket doesn't fit the mount properly.
B000EVYGZA|5|This is a great multimeter for the money.
B002OCFJ9O|5|This switch works just as well as the factory part at a MUCH cheaper cost. Our switch has went out 3 times now, the first two replacements we bought at over 70.00 from the dealer and both went out in less than a year!! I ordered this one because it was a lot cheaper, and it has worked flawlessly for a long time now. At this cost even if it does quit in the next year or two I can afford to buy another. The seller was great to work with me to ensure I had the right part as well. I couldn't be happier with the quality of this switch!
B00E5KMZFE|5|So cute, and awesome. Exactly what I was looking for!
B000NWA75I|5|This was a GM part in GM packaging at less than 1/2 the cost from a dealership.
B002R1CCBK|5|Perfect!
B00BY0H2UG|5|These are my go to gloves.  THEY ARE AWESOME AND DURABLE
B005PWUVI4|3|this was the second battery I bought. Had to adapt for this one because the terminals were larger than the last one.
B0096A4LTG|4|I took a chance on fuel pump assembly being an exact fit, it was.  very happy!!!  Price wasn't outrageous like the<br />other ones.
B009NOZ5C2|5|a great yellowish white colour and very bright.
B002ZBWKAU|2|mine does not register pressure and continues to pump, also the light sucks. It's hardly bright.
B004LFABDQ|4|Leg works great. Smooth operation.  Had to come back and buy the drive gear as the one from old landing gear did not fit right. New drive gear slipped right on.
B006JDDWAM|4|The item arrived earlier than expected. Easy to put on. Except the mirror has an adjustable gauge inside that sticks out therefore unable to put the cover on in the inside of door, leaving it exposed. But for this price, it is a great deal.
B001C99388|5|Order arrived on time. Parts were an exact replacement. A slide puller is the best way to remove the hub from the axle. I also used penetrating oil, to assist in removal. On reassembly, i used a lot of  anti - seize! The project took about 3 hours. Thank-You Amazon, this order saved me about 100 bucks. Doing the job myself saved me nearly a thousand bucks.
B0002Q81WG|5|Good product
B003PI2BFG|3|Good: Sturdy built hitch who's load capacity exceeds that of the Jetta it is mounted to.<br />Installation was straight forward (if you've done this sort of thing before), just follow the single sheet instruction set - if you understand IKEA you can follow this one.<br /><br />Not so good: A hang up was the spare tire well washer, it is a round washer for a tear drop shaped depression. Installing it as-is would have crushed the single layer sheet metal walls. Rounding the edges of the washer with a hand held grinder created a much better fit.<br />The Jetta already has low ground clearance, this hitch hangs low and extends backward such that it further reduces the angle of attack. Now we scrape in most driveways, some speed bumps, and forget about going over a curb.<br />Its a shame - with minimal re-engineering this would be a great hitch.
B00B30RGT4|3|Thought it was engraved but it's just a sticker
B00B7LYICC|5|Beautiful fits perfect even feels like great quality
B008IEFA0U|5|These are great to have as they can get lost. These will last a long time. I love the way that they are made. A great buy!
B0107UG5O2|5|Great illumination, perfect fit.
B009TB66OA|2|Didn't fit my vehicle as advertised and had to pay shipping to send it back
B000GZHPIO|5|Sorry this review is alittle long. But i hope it helps.  I have a 1996 Kawi vn2000 and went with these newer length pipes. About 6 inches longer than the shorts. Really nice sound not loud at cruising speed, sounds really good at idle. BUT if you want to warn Harley riders that you have serious horsepower just rip the throttle and they roar !!.install was easy DON'T GET IN A HURRY !!  .Make sure to check the nuts and bolts after 500 miles. I have about 2000 miles on mine with no prob. Don't get crazy when you tighten the exhaust nuts..AND GET THE FUEL INJECTION MODULE !!.I went with the Cobra It makes a big differance . ALSO get the oxygen sensor adapter from DYNOJET. ( must have items ). They look and function sweeeeet. Good luck...
B004VDT2FQ|5|Very good product easy to install
B007GME2LI|5|Keeps wind off my knees
B00C315NEW|4|Looks great on my 2014 BRZ! 4-stars as the fit isn't quite as good as OEM.
B00K87VWQQ|5|exactly what I needed.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Wow! We LOVE this light! It lights-up our entire front yard! So glad we ordered it!
B00TPZ9JZ8|2|the item it burn
B009FREAGO|5|This is exactly how it's pictured. I like it much better than the trash can that sit on the floorboards. I'm going to buy a second one once we get another vehicle.
B0040CTVAE|3|my fault, got the wrong type...
B00EVRXW5I|5|Good quality boot.
B00A82JB3W|5|They were just what I wanted, easy installation, very very bright
B000GU7I72|5|We use it. Do you?
B009V191WW|5|I'll give it 5 stars because it fits and considering the geometry that's impressive.  This is a direct fit for the Nissan Murano, I needed to replace the front pipe/converter due to corrosion from road salt. The most difficult part of any exhaust job is getting the old parts out without breaking studs or rounding off nuts.  The pros have welding gear handy to help remove corroded parts.  As an amateur mechanic I don't have acetylene but I do have a trick up my sleeve.  MAPP gas. This product is readily available from Amazon and at hardware stores and home centers.  It will greatly assist you in removing badly corroded bolts and nuts.  Simply heat until red hot and break the fastener free using hand tools but an impact socket.  The heavier socket can take the hot temperature without failing  Use common sense and be careful. In my case I was able to remove 12 year old corroded fasteners (10 of them) without any breakage of any kind and was able to reuse the OE studs. This pipe/converter fit perfectly and I'm confident it will last for the remaining life of this Murano.  Removal of the old parts took an afternoon as I work carefully.  Installation of this pipe/converter took less than an hour.  Our old 2003 Murano is so quiet.  Just like new and at a fraction of dealer cost.
B005FUX2WI|4|Awesome. Nice and bright. Just not sure why you get 9. I only have 7 locations for 194 bulbs in my '12 g37x
B001N4QY66|4|The UI could use some work but it works fine
B0126YHPQY|5|[[VIDEOID:e6b275337aa304169a1fc70338e1e137]] I have done a full LED conversion on the inside of my Tahoe and started on the outside. I did a little research on the reverse lights and noted that the 3157 bulbs were pretty big when it comes to LED's. So I took the jump and installed this KDL Highlight LED 3157-18 set. I have provided a video review and I encourage you to watch it to see the difference in the standard incandescent 3157 bulb and the new LED bulb. I like the pure white light that LEDs offer and this is what I used on the inside. All pure white 6000k bulbs. The bulbs are about a 1/4 to 1/2 longer than standard bulbs so bare that in mind. Make sure you have ample distance between the end of the bulb and your bulb cover/lens.  These bulbs do not list the K value but they are right at 5000K - 6000K pure white. I don't really see any hint of blue in them that the 6000K gives off so I am guessing they are 5000K..thats a guess. They are noticeably different from the standard brownish yellow standard bulbs..I love them. The pure white light makes it easier for me to see backing out of my long driveway. The throw light about 10 feet farther than the standard bulb did too. There was no flickering issues that I have had with other bulbs either. For the price these are spot on. These cost upwards of 20 bucks at my local parts store. These would be great in just about any 3157 location on your vehicle. I am getting 2 more sets to replace my blinkers and tail lights.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br />I received a sample product to test and evaluate. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review.
B00M468ZSC|5|Love this little bag! Great for the price!
B0096EN878|5|Excellent product, it works perfectly.
B00332GOEI|1|I had these about a month and a half before they broke and caused the windows on my 2007 honda accord sedan to jam. Thankfully my car has built in saftey features that do not allow the windows to close all the way if there was an obstruction. If it did not have this my windows would be off track and I would have to bring my car in for repair. I would not recommend going cheap on these items as I did. I would suggest that if you want this type of item go with a better quality product like weather tech.
B00XQMYTGU|5|Like them a lot the shipping was really fast and the lights plugged in and work Thanks.
B00JF5LRN0|4|The 18153 model basket is everything I've come to expect from Curt.  All the parts are heavy-duty, the finish is excellent, the assembly was relatively simple and the product quality is great.<br /><br />Assembly note:  When putting the unit together, be sure to only loose-fit the three large bolts through the two halves of the basket and the main shaft.  If you tighten these too far, initially, it will be exceptionally difficult to get the 8 bolts, that hold the two halves together with steel plates, lined up properly.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Basket is very heavy, and likely will not flex much under load.<br />- Tough finish should hold up to a fair amount of abuse.<br />- The angled-up shank really helps in my situation; the Chrysler Town and Country's hitch mount is only 5 inches off the ground.<br />- The ability to fold this unit up, closer to the car, makes parking in crowded areas much easier.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Basket is very heavy.  It can be difficult to get mounted into the receiver.  It can be done as a one-person project, but is easier with two.  If mounting solo, have the basket folded up until it is in the receiver, then fold it down to align the hitch-pin.<br />- When folded up, the basket does wobble a fair amount and is noisy on rough surfaces.<br />- To achieve the folding capability, the shank is a fair amount longer.  This places the basket quite far behind the vehicle when laying flat.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this basket.  I believe it will provide years of good service.
B000C5GAZW|5|Installed cap on coolant expansion tank in 2002 Jetta station wagon with 190,000 miles.  Cap and tank functioning properly.
B00N3ORZKS|3|I received this faring kit 8 days ahead of the earliest I was supposed to get it. Everything out of the package was nice, no scuffs or scrapes. Heavy duty plastic overall. I was impressed with the product. I did think that there was going to be the plastic that mounts onto the gas tank to cover the air box hole but there wasn't those plastic pieces, that is part of the reason I ordered this, I mean spending this amount of money on plastic and it doesn't have a pieces that you wanted it to have when you could have gotten others that do. That's the only reason I gave it 3 stars
B00GRNAXTM|5|Perfect color match and great product. If you take your time and do it right then it can really fix a small scratch and make it unnoticeable.
B00NB5ESK4|5|Perfect. Thank you!
B000IYHFGU|4|Exactly what I needed but only really needed the connector.  This connector is also used on the speed sensor of 2002 Ford Explorer 5R55W transmission.  I had damaged mine when I removed the transmission for rebuild.  Could have gotten one from a salvage yard but my time is valuable and saw it here on Amazon which was really convenient.
B004FG1D6U|5|My son loves the flower in my cute car!
B0002SQZRC|4|great gloss! Doesn't last very long.
B000UUMM6K|5|the best
B00480BWCI|3|don't last break too easily.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Excellent product and customer service!!  Love the window cling versus other products I have used with suction cups that wouldn't stay on the window.
B00CPGGZNS|5|Item was as described. It is great .I would recommend
B00ABZCETY|4|Good price for a good product, love them on my riding vest.....
B0009H529I|4|Good price..
B00ODN57BW|5|This is a very heavy duty wheel chock, not a wimpy plastic thing, but very solid with a metal frame holding it together.  I purchased several other chocks before finding this one, and this one is the real deal, up to the task of holding my RV when I park it on the hill in front of my house.
B004MXGXIY|5|Easy installation with everything included
B00AM7GYR4|5|I have a vw where the cup holder when used blocks the radio- this works very well
B0062IJP32|5|Looks great
B001SG4JXO|5|It fit very well. no issues at all.<br />But be careful, if have a v6 with dual exhaust, you will need to lower them, and that is harder to actually do it. I had to jack the car up to insert this receiver. And after, you will find it hard to tightening the bolts cause the exhaust is in the way.
B001PWA0IO|4|Great product, bad directions.
B0009H5202|5|I purchased this filter for my 2005 Hyundai Accent GLS. Fit like a glove and has been effective.  No complaints.
B00BV6EZB2|5|Very nice quality product. Glad I opted for this one instead of other kinds I saw on here. Seems like it was better made then the stock one. Drives much better now. Thanks!
B009E2VU4K|5|I fixed my RV toilet and it has not leaked since.
B00FESA9G8|5|This is exactly what I needed. I tried the crappy &#34;clear ones&#34; and they don't fit, look bad, and are really hard to remove. Hit these with a hair dryer for 30 seconds and stick it on. easy peezy.<br /><br />I didn't want to risk matching a color to my cars so that's why I went with the carbon. I looks good on my red car and pearl SUV.
B00E0GOX9E|1|Not the same size as oem. I could also tell by design that the oem style does filter better. I would not recommend this product for third gen Prius.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|We have used it a couple of times at the beach. Much better than a towel or blanket. All you have to do is brush the sand off or wipe it down. It does absorb the heat a little from the sun/ sand, but we sit on our towels. We have no complaints.
B00TVKBS88|5|Excellent quality product
B003H13QQE|1|did not work. Could not get in programmed and I to pay 150 for a new one at the dealers
B001PRX7WK|5|No problems, easy to install and durable.
B0013REXO8|4|Great fit but I wouldn't count on these for protection just for looks.
B00T4Y62IC|1|The the scent ring leaked everywhere and the clips broke within a couple of days of use.  Avoid and get the air freshener and vent clip separate.
B0016ZUOKE|4|These fit great!  I have a little challenge snapping them but other than that I love them!
B004NFXA7I|5|Arrived fast and this is an incredible product.
B005Q4QTAK|2|Luckily we only needed one because one of them broke during shippment... 😕
B007MD9J32|5|Look great! Everything they claim to be.
B004UL7Z9E|5|looks great and seems to be great quality
B00L3E0LQU|2|It fits but the loops keep coming off..
B005G50QWQ|5|It's great
B00D1YP8FE|5|THEY WERE EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED  ,INSTALLED EASY AND WORK GREAT. GREAT VALUE!
B0016ILPFE|5|great item A++++
B005FKR12K|5|GREAT PRODUCT!! PACKED GREAT & CAME QUICK. WILL BUY AGAIN.
B006R34PB4|2|only one light worked. not worth the hassle to replace.
B000C7UR5O|5|It's working great for 3 weeks
B00BR9YJ0U|5|Awesome
B005OVDBUG|5|Exact replacement could not have been any more pleased!
B007V2DSIG|4|Fit OK, insulation great
B0023078PA|5|Fit perfect on my 2015 FLHTK
B00WTUB314|1|It broke the first time I needed it for backing a trailer.
B002KBCYE2|4|this was a gift and the person loved it!
B00AYXM4DY|5|Worked well...covered all black plastic areas on my 2006 Toyota Tundra.  Remains on the plastic after several car washes and 100 degree heat.
B00PUWJ9EG|2|cheap quality.
B001NOJ6N4|4|WORKS PERFECT FOR KEEPING HANDS OUT OF COLD
B004WF75B6|5|Great glasses, always buy them
B000MCXOR2|5|Awesome size is big enough to catch all the fluid leaks from my 266,000 mile work truck.
B00MNRXINO|5|Yes verry Good is it , i love...
B001U6DMSK|4|Oh, yes perfectly cover , and looks very nice,...I love it.
B003FID1NW|1|Would not program to my car computer to use!
B008OXJIGW|4|tools are pretty well made.  The case is padded and perfect size to fit under seat.  The kit should contain an adjustable wrench.
B00Q88P6UC|5|PERFECT APPLICATION FOR RANGER CREW 900
B0083G3AXC|4|Very handy but you have to remove to store the chair. Small price to pay for the usage you will get out of it!
B002SB00QS|5|Absolutely must have MOD for your Toyota Tundra. Very easy install. I have never done anything other than change the oil in my vehicles and I was done in about an hour. Would have been done quicker if I had it on a lift but the clearance under the Tundra gives you plenty of room.<br /><br />Performance wise I could immediately tell the difference when take off ramps and turns with any speed. You immediately lose that body roll feeling you had without it. As for hauling it seems to help with the weight distribution a bit. I have a 6000 lb camper with a equalizing hitch so I really didn't feel much difference than without.<br /><br />I think the primary function of this is to eliminate the body roll anyways. Again this is a must have for Tundra owners. Inexpensive and easy MOD.
B000BN3A4Y|5|It's difficult to review tools like these. I've never had to use it in an emergency, so not sure how it performs.
B0009HOWYO|5|easy install, easy removal - looks good on my truck
B008SEBQ2G|5|No reception but I use sat radio or streaming from my phone. Great for looks and the carwash.
B005JU5XYE|5|The Bosch ICON blades are the best. They are easy to install and do a great job at wiping my windshield. That's all I asked for and they do their job.
B00LBAC12S|4|keeps the sun out and even a light rain.  it's very nice and easy to install
B005BNP7YU|3|Cheaply made
B00CKIHT1S|5|I used these lights to take the place of the OEM lights in my Kubota B8200DT with front end loader. They put out a great spread of bright light - just what is needed for a tractor. The brackets hold steady too, with no vibration even with the diesel engine running.
B000E8T80Q|3|after reading on bobistheoilguy.com that many of these filters have failed...I've switched to another brand.<br />I also save my old filters and cut them open to inspect for tearing and failure.<br /><br />I'll give it 3 stars...because I personally havent had a failure...but saw over 56 that did fail...sooo.....risky...
B00MS93F2G|5|AWESOME EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED FOR VW BEETLE
B00ECTQNF6|5|Nice and bright LED markers. I mounted mine on the ROPS of my tractor and hooked a strobe box to them. They work really well as strobe safety lights, although not quite as bright as purpose built LED strobes.
B009DJV56C|4|Fast delivery some instructions would have been nice
B0068OZ25K|1|This is a piece of s......!!! Fell apart n didn't  work..thru out -seller not helpful at all even phone number in packing slip NO GOOD!!!!!
B0001CMUV4|5|Hitch was moving around on the trail that was holding an offroad tire. this synched it up and it hasnt moved. Been on there for almost 6 mos and no issues.
B00H2484WI|5|This is for my Cummins 400 ISL. Note that this is the water seperator one with the sensor connection on the bottom.
B005HJMX4U|4|Magnet is not as strong as I would like it to be, but its holding so...no complaints
B003UXUGX0|4|This is a huge bag!  This is not like the cheap duffle bags at the department store.  The sections are vented to prevent bacteria and smells the material is a good quality including the zippers.  Lots of room in the main compartment and several external pouches for accessories.  As long as you are ready for huge it is a great bag!  I am glad I bought it.
B00V30J86I|1|Extremely small, if you can even install it!  Very disappointed!
B0000AY2Z6|4|Works good on boat wish it was stronger breeze
B00FZFFR9Y|5|excellent product, filled my expectations
B0038B186I|1|Focus according to information does not serve corolla 2001. The works focus on the corolla 98-2000.
B000RI0GIG|5|I build custom cabinets. I'm constantly spraying paint and clear lacquer. The cup keeps constant fluid pressure in the gun. I couldn't imagine not having one now.
B007D5XXNG|5|Well made
B0031I201K|1|cheep
B00K8E0WAG|5|No problems whatsoever with this battery. Works great for my back up sump pump!
B000CIQ5DG|5|Works as it should.
B0050ZAFGO|4|Great kit.  This kit would be better with the rubber grommet to seal the headlamp.  This is the missing star in my case. For sure, not every application would need it because most of the car have the 3 terminal connector going to the bulb from outside the headlamp.  On my car, the wire come from inside the headlamps so wiring and the big 3 terminal connector need to go into the headlamp and a 1.25 inch hole need to be drilled in the headlamp bulb cover.  I ended up removing the rubber grommet from my fog lamp kit (it was not used), cut it in half and use it on this bi-xenon kit.  Also, I did use duct seal to make sure it was really waterproof.  I did buy the 5000K because I didn't want yellow, just white in my lights.  On the other hand, that do not bring the police attention like the 6000k which is more blue and tell everything about your customization...  barely legal.
B00NXRY5EY|5|Very impressed with the wipers so far bought for both cars- my wifes Lexus RX350 and my GS350 went on very easily without any problems. Good quality and even quieter now- time will tell as far as how long they last.
B00I95VIYK|5|Great price works good
B00JTACH4Y|5|I wasn't sure if these were Cool White, but they are. Cheap and they look great!
B00KTIYXLU|5|Works as described. Good price
B000EQVS6A|5|Fixed the boost problem on Chevy 6.5 turbo Diesel.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Excellent product! Don't expect your headlights to look brand new but this product makes a world of difference! FYI, once you think you are done with the first sanding stage- keep going. The more you do with the coarse sandpaper, the less the finishing pieces have to do.
B002WCXTRU|5|Fits nice
B004WMDXRE|5|The correct part came in a timely manner.
B000ZRW78Q|5|i love it...as expected
B00FMUZ15W|5|nice look.
B007BKEZ4O|2|Cheap plastic look&feel like. Dissapointed
B000E49616|5|i love it...as expected
B001DKM3SI|5|Just like advertised.  Made cleaning my car that much easier.  Thanks amazon!
B004RFQIKA|3|Doesnt get the mower deck up very high, and you cannot use it on the driveway or the mower just pushes it along.  I was able to use it on the grass, and was able to change the blades though.  For the money, I guess its worth it.
B000GOJW9K|4|worked fine, more quiet than the one it replaced.
B009F7UE0K|4|cant fit much with a helmet in it so its not very useful unless thats all you need to carry
B005BNZ1BE|5|Excellent product
B001NIGH4G|5|This sticker came in on time and it was much bigger than I was expecting (which I take as a good thing) although the colors were not as bright as in the picture given, I still can't wait to put it on my skateboard ! Great buy
B0000AY65X|4|Good for canoe restoration.  You will need 2 coats and a much more than 16.9 oz for an average motor boat.  Buy an inexpensive orbital buffer.
B003X87KHW|5|works great
B00UCO4DY8|1|Bad quality
B0002STSV2|5|Good quality plastic with strong magnets.
B0027Y0Q2O|5|Torque specs would be nice. i installed with a energy suspension sway bar bushing kit an all went well.
B008X2V2LS|5|Thx
B000C59YYQ|5|As part of all new suspension on my 10 year old Grand Caravan, these were a great deal on a great product.<br />I've used Moog components for 40 years as Moog = Quality.
B00L32KNV0|4|Metal rods try to pierce the cover when it's folded. When unfolding the rubber gasket ends roll up on themselves. Other then that it's a nice cover for the money.
B008971VOK|5|We ordered this liscence plate for my husbands tc. Arrived very quickly and its very sturdy and sleek. We definitely love how it made our car look. Thank you!
B000QFDCCC|2|is nice but I order the smoke one not the clear
B00UHD4HJA|5|the brands of stickers they mix for you is amazing. honestly they stick to both my board and laptop perfectly, they don't peel at all.
B00ANZHG4U|5|awesome buy all the time!
B012YMDPHG|5|I work in the mechanical field and have lots of experience with bigger name and bigger dollar scanners and this little guy performed great for what it needs to be used for.  I found it to be very accurate in what it reads perfect for a car owner not looking to spend big bucks on a scanner.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to make a diagnostic on their vehicle.  It also comes with an instruction and code book to help you along with making your repair.  The best part is that its very compact and can even fit in most glove compartments!
B00L1RUTVQ|1|These are not OEM for a 2004 Toyota Sequoia - had to return.
B00VFEI1NI|5|This is exactly what I needed after I lost my other keyring. It is slim, fits into my palm, detaches the two sets of keys that I use for different purposes, and it is actually quite elegant. I highly recommend it.
B00KTJ1PLU|5|Works great for the price
B000E0Z970|4|Exactly what I wanted. Perfect fit
B0013FW1OY|3|Works well. This would be a better product if the wires were colored like the original plug was.
B00NSIA9GQ|3|I'm not sure it will last a long time.  It functions properly now but is working itself loose and will need a screw retightening.  If it doesn't fall apart it gets the job done I needed it for at a very low price (I use it on my riding lawnmower so LOTS of turns).
B00IXZI7V8|4|These mats are nice, except they're black, not gray. I'm starting to wonder if the ones that came even belong in this box...the box says &#34;also available in cargo and second row liners...&#34; Why would it say that if this kit is supposed to come with the second row liners? If this is supposed to be &#34;gray&#34; then someone needs to post a new picture because it's not even close.  Updated: replacement mats came in and they were more in-line with the picture. I'd rate 5 starts except I almost broke my thumbs trying to get the holes to fit over the floor mat hooks. I finally quit because it looked like they might start cracking.
B00CUL4V2A|2|I have had this for about 2 months now.  I had to get it programed at a dealer for my 2011 ram 1500.  At first it has been working fine.  Over the last 2 weeks I have noticed my doors are unlocked on a regular basis, now my windows keep rolling down as well.  The unlock button on the fob has malfunctioned and keeps sticking.<br /><br />While the key works in the ing it is unless b/c as soon as I turn off the truck the doors open and windows roll down.
B009DJIPNS|5|Parts were shipped quickly and were well packaged. They look and feel solid, will install them and update the review if something isn't right but overall very happy with how little the whole kit cost!
B000VAKXVA|1|If you have police Eagle RS-A Plus/Pursuit P225/60R16 forget about it! They wont fit!!! I bought them in the summer and threw them in the trunk thinking I'm ready for the winter, yeah right snow came I'm stuck trying to get up a hill and was impossible to fit. 1999 Ford Crown Victoria P71.
B002D4SWJM|3|This was good little thin
B00CAKILAO|3|Received the mats pretty quickly.  The quality seems okay for this price range, but not as good as the Acura all-weather mats. The biggest issue is that the two front seat mats are way too narrow for an Acura RDX (2015 model) even though the description said it would fit that model.  So we feel like we have to keep the original fabric mats in place, but it looks a bit strange to have both mats there.  And the sides of the floor/fabric mats will get dirty.  The back seat mat fits pretty well - just a little to big, but can be cut smaller.  It's too much hassle to return them, so I guess we'll just make do.
B00T1R7EKW|5|Love the fit and price, but I was not able to install. I messed it up. One problem is that I installed channel visor and it pinches the window really tight. When I started to roll up the window while it was still wet it forced it off. I had to roll up the window to get the bottom tint on. From there everything went wrong. I plan on either getting it professionally done or reordering this same kit when I switch from manual to power windows and can remove the whole glass. Highly suggest having someone help you that has done this before. It looks easy watching others do it in videos, it's another story doing it yourself for the first time.
B00YI2UTSE|5|I had a standard sun shade that didn't quite fit and wouldn't stay in place with the sun visors in the car.  This one fits perfectly and covers the entire windshield.
B00AMMCKB8|4|The mats fit my 2014 malibu great. They look good for the price.
B0054SN5AA|5|Perfect fit on my 2008 sentra
B0052YDXRQ|5|I like it
B000CPJLVC|5|Very bright red, looks great!
B00RF95TDC|5|Love this telescoping lug wrench. The leverage the extended handle gives you makes it simple to pop off lug nuts that otherwise would be very difficult. Well made at an exceptional price.
B004YJTM5M|5|Great on my fj
B00HL1X288|4|Decent quality at a bargain price.
B001RLZ7L8|5|Installed on 2.0 liter engine in 2002 Jetta station wagon with 190,000 miles.  Engine functioning properly.
B001551K3U|5|Love this license plate cover! It looks great on my Prius!
B00SMJ7NYC|2|Fits my 2000 zx6r, however it is not black like the photos.  It has the generic ZXR, exactly like the others you see, printed on the cap.  It is not plain black.  I chose this because of the photo.  However, the photo is not representative of the product.<br /><br />2 stars up from one because it functions.  The cap doesn't like to thread back into it's housing.  Usually takes a couple tries to get started.
B002P8SXLI|5|Fit perfectly on my '05 Toyota Corolla. Fast shipping as well!Thanks!
B00YI78WW4|2|Looks ok but was a pain to put on, front seat has these Velcro that are very hard to put under the seat and the back seat covers don't fit right. Plus there's no holes for the headrest so that don't hit well, they give these little hooks to hold top and bottom but are very difficult to put on as well as tacky. Would never have bought this if I know it would be like this
B005982W7M|5|Great jacket to start with.  Has good ventilation while riding and not hot in the summer as your first thoughts would be when holding it in your hands. This jacket seems to be of very good quality compared to my s&s mesh jacket. The padding feels like it was actually molded for a human to start with. The leather is also made of a very good quality. My opinion is its definitely worth the money and I feel much safer wearing this jacket. Not to mention people look at you like you transform into a superhero when you put it on lol.
B008OJ5RPW|5|Genuine part, disnt install it yet but i will update the review when i do..  I really wish this fixes my problem.
B00KZJQ2L2|4|The only one I found that fits our Dodge Promaster window - I added little Velcro dots to hold up the far edges and it covers quite nicely.
B00809XEEC|5|Worked good for a 2008 dodge charger 2.7l v6.
B00BITJZUI|4|Worked great
B00FODHWAO|5|This light is exactly what I was looking for. It is completely waterproof and it's a bright light. Several of the flash patterns are virtually useless in my opinion, but there a few good patterns that get attention. My light has been through a few good storms and I've never had problem. This is the best magnetic light one will find without spending a lot more money. Finally, it has a guarantee! I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.
B000P6WQB0|5|Good price.  Works.
B000SL0R9K|5|excellent. exactly as described.
B000BQWLE6|5|So before I ordered this I didn't check the measurements and I didn't know that this was for a car.  It is tiny.  As it turns out I needed one for my car as well so kept this and the ordered a larger one for what I needed it for.  It's perfect for your car though! Even has a little Velcro piece to hold it to the floor.
B006JDDWAM|5|These door handles are not super durable, however they are as durable as the original. They fit perfect and install easy.
B0081S997I|5|worked great
B004JB7CFC|3|I can't speak to longevity, as I installed this only a few months ago, but it seems like a high quality unit and was a correct fit for my 2002 Forester.  Edit:  After only a few thousand miles one of the inner tie rod ends is starting to loosen a bit.  Back to OEM suspension parts for me.
B00AVA2DJA|5|Best fuel jug I ever bought, thank you
B00FR2JF0W|4|Not waterproof, but easily installed and worked fine. On time delivery.
B0051PJWQW|5|Most DIY kits do not come with a sealer...so you have to buy another DIY kit in a year or less! This sealer prevents that. You can't go wrong with it! I cleaned my headlights with the 3M kit, used this per some other helpful reviews, and everything is looking great, years later. Thanks Blue Magic!
B00G2Q78MO|5|excellent product and customer service.. the only thing i dont like is having to pay shipping to return the core and validate the warranty Great Price..
B00KTHYDA2|5|Exactly as described. Still using both of them for about 8 months now. Easy to program by yourself. Just search on google. A few simple steps and your remote will be working perfectly. Will buy again if needed.
B0051TPJKG|5|Hopefully I'll never need them.
B006WQSKI0|5|Excellent product
B001EGT3I4|5|Best quality replacement. Superb fit and finish. Highly recommend.
B00QFY2BCK|5|WOW.. I am impressed with this product.. brought my foggy headlights back to just about new on my 2007 Nissan Altima.
B00EKTIDZQ|5|Make your car looks poppin
B002MQ6NP6|5|Fits great!
B00B9DZKDE|5|good deal! quick delivery!  A++++++
B00ACP02ZQ|5|Nice
B00UADG1WI|5|Coils fit perfect and work great, i also replaced the spark plugs. This fixed the engine misfire code. Engine runs great once again.
B005I5I554|5|These are nice made gloves, worth the money.  Daughter loves them and her new helmet.
B00BKV6D7C|5|i looked at many wind screens and finally just decide to order this one. I figured for the price I would try this one. Way above and beyond my expectations. It came 6 days before the estimated delivery. Ordered on a Friday and got Monday. It fits perfectly with no misaligned holes. It fits better than a $100 dollar shield I tried. It's same quality as the factory as far as I can tell. Not flimsy or cheap feeling. It looks awesome on the bike and no more high speed wind buffeting. Great product awesome price. Don't hesitate to buy.
B00GB8SXAO|4|I just got the remote start installed.  The only thing that I wasn't satisfied with is that after using the remote start to start my truck, my truck cuts off when I step on the brake pedal.  I've had remote-start equipped vehicles before and I've been able to step on the brake, turn the key in the ignition (or push the push-to-start button) and the vehicle powers completely on without turning off first.
B006O85Q6A|5|Good fit
B00EHLACUQ|5|OE styled. Still Sporty!
B00651CLCS|1|Awesome if you don't want to listen to AM/FM radio. Reception is horrible.
B00I3RL1A0|5|This set is FANTASTIC!!<br /><br />Pros: Economically priced for even the DIYer who has a relatively small tools budget. Simple to use, even for guys who don't have much technical experience and are learning how to do a brake job by watching videos on YouTube. Works exactly as it should, winding back the piston into the caliber with ease in a matter of seconds! Compared to using a C-clamp like I always have, this tool saves so much time and frustration!<br /><br />Cons: Rusts fairly easy, be sure to apply some oil if you're going to store this in an unconditioned space.
B001NYFOOO|5|fit my volvo 2001
B0084UJHJI|5|Why on earth do car manufacturers make vehicles without mudflaps, I have no idea. However, with a set like this, the problem is very easily remedied!<br /><br />These flaps were incredibly easy to install, and have remained solidly in place for several months through all kinds of weather, and remain looking new after being subjected to much abuse!<br /><br />If you're not going to add many extras to your truck, but want to improve its appearance and protect it from being subjected to a constant onslaught of road debris winding up in your fenders, this is a great investment!
B008VLVDII|5|Just got an Acura MDX and wanted to protect the rear seats from my 7 year old.  They cover 99 percent of the seat. The material is thick and waterproof although a bit on the rough side. I did some modifications. I secured the top elastic straps with some string to attachment points on the seatbacks . This keeps the top from coming down when entering or leaving the vehicle. I also put a length of paracord across the seat where the back meets the bottom and secured it with a bungee cord in the back of the seat. This keeps the bottom in place and everything smooth and unwrinkled.
B00X5CR6ZM|5|Fast shipping. Item order exactly as expected.
B006LW9N9U|5|What a nice hardcover book! I'm so glad I have it. Very well done and feel comfortable now working on my motorcycle. Highly recommend for anybody that has a motorcycle to get their product
B0090B7M2O|5|Works as designed - has saved many trips to the shop already
B00KJ7U1A8|4|Decal was nice but a little  pricey. Can buy in stores for same amount.
B003RA8PEI|1|Still not conectet becouse i can not find that part on the cart. So for me totall it not work!!
B00EVYBXZM|4|Great for the price. Went in knowing I wasn't buying a top of the line set of bags, and received a product that slightly exceeded my expectations.took a little bit of Jimmy rigging to apply, but they don't feel like they are going to fall off.
B003ZZK304|4|Good quality.  Exactly what I expected.
B002UBZKUC|5|As advertised
B009PJIV0I|5|Fit my 1991 miata like a glove
B003UM7B98|5|excellent
B00265FXTA|5|works great, saved a bunch compared to &#62;$200 from dealer
B00598SKHI|3|ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SUCTION CUPS KEEP POPPING OUT OF THE SHADE.
B00FFDPPCA|5|Worked perfectly.
B005NLQAHS|5|This is okay, but they really need to supply a solid android app with the device. There were lots of apps, but it took 4 before I found one that actually worked enough to pull the codes from the car and it was still very buggy.  I'm updating my review, changing from 3 to 5 star. I have since found some &#34;pay&#34; apps that uncovered the full capabilities of this device. The device is solid, I've used it on a newer Mercedes and Volkswagon CC. You will need to use a highly rated pay app if you want to access all the features for your vehicle.
B004ISLNRE|5|This is a great tool for those hard-to-reach fasteners, especially if you have a few of Wera's speciality bits.
B00ZFADA2A|4|The dim side of one of the bulbs arrived DOA.  Case is sturdy, uses standard bulbs.  Good quality.  Bulb, case and lens are water resistant, nice o-ring seal on the front.  The two screw hole to remove the bulb are a little loose, it does not tighten firmly.  The case is good and solid however, so I will probably drill and tap it for a bit larger screws.  Overall, very good product.
B00AL1KK9Y|4|I really do like the tent, but it is a pain in a half to fold and put away. Probably more operator error than anything. But overall the tent is really nice and you can beat the price.
B00BMJF1VG|5|Xlnt. As described.
B00U9YVPO2|4|NICE PRODUCT, FIT VERY WELL ON MITSUBISHI MONTERO SPORT 2002. I RECOMEND IT
B00OC90BR2|1|I would not recommend this product. Within the first week of having it on I had over 5 studs missing which makes it look tacky.
B00514BT6Y|5|perfect for what I needed it for
B009QAI1OM|5|Well made and looks great!
B00TY78HD2|5|I have my order thank you
B004A2BBOI|5|awesome products for the right price.
B00ODGCWDU|5|Love it
B00O1QUUKY|5|Meets  expectations
B001OZS74G|5|Fits well. Uses silicone and one bolt to secure but feels very secure. Paint color is red but fixed with a can of black spray paint.
B00C9V1RJG|4|Not very rugged but very price friendly! Gives great lateral vision but objects appear pretty far back compared to my OEM mirror. All in all pretty good!
B004TCSWMI|5|Fan assy works great at a reasonable price
B000XB25HC|5|Easy replacement for my Sears Craftsman electric start mower!
B001F0IE7A|4|Very well built product! Love the heavy duty hardware that comes with the hinge. After installing it, it does have a little bit of a sag, but that was expected due to the 32&#34; I have between the hinge and the trailer tongue.
B00M9OMQJ8|3|Instructions could be better
B005JU5VUK|5|The Bosch ICON blades are the best. They are easy to install and do a great job at wiping my windshield. That's all I asked for and they do their job.
B00ASY23HQ|5|This was one of the easiest modifications to a Pilot that you could ever do. I was a bit disappointed that there was not a trailer kit already installed, since I have the towing package, but for the price this made way more sense than having it installed by the dealer. The hardest part was getting the self-tapping screws to work without stripping them. Definitely take the time to drill some pilot holes (no pun intended) and the screws will go in without a problem. All in all it took about 30 minutes to finish the install. It was nice and clean and I feel like it is just as good as some of the Honda installed kits.
B00295GHOC|4|ok
B00684MXL6|5|Product was an exact fit & arrived quickly. Thank you!
B00KS3ZDG0|3|These are very high quality & stylish riding pants, and the removable knee protection is top-notch. I'm very impressed by the quality, especially considering similar riding jeans for women can cost over $100 or $200 USD while these cost just ~$60 USD before shipping. My lower rating is entirely due the fit. In absence of having a sizing guide with measurements, I ordered a size 30 in these pants given that I currently wear a size 30 in Dainese women's riding pants. Unfortunately, these pants are far too small for me! For example, my size 30 Dainese pants have a hip circumference of 40&#34; but these size 30 pants have a 36&#34; hip circumference; the size 30 Dainese pants have a waist circumference of 33&#34; but these size 30 pants have a 29&#34; waist circumference. The product description mentions &#34;Product shipped from Italy. Please Read the condition of returns or size change.&#34; but there's no sizing information or return information available on the product page. I hope to be able to return these for a refund.
B000E0E6GK|5|Received on time, fits perfect. I will order again for next truck.
B00JBJ3K3U|5|Great replacement headlights. Screw paying 25-30 bucks for a headlight restoration kit and just order these and make that tired front end look brand new
B009Y7MJVS|4|Not yet road tested on my motorcycle
B000J4645M|3|Vibrates
B004O7DBM4|5|The light is perfect but resent the fact that I had to buy the Amber Lens Kit. I would think that 90% of the time this is purchased to replace the porch light on an RV of some sort. And 98% of them have an amber lens. Just another way to upsell the customer. Does anyone want to buy a clear lens for a Starlights SL-1000?
B00VLTUVVM|1|Just received these and they fit perfectly.  My issue with them is that they DO NOT come with the brackets for spot lights as shown in the advertisement and listed in the description.  I still plan on using them because they fit well and look very nice.  Just don't believe what you see in the pictures or read in the posting.
B006ZLDDWU|5|Exactly what it looks like. Well made and holds both valve covers and 8mm wires securely. I'll buy this for my next project too.
B011SPPXQQ|5|This item is so fancy and has a nice fragrance. easy to use, and so effective even in my office.<br />Strongly recommending!!!!
B00CASDZKC|5|These are exactly what we needed! Protects the seat and I don't constantly have to take shoes on and off. Good choice for us!
B002MQAX9S|2|OK.  I get it now.  I couldn't for the life of me figure out how the velcro &#34;helped&#34; with my HD half shell helmet.  I now understand-  these are for a VEGA Half Shell helmet.  Not necessarily very functional for other brands.  The velcro is sewn in so I can't really even move it to make my helmet functional.  So... my bad.  I should read the description a little better.  They &#34;may&#34; work for some other brands but the vega helmet strap has a &#34;v&#34; style chin strap that this is custom made for.  NOT A UNIVERSAL EAR PAD.  FWIW... for the price, the quality seemed fine.
B000IBU9QG|2|Initially, it was perfect! But then the nylon keeping the beeds together started tearing off after 2 weeks. Will not buy this brand again.
B008VGRMJC|5|Perfect!
B003BNJZFO|5|fit like a glove and fast service
B000BRJF62|4|I've been using one of these units for over eight years now. The only problem I have is the button switches on the remote wearing out. I ordered a new one but it did not have the jumpers installed for me to customize the switches. I've read about others having this same problem.  I sent it back and reordered and it again, hoping the next one will have the jumpers on the circuitboard.
B00S8ET146|5|Easy to install and look great fit tight to the body
B00MI5Q0HM|5|Excellent
B00E9SOXJS|4|Seem a little tight to get on but no complaints
B0022ZCI7Y|5|Works as expected and Great power improvment!
B00KTJ7VK4|5|Works like original easy to program
B00EDQZQJW|5|Fit like a glove.
B002GZ2TJM|1|Did not fit despite putting in make and model. Had to take to dealership for them to try. Now says un-returnable because to much time has lapsed.<br />Not happy
B009M0S8O4|3|Pretty easy to install. Fit well. Only lasted a few months. When the original handle broke, I was still able to open the door from the inside. After this one broke, the door won't open at all.
B0031BE6OQ|5|Very good quality at a good price. They don't hold a lot but it sure beats wearing a backpack. The reflective bit on the back of the bags is a nice addition but a bit plain looking. A reflective design or logo would be a nice touch.
B006MX7ZB6|1|Not very easy to install.  Just because they claim it will fit your car, doesn't mean that it will be easy to do so.  My car doesn't have the gaps needed to pull the bottom straps through.  I would have returned this item, but refused to pay a $9 restocking fee.  I figured that buy the time I bought new seat covers, I would ultimately be out the money.  Buyer beware!  Just because they are prime doesn't mean they can be returned easily.  Seat covers do have a nice feel to them, but they don't fit my car like they claimed and look somewhat cheap.  Update:  The nylon snags very easy. Not impressed.
B0018CP1IU|5|Put this unit in my 2003 Chevy S10 Crewcab and It delivered as advertised.  It did NOT cause my truck to be able to do burnouts... but it is much more responsive and the low RPM torque/power are noticeably better.  I would recommend.  Update 9/2/2015: After running this for a few weeks now, it seems to perform even better.  I am still very happy with the improved performance and recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive HP boost for a 4.3 vortech v6. (NOTE: I did do the cold air intake and exhaust upgrades as suggested by the product and paired it with a high output coil, wires, dist. cap and rotor button as well as a throttle body spacer.)
B003TQ4ADU|4|This is an awesome piece of equipment but you muse be careful about leaving it in a tool box when the weather starts to get cold.
B007D46HZ8|5|What an awesome decal! I received it on a 90 degree sunny day, so I let it cool off in the air conditioned house before I tried to apply it. I looked at the website that the enclosed paper referred me to, and did exactly as it said. I placed tape across the top edge and taped it in place on my car. When I was satisfied with the placement, I lifted the decal while using the tape like a hinge. Then I removed the waxy paper and affixed the decal to my car, rubbing over the backing paper with a piece of folded card stock. Quick, easy, and beautiful. My MINI Cooper is rocking the new &#34;tramp stamp&#34; on the rear bumper!
B0053P69IO|5|Fits my 2015 Toyota Sienna XLE AWD very nicely; the slightly curved design is aesthetically much more pleasing than the straight hitches often seen on the road. Installation required cutting out two small sections in the underbody panel, which is very easy to cut with a blade or scissors: one cutout on the left, where the hitch is mounted to the underbody (which can be made much smaller than seen in etrailer.com's installation video, just so that the mounting bracket fits through), and one cutout in the center where the hitch connector sticks out (there is a bulge in the Sienna's underbody panel not seen in the installation video - perhaps it's only present on AWD models). Looks great, almost as if it was an option provided by Toyota.
B00LYO08FS|4|First, it is too small, and since it is the largest they carry, there is nothing I can do about it. This 6X fits exactly the same as the 4X Harley Davidson.  I hope to shrink into it in time.<br /><br />However, it is very heavy duty, good quality, and the inside pockets are very deep.
B0073QVDAU|5|A completely cheaper and better axle. I have put 100 hours on it through desert mountain trails and desert dunes, hit rocks, debris, and jumped and it is still as straight as when it was new. It is a little wider, and longer, but it is way stronger than I realized. Thanks for the great product.
B00080QHMM|4|Like this a lot. Easy to use. Nothing to turn on/off. Very happy with this item so far!
B00B2ASZ18|5|Great
B000MWU5N8|5|Very nice cover /light weight /took on Sturgis bike trip /covered my bike at nite with luggage and w/o luggage  /cover it up also when parked in hot sun daytime /folds up nice /small and compact light wt / will always be carried in my saddlebags when ever I ride my bike
B000BGJWA2|5|i love it...as expected
B0091DJWV0|5|Did exactly as what I wanted it to do.
B008RD2WWQ|5|I have to say these people mean business clean blue and nice it is even have the road blue with one
B00O7XQXVQ|1|Was a good product before, till Australian company closed and moves production to China.<br />Bearings falied after 10 miles in the seasson
B000X8EGZE|5|Great product
B002MYLB1Y|4|nice straps
B011NSX27A|1|Ive tried everything I could to make this thing work, plugged it into two different cars, used two different phones. refreshed bluetooth, tried WIFI in case they gave me a WIFI version. Followed the instructions, when that didnt work tried every variation possible engine off/on electricity off/on.<br />All I can get it to do is light up red. Very disappointed
B001GJ3DZS|3|ehhhhh
B0010DSV1Q|1|This the second one I change in less than a year. Moving to Moog.
B009VIZBCY|5|OEM o2 sniffer, great quality look no further.
B003BGPBG8|5|getting noticeably higher boost on my gauge
B00PBRJ66Q|3|Fade really fast.
B006ZC03CC|5|Quick delivery. Instructions make it a breeze to install.
B00BGZ1VJC|1|I waited over a week for this part to arrive only to be wrong. Bummer!
B00BH1D4MC|4|looks good. feels good. i dont know about keeping this tiny allen wrench in car but im happy with this little simple product
B000BB7ABU|5|Used in the bed of a cub cadet side by side it looks and works great
B00CMX20H4|3|It's ok, not as loud as people would have you think but loud enough in traffic. I'd wish for something louder for my motorcycle though.
B001AGN6Z4|5|What a difference a new exhaust system made on my 2005 Grand Caravan.  I needed a new catalytic converter, and opted to replace the whole system in one move (especially since I am in New England and the components all rot out from the winter salt).<br /><br />I highly recommend having a local shop do the installation, as it is well worth the $$ to have the job done in an hour, and you still come out WAY ahead from having the local muffler shop sell you the material and labor.
B00DSVMCSQ|5|Excellent buy, fits as expected.  I use it a lot, love the multiple pockets and it's great for summer
B000WEMGCO|4|Exactly what I needed
B00EJ4LPGG|5|Great non DOT helmet!! Fits great, nice cushioning inside. Recommend.
B00VE1C3OK|1|After only 4 days the leather band came off. VERY POOR QUALITY. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR....
B000CQ6DIU|3|They severed there purpose.
B000CRCVNK|5|flawlessly awesome!
B0009OR9A6|3|it's made in china...not that its bad, but it does say made in USA on the product page
B0009H51KS|5|good air filter
B00KWGNR5C|5|Love it, just like original, fast delivery!
B000NBKI7Q|5|96 grand caravan 3.3L. the belt came off too many times and one time that was a horrible experience on the highway.  I finally broke the piggy bank and bought this kit...amazing.  Such a simple concept of adding walls to the pulley and using a double sided v ribbed belt.  Does the job. hasn''t come off since!!
B0080JSEII|5|Perfect direct bolt in and plug-in play part. Best thing is you can color match it to your car and its 1/4 of the cost at ANY body shop.
B001ADA13W|3|I expected a better way of mounting it in truck. I still like product, just not amazed. The directions are not very clear and photos are taken too far away to see strap placement clearly.
B005ETCYYC|5|Used for the rear diff on a 2005 Honda CRV. You'll need 2 bottles since it takes 1 and a little. Did wonders for the clunk,clunk,clunk sound we were getting on tight turns. Purchased with &#34;20mm Aluminum Crush Washer SW-04 - 5-Pack&#34; and &#34;Plews 55001 Lubrimatic Fluid Quart Pump,&#34; to complete the job.
B000AM8BF4|1|Garbage do not buy. Worked a few times about my 6-7 time I used it. Won't charge. Should have listened to other reviews. Waste of money.
B00AEK55WY|4|The LED light strips were very easy to install but would not recommend putting them on the outside of the vehicle. The 3m tape on it isn't that great so I put different double sided tape on the strips along with the tape that came on it. The lights are very bright.
B005K8IHKC|5|Perfect fit on my 2008 sentra
B000CPJLHG|5|Works great!
B00RM6Z1DQ|5|I tried six different LBS and a few big box stores and could not find anything that I could get over my calves. After much research I found these beauties that fit like a dream despite my large calves and quads. They are true to the sizing chart, and is the only brand that even makes pads for legs that big. Thanks 661 for ending my search and protecting my knees from the rocks and cactus in AZ. They are a great fit and feel light and aren't restrictive when pedaling.
B00ARUPXTQ|1|Does NOT fit in my 2012 F-150.
B000C42QJC|4|back to squealing tires!
B00NF1Q8P2|4|I have a 2008 mazdaspeed 3. Was a little hesitant about buying this but let me tell you it fits perfect. Can't figure out where the plastic pins go but it sits firm with provided hardware.
B00K55JMKY|5|fits like a glove
B00CPSXPUW|5|Fast shipping & great quality stickers! :)
B0002SQUVI|5|well as others have said the shipping method should have been better, it came in an unprotected little box and that annoyed me as this is a precision instrument....anyway it had acceptable tolerances after checking it against other straight edges in my shop---satisfied with look, feel and precision...would rec.
B000WEPI4M|5|This was exactly what I needed for my 95 Infiniti that does not have cup holders. The taller cups tend to tilt a little but it's SO much better than trying to put things inside of the arm rest. I would definitely buy this again.
B00JRE38EA|5|Just wanted to say that I got these for my motorcycle (2001 Ducati 996) and they actually dim!! They are diffuse enough to not have 'hotspots of brightness' and the fit perfectly. Just watch the polarity. Really awesome! I will update with a photo later...
B00FE0ZKZG|5|Great quality. Keeps its appearance over long periods of time Nice glossy finish. Very good.
B00W8IO40O|5|Great product, God Bless
B001PYU7B2|5|Great price for a hard to find quality replacement part. We have a 1977 jeep j10 truck. The original ones started leaking and rear brakes were not working right. Only other option was to buy rebuilding kit. They rarely work out very well from past experience.
B0041TELVU|5|Worked great!  Easy to install as well, didn't have to climb upside-down on my back at all, just had to scootch down under the glove box in my 2004 Aveo, after popping off the glove compartment and one crossbeam, to get to the 3 screws that held it in place.  Replacing this and the cabin filter, and it's like having a brand new air system in the car!
B00KRH1JKQ|5|GreAt buy and easy to install!!!
B00480GZ70|5|I purchased a pair of these 9004 bulbs for my wife's car and we were impressed with the improved beam pattern compared to the no-name generic bulbs we had been running previously. More light is projected  on the road and further ahead than with the generic bulbs and the difference in high beam/low beam angle is much more appropriate than with the old bulbs whose beam either lit the ground immediately in front of the bumper on low or shined too high on high beams.
B00TY78AAM|5|Look great.
B00CZG1U2Y|5|Works perfectly
B008NOPVSG|5|It's a quality OEM product. What else is there to say?!
B001O65OLY|5|They work for what it is intended for. Good quality.
B004JAVJTS|5|Fits perfectly
B00537FR08|5|Just what I was looking for. I use this when I leave my 2 5/16 hitch on the truck for a while. Ball stays greased and clean. Fits right on,  just need to angle it a little bit and give a little pressure. Once the air in in the cap escapes it slips right on. Hint: save the package to keep your greasy cap in when not in use.
B004KK553I|3|One of the rhinestones fell off before I even put it on my car but for the price if looks great!
B00GBVHPNW|5|I have starting of carpel tunnel and these gloves really help my wrist when riding. Great for gripping and I like the extra protection they give me.
B002P2ZU1A|5|love it! Still works after 7 years.
B00BI170BC|2|Didn't work as well as description stated. Used this on outdoor cushions as directed. Water repelled after first rain but didn't work after the second.
B00AM1Z67O|4|Good price..
B000AL8VD2|5|Excellent Product.
B00GA704W6|5|Perfect fit.
B00DF4C69G|4|Nice peg - no easy way to get it perfectly tightened - can only do by hand or with a rag wrapped around it & some channel locks (yet somehow I managed to chip the paint). Love PM products
B00099DW6G|1|Bought a &#34;new&#34; Optima battery with hopes of going out on my boat to fish, and after a full charge, it felt very underpowered.  Took it out a second time (after fully charging) and same scenario.  Went to my local Advanced Auto and had it tested.  The CCA (cold cranking amps) measured at 317 and the battery is rated for 900 CCA!  The battery needs to be replaced, it's a dud :(
B00IR2FDLY|5|Awesome riding Jacket.  Cool design and fits prefect!
B000N5OGTI|4|This was a perfect replacement for my '03 Indian Spirit. Not an improvement and not cheap, but just like the original and I'm riding again. I find it hard to find parts for the Indian and was glad Amazon had it.  I took a chance because it was not listed to fit the Indian, but it looked the same in the picture and turned out to be identical.
B000BGHSNK|5|Not as pictured, collar has an additional plastic knob to make it even easier to attach house mains to.
B000GTTQSC|5|worked great
B0053TVKT8|5|Great product very very very good quality works perfectly
B00EP1S69M|5|Received product and it was great. Easy to apply and product is durable and well made
B000JWQDJQ|1|Product arrived as expected. Packaging looked like it was run over by the truck that deliverd it. One of the shocks was removed from its original packaging the band that keeps them compressed was removed. So either I got someone's return that was damaged or Amazon didn't want to send a bigger box. Either way the product is damaged , I have no problem buying scratch and dent items if I'm paying scratch and dent prices. But I paid full price . If I didn't need my truck back together I would make Amazon replace these items. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!<br />Mike
B00GHT49K0|5|Perfect fit.
B0065SJID6|5|Looks great! I love it!!!!!!
B006D9W5FA|5|Works as promised. Place the first one on, wait 60-90 seconds to place the second one on the next tire (depending on desired pressure), repeat for the remaining tires. By the time you get around to the first tire again, it's nearly done. You can check your tire pressure right on top of the deflator which is fantastic. Although you can't set and forget like Staun version, these are so easy to use and about $50 cheaper!
B003FPF22I|4|They work for now. Until I get the Real HIDS. They project a nice white light like 5k HID with slight hint of blue.
B00OFU33PU|5|Exactly as it is described.  And exactly what I wanted for the cargo area to keep thing from rolling around.  We used the cooler portion for our groceries and it was cool when we got home about 30 mins.  You can always fold down the extra compartments when not using.  I love it.
B00LK25CHS|5|nicely complements the cat back exhaust system
B00E9D4NES|3|I have them havent tried putting on yet ,they look okay
B00M8FWGO8|5|Looks Great on my vehicle
B001FZNIL2|5|I purchased this without thinking. I got what I payed for though. I thought it would be a heavy nylon tail gate instead its more like vinyl very light material. It fits though and I can't complain for the price and quick delivery.
B007KP0J5O|5|Fits perfect.  A little different than the original for my craftsman 42&#34; deck.  Works perfectly and cranked after more than 15 startups.  Cant complain for the low price.
B00WDSVEE8|5|I've used these clip-ons for a few days and they work beautifully.  The ability to put them over my glasses with just one hand is a big deal for me because of an injury to my right arm which limits its use.
B000BZI1TG|5|Item shipped and was delivered fast part went right on no problems.
B00JIUL04S|1|Fit perfectly, quick shipping, will not work with factory center caps for a 2001 suburban 1500
B002AK2RU4|5|Received the lights very quickly. They look great. Can't wait to see them on my trailer.
B000TYQB14|5|Excellent fit rite in there perfect can't go wrong with Amazon
B000C9WLA6|5|I need to get another one!
B00SCHSNGG|5|just as listed
B00KCQSM84|5|The seat covers are great. Love them. The price was great for the quality. The Company shipped them fast and I received them before they said they would arrive. Highly recommend them.
B00A14QLMG|5|Easy to install and works great! However I am an electrician and familiar with wiring small devices. I recommend watching the YouTube video before anyone attempts changing these switches themselves.
B005O52SLK|5|Have many compliments on this helmet and the light color doesn't attract the sun as much.
B001OBIRLI|2|The caliper fit fine, but the bleeder hole is very loose.  I had to use thread sealer to stop it from leaking.  My guess is that I'll have to replace it the next time I need to bleed the brakes.
B00TKS3FQE|4|Really nice mats and they look pretty good in my car, but I wish they were packaged a little better. Mine all came bent and I'm probably gonna have to put a heavy book on top of each of them to get rid of the bent shape. Otherwise I'm happy with them!!
B00SDQPJHM|5|Got my boss with this one!
B000KKLLFS|5|Fits perfectly!
B00VF2A2F0|5|great
B00LHUI4XM|5|Delighted with the licence plate frames.
B004HCOE72|4|Watching several videos on YouTube regarding headlight restoration I decided to buy this product. Totally satisfied with the end result.<br /><br />See before and after photos.
B005H7D6Q6|5|fit perfectly - makes front of the truck look like new
B004FJPS5Y|4|Great product and was easy to install. Only draw back that it did not come with instructions. Easy to find online however. If you have all the right tool the install was easy with no unexpected issues. Recommend having a rotary cutting wheel (will need to cut current rail covers to specified lengths) and a set of plastic prying tools (used to remove rail covers and end cap).
B00415XAH0|5|Works fine.
B00O2XJ0PW|5|Very nice quality, use valet feature a bunch with parking garages in the city. Would love it to have car brand on it - feature request? Would buy again.
B002N5W8Q4|5|Worked as advertised,.  Ran from June 15 until Aug15 on two batteries and was still running when we got home. I shut it off and threw the batteries away every though they still were good, but didn't want to get mixed up and use them again.  Nothing spoiled melted and top shelf items were at least cool an usually cold.  It survived the test of 126 degrees in death valley.  Only suggestion , don't pack shelves to tightly so air can circulate as designed.
B0049POEDQ|1|Installed part and it did not work.  Suppose to be hydraulic system that was bled at factory, but had no pressure in clutch.
B001OMLA7K|5|Ok
B00EJFH6YA|5|A decent amount of light at a great price point. This does a great job of augmenting the lights on my truck while driving mountain roads.
B00NRVAPG8|5|Amazing product, super easy to hook in. Had a loose wire but took no time at all to fix oncee it was located. Other than that tiny delay I'm extremely satisfied and will be buying more for my family members.
