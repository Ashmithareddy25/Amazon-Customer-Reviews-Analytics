B0009RCPY8|5.0|Why are you even reading a review for this. One of the greatest comedies of all time. I wish they would release the second one on blu-ray. Man these movies are great. BUY IT!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the best running game on the app store. You can even adjust the graphics to improve them. Supercalafragilisticexpialadocus game!!!!!!<br />(Is that how you spell it?)
B000286RNY|5.0|Very funny funny funny  movie, funny comedia and marthial arts are so good, if you like this movie genere its 100% recomended
B003J7HOKU|5.0|Nice and heavy riffs, but great melody to it as well, so it's not just mindless punk-core with flashy riffs. It's a flavor of metal I'm really glad I discovered.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I previously lived in Dallas and I enjoyed reading about familiar landmarks in this very interesting story.  I looked forward to returning to the book every evening.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is awesome!  Could not put it down. Cannot  wait to start number three. A must read. Way to go!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|These movies look amazing. You see them all the time on network television but nothing looks like this. These movies are well worth the purchase. I have watched them multiple times since purchasing it.<br /><br />Audio is top notch.<br /><br />Buy it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Nothing really to say besides I love this app. I use it on my kindle and it has tons and tons of bible plans that are really easy to navigate. Best bible app I've found by far. I'd recommend to anybody looking for bible plans. You can highlight and bookmark and if you're falling behind on a plan, it makes it easy to catch up on. There are always new plans out too.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is my second favorite Christmas movie, and it is so good. It not only has the fun side of Christmas, but it also has the side of Faith and believing in what is not always there. Polar Express is weird though, because of the men that look a lot like Mr. Hanks, so have some laughs and get into the story!
1465001107|5.0|In my opinion, anything with MJ on it is going to be awesome!! There are great candid shots of him in concert.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I found this book extremely interesting and educational.  It gave me a totally new perspective on the influence of social forces on people's lives.  I would strongly recommend this book.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|I  really enjoy this this game. I just got it for free &amp;downoad.Of course i just started the game.  Thanks,Jacqueline03
B005PTYOTE|5.0|Man, Mission Impossible is a great movie. A classic if I say so myself. However the 2nd movie is garbage with all the face swapping stuff. They thought it would be a good plot twist but the audience knew better.<br /><br />Despite the flaws of the second movie I highly recommend picking this up. The audio and video quality are superb and increase the enjoyability of the movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I became a fan of Colleen Hoover's when I first read \\"Slammed.\\"  \\"Hopeless\\" exceeded my expectations.  It's about two teens who have some serious issues.  During the course of the book, they help each other heal.  The love between Holden and Sky is breathtaking.  Even though the events happen pretty quickly, they share an immediate bond which is completely believable.  I was hooked in the first chapter/section, and I never could have expected where the author took the story.  The ending leaves all the ends tied with a realistically happy ending (meaning, the reader will be satisfied but not due to an unlikely, cheesy, predictable conclusion).
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I have read all of Rhonda Byrne's books. Its very life changing, its fun and amazing to see what comes your way.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|Would give this 5 stars if you could play the entire game free, but you get two island free, with a third if you register for the news letter. Tuns of fun while it lasts! And worth the $ if you have it to buy the full version.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|great story. im glad that they got back together and are learning to work through their issues. i can relate to that part of the story. still some things are to detailed for me but its ok. great book
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|This game can be addicting as well as frustrating with time and expenses.... but overall ok...... hate the outrageous price diff when expanding or getting guys
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I am always looking for books that hold my attention, but that would also be a good read for my 11 year old.  While some of the Caster books' content may be difficult for her to follow, they aren't laden with sexual content or extreme adult situations.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This movie isn't perfect. However it's still a great movie. What makes this blu-ray worth buying is that it has the digital copy as well a DVD copy of the movie but it has some great extras. And because of those extras you can really see what Gavin O Conner's thought process was and what he hoped to achieve and he himself admits that not everyone might get it but he accomplished what he set out to do. So if you're looking for a great family drama in the MMA world, get it. You won't regret it.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|I had to stop the movie about ten minutes in. I dont know if it was not my style or what, but I couldnt get into it.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is a fun fast paced addictive game, I couldn&acute;t stop playing. I would recommend this game to my friends.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|the story was great. somethings were almost to detailed for me if you catch my drift. i really enjoyed the story line. the characters were great also. some things in the story were predictable tho.
B008MM9630|5.0|Fun and cute...... takes a bit long to gather gems and takes a way long time for plants to grow....would be great to gather coins and expand faster slower the game is faster I lose interest but it's ok
1455523550|5.0|Great book and great author!<br />Read this book in one day....and you just can't put it down!<br />Great read for pre-teen to adult.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Pretty fun game, sorta easy early on. The controls are good and the graphics look nice,  especially when the invincibility kicks in. Well done!
051756338X|5.0|I first read this book over 20 yrs ago. It is the start of the settlement of Sarum and how it evolves and the characters start the city of Salisbury, England.<br /><br />The next book by this author that I read was London, followed by The New Forest, the two-book saga of Dubling,Ireland, then New York, and finally Russka. These stories start with a few families and the beginning of their settlement and how it grew into a great city.<br /><br />This author does excellent, in-depth research of the history of the period he writes about, the living conditions of the time, and does a great as well, for building a genealogy of the families involved over the period of the centuries.<br /><br />I think anyone who has an interest in history, genealogy and who enjoys historical fiction will enjoy any of the books by this author. I might be biased since I have a great deal of genealogical connections to London, Salisbury, and New York.<br /><br />I have enjoyed each of his books and have pre-ordered his book \\"Paris\\" which is due out the end of April
B00785P2QC|5.0|The graphics are nice. like that the trucks keep going after the game shuts down. leveling is not as quick.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Love the books that Mr. Sparks writes.  Had to put down wanting to find out what happened next. You will enjoy this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a wonderful game. My daughter and I play it constantly! A+ game! I did get this game as a free game!
B0025TOH5S|5.0|this is my favorite movie and I watch it everyday.  it brings a warm feeling to me when I see couples make it against all odds.
0307959856|4.0|It took me reading the first half of the book in order to really get into it and see it on its own merits since I had in my mind, the Pride and Prejudice characters of Colin Firth and Elizabeth Erle. The screenwriter for the PBS series I watched was writing from a somewhat different poont of view than this author. All in all, I did enjoy the book.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I used to use a fan to sleep but it drove my husband crazy so finally I tried this app and now the fan is gone.<br />I
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is by far the best book he has written.  Had no idea that there was a moving coming out untill I was almost done.  Couldn't put this book down and at the end I cried.  Really gets you involved.  Love this book and highly recomend it!!!
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This is addictive, and ran flawlessly on my Motrola Xoom tablet. It turns from a eat-or-be-eaten game to a more difficult gravity challenge. As you progress in the campaign, you unlock randomized Arcade levels, so there is some replayability, but would have liked to see more levels designed in the campaign. Visible orbital path hints help to win the hard gravity levels, but IMHO show too dimly, and that can be frustrating. Crank the brightness!
B00B99KJR0|1.0|This will not install on my Kindle Fire. I loved Call of Atlantis and really want to play this game.I have tried many times with no luck.  Please fix.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Hadn't heard of this one before today.  I've played a ton of this game type over the years on my various android devices and this is one of the best ones I've played.  Rivals the mighty Radiant in retro shooter execution, but might just top it with free movement around the playing area and a wider variety of enemies to shoot.
B00785P2QC|5.0|awsom the game is relly fun.  you shoud buy it its free.  love it you will love it to.good by.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Lost almost an entire weekend as I simply could not put this book down. I was very drawn into the story- smoothly written and almost entirely plausible. Just a great read but heed my warning- prepare to lose yourself once you start this book!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I always pull this out and try a level or two on the bus or shuttle. Controls were a little tweaky on my Motorola Xoom, but an app update on the App Store fixed everything!
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|A professor of statistics once said that you can get cheap calculators for the class for less than ten dollars. We all need calculators for finance.
8866137634|5.0|I love this notebook and the 3-month Evernote Premium is the sugar on top<br /><br />That said it did take me 4 weeks from the day I placed my order to receive it through Amazon<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying one save yourself the frustration and go buy it locally
1741798981|3.0|I relied upon this publication's Maui book and it was wonderful...great maps, local insights,etc...but this book failed me on both.  To be fair, the maps are good, just placed kind of strangely to me...and, I didn't find the text that much fun to read.  It's a thick book and to me a lot of it concerned trips out of London (which I highly recommend,  having done them before) but that's not my focus this trip.  I guess I would recommend it with the caviat of giving it a look before purchasing.
B000002I4S|3.0|1. &#34;Giant Steps&#34; (4:47) cuts off about 5 seconds into song!!! That's pretty bad considering is the title song of album!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh my gosh!!!This game is great and super addicting. Even though it's free donint mean it won't work. Even my hubby plays this before he goes to sleep. Then once he's asleep I sneak his I pad out from under his pillow and play. And he is so addicted that when he plays it again he can tell that I just played it. I love both of em. Lol :)
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good read.  I liked the Lucas Davenport and Virgil Flower series, and I enjoyed Harry Bosch.  This is the first one I have read.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Simple, small and as long as you have a reliable micro-sd card you are good to go (can't say that for the SanDisk 32gb). I keep this in my wallet and take it out when I need to move/copy large files that will be used by my Android. Make sure you insert with contact-terminal side up!
1423119509|5.0|I read the first book and was hooked on Percy. I just had to have the rest of the collection.
B00746TURW|5.0|The first sentences lead one to believe this will be a romp-a pacy page turner. Nothing could be further from the truth. -though it is hugely engrossing. The slow deliberate pace takes getting used to but the characters are so well drawn it made me want to keep reading. I was half way through before the scene changed to Canada !<br />This is about Waiting. Waiting for the robbery. Waiting to get to Canada. Waiting for something bad to happen to Arthur Remlinger.<br />Yet, because Richard Ford writes so well it all works. We actually care about the people and can almost see the &#34;shack&#34; in Canada and feel the isolation and lonliness of Dell. .It is also a novel about Loss..about being on the margins..<br />I was left thinking about the characters and several vivid scenes long after I put the book down. A good sign.<br />Well worth reading.
B006HL9G10|2.0|o kay, have to say I don't like it because I don't 'get it' Not sure I would recommend it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm a OneNote user and I have been trying to find the Linux / Android alternative and none of them really stack up to OneNote. Still trying and will continue to tinker with evernote.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I was a bit skeptical, because I've never been a HUGE JT fan, but this album is FANTASTIC. I felt like each track was better than the last, and I love the different feel each song has. It's sexy as hell, too. Every other album that comes out this year is going to have a lot to live up to.
B000066NW0|5.0|She is my son's favorite singer.  I have even begun to enjoy some of her songs as we are riding in the car together.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the best alarm clock available by far! I have two different alarm times each night and you can name them. Both my alarm times have my own music and each song is different. It's very reliable also.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Earth Rocker is another amazing album for Clutch. It's more upbeat than Strange Cousins From The West and is definitely one of my favorites now.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|Technically it installs and works as advertised still have not found it useful. But since I have just started with Evernote and Skitch I'm still trying.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Fun characters that entertained our grandchildren & also was enjoyable for us as well.  Watching them react with laughter, not fear, made this movie time together even more special.  I will be recommending this movie to our friends & family.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|While I was sick and my son was driving me to the doctor we listened to the CD.  I was fun to listen to.
1476733953|5.0|Review for Wool by Hugh Howey<br />I thought I knew where the title came from. Was it because they used wool to clean the lens to the outside or was it because everyone had wool pulled over their eyes? I never figured it out and I guess in the end it doesn't matter, maybe it's a little of both. The Year is the future and we have left the Earth uninhabitable. The only way to survive is to live underground in a Silo. There is no sunlight and the only view of the earth is through some cameras positioned outside. The only way to keep the camera lens clean is for someone to clean it. In the future punishment for any crime, determines that you get put out, oh and while you're there, clean the lens. This book will grip you from page one, but be forewarned, don't get too attached to anyone, they are not guaranteed to survive. Our heroine is Juliette, a mechanic turned hero. Follow Jules on her adventures through the silo where all is not what it seems. Any fans of science fiction or dystopian novels will love this series. Jules is a grade a badass!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game it is so much fun I can play it all day. This is better than temple run. Best game yet.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|What else can you say? For the casual weather observer this app shows you all the weather information that you need.
B00BQUUH7E|1.0|My buck was taken, for a game that will not open for me.  Please fix the game or refund my money.  No way to do business.  Disappointed!
B000NA1OXY|5.0|Avril was one of the best gifts I gave my son.  She is his favorite singer.  I would buy more.

B004GJXQ20|5.0|Amazing story line, characters are realistic, its it just really really good and sooo interesting.<br />Jess .<br /><br />Cant wait to read book 2
0316228532|4.0|This book was a bit like a 19th century book, or an advent calendar.  She painted a good story of a small town with a surprisingly dramatic ending.  The book was better than the reviews of it, but not five stars.
1400069807|5.0|Of course there are \\"smoking guns\\" in the food industry.  I won't use this space to give my own point of view, we are all passionate about this issue, whatever our views.  Moss is an excellent journalist, a wonderful writer, and an author who has contributed significantly to society.  This book is great, worth getting and reading and sharing.
B005K17RU0|1.0|this app was excellent before the recent upgrades. unfortunately,  now it's inconvenient and not very useful. the upgrade is hard to operate
1616550414|5.0|Best videogame book ever! it has a LOT of concept art,level design and even a Manga!  worth every cent i spent!
B000FDVOXO|5.0|I really love Terminator 2! When it would come on tv I would stay up late and watch it & I love the music cause it reminds me of the show at Universal Studios Hollywood which closed Dec 31, 2012. I really miss the show!:( I want to get the movie just because of the special features & watch some of my favorite parts! Terminator 2 is the greatest movie of all time & will always be my favorite!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Good game play, good graphics, NO IN APP PURCHASES!  I really like this for my Kindle Fire. Just one finger required, and start blasting away at incoming spacecraft. I can play this without getting killed immediately. What a nice surprise to find this for free and I don't want to delete it after a few rounds.
B0015DROBO|5.0|One of the best trilogies I've read. Reading it a second time.  Will read it probably a third time. Absolutely great.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Truly love this app. Very user friendly. Love that it works on my non-top of the line tablet. Good for all ages. Lots of free puzzles.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I got this app because I'm into editing photos just for fun. I was amazed at how great this app really is! It is so easy to use, and when you're done fixing your photos you can save them and share them! It works great for Kindle Fire&reg;. I promise you won't regret downloading this app.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|This is an excellent compilation for any mystery reader!  The usage of dated British terminology takes a few stories to get used to but after that it is great!  A must have for any Sherlock Holmes fan.
159562015X|5.0|used it on our church staff team, really got each of us on the nose!  Highly recommend this book for everyone.
B00164CM46|5.0|You have to add this movie to your blu ray collection.  I am a huge fan of Guy Ritchie and this movie is brilliant.  I love the way he directs.  Great writing and outstanding cast.  Hilarious.  BUY IT!
B00123LIPK|5.0|If you love the 80s and early 90s, this is for you. I've had this since it was released in vinyl and to this day remains my favorite album of all time. It's hard to even skip a song because they are all good. Finally have it in digital and listening to it right now. Love you Madonna!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Even though I loved this game when I first bought it, I had to delete it after a few days.  Every time I played it, it killed my battery after only five or ten minutes of play.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is way better than the first and if u want to get this app don't think twice before downloading.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Do you remember your first love? Eleanor & Park will make you feel as if you are experiencing it all over again. I am 53 years old, and this book that is marketed for teens was enthralling to me. The characters really came to life and made you feel that you really knew them. I would recommend this book to anyone, although I believe that females will appreciate it the most - females of any age.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|i saw this movie back in 2007  in the theaters, and i was with my mouth open the whole time, its that good, awesome cinematography, and great long shot scenes, this movie is a most see.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A few books into the Op-Center and Splinter Cell era, I stopped reading them. They were fluff, and really, just short stories, and utterly devoid of the action and depth that TC's previous novels delivered. Certainly not worth the money charged. I won't buy them used, because they're not even worth the shipping cost. Then the big novels themselves made a bad left turn, and the stories started diverging, and getting thinner and then finally, I just gave up. Maybe by then it was Without Remorse. TC was working with co-authors, and it was clear that he didn't give a royal rat's @#$@#%#$^ about the quality of the work, he was just squirting s*** in an attempt to keep the franchise alive. I swore off anything with his name and a co-author's name on it.    Several other authors, whose work I'd enjoyed in the past, had also gone this direction (co-authoring), and I noticed the degradation in their work as well. I finally got wise and boycotted their books as well. I think that Dale Brown has fallen into this trap; the copyright on his books is held by a corporation, so perhaps there is a room full of monkeys and typewriters out there cranking out his books (proof of concept?). They read like it. Some authors even tried nepotism (Clive Cussler, W.E.B. Griffin), with not much better result. Not even shared DNA can save them.    I think I got a come-on from Amazon about this book, and I read the sample chapter, and looked at reviews (with a jaundiced eye), and decided to give TC another chance. This actually looked good, and Jack Ryan was back in the meat of the story.    I waded into the story and was hooked. Fairly quickly, and I recognized the old tell-tales: staying up really late reading (6am), putting off work to read instead, etc. It was the old TC, back, with the details that always made his novels fun to read, and the multiple storylines running in parallel. Jack Jr. has a real role in this, and there's a love interest now for him. Sadly, I didn't notice what happened to Jr's other siblings; there were three children, but only one was in this story.    Working backwards, I just finished Locked On, by the same co-author, and I need to say that I also enjoyed it immensely. I probably should have done other things this morning, but finished the book instead. I may look back one more novel, to see if Mark Greany was involved. If he was, then I might give it a glance. My prejudice about co-authored books still stands, but at least for now, TC, you have somewhat vindicated yourself. I hope you have more story ideas sitting around. I like what you do, as long as you're doing most of the heavy lifting. Four stars, not five, because it is co-authored.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Well written, humorous, and fast moving. I loved the twists and turns as well as the development of Cat's and Bones's relationship.

B00AYR2FOI|5.0|As just about anyone over the age of 50 well knows it extremely difficult to find any new music to get excited about these days.  I scan the \\"new releases\\" on amazon.com each week in the hopes of finding a disc or two that I might actually be interested in.  After perusing a list that includes such offerings as \\"Venemous Rat Regeneration Vendor\\" by Rob Zombie and \\"Cometary Orbital Drive to 2199\\" by Acid Mother's Temple I usually just roll my eyes and give up.  However, a few weeks ago I discovered that the venerable American singer, songwriter and guitarist Boz Scaggs was about to release a new album.  I had very high hopes for \\"Memphis\\" and I must tell you that the artist does not disappoint.  If you love R&B add this to your shopping list right away.  It is a real treat.<br /><br />Recorded at Willie Mitchell's legendary Royal Studio, \\"Memphis\\" offers up a dozen tunes in a variety of styles.  Only about half of the songs were familiar to me but I must say that I enjoyed each and every one of them.  My favorite has to be \\"Rainy Night in Georgia\\" which turns out to be every bit as compelling as the Brook Benton original.  The debut single from the album is a tune from the pen of Willie Deville called \\"Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl\\".  I had never heard this one before.  What a great song! Scaggs also does a fine job on a pair of circa 1970 hits including \\"Love On A Two Way Street\\" and a cover of Tyrone Davis' \\"Can I Change My Mind\\".  Meanwhile, I really enjoyed \\"Cadillac Walk\\" with that unmistakable Chuck Berry sound!  I was also extremely impressed with a pair of other tunes that I was totally unfamiliar with.  Be sure to check out \\"So Good To Be Here\\" which was written by Al Green and most especially \\"Pearl of the Quarter\\" a tune that was penned by Walter Fagen and Walter Becker of Steely Dan fame.  For those who dig the blues there's the down and dirty \\"Dry Spell\\".  And I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of Boz Scaggs totally original take on the traditional country-blues song \\"Corrina, Corrina which was written back in 1928.<br /><br />\\"Memphis\\" is a simply a joy to listen to and I suspect will be a steady seller for quite some time to come.  I thought that Boz Scaggs was completely in his element with this material.  The backup musicians were outstanding and the quality of the recording superb.  A well-conceived project flawlessly executed.  Very highly recommended!country-blues song \\"Corrina, Corrina which was written back in 1928.<br /><br />\\"Memphis\\" is a simply a joy to listen to and I suspect will be a steady seller for quite some time to come.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Easy enough to not have to use the &quot;hint&quot; button all the time but certainly challenging enough for an experienced player. Some of the extra mini-games made it interesting and filled out the story a bit more. Enjoyed!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is fun for all ages. My son and I both play it. Not to mention it is free!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Enjoyed the story line and characters. One of the better Harry novels I have read.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes a good mystery
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|The Eagles, for me, weren't that great.  I mean I heard the music on the radio and at friends homes-but I never bought any.  I was more interested in Zepplin, Moody Blues, stuff like that.  BUT, this documentary was/is outstanding, for the music, for the history, for the band members who came and went, and for the stories over their 40 years and still going.  This documentary is so worth your time, especially if you \\"grew up\\" in the 70s.  It was really really good, congrats to the band members-who tell it like is/was and the creators of the documentary.  BTW_I saw it over and over on showtime.
B006ICOK00|3.0|Link to footage shot with Brinno TLC200<br /><br />[...] (Amazon doesn't allow linking to youtube, so go there and search \\"NATURE'S RECLAMATION OF RUDOLF - Brinno TLC200 time lapse test - ANAKRID\\")<br /><br />My review of the Brinno TLC200 after conducting this test: As you can see, the camera is able to do what it advertises: take time-lapse video. However, there are many problems with this camera. Much of the initial footage was lost due to some problem with the camera losing *entire files* (which take hours to create). This is why the images in this film jump from very little decimation of the creature to intense putrefaction. All of the in-between footage was lost (including what should have been footage of a vulture working on poor Rudolf!). This problem with lost footage was solved by a download of a firmware update from the Brinno site. If you purchase this camera it is *imperative* that you download this update - you will save yourself many headaches. The camera handles bright sunlight very poorly and much footage had to be thrown out because of blown-out images. Overall it has absolutely terrible dynamic range. The color needed major correction in Sony Vegas and even with that, it still isn't hot. It is essentially a toy camera. Having said that, it is capable of capturing some wonderful images (if you get lucky). I got this camera on sale for very cheap. If you can score one for a low cost, I'd recommend it to play with - but I wouldn't use it for any critical projects.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I'm confused it wont download when I try It goes straight error has occored when downloading this app. please fix.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|One of those games that can be a bit of a challenge. Just good entertainment.  I think I personally am still drawn to word games
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|I got the app and it worked good for about 5 miniuts and was great, but it started to get really slow and laggy. I wouldn't waist my time
B009UKUGXC|5.0|Absolutely enjoyed it. Could hardly put it down and ended up reading it within 3 days.Simon Singh describes in a very readable way how earlier attempts to solve this theorem while unsuccessful , developed new mathematical tools/techniques. Ultimately Wiles used maths that (probably) did not exist in Fermat's time to find a general proof for this theorem.Given that the maths used in solving this theorem was developed well after Fermat's time,it seems doubtful that Fermat really had a general proof for this theorem.(Unless , of course he developed a form of mathematics that was subsequently lost and remains unknown to present day mathematicians)<br /><br />You do not really need to understand much maths to read this book, and it should be accessible to all people who have done maths to high school level
B0071XO8RA|5.0|All the other reviewers have said it, this series should be a classic but hey, there is power in numbers, so I'll add my voice.<br /><br />The things I like about Howey's style:<br /><br />* The alternative future is very well thought out and does not rely on magic, fantasy, or alternative states of being.<br />* There is a love storyline, which is fine, but the plot is not bogged down in graphic sex and excessive romance.<br />* Similarly, the violence is essential to the story and not pornographic.<br />* Strong and believable characters of all genders and ages populate the world - this is not a mean feat!<br />* The pacing is excellent.<br />* The end of the series is a self-contained end, and it still leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />In short, I will waste no more time writing this review and am spending it more meaningfully exploring other Silo universe works.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Having enjoyed many of the original Hitchcock TV series and movies, I found this movie to be a wonderful portrayal of a master and the relationship he had with his wife in his productions and their lives.  Loved it!
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I had to apply this to my ATI Radeon 5800 graphics card chip when I bought a replacement fan;  seemed a little pricey but the online how-to instructions said I needed to use only thermal compound case.  My card now stays well within temperature limits, so I guess this stuff did the trick!  At least I only needed half of it...saving the other half &#34;just in case&#34;.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|cute fluff story, what I'd expect from Harleqiun - a sweet, pretty cut and dry romance story with a bit of steam here and there.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I like the Pendergast books and this one started out very exciting and a real page turner, the last half of the book turned into a never ending boring chase similar to the boring car chases that spoil every movie. I skimmed through the last part of the book and there were about 5 pages worth reading to get the gist of the story. I gave it three stars only because of the beginning of the book.
B000JML7EC|1.0|I did not read this book.  It was downloaded by accident.  I don't plan on reading it.  Can't recommend it.
B00846REIS|5.0|What a great story. This was as enjoyable as reflections in you if not better! Can't wait for the next book!
B002MFX0RQ|3.0|Liked the idea of the movie but the supporting cast really annoyed me. Harvey was loveable and  beliveable! It's a maybe.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a very well written biography of Lincoln and the other men who sought the presidency in 1860--William Seward, Salmon Chase, and Edward Bates. Of the four men, Lincoln seemed the least likely to prevail but he ultimately won the nomination and the Presidency. Following the old saw of keep your friends close and your enemies closer, Lincoln appointed each of his competitors to a position in his cabinet. This book relates the interactions between the four  men and the resulting team effort that ultimately ended the Civil War and united the country. This book was obviously researched in great detail and the result is a compelling and interesting story of the men, the times, and the tumultuous events that combined to make Lincoln the great historical figure he has become over the ages. Excellent book and deserving of the highest recommendation.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read several of his books and I like the way he writes his stories.  I not finished with the book but I'm enjoying it.
B0024F08RO|5.0|Although not as jaw dropping good as seasons one and two, season four was thoroughly entertaining!  You do need to suspend belief.  The situations and coincidences may seem a bit farfetched, but then again, so is the entire premise for the series!  It is sit-on-the-edge of your seat entertainment.  The end will leave you begging for more, and thankfully, there is a movie to tie the ends together.  Have recommended this series (all seasons) to any number of people, and all have enjoyed it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I'm totally sucked into this game. Got my mother in law to play it as well. Very fun. Does require to be on internet when playing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because it's AMAZING I've never played a better game.I wish it would give you more coins .
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a guy's guy book.  Well written and i enjoyed it.  It's too bad his life has ended prematurely.  RIP
B0034G4P80|5.0|If only I was twenty years younger.......very good and very enjoyable.....looking forward to round two, coming out soon....more words....and still more words.......I'm not liking this rating program.  Buy the movie..
B00005AWMF|5.0|My wife was totally suprised have received this as a gift. We committed to spending limit this year and kept to it. It was either a toothbrush or this!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Bond has never been better, even in this antithesis chapter. Sometimes purity and fallacy can be the best story. Great
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My son adores this movie.  Our favorite of the Dr. Seuss movies.  Expresses the value of trees and teaches children.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Nice version of an interesting back-story for the X-Men universe.  Okay so this damned thing says I have to write ten more words....so I wrote ten more words......it's good, buy it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham mentions at the acknowledgements that he was lazy in writing this.  It follows his usual formula of creating a implausible situation that the reader cannot untangle because the facts are not revealed until the narrator finally tells all at the end.<br /><br />Grisham seems to be evem more antagonistic and disguted with the Federal law enforcement than usual in this book.  It does not seem to be necessary to the story but I guess it is part of his shtick.<br /><br />All in all, it was a good read, he still has the ability to keep you interested enough to want to find out what the whole story is, unfortunately, when you do find out, it is not wholly satisfying.
B008JEJPSC|5.0|This new 30th Anniversary Sing-Along edition of ANNIE in BLU RAY is in the film's original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.40:1. Amazon should delete all the above D V D reviews as they steer potential buyers away from purchasing the BEST home video presentation of ANNIE in many years. Those customers interested in a Pan & Scan presentation should buy the DVD. This blu ray is in WIDESCREEN!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much and I highly recommend it!! It really tells us how someone can turn their life around and go on to become a navy seal.
0062206044|3.0|I liked the voice of the narrator enormously and the difference from the everyday happily-ever-after type of story.  The story was very interesting and easy to get through.  The narrator's direct interaction with me as the reader was a treat and though he used words rather sparingly he made the characters very vivid for me.  The simple, non-flowery style of writing fit the story incredibly well, in a way I would not have expected before reading this book, and I would think very appropriate for a Juvenile reader.  The writing style actually kind of reminded me of C.S. Lewis from the Chronicles of Narnia.  C.S. Lewis wove together magical epic tales in his books, but the details were very sparse and left up to the imagination of the reader to fill in.<br /><br />For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot com
0743270754|5.0|In Love With Lincoln<br />Metaphorically Speaking<br /><br />(My humble tribute to this great man. I wrote this before reading Goodwin's wonderful book, so I have always had such admiration for Abraham. Goodwin's writing carried me for many hours on a most excellent trip to the past and into the heart of a hero. I felt even more respect for him as a result of reading her work).<br /><br />\\"Honestly, Abe, did you ever think you would have so many designations? Father Abraham, some called you. Others referred to you as a country bumpkin or a monolith from whom melancholy dripped. An impoverished westerner. Someone said that in all of your likenesses you appear lonely. You were rumpled in appearance and that thatch of dark hair forever had its own way. You were rangy, all hands and legs and leaned forward while walking. You spoke to the humblest of people and wrote the greatest speech in our war-torn history. Only 56 years old when you died, but you looked much older. We have heard it said that some people are just born old, but reading your account tells us differently. You had great humor and loved to tell jokes and stories, some of which were a little salty. Many narratives been credited to your name. Could you have said all of those things? Among the things we can be sure of are your devotion to your family, your devotion to the Union and your reliance upon Diety. During the stressful war time you said, 'I have often gone to my knees because there was nowhere else to go.'<br />Historians and countless others have attached themselves to your memory, if only to identify in some mystic way with the mixture of myth and reality that is Abraham Lincoln. You made homeliness handsome and countrified courageous.<br />Many qualities are attributed to you, Abe, and many praises recorded. 'A tree is best measured when it is down.' 'Now he belongs to the ages,'(or angels, depending upon whose account is believed). Either way, Abraham, you are so venerated that your face belongson a million dollar bill, not just the fivers and pennies. I would like to one day meet you and shake your lean hand and thank you for your life and example.\\"<br />Barbara Miller, author, \\"Jesse's Highway\\"
B009YX02T8|2.0|I bought this album when it was on sale hoping to get some good songs.  I didn't like any of the songs on this album.  I probably should have previewed the songs first.  Since music is so subjective please listen to the songs and judge them for yourself.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Can't wait til second one comes out!!!! My entire family absolutely loves this movie. Has adult humor that kids don't get so parents aren't bored watching kids movies!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Like all of his books I loved this story . I had a hard time putting this book down. I can't wait for the next book!
B009Z5975A|5.0|What does it cost to relive the past?  Watching these movies with my kids and sharing memories of the first time I saw them in my youth....priceless!
030758836X|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It has so many twists and turns that make it compelling to read. Our Book Club read this and loved it.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I had actually purchased the special edition version from Target which includes 2 extra bonus songs. I like Justin Timberlake and especially his last album as I do really like Timberland but found out that I was a bit disappointed. To be honest It seems that every song sounds the same. Mostly slow grooves and his high pitched falsetto's become boring after awhile. I found myself clicking the next botton on more than occassion hoping there would be a song with a different sound or something with a dance beat to it. And what is up with him repeating lines or phrases over and over again? Think that the hype will be huge on this one but will no doubt quickly fizzle.
B004NOH9LC|1.0|The stupid 1-click ordering button is enabled for all digital downloads. I don't believe it's fair. Amazon have always had an excellent customer service, but recently it's going down. It's insulting to customers not to let them have a choice to reconsider the order. Even more, if the customer has 1-click ordering turned off, Amazon should not make the user have it enabled for digital orders. This is more like: &#34;we will let you disable 1-click ordering for other sellers, but we will not let you do that for our marketplaces.&#34;
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is a simple match-3 with the addition of little tricks like frozen pieces. The storyline also adds a little entertainment. If you like quick, easy games you can pick up for a few minutes or a few hours, depending on your mood, as a relaxing way to rest your brain, you like this game.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The Abyss is very addicting! I can't seem to put it down. G5 Entertainment knows how to create great games.
B004222UC8|5.0|I recommend this album to anyone that is a Black Sabbath fan when you hear the opening riff from Tony Iommi and hear Tony Martin singing it would bring you goose bumps, cause you would think it would have been Dio on vocals.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|I have always wanted this CD and I finally purchased it and my only regret is that I did not buy it a long time ago.  This is some great music and a very creative concept album.  Definitely a classic that I highly recommended to any music lover.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Just an absolutely phenomenal and brilliant CD that will reach in and just wrap your musical soul with such a joyous and exhilarating feeling. Definitely one of his best ♫ !!! ♫
B005T87QCI|1.0|The game is blurry when the robots move and it wakes it hard to play and view. I bought the add on to create your own robot and all i could do was stick a different robots head on another body.Also when i decided to uninstall, I later re install and i could no longer create a robot and it asked to but it again. over all the game was crap for the Galaxy S3
B00821OX98|5.0|THe plot was very interesting and intense. Demands your attention, the Action was unbelievable, fast moving. The  Shanghi glass reflection was candy to your eyes, like looking at a prism, beautiful color. Everyone will enjoy this movie.
B0012GMV76|5.0|I love Concierto de Aranjuez and when I heard Jim Hall's version on my local jazz station I HAD to get it.  This is a truly great recording and I highly recommend it.
B00B45FO7E|5.0|Apparently Karl has been collecting snippets of music from many decades and many of the tracks sound as if they stepped just off of a Kraftwerk album, especially around the &#34;Trans Europe&#34; and &#34;Computer World&#34; times.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|The show continues to amaze and leaves me on the seat of my chair at the end of every episode.  This is a great example of how good TV can be.  Kudos also goes to the shipper!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I am a huge fan of Gillian Flynn. It was slow moving at first but alot of twist and turns.  Can't wait for the next 1. I will definitely read anything she writes. She is absolutely amazing.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a fun game that manages to be challenging and soothing at the same time. Very relaxing to play.
8866131377|5.0|NOt a lot of space per day, but the notes page on the side is awesome. Very good small planner and excellent for the price.
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|This release has been worth the wait. Recorded and produced very well. Great songs choices, really happy and can't wait for the next one
B00BJS7104|1.0|Can't wait to watch Jamie Foxx a \\"Racist\\"in real life play a slave killing a alot of white people,what a joy! When hollywood is done we will all be white trash, so grab your family and watch this great movie.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|I am enjoying this book.  Helps you focus on the positive aspect when trying to solve a business problem.  I recommend this book.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|This was about what I expected.  Typical Hollywood production that is mostly about visuals and special effects.  Good performance by the actor who played Pi (both young and old)  but very fluffy and sanitized for popular consumption.  Do yourself a favor and read the book first - otherwise the movie will ruin a great story for you!
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I loved it came right on time, it shows amazing the the price was a steal great service can't wait till you guys start selling season 3
B00881VLCE|5.0|This puzzle app is great. I am really enjoying this and am very happy with the amount of free puzzles available.  There is a great variety of beautiful art work to choose from.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Since i come from Iceland i will always rate my fellow icelanders as the best. What i really like is that when i visit the states they seem to be on every playlist on every station. how about that... five for that -  keep up the good work and don´t wear out.
0307266303|4.0|I hate to run.  I have played sport my whole life and ther is nothing I hate more than running for the sake of running with no goal in mind.  One of the reasons is the pain that almost immediately sets in when I settle into a running gait.  This book made me think that maybe this is more in my mechanics than in my head.  I still hate to run, but I can run farther with less fatigue and joint pain than I ever have before. (I still run with shoes!)<br /><br />Very interesting story that challenges many of our popularly held beliefs around running and gear.  I thoroughly enjoyed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Enjoyed the book a lot.it had great energy. The ending could not have been any better. Reminds us of the good times and the bad, we must still go on.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|You will be playing this game for hours. It is so much fun & the animals are funny when they do tricks or if you touch them.  The graphics are fantastic. On Fridays, they have special sales on certain animals or on peanuts ( real $$$$ ) Gameloft might double the amount of peanuts you get for your dollar, etc. I love catching the animals in the wild or ocean. The animals can be bred in the nursery & you see certain animals rocking their babies cradles. It's absolutely adorable.It is an addictive game!<br />But.........  there are several technical glitches! I seem to have two versions of the game mixed in one, well kind of. I have the picture of Wonder Zoo - Animal & Dinasaur Rescue in my apps. That was NOT the original picture I had. But my game has nothing to do with Dinosaurs yet Amazon claims I already have the app which I do not.  My original game was downloaded the same day as my grandson's. He had river & artic animals. I did not & I have the better kindle. So then I updated & everything was fine until this dinosaur picture came up.  Now I can not expand my zoo & certain areas are frozen. Sometimes the animals freeze or their coin to feed them. I have hours put into this game & cash so I do not want to delete & start over.<br />Also get one animal of each species so you can keep expanding. Then go back & get your other animal & start breeding. I think if you have a certain # of animals (counting babies) you can't expand any more. I was getting male & female & breeding each animal at least once. Make your habitats, put ONE animal in each & then continue to grow each habitat. I think that's the trick of the game.  Gameloft adds animals but I can't expand so I can't get many of the new animals. & like I said, I paid REAL cash for many animals. You have to if you want them.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Learned a lot about animals in a zoo atmosphere which I didn't know before.  Well written.  A very fast read.
B009KEN87O|5.0|It feels like an 80s retro game but the graphics are modern day. Interesting twist on some old games.  Very addicting. Worth paying for.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|i ordered this movie last night. Watched part of it and was planning on finishing tonight, but i no longer have access.  Now my 48 hr subscription will run out and I won't have seen the majority of the movie. Hoping amazon gives me some kind of rental credit.  Feeling like they just fleeced me for four bucks.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was the first I've read by this author and once I got used to her writing style it was easy to read.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is just a great help when playing Words With Friends. Download it if you get the chance. It also helps for other times too when you need the correct spelling of a word. Very easy to use.
B009KEN87O|5.0|If it was in a arcade I would be feeding quarters into.  Its is great to see a app that is make correct
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game of hidden objects. You have to perform quests that are accomplished after hidden object puzzles that may seem repetitive, but I like them. I've never paid a dime on this game, but it does help to have friends in the game to help you out. You do need to wait for your energy to regenerate, but you can find powerups to speed it up. If you want easy, this is not the game for you.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|Really liked the quality of the set, looked amazing on my big screen at home and with surround sound it just made it better. The only problem I had with it where the changes that Lucas made to the films. Besides that this is definitely worth the money and the time to watch them all.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|its ok but it takes a long time to download and thats for sure... it took at least five minutes to down load. but at least its fun!!!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I was not expecting much, but three books for five dollars on Kindle was an offer that was hard to refuse.<br />Unexpectedly enjoyable to read, and there are moments when, especially in the first book, it reads like one of the great dystopian novels of the late forties.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Great way to prepare our hearts for the gift of Easter.  It helps us remember the huge love gift that God gave us in His Son and how badly we need to be forgiven so we can be set free.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|This is an extremely well-directed movie by Christopher McQuarrie and had unfortunate timing in the United States with the Newtown school shooting. This is set in the same state as those school shootings and opened in the same week. The film suffered as a result of that tragedy at the North American box-office. The film opens on a disturbing scene of a sniper supposedly shooting innocent bystanders? The film goes into different perspectives of that opening set-piece in the movie as clues are being fed to the audience. The film is shot with interesting camera angles that photographically draws the audience into the narrative.<br /><br />Tom Cruise was unjustly criticized for taking this role as he bares little resemblance to Lee Childs character as written in the books. Tom Cruise convinces with his acting ability and the fight scenes are extremely believable. Tom Cruise is an effective actor and carries the role well.<br /><br />My only problem was Werner Herzog as the villian. Herzog has screen presence but has an extremely underwritten role.<br />A lot of the villians in Tom Cruise movies the villian is underdeveloped, from THE MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE films, and with Jack Reacher. I've always thought if a film has a well-developed, overwhelming villian the hero comes off looking better and more heroic. Still JACK REACHER is another really good action/thriller with a top car chase sequence not seen since THE FRENCH CONNECTION and BULLIT. The sequel is already in the planning. Best five Tom Cruise films 5:MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 4: MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE GHOST PROTOCOL 3:JACK REACHER 2:THE FIRM 1:MINORITY REPORT<br />Good mention COLLATERAL and the underrated VALKYRIE
B0061JPT46|5.0|The Beatles - \\"Hey Jude\\" cd or record is a must have for the Beatles fan. One of the last recordings by the band before they broke-up. Most of the recordings are from the \\"B\\" side of their albums. Just great music from an iconic band. Computers can't write this type of quality. Great band = great music. Can't miss !!!
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|There were beautiful scenes and wonderful photography. The music wasn't bad as well It good as video can get on bluray and a HDTV.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this story. I like how it twisted from what I thought it was going to be, even when I didn't like the way it was going it turned out better then I was planning. An amazing story that will keep you guessing till the end!
B009UNH0EM|5.0|I purchased a few of these because I had lost my first charger the day I bought the headset.  I purchased 3 of these so I can keep them at work, home and my car.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|Ok you bought this and we all know it was NOT for the story line. The female love interest is just bitchy all the time and quite honestly being bitched at and demeaned and being built like an anorexic surfer is suppose to sway this guy? I understand the appeal of brutal honesty but come on.. just enjoy the view and be honest with yourself as to why you wanted to own this.
B0044XV3R8|3.0|Found it annoying that they split the 3 versions (original, extended, director's cut) into Parts 1 and 2 on 2 separate discs. Spoils the movie experience to have to stop and change discs for the 2nd half of the movie. Why would they do that?
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He loves it.  He says if he could, he'd give it a 6 out of 5 because it is also useful for messing with the dogs!
B004VN39YG|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever, and I loved being able to instantly download it since I don't own it
0425263916|5.0|Everything I expected at a cheap cost., and prime shipping .:) Nothing wrong with that. I cant believe I have a word requirement when honestly what more do you need save. It's better then Fifty Shades. This writer knows how to use a thesaurus. More nicknames then baby.:P
B00BWJARHO|2.0|The movie is good but its more of the same. What really bothers me is that I still had left like 3 hours on my rental when amazon took the movie out. In my playstation 3 said that is was unavailable to playback so I lost 3 hours of rental time and money!!!!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This was such a great book. Thomas and the other are in trouble. Will they get out of the Maze? Read Death Cure to find out.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|An excellent game hours of entertainment. Swim around some awesome scenery eating fish, crabs, stingrays, sharks, and people as you grow into another shark. Worth paying for but glad it was free.
B004PGO25O|4.0|Steven is spot on in his theories about motivation. My favorite thought is to 'just slay your dragon once, then it can never control you again.&#34;<br /><br />This will be a book that I will come back to and continue to pull nuggets of gold from.
B009KEN87O|5.0|great fun game. I could play it for hours.  I like that you can keep retrying a level with fresh lives.  Perfect for the Kindle fire.  kind of retro...like space invaders on steroids.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Best app to download YouTube vids and music! You get can get songs<br />FREE in your music! Get it!!! Awesome
B008JGSM6G|4.0|great game for younger kids to think ahead. My four year old enjoys this game as well as my six year old. Working the puzzle and looking ahead of what you need to do is great for them.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I thought series one was good but this is even better and with series three starting soon it got me back into the mood.  The  places chosen to film in really bring the series alive an absolutely brilliant series.  If I one complaint it would be the changing of scenes from the books, but that is unimportant.  Can't wait for series three to come out on disc.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I have seen Clutch play live more than any other band and this Sunday will be the 15th time. I have been digging on this band ever since I heard the self titled album. This group has never, not once, let me down. Like Faith No More, each and every song and album that Clutch has done has a different feel, yet you still know it is Clutch. Earth Rocker is no different. I am not even going to try and pick a favorite song off of here because it would do an injustice to the rest of the songs on the album. If you like any other Clutch albums, this one will blow you away.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love this type of game; I have not had any problems with it. very entertaining and easy to follow, love the fact that it has a hint button.<br />With the other games I had to download the step by step instructions, very time consuming. can't wait for the next one. Thank you for making a great game.
B00766CLPI|4.0|There are many great musical moments on this album (and the two bonus tracks fo Shubert leider make me think she should do a whole album of nothing but.) There are some not great moments but on the whole it's a very good job and rather brave. Her command of foreign languages is good but I remember when the album came out the reviewers noted that there was a muffled sound, perhaps to help \\"blur\\" her diction. I don't know if it's true or not but all the songs have a dense, muffled audio quality EXCEPT the English language track, I Loved You. Whatever the reason, don't expect a high fi feast.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Having reviewed series 1 and 2 I really cannot find enough words to enlarge on what I have already said.  It is a terrific series and brilliant acting.  What an ending to leave us with - more tears to fall in the next series which I can't wait for.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|if you like bing cosby, you'll love these movies, its nice to sit back and watch a feel-good old time movie especially about christmas, would highly recommend as a family favorite, would also recommend seller to others, wonderful condition
B008ALA6DW|3.0|The way I see it, there are two problems with this adapter, one is Apple's fault, one is not.<br /><br />1. I always seem to have it in my backpack when I don't need it and I never seem to have it in there when I do. This is not Apple's fault, but it's still annoying.<br /><br />2. The Thunderbolt connecter is really a piece of junk. This goes for any Thunderbolt device. When it's plugged in, it doesn't sit nicely in the port, it doesn't click or anything, it just kind of wiggles around. I've had a couple cases where it has just popped out on me. This is annoying as the only time I need the stupid adapter is when there's a problem that I'm trying to solve using it (I'm a network engineer).<br /><br />3 stars because it's so expensive as well. It should be as cheap as the other $10-$15 adapters which contain the same exact NIC. Standard Apple markup, I guess.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|As I am English and my husband American I wasn't sure  he would like it - what a mistake he loved it in fact so much so that we have seen the DVD's twice watched them twice in sequence. Everything about it is wonderful especially the costumes and the acting.  Maggie Smith is absolutely terrific what a superb actress she is.  Having had the fortune to have actually been in Downton Abbey (High Clere Castle) it was even more memorable.

I've tried to implement these principals in the past by intuition, but now I have the underlying framework. It is incredibly relevant to everyone in IT.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have usually gone to the library to read Patricia Cornwell books which I think are the greatest books to read.  I'm an RN so autopies will be of interest to me as well as the investigative science.  On top of that there is murder to solve as well, so it's like being a detective as well.  I think highly of Corwell's book and have read many of her books and I hope she keeps writing more books in the future.  This book was fascinating, scary, and a page turner that I couldn't hardly put down.  Cudo's to you.  Anyone interested in the human body and anatomy of it should read this book and all her books for a thrilling ride.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Nancy

1439153663|3.0|I really liked the beginning of this book. A new twist to a plantation era story. an Irish child taken as a servent when her parents did not survive the ships passage. The characters were interesting and you wanted to learn about them, both slaves and master. From about the middle of the book the story became the same story as many other books about that period of history. The characters did not continue to develop, they just faded. I never felt the young masters story which had great potential ever came out. What caused the things that happened in his childhood to happen. In reality how could the Irish child grow up in that environment with harsh differences and still believe they were all one family. No one seemed to take charge, I felt exactly as another reviewer stated it just seemed to end with everyone running around screaming.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|I have always enjoyed this book, It is basically the story of Jean Valjean and his passage through life. On the way, we have every detail of each person who intersects his path as well as their interrelationships. The book is extremely well written in almost microscopic detail and while some aspects of the plot are a little thin and perhaps just too co-incidental by modern standards, Nothing can detract from the beauty of this particular piece of classic literature.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|Overall, this movie is okay.  It's my lowest rating of the X-Men trilogy.  Hopefully the new movie X-Men:  Days of Future Past will somehow make it better.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|This Seiko is a great watch for a great price. It looks good, is fairly heavy but wears comfortably, and is not too over-sized for my thinner wrists. I haven't had any issues with it losing time as mentioned in other reviews, but then I've barely taken it off since I got it. I've also had no problems with the canvas watchband, which is different and I think looks good.
5551369242|4.0|This collection represents what I understand is the earliest of Mr. King's \\"serious\\" creative output.  By that I mean that point where a young writer begins to really take responsibility for his work and stops making the excuses all of us made to ward off embarrassment if somebody didn't like our work.  \\"I was just screwing around,\\" or \\"I didn't really think it was good,\\"etc., when you weren't at all just screwing around and you most certainly did think it might have been quite good.  If you're like me, you not only craved that outside source approval, you sorta needed a reaction to get the idea where you were -- what you're place was in the journey so far.  You hope to hear \\"you're the new Hemingway!  Better than Hemingway!\\"  But really you know your manuscript needs a ton - a TON! - of work.  And you're just beginning to realize the life of a writer may never be about getting to a place where the process is ever easy.<br /><br />  Apologies for this tangent, but it really does apply.  Because these are books where King would have been taking charge of material.  BTW these are NOT \\"short stories\\" and this is NOT a short story collection.  These are NOVELS and in the case of Running Man, novellas.  King was young when Carrie came out and made him a literary star.  Or at least the publisher wanted MORE MORE MORE.  And he always held a fondness for these early book.  I don't remember exactly why King went with an alternate name.  I believe it was because of pressure to make the stories less raw -- because these novels are absolutely stark, bitter and raw.  King wanted to preserve that feeling while the publisher wanted that more experienced hand that he had become.  Make no mistake, ladies and gents, while this book presents some of the most startling, bleak and hopeless material of his career, Bachman Books are what you might call \\"Juvenilia.\\"  King really hadn't hit his full maturity yet, and that's one of the great things here (something I tried to emulate in my youth when beginning to write, understanding I would only have this perspective once in my life).<br /><br /> To his and the publisher's surprise (only two or three people knew Bachman was actually King, so thorough was the alias and biography for him set up), the Bachman material sold well.  Really well, in fact.  Bachman was in demand -- Running Man became a movie.  Thinner (not included here because it was a BIG hit on its own) took off and rivaled King's own name.  And that suited King just fine because he wanted to write under MORE alias', allow himself to experiment and write as other people, nit ne caged up in this one way of writing.  That is to say working under the SK brand of his own creation.<br /><br />  Regardless of the differences in writing that were so important to Mr. King, people almost immediately began to suspect King was actually Bachman.  Somebody found a royalty check made out to King relating to one of Bachman's books and I believe the guy who found it tried to blackmail King.  Rather than suffer more of the same, King simply outed himself as Bachman  And King wrote of Bachman's unfortunate, untimely death.<br /><br />  BTW the novel in this volume called RAGE is currently out of print.  King says it will NEVER be published again.  Apparently a kid took his class hostage and died after reading RAGE.  For years King denied responsibility.  But it appears the toll of so many years of postal workers going nut, Columbine like shooting, King had enough of this Karmac stain on his soul.  Rather than risk the unlikely possibility his book was contributing to the epidemic, King shelved RAGE.  I believe there was a secondary reason for doing it.  It's not very well written.  I read it while in high school and loved that book.  I read it again in 2009 and sure as shite, RAGE was rather poorly written.  Still compelling, but not the loss from current editions as I feared.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|In January of 2012, I was asked by a friend if I knew of any big budget films that were coming out that year that were not either reboots, prequels, or sequels. In other words, did last year give us any original films, at all? Well yes, but they were pushed aside by all of the superhero flicks, new installments in the Bond and Bourne franchises, an adaptation of The Hunger Games, and the conclusion of The Twilight Saga, a film which was long-awaited by both teen girls and their boyfriends alike. There was only one film that I had seen a trailer for that appeared to be a fresh, new film. Prometheus, the mega sci-fi horror tale from none other than Ridley Scott. However, I was soon informed that this was actually Scott's prequel to his early hit, Alien, which as everyone recognizes now as one of the most popular franchises of the late 1970s and 1980s. I only thought I was excited about this film until I discovered that ABC's \\"Lost\\" producer Damon Lindelof was on board as the screenwriter. And with the entire \\"questions shall be answered and secrets revealed\\" theme of the posters and trailers...well, you can imagine any fan's reaction.<br /><br />However, most of the reactions from audiences were bipolar. Many lauded it for its return to the franchise as well as its revolutionary special effects, while the rest complained that they left the theater with more questions than they had going in, as well as having multiple plot holes and errors. Many people asked after seeing the film, \\"What should we think about Prometheus?\\" and have received many answers. The film takes place in 2093 and follows the actions of two scientists named Shaw and Charlie (Rapace and Marshall-Green) who were hired by a major corporation after discovering multiple wall drawings from ancient civilizations, all depicting humans looking at an unknown constellation of stars. After much research, they found a system of actual planets way off in the boondocks of space that not only precisely matched the constellations found in the drawings, but which were deemed inhabitable for life. So being the sensible human beings that they are, they go on a mission for with a crew hired by their employer, Peter Weyland...who is actually Guy Pearce with a ton of bad make-up on to make him appear two hundred years old. They bring with them crew ready to be turned into alien food, along with Weyland's daughter (Theron) and the robot David (Fassbender). The team finds out that not only did these humanoid aliens, called Engineers, are the creators of the human race, but that the planet that they found was their military base. The Engineers kept stores full of containers that held sperm of a forerunner to the Xenomorphs, the traditional aliens from the Alien franchise. At least that is how it appears. As the film concludes, Shaw finds out that the Engineers had planned to infect Earth with the sperm in order to annihilate the human race, for reasons unknown to them. They find this out, after Charlie gets infected  by the Xeno-sperm and burned alive, two of the crew members get brutally killed by an alien, and Shaw conceives an alien from having sexual intercourse with the Charlie and is forced to perform surgery on herself to get it out. Woah.<br /><br />For obvious reasons, I left the film weak in the knees. Prometheus is not exactly a popcorn flick. However, my first thought was, \\"I wish Avatar had been more like this!\\" Ridley Scott's special effects artists showed some phenomenal work in the design of the planet, along with the Engineers and pre-Xenomorphs. The haunting design of the planet was incredible to have seen in IMAX, with some shots simply breathtaking as well as frightening. For the special effects and production design alone, I believe that Prometheus made up for its mistakes. Of course, I would not be giving the film a fair and balanced review if I did not go through some of these errors.<br /><br />There were three problems that I had with this film. The first wasthe whole presence of Peter Weyland. I felt that his character was completely unnecessary to the overall story, and even if he had to be included for some reason, why did it have to be kept a secret that he was still alive and in cryo-sleep? Would it have made Shaw and Charlie reluctant to go on the expedition with their employer breathing down their backs? Well, of course Weyland gives his reason, that he was days away from death, but wouldn't that be a cool theme to know from the beginning? A summary of the film could then be, \\"A dying CEO who is also a visionary employs a pair of scientists to take him to the planet that the Engineers inhabited in order to meet his makers before he dies.\\" That sounds pretty awesome, if you ask me. And as I mentioned earlier, the make-up artists did a terrible job with turning Guy Pearce into an old man. If you have not seen Prometheus, just think of how bad Saito's aging process was done in Inception. I would say this was even worse. The next problem was more of Ridley Scott trying to make yet another tense scene for his film, and have Shaw and Weyland's daughter run away from the rolling Engineer bomber shuttle. There really isn't anything to say about this, other than it was stupid.<br /><br />The third and final problem I had is not exactly with the film itself, but how so many people criticized it for having the David's plan appear impossible. I know, this sounds really strange, but keep reading. David takes one of the sperm canisters back to the ship (no one sees him do this), and he puts dips some of the substance into Charlie's drink while Charlie is watching him. But one could argue that in the context of the scene that Charlie was depressed and probably more than a little drunk, so I excuse this mistake that skeptics continue to bring up in arguments. However, the rest of his plan does work out, and is even logical in my mind. How did David know that Charlie and Shaw would have sex? Well he said not fifteen minutes later in the film that he knew that they were close, plus during the two year flight he was able to watch their dreams as much as he wanted, so I am sure he learned a thing or two about everyone on the Prometheus by the time they arrived. But how could he have possibly concluded that Shaw would get pregnant? My guess is that he did not, but he did know that all of the canisters in the caves were meant to be used on Earth. He is fluent in over two million forms of communications, remember, so reading the Engineers' writing on the walls wasn't too hard. When Shaw then becomes pregnant with the Alien, David then discovers what the master plan of the Engineers really was: to infect Earth with the alien sperm so the women would conceive the Xenomorphs, who would grow and transform into an army of destruction. The plan is actually ingenious, for as David told Shaw, \\"Sometimes to create, one must first destroy.\\" So in reality, David was not trying to kill off the crew, even though he seemed to want it sometimes, like when he said \\"Don't we all wish for our parents to be dead?\\" He actually is not doing this, rather he was experimenting on the crew to find out to learn more about the Engineers and their motives. However, it is disquieting to know just how dark David really is, because he had to know that bringing the canister on board the ship could possibly harm everyone on board, including Weyland, his \\"father,\\" who was still in cryo-sleep. Michael Fassbender surely brought a lot to the table and added so much to David's character.<br /><br />Prometheus is at its heart, a film about searching for the origin of man, and is a discussion of both philosophy and theology of the hierarchy of creators. The humans created the robots like David, but who created the human race? The Engineers. But were the Engineers created by someone? We shall see. I like Ridley Scott's feel for Prometheus better than that of Alien, although no one can deny that Alien is the better film. With a sequel being planned, Scott would be wise to learn from his mistakes and craft a new film with both the feel of Prometheus and the action and terror that will satisfy the older fans of the series.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this review, I would suggest visiting my blog to read more of my reviews.<br />Go to: [...]hey were close, plus during the two year flight he was able to watch their dreams as much as he wanted, so I am sure he learned a thing or two about everyone on the Prometheus by the time they arrived.

B005LAIGYQ|2.0|2012's Act of Valor attempts to be one of the most patriotic films ever made, but as I watch it again, it seems to become one of the most unworthy films of the year. Hold your horses, I will try to explain.<br /><br />The big draw to this movie during its ad campaign and pre-release state was that it was using real Navy SEALs as its cast, who would be performing real tactics used by this Special Forces branch of the U.S. Military. The audience gets to follow this team of elite soldiers on a mission to rescue a captive CIA field agent who is being held captive by terrorists. We then find out that this group from the middle east has allied with a Russian organization to suicide bomb several public area in the U.S., and the amount of estimated casualties was predicted to surpass the fatalities of the September 11 attacks. The SEAL team then goes on a mission to attack and disarm these bombers at the Mexico border, where they plan to enter the United States. One of the team is killed by a grenade, and the films ends at a funeral, dedicating itself to all the SEALs who have died since the attack on the World Trade Center.<br /><br />This sounds all well and good, right? Apart from being very loyal to their country and having a general attitude of patriotism, these SEALs are shown in many early scenes with their wives and children, spending as much time as they can with them before they leave on their mission. However, the depiction of modern war in the film is the real problem here. I love a good action movie just as well as the next guy, however...is it such a good thing to stylize what those men are doing over their to protect all of us from these all too common acts of terror? And to market it as popcorn entertainment? This film was nominated at the Teen Choice Awards for the \\"Choice Action Movie\\" of 2012. Is that what the Navy SEALs have become, simply a cool subject for an action movie? No, these are real men, who are using real tactics, and reenacting real missions, only this time in front of a camera. These men should be treated with respect, and produce a film that shows one thing: war is hell. Look at the films that have done this accurately in the past. Saving Private Ryan. Black Hawk Down. Letters from Iwo Jima. Films that show the harrowing effects of war to those who witness it, and they literally make your gut wrench at times. The less popular sister film to Letters from Iwo Jima, called Flags of Our Fathers, tells the story of the men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima, and what happened to them after the war. They were called heroes and had their names in the paper, and all because a stray picture of them raising the flag was sent back home. These soldiers didn't even know if they were really the men in the picture because their were two different teams who put up flags in different locations on the day that the United States took the shores of Iwo Jima. That film showed fear in the face of war, and should be commemorated for its realism.<br /><br />Act of Valor looks at all of these films that came before it and gave the teens who watched it a new look at war: nothing less than what one would experience in a Call of Duty video game. In many cases it is all too obvious. There are shots during combat taken from cameras worn on the SEALs helmets that when displayed on the screen look far too similar to a first-person shooter game than real life. Should this be the impression that American teenagers receive about war? Absolutely not. This is where I believe that many critics are spot on when they call Act of Valor nothing more than a two hour long recruiting video for the United States Military. Do I consider myself anti-military? Far from it, I have a passion for defending those who defend our country, and for awhile was seriously considering joining the Army. However, I knew what combat was going to be like, if I was going to be placed in it. Well, not precisely, because no one knows what it is truly like until they experience the horror for themselves. But I had a better understanding of war than a seventeen-year-old who just saw a film like this and decided to join up for God and glory. That is why during high school, war films like the ones I mentioned should be available for students who are interested in becoming soldiers to that they can get a vague idea of the atrocities that will await them if they join.<br /><br />I know what I have written is of a very strong opinion, but it is something that needs to be said more often, especially with a future as uncertain as the one we face now looms overhead. Act of Valor is not entirely a \\"bad\\" film. It shows the men for who they are, fathers and husbands, who also give a great portrayal of the attitude needed of a SEAL...obviously, since that's their job. Honor is a heavy theme in the film, and the knowledge of duty to the mission and of one's country over all else while in the field. The concluding funeral scene is also very touching, ending with the image of the fallen soldier's comrades giving the widow her husband's flag. Patriotism. It is a value that seems to be losing its prominence among Americans today. I suppose the question the audience should ask themselves before watching this film is this: should we expose ourselves to over-glorified military propaganda disguised in the form of an action movie, when so many films before it have given the exact opposite message that it is trying to convey?<br /><br />If you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, I would suggest going to my blog to read my other reviews.<br />Go to: [...]hemselves.

It shows the men for who they are, fathers and husbands, who also give a great portrayal of the attitude needed of a SEAL...obviously, since that's their job. Honor is a heavy theme in the film, and the knowledge of duty to the mission and of one's country over all else while in the field. The concluding funeral scene is also very touching, ending with the image of the fallen soldier's comrades giving the widow her husband's flag. Patriotism. It is a value that seems to be losing its prominence among Americans today. I suppose the question the audience should ask themselves before watching this film is this: should we expose ourselves to over-glorified military propaganda disguised in the form of an action movie, when so many films before it have given the exact opposite message that it is trying to convey?

B005LAII8K|5.0|With Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis leading a talented cast, what could go wrong? Only a little.<br /><br />When I write these reviews, I always try to not only give my opinion, but to give you what everyone else says as well. As is normal with thrillers like Looper, there are people who praised it as the most original movie of 2012. Others complained, saying that it had a silly and unbelievable plot. I would like to remind those who think this that this film is a sci-fi thriller, and by it's very nature is not going to be very realistic. Some people however delved a little further and brought up some good points. One critic said that he enjoyed the film until it detoured from the plot that was being advertised in the trailers. Joe (Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper who after executing all of his target's that the crime lords in the future send him, until they send him his future self (Willis), in an attempt to \\"close his loop.\\" Older Joe escapes from Younger Joe, and later reveals to him that in the future, there is a dictator known as the Rainmaker who is closing all the loops. The Rainmaker is also responsible for killing Older Joe's wife in the future, so Older Joe traveled through time to kill the Rainmaker, who is still only a young boy. This is probably really confusing to those who have not seen the film, so I will sum everything up with this question: what if you had the power to go back in time to killer Adolf Hitler as a young boy? What would you do? A question that has troubled many a philosophy student, but as far as I have seen never has hardly ever been dealt with in a movie before. Anyways, this critic had said that Looper's plot strayed once it got to the use of telekinesis.<br /><br />So on top of the time traveling assassination element, people in the future also have telekinetic powers. Only about ten percent of everyone has them, and even then most of them can only lift small metal objects the size of quarters. And out of these few, even less of them are truly exceptional, like Sid, a young boy who Young Joe finds living out on a farm with is mother, Sara (Emily Blunt). Sid can go as far as lifting up multiple pieces of furniture and imploding gats, the future's hired guns, who come prowling around. Oh yeah, if you fail to close your loop and \\"let him run,\\" you are a wanted man for the rest of your life, which usually turns out to be pretty short once the police are on your back. So while Young Joe is hiding from the police out on Sara's farm, Older Joe is hunting down all of the children who were born on the day that the Rainmaker was born, his only link to finding the future dictator.<br /><br />The film's subtext is a redemptive story for Joe, with both his present and future selves. Older Joe, after he closed his loop, went on to go to China where he worked as a mercenary and fed his hunger for eye-drop drugs, until he met a woman who he falls in love with. She helps him get his life back on track and live as an honest man, and for many years they live in peace until the Rainmaker begins closing all of the loops. And Sara begins to help Young Joe with his drug addiction as he begins to go through withdrawal, and it is obvious that if they had more time together, something more than friendship would show itself. Looper takes a very unique stance on the time travel genre as well. In classic movies like Back to the Future, the characters are all trying not to tamper with the past at all in order so that their futures are not changed when they return to their present. But with Rian Johnson's film, his characters see that by using their knowledge of the future, they can make decisions that will benefit the good of everyone. Young Joe sees this, as he watches his older self prepare to kill Sara, while Sid is running away, safe from danger. He sees that all the events are coming full circle, or looping together, and that it is his responsibility to change this never-ending cycle from continuing. So in the heat of the moment, he shoots himself in the chest, and Older Joe disappears. This allows Sara to survive and Sid to not grow up on a dark and vengeful path.<br /><br />The first time I saw Looper, I was a little disappointed. I did not see the real purpose in Young Joe killing himself. I thought that there would have been other ways for Sid to be taken care of and not go on to become the Rainmaker, without Young Joe having to make the ultimate sacrifice. But that is just it, what is more noble (and redemptive) for the hero to give the ultimate sacrifice for the good of all? This encouraged me to give the film another chance, and when I did I saw so much more in the characters and how the whole idea of sacrifice and redirection of a life was played with from the opening scenes all the way until the final moments of the story. Rian Johnson also decided to uses as little CGI effects as possible, and use wires and practical physical effects whenever it was possible. I applaud him and all other directors who make this choice, because the industry relies so heavily on CGI that many films look like over-stylized cartoons. It is the use of practical effects that gave Looper a gritty, realistic feel. Hollywood needs to make more films like these, that deliver great action spectacles as well as deep and believable characters coupled with great dialog. Johnson's terrific screenplay and direction brought to life this story of redemption and self-giving, while also crafting one of the most original sci-fi films of the decade, albeit having a few errors that I found easy to ignore.<br /><br />If you enjoyed my review or found it helpful, you should check out my blog, where I post movie reviews daily.<br />Go to:[...]t of the moment, he shoots himself in the chest, and Older Joe disappears.

B0081L37Z0|1.0|Glad we didn't purchase.  We &#34;rented&#34; it on a promotional offer and stopped watching it after about 25 minutes - Gag!!!
0307743659|5.0|Possibly King's best book. Definitely right up there with The Green Mile and Misery. What makes it so wonderful is that it has real depth. Don't let the ghosts fool you - this is a story about the hereditary evils of alcoholism and abuse.<br /><br />One thing that came to me when rereading this novel for the first time in YEARS was that I felt I couldn't trust the narrator. Not King - he is technically the storyteller - but I noticed that almost all of the pertinent flashbacks are told from the viewpoint of Jack...and he isn't completely honest with us. Several times he clearly lies to us in his flashbacks. For instance, he adamantly professes to NOT having fixed the debate that so enraged his student, but then a few pages later absently admits to fixing it.<br /><br />So how much more of Jack's story can we trust? I'd argue, not much. I think his abuse of Wendy and Danny was far more pervasive than he claims, I think his hit and run DID involve a fatality, and I believe he intentionally, self-destructively egged his student into a fight. One of the biggest complaints against Kubrick's film is that Jack is insane from the start, but he seemed that way in the book as well. Take into account that his flashbacks may not be completely truthful, and I feel we are dealing with a character who was on the verge of a violent mental breakdown before ever stepping foot in the hotel. And isn't that the ENTIRE point? Ghosts didn't make Jack a monster - he already was one. Don't let the ghosts fool you.

B008S80P38|5.0|It is very difficult to be innovative in Music. It seems there are only 3 chords and the truth, but I believe that &#62;Album Title Goes Here&#60; is remarkable.  I could comment on my response to each song, but my comments about their best expression are best represented by Fn PIG.  I heard this first on their Video from Toronto and it was remarkable there, but the improved variation on the CD is off the charts.  Ravel's Bolero shocked early listeners by it's bold integration of escalated harmonies.  Fn PIG echoes Ravel's masterpiece by creating an expanding digital tapestry.  The song builds with intoxication and the ebbs leading the listener to think that it will be completing, as was the case when played live in Toronto, but the CD's version belligerently continues.  A raucous invitation to just dance right where you are.  The sound is unmistakably Deadmau5 and I am hooked.

B000N2HCM4|5.0|While the man who wrote it eventually became President of the United States, the book has nothing to do with politics. Rather, it is a fascinating and very well written account of how a boy born to a Caucasian mother and an African father figures out his place in a world where race is a very confusing factor. Along the way, you learn about how a community organizer can make a difference even though the process can be frustratingly difficult. You also get an idea of life for people in an African country as it works its way from colonialism to independence. This book is both educational and fine story telling.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is awesome, it is full of surprises. It is just as good as the first, cannot wait for the movie. Hopefully the movie is as great as the book.

B0001XALT6|4.0|This is an interesting character study of cops and how they manage in a small town.  The movie offers a different kind of role for Sylvester Stallone...who deals with corrupt cops.  At the end...justice wins over and the bad cops pay for their corrupt ways.  In addition to Stallone, there is a great cast of actors...who should hold your attention throughout.

B009KEN87O|5.0|Wow, this game really captures the retro feel of galaga and space invaders, but at the same time feels totally unique in its own way. The drag controls are very responsive and easy to learn, and the graphics are so different from anything on the appstore that at first i thought it was some optical trick. The framerate is high, and the transitions between 2D and 3D are very smooth. Worth every star.

It makes you feel like starting your own company is very possible regardless of all the literature and statistics on failure of new start up companies. In summary, I give this book 5 stars because it brought back my motivation to expand my skills and start my own small company!

1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habit is divided into three sections:  individual habits, organizational habits and societal habits. All are worth reading. A  number of chapters are quite fascinating such as the one on Target's methods of identifying customer needs. The author presents a model of a \\"habit loop\\" which explains how habits develop and persist. The loop starts with a cue that leads to a routine that is rewarded.  He also suggests how to change a habit, namely by identifying the routine, experimenting with different rewards, isolating the cue and then having a plan for change.<br /><br />Business professionals will find the book especially useful, but everyone can benefit.

1449325947|5.0|This book only assumes that you know enough HTML, so if you're not yet conversant with even just basic CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), you have nothing to worry about because this is one of the best books around to help you get started.<br /><br />It starts with a quick review of HTML essentials, before moving on to introducing you to basic CSS building block concepts such as what selectors are, how to declare styling rules for them, and how browsers resolve conflicting styling rules.  The discussion then progresses on to more advanced concepts such as using CSS for laying out entire web pages and special techniques for taking varying screen sizes into consideration.<br /><br />Most chapters end with very well thought out tutorials that give you ample opportunities to gain some hands-on experience. The scaffolding files for these tutorials are available for download from the web site mentioned in the book.<br /><br />The author explains things very well and the provided graphics and illustrations are plenty and very helpful. The three chapters on how to use CSS for laying out entire web pages provide some of the most helpful explanations of the challenges involved, and how to deal with them presently, that I have come across in my readings.  There is also ample discussion of what the future holds for various CSS3 module specs, and why instead of a CSS4, we would just be hearing about updates to existing CSS3 modules, or the creation of brand new modules.

0812992784|4.0|I'm not sure why Rushdie didn't immediately (in 1989) take out a (mortal) fatwā on Ayatollah Khomeini--blood money offered for the blood of the true infidel in this matter.  Surely there would have been many takers (for reasons ideological, mercenary, or both).<br /><br />This book is, as many have said, too long.  It is repetitive and wearying, but that is in part the result of the horribly repetitive nature of Rushdie's captivity (and our necessarily being forced to live within his thoughts, which can become quite tiresome).<br /><br />However, this is, in all, an important story of the power of literature and the power of the misguided (who would suppress literature).  It is also a great piece of gossip.<br /><br />It's nice to see the much-maligned Andrew Wylie behaving with such courage and self-sacrifice (he must have bought Rushdie more dinners than any agent has ever bought a client; and have found him more places to live, never mind that they were in the Hamptons; and have made him more money than his books would ever earn out).  Indeed, the book shines a bright though sometimes black light on the world of book publishing and its many (formerly) shining lights--Peter Mayer, Alberto Vitale, Sonny Mehta.  Rushdie is sometimes a bit high-handed in slapping them down for not wanting to risk their lives by publishing him.  But they don't always do themselves very proud in their hemming and hawing and leaving the poor man to wonder if his fated words will ever appear (in paperback, at least).<br /><br />It's always interesting to read the words of a vain man who is left alone with too many mirrors in the house.  But stop blaming him for the use of the third person.  Rushdie was reduced to third-personhood by the fatwā; and what many seem to find insufferable in this book (all the \\"me me me\\") would have been catastrophic if it had actually been that and not the \\"him him him\\" that it is.  Just try reading some pages of the book that would have been called SALMANRUSHDIE and written in the first person.  You'll be grateful that there was indeed, for a time, a Joseph Anton (more a Conrad than a Chekov, though, really, not quite either).<br /><br />\\"A book is a mirror; if an ass peers into it, you cannot expect an apostle to peer out.\\" (Georg Christoph Lichtenberg)

The first time was off their website during the name your price campaign, then I bought the CD (because I only offered $5 when I downloaded the mp3) and now I bought it on vinyl. Yes, it is a great album, and worth the triple purchase to me. What you will notice, right away, is just how warm the vinyl version sounds compared to to the digital versions. This has something to do with the crosstalk inherent to vinyl pressings, and the reduced soundstage. It just sounds more natural to me. And the pressing I got was absolutely superb. Very little surface noise, and not a scratch to be seen (or heard). I'm very pleased with my purchase.

Overall, I thought it was a good story mostly because John Corey is one of my favorite characters (it's his irreverent sense of humor and intelligence).  Too bad Mrs. Corey/Agent Mayfield is such a drip.
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|I've been an audio hobbyist for over 30 years, but started using banana plugs only in the last few years. I love their convenience despite the (basically indiscernible) degradation in audio quality. Anytime you add an additional electrical connection to any circuit you affect the impedance and current flow in a negative way. Ideally we would be soldering these connectors with silver solder to the bare wires, but most folks don't find that worth the trouble or extra expense. On a positive note the thin gold layer (probably plated over brass or copper base metal), provides a better connection that doesn't suffer the oxidation that bare wire eventually does. Of course the bare wire INSIDE the connector will oxidize eventually - that's why the solder connection is the best, it doesn't oxidize because the union isn't exposed directly to air.<br /><br />I've been using Monoprice brand banana plugs almost exclusively up until now. I'm almost positive these Amazon plugs are essentially identical to the Monoprice product. They are also priced about the same at about a buck a piece with shipping. I do prefer the Amazon packaging as the set of 24 comes in a slim, brown cardboard box with 2 plastic trays inside holding the individual connectors - nice touch Amazon! The Monoprice version arrives in small plastic Ziploc bags, each holding a pair.<br /><br />Most of these lower priced connectors unfortunately don't come with any kind of installation instructions. There are YouTube videos and other online resources that show in detail how to use them. In the past I have used the solid body banana plugs that don't have the opening in the side of the connector. The wire only feeds through the bottom of the connector, in comparison to these Open Screw Type, that also allow you to feed the wire through the side and tighten down the screw on it. This can be an advantage if the clearance behind your amp is limited as you don't need as much room to route the wires from the side. Another advantage to this Open Screw Type is you probably get a more secure connection in applications where the wire is fed through the bottom of the connector. This allows you to feed the wire up to the hole and actually pull the end of it out of the hole a bit, then proceed to really crank the screw tight. Use two pairs of pliers, one each on the top and bottom knurling, to tighten the connection up good and secure - but be careful not to strip the threads by over-tightening. Give the wire a pretty good tug after to make sure it is securely connected. It it pulls out, re-do the connection but feed just a little more wire out the side hole before tightening. The solid-body banana connectors described above, are generally inferior because they don't allow you to pull the extra wire out the side hole, so you are in effect getting less wire contact surface.<br /><br />Best practice in the home theater installer world is to put some shrink tubing or electrical tape over the body of the connector after you have finished with the connection. This will keep the positive and negative plugs from accidentally shorting if they are crossed. Use red tape or tubing for the Positive, and black for the Negative connectors, if possible, for the most professional look. Another pro touch is to label each of your speakers wires with a label maker, instead of the usual ugly masking tape and magic marker look!<br /><br />In use I found these AmazonBasics 24k Gold Connector Banana Plugs to provide great sound quality, at least equal to freshly stripped bare wires, or the Monoprice connectors I have past experience with. As with similar bargain priced banana connectors, the weak link is always the banana tip, which, with repeated insertion and removal, eventually compresses on the sides and the connection becomes looser to the point the connector has to be replaced. I deducted 1 star for this important deficiency. Better quality banana plugs are distinguished by being made of an alloy that resists compression and remains \\"springy\\" throughout their lifetime - but you pay many times more for this quality and is unnecessary for most folks who don't move their wires around a lot.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED!s compression and remains \\"springy\\" throughout their lifetime - but you pay many times more for this quality and is unnecessary for most folks who don't move their wires around a lot.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED!

1441737499|3.0|Most of you have probably read this book or seen the cartoon movie. I saw the cartoon when I was a kid and it really turned me off on this book - violent, bloody hares. But I am glad to say that the book is much more civilized - most violence is referred to and not described in detail.<br /><br />There was a little beforeward from Richard Adams where he explained that he started off by telling this story in shorter bits to his daughters during car trips. His daughters eventually demanded he put the tale to paper, which he did. However, he couldn't find an English publisher for it and so the manuscript came to the US, where is was first published. Shortly there after, it made it's way over to England and was a big hit.<br /><br />I enjoyed how the rabbits had their own mythology and stories. There are several segues into these tales and they were instructive and imaginative. While there were few female characters, probably because they came into the story late, they are considered integral in sustaining the new warren.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book so much and I think it's good for all ages. And both boys and girls. It's as romance and an action novel.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My daughter & son in law love this game.  They told me they enjoyed a cool, complicated board game for a change instead to playing video games all the time.
B008XOXGL0|5.0|It is really a coin toss when it comes to buying new music on vinyl these days because of possible bad mastering for vinyl or digital compression before transfer to vinyl. Imagine Dragons \\"Night Visions\\" sounds like it was intended to be on vinyl.<br /><br />I look forward to future albums from Imagine Dragons.

0385349947|4.0|This groundbreaking book essentially recommends that women who aspire to leadership work their entire pregnancy, take a short maternity leave (and work throughout it) and then return full time, as Ms. Sandberg did. Furthermore, they should expect to not be around much for their young children, as she writes she \\"missed doctors' appointments and parent teacher conferences and traveled while her kids were sick\\". She also talks about her 11-month old son reaching out for the nanny instead of her when he hurts himself. This is the cold reality of a female COO, and I applaud Ms. Sandberg for her honesty.<br /><br />However, what does this cold reality mean for children, particularly if a generation of mothers aspire to follow in Ms. Sandberg's lead? The cost of her ambition was that she put her kids at risk, and deprived her infant son of a bond with his mother at the most critical stage during his development.<br /><br />So what? What will the next generation of children look like if they are all raised by Sandberg-like women? We don't know, but it's the next step in the conversation. Ms. Sandberg states research about how \\"children who were cared for exclusively by their mothers did not develop differently than those who were also cared for by others.\\"  Maybe.  But I think she's seriously glossing over real problems here. Can't stress during pregnancy  cause problems in the embryo? Don't infants need their mother's full focus and attention to develop emotionally? Don't infants need trusted, regular physical contact? Look around our society and see obvious reasons to be concerned: Children are suffering from higher than ever rates of autism, obesity, ADD and anxiety and pill addiction.  There are many reasons for this, of course, but having parents who spend less than an hour a day with their kids can not just be \\"ok\\". I'm sure Ms. Sandberg hired one-on-one nannies and trained cooks. Many parents will not have those resources. Women \\"leaning in\\" to be principal at a school, or head of a non-profit or elsewhere may work long hours and still earn less than $75k.<br /><br /> I must also say: I loved this book. I loved what this book said about seeing latent sexism and how it undermines women, and how so many women feel ashamed of their pregnancies and feel they have to drop out of work rather than make any demands. I have daughters, and I'm so excited at how this book can change their professional futures. It's an incredible, powerful book, that will change our work world forever. And it's about time.<br /><br />So it is a book filled with contradictions and unaddressed issues. That's ok. Please read it anyway.  Ms. Sandberg has started the conversation.  We are all fumbling around in new territory here as women pour into the work-world and technology changes our old work schedules. We are figuring it out.<br /><br />We need a sequel, telling us how to do this right. The truth is, we don't know exactly what children really need and at what ages. But before legions of new moms inspired to lean in go down the Sandberg path, lets think through the consequences for children. If it is possible to be a working mom and a good mother, it is tricky-- and most women don't know how to do it.  We need more literature for working moms that teach how to stay connected with their kids, how to give them what they need and how to ensure they grow up emotionally stable and loved-- even when they only see their mothers an hour a day. Maybe less.<br /><br />We are at the beginning of working out this issue, and it is a good thing that people are talking about it-- as long as we also keep in the front of our discussion the needs of children.

B0058RCVYS|5.0|Wonderful and moving story.  Most of the acting is superb and the characters are interesting and warm and oh so human.  I hope you watch this movie and enjoy it as much as I.  Highly recommended.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I got it because it was free of charge and I really enjoyed reading it, it was hard to put it down. It was one of those books that really pull you in and you can imagine every detail and cheer for the couple.... great read if you enjoy romace
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Definitely worth watching, with great acting and story telling, George R.R. Martin's books come alive to present us with an awesome show.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|It's about a chubs-alicious girl and her Korean (right?) paramour - what's not to love? No really - this story definitely has heart and so many emotions fit onto so few pages. I finished it in a day and a half...
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Where was I when it aired? Glad to be able to view it now. Plan to do a marathon to catch up.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|If you think that Macklemore is just about Thrift Shop, you must check this album out. Such thoughtful, profound lyrics about real life issues that we can all relate to.
1426209584|5.0|Beautiful book with outstanding pictures. Any body who loves bisrd would really enjoy it. I can't image how much time - in years - it took to get all of the pictures and the information. .
B000FC130E|5.0|Anything written by Neil is pure gold and should be required reading by most adolescent adults today. Are they adolescent adults or just adolescents?
B003VANOFY|4.0|I have had these headphones now for two years, and to this day I still continue to use them!<br /><br />I am going to keep this short. These headphones function perfectly for what I use them for. I can be in bed and watch Netflix with this on, and while doing so, I can raise and lower the volume. If I am using a media player, I can use the side buttons to pause, fast forward, and rewind what I am viewing.<br /><br />The microphone is great quality, and using it for gaming is completely do-able. Everyone understands me, there is no static, no breath caught over it, and when I am not using it, I can fold it up and out of the way where it automatically mutes.<br /><br />The ear pads are what knocks a star of this set. They are a bit hard, and seal too well making hearing myself muffled. If I game, I usually only use one earphone and tilt the other side off my ear. Otherwise it is great if your watching a movie to have noise cancelling.<br /><br />Battery life after two years is still in the 6 to 8 hour range. These do not get too heavy on your head either.<br /><br />I would most certainly purchase another set of these if for some reason my current set failed, I however would look to see if there is an upgrade to the ear pads, perhaps a cloth set rather than the typical leather like type.

B007N31ZLA|5.0|Before there was Ocean 11 and Ocean 12 there was The Sting.  This is one of the finest examples of a con artist movie ever done.  Plus it stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford.  Great stars.  Plus a plethora of actors in an ensemble cast.

0307888908|5.0|This book shows how individual professionals can thrive in today's competitive world by applying the best practices of some of the world's most successful start-ups to their careers.  These ideas have had a huge impact on me. I learned how to launch career plans amid uncertainty (even though I hopefully won't have to do so anytime soon!), how to generate breakout opportunities, how to take intelligent risks, and how to build an effective professional network.  PLEASE READ THIS FANTASTIC BOOK!
B005D0RDIE|5.0|The performace is incredible. The camera angles are very good and do not jump around as on music videos so enjoyable to watch.

B0058YPILY|5.0|Love this TV series.  I don't have a 9-5 job so I don't get to catch it every wednesday.  But I purchase these DVDs for a great price from amazon.com and catch up.  Also buy the seasons in bulk and save even more.  I did that with Seasons 1-4.  Awesome Deals on here and Awesome Series!!
B004CLYKLI|2.0|I just could not agree with this woman's method for bringing up children.  I did not like her either.  I hope to see a book about her from her 2 girls some day.  We had a long discussion at my book group though.  That is a good thing.
B009KEN87O|4.0|I can't wait for improved graphics on future versions. Galaga and Space Invaders all rolled into one. Shoutout to a job well done.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Absolutely wonderful.  The acting was superb and it was historically correct.  If history had been made this interesting in school, I would have been more attentive.  Would recommend to everyone.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|One of the most intriguing and adult series seen on TV in what seems like forever. Great series for anyone who is a fan of Medieval style fantasies.

B0036BK6MW|5.0|Love football and I am a Ravens fan.  Bias aside, the acting is excellent and they tell a story of love beyond themselves.<br />Would recommend to anyone, because it shows how support from others and faith in yourself can help you achieve what seems unreachable.

B00B1E6FF8|1.0|If I want to watch a digital copy of my movie on a computer, it is when I'm on the road on business or for vacation. That means Internet probably is not available for streaming. If I am at home, I'm going to watch the DVD or Blu-Ray and don't need Ultraviolet. Any movie that only has Ultraviolet and not a copy I can load onto a computer and watch at 20,000 feet, is going to get a one-star rating from me. (Besides, Ultraviolet is a pain to use.)<br /><br />If a motion picture company wants to sell me a DVD or Blu-Ray without Ultraviolet and charge $2 less, I\\"ll take the deal. But don't advertise Ultraviolet as a digital copy, because it is not. If all I wanted to do is stream the movie at home, all I'd have to do is rent it from the cable box or wait until it streamed on one of the other pay services.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I had heard the last selection on CSI NY and loved it so I ordered it.<br />It takes me 5 listening to decide if I like a CD.  I like most of the selections, but am not thrilled with the foreign language selections.  However, they do not distract from the rest of the CD.  Josh Groban is a favorite artist of mine, so I am always willing to take a chance on anything he does.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved the story. There are so many sad true stories that relate to this story. I can't wait to see the movie
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|really nice graphics and animation. kind of a multitasking activity.  Fun and challenging.  not bad for free. I think the instructions could be a little clearer for some of the tasks.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We enjoy the integration of historical information into the drama series. The characters are well developed and certainly play off each other.<br />I appreciate that at least what we have watched so far (Season 1 and a few episodes of Season 2), it is wholesome. There is no killing, sex, violance or vulgar language. A breath of fresh air!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Beware you have some time to read because you will not be able to put this down.  The characters are many and finely drawn, the story unusual and gets more intriging as time goes on.  There are many surprises and twists.  Pay careful attention to all of them.  You won't be able to say &#34; the butler did it&#34; until the very end.  Super book!!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I may not be the biggest audiophile out there, but I love my music. This coupled with Sennheisers is a very nice combo, and really boosts both the volume and quality of your music!

B006VFLIYK|5.0|All Baldacci books are enjoyable, some more than others, but this one is at the top of the list.  Every chapter, every page made you want to keep reading and seeing what is just around the next corner.  Very enjoyable!
B00000F214|5.0|It was a movie I liked a lot before, being a Kevin Spacey fan and slowly buying things on Blu-ray. Can't afford to have 3 different types of technology, but the days of VHS are long gone and DVD is good but not like Blu-ray.. The clarity of Blu-ray and Surround Sound make home entertainment lots better than the past. I liked this move and would recommend it. Whenever you find a deal on Blu-ray, snag it. They are few and far between!
B009KEN87O|5.0|A fun classic game to kill some time with. Good to entertain oneself our lend to three kids to play with.
B0082Z447U|5.0|First heard this when I was a kid on the BBC and I have loved it ever since. To me this is one of Collins very best.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow. I don't even know where to begin. I began this book thinking it was just another teenage love story...never have I been so wrong. Holder is wise beyond his years, and says all the right things. I went through a strikingly similar situation as Sky (Hope), and Holder's words to Sky helped me, too. This novel had so many levels; so many twists, and all of them incredible. This is now my new favorite book. It's so REAL, and I thank Colleen for that. Please do not hesitate- read &#34;Hopeless&#34; immediately! You'll be forever changed.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|This was a touching story of love and the power of true grace. Love always wins. Jodi Picoult delivers another page turner which like all of her books takes several surprising twists along the way.
B00280LYHS|5.0|One of the Best book I every read action packed with all my favorite characters every body has to read this book
B0062YADWI|5.0|the hexagram-shape socket works great on bolt heads with similar shape, very handy. The bottle opener is easy to use. Plus you can also use it to carry your keyring perfectly!
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|It came fast, the music is good. Not much else to say really. If you are buying this you know what you are getting.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Justin is at it again. I appreciate that this album is a different feel than his other albums. It may not have been what you were expecting, but the album is still great once you take the chance to really sit down and listen to it.
B004UID2LC|2.0|This app is SUPER good. But almost all of the time , the app won't even open. But when (and if it ever does again) it can be the best YouTube app ever!
0307743659|5.0|After I read Stephen King's book, On Writing, I found myself wanting to read one of his novels. The list of books he has written is impressive and picking which one to read first was going to be a tough decision. I have seen many movies based on his books and found most of the movies enjoyable and entertaining. Though, thinking back there was one movie that was head and shoulders above the rest, The Shining. I saw The Shining in the early eighties with a couple of friends and we all were captivated and through the years parts of that movie has stuck with all of us. Using the logic that the book is always better than the movie, my choice was made.<br /><br />The Shining is about a remote hotel (The Overlook) and a man who was hired to be the caretaker for the winter, and his family. The family consists of the father, Jack, the mother Wendy, and their son Danny. Danny is only five but he shines, meaning he has an ESP ability. The Overlook Hotel wants the power that Danny has and will stop at nothing to get it.<br /><br />The Overlook Hotel is as much of a character in the story as anyone else. The three main human characters all have an internal conflict raging inside them. The father, Jack, is a recovering alcoholic and really needs this job, the mother Wendy has issues with her own mother and Danny knows that the Overlook is a bad place but thinks it will help his daddy. The Overlook knows that once the snow falls they will trapped and there will be no escaping.<br /><br />There are more than a few places in this book that will have you turning on the lights, sitting on the edge of your seat, and holding your breathe. I am not much of a horror fan, in books or movies, except during the holidays season (Thanksgiving through New Year's). However, Stephen Kings use of language and his ability to create both emotional and physical intensity has made me a fan. Though, I think it will be necessary to read more of his books before claiming to be a true \\"hardcore\\" King fan.<br /><br />Highly recommend, one of the scariest, most intense books I have read.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Got this because I am a Gideon and this is what they are going to in place of NKJ.  Like it very much - it is on my smart phone and tablet.<br /><br />Gideon K
B005ZUR724|5.0|Absolutely perfect! If you love WoW or runescape, take it on the go with this awesome game! Quests, full customization, an awesome MMORPG!
B00A4YZWN2|4.0|I did want more of an explanation for what happens to a few of the characters at the end. And it does end with the characters ending up completely different and they do end up going down paths you didn't expect (which is probably why so many reviewers are saying it felt like a completely different story written by a different author).<br />But I don't see why everyone has such a big problem with the conclusion, because I thought she wrapped up the message of the story just fine.<br />So I think she does get to the point, she just doesn't leave you with enough on the characters.<br />I would love to see another book on how the characters live after this. :)
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is a good S King book if you are looking for a long book to keep you occupied more than a couple of days.  No aliens in this one!  Interesting take on the Kennedy assasination for someone born back in the 60s to read.

B006LRUVUA|5.0|If you are looking for remote control software to control your home computer from anywhere then I would highly recommend TeamViewer.

B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I was hoping Prometheus would be a great new SiFi movie, and 3D ta boot!  This was just a blood lust filled, totally predictable horror flick.  The beginning was amazing, but the movie neve explained the beginning.  And the end, with the little Alien monster sticking its head up and the scientist flying off to find the REAL home of the aliens, was a crase setup for a sequel.  That a great director could do this shows how easily tallent is perverted by money.  If you want to read a real story about alien involvement in human evolution, read Childhood's End by A. C. Clark.  He wrote 2001 the movie with Kubrick and wrote the book after the movie.  It explains 2001, but Childhood's end is a much broader and spectacular story.

1476733953|5.0|I found Wool over at Goodreads.  One of the folks I'm following(Damali) of whom's reading interest I respect, recommended this book.[...]  This series intrigued me from the moment that I realized that Holston was going \\"up\\" to die.  Wow.  I was there in that Silo with those people.  That close yet so far away \\"community\\" of people. I was dizzy from the trips taken up and down the silo stairs.  I absolutely couldn't imagine the job of a Porter. The down deep was hot and steamy and gritty in my imagination.  Everyday living was well thought out and planned and I wanted to know who did it.  I wanted to know how and why from the onset.  Mr. Howey weaved a tell that keep me downloading each sequel all weekend!  I couldn't believe they were only 99 cents!    I'm pretty new to the sci-fi genre. I've always loved a good dystopian story thrown in my mix now and again.  But I didn't realize all the goodies that were out there!  I had been a thriller, suspense kind of gal not realizing my love for engineering and technology could make for wonderful fantastic stories!  I've always been a pretty slow reader. Preferring to savor each paragraph and meditate on the plot possibilities and such.  I've never understood how people could say they read a book in one or two hours or even one day, but that actually happened to me!    Thanks for hooking this fish Mr. Howey!

B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is awesome but leaves you in suspense. I enjoyed reading it and couldn't put it down toward the end.  I gave it 4 stars because the beginning was a little boring.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|the one starts are complaining about the video not loading  when they rented it online for streaming. thats why you buy hard copies. Great movie, saw it in theaters 4 times
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Love everything except Blue Ocean Floor, definitely nice to have something from Justin Timberlake again. Wish there were more songs, though.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|First everything on the vender's part was great. I preordered, was notified when available, and received it ahead of schedule. It rated 3 stars because it was a good movie but just to strange for someone like me.
B006UG90RM|3.0|Having been a long time fan of VH for many years, I was looking forward to seeing Dave and Eddie reunite with something new.  1984 was one of my favorite albums and I was hoping for more of the same, but without the complete lineup and the way they seemed to record this, I was a bit disappointed.  All the music sounds like it was recorded on a bad track machine from the 70's and whether this was intentional or not, it muddles the sound and makes it less crisp than I am use to hearing from VH.  The songs themselves are ok but after all this time waiting for something new, I expected a bit more than what I got from this album.  I will say it is an ok effort, but I definitely had higher expectations.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|Brings back memories.  The concept was quite unique in its day. I remember how \\"uncomfortable\\" I felt during the first showdown in the saloon. I don't believe I could have pulled the trigger and waxed Yule Brynner- regardless of his being a machine. This was the real terror of WESTWORLD! I also remember how Yul Brynner would just \\"fill up the screen\\" in any scene in any movie he was in. Great screen presence!
B005K17RU0|2.0|This app is good for current conditions only. Accuweather does not know how to forecast. A day before the Blizzard of 13, it said 2 to 4 inches of snow for me in Southern Maine. For the record, we got 36&quot;. Need I say more?

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I loved this book. It is a retelling of Cinderella with a futuristic sci-fi twist. Meyer does an excellent job of creating atmosphere.<br />The world is described in a way that you get a clear picture of the world Cinder lives in. I also liked how their was history mentioned during the story so you could get a better idea of the world and the events leading to the present.<br />The story was really entertaining and did a great now of incorporating the Cinderella story into the main plot.<br />The characters were also well done. Cinder, especially, is someone you can't help liking and rooting for. I also liked Kai. Levanna and Adri are great antagonists. I also enjoyed the other minor characters and felt that the added more depth to the world.<br />I definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes ya and is looking for something a little different.

Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon who strongly didn't believe in such thing until he was 7 days in a coma and had the most profound experience. It's a very good read and everybody should read it.
1476734941|5.0|This is an excellent book. So simple, motivating and factual. Best of all The FastDiet actually works! I had lost 52# on my own over the last 16 months simply by eating the way I know I should. After a while, the weight loss slowed and stopped. I needed something that would help me to continue to lose wt without depriving me. This is the ticket! I am so very pleased!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I am addicted addicted addicted and as Meyer has said, would love to live in this world.  I have downloaded the next book and am eager to see the movie!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck-it Ralph was a great movie for kids and adults!! I watched it with my boyfriend and we both laughed the whole time. Loved it!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I am not old enough to remember the original game but love this! its my new favorite game<br />joseph age 13 FL
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Could not put it down! Excellent. Wish had read sooner! Wow. Really moving. Highly recommend! Very well written and captured your full attention.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|kept me  busy trying to match squares  I play this on my kindle,  helps  an old lady's brain to keep working
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|I would recommend Amazon On Demand to everyone I know and will continue to use it to what family and personal movies
1423136802|5.0|This is a great box set with classic artwork on the covers. I recommend it to anyone young or old
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down! And free with the lending library. I'm glad there is really good books in it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Start with a healthy dose of Space Invaders; add one part Galaxian, 1tsp of Megamania, a dash of Asteroids, and update the whole thing without losing the retro feel...<br /><br />You'll end up with a lot of time wasting fun.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Got this book on our Kindle HD for my husband & he loves it. He has read it twice already!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found myself reading into the wee hours every night. This book keeps you entertained and wondering what the next twist will be. My first time reading this author and I'm happy I decided to.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I just really love this book it is amazing and one of the best books I've ever read I recommend this book too anyone that doesn't mind sexual things.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie was great!  It really brings you back to a time that we should all be ashamed of.  I can't believe people were treated like that.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This has one of the best apps that I have purchased for my 3 year old. She loves the games & with just a little instruction the first time, she now has it all figured out & can play on her own. Holds her interest for quite a while.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is a must read and I can't wait until the next book is due out.  I have already recommended the two books to several  of my friends and especially one has already read both books and agree with my opinion of these books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love Nicholas Sparks! Yet another winner! And ordering was easy & immediate from Amazon! And I even had a past credit I had forgotten about! Thank you Amazon
B005IQZB14|5.0|I listened to this book on my way to and from work in the car, it was a great read! It was really inspiring to hear a story of a  young women doing such a big journey and over coming fears and her past. I can honestly say it makes me want to go on a long back packing trip!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|For some reason the Blu Ray of this 50 song compilation is not sold on Amazon yet. I bought it for $20.19 and paid $2.00 shipping on another site. I had most of these songs so the only reason why I would consider buying it would be for improved sound. The Blu Ray is one disc (as opposed to 3 cds). The Blu Ray has 3 different ways to play it in stereo PCM, DOLBY TRUE HD and DTS MASTER AUDIO. They are 24 bit. The sound is very good and definitely better than the cds I have. I have Beggars Banquet on SACD. There are two Beggars Banquet songs on GRRR. We compared the other night and my wife and I both thought that the 24 bit  Blu Ray sounded better than the SACD. The SACD sounded more muddled. So far I think I got a good buy, improved sound on great Rolling Stones songs.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game was really fun. I had fun using the casual mode, but I had so muchfun that I plan on playing it again in the other mode. There are tons of hidden object games and several puzzles. It's so fun that I would recommend it to everyone. I really felt it was worth the money I spent. I have really enjoyed every Big Fish game I have played and I plan on getting more!!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love this case.  I just wanted something simple and lightweight to protect my Kindle from my preschooler's antics, and this fits the bill well.  I love that it clicks in securely (my son can't get it out of the case) and it has a nice feeling and weight in my hands.  I like being able to bend back the cover all the way to sit and read.  The kickstand works fine...it's not the best feature of the case, but we don't use it much.  I really like the sturdy elastic band to keep the cover closed.  I tried a different cover first and sent it back because it didn't fit the Kindle securely or stay closed, but this one works great!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I wanted more at the end! It was heart breaking at the end of the story, but I couldn't put it down. I couldn't wait to see what happened next, it reminds me of those early stages in a relationship where nothing else matters but the other person. Brought me back to my younger years.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|one of the most beautifully filmed and heartfelt shows to come along in awhile. we were looking for something to watch while waiting for next season of downton abbey  [also one of our favorites], and lark rise to candleford was a wonderful surprise! the scenery is breathtaking with great stories and memorable characters. Finally tv worth watching!
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I was not impressed with this game.  I felt that there should have bee more directions on how to play.and that a lot was left to be figured out on your own. Maybe because I am not familiar with this game. I would not recommend this to anyone who has not played it before.
0307592731|5.0|I almost did not read past the first 2 chapters because I found them so depressing. However, I stayed with it and laughed, cried, and said &#34;Oh,no&#34; so many times.I purchased the book because my neighbor (even older than I) has worked at some of the places where Cheryl stayed on her odyssey and has hiked parts of the trail. I thought she would enjoy reading the book, but she was way ahead and had already read it. She showed me pictures of the trail and it made the book even more interesting than ever.
B009KEN87O|5.0|It is so much like space invaders with tons of bullets spraying and it just has so many surprises in store for you. It has many different enemies. My favorite part is invincibility not because it makes you invincible but because it adds a little first person shooter too the game. I don't know why it does that though. It is a perfect game for a person who has the time to play if like if you're on the go and are on a plane or something. The main point of the game is to stay alive and kill the enemies quickly. It has a bit of every thing you want from a game except graphics. Lol. It is  a great game. It's worth the time.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the Mitch Rapp series, and they are all near the top of my &#34;favorite books to read&#34;. Mitch's &#34;No non-sense&#34; attitude is what kind of hero Americans want protecting our freedoms. Vince Flynn's action-packed writing style ideal for readers who don't care for excessive/I eventful dialogue in other books. He's probably my favorite author! I suggest starting at the beginning of the Mitch Rapp series and read them all straight-through.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story touches your heart in many ways. From them battling cancer, to falling in love every moment touches you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|im gonna keep it short<br />the hunger games series is amazingly well written and very<br />suspenseful<br />i am a hunger games dork<br />go hunger games!!!!!!!!!!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|fun game to play. takes some concentration and planning to win each level.  nice feature that you can redo a level immediately to get a better score.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I loved the first three books, but four and five are basically 2000 pages of nothing.  It is clear that Martin is milking the story and has absically abandonded anything resembling a plot now that he can start collecting HBO royalities and stretch this out as long as possible.  The books read like a soap opera and moves just about as fast.  To be honest there are about 400 pages of intersting, well written, story telling embedded in the almost 2000 pages of books four and five.  Good luck finding them.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|What can I say other than they put out one hell of an album for die hard Clutch fans you won't be disappointed!
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Ever wonder what would happen if you had taken the road less traveled? If the world one day discovered you in your miserable job and elevated you to star status - except that in this case nobody told you? Great music, great story.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|When I first heard of this show I figured it was going to be dumb and boring.  I am glad I was wrong. This show has lots of action and some drama.  There is always something going down with this club. Looking forward to watching the rest of the series.
B0014JKJJI|1.0|I ordered these shoes on the glowing recommendation of my coworkers in the kitchen where I am employed. I wanted a pair of comfortable shoes that could get water or food on them without becoming damaged. These seemed to fit the bill. I wore them three times to work last week and was incredibly pleased with them. They were easy to clean and my feet felt good even after my long shifts. However, when I went to put them on for work today I couldn't even get them on my feet because they had shrunk!...Dramatically! What an enormous disappointment. The right shoe appears to have shrunk maybe three whole sizes and the right shoe perhaps two--they are two different sizes now and neither of them fit my feet. I'm very upset. I wore them THREE TIMES to work, nothing more. I didn't put them in the dryer or anything weird like that--I wore them to work and took them off and let them dry naturally. There is no explanation for this, and it is enormously disappointing. They are clearly defective. I would like a replacement or a refund.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I usually don't like crime based stories, but  this was fantastic. Especially being a parent, no one wants to think their own child is ever guilty. I could hardly put it down.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Excellent songs especially that these songs are written and composed for a weekly TV series. I recommend this to all country western fans.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|I wish I would've been able to try this app out before I purchased it. I am less than impressed with this app. it doesn't do anything great and really isn't what I was hoping it would be. I have to write most notes in cursive and I cant ever dot the I or cross my t's without any problems.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I fell in love with the 1st book and in this one it was more of a love hate kinda thing. You get worked up at some of the discussions the characters make, I found my self practically yelling at the book. Yet I still absolutely LOVED this book!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use my phone as an alarm clock in hotels, at home, and pretty much everywhere. I bought the better version to avoid ads, and I haven't been disappointed. Interface for setting alarms is easy and intuitive, snooze works great, no problems at all.
0142407542|4.0|not quite as original as the first gruffalo but still a must have for all fans of julia donaldson. not sure about the bbc movie though...
B008OOYALE|4.0|like it . but wish my wall was not so hard to get to also its really slow to load
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Brilliance on every level. Every claim is backed. Every discovery explained in the context of the discoveries it was predicated by. Pure genius, yet accessible to most.
B008MM9630|4.0|This game is fun for our whole family. Even my 6 1/2 year old daughter can play it and she enjoys it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Took me 2 weeks to get past the first twent pages, but once I did I finished it in a day.
B009KEN87O|5.0|When I was reading the description about this game I thought it sounded pretty lame. However, it had 5 stars so I decided to give it a try. What a really cool game.  The game play is outstanding and the graphics are even better than that. Definitely worth the price... Free!!!
B00A4TKDKY|4.0|I bought this album after I saw him live in 2012, and is a great example of his show at that time, although recorded in 2010. Any way you slice it,  Buddty is truly a legend.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Story is entertaining, but this book unfortunately has no literary merit. Writing style is poor and there is a lot of redundancy in ideas and phrases. The writing style overall is very cheesy and forced. With that said, if you want a no-brainer entertaining book and you don't mind killing a few braincells, this is a nice read.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The SwiftKey keyboard (paid version) is a serious upgrade to the stock keyboard that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3. The keyboard has great features like a number keypad and an almost psychic predictive text! The 'swype' feature is surprisingly accurate, though I  must admit I don't use it as often as the standard typing mode. All in all, the $4 I spent on this app is a bargain compared with the productivity and accuracy I've gained from using SwiftKey. 5 out of 5 stars.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Quite possibly the best book I have ever read. So many great passages get ready to use the highlight feature.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|ever watch a trailer and wonder if all the funny bits could fit in such a tiny window...well dis movie's funny bits hardly fill up a trailer.  and thats $4 that i will never get back
B0011Z77OK|5.0|RHCP is one of my favorite bands. This collection is some of the best songs they ever made. Love it!
B007SO31BQ|5.0|Great film depicting a great sport and a great sportsman. Senna was an incredible driver and his demise was a great loss to F1
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi is simply stunning! At first  I only wanted to read it because of the upcoming movie. What I found was an amazing, touching story of Pi & Richard Parker! It's a story that really makes you believe in God. Simply amazing!
1433502410|5.0|Very big Bible to lug around, but I think it is worth it. Lots of notes and helpful information, such as frequent maps every few pages, chapter explanations, archealogical information, cultural information, and footnotes explaining the original Greek language. Really packed full of knowledge.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary gives you a very good overview of how the food industry works and how horribly it treats animals. We worry so much about &#34;animal cruelty&#34; but do nothing about the millions of animals being tortured everyday, except eat them!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I could not put this book down.  From the very beginning I needed to know what was next for Pat Peoples.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome collected all 100 eggs and have 95,000 coins for Reborto.<br />If you are looking a game better than temple run here it is.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|It also destroys lives. We all want cheap energy, cheap natural gas, and energy independence, but at what cost? Destorying the environment, and people land and lives?
B003F3PMYI|3.0|I agree with the overall view but implementing would be difficult.  To be taken in small doses.  Did provide a few good laughs
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very fun to play on free time. It is very addicting to play. It stinks when the prizes fall of the side.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|As an 80's teen, I grew up singing these anthems and ballads.<br />There really needed to be a musical, to capture the time and<br />place that was the hair metal scene.<br /><br />Smartly, they play snippets, and blend songs together, so dozens<br />of songs are covered, and the pace moves along quickly.<br /><br />Very funny, great jokes all thru the film.<br /><br />The secret surprise of the film, of course, is Tom Cruise nailing<br />an Axl Rose, eccentric type of rocker.<br /><br />This is one of those heartwarming, crowdpleasing films that will<br />run on cable for years. Great for parties, nostalgia, or showing<br />the new generation how it's done, with style and lyrical craft.<br /><br />The world can be a rough place, and you see it in patches all thru<br />this film, but love, hope and belief win the day. What's wrong<br />with a film that makes you feel great? Not a damn thing...<br /><br />Never mind the bollocks (negative reviews) and damn the torpedoes!!<br /><br />Rock out with Rock of Ages!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Thus game expands and evolved the top down space invader game to an entirely new and fun experience.  Love it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game, love it, cant stop playing, works great on my kindle.  never played a game like this before, would love to find more of this game.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Good game, fun way to pass the time. Pretty easy but I enjoy playing it. Kids will enjoy playing it too.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I first read this as a adolescent in the 1970 - still as good as I remember.  One of the first stories (along with The City and the Stars) that first turned me on to Clarke.
B005G6QF8Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums out of a collection that spans terabytes! She is extremely talented and there really isn't a song on here I feel isn't orchestrated perfectly and is ultimately infectious. Can't wait for more material from this great artist!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is very well done, if you've ever played the old arcade games you will love this one. Simple, yet difficult. The response is very smooth and accurate to what you are telling it to do. The only bad thing I can say about this is that its very addicting, I can see a lot of hours gone on this game! But hey, at least now I'm not spending a fortune in quarters for those hours.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think this book teaches kids that not everything is going to be the perfect day. I loved this book
B006LSZECO|2.0|I started reading Gone Girl but I could not get into it.  This happens occassionally.  I did not finish reading the this book.
B000025Y9I|5.0|this is my second copy, misplaced the first. now it's on my MP3. very good lyrics and music. my favorite
0062068415|5.0|Shutter Island. I read the book then saw the movie 5 times. In the meantime I lost my copy so I reordered it from Amazon.<br />The picture follows the book almost exactly which was refreshing. Dicaprio and the whole cast were fantastic. This book will become a classic in its genre.
B000FBFMIO|4.0|I have enjoyed all of my Reading of the Farseer line. Fools errand picks up where Assassins quest left off. I am quite glad for that.  On to the next book!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|a very believable timely novel. Always nice to hear about Ryan and his set of characters. This is a must read
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The numbers a hard to read.. I'm older and I hate to put my glassed on to tell the time..For some reason, The Min's past the hr. is the largest numbers.. Keeps good time and self winding..Now that I think of it the slower I get,I don't know witch will stop first for lack of moving...Tom,,from,, Florida
B009KEN87O|5.0|Once in a while you get a wow....this is so fun! Love the way you auto shoot...and can start out easy..
B00A7H2NC4|5.0|This book is just like the movie sin city. There are a few differences needed to keep up with the series. Even though its just like the movie its still great!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Like the Holy Bible app<br />I use it in church every Sunday<br />I really like the multiple versions of Bible it has and most importantly you select it to read to you on those nights that your tired.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is so much fun, I play all the time. So far pretty easy &amp; simple to play.  It kees you interested. I love the 3d effects. Its like mah jong, but to me a lot more fun.  Twist &amp; turn the cube to find matches. Beat your own time, or the games.  I highly recommend it. If ya have 2 minutes or 2 hours to play, its a great time waster.
7500117124|4.0|No where in the discription did it say that it was a bilingual book. Luckily there was the original English written along with the Japanese. I didn't mind the other language. I just wish it had be clearly marked on the description page so I would know what I was purchasing.
B003VDTUY0|4.0|I bought this album primarily for the song &#34;So Far Away&#34;, which is by far the lightest song on it.  These guys are a perfect blend of modern and classic metal.  The solos are well-structured.  The drums are excellent.  This guy's voice is amazing, and perfect for the style of music they play.  I would recommend this album.
B005K17RU0|1.0|At least for our region (NE) these guys are usually wrong on what is going to happen tomorrow. Often times, they don't have the current conditions right. As far as long term forecasts, they completely blow it.
B0011Z31V8|4.0|When I saw the price of this album, I was stunned.  This album contains almost every song that I ever liked from Prince.
B009KEN87O|4.0|reminds me of child hood adventures playing this game every Saturday at the local bowling alley. only then the game was called Gallaga. This is like a combination of several good old games including space invaders!
B00913DPW2|1.0|Appstore application is a memory hog that has taken over the memory on my phone.  Hopefully they will fix or someone will find a workaround.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case looks good and the way it works is great.  Not only a cover case, but holds the device comfortably.
B0062EKXKK|5.0|I bought these cds for my sister and she LOVES them! If you are a Journey fan, you will enjoy these cds.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow! Just wow! What an amazing story! Brilliantly told. Keep me on the edge of my seat. Beautiful story of true love in many levels.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I have been playing this non-stop since getting it as a FAOTD. Amazing game. Wish the leaderboard worked so I could see where my time of 2:36 lands me.
0446585041|4.0|We need more role models like Ellen. She is chatty in her book in an informal way, but gets her messages across. Like being less judgemental, recycling, helping out others in small ways. I think she accomplished this well and has a great morale compass about humanity. Her book is not done in a preachy way, but more of how a good friend would give advice to you. There were several points she made in the book that I highlighted so I would remember them. Such as live in the moment, keep traveling down the road, even if you hit road blocks and obstacles. We could all use a few reminders along life's journey. I enjoyed this upbeat book.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Good game -- good fun love the good graphics and the variety of little extra challenges.  Kept me up later than I wanted to be last night.
B009S33I68|4.0|This book kept me up nights. Haunting how so many names kept returning to the narrative.<br /><br />I avoided this stupid war due to a back injury as a kid. Friends were not so lucky, and returned with a different view of life. Good? Bad? Stressed for sure. This wonderful narrative of America's wake up call battle totally absorbed me. A larger set of battle maps, or maps that could be enlarged would have helped, but at the end of the book, the picture was so well painted in my mind that they visual aids were unnecessary.<br /><br />The complete picture was provided by Col. Hal Moore, from training of our airmobile troops through battle post mortum with interviews of top NVA commanders and high level LBJ cohorts.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I was right when I protested the war at the Oakland induction center. McNamera gave the US a 1:3 chance of success in memos to LBJ. But the soldiers! Wow, how proud I am of  our troops and their officers. Great book.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|I was hoping in this book to find some practical and science-based advice on how I could improve my memory in ways that would be helpful in everyday life (like being able to view a screen with 5 separate numbers and then type them into another screen, or what to do when I am blocking on a name which should be familiar).  Instead what the author has spent most of the book doing is to give a detailed description of the history of competitive memorizing - decks of cards, a random series of numbers, a poem - and the techniques used by the most successful competitors  The fact that he himself becomes immersed in this adventure and eventually wins the US memory championship makes for an entertaining story populated with many fascinating and strange characters, but don't look for this book to help you solve your own everyday memory problems
0316228532|1.0|i am a huge Harry Potter fan and i assumed this book would be as well-written as the HP books.  NOT!!!  i barely made it through 3 chapters before i had to put the book down.  way too many names, way too many British-isms that make it hard to understand.  i found it quite boring, pointless and dull.  waste of money.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is awesome. pure action! I love it. you fight to the death to the zombies. you are a samurai warrior and can unlock other warriors. you get charms that help you such as the one that gives you a giant warrior.
B0000844I8|4.0|A classic of the genre. Wanted to view the TV version but needed to catch up first. The DVD was in great shape and arrived promptly.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Again this was my first experience of this author. I found it hard to put down and perhaps I enjoyed it more because of the setting. I spent my early childhood in Suffolk, I still have family there. For many years I have lived in Australia not too far from Tamborine Mountain and I have friends there.I liked this book for a great story well told and I didn't guess the ending.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was so  well written, intriguing, easy to understand and enlightening...I loved the insight and presenting both sides of the story...I am in the medical field but very much believe in the spiritual consciousness beyond what we can see...I encounter so many people who believe  that when are dead  you are gone...I wish I could give  this book to each one of them and show them that there is so much more..and from a neurological standpoint!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Story left me frustrated and kept me coming back for more. An unhappy housewife with too much time on her hands develops a very detailed treasure hunt for her anniversary gift to husband. She has all her tracks covered in an elaborate scheme to destroy him. It kept me on the edge.
0143112724|5.0|Delivery is fast. Good papar and ink quality. It is helpful on my class, but some inside knowledge is confusing me. But i love it
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|It used to work on my Nexus 7, but now it says that it is incompatible and won't even download to the device. What happened??
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|its a rally fun game except for the falling thrue wall glitch in 3-1 8-8 6-1 it makes me really mad if anyone knows how to fix it tell me
B009AOFNU4|2.0|Had to send it back...don't have time to wait around for an update.<br /><br />My impressions of the controller itself:<br /><br />-nice packaging as usual from steelseries<br />-ergonomically OK....a tad bit too small and I have small hands.  My wife even made a joke and asked if I bought a fisher price controller by accident.<br />-Instruction manual really didn't go into depth about the device.  More info online.  I would have appreciated a little more print in the manual.<br /><br />My verdict is to save your money.  They are asking WAY too much and it doesn't even work with the latest android operating system (at least for me).
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I have previously never played one of these Slender Man games, but I can see that it is supremely popular, and after playing it I can definitely see why. After reading many comments and noticing the overall rating I gave it a go and am extremely for doing so. This is such a great game. I was missing a good spooky game in my collection and this does well. Good clean graphics and fluid navigation. First time through didn't make me jump but audio was spooky, which is nice.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Ever since they added flow, the responsiveness has decreased. It seems more prone to stall while other apps are doing things and this is with flow disabled.<br /><br />Also, why did you remove punctuation from the predictive text? I used to be able to type a whole paragraph using only the predictions.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I just love all of the Step Up movies, my daughter & I have enjoyed every one of them so far.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Loved it! Every aspect. Well written with vast research and knowledge of NASA and their procedures.<br />Good stuff Andy. Looking forward to another.
B009KEN87O|5.0|When I saw this was the free app today I had to give it a shot. I'm on the second zone now and loving it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Omg this is a great game for kids who love horses no glitches perfect me personally I love this app
B00596WEVI|5.0|Well worth getting.  Van Damme and Scott Adkins both do a fantastic job in this film.  Loved it! I am now a fan of Scott A, but have always been a fan of JCVD.
B0067R0APK|1.0|Updated version is too busy and font is too small. I loved the calendar screen in the old version that showed large colorful icons for each day.  New version should at least have the option to customize the screen and hide unwanted sections like news and video... wish I could revert to the old version. It used to be my favorite weather app.  Now I no longer think I'll use it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|AWESOME! First app I bought. Multiplayer: 10 Campaign: 10 Controls: 9 ( I wish the controls were separated a little because sometimes I accidentally hit the fire button instead of the aim or Sprint button)<br />I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS GAME!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The book is similar to 50 Shades of Grey but quickly draws you in and takes on it's own life.  Very captivating and can't wait to read her thrid book in this series.
B000FA675C|5.0|The story flowed effortlessly and keep the interest going. The are several other works it brought to my mind that helped to keep the interest level high and wondering just how this would work its ending. I would gladly advise people to read this work, for it make  you think about your faith and ponder why.
B008OOYALE|3.0|For free this is a pretty good game. It takes quite a bit of time to get it rolling but it does get more fun as you go if you are patient.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Entertaing book, but I knew Jacob was guilty. The story is very depressing as the relationship between husband and wife deteriates
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After research and the reviews for the price I figured I would buy it. The mouse is great, the software is easy to use and you can save different profiles. Only 2 at a time are available in the software to switch between. Programming was easy and works every time with every game I have used it with. I think for the price it compares to some of the expensive mice. The buttons feel great and the mouse is big so with my larger hands I have no issues. It does come with weights, which I have used and like very much. Give a better feel to the mouse. The Anker is the only one you can change colors as started in other reviews, I just turn mine off since your hand covers anyway. The feel and move is great, can be adjusted fully based on personal needs. For the first time that they produced a mouse I think they did a great job.<br />I also was impressed the Anker reached to me and wanted to know if I was happy with the product.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Oscar Wilde proclaimed himself to be more of an aesthetic yet this cautionary tale is rife  with moral warnings and spiritual analogy. It is truly haunting in some places and almost blissfully gruesome in others. Well written and a great example of aphorisms in literature it is one of my favorite Victorian era novels.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Edge of seat viewing. Though you know end result, still pulls you in all the way until that final bullet!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Season after season just gets better and I look forward to every Sunday! The boys and I enjoy our Sunday evenings.......
B0002ADY0Q|5.0|Rated 5  The remastering of sound is unbelievable lot of bonus material very informative booklet and  song Salisbury just overwhelming  I ve got a goosebumps
B008SOS63S|5.0|Nice collection of Bonamassa and other blues artists live. Having the digital cloud version instantly available was a great plus.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I have so much fun passing the winter months away with a good game like this game.  I don't realize that it may be snowing or worse outside.  Great when there is nothing on the TV.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This an absolutely superb feel good Christmas movie that everyone can enjoy and should enjoy. Enough said it speaks for it's self.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app gives me easy access to my notes. I can keep track of my thoughts and raising pictures instead of all the typing is a time saver. I snap pics of my favorite songs cover so I remember to get them later.
B00ANGICRE|5.0|An amazing story told in the right way. It never becomes bored or pitiful which is so easy when you get to illness movies. The performance is outstanding. It is well worth the money
B002G1YPH0|1.0|I knew going in that the stock fan for AMD A-10 5800K was worthless, so i thought maybe with the great reviews this would be a much better upgrade....Wrong! Even at factory settings my CPU sits idle at 55°C with this Unit and I even put on a second fan.<br />While the system was on I felt the base next to the CPU and it was ice cold, no warmth whatsoever. I doubt if it was even doing anything whatsoever to keep things cool. Also, I doubt if it helped that no matter what i did, you can not get this thing to tighten down all the way down without it wobbling or twisting.<br /><br />I should have just bought a water oooler in the first place.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, but left very awkwardly, I don't know just abruptly. Going to read next one. I hope it's more exciting.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I gave it to my husband and he enjoyed it.  He wasn't expecting it so it made his day..... Thanks
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This will be my 300th review on Amazon, and I saved it for something truly special, and that something special is Wreck-It Ralph. It is my new favorite movie, taking the crown from my last favorite movie, which reigned from 1995 until 2013. I was so awestruck by this movie that after we rented it, we bought the HD digital version from Amazon Instant Video before it was available on disc, and watched it over and over again, and I have now bought the movie on blu-ray as well (Disney is getting their money out of me) so I can watch it without having to wait for things to buffer :)<br /><br />This movie resonated with me in ways that I haven't experienced in a long, long time. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING \\"clicked\\" perfectly for me with this movie. I realize that just because I love a movie, doesn't mean everyone else will, but I will try to explain below my reasons why I love it, in the hopes that people who may not have wanted to give this movie a chance, will do so.<br /><br />First, the sound is just perfect. If you played video games in the 1980s, you will immediately recognize the sounds they use in the movie, and that will raise the nostalgia level for you. They also integrate those same types of sounds into the music, making the whole movie \\"feel\\" like a video game.<br /><br />Second, the themes in the movie of the misunderstood \\"bad guy\\" and the underdog situations are very compelling to me. [Minor spoiler] And being the father of an adopted daughter, I empathized strongly with Ralph adopting Vanellope and looking after her, and putting her goals and needs above his. I think anyone who has cared for a child will resonate with that theme.[/END: Minor spoiler]<br /><br />Third, the voice acting is superb. I love, LOVE Sarah Silverman, and having her voice Vanellope was just beyond genius. She has one of those voices that I would recognize anywhere, like James Earl Jones -- it is instantly recognizable. Even the supporting cast got great voice actors that fit their characters well. I especially loved Alan Tudyk's take on King Candy as a modified Mad Hatter-type character (he has stated himself that he based his character's performance on the Ed Wynn's Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland).<br /><br />Fourth, I loved Calhoun (the tough female soldier). I love that she is a nail-biting no-nonsense soldier who also feels vulnerable on the inside when someone calls her a \\"dynamite gal.\\" Her side story with Felix is very believable and very touching at times.<br /><br />Fifth, I loved the idea of \\"Bad Anon\\" as a support group for \\"bad guys\\" in games, and seeing old favorites from Mortal Kombat, Mario, and even Pac-Man sitting around and sharing about how they \\"may be bad guys, but, that doesn't make them ... bad ... guys...\\" :)<br /><br />Sixth, I really can't get enough of the \\"Toy Story\\" idea of what's-going-on-when-we're-not-looking? They said so themselves in the special features of the blu-ray that they were exploring that trope with this movie, and I am more than OK with that. I find it fascinating to think of video game characters living out separate lives from their games once the humans go away ... and they've barely scratched the surface of gaming! There are MMORPGs, console games, handheld games, phone games, Flash games, and more to still explore. I can see all kinds of possibilities for a sequel.<br /><br />Finally, I loved the ending.<br />[Moderate Spoiler Warning]<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />There are certain kinds of human actions that I think most people will say captivate their attention, send shivers running up and down their spine, and invoke a certain kind of awe -- and I would say that self sacrifice for the greater good (a'la Spock) or for a loved one, tend to rank the highest in our admiration.  The moment where Ralph makes the tough decision and realizes what the greater importance is, and what kind of honor and medals truly count, and then acts on it, is a fantastic one. The music of the momentis perfect, and the build-up to the moment is perfect, and the resolution to the action is perfect. (See, I didn't spoil it too badly ^_-)<br />[/END: Moderate Spoiler Warning]<br /><br />In my opinion, Disney hit it out of the ballpark with this one. I was mildly surprised to see that Disney was behind the movie when it came out, and impressed. They have certainly come a long way from Home on the Range (widely considered to be not just one of the worst Disney movies of all time, but one of the worst animated movies of all time).<br /><br />I own this movie, and I love it. It is a rare gem. It is heartwarming, family-friendly comedy/action/adventure with a video game twist. There is no swearing (although there is a bit of juvenile bathroom humor I could have done without), there is no serious violence (the only things that get truly hurt or killed in the movie are monster bugs, and Disney-villains, and they just vaporize when they die), and there are no serious dark elements to the movie. It is a movie you can put on when you want to feel better about the world, and it is my new favorite movie.<br /><br />5 stars.is perfect, and the build-up to the moment is perfect, and the resolution to the action is perfect.

B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Martin Freeman (\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\") stars as Bilbo Baggins. He's a reluctant hero with a good heart and extremely likeable. Sir Ian McKellen returns to his role as Gandalf the Grey - a younger Gandalf from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Returning roles also include: Cate Blanchett as Galadriel; Ian Holm as Old Bilbo; Christopher Lee as Saruman; Hugo Weaving as Elrond; Elijah Wood as Frodo; and Andy Serkis as Gollum. It's a bit odd going back and doing a prequel story, making characters younger. But with the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's not surprising that The Hobbit was picked up as well.<br /><br />Nine years after the release of the Return of the King also means that the CGI and cinematography is even that much more fantastic. The rich landscapes are breathtaking. And the creature effects are incredibly impressive and life-like. In fact, my only complaint is that the novel The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien has been split into three movies. It felt like parts of this installment could have been skipped in order to fit everything in - and just made into a slightly longer film. But I'm sure the movie makers want the extra money that 3 films can bring instead of 1 or even 2.<br /><br />This first installment in the Hobbit trilogy is a fun, thrilling, adventure. Full of humor, suspense, drama, and magic - fantasy fans will certainly enjoy. Since this is the first in the trilogy of films (and it's based on only one novel) the film ends in an abrupt, awkward place.  And the wait for the next installments seem painfully long.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Beautifully directed. Cinematography was well done. However, so much from the book was left out. It could have been longer.
B00AA0TZTW|1.0|If Jimi had played clarinet in the high school band Janie would dig up a recording of it, Eddie Kramer would remix it, and they would sell it to you as new Hendrix.<br />All of these tunes exist in better takes on other records and the ones that don't were never meant to see the light of day. Go buy any of the first 5 or releases. That's what Jimi wanted people to hear. Janie was 8 years old when Jimi died and not a real relative in any sense of the word. Save your money, I hear the next one will be a Jimi /Whitney duet record.<br />If you have to have this, get the Bestbuy version, at least you get a T-shirt and some guitar picks with it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|in order to win you got to have fast fingers to slip and slide and you to dodge them ships
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Well, actually I fell asleep around 6:00 a.m. with my Kindle in my hand. But later when I got up, I started reading again. This book is very suspenseful, and I was glad I had my big dog here with me.<br /><br />Next time I hear \\"Well, haven't they ever heard of divorce?\\" or \\"If it were me, I would just leave,\\" I will steer them to this book. Arrogant, opinionated people just don't want to understand what it's like to be in an abusive relationship. I guess they are happy in their own safe little worlds, and the idea that it's possible not to be safe is something they can't bear to think about.<br /><br />I couldn't believe this was a first novel. I'm going to read the second one soon (I like to alternate authors). I wish Elizabeth Haynes much success. She is a major talent.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the most fun interactive game that I have played for many many years and I am 79 years old!!! :-)
B00BWJB5H0|2.0|Kevin Bacon is awesome (and intense); however, after watching the entire available first season, I find it difficult to imagine them making another season chasing after the same psychotic madman who continues to elude being caught and has a host of \\"sick\\" individuals doing his work.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|Great book, kept my attention. Looking forward to the next one in the series. Hoping it's as good as ugly
0062082353|4.0|A good read but he is sure full of himself, as all SEALs are, but gives an accurate view of the IRAQ war.  Well written! What really set me off was calling me and my Navy brothers 'If you don't wear the trident than your just one of those regular Navy pukes!';  Well kiss my fantail!  But WE still love you! Guard those gates of Heaven as you guarded our freedom on Earth!
B007MDB71O|5.0|BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!<br /><br />THE BEST DISNEY PRINCESS - PRINCE ROMANCE, ACTION, NEW WORLDS, WONDERFUL ACTING WITH LYNN COLLINS AS PRINCESS DEJAH THORIS WHO IS JUILLIARD TRAINED GRADUATE WITH A BLACK BELT IN MARTIAL ARTS AND SHE MAKES THE FIGHT SCENES FEEL AUTHENTIC.

SEARCHING FOR A CAUSE AFTER LOSING HIS FAMILY, JOHN CARTER FINDS IT ON BARSOOM. DEJAH THORIS IS BURDENED WITH SAVING HER CITY IN THE MIDST OF A CIVIL WAR AND SAVING HER PLANET. GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND ACTION. YOU'LL WATCH IT SEVERAL TIMES. A CLASSIC.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I found this game to be great fun.  Personally I find all of this companies a lot of fun. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a great adventure.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I love the Paranormal Activity movies, even though I think the last few were awful. The first is the scariest and the best one. I bought this as a replacement for a friend's copy that I accidentally broke. It came on time and was not damaged. A good buy!
B009R5GR1K|4.0|Free Dictionary Plus is very good. My only complaint: the screen layout upon lookup of a word is a bit confusing. There are two parts of display - top part and bottom.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this for my 9 year old twin boys to play on my Kindle Fire for doing so good in school. They both love it!
0763655465|5.0|What a wonderful book this is!  Presents the ideas of good/bad choice, forgiveness and apology.  The ending is open to interpretation, and is a great conversation starter with kids.  Highly recommend this one.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a master piece. It is hard to find another story matches this level of achievement, if possible ever.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game and its free.  I have it on my IPhone also and I love it. I love that it is free.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|It's ok, but a little boring for my 3 1/2 year old son. It can/should be more fun for kids.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|The quality and animation is top-notch.  The scenes where that &#34;large&#34; prairie dog family is flying those bird fighters or whatever pursuing Rango was hilarious.  I kept thinking, &#34;Luke, use the force!&#34;  The storyline incorporates several parodies of popular movies over the years.  I won't say which because I can't remember them at the moment, but you'll recognize them when you see them.  The family and kids should really enjoy it!  Watch it together!
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Clutch is back, to straight up in your face, Rock and Roll!! Influences from previous albums are here (Beale) (Strange Cousins), just in the back seat of the Swinger, instead of the drivers seat. This album hearkens back to the days of Pure Rock Fury and Blast Tyrant, while still preserving the evolutionary steps they have taken through that period of time. Neil is on point with his lyrics and as always the rest of the band is as tight as it gets. Having been to more Clutch shows than fingers and toes on my body. I can attest to this being one of their most complete albums to date. From The Bluesy riffs of D.C Sound Attack, To the up tempo, almost punk rock-ish Unto the Breach. This album has a lot of flare and style of its own.  Then add in Powerful straight up Rock and Roll songs like Earth Rocker, Crucial Velocity, and Cyborg Bette and you will find this album is anything but shallow. The only thing better then buying it now? Seeing it LIVE after you BUY it... Do it... Do it..
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is better then most games! I recommend it for anyone! It has its challenge but sure does waste some time.
B007MD2RHC|5.0|This album is by far my favorite from the year 2011! The melodies of the songs are what I noticed. \\"Femme Fatal\\" has a very magical piano as well as \\"Sonera\\". I'm a pianist myself and boy, do I wish I could play like that! I loved all the tracks besides the intro track \\"Aura\\". I'm not a fan of electro/orchestral music all that much but other than that, fantastic album! I hope the sequel to this album is just as good! And if not, better! My top five favorite tracks are \\"Illusions\\", \\"Femme Fatal\\", \\"Starvation\\", \\"A Place in Heaven\\", and \\"Sonera\\".<br /><br />Fabulous album! I highly recommend it for anyone who likes Two Steps From Hell, Immediate Music, Audiomachine, etc.<br /><br />P.S. I got the Audio CD and the jewel casing is spectacular! I also recommend you get the Audio CD.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app I'm addicted. :) blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This is a fun game to play, the only problem being having to wait for energy to fill.  I love playing multiple games of this type, I just move on to another game while my energy recharges.  I don't really understand why people complain about this. Play a bunch of free games and you will constantly have something to do. It is absolutely not necessary to spend any money on these games.
B00007E7K0|5.0|After receiving it in the mail I instantly thought i'm keeping this because it was way better quality then the one that came with my Canon EOS! I was very satisfied with this product and highly recommend it! You will not be disappointed.
B009KEN87O|5.0|enjoy this old fashion game....feel like a kid again. works well...<br />very addicting....tell you friends...challenge them. I go it for free...but worth buying for sue...
B003OWVHVC|3.0|Bought this album after hearing the tune in a commercial. The album is rather nice, but has some tunes I had to listen to over a period of time to appreciate them. While I would say it is not chock full of creativity on some of the songs, it is a great introduction.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I had an IPhone with this app on it, and had to replace the phone.  Found this app and love it.  It syncs with my Kindle Fire and my IPod perfectly.  This way, no matter where I am or which device I happen to be carrying, I have access to my Kindle library.  Thanks, Amazon!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This was a paint to use deleted it and loaded the free mobile app. That is much more user-friendly on my fire he.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|Although much of the media on this app is similar to UTube videos, there are free movie sites that change regularly.  (Personally I was not looking for new or poliotical blurbs, so do not use that piece of the app.)  It sometimes reloads alot, sometimes not.  Unsure what that issue is, and some of the free movies do contain ads, but, after all, it's free!
B006H5120E|5.0|I have owned this move on DVD back in the day. While this is a great movie, I won't get into the film itself, just more of the Blu Ray Quality.<br /><br />I do own a 3D TV, I must say that the 3D version of the movie is not impressive, there is no pop out effect, &#34;some might call it gimmick&#34; but some movies just have no business being in 3D. The only part that looks good in 3D out of the whole 3 hour movie, is the sinking part, and it's only when Rose is &#34;saving jack&#34; from being held as a prisoner.<br /><br />The quality of Blu Ray, as far as the 2D image is awesome. It creates a GREAT sound, depth, and the movie looks as if it was shot in 2009, much closer than 1995-1997. However it does make old Rose's wrinkles look much worst because of the clarity. If you are a movie collector, I recommend owning the Blu Ray version of Titanic.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|The ability to watch the growth of characters and scenarios is wonderful. This was my first purchase for a TV series and it was a great one. I recommend this video to everyone that enjoys Sci Fy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its the best game ever! I play it all the time I think every one should get it I love it so so so much
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|this lost all of my freaken progress I hats this but head game uhh<br /> I hats this game so much I deleted it hahaha beat that makers of this game
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Lauren Oliver again told a very compelling story full of metaphors and beautiful lyrical language.<br /><br />I loved most of the book. Although I was frustrated with Lana and how she reacted to Alex's anger toward her jumping into Julian's arms for comfort I got why the story progressed that way in the beginning. I waited and wanted to see them (Lana/Alex) make there way back to each other.....and I waited and waited. I was so heartbroken for them knowing how much they loved each other and seeing how they hurt each other and the longing.<br /><br />There was so much build up for the final showdown in the book and I couldn't stop reading. Seeing both Lana and Hana's PoV was nice too. It was interesting to see the political side of the issues and how the cureds perceive the world around them from a cured.<br /><br />Trilogies are so hard to wrap up it seems and many times the last book leaves something to be wanted. But I had high hopes it was going well and then it ended.....and I looked to see if there were 1-2 more wrap up chapters or something but there wasn't. Even though the love story wasn't the main story of the book (Oh wait I sorta thought it was back in Delirium at least) I really wanted just a little more closure there.<br />(view spoiler)<br /><br />Solid Trilogy. Disappointing ending. I would say that the first 95% of the book gets 5 stars and the last 5% gets 2 stars.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|...yes, I was hugely impressed by this book! It's perfectly edited, deceptively simple, charming, and (oh joy!) without any grammar or punctuation errors. Aside from that, though, it's just really, really good.<br /><br />I know absolutely nothing about this period of history, but I know that Ms Saadia is something of an authority on it, and this comes across. Although the book is fiction based on historical fact (a genre I love), it could also be read purely as a work of fiction, an adventure story; it's interesting from a historical point of view, but the main strength of it is in the story telling. The writing is smooth and easily readable, with no superfluous or overly detailed passages, and I read it in only about four sittings. Ms Saadia has created the story from the young men's point of view so cleverly; in some ways it seemed like a young adult's novel. She is obviously a natural story teller, and a gifted writer - there was absolutely nothing forced about it. At no point was I aware of any studied technique, which was lovely; one of the drawbacks with reading when you write yourself is that you tend to read like an editor, but I forgot all about that while I was reading this. I just enjoyed it. I'm a great lover of the GRR Martin 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series - this reminded me of those books, in parts.<br /><br />I've read a couple of reviews that say the language is wrong, because the people of that time wouldn't have used words like 'kid' - but the dialogue is stylised, so well; after all, they wouldn't have used any of the words we use, would they? It's obvious that the author has researched the terms of speech that the people of that time and place would have used.<br /><br />I have another of Ms Saadia's books to read (At Road's End), but I look forward to reading the others in this series, the Rise of the Aztecs, too. Highly recommended, even if it's not your usual genre.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Solid game, controls work great and it progressively gets more challenging while keeping the vintage feel of an arcade shooter. Worth the money.
1451627297|5.0|I can't express how much I love this book. Usually Stephen King books scare me but this one not so much.<br />I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing wen we heard that the President had been sot.<br />You go STEPHEN KING

B0070YDOT8|1.0|Big Fish Casino has quite the racket going here. Now there's nothing wrong with making a profit, obviously that's the underling reason most apps exist. But to be so blatantly money-hungry that a person could spend $20 on chips and not even get 4 minutes of play time on a slot machine that will never have to pay out one single penny in real money is real greed. If you login for 6 days in a row you get 10000 free chips, wow and great, but wait when you hit on a slot your winnings are less than you bet, you are actually losing while winning and again on a machine that will never ever have to pay out one red cent in actual money. Need another example? Log in for 7 days in a row and you get a gold bar. What can you do with 1 gold bar, nothing. Log in for 28 days in a row and earn your 4 gold bars, excellent you can now redeem those for.....you guessed it 10000 chips. These are just some of the rip offs this game perpetrates and I could list more and give examples of their customer service but this is long enough as it is. Buyer beware!

0744014549|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moEZCWD1HA31TO]]This book is thicker than I expected. I know it's 272 pages from the description but it's really quick thick with the heavy paper stock.<br /><br />Tomb Raider. Ah. I've always wanted to have a Tomb Raider artbook. Love the environments. This book is filled with wonderful concept art of the characters and environments. Surprising, or maybe not, about 80 percent of the book are on the environments.<br /><br />Looking at the environment art, it reminded me instantly of Uncharted 2's artbook, except here it's much darker to suit the mood of the game. The colours are muted, the world is harsh, bleak, and the sun doesn't shine through much. There are art for the forests, villages, worn down buildings, monasteries and a bit on ship Endurance.<br /><br />The art is great. You get a good sense of this exotic, mysterious and weather battered island. It really makes you wonder who lived there.<br /><br />It's a wonderful companion artbook to the game. Highly recommended.<br /><br />If you like this type of art, definitely check out [[ASIN:1921002719 The Art of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]] also.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My old Kindle cable stopped working because it got loose at the connection point and I was unable to charge my Kindle.  The new cable is 150 times tighter and charges better than the old cord ever did.  Thanks!
0062231375|5.0|This is a great overall product that works well. This was a great price point for what we were looking to spend.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Like space invaders, but with more responsive controls and you can move your spaceship up in the field. Definitely recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing and created for all ages, one warning, it's very addicting!!!! I love it and so do my sister's, they were the ones that got me hooked on it
B004I744AS|1.0|Dictionary would not download.  It may be OK but who knows?  I cannot personally recommend this product.  I will not try again.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|The first third of this book should appeal to all. It exhibits a gritty honesty that is refreshing. The rest is a detailed manual of the pen.
1439102813|4.0|This book allows you a glimpse of what it's like inside the head of someone with dementia. My father has dementia and this book clarified some questions I had. Alice is an amazing woman with a great family. The strength the characters possess is inspirational.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|Room is an eloquently written novel that just makes you want to read one more page, and then one more....<br /><br />Make sure you persevere through the first couple of chapters- it is totally worth it.
B004TI5N38|5.0|The book envelops the reader.  You get the feel for the scenery, you can almost taste the coal dust.  This is the second book with the John Puller character, there should be more books with him.  Baldacci's are certainly good reads.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I literally just bought this like 5 minutes ago, tried to adjust something in video mode and now it keeps crashing. I can't even get to the video mode to change it. Not a happy customer right now
B0015DROBO|5.0|As good as the (Swedish) movie was, the book is better.  There is a lot of story that could not all be put into a movie and it's worth having all of it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked this dictionary because it is usefully for all type of homework. What I did dislike of the dictionary is that it does not have some words I needed for all of my homework. I would recommend this dictionary to everyone in the world.<br />Abner_cocom
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A sweet book that uplifts the reader/listener. Wonderful performances by the readers add to the story. Not too much syrupy stuff that normally puts me off. Well done.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is a small book but big on inspiration. The quotes sprinkled throughout have you nodding your head. I bought it at a particularly difficult time in my life a few months ago and it has stayed on my mind ever since. One thing I noticed was that somehow it was not a depressing read at all. As a matter of fact, I found myself feeling rather light-headed as I read it, almost if the burden I was feeling was being lifted off my shoulders. The eventual impact was realizing that nothing is bad as it seems to be and that there is always a solution to any problem. And most importantly, it reinforces in you an ability to address your issues by distancing yourself from them and looking at them objectively...like a physician might cock his head and study the symptoms on his patient. It's kind of hard to explain. Get the book. Victor's prose is much more easy on the senses!
B00BESNKB8|1.0|Why any woman would ever enjoy this movie is beyond comprehension. Just awful. I rate it four large stinky piles.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Enjoyed watching this with my wife on movie night at home.  Good intrigue and some intense action scenes. A fun action movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game! It reminds me of going to the fair when I was a kid. So much fun to play!
B005DESVPO|5.0|Outstanding sound and wonderfully addictive beat.  I look forward to his next original blues foray.  Do not miss this fine young talent.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|So far I love it!  A great game!  I love the puzzles, logic problems and mystery. It's just my type of game.
B00B23O96A|2.0|Dang, I had hoped for much better from 'slowhand'  The only song worth listening to on this album is the first reggae beat one.  The rest are not even mediocre, as his voice really shows the strain and effects of a hard road and advancing age.  There is very little classic Clapton guitar work here, and the songs are uninspired to say the least. Instead of buying this old dog; check out the last CD from Alvin Lee, put together shortly before his untimely death.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show will have you addicted to it by the first episode. If you haven't seen Season 1 stop reading this and go and buy Season 1 immediately!!!!  With all of the characters in this show it can be confusing as to who is with who but once you get it, it will blow your mind. Once you see all of the treachery going on within the show there is no way NOT to get invested in the characters. The actors do a great job in this show and the sets are amazing.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I thought this was a tremendous movie, especially when they went to Scotland.I loved it. It was great.  Kathryn Punton
0132350882|5.0|If you wanna professional code styles and craftmanship experience coding you should read this book. The Author of book is a real craftmanship about 40 years developing experience. This book changed my coding style as I like it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Is it possible to say that I enjoyed  this book? It was truly a painful experience and the specter of death dampened it's funniest and  most meaningful moments....and yet, I enjoyed this book. Now I will eat a pint of Ben & Jerry's and read something with Vampires in it.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Just read it, really.  If you have any interest at all in the intersection of economics and politics, just read anything by Paul Krugman.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Few shows these days are as well made and easy to watch (not too depressing, not too absurd, but engaging, smart, and fun).
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Very impressed with this game!!! The interface is graphically attractive and entertaining, and the play is challenging but easy to understand.
B001MSMUH0|4.0|I saw Sir Ken speak at a conference a year ago and he was both enlightening and entertaining.  This book is the same.  The challenges and opportunities for the human race are many and Sir Ken shows the perils in thinking and acting as we always have but also the amazing potential in all of us.
B000001EAQ|5.0|It is a great album and it is different to the others they have done. It is extremely under rated!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|...still good TV. Re NPR commentary re anachronisms, so what, as long as it's enjoyable and the errors are not glaring.  E.g., \\"Mad Men\\" or, so I've heard, the movie \\"Lincoln.\\"
B004GXKBCY|5.0|Spy Game is a very honest film about a good professional that at the end is coherent with his values no matters what imples to his own all life savings. Finally friendship is vey important in our lives.<br />--------------------------------------------<br />Though the end of the film is not exactly in line with the development, is a really enjoyable film with great permorfances.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My wife and I dig this show. We're normally not legal based drama fans but this is fun stuff - for now.  Hopefully, USA can keep it up or end it on a good and satisfying note.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Good movie all around. A few parts that were like &#34;really?&#34;. But i guess that's bond for you! :) !
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|I just got this App. tonight and being a Jazz fan, I just loved it. I loved how there was so many stations to pick from. It worked great on my Kindle Fire HD. When I listened to the music, I ran the Visualations in the back ground from this other App. I have and It was so relaxing. This is a winner. I am a senior, so I like all the older jazz, like big band music and Jazz.
B009KEN87O|3.0|Good job on this one guys...  a very fun distraction.  I like the 3D stuff, I would've never thought of Space Invaders in that way.
B007R41E8O|4.0|This game is a good buy but you need to make time for downloading and I don't mean a couple of hours, you need TWO DAYS. When I tried it the first day it took my whole day. Then when I thought it was done it downloaded again, I thought it was my connection but no everything was connected. On the second day I thought if this doesn't work I'm requesting a refund, a while later it FINALLY was ready to play. Well, the game was great, I love &quot;find the hidden object&quot; games and this did not disappoint until...it started shutting down and starting at the menu, I didn't lose my spot totally but it took me back few seconds in the game so I had to make sure I had the object that I had just found. The game has great graphics and a long play time, which I like a lot. The only reason I gave it less than 5 stars is because of the inconvenience of waiting for it to download and you can't let it shut off to save your battery life, downloading stops and will NOT move until you go into the app store and open it again and again and again, yikes!!! When I say babysit your Kindle I mean it. One more piece of info, use your note book instead of hints, sometimes it's all you need.
1426308469|3.0|this book is a little too difficult for my 6 and 4 year old.  I hope they will enjoy it when they are ready for this book.
B008LVCKH6|1.0|I found this book to be very silly. I ended up skipping many parts, which is unusual. Save your money for a better read!
0345803485|1.0|Don't waste your money and time on reading Fifty Shades of Grey because it's just not worth it. The only entertainment value in the book (and in the series for that matter) is in its laughably awful writing with barely anything resembling a decent storyline. The books all read like the sex dreams of a bunch of young, naive teenage girls rather than a 40-something year-old married woman. Christian is an abusive, controlling man who seems to be a step or two away from qualifying as a serial killer and Ana is a pathetic, weak-willed young woman who lets him do whatever he wants and even makes excuses for his behavior. She thinks that she can change him if she just stays with him long enough and gives him everything he wants. What a horrible message for anyone to send out to readers. If you do a Google search, you can find numerous webpages that criticize some of the examples of bad writing in the series, especially in the first book.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I got this for my 7-year-old grandson.  He loved it!  He has been singing that song, Supercalifragilisticexpealdocious. Such a happy film.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love playing but when I try to get in it says imigi studios then goes to the home page!!!!!!!Otherwise its a fun game. I would NOT reccomend this to kindle fire users.
B00005RDRO|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and love the combination of comedy and mystery.  Having all of the great actors doing a wonderful job as their characters was perfect.  I introduced my grandchildren to this movie and they love it too.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I read this book and couldn't wait to see the movie.  It was spell-binding and I couldn't put it down.  In fact, I ended up reading all the books in this series, and each one didn't disappoint.  Hope they make more movies out of the books!  Loved the fast service.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you enjoyed the first season of GoT, you will love season 2! For the price you can't go wrong here; Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy make this a great value. The picture and sound quality are exceptional. The layout/packaging is very similar to Season 1, so if you have that you pretty much know what to expect here.
B002V091IO|4.0|Loved it. I had seen the movie first, but David Nicholls' writing added layers of perception and humour to the story. Cried.
B009KEN87O|1.0|Would not install on my Kindle HD and would not open after download on my Nook Tablet (android enabled.)  Had to go into my Amazon account to totally delete the item.  Makes you wonder......Looked like fun but we will never know now!
B0089BSM70|5.0|great release from scream factory great speacial features really glad I ordered this  and can't wait for scream factory to release the howling on blu ray
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What a great book. I am glad this happened to a \\"brain\\" doctor so he can explain away the scientific probability of this just being \\"memories\\" or whatever.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone. We all need to keep an open mind and truly know we don't end here.
075669910X|4.0|This volume is a very good resource for the overwhelming theme:  history of earth and its life.  The focus on &#34;Young Earth&#34; is a good introduction to Earth's formation 4.56 billion years ago. The first 500 million years is discussed in terms of Earth's core and mantle (including the &#34;Iron Catastrophe&#34;), the crust, magnetism, and formation of the sequence of atmospheres.  Plate tectonics is also capsuled along with today's vital topic, climate change and its evidence in the rock and the fossil records. Even a graphic and explanation are provided for the complexity of orbital cycles--orbital eccentricity, tilt, and precession.<br /><br />The many photos and diagrams, often printed in white small type on glossy black, make the reading experience dynamic and addicting.  The introductory feast continues with layouts featuring the development of life (microscopic, invertebrate, vertebrate, plant) from 3.5 bya to its proliferation throughout Archean, Proterozoic, Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene intervals.  The Rise of the Humans is a concluding focus for this volume and highlights human evolution from seven million years ago to post Ice Age.  A glossary and dinosaur list are helpful pages for studying the contents.<br /><br />A handy reference and text indeed is this Dorling Kindersley (DK) -- London/New York/Melbourne/Munich/Delhi 2009/2012 -- publication, all 512 pages.<br /><br />csa  3/22/2013 Friday  Johnstown, Colorado USA
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Ok, this might be a moderately entertaining Middle Earth film, but it is NOT a good rendition of \\"The Hobbit\\".  Key dialog is changed or missing.  Key scenes are changed or missing.  Character portrayals are off, by a lot.  There is a ton of made up material that is nowhere to be found in the book.  Sequences of events are out of order, wrong, or just plain nonsense.<br /><br />The whole thing is really quite,quite bad.<br />So, do yourself a favor and rent this before buying it.<br />Especially if you are a fan of the book.<br /><br />It is really not up to the standard of quality of the Lord of the Rings films.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Amazingly addictive and really enjoyable I loved this game I wasn't sure if it would be a waste to download but it's wonderful... highly recommend
B00005R2IS|3.0|I forgot to read all the small letters.<br />It dosen´t work in Sweden.<br /><br />The film is good and would really want to see it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I chalk this up to something like cilantro: You're gonna love it or hate it.  I've never been compelled to write a review before but this just put me over the edge.<br /><br />Reading this book made me want to pry my eyeballs out with a spoon.  The plot was ludicrous and the language so unbelievably juvenile, it's pathetic and hysterical at the same time.<br /><br />This book is an insult to human intelligence, to sensuality and to sexuality.  It reduces the enticingly dark and mysterious side of sexual exploration into some sort of corny and overly cliche B movie-type parody.  Count the number of times the writer uses the phrase  &#34;...jeez.&#34; in this book.  Seriously?!  WHY?!  It's just friken ridiculous, it makes my skin crawl.<br /><br />If you want to read it because of the hype, by all means, I won't stop you.  After all, I gave in.  Maybe you'll read it by the fireplace, maybe you'll want to throw it into the fire, or maybe it'll set you on fire.  Again, you're either going to love it or hate it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Una de las mejores compras, el pedido llegó a tiempo y en excelente estado, la serie es de lo mejor
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I love their traditional instrumental sound with modern/folk style tunes.  Very emotional feel to all of the tracks.  Some happy, some serious.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|I watched the DVD last night with my family. I recommend the DVD/CD combo to get the full experience. The quality of the music is award winning. Darlene and her message is very uplifting and inspiring. I am sure this will be something that we will enjoy and think about for years to come.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I love their traditional instrumental sound with modern/folk style tunes.  Very emotional feel to all of the tracks.  Some happy, some serious.
1608199096|5.0|This is a beautiful book ... there is something visceral and immediately obvious as soon as you hold in your hands, in this sense it goes way beyond cook book boundaries
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|It is an addictive, fun game. There are many prizes you could win. Some prizes include candy, cars, and many more! So you should get this game because you also level up fast.
B00A7OJ0DC|1.0|I LOVE this movie and purchased the Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy edition.  My family enjoys watching movies on DVD at home, so I wanted the DVD.  We're going on a long flight next week, so I wanted the digital copy in order to play the movie on my Kindle Fire to keep my kids entertained.  However, the digital copy is NOT in a format that will play on the Kindle Fire.  I've been on the phone with Amazon for over 40 minutes trying to find out how to make this work.  They've suggested that I can either 1) pay for and download a poorly rated video player from the Amazon Appstore that might allow me to play  the .wmv file that my digital copy contains, or 2) return my purchase, then repurchase the DVD as well as Amazon's version of the digital copy.  I don't understand why Amazon doesn't make it clear in the item details that the digital copy in this set will NOT play on their Kindle Fire.  Obviously, they want me to download digital content directly from Amazon for my Kindle (which I knew before purchasing my Kindle - good business plan that I can respect), but come on - at least be upfront about it.
B004KWVDWI|5.0|Haven't watched it yet.I assume it will be in prime shape when I do.I'm really looking forward to watching it on my theatre system!
0525950079|5.0|I loved this book. I re-read Pillars of the Earth prior to starting World Without End because I am such a fan of Follett. This sequel was just as fascinating as the original. A must read!
B00BF11STU|2.0|I had high hopes for this film. After all, it was based upon one of the most dramatic events in recent history and filmed by the Academy Award winning director of \\"The Hurt Locker\\".  But it failed to deliver on its potential.  Perhaps that's because the director and screenwriter made a decision to focus on their fictional central character - a young CIA agent portrayed by Jessica Chastain - rather than upon the ten-year arc of actual events leading to the killing of Osama bin Laden.  Thus, the film became a story of the Jessica Chastain character against the CIA bureaucracy, rather than a story of the United States versus terrorism.  And frankly, Chastain's character, over-written and over-acted though she is, simply isn't very believable or very interesting.<br /><br />Moreover, the valiant Navy Seals who made the raid upon bin Laden's compound in Pakistan are given very, very short shrift.  They're simply an indistinguishable group of one-dimensional figures stumbling around in the murky green half-light of starlight scopes, blowing up doors and climbing stairs.<br /><br />In \\"Argo\\", Ben Affleck took a story we all knew, with an ending that we all knew and created a gripping, fast-paced thriller.  In \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\", Katheryn Bigelow takes a story we all knew, with an ending we all knew and created a plodding story about a central character we don't care about, with one of the most unsatisfying climactic sequences ever filmed.
B00915G6MG|5.0|My husband & I just love the NCIS!! All of the charactors have there own personlity and we enjoy watching them grow in each episode.. We have all the seasons up to date and can't wait for season 10 to get released!!

B009KEN87O|5.0|I got this yesterday as the free app for the day trouble down loading on my kindle fire but was able to get it today.  It is so much fun!  Reminds me of the game I Use to play many years ago. Thankyou!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I love the game but every time you exit it deletes all your data. please fix this FGOL! Aside from that its a great game, but I've stopped playing it because of the frustration of starting over repeatedly.
B0095P3ULC|2.0|My grandson loved this toy at first sight because it was large and had the three different pieces.  However, he soon lost interest because it is extremely difficult to transform back and forth.  Even the adults could not figure it out from the diagrams.
B005NPCJ88|4.0|The album American Capitalist by Five Finger Death Punch starts out with songs that are loud and proud just the way the fans of the band have come to expect from them. I have personally spent countless hours listening to this particular album I love all of the songs. The songs get a bit softer towards the end which is why I gave four stars. I personally prefer their loud and heavy stuff more I did like track 8 however which is a slower song the title of the song is &#34;Remember Everything&#34; This song inparticular really makes you think about your life. All in all great work again FFDP keep up the great work and your fan base will follow.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This is a book is very well written with a well thought out plot and message. It is definitely worth your time to read!
B00479SVBU|5.0|I purchased this Satechi Aux MP3 player for use in my car.  My original car CD player keeps skipping when playing Audio CDs and I do not want to purchase a new car stereo.  Finally, a car MP3 player that works great.  Simple installation, Simple steps to follow.  I used a 2GB micro sandisk USB flash drive and copied over about 50 MP3 songs.  After powering up my car, the first song is already playing.  As mentioned by other users, the Satechi player has to first load to memory the song list and/or titles.  I found this out when during my first time using this player I connected a micro 16gb USB flash drive with about 1,200 MP3 songs on it.  The player spent more than 30 minutes trying to load songs and titles to memory and never did start playing my tunes.  Then I read from other customers that the memory slots were limited to 99 items, and/or using a \\"root directory\\" style of storage.  So you need to divide the songs into specific folders or have a good selection of 50 to 80 MP3 songs saved into any given folder.  Any more than 99 songs saved into the same folder or main root directory seems to lock up the player.  The main selling point for me is when playing MP3 music from a USB flash drive the sound quality is Fantastic.  There is absolutely NO radio interference, completely static and radio/noise FREE.  I highly recommend this Satechi Aux MP3 transmitter / player.  The MP3 player is setup to handle playing music from your Apple I-phone as well.  In fact, I have already purchased a second one for my wife.  She loved the sound quality in my car and wants one for herself.  Again, finally a car MP3 FM/transmitter/player worth buying.

B0034G4ORM|4.0|Good battle movie.  The only criticism is it dragged on in a few places, and was somewhat repetitive if not predictable.  But war movie lovers will love it.

B00B7Y0206|1.0|First I loved it until it stopped showing videos and only letting out the audio! It went all white and o cant watch any videos anymore! I uninstalled it 20 times!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|If you love the series this is perfect! The special features are pretty sweet too seeing all the deleted scences and what not
B006RXPUR2|2.0|I won't spoil it, but police chief Morgan Freeman and detective Ed Harris fill a giant can with manure and promise everybody it's shoeshine.  They must have each been offered 20% of profits to act in this mess.  The young private detective would have been killed several times over.  Literally every step the cops make turns out to be naive, convoluted, and self-defeating.

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This film didn't get a lot of publicity and was sorely overlooked by the Academy in my opinion. It's a strange story, but then so is life. I laughed and cried, right along with these characters!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|the movie was slow and dragging. it was dark and dull and the story didn't completely follow the book and the book was interesting.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|They did a great job brining this to the big screen.  I wasn't sure after seeing it in NY and Chicago several times but I'm a big fan.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|A must have if you are a Game of Thrones fan.  Season 2 picks up where the ground breaking 1st season left off in stellar fashion.  Not only will you be satisfied with the quality of the blue ray and DvD's.... but if your a fan of great  stories that pushes its R rating to its limit there is nothing more to talk about.  Put it in your cart NOW!
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Nice little platformer game. Isometric view and flat shading make for a sometimes confusing time of a level, but I suppose that's part of the design. Able to clear most all of the standard levels with a good rating, but some of the mechanics get brutal in the later levels.
B000000OQF|5.0|The early 1980's found Iron Maiden becoming heavy metal's savior, as the British bunch almost single-handedly helped to fend off the uprising of punk. Then, flash forward several years, and what is mostly found dominating the airwaves is dance music and pop-metal. But frontman Axl Rose and his cohorts put an end to that. See, heavy metal was definitely still around at the time (Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin pretty much invented the genre), but next-to-nobody (except for, maybe, AC-DC) sounded as dirty, dangerous, and mean as California's Guns `N' Roses.<br /><br />As a result, GNR's debut, 1987's \\"Appetite For Destruction,\\" is easily one of the best hard rock and heavy metal records of the Eighties. It is a true classic of an album, and a landmark on both of the genres' timelines. The aforementioned frontman (Rose) is heard wailing away throughout the album about various things, including all of the usual heavy metal trademarks (sex, drugs, and rock `n' roll). But his lyrics also include revolving around his own life (and the troubles with the law that he faced as an adolescent), alcohol, fears, relationships/love, and pain (both of the physical and emotional variety). But Axl's ramblings would not be nearly as effective without the virtuosic fret work of six-string aces Slash and Izzy Stradlin. Indeed, it is so easy to imagine a roomfull of air-guitarists playing along to any one of these twelve songs.<br /><br />The album's three hit singles, \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" (which features additional, guest percussion from Rose), \\"Paradise City,\\" and \\"Sweet Ol' Child Of Mine,\\" are obvious highlights. The former song finds the guitar duo effortlessly spit out gob after gob of fiery, crunchy, grooving riffs, and ascending, shredding solos for the duration of its 4.5-minute playing time. The four-stringer lays down a solid bass throb, here, too; and the number is completed by memorably catchy and wailing vocals. All of which make this charging and propulsive opening riff-fest, a feel good, party-themed anthem, and one that is so mightily infectious that the listener could even hum along to it. Next up, \\"Paradise City\\" is, well, paradise city! Need I say more? Probably not, because you almost certainly already know how great and insanely catchy this song is. But did you know that it is filled with excellent, melodic soloing and interesting, prominent bass lines that bubble up from the bottom of the mix? Lastly, the latter track is a power ballad that is filled with even more ridiculously delicious, inventive, and wailing solos. And each and every one of them is well-worth rewinding and listening to again.<br /><br />But nothing could be further from the truth than to say that those three classics are the only standouts of this bunch. \\"It's So Easy\\" is laced with sly, sleazy crooning and memorable lyrics. Indeed, in an almost Sex Pistols-esque fashion, Axl peppers this song with surprisingly colorful (read: profane) lyrics, including dropping the F bomb a couple of times. But the rest of the band aren't exactly forgettable, here, either; as they churn out good, interesting bass lines, and gobs of memorable guitar harmonies and fiery solos. But no matter how good \\"It's So Easy\\" is, it is its neighbor, \\"Nightrain,\\" that probably would have made for a better and more suitable follow up to \\"Welcome To The Jungle.\\" See, it is another outrageously catchy, Motorhead-flavored party/travel jam, and one that finds Axl wailing away memorable lines like \\"I'm on the night train\\" while Slash and Izzy rip out wonderfully winding solos and funky riffs, and Duff McKagan lays down some almost twangy-sounding bass fills. The song concludes, but not before dropping an excellent, concert-ready chorus, first.<br /><br />Working your way through the rest of the album, the succeeding \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" is highlighted by one of GNR's all-time finest, and most complex, epic, and wailing solos; and \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" is a positively funky toe-tapper with a mightily catchy, staccato beat. \\"My Michelle\\" works similarly, bolstered by another insanely rhythmic, hummable, and almost danceable guitar lick. But this reviewer cannot decide which is better in this song: The main riff, or the AC-DC-ish vocals in the choruses? Either way, \\"My Michelle\\" is a surefire, if under-appreciated classic.<br /><br />Then, following the colorful acoustic flourishes in \\"Think About You,\\" comes \\"You're Crazy,\\" a much faster, heavier, more aggressive, and riff-oriented rocker that is filled with riffage that is as great as it is catchy. A blazing solo comes ripping through the mix, here, as well. And moving on down the line, \\"Anything Goes\\" might boast funky guitar hooks, grumbling bass lines, and catchy, sing-songy vocals that get tattooed to your brain. But, again, it is the guitar solos in this song that are mostly of note, because they make inventive and tasty use of the wah-pedal. Finally, the album wraps up with \\"Rocket Queen,\\" another danceable, if laid-back jam-fest with a noteworthy bass intro.<br /><br />Guns `N' Roses would never match the level of excellence that they achieved on this, their debut, and would in fact even proceed to go on to become one of the most self-important groups in hard rock (mainly due to Axl's big head). But his (and Slash's) artistic genius shine darkly brilliant on \\"Appetite For Destruction.\\" Therefore, it is a must own for anybody that loves music.tchy, staccato beat. \\"My Michelle\\" works similarly, bolstered by another insanely rhythmic, hummable, and almost danceable guitar lick.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I have to say that I REALLY enjoyed this book and didn't want the adventure to end!  I liked the \\"journal\\" format and the way the protagonist described his precarious situations with humor.  Mr. Weir's writing style enabled me to feel like I was right there on Mars.  I am very much looking forward to reading more of Andy Weir's work.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|If you enjoy this type of movie then you will not be disappointed. I was hooked after watching season 1 and instead of subscribing to HBO purchasing the seasons as soon as they come out works best for me and then I can watch whenever I feel like it and several times if I want.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The app is entertaining to a point but it quickly looses attention because there is not a lot to do.

B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This is a very good game from Playrix.  My wife and I own all of their games on our iPads and iPhones and we buy them on the Kindle Fire for our grandson to have and play.  This game is a building game where you have been sent out by the King with a helper to help rebuild the surrounding islands of Islandshire after a devastating storm.  Every level has multiple tasks that are listed when you start the level and you can review the short list at any time.<br /><br />You have to build houses, cottages, clear the roads, collect taxes and even build up industries to help supply your needs to help build up the island.  The tax money is used to hire help, buy supplies and tools, pay for land and houses and to make upgrades or repair the homes.  If you get done in a certain amount of time you earn bonus stars that can help you get higher scores.  The game has a narrative written story and at some times it can even speak to you.  The graphics are spectacular and this is one of the things that Playrix is known for.<br /><br />Each island has multiple levels and challenges and they progressively get more involved and more difficult.  The game is an interesting and challenging game that will provide you with hours of fun and enjoyment. You are the city planner and you have to collect taxes and use them wisely to quickly accomplish the goals.  There are many islands to help and you have to keep moving.<br /><br />This version of the free game is only a sample of the whole package and it gives you two islands to work on and you should complete them in about an hour.  You then get asked to either ask for more free levels or to purchase the game.  You get more free levels by signing up for a Playrix newsletter or you have to pay $4.99 for the entire game.  There are 63 levels of the game and you can spend hours or days playing.  You can work on and visit 9 different islands and you can go back to certain levels to try to improve your score.  If you like building cities and making decisions within an app on games like this then this is one of the best.  The graphics alone make it a winner.<br /><br />Playrix makes a lot of games and they are all very nicely done.  The complete game is very good but more expensive than many other games at a price $4.99.  For a city planning game I rate this as a five star game for the graphics and story.  This version is only a teaser so just don't expect to get the entire game.  You will have about a couple of hours of enjoyment playing this sample. The game specs state that there are in app purchases but I believe that that is only to purchase the full version of the game.  On some operating systems you can also purchase enhancements to get the collector edition of the full game.<br /><br />There are a couple of negatives that you should be aware of:<br />* This is a large size game with a size of 128 MB and this may be too large for some people and their electronic devices.  It is also a problem to download something of this size via some wireless phone networks.<br />* I have a very fast and good WIFI and it took four attempts to download the game before it finally worked. I had to restart every time from zero and it probably took 25 minutes before I finally got the game loaded properly.<br /><br />I rate this as a five star game but you have to like this type of city building game.  Of all of that style of games I have played this one is by far the best.  I hope you enjoy it!decisions within an app on games like this then this is one of the best.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|I love the music of Michael Buble ! His voice is perfect. Great songs with a good quality. It's perfect form my long car rides.
B002NWXRYY|4.0|I have always though Goldie Hawn is a great comedianne and actress.  Steve Martin, even though he is pretty funny, does not compare to Goldie.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Similar to The Color Purple. Painted a very vivid and disturbing picture of the times. Couldn't put it down, had to know the tragic but satisfying ending.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|this game wont even download and I was really looking forward to it instead I got the disappointment of this game wont download
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Enjoyed Flight  great deal. A few slow downs but action or story flows right along.  Denzel gives a good performance!
B00BF11STU|4.0|great insight to the process of intel and the hunt as it must happen. the true tactics of the assault team were lacking but for the uninitiated it is fine. the real story is the process by which UBL was tracked and the methods employed and finally the guts to call the play. a real behind the scenes drama.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This film is a far cry from the pro-Obama propaganda that many conservatives were concerned it would be. Instead it has become controversial w/the liberals for its favorable treatment of the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques...which they of course call torture. While intelligence was gathered through a variety of techniques, it can be argued with some credibility that bin Laden would not have been found when he was w/out enhanced interrogation. While this is a powerful portrayal of the hunt for bin Laden - probably the best portrayal we will ever see on film - it is not for the squeamish. Torture or not, enhanced interrogation is difficult to watch; and you will hear pervasive profanity, and see explicit violence perpetrated by terrorists and our own people. If you choose not to watch it though, you will miss an outstanding espionage film and piece of our recent history; and you will miss a tour de force performance by Jessica Chastain, whose character, Maya, is patterned after a real CIA operative...the operative who is credited more than any other w/smoking out bin Laden. Katheryn Bigelow performs masterfully behind the camera...was anyone but me surprised this was directed by a woman? This movie is an outstanding example of the cinematic art.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is great! We love to play this game. Graphics are cool and it is very addictive. Game does not lock up and earning coins is easy! Be sure to use touch controls.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|My immediate reaction after watching this film in 3D...&#34;Stunning, absolutely stunning!&#34; It is a great story, compelling and powerful: part survival story, part fantasy, part animal psychology...and all in glorious 3D visual artistry. It is also the story of faith; although the protagonist, Pi Patel's approach to God is an ambiguous one, in that he espouses the Hindu, Christian and Islamic faiths. At one point his father says, &#34;following multiple faiths is no faith at all!&#34;; and I would agree, but somehow Pi's simplicity of faith is believable. While the lion's (or Tiger's) share for the excellence of this film - my opinion - should go to Ang Lee, the performance by 17 year old Suraj Sharma, in his film debut, as Pi Patel, should not be overlooked. It is in many ways a masterful performance, not often attained by experienced actors twice or three times his age. The CGI/special effects, which like the cast, is international in scope, is also a wonder to behold...even if you do not care for the story, the visuals make the movie worth watching. And the story...look for a twist at the end that will likely surprise you.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Enjoy playing this classis game  However, you will want to get full version to play more levels.  Play controls are good more mobile phone app.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|Old Bilbo: &#34;My dear Frodo, you asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures. While, I can honestly say I've told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.&#34; And so begins the story of Bilbo Baggins' unexpected journey. While this is a superb fantasy with absolutely stunning visuals, it does not measure up to the standards set by the &#34;LOTR Trilogy&#34;. Having read J. R. R. Tolkien's &#34;The Hobbit&#34; upon which this first of another trilogy is based, I believe I understand why it doesn't quite measure up. The book is about a third the length of Tolkein's LOTR masterpiece...and in my opinion there is just not enough material for three movies of the length of this one. But having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the film; and it is only in comparison to the original trilogy that it doesn't measure up. Ian McKellan is again Gandolph and delivers another masterful performance; and Martin Freeman as the young Bilbo Baggins also performs masterfully. The Dwarves are new characters with new actors portraying them; but in addition to McKellan, you will see many familiar faces...Ian Holm, Elijah Wood, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving and Andy Serkis. And to top it off, Peter Jackson is back as director. Pluses greatly outweigh the minuses; and I have no problem recommending this film highly.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Worth the money. This was a great buy. Does everything it was promised to. Great on any touch screen device.
B007SGM084|5.0|The series was recommended by my daughter who could not put it down and once I started reading it had the same effect on me. It was captivating from beginning to end.<br /><br />Due to its graphic content I would definitely recommend it for a mature audience.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Awesome game!  Brings back fond memories of the times of Space Invaders (Donkey Kong and Asteroids).  Times of the challenging yet uncomplicated games.  Thanks.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I'm seeing a lot of &#34;Watch Guy&#34; reviews (I didn't even know that was a thing). I guess those are good for other &#34;Watch Guys&#34; who know what the difference between 21 jewels and 23 jewels... I don't. What I do know is that this is a nice watch at a decent price. I've worn it for a bit over a week and it's still accurate when I compare it to the time on my phone which is connected to a time server through some sort of dark magic. One of the &#34;Watch Guys&#34; suggested that had something to do with the number of jewels and the country in which those jewels were produced. Japanese products made in Malaysia? Sure, whatever, I'll believe it. All I know is the time is still correct and I'll never have to change the battery because of the little swingy weight thing in the back.<br /><br />Is it comfortable? Absolutely. The band is canvas (as per the listing title) and it doesn't catch any of the hair on my wrist. It's gotten a bit wet when I wash my hands and it dries pretty quickly, it's slightly less comfortable when it's wet but it doesn't stay that way for long. Another nice feature that is difficult to see are the two retainers for the excess band. I have a really skinny wrist and usually when I get any sort of a fabric band the usual single retainer for the excess is just more fabric which invariably breaks leaving me with 2 inches of watch band that sticks out at a weird angle and does a great job of looking stupid. This watch has two metal retainers. One is fixed in place near the clasp and the other can be moved up and down the remaining band. They're sized just right so they don't let the band slip and they stay in position.<br /><br />Speaking of size, the watch face is ideal for the skinny wristed. The vast majority of watches look like a wall clock on my arm, they're stupidly big. This guy is about as big a watch I can wear before they start looking goofy on me. It's a bit taller than I would like but that's the price you pay for a purely mechanical system.<br /><br />This watch is a solid buy. I'd recommend it to anybody who wants a reasonably priced mechanical watch for casual wear.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|I never get tired of watching this movie. Now it's even better in 3D. I will watch forever and ever
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. It captured the social structure and struggles of the era so well. The characters were so well defined that I could almost &#34;watch&#34; them as the story unfolded. If you enjoy this period in history then this is definitely a book you should read. I also appreciate that it could be read by just about any age group. No racy parts. I would easily recommend it to anyone. A word of caution: don't pick it up unless you have time to devote to reading....it's hard to put down.

B00A85EMVK|5.0|I bought this movie for the sole purpose of the 3d transfer.  I had read good reviews of it and the transfer is outstanding!<br />I have a Epson pro projector shooting onto a 120 screen and the 3d-ness was very good throughout the entire movie.<br />Now I'm waiting for the 3d transfer of Star Wars, I cannot help to think the Star Wars transfer will be incredible.<br />Other 3d movies I like we're originally 3d, so this was the first transfer I've seen.

B00258SS72|5.0|This is an amazing movie from start to finish.  It opens your eyes and presents you with almost shocking ethnocentric views of the world.  The story development was so well done that I was on the edge of my seat until the end.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|i thought it was time to see what all the fuss was about.  i don't subscribe to any premium cable channels, so i'm a little late to the &#34;homeland&#34; game.  the premise of the show sounded intriguing to me, and i had a feeling i would like this show.  i was blown away.  let's put it this way, i watched all of season one in a day.  believe me, i had NO plans to do so.  both main characters are flawed and believable.  the plot twists...mental illness...terrorism....trust...disappointment...IT'S ALL GREAT.<br />so much of what's on television and in the movies is soooo awful.  this is an adult show with great characters and most importantly, great writing.  this show deserves all the accolades and awards it gets.  so worth your while.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|Nice edition of a camp classic! My Dad took my brother and I to see this when it played in the theater. It's one of the goofiest, silliest movies I have ever seen...and I love it. A hokey, hammy masterpiece. Great music by Queen doesn't hurt either.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. I had a Hard time putting it down. It kept me wanting to read more and find out what was gonna happen next. Looking forward to the next book.  Thank you for the suspense.

1439153663|5.0|Being a &#34;damned Yankee&#34; (as my latte husband referenced me since I'm in the south to stay) the happenings in this book were very disturbing. I had a very sheltered youth upbringing and did not even know any people of color until I went to jr high. There were none in my hometown until after I had left home at 21. I have a great deal of difficulty accepting that these things happened but know from history accounts that they did. Very interesting reading, got me all riled up wanting to take on some of the characters.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Did not work with Kindle Fire, as promised. Took forever to download and wouldn't install. I was not happy with this app.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|My expectation for this season was probably too high, but I didn´t feel the thrill of the first season, sorry.
B000002IQW|5.0|While skid rows self-titled debut is a enjoyable piece of hair metal history it can not hold a candle to there next release slave to the grind. And the comparison is unavoidable because while the self-titled debut had enjoyable songs with little substance for the most part slave to the grind is a whole different beast. Songs like in a darkened room,quicksand jesus and wasted time are some of the very best rock ballads you will ever hear. While the rest of the songs are some of the best hard rock songs ever written and certainly the best skid row has ever written. Bachs vocals are at there very best here. The only downfalls for me being the songs physco love and creep show.
B00006JIA4|3.0|I was expecting Queen hits on all 3 albums. Unfortunately, they're only on the first one. Oh well. Guess I can just toss the 2nd & 3rd, especially for the price.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very cute little game.  My son and I both enjoy it. Much easier than having a real horse. Would tell friends to get it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a nice relaxing game of Bingo. There are many levels that you can climb to. When toy think you are out of coins you hit a bonus ad continue on. You can join in on the chat or play alone.

B004FQX59I|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone!! It is very informative and really opens your eyes about what all happened.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|What I mean by that is this book has only certain characters in it. The next book has the rest of the characters that were not in a feast of crows. If you truly love this story and George r.r. Martin then you can overlook the lack of the rest of the characters.

B000HA4WT8|5.0|it is great to watch all of these cars and people getting to ride and get to live the life on the edge
B002GHIPYI|5.0|pros: this is a great headphone at a low price with great quality. comfortable to wear.<br />cons: the appearance is not so great.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I had heard that this may have been their best video and it surely didn't disappoint<br />either my wife or me since we're both huge Eagles fans.  And being in BluRay only<br />made it better.  Great camera work and the SurroundSound was awesome!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|me and my friends sit and play this game all day it fun and challenging. When I first got the game I thought it was OK but when I accurately found out it was good I found myself playing it for hours at a time.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Great analogy to that little town in Greenland/Iceland and how a good economy<br />can head south rather quickly when corruption happens upon the scene.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Again in the third book of the series I find myself riveted through most of the book, the emotional struggles Katniss goes through are relate-able if not heart breakingly honest. As with the first two however, the ending fizzled, leaving me feeling like an emotional unresolved mess, I thought the little future glimpse at the end was a stretch to find an ending to an otherwise brilliant book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game subway surfer is a great game. I think that this is a great game for people who like temple run, because subway surfer is just like it. Thanks for making such a great game.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Awesome retro game, not too hard if you don't want it to be. I love the invincible power up, pretty creative.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love playing this game.  very nice graphics and I like that I can use the tilt function!  can't. get enough!
B004EF4J40|5.0|A simply must-see period drama!  I have read the book this movie is based on, and would like to say that except for the minimization of the heroine's vibrant Christian faith, I find the changes made by the filmmakers to the characters and plot to be \\"most welcome\\" (as Margaret Hale would say).  Superb acting, characters with depth, and a beautiful soundtrack combine to make an experience that will stay with you long after the film has ended.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I did like it but it was hard to keep up with the stories and people. It was very very slow reading.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I loved Skyfall. It has all the traditional Bond story things like great action, terrible trouble, and a scary bad guy (really creepy). It also developed the characters in a way that I haven't seen in Bond movie before. The character development really improved the movie. I loved this one.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|What can I say,every American has heard about Tom Sawyer and it is a great story. It is a shame that some schools have removed this book from their libraries because of the N word. However, vulgar rap artist are praised in America 's dumb-down culture  by the youth.
B002KDSBGA|4.0|I watched the video before I read the book.  This made me look for things in the book. The actors in the movie were well chosen for the characters they played.  The only drawback to the video is I rented it from Amazon to play on my Roku; I don't know why it happened, but about 3/4 of the way through the movie, it just froze.  After re-setting the Roku, and waiting several minutes, the movie came back, and I was able to resume the movie at the point where it froze.  Don't know if it was the fault of the Roku or my internet connection.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|It reads very well an  is broken down in a easy to understand system. The content was useful and reliable. I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to anyone who is in a manager position or has authority in their work place because it helped me greatly in the business I am in as a restaurant manager. It helps you learn to talk to your employees and get positive results with doing so. And you can also use these skills in the real world as well, I do in College.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best animal app in the history of the word I love it so much totally get it it is great
B0078X2LKY|5.0|An absolute favourite when I was a little girl and both my boys love it just as much. Fantastic really.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing and it is fun to &quot;learn&quot; how to care for a horse. I love it<br />I enjoy going on it everyday to play
0446547573|5.0|Fabulous book. I would definitely recommend this! Easily probably one of my favorite novels by Nicholas Sparks. If you're thinking about getting it, do yourself a favor and do it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I don't honestly use a dictionary much, but this has been helpful every time i needed it. If your mobile device has a microphone you can say the word and the dictionary will look it up. It isn't perfect, but most of the time it will get the word your looking for, it also has synonyms, antonyms, origins, and it shows you how the word is used in a sentence.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|I am a big fan of St. Vincent's and David Byrne's other works. I was pretty psyched to hear that they were collaborating, and more than willing to buy the album Love This Giant before hearing a single track on it. I am into all sorts of contemporary music and I have a high threshold for weird, which is no doubt helpful with this one. It was hard to make sense of this album at first- there's a lot of ideas on packed onto it (like any great album, it grows on the listener over time, what sounds at first like strange gobbleygook today may sound perfectly sensible tomorrow). There's horns on just about every track; they went all out with the horns, which is not to say that their vocal and guitar sensibility goes to waste. There's plenty of room for sound, with chord progressions and synchopations that I'm sure we've all come to expect from the likes of them. Oh, and it's very heavy on electronic drums, which may often be a bad sign, but they make it work.<br />  So, with fun lyrical concepts and sonic moods that run the gamut from playful to moody to dark, with a good deal of singing done by both of our friends, and most songs being written cooperatively (by both of them), Love This Giant shows that St. Vincent and David Byrne bring out each other's strengths. It is very much in keeping, I think, with the values they've displayed individually. Standouts for me include Who, Lazarus, and I Am An Ape.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I think,by-far, that this is Josh Grobans' finest album to date.  I recommend that anyone who wants to get lost in thought or wants a good meditation album, this is it.
B001UAX56A|3.0|I only liked a few of the songs on this one I like to be able to sing with the song some are kind of hard to understand.
B009KEN87O|4.0|The Game Is Fun. Had An Old School Arcade Feel. Can Learn With out Reading Any Directions Which Is Good For Most Guys.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed the first book but this one was even better.  Can't wait to start the next one.  It was nice to find out why he is so messed up.  I was so glad that Mrs. Robinson got told off.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Im still reading the book. I like the book the television series is very accurate. I will continue the series of books. Would definitely recommend  gives you more insight to what does happen on the television series. Overall good read :)
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though I was familiar with this story and knew the outcome since it is part of our history,  this movie held the drama and suspense of those times.  I was at the edge of my seat watching it.  Well done and  kudos to all who brought it to the  screen!  The Oscar was well deserved.
B007MAETA8|5.0|It's hard to admit this since I'm a huge Eric Clapton fan and I love everything Kenny Wayne Shepherd does, but I think this is my favorite album of all time from anyone. I wasn't even a huge fan of John Mayer until I heard this album. I knew he was a great guitar player and all, but the songs I'd hear on the radio were always more pop sounding. Guess what, now I like those too. I wanted to go back and listen to his other music that I never gave a fair shot to. This is an amazing folk/Rock album. I usually either love folk music or not. This is great. There was one song I wasn't crazy about at first which was Walt Grace's Submarine song, but it grew on me. It's funny how music can do that to you. I can't point out any highlights b/c like I said, I love every song. If you like the song \\"Who Says\\" from Battle Studies or \\"Stop this Train\\" from Continuum, then you will like this album. That's more along the lines of the sound you should expect to hear.
B00B7IJDMA|2.0|I only like a couple songs off this album after all..  I would recommend just purchasing the MP3's that you like.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Very happy 10-year-old kiwi boy! I'm officially the 'best mum in the world' for managing to find this and get it over from the other side of the world.<br /><br />Thank you to all involved!
B007DIQC90|4.0|I really like this group, the whole album is fun to listen to. There are no real bad songs on it.
B007Z1FD7M|2.0|Image quality: Main reason for low rating is that about half of the footage is out of focus.  I can tell that most of the cameras were unattended and set to \\"auto-focus\\", but like any dimly lit environment, the cameras didn't have anything to focus on and you just see foggy silouhettes half of the time.  I don't normally care about quality of footage, but this one was particularly bad. I'll chalk it up to cheap cameras from a long long time ago, compounded by having some or most of them unmanned.<br /><br />Sound quality: Acceptable<br /><br />Artistic value: Very good, I enjoy seeing any show from this period, THRAK is an album I really admire and enjoy.  Very similar to Discipline in overall appeal to me.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL has strong echoes of other 'British-in-India' films, most notably HEAT AND DUST and A PASSAGE TO INDIA. A group of British pensioners decide to spend their last days - exactly why is not made quite clear - in a rundown hotel in Jaipur.  Some of them learn to adapt to new ways of life; others find it difficult, if not impossible.  John Madden's film emphasizes the importance of learning how to listen and look, especially when living in another culture.  On occasions the film resorts to crude stereotyping to make its point: Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) comes across as the well-meaning yet inefficient hotelier, while Penelope Wilton's Jean Ainslie remains a total snob throughout, believing that India lacks the 'civilized' aspects of Britain.  By contrast Judi Dench's Evelyn Greenslade is a masterpiece of understatement, as she discovers things about herself that she could never have found while in England.  Ronald Pickup's Norman Cousins realizes that he retains sexual energy, while Tom Wilkinson's Graham Dashwood comes to terms with his past.  While the film ends with a rather banal voiceover informing us about how age is no barrier to self-discovery, it is nonetheless entertaining to watch.
B000002VMD|5.0|so glad to have the soundtrack---bought the movie and decided I must have the soundtrack as well---do not regret it at all----such a voice!!!
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I really liked the song &#34;hold on&#34;. I haven't connected with any of the other songs yet. I think the lead singer sounds like Janis Joplin
B00447L4KA|5.0|Another great 1990s Shakespeare movie. Love Hedger & Stiles. Gordon-Levitt & Oleynik are pretty good. Krumholtz always plays an entertaining bit character. If you enjoy the 90s fad of turning Shakespeare comedies into movies, you'll like this one.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this record. I love every song. My three year old loves &#34;Lonely Boy&#34; and begs me to play it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I like the game and its fun but the sharks are expensive. But its still fun!what do you think?it's fun
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I enjoyed it, except for Indian Ashram segment, which dragged. But for most part it was a fun book to read. I related to it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Absolutely loved this story. Great character portrayals, plot twist and a sense that decisions are not always easy to make, and do belong to the decider.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Truly an interesting and brilliant man!  Talk about a legacy.  If you're an Apple fan I definitely recommend reading this book.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Great show. Great characters. Great writing. Great music. Great acting. Visually lush. A soap opera for the upper crust, and at a time-warping pace. A must-see for anyone that can pay close attention and apply a little brain. There are a lot of characters to keep track of.
B004U52VPS|4.0|My 3 year old loves this game. Mommy on the other hand hates cleaning up afterwards! I hate legos too though (haha). Sort of a jenga type set up where you pull cards that tell you how to build up your tower and place your pigs, and then you knock down the tower with the birds. Gets a little monotonous doing essentially the same thing over and over. But the kid loves it so thats all that matters!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed this book...kept getting better and better as it went on, wish it hadn't ended quite the way that it did.....
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Same formula as the others in the series, but it hasn't been played out yet. I grew up with the original toys and series, and enjoy this reboot.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this as part of a bundle with a camera and a few lenses.  It holds everything wonderfully, and the construction is great.  It's a little awkward to use as a backpack because the interior is more rigid, but it works great as a case.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My three  yr old and  I are enjoying this game together. She likes \\"helping\\" me with the horses. This is a fun way to pass time when necessary.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is my first Colleen Hoover book, and now I LOVE her. She really had me invested in Holder and Sky. I laughed at their banter, and cried when they cried. It flowed very well, and I felt like things were dealt with in the story in a way I can relate to. This book talks about some very heavy topics, but the book wasnt so consumed by it that you couldnt appreciate the love story for what it was. After reading this book, I want to read more from Mrs. Hoover. The reason why it wasnt 5 stars is because I feel like so much happened in the end that I wanted more time reading about. I felt like there could be a book two \\"after high school\\".
B008GVD6D8|4.0|It was a gripping storyline and and the twist at the end was brilliant. Such unconditional love between the characters
0743277465|5.0|If you have within you the drive to be excellent, to reach the top of whatever field you are in, you will find this book to be an amazing source of both wisdom and common sense that you have likely never heard before, expressed in a way that anyone with a mind open to instruction can understand. Who would have thought that chess and martial arts have so much in common, and that at the core all types of competition require the same type of focus, concentration, intuition, and mental self-discipline to learn and do what it takes to become the best of the best? And best of all, the book is an easy read and valuable help for anyone who wants to improve their level of performance regardless of their current occupation or circumstances. Get this book and read it before you shell out hundreds or even thousands of dollars to the self-help &#34;gurus!&#34;
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love the writing style of the author. The story line is gripping from the start. I found myself feeling all the emotions that the characters were feeling and I shed a few tears along with them. Brilliant book.
B003XE1DR4|3.0|I ordered black and was sent brown! the bag they were in says black but the crocs have a tag with Expresso and thats the color!
034580404X|4.0|I fell into the hype over these books after my girlfriend said let's read it.  They didn't have the same effects on me as they did some of my female friends.  I enjoy well written literature that keeps my attention, so if you haven't read them you're missing out.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is one of the happiest movies I've seen in a LONG time.  I enjoy and keep enjoying this movie over and over.  I'm glad I got it.
B00A8V3VVG|4.0|I don't like the quotes from the movie interspersed throughout the tracks. When i want to watch the movie, I'll watch the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|man oh man this app is so cool it is like temple run or rail rush. I do not know any better app than this.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|I don't have anything to say that I'm sure hasn't been already said.  It's one of my top 10 shows and still being on TV this long and counting in my opinion says &#34;Hey We're on quite a few top 10 lists and that says it all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun. I just wish it was easier to earn gems. I love horses. I'm only doing this review to dean gems.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|The kids don't even realize they are learning. To them it's just a game. They ask to play it all the time!
B00008J2PG|5.0|Best movie for learning more about WWII ... It teach us a lot about the people that helped save others ...
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This has been one of my favorite reads of all time.  I always have to pick it up and re read it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is fun, from feeding, brushing, training, treating, and competing.  Kids always wanted horses, now they get to see the time and effort you must spend on them including cost.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|Its just a typical match three game. I don't understand people who say it has a great storyline.  It doesn't have a story line at all. Every 8 or so boards they will throw up a couple of pics from the book storyline, but that's it. They could have made the same game without the pics and noone would have ever noticed.  As far as the game play....it sucks.  The meter recharges so slowly that it might as well be non-existant.  I think ifI a going to play a game like this,I'l stick to bejeweled or call of atlantis.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app lets me know when to recharge love it. Would like to recommend this application thanks so much Amazon...
B00006AW63|5.0|When this came out it was released that Glenn Close auditioned more than once fighting for the part of Cruella De Ville<br />And Disney pulled off what seemed like hundreds of adorable pups ALLOver the place. The villains are hilarious..House star and the Red headed father of the
0439023513|3.0|My least favorite out of the three. Characters lacked the depth that they originally had in the first two. Parts of the book seemed dry and rushed. The overall ending was well written, however, I believe she could have done better in other areas.
B009A87X80|5.0|Eva Cassidy had one of the clearest natural gorgeous voices I have ever heard....effortless, smokey,<br />Lilting, and at times as earthy as possible. she was incredible. Eva Cassidy died in 1996 before she reached any notoriety...but her voice lives on thanks to her family keeping a great collection of her signature songs<br />Which constitute this album. Buy it...you will be blown away listening to her beautiful voice . RIP Eva<br />You are missed!
B000SEH80I|5.0|Although this book does not address one specific form of abuse, it was very insightful on the emotional effects that take place. It addresses how toxic parents effect their child's self-beliefs and view of the world; most of which are carried into adulthood. Very helpful on dealing with emotional and relational issues that can result from toxic parenting.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I've tried downloading 3 times, but won't install on my kindle fire hd 8.9. My kindle is not rooted or modified in any way.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed the descriptive approach as it made me think I was there in the middle of it all. Almost like you cold smell the blood, the dirt and the sky. Loved it!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I always loved this app, but typing out was not my style. Thanks to flow, all is right again. Is a bit slow at times to close out when I hit home within an app, otherwise would be 5 stars.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Loving the retro feel &amp; look, too.  What I like most, however, is how the devs were able to take an old idea, &amp; despite all the graphical muscle &amp; complex gameplay of current games, made something equally addictive...well done!
B0074VA2T2|4.0|Very repetitive. Helps preschoolers learn to count! My kids ask to play this game! I would recommend getting this app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that they have so many translations to choose from. It is also so nice to have the Bible read to you while you are reading it. Sometimes when i am reading my mind tends to wander. This way of doing it keeps me focused.
B008I3RARW|3.0|Running on a SGS3 - ok graphics, decent play...but the motion controls are a bit touchy, causing one to spin out on a regular basis. Uninstalled.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|Awesome! I just got a free card code for iTunes from freeitunesforever[dot]com<br />You can too!  Just go to the site
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of Thrones = Awesome<br /><br />Streaming without filling up my hard drive = Five Stars of Awesome<br /><br />Blah blah blah (that was to reach my minimum word count)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is the best book ever! So romantic and the details are well put together. Totally suggest you read it. For ages 10 and up.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|is so fun and better than the first one! I mean its so cool! I will never delete it because its free and the first one os to but the first ones lame to.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This story allows an ordinary person to get a true and accurate account of the life of a true hero.  The account is objective and told by heroes themselves..Adam Brown is a throwback role model..he was at the very core selfless and Fearless.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I love every book of hers that I have read thus far. She grabs me at the beginning and doesn't release me until the end! Wonderful book and an amazing writer.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|Amazing gift for fellow Zelda fans! Extremely good collectible as well as making normal card games more interesting. This is definitely a must-have.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Beautiful Darkness took on a more mysterious and adventurous tone than the first book. The amount of boyfriend and girlfriend drama was a bit predictable and bothersome, but that's just my personal thought. Overall it's a decent book.
1616550414|5.0|This book was so great! The designs are gold and shiny, and everything in here was so interesting and informative. This is a must-have for anyone into Zelda games.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Though it was tough reading an entire book without my favorite characters, this book certainly brought the story along. This seemed like a novel meant to really flesh out the story and let the reader see what's going on from different angles. I highly recommend this series as a whole, and it wouldn't be complete without this addition!
1451695195|5.0|Required reading for all those skeptics.  Story is well told and believeable as well as having a rather surprise at the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've had this game on my kindle for an hour and I'm completely addicted. About to run out of battery life lol
B00992CF6W|4.0|the game is sweet but in creative mode there isnt flint and steel so no booooommmmm yes its cool but please flint and steelin creative mode  pppplllleeeeeaaaaassssseeee
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this app is yes it is yes very nice quite lovely ya very very not just kidding it very nice
B0083Z614S|5.0|I thought it was a great book. I loved everything about the book I wish I would have read it in high school like I was suppose to.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun mystery to solve. Graphics are beautifully done and spooky. Great to include the hint button. Enjoyed this game very much!
0345803485|1.0|After hearing all the hoopla about this book I decided to check for myself. My wife teased me because she said it was a book for women and I'm a manly kinda guy. I figured I could learn a thing or two about what women want (even one of our closest lady friends admitted to reading this book 9 times!) I should have heeded my gut after reading the first chapter and stopped right there. Good grief! The adjectives I can use to describe the writing \\"skill\\" of the author are sophomoric, adolescent, juvenile, immature, childish, etc. Against my better judgement, I kept reading until I had had enough. I can't see why anyone would give this book any praise at all.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but read about 5 books a week ( basically never without a mystery) I bought this at a drugstore on impulse and I LOVED it!! It kept me reading through the night and full of surprises! I'm a new fan!
B00B99KJR0|3.0|This is fun but kind of mindless entertainment. Im sure theres a strategy behind it somewhere. I dont really see the purpose of the story, though.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was suspenseful with many twists and turns. I was thinking about these characters for days after finishing the book.
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|Since brevity is the soul of wit, I'll be brief. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was when I heard this. There is only on or two (maybe three) memorable songs here. Considering it has been 10 years since Bowie's last release, I find myself very disappointed indeed.
B000FC10MU|5.0|What an innovative idea. A great story, captivatingly written.  I love it when I can see the story in my mind.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|My five year old son loves this game.  He was able to quickly learn the basics of moving around and shooting, and has been playing it for about 3 days straight.  Might be a little too simplistic for adults.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is so easy to use and gives me the info I need to dress for the day and what to anticipate on my commute<br />to work ie how much snow etc. So much better than trying to get same info on TV. Would recommend to anyone!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Good controls. Many levels and stages. Can kill hours of time and is a great all around game. Must get!
B002UAJ0BS|5.0|This item completely met my expectations. With this product being pressed on 180 gram black it gave the album that full studio sound that I was anticipating. Purchase this masterpiece of an album on vinyl today!
B003O86FMW|5.0|To see this movie. This book was great. It's a turn pager.....keeps you wanting to read more. Now it's time to read book # 3
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This is just a freak show! A really good, solid scary movie. The plot is familiar, but it is played out really well with some unexpected twists and turns. Same director as Insidious, and you can really feel it here. Really good scary movie! 5 stars!
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|This album Definitely has a unique sound. Real love most of the songs but some are a little strange. Happy with my purchase.
B006RXQ800|3.0|Well, this is the only movie where i really like cameron diaz. She is actually pretty cool in this one, not her usual flaky slut role. It was good. I think if i watched it again i would prolly like it better. There is just such a long, long history with so many different gangs  its a little hard to follow in one sitting. Definitely one of those movies you need to watch twice to really put everything together. Very long though, like 2 1/2 hours.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows can't wait for season 3 to be available to watch ,cant wait to see what happens next,<br />I'm so addicted
B00B23O96A|5.0|Clapton just plays what he wants to play<br />These are great songs, and he makes them better<br />If you prefer the Cream and Dominoes style, this is not for you<br />If you want great playing this is it

B00B671VYU|4.0|Lordi's new album is yet another attempt at the band trying to find their sound. Granted, with having to replace two members, this was inevitable. I would compare this much more to \\"Deadache\\" than their other albums, though I do think it's an overall better album than \\"Deadache.\\" They've moved away from the in-your-face-metal that made albums like \\"Get Heavy,\\" \\"The Arockalypse,\\" and, my personal favorite, \\"Babez For Breakfast\\" awesome. This album is much more keyboard-driven, and comes off sounding more like Gothic metal than their other material. Alice Cooper came to mind a lot while I was listening to this.<br /><br />Now, whether you enjoy that or not will be what makes you decide to buy this album. Personally, even though I liked the majority of the songs on here, it's not one I intend to pick up right away. It just doesn't sound like an album I'd want to listen to all the time. I don't even mind that it's a slower and less-heavy album than their past work. It just wasn't a home run like I felt \\"Babez\\" was.<br /><br />Plus there were a couple of songs (\\"The Riff\\" and \\"Sincerely With Love\\") that I felt were a little out of character for Lordi...lyrically speaking. I never thought I'd ever hear Mr. Lordi talking like a stoner (\\"I'm sorry dude, I'm kinda busy...\\"), or start dropping F-bombs in a song. For someone who is such a huge KISS fan, I didn't think he would want to go this route. Up until that point I would have considered Lordi a fairly kid-friendly band...even if they might seem a little scary to them.<br /><br />I give the album 4 out of 5 stars because this isn't bad, but I expected a lot better. Normally I'd give it 3 stars, but with all they went through in making this, I'll give them a little slack. Favorite songs were: \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes,\\" \\"Horrifiction,\\" and \\"Candy For the Cannibal.\\"
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this one too! Christian Grey is every young girls fantasy!  If only we all could have that life and meet our dream man! lol
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great fun for all ages.  The music could be a bit more interesting.  Maybe some vaiations on the these.  Might make the game more interesting.  Love the animal & bird sounds intergrated in the game.

B001R4MEUM|5.0|While the recording of the original left a lot to be desired, the transfer was significantly better. Combine the incredible storytelling and writing of Peter Gabriel with the talent and cohesiveness of Phil, Mike and Tony and you have possibly the greatest progressive rock experience of all time!
B0018OASUO|4.0|These guys really did probably appear to be from another planet for the lucky few in the US who saw this tour back in 72.  There wasn't an American band playing balls out rock that could touch The Spiders from Mars (not counting the Stooges if they were still performing.  I can't think of anyone else who would be in this ballpark)  Technically this isn't a great recording, not a lot of dynamics in the sound, but it's a great raw warts and all document of an outstanding rock and roll band hitting its stride.  I like this better than the official Ziggy tour LP RCA released on the 80's.  Band is hotter and the song selection better.  &#34;Waiting For The Man&#34; is worth the price of admission alone.  I have the vinyl edition - obviously some TLC went into this design and layout.

B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I really did enjoy this movie. I wasn't too sure about Shia, but I didn't mind him in this part. It actually suited him. I loved Tom Hardy, of course. Jason Clarke and Jessica Chastain both did well. I wanted to see more of Howard because I like that kind of crazy in a character. And I've read several places that the roles of Jessica and Mia were contrived and a waste and the people who wrote the reviews didn't see the point of those characters. Without spoiling it for others, I thought they were very important to the story. This is based on real people and their lives. It may have been \\"Hollywood-ized\\" but the basic elements are still there, including why these characters were in the movie. I think these days people think WAY too much into things and can't just enjoy a story. Oh, and Gary Oldman and Guy Pearce are always a treat. Love them. If you haven't seen Tom Hardy in Warrior you should. Like, right now. And Jessica in Jolene. It's not an easy movie to watch due to the nature of it, but that girl has range.

0425263908|2.0|I must admit that I love reading new books of authors, discovering the new talents of writing, I enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey, but Bared To You by Silvia Day was to similar to Fifty Shades, many of the examples that I give are obvious, like having a roommate, just starting a new job, being possessive, the names such as Taylor, the eye colors where Christian (Fifty Shades) eyes were grey, Ms. Tremall eyes are grey, Gideon eyes are blue as of Anastasia (Fifty Shades).  I actually laughed as I read Bared To You because of the similarity and I thought, \\"are you kidding me?\\".  Overall the writing was good, but wished the author brought her own originality to the story, I still prefer the Fifty Shades of Grey to Bared To You.  If you read Fifty Shades of Grey you will see the difference.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|screen did not stay glued and glue in places it shouldnt be as well as the little plastic piece that turns volume wasnt attached and so i couldnt change from vibrate to sound
B001202VDQ|5.0|As many other reviews have stated--even if you're not a fan of the somewhat cliche growling vocals, this band has a breadth and texture that few other bands can demonstrate. In a time where pop and club music rules the charts this is pure, technical, and brutal metal. It has dynamics that switch from fast to slow to dark to light multiple times per song. I highly recommend listening from start to finish--the songs complement one another so well that one feels almost as if they are on a journey. If you liked Blackwater Park you will love this--at least I did. I originally downloaded the mp3s and once I heard it I instantly came to Amazon and purchased the mp3s--who says downloading isn't good for the artist???
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was utterly ashamed & sickened when I read how &#34;starving&#34; instead of wealthy, H. Howey is by self-report, after publishing ONLY Silo 1- 5! I consider myself a near &#34;professional&#34; Sci-Fi & Fantasy genre reader with MANY hundreds of read and re-read books in my collection. Just completed Silo 1-5 and as a practicing psychologist, I must say Howey's grasp on the group dynamics of, &#34;How good people, with good intentions, more often than not [via the unimaginably complex & conflicting interaction of cognitive dissonance, self-preservation vs. doing what is morally right, among 100's of other powerful forces] result in &#34;good&#34; people not only doing monstrous things to their fellow man...but worse, coming to believe in the &#34;rightness&#34; of those twisted/evil actions as justified! Silo is an awesome book. But more than that, it brutally forces us to look in the mirror...at what under the right conditions any of us might do.
B0064MT1FI|5.0|Seeing this movie on dvd was astonishing!  Loved the beautiful scenery of New Zealand.  The actors was fantastic, romantic and exotic.

1616202416|5.0|Chimamanda Adiche's novel Purple Hibiscus describes the deterioration of an abusive father and his family against the backdrop of the collapse of Nigerian society as it endures a military coup. The story is very well written and the character development is intriguing and captivating to read. In a way this is a coming of age story that shows the development of an abused girl who learns how to take care of herself against all odds. The story is seen through the eyes of the fourteen-year old daughter Kambili Achike, who is very insecure due to the strict conditions her father forces her to live under. She originally believes the physical and emotional abuse her father Eugene inflicted upon her, her brother Jaja, and her mother were normal gestures of love, but as she grows so does her understanding of what her father really is and how damaging his behavior has been toward her and her family. His abuse was so hostile at times that he kicked Kambili to the point where she needed to be hospitalized and poured boiling hot water onto Kambili and Jaja's feet.<br />Kambili is often misunderstood because her fear is her motivation in life. She lacks awareness and self-identity and as a result is often times lost or confused. She turns to education to try and make sense of the world around her. Her peers and even her cousin see her as a privileged snob, but really she is very sheltered and naïve. As the political and socio-economic systems collapse so does the life Kambali knew and she goes to visit her aunt Ifeoma. The lifestyle is such a drastic change from anything Kambili is used to.  Ifeoma's home is loving and free-spirited, but does not have the wealth Kambili is used to. Instead she is cared for and nurtured and finds a new strength within herself. At this time we see Kambili transform into a more independent young woman who is learning to assert herself and take charge of her life. With the help of her aunt, Father Amadi, and Amaka, Kambili begins to find herself andcomes to realize that her father is not the upstanding pillar of the community she once believed him to be.<br />Unlike Kambili, her brother Jaja is much more outspoken and independent from the beginning though it is clear that the abuse and harsh upbringing has affected him emotionally and physically. In fact, his decision to ignore the request of his father to go to the Communion is referred to as \\"the beginning of the end.\\" This marks a major turning point in the novel because for the first time Eugene does not hold all the power in his family. I admire Jaja for having the courage to stand up to his father knowing the punishment could be devastating, but fighting for his freedom anyway. In a lot of ways he might be the strongest character in the novel.<br />I really liked the contrast between the family setting and the hostile environment plaguing Nigeria. The way Adiche blends the two settings sheds a unique light on each situation. In a way they feed off each other. The conflict puts families like Kambili's in danger, while families feed the conflict going on around them by adding to the destabilization of Nigerian society. Though they live in a post-colonial society it is clear that colonialism had a deep impact on Nigeria and Kambili's family. Her father is a fanatical Catholic who uses religion to justify his actions, but there is no justification for what he's done.<br />Adiche is brilliant and a fantastic writer, which can be seen when reading Purple Hibiscus. I also suggest reading Adiche's The Thing Around Your Neck if you enjoyed reading this one.

B009KHBDUU|5.0|Knowing the interesting slants that both Johnny Depp and Tim Burton bring to all their projects and being a huge fan of the original series, I wasn't really sure what to expect from this film. I have to say I wasn't disappointed with either Burton's vision or Depp's performance. For anyone expecting this film to pay homage to the original and keep it pretty much the same will probably not be happy but if you approach it with an open mind and expect the unexpected I think you will find this an enjoyable experience. Being a fan of Johnny Depp's uniqueness doesn't hurt either.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Reviewing this set feels like a repeat of season one, in that it is another excellent release from HBO.  They really know how to release a quality blu-ray set, from the handsome packaging down to the special features on the discs themselves.  Here's what you get -<br /><br />- All 12 episodes, each with commentary<br />- Special features further exploring the world of Westeros<br />- Digital copies of both the episodes and the special features<br /><br />As usual the episodes look beautiful on blu ray.  The color, depth, texture, and contrast visible in virtually any given scene are downright stunning.  This is the hallmark of HBO blu ray releases, and I'm glad to see that the blu ray transfer for GoT season 2 is as amazing as it was for season 1.  The audio is also top notch whether it's quiet moments being shared or the raucous din of combat.<br /><br />The special features are pretty decent too.  The standout for me is the commentaries.  Each episode gets a commentary track but each track is different.  Some tracks feature writers/showrunners Benioff and Weiss which makes for a very technical, also very interesting, and information heavy commentary.  But then other commentaries feature the actors which are probably my favorite.  For example one commentary features the actors playing the Stark daughters, which is hilarious!  while another features the actors playing the Greyjoy children.  This variation keeps the commentaries from growing stale, is often hilarious, and feels much more intimate - like you're getting to know the people who make the show - than traditional commentaries.  If you're like me you'll find yourself re-watching the episodes then re-watching them again just to hear all of the commentaries.<br /><br />As to the other special features they're also quite nice if you're interested in exploring the rest of Westeros.  If you haven't ready the books, and I can't blame you if you haven't, these are probably going to be incredibly useful.  Locations,characters, families, and histories are provided for different locales throughout Westeros and Essos.  These special features are by no means comprehensive, but they go a long way to helping you understand more about this world, e.g. what is the significance of &#34;The Rains of Castamere&#34; when Bron sings it before the &#34;Battle of Blackwater&#34;, what does that say about the Lannisters?  Tywin?  etc.  Good stuff.<br /><br />Lastly you get some digital copies.  I'm not a fan of digital copies as I'd rather simply not watch something as opposed to watching it on a mobile device, but for those of you who dig them this is a nice bonus.  I am glad that HBO seems to be including these on all of their releases now, and it's nice to have the option of downloading them in HD or SD.  So there's that.<br /><br />In a nutshell the Game of Thrones season 2 blu-rays are the best way to watch and enjoy season 2.  I would recommend this set to anyone.  Period.  Seriously it's great go buy it.
0374275637|5.0|One day, I decided to browse the bookstore (actually it was Barnes and Noble, the only bookstore around here) and saw a thick, white book entitled \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" by Daniel Kahneman and remembered thinking, \\"Wow, that's a big book, I wonder what it's about.\\" So, I purchased it and took it home with me to read. Then, while reading, I kept finding myself in awe of its content and insights.<br /><br />I am well familiar with Gurdjieff's works, especially on the idea of human beings as unconscious machines. When Kahneman describes our mental life with the metaphor of two \\"agents\\" called System 1 (adaptive unconscious/fast thinking) and System 2 (conscious/slow thinking), I am reminded of what Gurdjieff said, \\"the inclination to daydream is due partly to the laziness of the thinking center, that is, its attempts to avoid the efforts connected with work directed towards a definite aim and going in a definite direction...\\" ([[ASIN:4871876306 In Search of the Miraculous: Fragments of an Unknown Teaching]], page 118). The \\"laziness of the thinking center\\" as opined by Gurdjieff is very much a System 1 as described by Kahneman. The dynamics of System 1 and System 2 is pretty well covered by Gurdjieff (from a different perspective, in a roughly divergent context), which had had kept my ardent curiosity throughout the book.<br /><br />I found this book to be very clear and extremely useful. I kept finding myself to be intrigued by the author's flow of how he presented his information and examples to which he is explaining how our thoughts work. I see a lot of myself in the examples being shown where they actually had happened to me in several ways. The concepts of \\"cognitive ease\\" and \\"ego depletion\\" (loss of motivation) are equally interesting.<br /><br />Reading this book as well as other psychology books like [[ASIN:0674013824 Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious]], [[ASIN:0316051888 Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Change]], and [[ASIN:1592407366 You Are Not So Smart]], have helped me to rethink about how mechanical I really am and how correct Gurdjieff was in stating that men are machines. In relation with other books mentioned, Kahneman's book is more recent than Wilson's works and more up to date.<br /><br />Even though it's a very long reading, I assure the reader that it's well worth it.<br /><br />It's highly recommended.ge]], and [[ASIN:1592407366 You Are Not So Smart]], have helped me to rethink about how mechanical I really am and how correct Gurdjieff was in stating that men are machines.

B00065MDRW|5.0|Time: 1969, in the basement listening to KMYR FM Radio in the Denver metro area- listened to \\"In The Court of The Crimson King\\" album in its entirety, broadcast by one of the most avant garde/underground radio stations in the US. It blew me away. I went out and bought it at WAX TRACKS as soon as it hit the album bins. To this day this Album/CD still carries the same magic as it did way back when. Robert Fripp is one the most under appreciated guitarists of the 60's-70's and deserves to be remembered among the likes of Roger Waters and Sid Barret of Pink Floyd in his creative abilities. This Album/CD belongs to a genre not heard much anymore, \\"the concept album\\". This is a true gem of a CD and should one like what they hear, there is more of Fripp's music available through Amazon.

0385474547|5.0|\\"Things Fall Apart\\" is one of those modern classics that I just never got around to reading. I finally read it, and I understand now why I was told repeatedly to do so. The book is written in a manner that is literary, yet also mimics the cadence and style of the oral tradition method of storytelling that would have been native to the Ibo people of Nigeria of whom the novel is about. It takes the reader a while to get use to the Ibo names, terms, and colloquialisms and for that reason a short glossary of Ibo terms is included in the back of the text. It is useful, however you can figure out what most of the Ibo words mean from context.<br />The protagonist of \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is Okonkwo, a dislikable, insecure, mean man. He comes across to the surface reader as the archetypal ignorant male head of the house. That is a lazy read, as Chinua Achebe has written a novel that goes deep below the surface, and although the novel and many of the customs are very dated and specific to the Ibo people of the 1890s, the problems that plague the characters (but not many of the circumstances) are universal and always will be. Don't read this novel with the goal of feeling culturally superior. Read it and accept it on its own terms and you will get so much more out of it.<br />There are many characters in the text, and it is to Mr. Achebe's credit that they all come across as very real, and his ability to give a good characterization in just a few sentences is astounding at times. One of my favorite characters is Uchendu, the uncle of Okonkwo. Although he does not appear until halfway through the novel and does not speak much, when he does speak pay attention. Some of the novel's best moments are his and much of the thematic wisdom of the text comes from his mouth.<br />This novel is a surprisingly quick read, you are sucked in quite seductively and don't realize it until it is too late. I hesitate to say what \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is about, but I will say that I think the novel does deal with a man who is uncomfortable in the time in which he lives. Okonkwo is a man who should have been born 100 year earlier. He is a strong man, in the traditional sense, but weak in the ways that matter. He is a man living down his father (who isn't) and an insecure individual who masks his fears by abuse and anger. The novel's ending is a chilling warning about where that path leads.<br />I regret that I have not read this wonderful novel sooner. Don't make the same mistake!oes deal with a man who is uncomfortable in the time in which he lives. Okonkwo is a man who should have been born 100 year earlier.

B00BESM14U|2.0|The beginning of the film, along with the trailer looked and sounded so promising.  The actors are new, fresh and very cute!Unfortunately, it went downhill from there.  Personally, we do not think that a film based on teen-age homosexuality and child molestation are topics for a PG-13 movie.  The trailer was definitely misleading - we thought we were going to see a light-hearted story about a young man who was shy and how he made new friends.  The movie depressed us.
B0026O475M|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I wanted to watch it with my granddaughter, but did not know where to find it.

I will definitely do this again.
B009KEN87O|5.0|brings back memories. classic space invaders. very easy to play. great time killer. not bad at all for a free game.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Rodriguez, aka Sugarman, made two albums in the early 70s.  They went nowhere... except for South Africa where he became a huge, super-star, without his ever knowing it.  Nothing at all was known about him other than rumors that he committed suicide on stage during a performance.  Two South African fans decided to find out what really happened to him.  Rodriguez emerges as an extraordinary man in a gripping film. Recommend it highly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is so much better than temple run 1 and I definataly recrmend this game if your bored
B003QSMC18|5.0|The beautiful art work and animation reminded me of the older Disney movies like Snow White.  The story and characterization made this a show that would appeal to people of all ages, except young children who might be frightened by some of the &#34;voodoo&#34; sequences.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I finished this book in two days.  I stayed up late reading it even though I had to work the next day so I give it 4 stars.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Def a great game. I had to use the hint button quite a bit. It was fun to play and a good way to pass time.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It's a good three-swap game; the graphics are pretty, but sometimes hard to distinguish between. I like the world/village build.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|the first one was good and the sencond one is better. Cannot wait till i finish it so i can read the thrid
B009KEN87O|5.0|A fun deluxe space invaders style game with a bit of galaga mixed in.  Modern with a retro feel.  Like classic arcade games?  If so then try this.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|My Grandfather had thousands of slides which I inherited when he passed. I am a huge fan of photography and all the gadgets used in printing! I loved this little scanner, it was super easy to use and created a quality image! Having worked in a photo lab in the past I don't mind the fact that it does not scan at an extremely high resolution. Most people don't realize that you only need about a 6 mp image to print a clear 16x20 image, so for printing a 4x6 this is the perfect size! The only thing that you have to be careful of is when you put your film/slide in the device it lightens it which if you aren't careful it will wash out your image, this is very easily solved by being quick with the scan button! I was able to scan over 2,000 slides in about 6 hours once I was used to using it! Overall I am highly recommend this scanner!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|The album seems to have a bit more of a pop sound to it than their prior album &#34;Brothers&#34;, but still definitely a Black Keys production. The songs are catchy and make for great driving music.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm new to Angry Birds - this game is great fun!!!!! No wonder it is so popular - you should download.
B0095G5AFU|3.0|It works fine. I just somehow envisioned something different. I only use it for small remonders. I thought I could replace all my school notebooks
B007712XAU|3.0|the quality of the dvds is not the best.  the pictures are not sharp and crystal clear.  it is ok
B009KEN87O|5.0|There has been a lot of retro games out there, but this is definitely the best. it never stops surprising wave after wave.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|My husband Joe really enjoyed these angry birds.  You have to put the birds in a sling shot and blow up buildings ect.
B000006TZ8|3.0|There are some really good songs on this album, but I don't think this album is one of The Jam's best.  If you are just coming to the Jam, get &#34;Setting Sons&#34; and &#34;Sound Affects&#34; first.  This album and &#34;This is the Modern World&#34; come once you're hooked and have to have everything.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|And Michael Buble changes Christmas forever. It is incredible to mix classic, with soulful and pop. This is a must have for all Christmas collections.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I am finding more and more boring for the most part.  I hung in for the last few chapters because they tend to be the most exciting and answer all the questions.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I love the ability to purchase MP3 versions of the albums or CDs as I don't have the storage for all my music. I am a big promoter of MP3s and Amazon.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Serious yet very funny! Emma Watson does a great job. Good story for teens and twenty-somethings struggling to make friends.<br />Showed what not to do if you want to be alive, but also helps with understanding those 'different' from you. Enjoyed it very much.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I bought this for my niece and nephews and they loved it! I like Legos but obviously this is much more for little kids. I know that they enjoyed taking turns opening the different windows each night and playing with the little legos very much.
1936891026|1.0|I bought the kindle edition almost 3-4 months back and had not read it till today.  All the glowing reviews on this book set the expectations high for this book.<br /><br />I just finished reading this book - started reading at 3:00 PM with a cup of coffee, notebook and a pen to keep making as I read it.  The preface was pathetic, but anyway, I leaped into reading the meat of the book ...<br /><br />The first couple of pages were about resistance, fear ... how it affects our thinking, decisions ...  Yeah - it is sound advice, good advice - but if I am really looking for advice, there are thousands of books, millions of blogs and youtube videos which contain advice and practical steps to implement them.<br /><br />Overall - this is useless book to read - waste of time, money and energy.  Skip this book and move on to better ones ...
B000YDG5W0|5.0|Received these boots last week. They are extremely soft leather and break in right away. Boots run a little bigger than some others. All in all great fit and great, comfortable boot
067144901X|5.0|My ten-month-old son and I had a wonderful time reading this one together! He's at the age where he likes to mimic the sounds he hears. He really enjoyed hearing me make the various animal sounds, and I was delighted when he tried to imitate them.<br /><br />The illustrations are simple, which is perfect; there's just enough on each page to keep him interested without being overwhelmed.<br /><br />This was a great opportunity to be silly with my son, quacking back and forth amid lots of giggles...but it was also a nice way to introduce animals that a kid his age may not have seen yet. (Although he's observed a cat or two, my son has yet to see a horse, sheep, pig, etc.)<br /><br />Lots of fun, and definitely worth owning, because we will be re-reading this one many, many times!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Great movie! Heath and Christian make this movie what it is superb! I would recommend this and the other two movies in the series if you're a batman fan!
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Nobody does what Clutch does quite like Clutch does it.<br /><br />A more straightforward and heavier outing than Beale Street or Strange Cousins, but I am good with that. More along the lines of Blast Tyrant or Robot Hive with a more hard rock feel.<br /><br />Loving Neil's vocals as always, although the title track has just an okay chorus.<br /><br />The Face maybe my favorite track in an album filled with a lot of great stuff. Love Clutch.
B009KEN87O|5.0|great game, I highly recommended. I really enjoyed playing it I think I would have bought it if you wasn't free. He has a lot of detail to the old Atari games. It's a great  pick for the free app of the day.
B007KAJG3K|2.0|I really loved the first Sherlock Holmes film, Starring Robert Downey, Jr.  It was smart, funny, charming, interesting, and didn't really abrogate very many elements of the original novels.  However, the second in the series, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, was devoid of the qualities of the original.  Most of the qualities of the first film were missing.  It was just a noisy, fast, shoot-em-up adventure geared toward adolescent boys.  The actors did a fairly good job with a pretty bad script. I can't recommend this film to anyone.
0670022411|5.0|Reading about witchs, vampires and demons isn't my normal kind of book but I took a chance on this new fiction author. I'm soooo glad I did. It begins a bit slow but it doesn't take long to realize the author is simply setting up the characters for you. Then, it takes off and I couldn't put it down. Thankfully, when the ending came, which I thought was way too soon, I was so glad that the second book in this trilogy was already on the market. I bought it immediately! To me, if a book isn't at least 500 pages, it's a short story and should be in a magazine. It takes real talent to write a book nearly 600 pages long and keep a readers interest. And what I love about this author is that she doesn't get graphic with violence or sex. She's a rare find and I recommend this book to anyone who truly loves holding a book in their hands and reading for hours!
B0000549B0|5.0|I love that I finally have this movie for myself and don't have to wait for some station to air it.<br />There was no damage to the product.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I got this just for multiplayer - which doesn't function.  blech.  survivalcraft is far superior at half the price.  don't waste your time with this!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I read the book and wanted to see the series. They did a great job with following the story as well as casting the actors. I'd recommend this for anyone interested in the war.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a good game for when your bored. I like it. It is very fun. I'm doing this for 3 gems because you need gems for cool stuff for your horse or avatar.
B00013M6NK|2.0|I had to buy one in the camera store before I left for vacation. They weren't even there when I got back. Came 3 days after I got back.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Love this show!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is the worst book I've ever read.  I was tempted several times to stop reading it, but I have a policy of finishing books that I have started.  It is a shame, because the author seems to have a talent for drawing the reader in, but the plot is completely unbelievable and it is impossible to connect with any of the characters because they are so shallow and self-centered.  I cannot believe this book was on the NY Times Best Seller List!  I will definitely be more careful when buying books off of this list in the future.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|We rented the movie and it was currently unavailable the next night even though we had a 48 hour rent on it now it says we have to BUY the movie even though we still had a day of renting left.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|I loved this movie even though it made me cry.  Such a positive look on how people can come together for all reasons.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this series! Keeps you riveted till the end! Book is way better than the movie! Won't be able to t it down
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I found this on the App of the Day, so it was free. I think you'd be pleased with it, though-even at $5. A good match 3 game with the backdrop from the book. If you've never read the book, this should pique your interest to read a classic!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its an amazing app and its kinda like the My Dragon app, fun, amusing, and no glithes.<br />I think its a good way to get a kids atention too.
B009AMALGM|1.0|The latest installment of the Paranormal Activity series falls flat on it's face with very little in scary moments and few questions answered in regards to the events of PA 1 & 2.
B003Y74KAW|4.0|good deal for the price, wish it would fit a little snugger to the iPhone 4, other wise a good deal
B009KEN87O|5.0|I love this game so much! filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler filler
B00AG472DS|5.0|The blu ray directors cut is Awesome! There are 2 commentary tracks one with director david fincher and one with gyllenhal, Downey the writer and crime novelist James Ellroy, who is a riot. There are also features on the actual case and the lead suspect arthur leigh allen, plus your in depth making of featuring how accurate they got the sets and costumes, and the actors real life counter parts. As for the film, it is a Brilliant study in how police non cooperation and dumb luck can make the difference between a killer going free and lives being saved. The cast is to die for(no pun intended) Downey is at his best along with Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as the main detectives. What makes this film so special is that they don't explore or exploit the victims or the murder's they spend all their attention on the case work and how it effects the characters lives. Just great acting , Brilliant directing, and a very intense look at a small dark time in california history. Bravo to all involved!!!!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|This is such a friendly format. In an instant you can catch up on any field you want. And the sky is the limit!<br />I received this from a friend's recommendation and immediately raved to my own pals. Terrific site.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book kept me spellbound. The author is a great wordsmith and has a wonderful sense of humor. I only wish it had not ended!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its awesome I get to live my own life in the game world.<br />Its like living as an adult but I am only an 11year old boy.
0891419063|5.0|Eugene B. Sledge depicts an amazing first hand account of the fighting on Peleliu and Okinawa. Eugene was able to write what the fighting was like in real time events with his memory fresh as he kept a diary in his Bible. The result shows the true horrors of war. This is truly a great book that reflects bravery in the face of uncomprehensible brutality. I would definitely recommend this book...
B00992CF6W|5.0|my parents r so crul they won't let me get it I was betting. for three months and they said I can get it on my birthday but no they can't keep a promise to me .
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Ha sido de gran ayuda para manejar la cámara, los lentes y todos los accesorios en forma segura y cómoda.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|I like WALTER. Same actor in Lord of the Rings as steward of Gondor. Subject is more science and speculations of reality. I like all the characters. Olivia starts out a little weak but has earned her place in the center of the tale/s.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved every moment of the book. Filled with mystery, romance, fantasy, and suspense; \\"The Night Circus\\" has something every reader will enjoy.
B009KEN87O|5.0|! Yes, yes,  yes,  yes, I like it, I like it, I like it! I like it... I dont want to know your name... I just want --ng --ng ba--...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love it so much in all the ways possible it has so much detail and I love that stuff
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I read the book and I've watched this movie several times.  I enjoy it more each time I view it!
B000M5AJQS|1.0|Possibly I bought the only version of this movie that wasn't edited.  If so, then it's also possible that it may be worth more than the $7.99 I paid for it at Costco.  But not much more in my opinion.  I don't know when I got off the movie appreciation bus, but after viewing this flick, I see now why I prefer production prior to the new millennium. After all, aren't movies supposed to entertain, educate, enthrall, or enlighten us about our fellow man?  This film did none of the above.  It is no wonder that this film received high acclaim by absolutely no one in the biz with the exception of Martin Scorsesephiles.  And I'm almost glad that the editing seemed to have been done by a food processor because if I could have followed the plot I'm sure I would have been even more revolted, (if that's possible!).  If anyone out there thinks they would like this waste of Hollywood talent, please feel free to email me and I'll send you my copy.  It is not even worth donating to the SPCA charity thrift shop.<br />rml on Kauai
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I 've loved the books as a child. Now I can see who belongs to all those names finally.  Very good movie!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was drawn to write a review, when I usually don't, to protect other avid readers like myself. To me, this is the worst kind of book. It starts off amazing. Characters are interesting, you're drawn in, and dying to know what comes next. Then you get to part 2, and it takes a drastic twist in another direction. You're not enjoying it as much as part 1, but you're still curious what's going to happen as characters start to make illogical decisions and you find you're not quite relating to them as much as you were before. Then you get to part 3 - it becomes utterly ridiculous, and actually infuriating. The behaviors are ridiculous and actually made me angry. I won't ruin the story line for anyone, but the ending is ludicrous and a huge disappointment after such a fantastic beginning. There are wonderful books out there, and despite getting off to a great start, this just isn't one of them.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|the game is great, but it is super unresponsive... and laggy. Coin collecting is difficult because of the lag. Even if the internet connection is great, it takes forever to catch up. I do not recommend this game for the kindle fire, at least not until it is running correctly, maybe with an update or three...
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I watched this movie with my husband one night when the kids were out.  We really enjoyed it.  There was significant crude humor that may offend those of us without an iron comedy stomach.  If you can stand some anatomy and sex jokes, you'll find this entertaining.
1434102750|5.0|An outstanding book, which capsulizes a technique for creative thinking. It has been immensely helpful to me in creative writing, advertising, real estate and business ventures.<br /><br />Young was a famous ad man, and in retirement an outstanding mail order entrepreneur (as \\"Webb Young, Indian Trader\\"), but his simple step-by-step technique is valuable no matter what the reader's field of endeavor.
034580404X|5.0|Need a bit of spark? Need some ideas? Just need to imagine or think about. This is the book. And a love story to boot.
B00005RDRO|5.0|The DVD doesn't come with extras, but Niel Simon's hilarious writing is enough. An all star cast features Alec Guinness, Truman Capote, David Niven, Peter Falk, Peter Sellers, and James Coburn. The humor ranges from amusing puns to sizzling satire of some of mystery fiction's most famous sleuths.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Nice story - good prevails.  wanted a &#34;non-cartoon&#34; movie with a good message for my grandkids.  They love watching it
B000JMKNV0|4.0|Great plot with very surprising finsh. Bok really makes you think about illnesses of the mind. Would recommend to others.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|my grandkids asked me to download this fun - mindless game.  they both really enjoy it.  I have tried it, and try as I may, I cannot match their score
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the series but the ending seemed a bit simple<br />I would recommend this series to everyone, great for parents to read to Kids 11 to 16
0385751532|5.0|Required for my daughter's junior high English class but a better deal than I could get at other bookstores in my area.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Loved it until I saved and excited, came back to resume the same puzzle and all my progress was gone. I had to start over. This happened twice. Very frustrating because this app has great potential.
B003MC5N28|3.0|Not a feel good book if you are mislead by the name. An English requirement for one of my children and it was torture getting her to read it.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game has a lot of activities to keep you entertained. You can build up an army as well as a town. If you prefer to spend more time battling enemies to achieve level advancements you can or you can concentrate on completing challenges to advance. Overall the game is well rounded and very entertaining. The only downside of the game is the inability to earn diamonds which are required to complete challenges and to unlock some upgrades. Diamonds are purchasable but then purchasing diamonds can get expensive.
B001DSNFZA|2.0|I love this album and was very excited when I saw it was available, as the reissue is currently discontinued and only used albums are typically for sale. But, who would ever want to get rid of this album? It's that good.<br /><br />The batch goHastings has must be quality-rejects or something, as the record I received was new and sealed, never used or opened. However, there were visible, yet minor scratch marks all over the record. Again, the record still looked new, like the scratches had come from the manufacturing, not from previous use. Anyways, I tried it to see if it would still play. No dice. Skipped many times through each song.  Basically unplayable.<br /><br />I have contacted goHastings about my item. I will post an update when I have one.
0316227706|5.0|Love this book, amazing pictures!! So creative and revealing of the dogs personalities. A great gift for a dog lover.
0738212415|5.0|&#34;Item as described, received in good order and promptly.&#34; DONT KNOW WHY THE REVIEW NEEDS TO BE SO LONG ITEM WAS WHAT WAS WANTED.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks, predictable,  but entertaining to read.  Not too deep or mysterious.  I like more mystery, but the children added much to the story
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have been a reader of Riordan's books for a pretty long time now, and I have to say, this book ranks among his best(although not the best).I like the idea of Roman and Greek culture coming together, and at the same time clashing. Here's to the Heroes of Olympus.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Ever since I got the game I love it. It's so fun and kinda funny when you attack the humans. It's not even extremely gory if you think it is but you can make it more bloody if you like. Love the game. I play it all the time. Even my 5 &amp; 2 year old cousins want to keep playing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this app. It tastes like apples. That makes no sense! I play it all the time!!! I want them to make temple run 3!!! I am so loving this game!!! Do u think they should make temple run 3?

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a special Bible and evertone who uses it will benefit from all it has to offer. The best book for all to read daily.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never cried reading during a book, but this, simply beautiful. I was very skeptical about the book because John green is a man but he did a flawless job.
B009KEN87O|5.0|It's very easy to get used to the controls and really fun to play.  It's one of the most fun games I've played on my phone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|No review is necessary.  If you love Downton then you know how wonderful this series is.  I was amazed to find this dvd set in my mailbox on the day it was released.  I had preordered it and it arrived on opening day.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Thanks CMO.  1 of the disks in the Downton Abby set was defective and when I notified CMO they immediately replaced the defective disk and sent it 1st cls mail.  Very satisfied.
