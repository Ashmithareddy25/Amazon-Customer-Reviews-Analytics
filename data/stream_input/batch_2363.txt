B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|There has never been a series quite like this.  Absurd, understated humor,  thoughtful, topical, 1 2 3 4 5 6.  (8-)
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Nothing said about how the body was dumped at sea, but then the Seals, were not part of that episode.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My only objection to this is that I am tempted to spend far too much time with it !!  In the time that I have been involved with it I have gleaned some of the best recipes ever, and also many, many ideas for use with young children, which is my profession.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Movie was really slow and if it hadn't been for Tommy Lee Jones it would have been totally boring.  I can't believe Lincoln was such a boring man.
B004G6009K|4.0|Fun to watch for children. We thought the 3D version could have been better. Great movie in 2D. Not worth the extra $ for 3D.
B004UPANGM|5.0|Bruce's comedic acting is what makes this movie, if it had a more serious actor playing the part it would just not be anywhere as good.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Great humor for all ages. Good clean fun. We have watched this movie over 20 times in the last weeks and still find it the best.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I really loved the whole story line, yes I know some of it is impossible, (we will just assume the whole earth invaded thing is possible) a couple of folks cannot operate a battleship, but it is a movie not a documentary or recount of a true story.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|I got this as the FAOTD a few weeks ago. Coincidentally, I also got Call Of Atlantis a while back as the FAOTD. Here are my thoughts on 80 Days:<br /><br />1) It is basically the exact same game as Atlantis, only the puzzles are laid out differently. Still, though, all of the exact same puzzle strategies are in both games. Why bother creating this if you knew it was sentially identical to another game you had already put out?<br /><br />2) Puzzles are incredibly frustrating. These aren't the kind of obstacles you can outwit with planning or skill. No, the solutions to these puzzles usually rely on luck that the correct piece will drop and will still be on the field when you finally work down to where you need it. Just be careful not to pay attention to the move hint. If you have the option of moving a game goal piece back into lock-up, it will almost always suggest that move which will screw you right over.<br /><br />3) This is a &quot;PREMIUM&quot; paid app. The person who has spent money on it should NOT be forced to click through a screen full of advertising for your other games, and then assaulted by more such advertising in the main menu.<br /><br />If you have any other match 3 game already installed on your device--particularly any match 3 game from Playrix--you don't need this one. Move on.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is an outstanding read. Constant surprises. Detailed science. Comprehensible. Humorous. Exciting. And in Kindle Reader an excellent value. I hope to see more science fiction from Mr. Weir.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My son's dog ate the cord for my Kindle. I knew the best place to get a replacement was Amazon to be sure to get one that truly worked. I love Amazon.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great little game and time passer. The only reason I give it 4 stars is b/c there is always room for improvement.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I was very happy with this app and found it very easy to use. The information was right there, complete,  in color and loaded quickly. Now it's gray and blah and not inviting at all. Since radar is usually in color and the app isn't, I'm not even bothering with that. I'm getting rid of this app
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Better than I thought it was going to be.<br /><br />A few people that I work with really enjoyed it and had been talking about it.  I finally decided to read it so we all could talk about it.  I had a hard time putting it down.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|ABOUT ME AS A FAN:  I turned 15 the month TOS began in 1966.  During its first season, it ran on Thursday nights against two of my mother's favorite shows, Bewitched and That Girl on ABC.  Being a one-television family, my mom always won control of the TV.  TOS moved to Friday nights for seasons two and three.  Since by then I had turned 16 and gotten my driver's license, I was rarely home on Friday nights, and if I was for some reason, I would watch something else.<br /><br />So, for various reasons, I didn't see TOS during its original run.  However, in 1972, after I got out of the Army ('69-'71), I began watching TOS in syndication and became a fan of the show.  Through the years, I considered purchasing the series, first on VHS and later on DVD, but didn't do it.  I could not see paying the price asked for the series when I had seen all the episodes over the years.  But, when I saw TOS (remastered) in syndication on TV in 2006, I decided I would eventually get TOS on DVD.  Up until recently, I thought the remastered series was too pricey.  I thought I might get it when it got down under a hundred dollars from AMAZON LLC.  Well, about a week ago I received it from AMAZON LLC for $98.06.<br /><br />MY EQUIPMENT:  I am playing the DVDs on a Sony Upscaling DVD Player I purchased back in 2010 connected to my 2½ year old 32\\" Samsung HD TV in my home office.  I usually sit between 5 and 6 feet away from the screen.<br /><br />THE DVD SET:  The packaging is not very good as others have noted, so I won't bother with that aspect of the set.  All the DVDs \\"look like\\" double-sided discs, but as I understand it, that's because season one discs are double-sided (HDTV/STDTV) and the manufacturer wanted all the discs to look alike even though seasons two and three discs are single-sided.  I have randomly loaded and played 4 or 5 discs from season one and 2 discs each from seasons two and three.  All those that I tried loaded and played fine.  They all play with the little white ring with black lettering facing up.<br /><br />The image quality if outstanding and I like the CGI stuff, especially those scenes with the starship orbiting around the beautiful planets.<br /><br />I have only two complaints.  Number one, during the beginning of each episode of season one, when Kirk gives his \\"Space: The Final Frontier.\\" intro, the music (which I like) is nice and loud but Kirk sounds like he's deep inside a cave with his hand over his mouth.  The intro in seasons two and three seem fine.  Number two, and there is simply NO EXCUSE for this, no English subtitles.  Fortunately, the characters' voices are pretty clear.  For those who are a little hard of hearing like me (I have ringing 24/7), you might consider wireless headphones.  They've helped me . . . a lot!  I don't use mine all the time, but for those shows where the music and/or sound effects tend to drown out dialogue, they're GREAT.<br /><br />So, I got the original 79 episodes plus the two versions of The Cage, a total of 80 shows, from a very reliable seller with an excellent return policy for $98.06 or a little less than $1.23 per show, not counting all the extras.  Come on now. THAT is a fantastic deal.
B008D30K7E|4.0|An imaginative and delightful book.  There's almost a smugness about the primary character's laissez faire attitude, but it tuns out to be lovability.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|I remember watching this when it first came out.  My boyfriend's daughter started watching this and wasn't able to finish so I bought the DVD for her to watch.  We watched it together.  She is 14 and really liked it.  Watching it agin, still makes you think of how cruel we can be to others, what it's like not being understood, what we do effects others and the things we go through growing up.  As I was watching it again, I thought it is a good movie to watch with teenagers (boys and/or girls) and have that opening for disussing life in general and that no matter what we are going through we don't know what others are going through and life might be tougher for them.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Always entertained by the twists and turns of N Sparks books. I trust the characters and even feel bad for the villain sometimes.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Due the marketing posters I originally chose to avoid this show. On a bored Saturday I watched the pilot online.  After that I was hooked.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|A book I didn't want to put down.<br />Was quite an eye opener to all that truly went on during the war.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|So...season two is not as good as season one....who cares.  It's better than Snooki and Jwwowww or whatever the deuce people are watching.  The books were amazing...however then lack one major thing in comparision to the series:<br /><br />THEY DO NOT FIT IN MY BLU-RAY PLAYER OR WORK IN SURROUND SOUND OR DISPLAY ON MY TELE.<br /><br />So thats like 9 things actually if you count each speaker of my 7.1 system that fails to play any sounds whatsoever out of my books.<br /><br />Anyway, this combo rocked, beat the local distributor of such materials by almost $20 on release day!  Awesome AmaZon!  You rocks.  Love these combo packs.<br /><br />Really though, I only wanted the blu-ray, the other randoms bits and bobs that come with this will be used to keep me warm once winter actually gets here.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|My husband and I were looking for a new show to watch and started this one to try it out. Now we're hooked!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was an incredible book! Tragic but it captured the imagination, I highly recomend this book to anyone and everyone looking for something a little different.
B004QBWU02|5.0|This DVD was great. This is the kind of movie we watch over and over, and It had really interesting facts about the movie too.
B009NNG202|1.0|A very twisted little film, of which the greatest surprise was finding Dustin Hoffman playing a part, with a starring actor that the only thing he does, besides bored us to no end, is to use his above sense of smell, like a creature from another world, later to become a murderer. Fantastic, bizarre, extremely slow paced, this film makes you wonder about those power brokers that decide to fund ventures such as this one. In his constant search for the ultimate scent, I suppose, he walks around France never looking very clean. This one suck Big Lemons. 1 Star.
B00C0QOZP8|4.0|While it isn't nearly as good as House of Gold & Bones Part 1, it still holds up as a pretty good album, worth looking into.
0307987698|5.0|Typical kids book. No all I hear is &#34;more, elmo. More, Grover&#34; over and over until I read it again.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|This was a good movie with some strong performances.  It, however, disappointed because it was not like the book at all. Not that the story it told was not worthwhile. But, there was so much more of the political intrigue of the time that it did not touch.
0740797719|5.0|This is an excellent resource for any painter no matter the level of expertise!It should be a staple in every artist's library.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 7 yr old describes it as subway temple run.  It is fun and addictive.  We all love this app
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|This show is an emotional roller coaster, sometimes you will love the leading characters, sometimes you will hate them.  And always you will feel that if you or a loved one were a victim of a crime, you would without a doubt want these guys in your corner.  This show is full of surprises and interesting characters, and they seem to change a little as the seasons go forward.  Great show but not for the squeamish or the political left.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|We love this!  It is a really fun game.  Very addictive.  I love trying new trick combos to earn an extra speed boost.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Connelly continues to keep you attention in a great series of mysteries,always a pleasure to read one and harder to put it down...
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|Not sure if it is a user error or an app error.  I tried downloading to my kindle and to my computer.  I got nothing.  Oh well.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Lots of action.  Characters are well defined.  I loved all three in the trilogy.  Larsson really kicked his skills into high gear with this third novel.
1451613512|5.0|When are they going to release the Showtime series on DVD? Add this book alongside William Blums, Howard Zinns, Noam Chompskys and many others.A real page turner -incredible. What is so wrong with just telling the truth about history??
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The characters are well defined and the story line draws one into each episode. It's enjoyable and relaxing viewing. A nice change from news that is not news.
0062014536|1.0|I don't like how the book just ended abruptly. With no closure, nothing. It seems like there should be another book. If there isn't I will be disappointed in the whole series. Everything that happened in the books lead up to this? If this is the last book I will be disappointed. The ending gave no closure to anything that happened. The end of this book just ruined the whole series for me. Worst book she's written. I'd rather just forget book 2 & 3. Especially 3!!!
B0029O0BLS|3.0|There's a lot about Sphere that I really like, but I can understand why a lot of people don't like it - it definitely has some flaws, like weird plotting and pace, and a terrible ending.<br /><br />As for this Bluray, it's great. Good special features including commentary and some making-of material that, while it is press kit stuff, was still fun.<br /><br />If you like this movie, the Bluray is a safe bet.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I was looking for a different cube game similiar to this one but couldn't find it. This one is ok.
B000B8L6LI|5.0|my father is visually impaired and this is great for him because he can not see the angle he is sharpening.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|when you get an app, whether it is free or not, you expect quality.  this app was very well thought out and I highly recommend it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun game with unobtrusive ads. Playing style is easy to master, reminiscent of the Bejeweled series of games. A great game for any age. :D
B007Q35PLI|5.0|A wonderful movie about a remarkable woman who revolutionized humane treatment of food animals, and opened the world of autism to those on the outside looking in.
B0035JLVWY|5.0|like Gere a lot - he was very good in role<br />ending was very surprising<br />good twist - did not anticipate the ending
B004DMIIOG|5.0|Summer Wars is perhaps one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. If you are an anime fan do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
B000JCQCW4|3.0|Did not like Bursen role<br />not a very good story line<br />a bit boring to say the least!<br />other roles so-so
B00BHMETKC|1.0|this movie should never had won an academy award ahead of steven's Lincoln or any other for that matter.<br />same old stale ben. without some of the great supporting cast, it shouldn't even been produced. but how do you see Lincoln and the other great film's and say with any brain, that this one was the best!!!!!<br />ben afleck cannot act just like his wife cannot act. plastic faces and stone personalities. look at how he looked when receiving the awards, blank, he hasn ['t changed that expressions in any movie.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|! Easy to learn and constantly changing. I also like the fact that there are tournaments and other people you know are playing the same game.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|not the greatest animation film I have seen, but for kids it passes. rather boring and predictable.<br />I would recommend this one for 1.20.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|So I got the c.d.! It wasn't in a cd case, but instead comes with the pieces to put into a case. It's extremely cool putting it together! I wish that I could do this with all discs that I buy!<br />Other than that, this amazing c.d. came in great condition and even earlier than expected! Thanks guys! This is awesome!
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|movie was no brainer, literally! ethan hawke played in better movies. the ending was even worst. not recommended for people who like scarry movies.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|it is awesome movie and i really enjoy it and i am the terminator fans and i can not to see the termionator 5.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game always looking for updates can't wait for villagers and I can't wait until you add saddles and boats
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|hi i am the terminator fans  and i really enjoy this film and can not wait to see the terminator 5.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Interesting... too short not sure there is proof of anything in the book.  The worst part is he claimed he asked God about dark matter and dark energy and he can't remember what he was told.  Ugh
B0013ND36G|5.0|It is awesome movie so far and i am the terminator fans and i can not wait to see terminator 5.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Excellent film. Look forward to later installments, and seeing Smaug's full form, as well as the battle that is to come. Watching Gollum think during the riddles ... funny. I was watching the hd bluray (haven't watched the 3d version yet) with a friend whose name is Thor (yes, that is his real given name). When the king of Erebor's name was first spoken, we looked at each other then back to the TV. The look on his face was priceless. The king of Erebor's name is Thror.  Watched the film 3 times since it arrived.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The story kept me on edge. Although I got sick of the on again/off again, there were several times where  the story could have taken any number of paths and because of that it was hard to put it down.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I hadn't been a watcher of The Good Wife on network television, it was recommend by a friend. Once I saw the first episode I was hooked. I watched all of season one in one sitting, finally forcing myself to bed at 4:15 AM.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Love the look of it on my Kindle.  It works as an alarm clock, too.  I like the extra icons for weather, etc.  The only suggestion I have is to make it more Fun, when it is not active and just sitting on my kindle turntable, can it still show the current time?  It just shows the 08:05 AM.  I guess that would mean your would have to make it 'always active' or something like that.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Great Movie !!! Very funny, yet touching at the same time.  It's based on a true story.  This goes on my one of my all time favorite movies.
B002722R64|4.0|I originally saw Goldeneye in Hong Kong over a 1995 Christmas vacation for $55 Hong Kong dollars.  I remember walking out of the theater thinking it was a great movie.  Almost 20 years later it rates as worth watching.  The one liners are a bit cheesier, the action a touch slower but 2nd level computer programmer Izabella Scorupco is still a beautiful Bond girl.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MUSICAL WHICH HAS SUCH PASSION, FUN,<br />AND NAUGHTY MOMENTS IN THIS CLASSIC FILM THAT MUST BE SEEN BY ALL<br />GENERATIONS.
1412960991|5.0|This book arrived pretty fast and in very good conditions!  I'm glad with the purchase I made! I recommend this site 100%.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I would recommend this movie, very different from what I thought it would be, was very happy that I bought it
B005PK57NU|5.0|This has to be one of the best if not the best written series we have ever watched.  I am so glad amazon prime can watch for free.Have been DVR'ing season 4 and can not wait to start watch it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is like the sky is the limit. You can build a mansion or a town. I love this app and me and my friends play it all day long and from that we built a castle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game evr for any age my dad plays it and he loves  it just as much as me ..... btw everyone needs this game!!!!!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|As a trained scientist, this amazing show drew my attention right from the get go! Yes, there are crazy, abstract, &#34;fringe&#34; ideas, but that's part of the fun. There is a fairly decent science base behind most of the topics, with classic Sci-Fi twists to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Though the show starts out slowly through the first few episodes, it really picks up midway through season one. The interactions between the characters, watching their characters grow, learning more about their various backstories, all kept me coming back for more. Knowing how the show's creators historically work on story and character development in their previous collaborations, gave me hope this would follow suit. And it did at that!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This was a fun book. Typical Sophie Kinsella character. Very lighthearted. Definitely worth the purchase if you like her other books.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was ridiculous..How could any woman let a man dominate her. Only read alf of it<br />wasnt worth my time..
B008JFUO36|4.0|In the year 2077 Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are a working couple who live in a tower on the planet earth. We are given the background: Aliens called Scavengers or \\"Scavs\\" destroyed the moon. The earth went into turmoil. We managed to defeat them through the use of nuclear weapons. With our planet uninhabitable, our people went to live on Titan. An orbiting triangle space station gives orders to Jack whose mission is to maintain an army of drones used to hunt the remnants of the scavengers.<br /><br />Jack's memory was erased in case aliens capture him. He has dreams of a woman (Olga Kurylenko)in NYC from a time long before the invasion. About the time Morgan Freeman shows up, things tie together, we get the twist, and the film takes off in a different direction.<br /><br />The characters in the film are dry. The dialouge was boring. The action moved slow with the film definitely being too long. I enjoyed the one early scene where Cruise attempts a \\"Mission Impossible\\" type of escape, one that fails. The cinematography was great with a decent story line. If you love science fiction and are tired of those SyFy films, this is a welcomed change with neat killer drones and landscapes.<br /><br />I am sure Cruise didn't have to beat himself up too much to accept the role of Luke Skywalker, Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith, Independence), and Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis, Armageddon) all wrapped into one as he saves the world from alien invaders. This film is an obvious Scientology film just like \\"Battlefield Earth\\". Tom Cruise believes, according to \\"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief\\" that he will actually save the planet from alien invaders. Gotta love it.<br /><br />Parental Guide: One f-bombs (1 SOB) no sex, no real nudity. Brief sensuality. Brief Riseborough buttocks (?).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book if you're into reading books that are really great to read and such, but only if you like books and all.
B009H442DG|1.0|When I first heard of this release i figured it would most likely be fairly decent. But after listening to the entire collection my reaction is it's a very poor collection. Yes, it is produced just fine. But with Olivia newton-John and John Travolta involved there will be more than enough money to put together a decent production. Where the problem is the vocal performances by Olivia and John are less than inspiring. Their vocals are short on energy and soul (although Olivia does manage to give us some decent performances it's still not to notch). The song selections themselves are nice but nothing real special. The collection overall is very much formula, what I call paint by numbers. If you really want some great Christmas music I suggest purchasing Carpenters \\"Christmas Portrait\\", now that an outstanding album.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Fun playing with fish and gems love good good good fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun function
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the story line, and I hope something like that never happens in real life. But I love all of the players that play in the serials to...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best caculator app ever. Very simple and easy and is perfect since the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD don't come with a built in caculator app.
B008EKMB82|4.0|But hard reading nonetheless.  Don't misunderstand, I couldn't put it down - but it was not a light book. And as the mother of a Marine combat pilot (and a military veteren myself) I take issue with the idea that many - if any - of our service men and women look upon dropping bombs as just a video game. The attitude of the Japanese military establishment during WWII as the author presents it is not at all reflective of the attitude of the American military, either today or then. The attitude the fictional author's husband is sadly narrow and implies a hypocritical degree of hatred of a group of people he clearly know little about.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|If you have not seen this you have really missed out on some of the most stunning visuals ever captured digitally. An incredible journey to places seldom seen and heard.
0425263908|5.0|it's great......I couldn't put the book down....it keeps you on your seat wondering what's going to happen next..you just don't want the story to never end..the writer done a great job with writing these books
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Every song on this album is excellent, and the quality of the CD and DVD are well worth the price of admission!
B00C1S945G|4.0|Nice to see some (now classic, after 25 years) Star Trek: The Next Generation in HD. The images are more crisp, but the episodes are just as good as they always were. It's great to be able to stream Star Trek episodes for free with my Amazon Prime account - saves money and space on my DVD/Blu-Ray shelf!
0316228532|4.0|I truly enjoyed and admired this book.  I needed to say that first, because it's hard to write a positive review about a novel where characters are so flawed and difficult, especially when there's nothing flashy about their story.  I understand that when the stakes seem so low (a small town council seat) people compare them to the Good and Evil stakes of the Harry Potter books and find them wanting, but as happens in dismissive reviews of many of women writers who attempt this kind of novel, that seems like such stereotypical and lazy criticism.  How people live their daily lives is where it all starts.  How people express their compassion (or not) through local politics, through family politics, through personal whims and desires -- that's the basis for where we end up as a society.  The society Rowling presents is indeed petty and unforgiving (and at many instances unforgivable) yet why is showing it on a more personal level not praiseworthy?  Rowling takes on big topics -- various kinds of familial abuse, drug addiction, bullying -- from an everyday perspective, describing even the most unlikeable characters with both charity and open eyes.  She's especially good (no surprise) at getting into the minds of her teenage subjects, and unlike the mostly black-and-white characters of the Harry Potter books, these are kids I recognize, with complex motivations.  The crimes are (mostly) small-time and the acts of heroism are baby steps, but what can I say? it all rang true for me.  Unless you need magic or spies or armies to make a novel resonate for you, check it out.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series so far. Being a huge Doctor Who fan this is right up my alley. I don't understand why the fourth season is not free through my Amazon Prime account... I already pay for the service and I believe I should be able to watch this and not have to pay per episode for the final installment.
B001QJUX24|4.0|I enjoyed this one and find it to be a classic Wayne and Ford film. ... Great Monument Valley scenery too!
B003EY7IUY|3.0|I felt that this book was good but not as good as all the others. It had a great ending but the whole first half of this book was kinda boring and full of fillers.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show's twists and turns made my husband and I &#34;Homeland Addicts&#34; . .. we finished season 1 in 4 days!  We'd watch one episode and then have to watch the next!  We were quite tired all week because we just couldn't drag ourselves away from Homeland and into bed.  Can't wait to watch Season 2.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|The perspective on each song contained in this collection is enhanced by the context of the collection presented here.  Magnificent music and poetry!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is simply the best - great characters, script, setting and costumes!  I feel like I stand up straighter and speak more clearly after each episode.
B005HSL626|3.0|I downloaded this for my four year old grandson.  He likes it but he doesn't really get the goal.  I played it once and thought it was just okay.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Fantastic .....and as always, Helen Miren is fabulous! Great cast, and a fun look at a landmark film and filmmaker.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I understand why some people don't like the 50 shades books. The writing is not the best and Christian is straight out of every woman's dream a billionaire, pilot, speaks fluent French, the hottest man on earth and all at the age of 26. I get it! But if you can look beyond that a little its truly about a great love story. It's about a man who has had a messed up life and how he comes from nothing to have everything except for true love. It's about a man who would do anything and everything for his friends and family but nothing for himself because he doesn't feel he is worth it, he's not worth loving. It's much more than just a book full of \\"porn\\". Christian's sex life is in many ways the evolution of how he views himself. First by being Mrs. Robinson's sub (not feeling worthy of life the feeling of being broken) then to being the Dom (taking control of life not being told what to do, putting the feelings of being broken away and not allowing them to resurface) and finally experiencing real love making (working through problems, realizing I'm worth loving and that I can love and to not be a victim of my past) These books show that true love is something that you have to fight for and that its worth fighting for. Every relationship has its ups and downs and yes maybe this series dramatizes the \\"normal couples\\" issues but it also shows that just because someone is perfect on paper it doesn't mean they are perfect in the real world. For the love that Christian and Ana have I would fight for and would only hope that some day I have the chance to fight for it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love the Good Wife due to the characters in this series.  Each one is well developed and makes each episode fun to watch.  I would not be able to name a favorite character because I have many.  I love watching the lawyers because they can not wear their hearts on the sleeves and are so good at avoiding expressions which is the opposite of my personality so I'm trying to learn from them.  Each episode is interesting and well written; has sense of humor at times .  I wish season 4 was marked for prime member and free (big smile).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I understand why some people don't like the 50 shades books. The writing is not the best and Christian is straight out of every woman's dream a billionaire, pilot, speaks fluent French, the hottest man on earth and all at the age of 26. I get it! But if you can look beyond that a little its truly about a great love story. It's about a man who has had a messed up life and how he comes from nothing to have everything except for true love. It's about a man who would do anything and everything for his friends and family but nothing for himself because he doesn't feel he is worth it, he's not worth loving. It's much more than just a book full of \\"porn\\". Christian's sex life is in many ways the evolution of how he views himself.

B002RI9BI0|5.0|What a fantastic trilogy this was.  Unlike many trilogies all three books for different and unpredictable.  The characters intricately developed and different across all 3 books.  Excellent and highly recommended.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and the accompanying movie.  Sorry it was so short-lived.  An interesting collection of characters and fairly well acted.  Good storylines.  It was like watching a western in spaceships.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is epic I own all of the ds versions of the game like scriribblenauts and super scribble nauts. They are both very very fun and this game added levels from the original game and the second game I think they have done a very good job on the game. By the way people who's game won't download is probably because they might not have enough to download the file.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This was a beautiful rendition of Jane Austen's &#34;Emma&#34;.  I loved how the characters developed and the acting was superb.  The costumes and settings were beautiful too.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The presidential casting may have been improved...for the sake of the movie as opposed to simply choosing from the well known wardrobe in the obvious casting closet.<br />The subject matter deserved a more realistic portrayal of troupes, most particularly the rendition delivered by our preaching black soldiers as the stage opens, the two lovely unruffled healthy, nay, dapper gentlemen that could see into the future of the blacks emancipation.  Such arrogance only suits those who know the endgame will be a coup.<br />The blacks endured too many indignities for this portayal to ring of truth.<br />no, could have be better, but I am an American, so 4 stars, for the old stars and stripes.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Up to his usual high standard. Very well written, gripping and hard to put down. And very pertinent to these times.<br />I highly recommend it to any serious reader.
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|...more like Contemporary / Easy Listening.  Remember when Bon Jovi was full of balls to the wall Rock 'N' Roll energy?  Where did it go???  I understand they're older and...\\"more mature\\"...but rock is rock.  If you are no longer playing rock, then change the genre to Contemporary.  Still a fan of their older music, and listen to it regularly, but just can't connect with the direction they've been going.  Don't get me wrong...I respect these guys for who they are and what they do, but it's just not rock.
B0063GORYU|4.0|My daughter has played this for years, so thought I'd give it a try.  It's totally different from regular solitaire.  I'm still learning it, seems the object is to complete with the least amount of moves.  It will take some adjustment if you are a regular solitaire fan, like me, but it's worth a shot for something different.

B0012GTZFC|5.0|Model to understand why (most) people just live by head and not by heart. Very good piece of research to help understand and actively lead groups. Provides in-depth understanding of our human psychology and how to interpret language in a different way. Is congruent with understanding provided by eg. Richard Barrett (New Leadership Paradigm) and own research on how we balance between growth- and reflexthinking. Really helpful with great examples.

B009AMANH4|3.0|I found the movie long and drawn out and left me wanting more and not in a good way. I think they left out a lot of opportunities to make it better. Little more war action would have been better though I get this was not a war movie. I also am a history buff and know who is who in history so I think they could have done a better job for the average viewer of who is who etc. Many people I know who saw this were confused.<br /><br />The bonus features on blu ray are pretty lame and there was no option to interact with the movie such as on some dics where you can press an info button and learn a character etc. Detail was good and colors were accurate etc.<br /><br />They could have made more of an impact with the ending at his death such as showing Linoln in the theatre, hear the gun shot etc. I guess they went for the subtle angle but found it weak. They could also have shown Grant and Lee briefly at the table signing the surrender papers (a big part of history) but again they went with the subtle approach and found it weak.<br /><br />Too much silly dialogue at times and while an ok movie, it could have been better. Spielburg did not hit a home run with this one.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Bought for my son to replace a scratched copy. We got this copy for a great price. Love getting a bargain.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was such a gift to me. I too used to be &#34;dying to be me&#34; but I can now say I am &#34;living to be me.&#34; The messages of society and culture tell most of us we need to seek outside ourselves to discover who we are. Nothing can be further from the truth. As Anita so poignantly describes, who we all are is expansive, light-filled and harmonious creative energy. As we are able to connect into this powerful creative force and express it through the desires of our hearts we actualize the potential instilled in us by our Creator. As we each embrace our true self and live in alignment that that force we will create a very different way to live and love than is currently true for most of us. This beautiful book describes this transition from externally motivated to internally motivated in simple and clear language. Anita's dramatic &#34;death&#34; and subsequent new life can allow each of us to remember who we are and why we are here. Give yourself the gift of reading this book!

1604680547|5.0|I had been searching for just the right motif for a quilt project and could not find anything I liked. I found 501 Quilting Motifs and figured there had to be something in it that would work for my project. I received it very quickly and was not disappointed. It had the exact pattern that I had decided to draw freehand and try to use. Now I can just make a copy of the motif and start  marking! There are a variety of motifs. There are also examples of how to use the motif or parts of the motif in various size blocks or borders. I would recommend this book to both novice and experienced quilters. Novices will get the ideas they need and experienced quilters will get new ideas and inspiration. I am glad I bought this book and look forward to using it. It may be the only book of quilting motifs that I will ever need!

B001DM1VXE|2.0|I liked &#34;half&#34; this movie, and that is the part about how everything in the universe can be translated into math which could revolve around this magic 216 number or &#34;Pi&#34;.<br /><br />The problem with this movie was the constant mental illness delusions, and the random plot twists. I didn't really understand where the movie was going for a while. It was sort of like Donnie Darko where you are confused half the time, and then at the end you are supposed to understand, but in this movie nothing is understood at all. The ending did not make any sense to me besides &#34;don't waste your time with math?&#34; was that the moral of the movie? Enjoy life? Eh, sort of a waste of time, but I have time to waste. :)
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This movie had some funny moments but very few of them. The entire movie seemed like a painful watch for a chuckle here and there. The only thing this movie did for me was make me think the characters were terrible people; also being 40 and married blows... You might have a better time just staring at a blank screen reflecting on anything or nothing.

B00936A0RU|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />So I recently got around to watching Lawless for the first time and I must admit I was pretty impressed. Going in I wasn't really sure what to expect. I don't remember seeing any trailers leading up to its release and I ultimately had no clue what it was about. All I really knew was that Shia LaBeouf was in it. While the film probably won't find its way into my list of favorites, it's hard not to appreciate just how good it actually is.<br /><br />Based on a true story, what isn't these days, Lawless follows the lives of the three Bondurant brothers during the prohibition era. Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke), and Jack (LaBeouf) run a moonshine business and while these three actors may not look similar in appearance, their chemistry on screen more than makes up for it. Forrest is the oldest, and possibly the wisest, Howard is a hothead, and Jack is pretty much the runt of the group who lacks the fearlessness that his brothers have. The movie lets you know this from the get-go as a younger Jack is unable to pull the trigger on a pig on his dad's farm.<br /><br />Everything seems to be going ok for the three brothers until Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) comes along. Charlie is a deputy from Chicago who was sent to crack down on the bootlegging currently going on in Franklin County, Virginia. Even though I hated his character with a passion Pearce did a phenomenal job at bringing this character to life, which seems to be a common theme among the entire cast.<br /><br />As I watched the film part of me felt that Jack was supposed to be the main character. He was the one you were supposed to care about the most, but I found it hard to do that when Tom Hardy comes through and just dominates his performance as Forrest. I don't remember the last time I've seen an actor get so into his character. Off the top of my head I can only think of two: Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 50/50.As I watched the film on the couch I truly felt intimidated by Forrest. Here was a man who did not give a single damn. He didn't do what he did because he wanted to, he does it out of necessity. Out of his sheer will to live. Hardy's character doesn't necessarily have a lot of dialogue, but sometimes it's his silence or his facial expressions that say more than any dialogue ever could.<br /><br />Some minor roles include Maggie (Jessica Chastain), Bertha Minnix (Mia Wasikowska), Cricket (Dane DeHaan), and Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman). Just like the main cast these supporting actors give outstanding performances. Maggie is a former dancer from Chicago who wanted to get away from the city life. She winds up being the waitress at the Bondurant gas station and also, later on, Forrest's love interest. Bertha is a young Amish woman who Jack is obviously attracted to. At first I thought that her role felt forced and insignificant, but it later proves to be more important than I initially thought. Cricket is a friend of Bondurant brothers who helps with their moonshine business. And Floyd Banner is a mobster who later becomes an ally to Jack. As previously stated, each of these actors brought their A-game. However, it would be criminal of me if I didn't give a little bit of recognition to Gary Oldman. The man has maybe a total of 20 lines throughout the entire movie, but, just like Hardy, he put it all on the table. He made himself Floyd Banner and he's just a joy to watch.<br /><br />As a whole I felt the story was solid. The only part that really annoyed me was that they had a main character (Jack) who is unable to do what needs to be done until the situation gets as bad as it could possibly get. I don't know about anyone else, but to me that whole scenario is extremely overdone in movies like this. It says it's based on a true story, but there was obviously some tweaks made to make it a better cinematic experience. There were a few scenes that felt slightly unnecessary, but all in all everything flowed together really well and was presented by some nearly flawless camera work. The cherry on top? Well that would have to be the fantastic score produced by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. It has that classic Country-Western vibe without feeling overwhelming and there were a few times during the darker scenes where I felt chills rush down my spine.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - Considering I had little to no knowledge about this movie going in I have to admit that the final result was more than satisfying. The story may not be perfect, but it's held together by some good pacing, a strong cast, a great score, and some phenomenal acting. If you're into gangster-esque films and you have two hours to kill I definitely recommend giving this this a shot.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed this read. Quick, easy, and just deep enough. Look forward to seeing the movie! I usually try to read books before the movie to try to figure out how they adapted it and if it was well done. So far the only book movie combo that US a true win is the Harry potter series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is such a good series. All of the characters are fleshed out and we get to see the servants' lives as they cater to the rich as well as their rich employers' lives. For the most part they are all good people with good morals but no show would be good without a couple of villains. Downton Abbey is almost a character in itself. It's a beautifu mansion that the Crawley family lives in and safeguards. When the two heirs are killed, the Crawley's  immediately start looking for the next in line to inherit. The young man in this coveted position is not a member of the aristocracy and it almost seems like too much for him to take in. His strong willed mother recognizes what a huge opportunity this is for her son and guides him as they travel to see the estate.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this series is how some of the characters grow. I've only seen the first two season so I still have a ways to go. In the beginning, I couldn't stand Mary. I thought she was a spoilt brat with no regard for anybody but herself. She treated one of her sisters horribly and ruined her chances for marriage a couple of times. I had no sympathy for Mary. Yet as the series progressed, I began to dislike her less. She shows she does have compassion and feelings. I'm still not a Mary fan but I can at least watch her scenes without gritting my teeth.<br /><br />There is such a difference in the two classes. The servants have very little chance for a life of their own. There is a couple who are my favorites on the program. The valet, Bates, who walks with a limp, is a wonderful man with so much kindness. His love interest on the show is one of the maids and she is his equal in this regard. I love their scenes and get upset when things go wrong for them. There are two other servants who like nothing better than to cause trouble for them or anybody else, for that matter.<br /><br />If you like English period pieces with World War I as a backdrop, you will love this program. I recommend it very highly. If you like constant action and shoot 'em ups with dirty language and graphic sex, this program won't interest you. Please give it a try if you are of the former frame of mind.very highly. If you like constant action and shoot 'em ups with dirty language and graphic sex, this program won't interest you.

0938045768|5.0|The zero to hero plan looks very well thought out.  As I move up in steps, I can see it getting progressively more difficult.  But the conditioning you do prior to each step is a logical and well thought out process.  So, though I do not think I'll be able to do every ste with relative ease because I completed the step before it, I think my body will be more well prepared.  The only hard part is to get over your mental hang ups.  Most peope can do push ups and doing wall push ups seems a bit useless.  But, the author recommends doing all the steps regardless if you can do push ups already and stop yourself from jumping ahead.  I'm doing all the step 1s regardless if I can do the other steps...simply because I don't want a voice telling me  &#34;I told you so&#34; if I can't make it to the end.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I haven't finished yet, but even if things bottomed-out now, I've gotten my monies worth.  Nice graphics, nice mystery, good puzzles -  not an overload of hidden object games.  I haven't had to consult a walkthrough, yet, because the in-game help feature has helped guide me when I'm not sure where to go next and don't want to ramble through all the locations.  The puzzles even have instructions when needed - I've played some games where you have to guess what they want you to do.  If you like guessing, you can do that, the instructions aren't automatically shown, you have to click on the instruction button.  Another feature I like is the map.  Not only does it help you maneuver, it lets you know if there is something in that area that needs to be done.  When I'm finished, I'll be looking for more games like this - I hope Big Fish Games is consistent with the quality of their games like this one.

B002E0JL4A|5.0|When Robin Williams stars in a movie with both drama and comedy he usually does well.  He takes it a step farther in this movie.

I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|The amp is small, stylish and practical.

B001AQMBNC|4.0|Starman is probably John Carpenter's most commercially successful film, and it deserves the accolades.  Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen give fantastic performances, and really that is the major draw of this film.  This is a great film to introduce someone to science fiction, as it's a good story with endearing performances and is very light on &#34;sci-fi&#34; effects and such.  The film could be downright silly in the wrong hands, as it's essentially E.T. for adults, the Jeff Bridges perfect performance and John Carpenter's sure direction make for a winner.<br /><br />The blu-ray on the other hand is a disappointment.  The only highlight is that you get the film enhanced for 16x9, as the previously available DVD was a chopped up pan & scan (I REFUSE to use the term &#34;full screen&#34;, that term is criminally inaccurate as we are no longer in 1997).  The picture is fairly soft and flat, but nothing horrible.  I've seen worse, but I've seen better.  On the bright side the transfer is fairly clean, and really, you aren't buying Starman as a reference quality disc anyway.  Audio is fine, dialog is clear and the score is beautiful.  There are no extras of any kind which is both hugely disappointing and mind boggling.  Carpenter has commentaries available on most of his releases, and they are always entertaining, so I don't understand why there is not one recorded for his most commercially successful film.  Disappointing.<br /><br />To sum up, if you love the movie then this is an easy purchase, just remember that you are getting the movie and nothing else.  Still recommended.

B007N8RULO|1.0|Not the regular Spider Solitaire I know...this game I don't know how to play...awful and a lot of Ads.. It's a strange game to me.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|i think Two Graves is one of the best pendergast book yet. i would higly recommend it. five star reading
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was amazing and gives hounding sight on how Osama Bin Laden was killed always thank a Soldier! They sacrifice for us
B009LMTDL0|4.0|My family is and has always been a priority. It is a logical fallacy to declare that women must choose. Widowed at 38 and working for a publicly held corporation meant leaning in on work and family and that other parts of life were necessarily subordinate. Like Maslow's hierarchy of needs, choices are available when basic necessities of life are met. Correlating the energy or will to lean in only to belief systems or institutional change may also be myopic. The book meets one of its stated intentions - starting the discussion. Women are worth the investment and the returns on educating, promoting and mentoring women achievers generates real results.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Fabulous performance by Washington. Good story, believable characters. Less maudlin than Cage's Leaving Los Vegas. Could watch the whole flight scene a dozen times more!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I picked this up on the suggestion of a friend.  It's a good, fast read, and I'm hoping the rest of the series is this good.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|I was not able to play the 3d video on my Pasasonic THX 3d plasma HDTV, or with my Panasonic 3d player.  The screen just stayed on the update firmware screen.  My TN is a 2010 model.  I have the latest firimware  for both my 3d video player and 3d plasma HDTV<br /><br />The 3d Titanic played beautifully.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I decided to download Feedly because Google Reader wasn't going to be available to use a time from now. Well, I am very impressed and glad to say that G Reader can be out of service and I know that I'm going to have all my feeds loaded in the same place with a very nice design too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and love having it on my kindle.  occassional crash and slow pinning/load issues.  But otherwise a great app.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|THIS IS SO STUPID!!! I TRY TO DOWNLOAD THIS GAME BUT NOOO I STILL A SAVED STUFF ON MY KINDLE THATS TAKE UP SPACE AND NOW EVERY GAME THATS PAID I CANT GET OR REINSTALL!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is  a sweet movie about life and things that we go through. Part of it is filmed in Ireland and is a good way to visit if you've never been their.If you have been to Ireland as I have you can revisit and relive the memories. There is a message of hope and how to go on with your life after it has knocked you down.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I bought the full version before the free addition time expired and played a couple of chapters before finally having to close for the time being. When I attempted to resume my game, it would not reload to where I left off.  This game is a little pricey to have these problems. I never did get it to load and did not get to complete it. Customer service was of no help. I have reset my Kindle Fire numerous times and it still will not load. Not worth the hassle.
B0010T75W6|5.0|I adore this movie.  This movie has something for everyone.  It's joyful, tragic, and has the most amazing music you will hear in a long while.  I stumbled upon this movie years ago, by accident, and I am certainly glad that I did.  John Cameron Mitchell is inspired in the role of Hedwig.  It's definitely worth renting, but I'm sure you will want to see it again after the first time, so buying it is really the way to go.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Five stars This was better than the movie was and the best book I ever read can't wait to read the next book in the series
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie has everything.. romance, suspense, drama, and heartbreak. It's one of the rare movies that is almost as good as the book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing adventure filled with twists and turns that keep you on your toes , not being able to stop, and wanting more
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This live recording from the O2 Arena in London is an absolutely wonderful experience. Alfie Bow and Samantha Bark are standouts in this rendition. I watch it over and over for the pure beauty of the voices and music.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|Great mystery movie. Very well thought out and had the right amount of humor. No one plays Hercule Poirot better than Peter Ustinov.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Any CGI animated films look great on Blu ray, and Brave is no exception.  The quality is crystal clear, the film itself is superb, and it's loaded with lots of enjoyable extras.  Highly recommended!
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|A great classic that speaks to the soul. Written in a tone that has stood the test of time. I certainly would recommend this book to anyone.
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|It doesn't come with a lot of extras, but the Blu Ray quality of the movie is all I cared about when ordering this.  Completely satisfied!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|While this book was a fast read, it was highly thought provoking and left me wanting more.  I hope there will be a follow up book from Dr. Alexander.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find this for free on Amazon Prime and loved the plot and love story that developed, I also liked the sense of revolution that developed during the game and the rebellion of the heroes at the end. I'm glad I watched it and I might watch it again.
0812993845|4.0|We start off with our heroine, Lottie out for a romantic dinner with her boyfriend Richard.  He has a big question for her so she believes this to be the ultimate \\"BIG\\" question....Will you marry me?  Caught up in the moment she accepts and Richard becomes extremely confused, because he has not actually asked her....So, the big break-up occurs......<br /><br />As Lottie outlines her horrific night and fills in her sister Felicity (Fliss), Fliss starts to feel more and more protective of her sister and knows of her past patterns when she has had failed relationships and disappointments.  So, she is extra protective when she finds out that Lottie very shortly after the break-up receives a call from a boyfriend she had during her gap year, where she & Ben toured around the Greek Islands.  It's been 15 years but they decide to meet and hit it off again in no time.  Much to Fliss's chagrin, she finds that they get married and are soon off on their honeymoon, back in Greece.  The bulk of the novel then takes them through the crazy idea that Fliss has to prevent them from consummating their marriage so that they can still get it annulled-sure that in her sister's long list of wrong turns this one would be at the top.  As an editor of a travel magazine, she speaks with her contact at the hotel to promise a full page spread and lots of publicity if they can just keep the two apart, and they do, to some crazy extents.<br /><br />Now, this is the kind of book where it is not really believable, the overly friendly, helpful staff that is always there for every need would have to go and the twin bed issue would have had me out the door and to the next hotel, so is it believable, no, but if you are looking for just fun, escapist fiction without a lot of heavy plotlines and complicated twists and turns, a sheer pleasure read, this is good.  Just a fun and fluffy kind of read.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoy Sophie Kinsella, you know what to expect from her books, with her wit, romance and charm.  I say, it is a perfect book to just sit back and do a little guilty pleasure reading!
B0046MOVD0|4.0|If you liked all the others.This one will entertain you as well.A very good series for a video game based movie.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Tom Selleck is an all time favorite of mine.  He plays an interesting character in Night Passage.  I enjoyed watching the relationships with his police department staff and town folks evolve.  And how about that dog.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great movie,If you're a fan of The Lord of the Rings trilogy like me.You will enjoy this movie from start to finish.Look very forward to the next installment.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. In fact, it is addicting as it gets harder and harder, the higher game level you play!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Very enjoyable. Excellent cast and good storyline.  Makes for a fun light  evening, until i start to ponder my approaching<br />Retirement years.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Most action comes only at the end. Tension builds erratically. Still, it is another satisfying Novel for real Reacher fans.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Cool book it was cool how they busted out of the games<br />I say let the rebellion begin<br />The End
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|All the actors in this movie were stellar, but Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hitchcock was amazing.  He looked the part, sounded the part . Hopkins was more Hitchcock than Hitchcock himself.<br /><br />Another thing that was unique/interesting about the movie was Hitchcock's obsession with the real-life basis for the Psycho movie, Ed Gein.  This obsession was shown in dream sequences where Hitchcock interacted with Gein.  These scenes were both gruesome and funny.  Hitchcock's marital problems with his wife Alma (played by Helen Mirren who also gave a stellar performance), were also a highlight of the movie.  These scenes were touching, heart-breaking and at time hilarious.<br /><br />So all-in-all a very good movie.  Not a blockbuster, but a movie well worth the time and money.
1433502410|5.0|I would not recommend using it as a primary bible.  However, in conjunction with other translations, you are able to obtain a better understanding of the scriptures.  I recommend it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great Series... miss it already!<br />It had all the necessary elements. Sci-Fi, Serious, Romance, Funny all in the right balance.<br />Too bad it is all over now!<br />Watch it and enjoy though!
B0063M22QO|4.0|My first Mahjong for the new Kindle and the game is good with many options.  What held me back on the rating was that the game doesn't save your progress,, so every time you start you have to remember the last screen you played and scroll through the games to find it.
B00190OHD6|5.0|this was a very heart warming, loving, tear making movie. i loved hillary so innocent and fun. good story line. all the characters were great.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Why do we need to have a minimum amount of words to discribe somehting when the headline says it all?
B0081336FO|5.0|Such a great show! It's a visual treat and you never know what's going to happen next. Can't wait for next season!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Why do we need to have a minimum amount of words to discribe somehting when the headline says it all?
B009QW7YEI|3.0|...too contrived, if that is possible for a Bond movie, after all, they are all contrived. .  The  Carter Media conglomerate instigate world shaking political  'events', and then is the first to report, all in the name of power and money... Bond looking a bit tired in this, but the women and the gadgets, well, as always, they hold their own...
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Why do we need to have a minimum amount of words to discribe somehting when the headline says it all?
B005LAIIHG|1.0|I felt there was no purpose to the film whatsoever. it did prove that Pi was one helluva swimmer! But even that was not realistic.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Why do we need to have a minimum amount of words to discribe somehting when the headline says it all?
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Though a similar story has been told and the use of pioneer living combined with 22nd century as a backdrop has been done countless times. When its over it was good. Jennifer Lawrence's authenticity is probably why.
B0064QNS62|1.0|Not worth the free app. What else can I say? I am just filling in words now for the minimum requirement.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|l'm very happy with my purchase but l've found that the prices in the stores had come down just around the time l received it.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|A lot of the literature that covers the subject of introverts tends to be very self-congratulatory and views extroversion as a negative character trait. This avoids all the posturing and gets down to the details of both axes of personality. Well written and engaging.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|great app,  fun for everyone.  beware,  it's very addicting! I would recommend it to anyone with kids or anyone who likes a little challenge.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|With a realistic voice, and a quick pace, this book keeps you glued until the end. Don't pass this one up. If you like gripping, realistic science fiction set in the near future, definitely pick this up.
B0073COMKW|5.0|I've bought 12 units and despite other comments saying part of the package not worked, I have no problem with mine so far.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I love the app. The reason I gave it four out of five stars is after you take a picture you can not see the picture.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I just started but so far its ok<br /> a little confusing at first. not really sure of the objective but graphics are good.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have been waiting for this app sooooo long for like a year finally it comes out! The app works perfect and it doesn't freeze up this game is awesome the only thing I don't like is that the app says you can anything and you can make a lot of stuff but not anything BUY THE APP.  -TEKNOkitten
8866134627|5.0|They made some great changes with the table of contents and the way that the pages are set up. Very good for the professional setting.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Sharpens most things I've tried.  Even honed up a pair of scissors.  Worth the money you pay.  Would buy it again.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Very good acting by all.  It was different but had a lot of good lessons.  Just loved Matilda and Miss Honey.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This was the last piece of my gaming build I was waiting for. I missed some of the recent lower prices, but it works great and didn't have any issues with the build. Seemed to take a long time to ship with free super saver shipping. Larger items seem to arrive much quicker.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cannot stop watching it! I highly recommend owning every series. It is a very good show to watch from the story to the plot.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|I found this a fascinating read, yes it's a bit long winded, but it's good. At times entertaining, at times academic,  but always interesting.
B003MYYJD0|3.0|Eyecatching and big, but a little too eye catching for me.  The gold accents on the band along with the size of the face just were too much.  But if bling is what you are looking for it sure draws your attention.  A  big wrist would help.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Amazing simply beautiful love!!! One of my favorite books now so happy the second book is out now! I just ordered it can't wait to start reading!!
B000HKYN74|5.0|best plot lines, loved the joint ventures, even a little romance with Trip & Topol.<br /><br />I didn't watch this when it was first broadcast on tv, but thoroughly enjoyed watching every episode on prime. thanks!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Can not stop playing this game. Fun and easy to play with lots of rewards and power ups. Would recommend to anyone who likes action games.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I  couldn't find this dvd anywhere. I checked store's very week, with no luck. so when I found it online for 20 $ I was happy. the dvd came on time . I brought it new. the movie is funny and awesome, it made me want to see live music like this at my local college.  I can't stop watching it, or listening to the music! diffenetly a great flim!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very attractive it causes limitless amounts of time to be consumed when your not doing anything else.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Personally I love the show! I love everything about it. season 3 was awesome! A lot of surprising moments. Some sad. Has a little bit of everything!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Haven't watched the entire season yet but really like what I've watched so far.  Otherwise I would give it five stars but you can't rate what you haven't seen.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|Overall very good album. Best songs are Nabataea, Burning Sun, and Waiting for the Thunder and the lyrics for the songs Far From the Stars and Church Breaks Down are quite interesting and thought provoking. There are however some rather silly lyrics as well so the end product is a bit uneven but worth the money.
0385537697|5.0|this erotic trilogy was nothing I've ever read before. the moment I was finished reading I wanted to begin re-reading the captivating love story immediately.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It is another great product from Google. It works just as good on my Kindle as well as my IPhone.
B007U8U1V8|4.0|Another solid effort from Jack White.  This release falls in line with what you expect from Jack White.  Give hyprocitical kiss a spin.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I didn't think it was written very well. It focused on a lot of trivial details training rather than on the main event. It left out the burial at sea which I think would have been crucial to the ending.
0881036366|5.0|I've never read anything like it. I was transported to another world, where humans interact on a more complex level. I can't wait to read more of Herbert's books.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|As always this auther kept you enthraled with every page, also nice to have a little romance in it this time can't wait to read the next books
0439023521|5.0|Fantastic read and interesting commentary on society. Finished it in just a couple of days. However, I hear a lot of young kids are reading it. It's pretty graphic so I'd recommend to be at least in high school.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|well I think this game is great but the charecter Sidney is so expensive all I have is 5,090 is it even possible to get her?!other than that its well thought out :-)
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I had seen the advertisement for the Jack Reacher movie starring Tom Cruise and decided to read the book first. Little did I realize that Lee Child started this series in the late 90's. My neighbor told me how great the series was, so I stopped the book and decided to download book #1, Killing Floor. I'm now finishing up book 6!<br /><br />The Jack Reacher novels have been the most entertaining books I have read in a long time and I do allot of reading. Reacher himself has so many quirks it's hard to make him out. He's Ex Military Police ( CID ) and has left the service after 13 years. A military brat that has never stayed in one place for long and has decided not to plant roots. Just walks around seeing the country living off of cash, staying in cheap motels (usually) checking in using the names of Presidents. He's a guy with a heart of gold..or a hard ass breaking a head or two, not that they didn't need it. Walks right into bad situations unintentionally and that's where it gets fun. He has a good and bad attitude at the same time and a very fair sense of justice. They need killing? That will work for him!<br /><br />My only qualm is that Lee Child being from The U.K., needed a few Geography lessons in some of his later books. Not every road in New Jersey touches on Interstate 95! Leaving Atlantic City, you don't jump on 95 to get to NYC. That's the Garden State Parkway. Being from Joisey, I picked those little things out right away. Now I look for \\"all roads lead to 95!\\". Actually, it has added a bit more fun to the books for me.!<br /><br />So if you want to get hooked on the best series I have read in years, do buy Killing Floor. I know I'm hooked. I have at least 8 or 9 more to go and I'm looking forward to every single one of them!<br /><br />PS....Don;t forget to read the introduction. I have a tendency to skip over it and get right into the first chapter. Lee Child describes how he left television, started writing novels and how Jack Reacher came to be. Amazing!
B00BI745AA|3.0|The singing is okay but not great and the acting is overdone but the production is stunning. If you really want to experience Les Mis, see it on the stage.
B000FA675C|4.0|You here this all the time so getting the book after, a while after seeing the movie was something I don't normally do. But was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the action and plot twists even more.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I had heard a lot about this movie, and it didn't appeal to me at all. Travelling to India, I had time to watch a lot of movies. I didn't choose Life of Pi, but saw it on other passengers screens almost non-stop during the very long flights. I figured I had seen the whole movie without sound. I still didn't want to see it. When I got home, my wife and I were looking for a movie to download, and she had wanted to see it. Mostly curious to put a soundtrack to what I had seen on over 40 ours of flights, I agreed. It was a beautiful movie, unique, stunning, raising some very interesting questions and ways to think about things. I thoroughly enjoyed. I suggest watching it with the soundtrack :-)
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Couldn't even finish it, boring characters, predictable plot and poor grammar.  This might be palatable for children but any serious fantasy reader will want to claw their eyes out and get the half they wasted starting the book back.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|While the story has some points that are worth thinking about afterwards, overall I was disappointed.  Perhaps if I had seen the movie in a theater, in 3D I would have enjoyed it more, although that would haven't changed the story line.
B005DJREJS|5.0|You'll love Awkward…<br /><br />No Ducky, Uncle Buck or Long Duk Dong but all the Characters are as lovable or is some cases hate able…
1439102813|5.0|Often, the test of a book is what I think of it a year later.<br /><br />I read this book about 18 months ago, and I still find myself thinking about it, or telling others about it.<br /><br />The book really helps to shed light on Alzheimers and left me wondering what I would do if it was me.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|True to his writing style from begaining to end, Dan Brown keeps you at the edge of your seat during his entire presentation. Just when you think you know what will happen next----he comes at you with an unexpected surprise.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|the very popular series in it's third season with a very heartbreaking series of events is part of my regular repeated watchings. great acting, wonderful production and compelling writing make this a must have.
B001458MI2|5.0|Of all the music Christina has done, this CD shows the range of her abilities and musical talent. She really brings a great modern twist to the Big Band sound. I love all the different types of music genres she has on this album. This is one album I can listen to over and over again.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Movie and we got it right after it was released. Was glad we had it so quickly and did not have to go waste $ at a chain store for it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Penny for penny you would be hard pressed to find a more entertaining read - Mark's sense of humor is probably the only thing that kept him sane Through all of the sols. Nice job Andy!!
B000G0O5N2|5.0|This is my hubby's favorite movie so I upgraded it to blu-ray for him last Christmas. Came sealed and packed, brand new as described.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is the first time I have ever given a review, so sorry if it is difficult to understand. I thought this book was amazing. I thought it started a little slow but now that I am done, I am very glad I continued to read. Nicholas Sparks did a fabulous job. It is a heart warming and touching story!! I loved it and highly recommend it!!!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Series. The Set could have been packed a bit better but the product was NOT damaged. Great value overall! Thanks
B0087JTAKW|5.0|&#34;Time flies&#34; when you're in the hands of a skilled novelist. Enjoyed this world and its suspension of time very much. Would recommend this book to a friend.
B00B2166BS|5.0|If you have a Nexus 10 you will find this very useful. I am told that charging speed is faster with this connector than with USB. I have not done any timing so cannot verify that. However it is much easier to connect to the tablet and is not wearing out the USB connector.  I find this far more convenient to use and now only use the USB connector when I need to transfer data. As far as I know this is only supplying power, not data.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Perfect for everyday use! The memory of past calculating is helpful if you make a mistake. The size of the keys is just what I need and when doing basic math, I don't have  to worry about accidentally hitting one of those extraneous keys I don't use (sine, cosine, tangent)!!
B0026KX6TY|5.0|A beautiful film that will capture your heart well carried on the small shoulders of a captivating little gray eyed wonder named Max Pomeranc. He most certainly doesn't radiate I'm a child star, look at me. The marjority of his charisma is those expressive eyes and well portrayed empathy for not only his own family but all those he meets.<br />  Even if led out by a excellent director this boy needs the core for which he may draw and he rises to the challenge without crossing over to maudlin while retaining a strength far beyond his years.<br /> Especially touching is his part time friendship with one of his weekly chess mates and some rather intense scenes between him, his father, and his coach.<br />No less spectacular is the battle between parents over what's best for our mite sized chess prodigy.<br />Altogether if this film doesn't draw you in maybe you're just watching the wrong film...
B004XC5LP0|4.0|So many have already provided summaries and opinions on the plot, etc.  I only focus and rate a film's transfer to Blu Ray.  Hope it fits  your needs.<br /><br />I picked this one up at the local big box store for $6.00 to limit the risk regarding this popcorn movie.  It was a risk well taken.<br /><br />The video has far more pluses than minus'.  The colors are, for the most part, bright and well contrasted.  I am sure they popped the colors a touch in post production.  No artifacts that I could see, however, and especially early on, I did notice a bit of motion blur in the first chapter of the film that was to have been a volcanic eruption in a Columbian town.  That did seem to settle down and I really can't say that I noticed it further into the movie.  The Mbps rate seemed to average in the high teens to low 20s which means that they really didn't do any real remastering.  There is a function where, if you missed some of the dialogue, you hit the remote's yellow button.  I did at one point and a subtitle of the dialogue came up but would not go away.  It actually crashed the Blu Ray player.  This is the first time I have ever seen that or had that happen.  I will stay away from that function for the future.  I repowered the Blu Ray player and all was well from then on.  Overall, the video transfer rates a 4 from me.<br /><br />The audio will also be a 4 or 4.5.  It was a lossless DTS MA 5.1  The dialogue was clear and easy to hear and understand....in most places.  There were a couple of scenes where the soundtrack overpowered the dialogue and this brings down its rating from me.  However, there was some really fine tracking of foley effects and discreet directionality making use of the entire sound system, especially so during the final volcano eruption and all that ensued afterwoods.  Some excellent panning of audio between the front and rear stages as well as from left to right. For sure, your LFE sub channel will be put to great use.<br /><br />Extras included in this Universal disc include commentary, trailer and a few short docs on casting, the science of vulcanology, some interviews et al.  Lots of wasted disc space from Universal's Blu Ray gimmick interactive nonsense that I doubt many will use as well as previews/ads for other movies.  This could have been devoted to a higher mbps rate for a cleaner video transfer.<br /><br />And that's all she wrote folks.  Hope this review was helpful to you in deciding upon your purchase.  For me, it was worth the money.ed in this Universal disc include commentary, trailer and a few short docs on casting, the science of vulcanology, some interviews et al.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|A really good F2P that is still fun without forcing you to make any purchases. Loading screens take a bit time though.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Who knew that Brandon Sanderson could write a story in less than three hundred thousand words?<br /><br />The focus of the story is on exploring a magic system that is focused on &#34;what could have been,&#34; both for everyday objects and for people.<br /><br />Shai is a great character to teach us about Soulforging, and the pacing keeps you reading all the way to the end.<br /><br />This is a great book to start with if you aren't sure whether you'll like Brandon Sanderson or not.  It's got strong character drama, an interesting magic system, and some neat action sequences, all hallmarks of Brandon's style.  If you like this book, it's a good bet that you'll like the other things he writes.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|I really enjoyed the series as it shows the old ways of the differences in class how the less fortu.nate served the upper class, feelings and relationships of both.<br /><br />Really not a difference when you really look into it.<br />Funny and dry humor.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This author never, ever disappoints me.  This was well written and suspenseful.  Who needs more?  Harry Bosch is just the best and most interesting detective out there.

B0074JOCIG|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this.  If you're in it for the music & not all the extras, buy this one.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|At first hard to see. But challenging and u get used to the tiles. It's enjoyable. But I do not understand the levels.
B00ARX2W24|5.0|Herb Alpert better than  ever before.  The music is fun, exciting, and as beautifully played as any I've ever heard.  Truly Herb Alpert is one of the greatest undervalued trumpeters of the 20th Century.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes Latin, dance, or just the best listening music.
B007KLKFSO|4.0|Not your typical teen love story. Eleanor and Park gives an innovative treatment to the often stereo-typed depiction of 'high-school boy meets girl and they fall in love'. Both characters are flawed and not always likeable, both are isolated in their own way. While an unlikely couple on paper, in practice their pairing becomes life changing for both of them. This story has a real charm about it and draws you into their difficult worlds.
B0043RH8JC|5.0|Words cannot describe John Lennon's music.  It is timeless and although he sings so effortlessly it is brilliant.  Imagine will always be the theme song of my dreams as I watch my daughters grow.
B00821OX98|4.0|Chose to watch this show on a whim.  At first I felt the setting, characters, and story were a little too boring.  I chose to keep watching throughout the season and ended up enjoying this show immensely.  The effects aren't the best out there, but that doesn't matter too much.  Watch this show for a few episodes and the characters grow on you (at least they did for me).  Definitely recommended for the sci-fi people out there.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I find this app a bit of a challenge but also rewarding when I have been able to release the birds and move on to the next level.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not stop reading, had to force myself away, finished the book fast and eager to read the next two books. Highly recommended.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app has given me some very pleasant, peaceful moments spent in putting together the puzzles. The level of difficulty is just where it needs to be.
B00275EGX8|5.0|The film is about the men in the Rademacher family from Downstate Decatur. Jake, the oldest, always planned to go into the military, but didn't make it into West Point and found himself as an actor. Isaac, the next, graduated top of his class at West Point and married his classmate Jenny. Joe, next in line, enlisted and was top of his class at Army Ranger school. The brothers were very close growing up, but Jake sensed a distance growing as they came home on leave. He felt he could never know their experienc

B005TTEFRG|5.0|A quest that begins as a personal vendetta for the fierce Cimmerian warrior soon turns into an epic battle against hulking rivals, horrific monsters, and impossible odds, as Conan realizes he is the only hope of saving the great nations of Hyboria from an encroaching reign of supernatural evil.
B000MDDSB8|4.0|Very good movie if your into the Paranormal,hot young guys & alot of action.I like it enough to not only have it in Blu-Ray but bought it for my Kindle device.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The author took a different and clever approach to telling this story.  It alternates first-person accounts by the husband and by the wife.  I found it to be a real page-turner.  Hard to put down.<br /><br />The way the author chose to end this tale is controversial.  Enough said.  Read it and decide for yourself what you think about the ending.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Constantly wondering what will happen next. And why. Intriguing. Unique. Suspenseful. Starting book 3 now.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Ten years later, this show still has it. Fox really screwed up by canceling this show. It had the makings of a Star Trek franchise.

B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is a great movie. Love it and definitely recommend it.  I would love to watch it again and again.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This in an interesting story of an orphan boy's journey of survival through life. It is set in the early 1970's in Ireland. It is told through a series of back flashes as James the main character fights depression after the death of the uncle. There are moments throughout the book that make you want to keep reading. You need to find out what happens next.  It is unsettling to read about the horrors the orphans experience and that the events were based on real life accounts. As a Catholic,myself, it is humiliating and disturbing that such evil can exist under the disguise of religion.  I want to assure readers that most Catholics are kind hearted pious individuals. I have had nothing but good experiences with kind nuns and priests I have known in my almost 50 years. Every religion and society)has its \\"bad apples\\". We need to pray for these individuals and especially their victims.<br />  The book has a nice pace and is light hearted at times. It has a touching turn of events and ends postively. It is worth the read.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Very interesting take on making Richard III a hero and Elizabeth Woodville the villian. Phiippa Gregory is the Queen of historical fiction

0988262592|5.0|If you have any involvement with Information Technology in a large corporation, you need to read The Phoenix Project or you will be left behind. This will spur a revolution in how IT is run, and how IT relates to other departments. It was written as a novel, so it goes down easy. If your reading queue is long, bump this up to your next read. You can thank me later.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a great book. I don't understand how anyone would rate it 1 or 2 stars. It definitely isn't as good as Harry Potter, but it isn't a copy of it. All of my friends have read it, and after they finished it they are coming to school being all like,  \\"omigoshthatwasthebestbookever!!!!!!!!\\" Then, at recess, \\"let's play Percy Jackson. I'll be Annabeth and you can be Grover.\\" And, \\" Me be Grover? Can't I at least be Chiron?\\" As you can see, we are all obsessed with Percy Jackson. I have read all of the books in this series, and all of the heroes of Olympus series, and all of the Kane chronicles books. I love them all and think that this particular book is good for anyone who likes mystical and magical books that are packed with action.

B0064MGU98|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows, the characters are great, it's a good mix between family and job and how a middle age woman copes with major drama in her life.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie surprised me.  I wasn't expecting to like it.  I thought it would be a badly done chick-flick, but I was wrong.  The movie was well written and superbly acted.  Emma Watson makes you forget she ever played a famous witch and Logan Lerman and Ezra Miller delivered stunning performances. (Especially Ezra Miller who was amazing) The story is dark, and sad, but it has truly funny moments and even sweet moments mixed in.  The film was spectacular.
B000FA675C|5.0|Love it. One of my favorites. An expert mix of fact and fiction, done is such a way that it is difficult to tell which is which.
1609611543|1.0|I found the read interesting but he lost me half way through.  What I can't get past is that he spends a great deal of time 'proving' how bad modern dwarf wheat is by pointing out how healthy pre-1950 people are compared to present-day people.  But when asked (on his website) why not just go back to the traditional (heirloom) wheat that those people ate, he then says NO!! because ALL wheat is bad for you.<br /><br />You can't have it both ways.  The book comes off as a thinly disguised anti-grain agenda.<br /><br />I suspect that modern wheat IS less safe.  I know from my own experience that when I started eating white home-made bread on a daily basis, after a few months (and additional weight gain) my digestive tract was worse for the wear.  Once changing to a plant-centered diet, and an additional 6 months, the pain started to go away.  But that doesn't mean all wheat/grains are bad for you and that alternative methods (sprouting, soaking) won't make wheat easier to digest.  Personally, I love bread and am not ready to give up.  I am trying sprouting and soaking wheat and have started grinding my own flour.  Such a difference from buying at the store!  I also plan on purchasing heirloom wheat when the crop is in this year.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|This book is written simply, so it was an easy read. It's nice to have a great story that doesn't require a lot of thought, sometimes.
B0013HA838|5.0|This is one of the best that I have seen - the entire cast is wonderful, and the staging is better than some others that I have seen and owned.  You know how, sometimes, the roles are well performed except for one critical role?  I have been disappointed in the past, but I am quite pleased with this production.  I am happy to have this DVD in my opera collection.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is easy to use.  Love all the different Bilble Study Plans.  I was surprised when I figured out it will read it to you if you want.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I enjoyed the James Bond 007 movie. I was impressed with the Master-audio sound effects as well as the clear vocals.<br />The video was crisp & clear with excellent black reproduction by my Panasonic plasma HDTV & DVD player.<br />There were substantial &#34;extras&#34; included with the movie, much more than the few meager deleted scenes normally included with blu-ray DVDs.<br />4.5/5 stars (★★★★½)<br /><br />dvd player.

0375869026|5.0|I loved this book because it made me think about the way we treat each other and especially those who look or act differently than the norm.  I especially enjoyed reading it from the changing perspectives of several characters.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who interacts with others.  That's all of us!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I adored this book. It's the best I've read in years. I love Irish fiction, and this one just fit the bill.  I loved the humor in it, but at the same time, it made me cry.  The parts of the book that take place in the orphanage just break your heart.  The ending was surprising, but very good and satisfying.  Wasn't too predictable at all.  As I was reading, I kept thinking that I wished they would make this into a movie. And they are!  So excited.

B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|After reading so many spy, criminal, fantacy and other types of novels, it was extremely refreshing<br />to read a book that took me back to a different time in the history of North America.  The story is<br />seen through the eyes of a dog who suddenly finds himself pulling a sled in the Arctic north.  London's<br />dog character Buck could just as well be a person.  You share his feelings of trust, hatred, bewilderment,<br />pride, exhaustion, hope and many more emotions.  Actually, I first stumbled on Jack London's &#34;White Fang&#34;<br />and since I enjoyed it so much, I read The Call of the Wild.  Maybe I even enjoyed &#34;White Fang&#34; more, but that<br />might be because I read it first.  One thing I know is that these won't be the last books I will read from Jack London<br />and I'm not really an adventurous, outdoor type.

B009S33I68|5.0|...not necessarily because it's a literary masterpiece or entertaining but to appreciate what these brave men faced, how well they performed and how fortunate we are to have men like this in our Country.<br />These veterans deserve our thanks for their sacrifice.<br />Thank you to all who have served.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Since we saw it in the theater, we have long awaited this release.  We watched it the night we got it.  Great price, excellent condition, timely delivery for our movie night and we look forward to the next one.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! It is way better than the first temple run. It's better than temple run brave also. There is a different course. You can travel in cart through a mine and collect gems that help you get alive after you die. This game is amazing and FREE, so if for some reason you don't like the game it won't cost you a dime! Enjoy! :)

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Miserables is now one of my all- time favorite musicals. I personally find it to be visually stunning. For example when Javert is singing Stars,in the background you see Notre Dame cathedral. And also when Valjean first gets out on parole you see snowy mountains behind him. Really impressive. The performances in this movie were outstanding. Especially Ann Hathaway. Her voice is incrediable and she sang I dreamed a dream with so much passion and raw emotion that I had tears in my eyes. I was really moved. She really captured Fantine as a character on screen perfectly. Huge Jackman also did a very knock out performance. Though in my poersonnal opinion I think his voice could have been better. He definately can sing and act very well. I was even surprized by Russel Crowe's performance as well. I don't think his voice was bad. Though the other cast members had better voices then him his voice fits Javert. The music is just... unbelieveable. It is superb. Though I do prefer the broadway cast album of the show. (Colm Wilkensen's voice is gorgeous to listen to.) The music here is just as good even though I feel as if it loses some of the way the music is supposed to sound. But still very well done. I could go on  forever about how good this movie is. My only regret is that I did not get a chance to see the play live on broadway. Maybe a revival will happen. Anywho, if you have not seen this film go see it right away. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />*update* Saw the play today (5/17/14) and it was WAY better than the film. Though this film adaptation had greater sets the music was clearer and more beatifull live. There is no comparison than seeing a musical live especially this one.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I couldn't put it down....the best book that I have read in a long time!  I can't wait to read more!

B007FEFLTO|5.0|The book has highlighted some of the dynamics leading up to, during and the conclusion of WWII.  It was historically interesting but lacked reality dealing with some of the fictional character's lives.  Enjoyed the book and had difficulty putting it down.

B00AA2I2NK|5.0|Ludovico Einaudi is an Italian pianist and classical music composer. After training at the Conservatorio Verdi in Milan and under composer Luciano Berio in the early 1980s, Einaudi started his career as a classical composer and soon began incorporating other styles and genres, including pop, rock, world music, and folk music. He composed the scores for a number of films including Intouchables, and I'm Still Here. At the beginning of 2013 he unveiled the long-gestating `In a Time Lapse', which had been recorded in a remote monastery near Verona and saw a return to a more \\"classical\\", chamber music sound.<br /><br />As one critic has stated, `It's not hard to understand why Ludovico Einaudi is one of the world's most successful living classical composers: there's a deeply satisfying emotional logic to his piano-based progressions that makes him as much the inheritor of Chopin and Satie as minimalists such as Glass and Reich. Here, the soothing, trancelike wave motion of tracks like \\"Corale\\" and \\"Run\\" also reflects the calm, considered nature of Albinoni's Adagio, while the more complex, layered pieces such as \\"Life\\" blend cycling piano and glockenspiel against rhapsodic, flowing string lines. Elsewhere, subtle modernist-pop touches appear here and there, in the subliminal background noises lending depth behind the piano and violin of \\"Time Lapse\\", and the pulsing synthesiser of \\"Newton's Cradle\\".<br /><br />Einaudi is joined in this recording with violinist Daniel Hope who in his recent release `Spheres' offers some works by Einaudi.  The entire CD bears the earmark of meditational music - a designator that in times such as these bears our full attention. Grady Harp, April 13

B005FPT51K|1.0|Who runs this company? Your customers are parents of babies, people who would love to be able to reliably monitor their child - as your marketing claims your product will do - and be able to get much needed sleep without interruptions from their so-called baby monitor. Yes, the camera is good but the software app is ridiculously amateur. The updates have been a joke. \\"Bug fixes\\"!? More like \\"bug additions\\"! This product has gone from barely usable to totally useless. All these people complaining about the same things aren't idiots with bad equipment. Sound levels randomly increasing and decreasing, \\"popping\\" over the speakers, disconnects every few hours, necessitating a restart in the middle of the night. Do you read these reviews and the problems people are having? Do you test anything? Are your programmers infants themselves or do you just not care?! The iBABY has been riddled with problems since its release, and this company's failure to supply adequate functioning software and supply customer support beyond the unintelligible level of the included instructions warrants a LAWSUIT.  EPIC FAIL on APPLE for promoting this product and allowing updates to be released that render the software in WORSE condition than before! Buy this product if you enjoy wasting hours troubleshooting at great expense.

B006JPS1OM|2.0|The only reason I could not give this game a better score is because I could not play the game.  After I purchased the game it me off.  I reinstalled it which made me start the game over.  Then played for a while and when I came back the next day to continue, it would not let me play again.  Deleated the game and have not tried to play again.  Played on my Kindle Fire.

B003UBTX7C|5.0|Recently, I read a few of DB newer novels and had been disappointed with both the plots and the characters.  Somehow, I had missed reading Hell's Corner and when I came across it and realized it was part of the Camel Club series, I eagerly snapped it up. Even though the plot is rather simple, the characters are classic DB and this made for a great read. DB can talk for pages without dialog and keep the story moving, but he is at his best when Oliver Stone is interacting with the cast of characters, both good and bad. In my novels, I have tried to emulate the way DB's characters play out the plot, page by page. My new novel, &#34;Methuselah's Secret&#34; is my homage to DB and his early writing style. I think anyone who likes the Camel Club will like it.

B003U4ZQUM|5.0|LOST has got to be in the top 5 best TV series ever. It's so complete. All the back stories are explored fully all loose ends are tide up in the end. It makes you think. It makes you laugh. It makes you cry.<br /><br />You won't find a better show to watch.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Remarkably twisted and wickedly fun; but if you're this far in, you know that already.  Worth reading.  Don't just watch the series.
B000FBJAEG|2.0|Really?  I don't know what else to say but, what in gods name was he thinking with that ending?  Really?
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great Sci Fi series. I hope they can produce more of the same kind for all sci fi lovers.<br />Thank You
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|AActing is wonderful, settings are so detailed.  I learned more bout this period of our history than I thought I would.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book keeps your interest right up until the end.  As always, it's a challenge to try to figure out who done it!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Best new show that I've seen in awhile. I'll definitely be watching every week. It already feels much deeper than the films.
B004AUGJS8|5.0|The cars, the clothes. Flashback to the 70s. Kirsten Dunst's 'Katie' is a walking heart. Her character got in over her head with Ryan Gosling's 'David'. She tried to make a life for them & to fix him. He had a dark heart. She was a bright shining star. Too bad he was psychotic. This movie is a character study rather than a thriller. There is no question about who done it. Her family knew he did it. The questions this movie asks are 'Who were these people?' and 'Why did it end so badly?' This movie sticks with you for weeks after you watch it.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|we never would have watched this if my son hadn't asked if he could see it because he read the book.  Very good movie.  He did, however, like the book better.  That's pretty common I think.
B0041KVZ18|4.0|So I don't rate music on this site, I rate products. Go to a music rating site for music ratings.<br /><br />Anyways, debating if I should return this one. I am sure it is just this copy and not all, but there are two things wrong with it. First is no biggie- the first time through it skipped on a song, but then cleared whatever bump and doesn't skip anymore. Second the beginning has a section that pops until the first song comes on, and you can still hear it ever so faintly, but disappears quickly... shall I be picky, or just accept the flaws for what they are...
B005HEPIDS|5.0|THIS SHOW HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND ALWAYS WILL BE. SEVEN OF NINE IS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER.
B000YXMMAO|4.0|The quality of the cover seems slightly flimsier than your average LP, but other than that the vinyl sounds great.
0143117009|5.0|Jared Diamond can take what seem like some of the most boring topics imaginable (Montanan environmental problems, livestock in Norse Greenland, etc.) and make them not only engaging but relevant. The chapters on Easter Island and Pitcairn & Henderson are haunting, and the inclusion of modern day scenarios are depressingly blunt. However his is ultimately an optimistic view, and despite how much evidence he presents on how environments shape societal outcomes he also argues strongly that there are always things societies can do to overcome.
B005MW8CUG|4.0|I am now wishing I bought the vinyl as I got rid of my CD collection, except for stuff like this, but like the notes and DVD it comes with. The Pumpkins weren't that great of a live band, imho, but it still is a worthwhile watch at least once if you are a Pumpkins fan. At the very least, very happy it was included in this release. I am not a big fan of the box design concept. I think they could have made it slide out instead of close.<br /><br />Great if you are a fan of this album.
B005LAII4E|1.0|Aside from semi-cool spec effects, GI Joe had bad acting, jokes, and plot.  Anything starring the Rock is probably not going to win a good review from most.  Not worth the buy or rent.
B00755MHXG|5.0|Everyone should read this beautiful story. A great read about adversity and kindness. A great lesson to us all, a great read for teenagers as well.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Long but good! It has taken me a long time to finish and not the ending I expected.  Enjoyed the read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great adventure game for all of the family to compete with each other and you can compete with friends on Facebook!
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|this is my second rode mic, i also have the rode stereo mic pro, this one is mono, but it pipes audio into both channels, its small, light weight, and it sounds amazing.  i also own the<br />azden smx-10 stereo shotgun mic, this mic kicks its butt, so if your looking to step up, this is a good one, and it wont kill your wallet
B00633W614|4.0|I am Looking forward to the 3rd book.  I  Love how Jeffrey archer develops his story through personalizing his characters.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It taught me a lot about living,about loves and life.<br />Nicholas Sparks has a way to bring his stories to life.
B00A2V2OVK|5.0|Awesome! This brought back a lot of memories. I finally saw where Khan originated from.... the quality was perfectperfect I look forward too the next season's.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|my boyfriend loved this when it 1st came out. we never got it, but when i seen it on here for such a great price, i had to get it for him. he loves it!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is the third sonic screwdriver purchase for our family. We've liked them all, but this one tops them all. The 10 year-old recipient said it was awesome. Any Whovian would be delighted to have this sonic screwdriver. The battery cover should be removed by an adult. It is a bit tricky and easy to strip.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Been waiting for a dual Kill Bill pack forever. I have been waiting for years, and was super excited to get this for my boyfriend for christmas.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Mis&eacute;rables is one of my favorite stories and this film captures it as well as any renditions I've read or seen. The story line is accurately followed but more important the specific scene selections are very well chosen. The libretto is beautiful and the music absolutely stunning. The fact that the singing is done live is totally obvious and that makes this film version very special and unique. The long single shot of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; could wring tears out of Mr. Scrooge. The emotion is so real I felt I could reach out and touch it. Well, well done.
B001F12J0C|5.0|if you like the bourne identity. then why not get the combo with all three jason bournes. the last movie only references him.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was stunned to find myself really loving this movie. My daughters have been talking about the book and movie for a long time and when it showed up on Amazon Instant I took the time to watch it, albeit with low expectations. I was more than surprised finding myself swept up in the story and the cinematography. While the film calls for a lot of suspension of disbelief, once you get past that the movie holds together well and is well acted and filmed. I think I'll watch it again.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Everything about this shipment went excellent - love the series - the PROBLEM is that the Season 2 DVD's are bad.  Two of the three sort of play and the third one won't play at all.  Very disappointed & upset but the SELLER has sent a replacement immediately.  Fabulous Service!!!  Thank you so much and I will definately use you again!!!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|After trying out the free version, I had to purchase the full game.  It's very addictive, but.....  I would've given it five stars if the game didn't cheat (in a good way).  If you don't have any combinations, the game automatically &quot;destroys&quot; tiles for you, so the game can continue.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I enjoy this game more than expected! I would like to see more like it. It kept me engaged and involved for hours. Why Playtrix.
B000OJFV4C|3.0|I started watching this series due to my background with British history. I enjoyed the colorfulness of the production, but can't get over the historical inaccuracy put into the show. If you are building a historical docudrama then events should be as accurate as possible. This show is what leads people to believe what they see on TV, vice what is reality.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The story is phenomenally written!  I absolutely love it, they are so hard to put down.  They are actually good stories...which seems hard to find lately
B000FA675C|5.0|I'm not a big reader, but wanted to read this, I had heard so much about it and it was such a great story, very interesting stuff and I read it in less than a week, I couldn't seem to put it down and stop reading. I definitely want to read more of his books!
B00ADQOEDU|4.0|For many years I stubbornly refused to watch this series because I thought it was going to be just yet another run-of-the-mill police/detective series.  Well, I was so very wrong and I don't know why I pushed back like I did.  But at least now I can feast my obsession with this series by watching one episode after the other without having to wait a week or longer for the next episode to come out ;)<br /><br />It's gripping, gritty, and each and every actor provides outstanding performances.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a rare look at the life and attitude of the German fighter pilots, and the attitude of the common, German people, which is often lacking in WW II portrayals.  Plus, it is a wonderful story of two enemies becoming brothers.
B0037VNX44|4.0|What a stellar performance by Tom Hardy.  One of the best performances of his to date.  As for the film, a fantastic outside looking in view of a man both misunderstood as well as disturbed (not to judge him by any means).
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Not realistic relationship.  Behaved like a couple of 20 years old.  Badly written.  only some funny parts.  Not quite sure why I finished it.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Of course I miss Matt Damon, but this movie is pretty good. Typical action sequences from a &#34;Bourne&#34; movie. Nice scenes and locations. It's fun to root for Renner's character.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|So much easier to use Amazon for music.  I can preview the songs.  I don't have to go to a store and search through to find the CD I think I am looking for.  Delivery was fast.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The beginning of this movie is very good. The action sequence of the plane crash is terrific. But the rest of the movie is kinda sad and more of a tragedy than an action movie. So if you are expecting action, this movie is not for you. But if you are expecting a meaningful drama, it's a great movie. Ran a little long and there are a couple of hokey parts, so not an Oscar type movie. Worth paying to rent though.
0385349947|5.0|Women in the workplace should read this book. Men usually get ahead because of how we women think about ourselves. Women need to think of themselves as equals, not less than. Lean In, and get that position you want.
B003ZFCBJ0|3.0|Overall a meaningful and good story. Definitely a chic flick though. Worth watching free for prime members. Miley surprisingly decent actress in this movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|so awesome game omg I love this game we should make a club for people. for whom plays it on every device in the world?!!!!!!?????????!!!!!!!!???????!!!!!
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Don't know what all the Oscar hype was all about. This was a great movie but Zero Dark Thirty was a lot better. And It should have won best picture. But overall this was good and I would recommend watching it. Interesting how the US govt handled this crisis.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I haven't laughed as hard and as often at an Apatow movie since &#34;40 Year Old Virgin&#34;. And as the title suggests, probably going to be more relevant to the 30-40 crowd, but if you are 40, it's catharsis.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've seen a bunch of reviews where adults are worried this book is to young for you Buy it Read it and don't be surprised when your caught up surprised in love and crying along with a character or two I loved it and can't wait to read more books by Colleen  Hoover
B00000EN0O|2.0|): the tape must have been exposed to the sun as it is pretty much unplayable fading in and out and warbling, sad thing as this is one of my favorite albums
1607066017|5.0|This might be one of the best books out there right now, not being a bing fan of sci-fi but still cant put this one down
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I liked it. Interesting, most excellent set decoration and costumes ... but \\"Best Movie of the Year\\" - not quite. Ben Affleck, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman are phenomenal ... Definitively worth watching
B0094LYBT2|5.0|An excellent movie showing the sacrifices a parent goes through and the commitment parents have to care and raise their children.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|It doesn't say what I say but other than that it's nice to make videos but still if you want him to talk don't get it if you don't mind him talking or not that's not my choice it's up to you if you don't want him talking to you
B001J20ZIA|5.0|A great movie for kids, but adults will love watching it too.  Great story line of learning not to be a bully, and how to get along.  It is one of our favorites!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome! Get this app. There are so many cool things out there. Great ideas for everything. Plus its fun. I really enjoy this site and the app has no problems
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awsome.<br />this is the best game ever everyone should get it!<br />it is really worth buying it but I love it
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I think this app is great. Heads up to the person who created this. The camera has very high quality so that's great. One flaw is that sometimes, once in a while the camera will freeze and so would the recorder would also freeze. But other than that it's great!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game I do reccomand it to other people on my list and like how I get lives and able to give lives.
B0091REZMW|4.0|can be slow to load.  takes awhile to gain diamonds.  need to make friends to get ahead I the game.  it is the type of game were you play a little bit each day.
B0038P59A0|4.0|I'm not much for &#34;period&#34; movies, but my wife says she liked it better than the first movie.  I thought the character development was good.  The action was good.  There was a lot of detail in the movie, as one would expect from Sherlock Holmes.  For that reason I rated it better than just &#34;okay&#34;.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I didn't realize how small this was by the photos, I uploaded a pic of my hand holding it so you can get scope of the size, but eventhough it's a lot smaller than I thought it still works handily and lights up my closet satisfactorily.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Very entertaining, great sound track, fast moving, clever plot, and detailed animation.<br />Streaming video played well on my nine-inch tablet.
B000I9X53W|5.0|The story could have been comical but it isn't; it is a brilliant, edgy New York script with great locations. One of DH's finest hours.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|There's been so much hype about these books that I thought I'd give it a try even though the Kindle sample didn't offer much to draw me in and the price was steep. Yeah, I'm cheap but nowadays I can honestly say some of the best books cost me 99c so a price tag of $9.99 doesn't guarantee anything.<br /><br />I'm a 38 year old mother of two but I do enjoy YA fiction. Some of it offers some unique takes on things, like Amanda Hocking's Trylle series which I enjoyed. They were fun and age appropriate but not goody-goody.<br /><br />City of Bones just couldn't hold my interest. I finished it but felt myself rolling my eyes or struggling to continue because of my exasperation. First of all, the names...Jace sounds like a character from a trade paperback romance and has the personality of one. He's all gorgeousness and cockiness. Clary is the semi-nerdy girl that he (would never in real life) takes a shine to. But he hides it. And so does she. But it's inevitable in a way that just lacks any fun. They argue. They argue more. The whole story takes a backseat to their drama.<br /><br />I won't go into most of the other characters because they're such stock characters, there's no point. Oh,wait, Jace's best friend is in love with him and everybody but Jace gets it.<br />h<br />The one interesting character is Hodge and that's mostly because--SPOILER ALERT--he seems so nice and caring and wise but betrays these young people who are supposedly depending on him.<br /><br />The premise of this book was so promising...people gifted with the power of angels to fight the dark creatures of this world. If only the characterization had been as imaginative and well thought out as the idea behind the book. Definitely not the book I was hoping for.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I found myself fascinated by this disability, and the way it was treated by the various other characters.  I read the book before seeing the movie, and was amazed by the difference.  I definitely preferred the book, it seemed more possibly real, and I was glad I had read it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app for any horse loving kid or kid at heart especially considering it was a free app. i would recommend if this fits someone in your life.
B003WC5EQI|5.0|I have watched this over and over  many times. What a great story. The music is wonderful as well. I once started reading the book and I just could not get through it. But, now after watching this so many times I don't need to read it at all. I can tell you the story. Tess was a very strong woman  and I was so sad to see  the way it all ended for her.  Life certainly can be hard for  so many people. It certainly was for her. She deserved so much more. You really need to watch this.It's wonderful!!!!!
B0088W6LGY|5.0|This show is possibly one of the best shows that was on tv and the only thing I did not like is that they ended the show at only 5 seasons.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|There was so much drinking and denial that the ending was kind of feeble and misdirected. In a way, it seemed kind of selfish.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Good, not like the movie at all. Liked the movie better than this book. I can't write any more words. So
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Any ordinary Joe truly in love can relate to the Russel Crowe character.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Just when you thought you had it all figured out they throw in the ultimate twist, I would recommend it.
0316228532|5.0|I find it virtually impossible to imagine anyone younger than college-aged able to get anything worthwhile from this book. At that, I think being at least in one's 30s is going to enable a reader of The Casual Vacancy to have the perspective to really understand what's going on with these characters. I don't believe the young will understand the characters' motivations and how they are interacting within their environments and relationships and influencing each other.<br /><br />I think the points Rowling is trying to get across with regard to social class, being the product of one's environment, and how life outcomes can be altered by the quality of interactions and resources available to an individual will be either opaque to young readers or completely boring.<br /><br />This book has a lot to say about not judging those whose shoes you haven't walked in, and explains a lot about lower-functioning individuals-- whether disadvantaged, or those middle class characters who are just ignorant or emotional cripples. I fear younger readers will find this book disturbing and not \\"get\\" it. That would be a shame as this is a compelling book with real issues portrayed. They should wait until older, when they can glean something from it.<br /><br />Some are saying that JK Rowling must \\"hate mankind\\" to have written about some ugly characters and unpleasant situations. I completely disagree. In this work, she shows the complexities within our characters and how people are neither good nor evil. I am a therapist and I am always overjoyed to discover authors and works that actually ring true. Great book.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Just because I like something I don't want to have write some stupid raving review.  I gave it 5 stars that should be enough.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|One reviewer noted that Dido does not drastically change or experiment much with her sound, but that each of her albums is a measured change in subtle increments. She tinkers and toys with her sound like renovating a room in a house. Each of her albums is slightly different from one another. So, \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" is not much of a musical, or even lyrical, departure for Dido, but what she does do within her house of music, she does well. While 2008's \\"Safe Trip Home\\" was a study in somberness with sparse musical arrangements driven by the loss of her father, \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" is more uptempo, electronic, and perhaps lyrically back to 2008's \\"Life For Rent\\".<br /><br />The 11 tracks go down easily, but like all of her albums, \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" just misses being a classic album. \\"No Freedom\\", \\"Girl Who Got Away\\", \\"Let Us Move On\\", \\"Blackbird\\", \\"End Of Night\\" and \\"Sitting On The Roof Of The World\\" pack a solid first side punch. Things get a little uneven (as they often do for all Dido albums) toward the back half. I could argue that \\"Love To Blame\\", \\"Go Dreaming\\" and \\"Loveless Hearts\\" are the three weakest tracks here--and they are not poor songs, just potential album filler. \\"Happy New Year\\" and a possible 9/11 nod, \\"Day Before We Went To War\\" are the most interesting tracks on the back half.<br /><br />There are six bonus tracks on the deluxe version. The alternate version of \\"Let Us Move On\\" is not as good, in my opinion, as the original album version. \\"All I See\\" is decent. The best bonus tracks are \\"Just Say Yes\\" and \\"Let's Runaway\\". The Armin Van Buuren remix of the \\"Sex & The City 2\\" soundtrack song \\"Everything To Lose\\" is passable, and finally, \\"Lost\\" is just okay.<br /><br />As I listened to \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" multiple times this week, I felt it was a good, solid, sturdy album from Dido. I like it as much as \\"Life For Rent\\". Each album from Dido is pretty good, and I like her as an artist--she is still unique in her own way when held up against such contemporaries as Enya, Sarah McLachlan, Loreena McKennitt, Paula Cole, Annie Lennox, Goldfrapp, Enigma, Mike Oldfield, Sarah Brightman, Jane Siberry, Joni Mitchell, Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Regina Spektor, Feist, Alanis Morissette, Jewel, Imogen Heap, etc. Dido has her own vocal style with her own musical style courtesy of contributions by her brother, Rollo (of Faithless).<br /><br />So, four stars for \\"Girl Who Got Away\\". I suspect it will end up on my end of year best list. Here's how it compares to Dido's other albums:<br /><br />1999 No Angel: Three Stars<br />2003 Life For Rent: Four Stars<br />2008 Safe Trip Home: Three and a Half Stars<br />2013 Girl Who Got Away: Four Starsemporaries as Enya, Sarah McLachlan, Loreena McKennitt, Paula Cole, Annie Lennox, Goldfrapp, Enigma, Mike Oldfield, Sarah Brightman, Jane Siberry, Joni Mitchell, Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Regina Spektor, Feist, Alanis Morissette, Jewel, Imogen Heap, etc. Dido has her own vocal style with her own musical style courtesy of contributions by her brother, Rollo (of Faithless).<br /><br />So, four stars for \\"Girl Who Got Away\\".

B009YP9L7U|1.0|Do not read. This book contains very graphic sexual scenes.  I do not recommend it.  It is offensive and inappropriate.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|this game is a waste of money and it has terrible graphics. don't buy this game but you can if u want2 waste money.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Very well written. Fast moving and fun to read. I look forward to reading the other books in this series.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This game is really neat...a lot like &quot;my kingdom for the princess&quot; games...works great on my fire 8.9 HD!  It has a good amount of levels as well!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The development and interaction amongst the characters is key for a series in the long run. Dead clearly has it down to a science.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|this book was number 3 in the series and the best....so many twist and turns....got me excited to read number 4 book...I love this whole series..The author is the best...love how he describes each chapter with one of the characters...I have so much admiration for his book series
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I found this movie hard to follow.  I stuck it out and after watching it, I felt I lost about two of my life that I will never get back.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Loved this whole series...I am reading Book 4 now...I can't stop reading the story...the best reading I have had.  This author knows how to keep his readers interested in the story
B000HZGNDG|5.0|I had forgotten about this movie, but after I started watching it, I remembered it.  Too me this is better than any of the other new Star Trek movies since.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent book. A bit different from 50 shades of Grey. It really entertains and i love how it goes through. Addictive!
B000J159N8|5.0|I had never heard of this movie which surprised me.  The move was exciting and kept my attention the entire time.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|In this game you own a game developing company were you get to hire staff and make games. The good thing is when you play it the better it gets because later in the game you get to develop your own console and trust me you'll love it, but I wish it was not you hard to get a hardware engineer but don't worry you can get one just change some ones jobs around. Plus I played most of there games already there all fantastic, but I wish they did not cost so much there so addictive games and I cant wait from the next one!
1589946006|4.0|It is a good deal for the money.  I have given a lot of the small ones away as gifts & they have been well received.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Was a great read! Hot love scenes.  Characters were great.  I love to see a good girl save a bad boy unintentionally.  When a bad boy falls he falls hard.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|Lots of laughs!  Actors were excellent and special effects were top notch.  One scene was a little gruesome, i.e., when Rick Moranis (sp?) chopped up the dentist behind a curtain.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Volbeat has recently become one of my favorite bands. The mix of rock'n'roll and heavy metal from these Danes brought some freshness into the metal scene and playing a very straightforward sound, they created awesome songs with killer riffs, smart vocal lines, catchy choruses and lots of moments for headbanging.<br /><br />So I waited anxiously for OG&SL. At first audition, my impression was they had become more commercial, as there are several easier listening songs. In fact, OG&SL has minimal middle ground than before, there is a set of very heavy Metallicaish songs and other who are catchy rock songs.<br /><br />However, I took the time to listen to it a few times and it grew on me quite fast, to the point where I cannot stop listening to it. And this comes from the fact that Mr Michael Poulsen is a great composer, that even downright radio friendly songs can be outstanding, placed beside a trash metal song and it makes sense. His vocal lines are increasingly better and Also, drums seem to me to be more apparent than before, adding to the groove in many songs. And Rob Caggiano's addition as axeman added quality to the band (although I wished Hank Sherman from Mercyful Fate had become a permanent member).<br /><br />OG&SL starts growing with the more commercial and melodic Pearl Heart that has a great melodic vocal line. It becomes somewhat heavier with The Nameless One, that alternates groovier guitars/drums with a melodic vocal lines in the chorus, with a kinda-country sad solo / vocal bridge. And then...<br /><br />Dead But Rising is an instant classic and my fave song here. This is pure Metallica at their best, heavy as hell, you really cab listen to James Hetfield singing this one. This is followed by Cape Of Our Hero, a downright commercial song but whose video and lyrics struck a chord with me (those who have kids will probably feel it too), and also one excellent example of Mr. Poulsen's ability, just like Fallen. And then...<br /><br />Mr. King Diamond join forces into Room 24, another heavy as hell song and one of my faves as well. It's perfect for King's voice and his altercations with Poulsen are somewhat amazing (too bad it will be hard to do it live...). The Hangman's Body Count starts melancholic, developing into another very heavy song a la Volbeat, but with slower paced vocal-led choruses, that just adds heaviness to the song. My Body is a cover of poppy punk band Young The Giant, and shifts the heaviness from the previous songs into one of those more upbeat songs Volbeat is good at. Lola Montez is also more upbeat, heavy rock'n'roll, but again, the vocal leads are killer.<br /><br />Then, comes Black Bart. To me it sounds like a mix of punk, country and trash metal, it has a rhythm that is contagious. The Lonesome Rider is another example of how Mr. Poulsen is a distinguished composer. It's very Johhny Cash and June Carter, with Poulsen and Canadian singer Sarah Blackwood on a duet. Her voice is amazing and the vocal lines are from the other world. It's not metal, but it's as good as if it were. Just plain proof of this band's ability to do great songs regardless of style.<br /><br />The Sinner Is You is also a non-metal song that is great. Upbeat rocker with killer and catchy vocal lines, drums focused on plates and changes from laidback riffs to melodic guitar lines between the vocals, and one great guitar solo.<br /><br />The the mix of western and Metallica comes again in Doc Holliday, to change the mood of the album once again. The beginning brings you to the old cowboy movies as well as the Oh-oh-oh slower paced chorus, but the rest of the song could have easily had James Hetfield singing and riffing. And the album ends with my least favorite song, Our Loved Ones, a kind of heavy ballad that is good, but not really special. If you get the special 2-CD edition, the first song in the second disk (Ecotone) is a pure Metallica from And Justice For All...), a great song that could have been easily insertedinto the main album.<br /><br />I cannot say at this stage whether OG&SL is better than Heaven Nor Hell, but is certainly an album that proves why Volbeat is the NEXT metal band. At the same time it's typical Volbeat and different from the previous albums. The heavier songs are amazing and up to anything they released (execpt for Evelyn...), the rocky upbeat songs are also great and do not sound as sell-off at any time. Now let's hope for the next one...
B008602KQI|5.0|great plot line. this is my second time watching it. I saw it in theaters first when it came out.
B0078XFYDA|4.0|the arguments are basic and effective, but i really enjoy Dawkins' other books for the more sophisticated discussions- more convincing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show and how very &#34;human&#34; it is!<br />I especially  love being able to watch it with my Roku hooked up to our TV and stream it from Amazon, I don't have to watch commercials that way!<br />I just got into the show in the past couple of months and have watched all 3 seasons, it's going to be hard to wait for the new season to start, but I'll buy it again!!
B007CBEO20|5.0|Europe continues to deliver quality music. I just wish American radio would get off the boring ass playlists and give music like this a chance. Killer guitars and vocals.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book really makes you think of your own career, work relationships, and how we can support each other at work. It is definitely worth reading multiple times: it also has great ideas and strategies for being more successful and supportive of others at work.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Love the show and remember some of those awkward years. Feel good show about getting back to the top and not letting the bullies win.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I like the twists of the story. The imperfections of the characters. The past and today weaving in and out. Great to be challenged by New words!! Vocabulary that stretches past the simplistic thought of most books today. Good gems within.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is fun! Very Fun to play! I would recommend this game to everyone who has free time! Plus you can't beat that its free!
0156034026|2.0|The begining gave some sort of a fast pace suspense as what's going to happen next. But the ending is a bit dissapointing!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great series about an era that so much corruption, politics, religion, and power. Looking forward to season 2 and continue on with series
0385535139|4.0|Fast paced, suspense. Towards the end the book was great, it is just the first few pages that you need some patience
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|My feelings about the new Paramore album:<br />During my first listen I was expecting to hear the SAME Paramore from \\"All We Know\\", \\"Riot\\", & \\"Brand New Eyes\\" & all Paramore purists out there will probably do the same. But it's not the same Paramore from those previous masterpieces & I should've known that being that the Farros who began this group are no longer a part of the band. All that being said & after giving it another listen without those expectations I still really like this new album. It offers A LOT of different sounds, but even though its different if you listen closely enough there is still some of that classic Paramore swag there. I would not say that they remain Paramore, its clear that they are something else, but I'm willing to give this new band a try & look forward to what their future holds.<br /><br />Favorites include (in order of tracklisting):<br />1. Fast In My Car<br />2. Now<br />6. Ain't it Fun (in my opinion this has a really different song especially with the choir at the end but its such a fun and happy song)<br />7. Part II<br />9. Still into You (give it a chance. Its the most \\"pop\\" of the songs in my opinion and it really serves its purpose of being a happy love song about her bf from New Found Glory)<br />10. Anklebiters<br />12. Proof<br />13. Hate to See Your Heart Break (this song is on the line of \\"The Only Exception\\", not as good sounding but lyrically is a good love song)<br />14. One of those Crazy Girls (retro-sounding song)<br />17. Future (What I love about this song is that it starts off so simplistic but by the end evolves into this HARD guitar focused outro as if meshing together the \\"new Paramore\\" with the past as they set their sights on their evolution)<br /><br />But these are just my thoughts, if you are expecting the old Paramore you wont blatantly find that here. If you are willing to find out what this new Paramore is all about & aren't going to shun the album on the first round I think you'd be pleasantly surprised by what you find here...
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome i really like it.but the unrest points are to hard to get. You need to use so many to buy things
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I have read several of the reviews and wonder what film these people saw. This film was bad, just awful.<br /><br />In \\"The Master\\" I cannot find one appealing character, one moment of joy or even one moment of empathy for any of these characters. Nor can I find anything interesting about the plot (was there any?) or about the script. The only concession I will give is Mr. Phoenix's performance in filing out the role of a truly revolting, screwball character.<br /><br />If the director's point was to make the audience loathe these characters and loathe the idea of the modern day religious cult, then he succeeded beyond measure. I wanted to walk out half way through this awful, this truly bloody film experience, but I suffered through it til the vulgar end. The last scene of Freddie and the girl in bed having sex was gross. I would much prefer to watch porn, if this is what art house film has become. At least with a good porn film, there are attractive bodies to view and laugh-out loud dialogue and ridiculous plot twists that can at least provide a modicum of entertainment value. As far as the artistic value of \\"The Master\\" it belongs in a TOILET.
B0067R0APK|4.0|I mostly like the new version because it looks more slick.  My one issue is that the weather icons are all monochrome.  I know this is a small thing but I find I really miss the color cues - yellow for sun, blue for rain,  etc
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I love this movie! it is definitely a masterpiece and every bit of it left me wanting more. The actors/actresses did an excellent job at drawing the audience into their lives. I am still confused why this movie wasn't selected as best movie of the year. I give it 5 stars and could have given it more. I could watch it over and over.
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|When I first listened to this album I was thinking, \\"the singles were the better songs\\" and I was disappointed. Hayley's voice almost sounds different to me and the lyrics are nothing compared to past albums. However, I love the music! I love the change. I do wish there was more complicated drum beats, but otherwise the music is great. I hope they find a great drummer soon...
B008220C56|5.0|What can you say Keira Knightley and Joe Wright make great movies! Wonderful Cast - Beautiful Movie!<br />Set in late-19th-century Russia high-society, the aristocrat Anna Karenina enters into a life-changing affair with the affluent Count Vronsky.<br />Aaron Taylor-Johnson is wonderful as Vronsky,Alicia Vikander as the beautiful Kitty and Keira perfect as her she portrays the emotional beautiful Anna. And of course Jude Law and Matthew Macfadyen.<br />It was lovely and almost artistic to watch in the theater but if you missed it buy it or stream it now! You wont be disappointed

B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Very powerful movie.  Even though the subject matter is a bit off-putting at first, it slowly draws you in and becomes a movie you'll never forget.

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The Trilogy is phantactic, but book 3 was not as captivating as the other two. A lot of it was reflection on the previous events.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|PC Specs, most current ((Scroll down and disregard if you're computer-illiterate)) :<br />MoBo- M2N68-LA (Narra5)<br />CPU- AMD Athlon II X4 640<br />GPU- RaedonHD 6670<br />PSU- SeaSonic S12II 430w<br />RAM- 2GB total, stock.<br /><br />I did a mass amount of researching when choosing which parts to upgrade my computer with. This CPU, solely when describing the requirements for the CQ5600Y (M2N68-LA (Narra5) motherboard), is one of the very few affordable, but powerful options currently available. Although this is, by far, not the newest technology to date, it is a MAJOR and highly recommended buy when compared to the stock processor.<br /><br />I'm currently running Minecraft on all high setting graphics with normal render distance set. In game, I average about 50 FPS in a non-populated, but bustling sever. My temperatures for all four of my processor cores average about 52 C throughout game-play (I do have a liquid cooling unit installed, about $40 from Corsair, versus the stock fan that comes with the Athlon II X4 640).

B0051E9INK|3.0|For starters, the story is very cheesy to begin with and made more out of in the shows of the same name than this movie. Christopher Lambert's accent (if you want to call it that) is just atrocious..when he's speaking in his &#34;native&#34; Scottish accent, it's fine, but whatever he adopts in the &#34;present day&#34; is just annoying to listen to..<br /><br />Sean Connery does little to save this silly movie..
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was consistently difficult to stop reading mid chapter.  I stayed up later than desired several nights because I would have to at least get to the end of a chapter.  I found this book gripping and I can't stop thinking about it.  I wish I would have read it with someone else so that we could talk about it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great twist and turns a few shocks along the way...  Stay'd up way to late trying to reading the whole thing in one sitting....<br /><br />Nice to read other reviews about this book and they were right.

0061191981|5.0|I've seen Chef Ramsay on TV on occasion. Enough to get my curiosity up, read about him on Wikipedia, and read this book. Now that I have, my respect for him has increased immensely. The yelling isn't just bullying. He wants to do well and he wants those he is associated with to do well.<br /><br />As he says in the book, the tough childhood and family situation he describes explains some of it. I feel truly heartbroken to read of his struggles with his brother's substance abuse problems. The topsy-turvy path he took to becoming a top chef leaves me dizzy.<br /><br />I didn't want to put this book down until I was done reading. A top review is titled, perhaps jokingly, \\"Gordon needs a hug.\\" I think he does, and I'd love to give him one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for the new season!  Unfortunately I haven't seen the first two seasons but I'm hooked anyway am looking forward to more.
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|There are some subtitled parts in this movie, but these sections are brief and not a lot to read, so there shouldn't be too much groaning from those people who hate to have to read subtitles - hopefully knowing this going in will help you not mind so much.<br /><br />I watched this on my pc via Amazon instant video (not in blu-ray, 3D or even HD) - and I have to say the cinematography is really beautiful!  It is an interesting story - how could someone have thought this up, could this have really happened or is it all someone's imagination?  (It seems it was imagination.)<br /><br />The movie IS interesting, but as you might guess it would HAVE to be from the type of story it is, it sometimes feels long.  It does make you THINK now and then and so it stays with you, in your thoughts for a good time after the movie has ended.<br /><br />The different actors used to portray \\"PI\\" in various stages/ages of his life do not seem to look enough like each other to escape notice - but it's ok.  It doesn't seem to hurt the movie at all, just pointing out that we noticed so you probably will too.<br /><br />When PI is finally rescued, he is questioned about the loss of the ship (insurance, you know) - and they don't like his story (which you just watched, with the tiger and all) and so they ask him to come up with a more believable story.  When he relates the more believable version, he gets emotional and so you are left to wonder which is really true - and he asks which you prefer to be true.  Then the person PI is telling all this to notes correlation of the characters in each version, and I had to then replay the 2nd \\"believable\\" version for the insurance people to see that comparison for myself, so I was really glad I saw this on video and not live at the movies where I wouldn't have been able to do that.  ... it is an interesting little twist to the tale I think.<br /><br />It's a very CLEAN movie so good for the family (though kids have to deal with the subject of how vicious animals can be - which is a good lesson, but you want to be aware of that before a very young child sees this, so you're prepared), and PI is just a likable character - which is a MUST for a successful movie).<br /><br />I don't know if this is a movie I'd want to watch over and over - but it was one I did enjoy watching, and so I would recommend it to most viewers. (Some great special effects for the storms too!)cious animals can be - which is a good lesson, but you want to be aware of that before a very young child sees this, so you're prepared), and PI is just a likable character - which is a MUST for a successful movie).<br /><br />I don't know if this is a movie I'd want to watch over and over - but it was one I did enjoy watching, and so I would recommend it to most viewers.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|Wasn't sure that this book would draw me in as it starts out a standard \\"kill em\\" bad guy,good guy story. But the addition of teen girl added to the eventual twists that created a more compelling story. I do like a book without slot of superfluous background and conversation sometimes. This book fit that Bill.

B00ARA4SLU|3.0|With the success of the EVIL DEAD remake I wonder if young movie goers will understand the shock and outrage that came about with the initial release of Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO. In 1960 this film stunned audiences around the world with what was then extreme footage. Compared to today's films it was nothing but that's the thing about classic films. To watch them and to get out of them what the film maker intended you have to place yourself back at that time rather than view it from today's standards.<br /><br />But apparently there was plenty going on behind the scenes with the creation of PSYCHO as well and that is the story behind the new DVD release HITCHCOCK. Not only that the film is also a love story of a great director and the woman that helped him reach the pinnacle of his career. The two themes work side by side to tell an interesting story that holds your interest from start to finish.<br /><br />The film opens with Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) looking for a new project having just finished with the release of NORTH BY NORTHWEST to rather tame reviews. His wife Alma (Helen Mirren) is trying to get him to work with an old friend, Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), who has a new book in the making. But Hitchcock is searching for something no one expects, no one has seen. Eventually he comes across something other studios are bypassing, a popular book called PSYCHO.<br /><br />Based on the true life story of Ed Gein, a small town man who seemed rather easygoing but who was cannibalizing corpses and using body parts to decorate his home, Hitchcock sees something unique here. The problem is no studio will back the picture with the funds necessary to make it. Discussing this at home Hitchcock and Alma decide to make the picture using their own funds. If the film is a success they can thumb their noses at the studio heads. If it fails, they lose all.<br /><br />The production story told here revolves around Hitchcock's obsession with the blonde haired beauties that always took center stage in his films. While he never touched, he often found himself entranced by their beauty to the extent that he often times ignored the one woman who supported him from the start of his career to its end.<br /><br />On the love story side we are witness to Alma's seemingly friendly interest in Whitfield. Working together in his secret beach house their efforts are truly platonic. Problems arise when Hitchcock finds Alma spending more time working there than on his project. His suspicions increase the more she's away to the point he actually becomes jealous, much the same feelings Alma has as he ogles the blondes in his films. Beneath the anger both have about their particular situations there is a deep love that lasted until their deaths.<br /><br />The film is an interesting look behind the scenes of what became the biggest hit that Hitchcock had in his long career, a success he never exceeded. The main thing that makes it work is the performances by both lead actors here. Mirren offers a woman who loves her husband deeply yet feels ignored both by him and those who don't realize just how much she contributed to his success and she does it in both subtle and non-subtle ways. Hopkins turns in another outstanding performance as well. Where he could have simply done a caricature of Hitchcock he instead gives us the nuances that the man was known for but also displays the complexity and insecurity behind the genius that was there.<br /><br />The movie was released but sparingly so to theaters and has received little push on the DVD market as well. That's sad because my guess is there are few young people today who know exactly who Hitchcock was and the amazing films he made. Ask and if you're lucky they may know PSYCHO but not the other films he is known for. This movie would make a great starting point to get them interested in the man and his films. It's entertaining and informative and leaves you wanting more.lways took center stage in his films.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely speechless.  There are not words to describe this book but WOW!! How wonderful that every little thing comes together in the end.  Just when you think everything had come out and other mind blowing thing come about.  WOW WOW!! Loved this book more than any I have ever read in my entire LIFE!!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|For those of us alive when the hostage crisis took place in the seventies we've not forgotten what tensions in the Middle East were like at that time. We had a president who showed a weak America and that was played upon by terrorists who had captured and held captive American hostages for 444 days in 1979 through 1981. Most born since those dates have little or no idea that it happened. It's become a forgotten page in history. Not so any longer.<br /><br />ARGO tells the story not of those particular hostages but of 6 Americans who escaped from the Embassy before it was taken. Hidden in the home of the Canadian ambassador, a team of CIA operatives worked on plans to help them escape. With streets to overflowing with hostile protestors and terrorists the straight and easy methods were out. There was little that could be done and no plan seemed fool proof. But one might do the trick.<br /><br />Ben Affleck (who also directed) stars as Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who has planned escapes before. A chance look at a trade magazine and a plot forms in his head: pretend that a Hollywood production company is making a science fiction movie and take the 6 people out as members of the crew scouting locations. All it takes is finding a way to make it appear they came into the country so they can be taken out. With nothing but bad ideas on how to rescue these 6 people, this becomes the best worst idea.<br /><br />Mendez sets about by recruiting a friend in John Chambers (John Goodman), the special effects man responsible for the make up in PLANET OF THE APES. He in turn helps Mendez connect with Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), a producer of note in the past who agrees to help them set up a fake production company and to find the right script. Everything has to appear on the up and up to convince the Iranian government. A script is found, an office opened, ads posted in the trade magazines and a party with a reading of the movie is even held all to make it seem legit.<br /><br />Backgrounds for each of the \\"crew\\" members are formed and set up for Mendez to provide each of the 6 still in Iran. They will have to know their cover stories to the letter if the plan is to work. Once Mendez gets the okay and lands in country, this becomes a point of contention among the 6. While their options are non-existent, a few have a problem coming to terms with this plan. Mendez assures them he will get them out.<br /><br />The majority of the film involves the set up of the escape of the 6. The planning, the bureaucracy and the involvement of so many people with so many possibilities of the plan failing are covered. What is amazing is that these details are spun here in such a way as to never be boring or seem like the film lasts too long, unlike ZERO DARK THIRTY. Instead, Affleck has the pacing of the film done to perfection.<br /><br />The last portion of the film involves the group as they finally leave the ambassador's home and head for the airport. Affleck again does a magnificent job as the tension mounts from minute to minute. Whether you know the results of this mission or not you soon find your palms sweating and heart racing as you wait to see if they escape or not.<br /><br />ARGO was nominated for and won the Best Picture Oscar this past year. For once I have to agree with a win in that category. This is truly a movie worth watching more than once. The only sad note is that Affleck was overlooked when it came to direction. That award went to Ang Lee for LIFE OF PI. While I enjoyed that movie as well, I think perhaps Affleck should have edged out Lee. Perhaps one day Hollywood will recognize his talents behind the camera as well as in front.ounds for each of the \\"crew\\" members are formed and set up for Mendez to provide each of the 6 still in Iran.

What is amazing is that these details are spun here in such a way as to never be boring or seem like the film lasts too long, unlike ZERO DARK THIRTY. Instead, Affleck has the pacing of the film done to perfection.<br /><br />The last portion of the film involves the group as they finally leave the ambassador's home and head for the airport. Affleck again does a magnificent job as the tension mounts from minute to minute. Whether you know the results of this mission or not you soon find your palms sweating and heart racing as you wait to see if they escape or not.<br /><br />ARGO was nominated for and won the Best Picture Oscar this past year. For once I have to agree with a win in that category. This is truly a movie worth watching more than once. The only sad note is that Affleck was overlooked when it came to direction. That award went to Ang Lee for LIFE OF PI. While I enjoyed that movie as well, I think perhaps Affleck should have edged out Lee. Perhaps one day Hollywood will recognize his talents behind the camera as well as in front.
B002WJI63A|4.0|I was surprised how small this doll is to be honest maybe because I got used to see my son's 18\\" Mario soft toy, it also looks smaller than the 8\\" Yoshi and Toad, I guess because Peach herself is slim :) But anyway, my 3 yo daughter liked it.<br />The doll is so soft and looks like peach, not exactly but as adv.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|It's hard to believe that there is a young generation out there that didn't experience 9/11 first hand. For those of us who lived through it, it doesn't seem all that long ago. So this generation can't quite grasp the importance of Osama Bin Laden's death. Still, two movies came out last year with that subject at their core. One seemed little more than a promotional piece for President Obama during an election year (going so far as to include an ill timed comment by Mitt Romney who had nothing to do with the subject matter) showing almost as much of him as the SEAL team that took Bin Laden out. The other was nominated for best picture and nearly won.<br /><br />ZERO DARK THIRTY was noted for taking a few dramatic liberties (such as the main character actually being a composite of several main players in what unfolded) but that doesn't detract from the story being told. Jessica Chastain stars as Maya, a young CIA agent on her first time in the Middle East as the film opens. She's there during an interrogation and sees first hand how brutal it can be. While she shies away from it she stays silent.<br /><br />The film moves quickly from place to place, time to time through the career of Maya. She doggedly pursues any lead that could find Bin Laden. One possible lead is a courier for messages he sends out but that falls to the wayside when he apparently is killed. It's not until later in the film that she learns he came from a family with 8 brothers and it was one of them killed not the man she was searching for.<br /><br />Through her career we see how things change. Her passive nature turns to a desire to catch and kill her prey. When a friend is killed in a car bombing Maya becomes even more determined. Add to that a machine gun attack on her and she won't let anyone stand in her way, not even her immediate supervisors. Maya's in your face attitude may not win her a large number of friends but it does earn her respect.<br /><br />No, this isn't a spoiler since we know the outcome of this story. Eventually a possible site for Bin Laden is found. When a table full of bureaucrats is asked if this is a 100% surety that Bin Laden is there they each take a turn hem hawing around with smaller percentages in mind. Only Maya has the courage to say this is as close to 100$ as they are likely to ever be.<br /><br />Given the go ahead the last 30 minutes or so of the film deals with the SEAL team that was sent in to capture or kill Bin Laden. While the film to this point, nearly 2 hours, dealt with what it took to find him, this 30 minutes is shown from a tactical standpoint where we see the team organize then put into action the plan to take him out in action.<br /><br />The thing that stands out about this film is that it seems more matter of fact than most movies made. There is no John Wayne type motivating and leading a group into the battle field. This is more what the situation was like, plain and simple. The only bad thing about that is that it plays out kind of bland.<br /><br />Perhaps we're all still too close to the situation than we'd like to admit. Perhaps the wounds are still too exposed. Perhaps the death of Bin Laden was too quick and sudden to accept. While the story is an important one and this film does give credit where credit was due, it's still a bit slow paced and realistic to be considered entertainment. A good movie technically yes, but for enjoyment I'm not so sure. Whether you watch this film will be determined by your outlook on the situation.

B00005CDNK|5.0|I have the LP of this album when it came out.  I now love having the cd!!!  It's a wonderful memory of such GREAT music!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I'm always pleased when I come across something that surprises me and makes me smile out of the blue. The only sad part about the movie I'm writing about this week is that it's a French film. Why is that sad? Because there are far too many people in this world who won't take the chance, won't take the time and won't pay attention to what they're watching enough to see this film. Once they learn they'll have to read subtitles they'll pass it by. The sad thing is in doing so they'll miss one of the best movies of this past year. So take a chance, please.<br /><br />THE INTOUCHABLES is the story of Driss (Omar Sy), a young black man recently released from jail and living in the low income housing area of Paris. The story opens with Driss seemingly applying for a job taking care of a wealthy quadriplegic man named Phillipe (Francois Cluzet). Phillipe is bored with each applicant and known for being a task master. When Driss comes in just asking them to sign his welfare papers so he can collect, Phillipe tells him to come back the next day.<br /><br />Driss returns home to have his mother ask him to leave because of his past. With several brothers and sisters, he does so in the hopes of helping them. The next morning he returns to Phillipe's home and is told he's being hired temporarily to see if he works out. Most of the staff doesn't think he'll make it. But Phillipe see's something in him that the rest don't. More than that he knows Driss will offer him more honesty and straight forwardness than the rest of the staff.<br /><br />Driss is amazed at his living conditions first. It's the first time he's had a room of his own let alone a custom bathroom for his own use. As Driss goes about his first day, he does indeed offer no ounce of sympathy for Phillipe and talks to him like any other person he would me. Phillipe finds this incredibly refreshing and actually finds something to smile about in the presence of Driss. Driss begins to learn Phillipe's daily routine and how things work around the house.<br /><br />As the days go by the pair become not only employer and employee but friends as well. Both try to educate the other about the differences that they have. Where Phillipe attempts to expose Driss to opera and classical music, Driss tunes Phillipe into groups like Earth Wind & Fire. They come from different worlds but they find enjoyment in each other's company.<br /><br />One of the tasks that Phillipe does each week is to write a letter to a lady pen pal he's been wooing for the past 6 months. Filled with expressions of romance Driss can't believe he's not tried to meet her and sets about doing so by calling her and then passing the phone to Phillipe. A meeting is scheduled but no one knows for sure what will happen.<br /><br />The same is true of Driss' past catching up to him. Concerned about his family and the chance that his brother may turn up like him he keeps an eye on them from the sidelines and eventually must make a decision just who needs help more, his brother or Phillipe.<br /><br />Through it all the Driss and Phillipe share small adventures that show both have a sense of wonder still and a love of life. Though confined to his wheelchair and unable to move anything but his head and neck, Phillipe learns to smile and laugh again.<br /><br />There is a certain joy about this film that rubs off after viewing it. You'll find yourself literally laughing out loud at moments. I know I did. Best of all will be the life affirming knowledge that the film was based on a true story. What became of the pair is revealed just before the credits.<br /><br />Acting is something that transcends language. The facial expressions and moves of an actor in film show that it is a visual art form rather than just the sounds made vocally. Yes, the things they say in this film will make you laugh but coupled with the actions both actors offer great performances here.<br /><br />Nominated around the world for awards it's sad that it wasn't nominated for best foreign picture at this year's Academy Awards. It should have won hands down. So don't be afraid to try something different. Don't let the fact that this film is French scare you away. Take a moment and enjoy the story and laugh at all it has to offer. Easily one of the best films I've seen this past year.t nominated for best foreign picture at this year's Academy Awards.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This sounds too good to be true.  I am going to find out.  I have a brilliant friend who knew nothing about this book.  He brought me about 20 pages of scientific research supporting  fasting.  I'm excited to try the 5:2 diet.  I have several of the health concerns mentioned. I have now brought 4 more books to give my family and friends who have some of the health  problems Dr Mosley addressed in the book.  I will recommend this book to many people.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all the hype, I thought I should read this book.  What a waste of time.  It reads like something written by a 14-year-old that has read a few issues of Cosmopolitan.  What a bore!  50 shades of snooze.  The characters are all unappealing.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it didn't improve.
B00B4VXQC8|2.0|Being a long time BJ fan, I had thought the music just got better over time (especially Bounce and Crush). Lost Highway was myahhh... Even the Circle grew on me.<br /><br />This is a mellow \\"groove\\" album like the Circle but w/out any hooks. Nothing that sticks with you. Over all the song writing is good if not preachy at most times, the studio quality is great, but the rest seems really rushed. No good bass riffs, Richie plays amazing but nothing that really stands out.<br /><br />Most of it seems like a Disney soundtrack from a decade ago.<br /><br />Not saying it's horrid by any means but ranking it to other BJ releases only deserves 2 stars IMO.<br /><br />Richie's \\"After the Math\\" is about 10x better than this. At least it has some sort of originality and passion to it. It rocks ;-)<br /><br />This one sounds like Jon is letting too much success get to his head? Sorry - Just losing touch with what reality is, and too many saying he's right without anyone challenging anything in his \\"circle\\".<br /><br />Besides Jon's good lyrics, and passion in his voice this album just doesn't sound like a Bon Jovi record. Almost as if the rest of the band came in and threw this together. It can sound good because Richie, David, Alec and Hugh are simply amazing musicians like Jon, but unlike all their previous releases, it seems to have a singular focus w/out much band behind it. They showed up, did their job, did a good job, but I'm sorry I don't feel the passion beyond that from them that has made the band so great. It's just kind of flat.<br /><br />It seems like BJ is in an identity confusion mode. For example, I love Hugh's bass playing (the unofficial band member for the last 20 years?) like in \\"Beautiful World\\" but it is nothing like what he was doing as he replaced during Keep the Faith.<br />This is a Bon Jovi release. Not a Jon Bon Jovi release. But just is...? You won't find anything on this record that really defines the band. That really allows the different members to shine at any moment. Just look at the apex guitar solos... there isn't one. The entire album is rhythm. Base, drums, guitar, everything. Even the way it is recorded. Purely voice.<br /><br />Sorry that's not a band.<br /><br />Makes me feel sad. \\"The Radio Saved My Life Tonight\\" sums my life up pretty good on so many levels.<br />I just hope BJ can find an identity again that doesn't revolve around just one person, or at least a somewhat unified passion. Or after this I can't see how they can't fade away to the fair circuit that they've overcome being the best band on the planet for the last 30 years until now. The legacy is just amazing, but now...?<br /><br />Even White Snakes latest release (2012) Forever More has so much more passion, and David C is like 70... Or listen to Trixter's \\"Tatoo's and Misery\\" - 20 years later, or how Iron Maiden can release albums like the Final Frontier, that have so much passion and originality even after so many years.<br />jason<br /><br />PS: as a fairly successful international artist in a different way, I've only succeeded and grown because of the people I work with, constantly questioning myself on results, and not surrounding myself with a fan boy sentimentality saying everything I do is awesome... just saying /hugs Jon. But come on. You're better than this :-P You're a smart guy. Successful, rich and have survived better than any. Don't fall in the trap though. Question and fight those things.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This is the story behind the headlines:  what one particular scorned wife did after her husband cheated on her.  Some episodes are more gripping than others but it makes one think about the consequences of immorality on the family.  Each person is affected, even the husband pays a price.  But will the family recover and stay united in love and trust?  Do they deserve to recover and can the sinner really pay the price he deserves to pay?  Does the wife really right a wrong when she has an affair too?  The series attempts to show this and does a pretty good job of it.  However, there does not seem to be payment in kind for the wife when her behavior is as bad as her husbands'.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was impossible to put down.  The characters were so well developed I longed to know them.  I have read many books from this time period but never from the perspective of an indentured servant raised by slaves.  Fascinating read!

B00B4W8AIW|5.0|I was a little worried about this one with the change in frontman but wow, this record is really good.  When the first track kicked in I thought it was the same old band, quickly the new vocalist became clear but it wasn't such a drastic change that it threw off the feel of the album for me.  I'm pleased with this release!

0525478817|4.0|Who knew that depressing and funny could be woven together so seamlessly and beautifully? Well, I didn't quite realize it until I started reading this awesome book by John Green. Hazel has this dry humor that I love, and Augustus is witty and blunt--it really does make for a sweet combo.<br />  I really flew through this one and loved most everything about it. I enjoyed how sweet relationship between Hazel and Gus, plus their friendship with Isaac. The conversations were so realistic, and made me laugh. Both Hazel and Gus' parents were every kind of amazing and involved. I loved the side quest with the author Houten. He was hateful and disappointing but inspiring somehow all at the same time. The characters are amazingly flawed and maybe that is what made me love it.<br />  It was very down at times but that made it all the more realistic... It is about kids dying and fighting cancer, and cancer sucks. And let's face it, life sucks sometimes too. And Green embraces that through his writing.<br />  I really don't have a lot to add except that it is powerful and I recommend it. There are so many glowing reviews, well deserved.<br />Bottom Line: Deliciously heart wrenching and hilarious.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|First time purchasing instant watch, however very easy to access with no interuptions. Great show and didn't want to wait to catch up. Definitely would recommend.

I missed some of the original songs but my girls (who haven't seen the original) loved it.  Overall it was a great remake of a classic with enough of a new twist that it kept it interesting.
B002T921DE|5.0|I've rented this DVD a few times so I decided to buy it. What a fantastic artist George is, this DVD really shows it off. For me he's one of the most talented artists around. Only hope we hear more from him. You won't be disappointed if you love great talent.
B004SMD4H2|4.0|The first season has imaginative story telling and good character development.  Some of the stories are a little silly, but most of the first season is clearly not predicatable.  High mystery with intrigue and action.  Would not really call it scary in today's market.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A very quick read with a good story premise, well told by the author.  Even if you are not familiar with Jack Reacher, the story has enough character development to you interested.

B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|British singer Dido arrived on the scene in 1999 with her debut \\"No Angel\\". Her album was produced by her brother/labelmate at Arista Records- Rollo of the electronic band Faithless. Though the album was well received by critics, it took a while before the first couple of singles caught on. Fast forward over a year later, when she received exposure by way of Eminem- who sampled her song \\"Thank You\\" in his seven minute opus about an obsessed fan \\"Stan\\". From there Arista released \\"Thank You\\" as a single, which brought the public's attention to the singer. Fast forward three years later, she worked with her brother again on her second album \\"Life For Rent\\". While the recording was successful in her native homeland, it was a minor success in the United States. Most of that had to do with the corporate structure behind the scenes at her label. Five years had passed by the time she released her next album- the Jon Brion produced \\"Safe Trip Home\\". She laid low for five more years and released her fourth album on her new label RCA Records \\"Girl Who Got Away\\".<br /><br />Her new album marks a return to her electronica roots. After a ten year separation, she is reunited with her producer Rollo. Sonically, \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" picks up where \\"No Angel\\" left off. On the opening track \\"No Freedom\\", she muses over a pending breakup. She desires to live life to the fullest and takes chances on the title track \\"Girl Who Got Away\\". For the second time in her career, she works with a rapper- this time around it's California rapper Kendrick Lamar on the song about hitting a rocky patch in a relationship \\"Let Us Move On\\". On the song \\"Blackbird\\", she rides a rhythm that's probably the most uptempo song she's recorded. She deals with a nasty breakup on \\"End Of Night\\" and desires a place of solitude on the acoustic ballad \\"Sitting on The Roof Of The World\\". She expresses her thoughts on her feelings on \\"Go Dreaming\\" and closes the album with the ballad \\"Day Before We Went To War\\". While \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" is a welcomed return for Dido, one would get the feeling that she's playing it safe this time around. Despite the production being noticeably subdued, it's still a strong album from the underrated singer.\\"Girl Who Got Away\\" is a welcomed return for Dido, one would get the feeling that she's playing it safe this time around.

B009AJDDQU|5.0|This movie is an amazing visual triumph. For two hours the cinematography alone will keep you glued to the screen. The acting is top notch and easily oscar worthy. The soundtrack is perfect and the scares are spot on. The only complaint I'd have about this movie is that it isn't longer and leaves a lot of questions unasnwered but it is part one of a trilogy so hopefully later on they will be answered.<br /><br />There's several plot holes and stupid typical movie mistakes of humans making poor decisions but it's easily made up for just how entertaining this movie is.

B000089HCR|4.0|With the resurgence of heavy metal music in the early-to-mid 1980's (which helped to fend off the late-decade arrival of punk-rock music in the Seventies), W.A.S.P., a Los Angeles-based quintet, could not have picked a better time to release their self-titled debut. But this 1984 effort was heavier, angrier, rawer, and more shocking than most music at the time. And, as a matter of fact, compared to most bands that were occupying much of the room on store shelves (hard rock and glam metal bands like Ratt, AC-DC, Motley Crue, etc.), W.A.S.P. sounded almost downright brutal.  Blackie Lawless' rough and flinty vocals spin the tale of heavy metal's usual standbys (lyrics that are anti-establishment and pro-sex and Satan, etc.) laid against a coarse and propulsive bed of belligerent riffing, heavy bass lines, and energetic drumming.<br /><br />The album opens with the lead single \\"I Wanna Be Somebody,\\" a Motorhead-meets-Judas Priest-esque slab of proto speed metal. Suffice it to say, this is a surefire blistering, driving, and propulsive opener, and one that is further highlighted by a stirring chorus. \\"L.O.V.E. Machine\\" has a similarly huge, classically catchy and memorable chorus; but overall, this song differs from the one that preceded it in that it is much more mid-tempo. And \\"The Flame\\" also has a killer chorus that is all-but guaranteed to knock around your head for a while, and furthers it with more exceptional guitar soloing.<br /><br />\\"B.A.D.\\" and \\"Sleeping (In The Fire)\\" are the set's two ballads. The former is a power ballad at least in that it is much slower and more restrained-sounding than anything that came before it, although it is backed by crunchy, churning guitar licks and deranged, shredding solos. And the latter of these two songs, \\"Sleeping,\\" is also not without its fair share of substantial heaviness, as a lengthy and winding melodic solo does come screaming by in it.<br /><br />Elsewhere, cuts like \\"Hellion\\" and the closing \\"The Torture Never Stops\\" both boast big, fat, juicy, crunching riffs, Judas Priest-y falsetto vocals, and a fairly dazzling, trade-off solo section. (And the first of these two songs also features Venom-influenced lyricism.) And then there is a track like \\"On Your Knees,\\" which is another piece of borderline speed metal that closely evokes the almighty Priest, and is the pedestal to further showcase the guitarists' piercing and wailing solo skills.<br /><br />\\"W.A.S.P.\\" was easily the best and most successful effort of the band's storied career. The fact that the album would go on to achieve gold certification (something that not every heavy metal album can say) is testament to this fact. As such, it is pretty much essential listening for all heavy music aficionados. And if you're gonna own it, then you need to get the re-released issue of the record, which comes complete with three bonus tracks, including a cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"Paint It Black,\\" and the sex-craved fan favorite Animal (Like A Beast).\\"ps\\" both boast big, fat, juicy, crunching riffs, Judas Priest-y falsetto vocals, and a fairly dazzling, trade-off solo section.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like it. Especially the big gorilla! I think it's better than the first one. This version is so different and its a good game to play when your bored lol
B00008BXJG|5.0|Oiy, there is so little that can be said about this album that hasn't already been said. But heck, I'll give it a shot, anyways.<br /><br />Back in the great year of 1979, heavy metal was still in its primitive, infantile form. At the time, it was a taboo subject, and one that was frequently only thought of as a good time. Thus, AC-DC were a turning point for the hard rock and metal genres, as very few groups were as controversial, dirty, and/or dangerous as this Australian five-piece.<br /><br />Then frontman Bon Scott (who would pass away in 1980 from acute alcohol poisoning -- a true rock `n' roll death, indeed!) wails away throughout \\"Highway To Hell\\"'s ten tracks, waging war against a musical bed comprised of large, metallic guitar licks, equally-as-wailing solos, basic, 4/4 drum patterns, and dirty, washed-out-sounding bass. Lyrically, Scott covers such not-so-hush-hush topics as Hades, murder, girls, sex, and parties. As a result, the record forms a crude, and almost punk-like attitude, and an enormously influential template for literally trillions of bands to come.<br /><br />From the opening guitar notes of the eponymous lead-off track, \\"Highway To Hell\\" practically screams that it is a classic opener. And sure enough, with its rhythmic drum beat, simple-yet-classic, mosh-pit-ready choruses, swinging groove, and vocals and lyrics that are not easy to forget, the song is soon made into a cuh-lassic one, and a worthy hit/lead single. And the rest of the album might not quite stack up as well as \\"Highway,\\" but there are certainly other standouts. \\"Girl's Got Rhythm,\\" for example, boasts simple yet effective and catchy riffs, a winding and shredding solo, and more powerful, universally-renowned vocals and choruses. Then \\"Walk All Over You\\" brings back those same really memorable vocal patterns, and augments them with more wailing guitar solo runs. \\"Touch Too Much\\" is also highlighted by two more instinctively memorable, soaring, and high-flying solos that makes the listener's air-guitar fingers itch; but it is \\"Beating Around The Bush\\" that takes the cake for featuring what is perhaps the album's best and most memorable and wailing solo work. (And the tune's hooky staccato guitar groove and moving lyrics are nothing to sneeze at, either.)<br /><br />Other highlights include \\"Shot Down In Flames,\\" which has a simplistic-yet-ultra-catchy, bobbing riff slice threaded by still more exceptional guitar soloing; the beeping, grumbling bass line and anthemic choruses that back \\"Love Hungry Man\\"; and the closing \\"Night Prowler,\\" an indisputably bluesy, infectiously swinging rocker that takes on a concertedly more mid-tempo approach without being a ballad. And some more absolutely terrific soloing is found here, as well. And, of course, the track is also of note for its ominous and highly controversial lyricism, which stems from the Richard Ramirez serial killings in 1965.<br /><br />Contrary to what you may believe, \\"Highway To Hell\\" is NOT AC-DC's debut. In fact, some newbie fans might be astonished to learn that this is the Australian's raucous rockers' sixth (!) album. The thing is, \\"H2H\\" is the group's breakthrough album because they were never so wildly successful (from both a commercial and creative/musical point of view) up until now. And, the following year's \\"Back In Black\\" aside, AC-DC were never this successful doing what they do again. So while \\"Highway\\" may not be quite as essential as that 1980 album, it is still a pretty darn classic album, and an essential inclusion in any hard rock and heavy metal collection.the listener's air-guitar fingers itch; but it is \\"Beating Around The Bush\\" that takes the cake for featuring what is perhaps the album's best and most memorable and wailing solo work.

B009ZQJVAK|3.0|For those of you who have watched all those Disney movies with your kids that ALL have basically the same plot and characters, here is the same Disney- like movie, kinked up to blur views of sexuality.<br /><br />It is cute, interesting, has some great musical numbers, like all Disney movies, but at the same time, it could help some to take a more understanding view of non-straight sexuality.<br /><br />Not a bad film, but in my opinion, not as great as many seem to feel it is.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|No slavish disciple of the book, I found the movie entertaining, inventive and beautifully cinematic.  The use of 3D, especially in the Rivendell sequence, is naturalistic and stunning; immersing the viewer and taking your breath at the same time.  The Rings Trilogy casts a mighty long shadow and I agree that this film would benefit from a brisker pace, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it highly.

B0089AD8IO|5.0|I have to admit, from the start of this I knew 9 would never be one of my favorite Doctors.  He does get good from episode 5 onwards, but even then he's nowhere near as good as David Tennant, Matt Smith, or Tom Baker.  Still, it was worth buying.<br /><br />The following synopsizes come from me &/or Wikipedia.<br /><br />1.  Rose: The story of how a girl named Rose Tyler came to know our favorite Doctor after being attacked by mannequins.  For the triumphant return of Doctor Who to TV, this isn't very special.  It's not bad, for the most part it's good, but I hate the scene at the end where the Doctor hesitates to destroy the Nestene consciousness & Rose hesitates to help him, resulting in one of my favorite characters being fired at (I refuse to believe he died).  Apart from that it's fine though.  C+<br /><br />2. The End of the World: The Doctor takes Rose to see the end of the Earth in the distant future.  Better than the last one, though there was still an annoying moment of hesitation.  B<br /><br />3.  The Unquiet Dead: The Doctor & Rose go to Cardiff in 1869, where they meet Charles Dickens & encounter what appear to be ghosts possessing the bodies of the dead.  Now this is a great episode.  The atmosphere is good & the guy they got to play Dickens was perfect.  A-<br /><br />4.  Aliens of London: An alien spaceship crashes into Big Ben, drawing attention.  But it turns out to be a hoax.  It starts off good, but starts to suck somewhere around the midway mark.  C-<br /><br />5. World War 3:  Earth is in danger of being destroyed by the Slitheen.  When I realized this would be a 2-parter, I thought \\"Oh no!  An even worse episode awaits me.\\"  But big surprise, this episode starts off strong & stays that way.  Not 100% perfect (Jackie Tyler annoyed me), but pretty darn close.  A<br /><br />6.  Dalek:  The Doctor & Rose find themselves near Salt Lake City, Utah in 2012 in an underground bunker owned by a rich collector of alien artifacts after the TARDIS is drawn off course by a signal.  The signal turns out to come from the last surviving Dalek.  This is the first perfect episode of the season.  A+<br /><br />7.  The Long Game:  The Doctor, Rose, and their new companion Adam travel to the year 200,000 and land on the space station Satellite 5, which controls journalism.  The Doctor finds out that ever since the satellite began broadcasting, something has held the human race's attitude and technology back, so he investigates.  I won't say anymore, because it's a great episode.  A<br /><br />8. Father's Day:  The Doctor takes Rose back in time to see her father before he died, but she saves his life, and the change in history could spell doom for everyone.  This is a fantastic episode.  My personal favorite of the season.  A+<br /><br />9.-10. The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances: I'm just going to combine both of these since my opinion of the is the same.  Chasing a metal cylinder marked as \\"dangerous\\" through the Time Vortex, & they land during the Blitz in World War II.  There, they face a creepy child wearing a gas mask & meet Captain Jack Harkness, a pansexual human from the 51st century.  I'm going to be honest: I hate Captain Jack.  But that's the only bad thing I have to say about this story.  A<br /><br />11.  Boom Town:  The Doctor, Rose, and Jack visit Cardiff to refuel the TARDIS at the rift, and Mickey meets them there. They discover that the Slitheen impersonating Margaret Blaine is now the mayor of Cardiff and capture her, suspicious of what she has done. The Doctor sees that she has created a nuclear power plant designed to open the rift and destroy Earth, and a device she would use to flee.  Rose was at her worst here, but apart from that it's good.  B+<br /><br />12.-13.  The Doctor, Jack & Rose wake up with amnesia on various reality television & game shows.  The Doctor & Jack escape & the Doctor realizes he's back on Satellite 5, 100 years later.  And an old enemy is waiting in the shadows to attack.  I have to admit, although 9'll never be my favorite Doctor, this is the perfect ending to the season.  A+<br /><br />So overall I'm satisfied with the season, but I'm not sad he was only the Doctor for one season.  David Tennant would quickly prove to be much better.  But as for where I'd rank 9, I'm not sure.  I know who my least favorite Doctor is (William Hartnell), & you know my top 3 Doctors.  My next 3 would be Jon Pertwee, Sylvester McCoy & Peter Davison, in that order.  Then it would be Patrick Troughton,  Colin Baker, & Christopher Eccleston, but I don't know what order.  I'll have to see more of 2 & 6 to find out.  I also have yet to see Paul McGann, so who knows what my ranking will be like when he comes in.

1936891026|5.0|If you never read past the first two sections (What I Do & What I know), covering less than two pages, you will still be transformed by this book, provided you are open to being transformed. Most reviews here are five star but I was surprised to see 30 one-star reviews. I read most of them trying to understand why a book that resonated with me so much would put off so many people. Maybe it's as simple as the right message at the right time for me, but I don't think it is - I can't see how this would fail to have a significant impact on any writer, artist or entrepreneur. I can't help but feel that some people didn't \\"get\\" this book even though there's nothing complicated about it. As an example, some take issue with the last third of the book where Pressfield gets a bit spiritual about the source of inspiration. I learned from and was inspired by his beliefs and I haven't spent too much time thinking about whether I share those beliefs. To me, that would miss the point. This book does what is says it will do (show you how to overcome creative blocks) and it's a well-crafted, immensely enjoyable read, as any book on writing must be.

B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show. This set is exactly as described, no problems. I'm working on slowly collecting all of them. :)
B005LAII12|5.0|I'll start by saying I have no problem with raunch if done properly like Judd Apatow or Todd Philips.  Add Seth MacFarlane to the list because \\"Ted\\" is side-splittingly funny.  I was skeptical about the premise of a foul-mouthed beer-swilling pot-smoking plush toy but MacFarlane navigates the concept brilliantly.  He leavens the humor with just the right amount of poignancy to give the film resonance.  Aside from his directorial-writer duties MacFarlane gives voice to Ted and deserves kudos for humanizing the CGI image.  Mark Wahlberg deserves props too because it couldn't have been easy playing against what was probably a blank canvass.  I really like how MacFarlane injects pop culture trivia into the proceedings.  His running gags about Sam Jones(Flash Gordon) and Tom Skerritt are a hoot.  My wife is still cracking up over the scene where Giovanni Ribisi's character is dancing to Tiffany's \\"I Think We're Alone Now\\".  This type of film is not for everybody so unless you've been living in a cave and never heard of it you know who you are and whether you're inclined to like \\"Ted\\".

B001A5HBJC|5.0|Mad Men caught my eye as soon as I read that it was set in the 1960's.  Ah, the 1960's. I was 10 in 1960; graduated from high school in 1968.  Watching this television show brings back not only my childhood, but my teenage years as well.  Everything from Selectric typewriters, to switchboards, phones with blinking buttons, eating raw hamburger, and living with parents that smoked and drank as a normal part of life. Add to that list driving drunk, driving without seat belts, kids playing with plastic bags over their head, pregnant women drinking and smoking, and other shocking behavior to curl our toes.<br /><br />Set in New York City in the heyday of advertising agencies in Manhattan, it's an eclectic weave of husbands, housewives, mistresses, secretaries, office politics, and account executives.  It reminds me of those days when anything went.  Men made sexual innuendos to the female office staff, booze was in the offices, and everyone smoked like a chimney. My first time someone flirted with me at my second job in 1969, the bank manager came up and told me I had \\"great legs.\\"  Then in 1972 my boss had me stay late one night and came up behind me and grabbed my breasts.  Wow, I could have sued had that happened today.<br /><br />On top of the outlandish days of sexual harassment in the office, it's mixed with the occurrence of segregation where Negros couldn't ride in the elevators with the working staff unless given permission.  Everyone in the company was white - no mixing of the races like our modern offices today.  Jewish people were treated like aliens that couldn't be understood.  Everyone drank and smoked.  I can remember my first boss in 1968 having a bottle of booze stashed in his desk drawer.  Most of the day he smelled of alcohol.<br /><br />Then there were the women who stayed home - the housewives.  Always with their hair in place, their bouncy little dresses, their kids clean, their houses spotless, and dinner waiting on the table when their husbands came home.  They knew their place, and they kept their place whether they were miserable or happy. It was their way of life, along with eating prime rib and butter for dinner.  The men, of course, lived doubled lives of carousing with other women and having mistresses on the side in or out of the office setting. Married women, who met a divorced woman with two children living alone, was an unthinkable state of affairs.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful, with their own back story of how their childhood and family has molded them into the adults they have become.  Each have their own personal struggles, whether it be with self-worth, a family they wish to forget, a wife with whom they are estranged, an overbearing mother who filled their daughters with expectations, or a father who doesn't support their son's career choice.  The stories are rich in their own right and filled with everybody's pursuit of happiness in the 60's, in one way or the other. Rather than worrying about their smoking, drinking, or butter on their plates, the Communists are the threats, as well as the thought of having a Catholic president.<br /><br />I can't tell you how utterly entertaining this show is, at least for me.  If you didn't grow up in that era, you'll probably find it very strange.  If you did, it will be like walking down memory lane, remembering your childhood, and no doubt your parents.  I can still see my mother who wore a dress every day, had dinner on the table, who hadn't worked out of the home since World War II.  Yes, we have evolved in many ways.  Discrimination and sexism in the office is a thing of the past.  Feminism has taken the women out of the homes and made them executives along side men.  However, a part of me misses the simplicity of those days when life had different complications than we face today.<br /><br />One of my favorites are the girls in the office and how they share the gossip.  A particular scene that had me rolling on the floor happened to bewhen one lady pulled from her purse the novel, \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover,\\" and the women started talking about it.  Of course, it's strictly taboo to read such a book that uses the words no lady would utter and contain such graphic sexual scenes in a book!  One woman asks if she can borrow it to read, and the advice was priceless.  \\"Don't read it on the train.  It will attract all the wrong elements.\\"  What a hoot!  Reminded me of today and women reading Fifty Shades of Grey in public.  Things never really change in some aspects.  We just color it in a different light.<br /><br />Anyway, highly recommend the show.when one lady pulled from her purse the novel, \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover,\\" and the women started talking about it.  Of course, it's strictly taboo to read such a book that uses the words no lady would utter and contain such graphic sexual scenes in a book!  One woman asks if she can borrow it to read, and the advice was priceless.  \\"Don't read it on the train.  It will attract all the wrong elements.\\"  What a hoot!

B000IZ7YMY|5.0|Fear is a powerful emotion, but so is the intense feeling of friendship for people you have grown with.  Heath Ledger is tagged a coward when he resigns his commision when he is told he is being deployed.  The reality of possible death is far to much to handle.  But, he soon finds his way to the desert to keep a watchful eye on his friends/comrades.  Many things happen in the<br />dessert, and in the end, Heath forgets his fear and does everything in his power to get his friends home.  Not all make it, but one<br />thing is clear, Heath is far from being a coward.
B005LAIHGI|1.0|my son wanted this movie because he thought it was going to be funny.  It must be pretty bad since my 15 year old doesn't like it.
B008Y73940|4.0|Easy to watch, not too complicated.  Selected it to watch while catching up on my ironing.  Would recommend it to others.
B008220DGE|3.0|stupid movie great acting though sory i watched the whole movie waiting for it to improve thats all I can say
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|Dumb, dumb, da, dumb, dumb....DUMB!!!!<br />Don't waste your time, really dumb.  Someone please turn on the lights!!!  Literally dark, meaning the guy doesn't think to turn on the lights.  If that makes this scary, then I'd rather just sit alone in the dark in my own house.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The only thing you want when reading a Steig Larsson book is that you want more of them to read. A real loss to fiction.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|A real eye-opener. Should be required reading for everyone from Jr. High on up. A book definitely worth the read. I stayed up most of the night reading it. Very hard to put down.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Really liked where they went with the story, really excited for the next book! Hope it's as good as this one.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I loaded this app into my Kindle Fire HD.  This is the best app for anyone who is used to seeing their computer desktop.  It shows your computer with all it's icons and best of all, they're live.  You can easily navigate to your favorite web pages, check your email and even open your checkbook if you have the software on your computer.  I would recommend this app.
B004LX0D36|1.0|This version is terrible with parts of sentences missing from many pages. I gave up after 8 percent of reading.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Suspense will keep you turning the pages because there are so many surprises in the story line.  The characters are not likable and  the ending left me feeling disappointed so I cannot rate this book 5 or even 4 stars.
B008DM4OTA|2.0|Grandkids got bored quick, needs a few more items in room to click and few more treatments.  My grandma are 4 and 5
B001DLWF8U|5.0|I was interested enough all the way through to try to stay reading it until it was finished.<br />Even then I wanted more.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I enjoyed the book and a nice easy read! It was heart warming and made me cry at times but happy in parts karma means a lot.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|What can I say about Maynard.  If you know who Puscifer is, then you are obviously already a Maynard James Keenan fan.  You will not be disappointed.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Great Fun on the go.  I am not a big game player but do enjoy sitting down once in a while for a break and playing.
B003SI3URQ|4.0|This film is one of our favorite films.  The story is engaging and has some great lessons.  Danny Devito and James Woods add some fantastic comic relief.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like the coin dozer, cause it's a fun realaxing game. This pacific game allows you to win coins, prizes, and puzzle peices
B005C8ENI0|4.0|We enjoyed the movie thoroughly.  The characters are engaging and the story keeps you engaged all the way through.  I thought the portrayal of the relationship between main character, a defense attorney,  and his ex wife, a public prosecutor, was well done.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|I loved the case prep strategy Cheng lays out, and I felt it was very helpful in both style and substance.  The fact that this book gets you free access to most of his website is decent, too, although at times it feels a bit like an advertising gambit.<br /><br />With that said, as the subtitle alludes to (&#34;a former McKinsey . . . &#34;), Cheng refers to his own resume a bit too often.  If you can't stand self-promotion you may find that he grates on your nerves.  However, I would still recommend trying to ignore the boasting and taking his advice to heart.
B003DXSXCI|3.0|The movie was interesting.  I enjoyed the highlighting of new technology at the time like the fax.  The movie is actually very quiet with sections of almost no sound.  An enjoyable watch but not a repeat.
B004J64QSI|5.0|My fave play/musical ever, so this is a must have for any Les Mis collection. Other than the original London cast, this is my favorite rendition.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|found it is better than most 007's. Be ready for watching it through from the very beginning. You won't want to pause it...
0374214913|4.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is a quick, fun read. Written for the entertainment of bibliophiles, the book takes us on an adventure through the shadier shelves of bookstores. The author's amusing voice, punctuated by regular quips, keeps a smile on your face as each chapter leads you into the next. There are, however, two major plot-holes in the story: 1) the author seems to be under the impression that most people under 40 rock-climb once a week, and 2) we must pretend that web designers and even Google employees would actually use a Mac. If you can get past those two artifices, you will be happy to have read this book.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|Well, I would LOVE to give this movie a fantastic review but I can't. It could have gotten away with three stars I guess, but I gave it two. Full of action of course, a decent amount of blood and guts but the story line left some to be desired. Thing is, there was not much background on the main characters. The ONE we were allowed to know about was wonderful, but disconnected. It's a good movie (not B at all) but it could have been a heck of a lot better. I don't know. Try it. You might like it.
B00A83075M|5.0|Such a cute movie with a great story line!  Kids and I both loved it!  It is a must see!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This was good. Not fantastic but good and was definitely funny in a couple of spots. I wouldn't rent it \\"again\\" mind you but it's good for at least one viewing.
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|The DVD cover was not very appealing, there were a bunch of scratches on the case. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|This movie is by far my favorite movie , I loved all the actors , especially Sonny , C and Robert Dinero , I can watch this movie over , and over again. I seriously recommend this movie , I am so happy I watched it. Promise you'll like it , ( :
B00200K2UG|4.0|The 5612, despite description, was not large enough to fit my cameras and tele lenses, so I returned it and ordered its big brother that fortunately fits the bill.<br /><br />The Pro 13 comfortably holds everything that I wish to pack: D700 mounted with 70-200f2.8 vrii, D40 with 70-200f4 vrii attached, SB-700, several lenses, teleconverters, iPad or 11&#34; MBA, memory cards, etc.  The bag is super heavy fully packed, but at least I can haul all of my gear with me, and I don't have to compromise with regards to what I can and can't take with me when I travel.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think it was an awesome book and it made me feel like a rebellion. Although, it was hard to understand at the end of the book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's so interesting how you go to a different subject and keep going I really don't know how to explain.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Typical Denzel Brilliance, JOHN GOODMAN really steals the show. One of the best movies I have ever seen. Don Cheadle plays a great role also. Its the type of movie you can watch over and over!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the most relaxing, enjoyable game!! When I wake up and can't sleep, I play Solitaire! ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!
B000FA675C|5.0|Start in the Louvre and then travel to seek the Grail.  This is one of the best Grail Stories told in modern times.  Weaves to Grail and conspiracy theories in and out of the life of Robert Langdon.  A great introduction to Robert Langdon and Brown's &#34;Art Detective&#34;<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I am not going to tell you the entire story - read the book or see the sample.  CAUTION: If you read the sample you might be hooked.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|The gameplay is pretty straightforward, the credits are easy to come by, the multi player mode is fun, and the single player story mode is challenging enough to keep you glued to your screen, hoping to get past that next zombie wave.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I simply loved this book<br />I'm a Lean/Kanban practitioner focused on the Software/product development world so I was familiar with most of the concepts. Still, got a lot out of the book, enjoyed yet, and would highly recommend it to clients and other practitioners.<br /><br />Minor spoilers below...<br /><br />The last segments about going the extra mile extending the value stream to the business, driving business agility as require by business drivers, and the ability to learn faster really bring home the value and potential of going towards Lean in IT. I hope this book has the effect on the IT world that is mentioned tongue in cheek in the last chapter.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love playing this game the levels are cool an helped me in my life when my mom was real sick an we were in the hospitals for days that didn't seem to end. I had something I could do to take my mind off all that for a bit.
B00BF11STU|2.0|i was quite bored. the only part that was interesting was the reenactment of the capture. the quality of the video watch through my wii was excellent.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game to play to help the day go by. Never spent a dime to level up refills really fast foe engry
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great book! Can't wait to read the next book.  The  book was so tense at the end that I stayed up way to late trying to finish.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soo freaking awesome it's just unexplainablely awesome it's better than temple run and anyone who has never played it NEEDS to play it
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book takes you on a journey where the main character attempts to find a treasure that he dreamed about. He believes the journey to be his Personal Legend or calling. Throughout the journey he learns many things that will help him realize his dream. By the end of the book, I could not avoid thinking about my own life and what I believed to be my personal calling. And I asked myself if I was doing everything in my possession to realize it. Just like me, any reader will find it easy to relate to this book because its message is so clear: follow your dreams; don't be afraid of rejection or failure; it is okay to make mistakes; everything will fall into place once you start your journey. For this particular reason I recommend this book to everyone at any stage in life. This truly is a wonderful book with a beautiful timeless message that everyone should read and apply to their own life.
B0078Q2HAA|1.0|I hated the movie. If I had known it was about a dementia-ridden woman speaking to her deceased husband I would never have watched it. I kept thinking it has to get better. But it never did.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The 74th Hunger Games ended, there are two victors and they returned to District 12 where they could resume their lives not having to worry about ever starving again... except there is a mind-boggling twist in this book that will keep you reading. This book presents many interesting underlying messages about oppression of the poor, resistance and most of all manipulation. By the end of the first book you cannot avoid falling in love with Katniss and unfortunately, this second book makes her a scapegoat. Nonetheless, you will be cheering for her until the end.
B009EE1GC4|5.0|I loved this movie so I got it for my mother to enjoy too. Wonderful cast and story lines, beautiful flavor of India.<br /><br />Update: And now I've actually been to India and the areas where the movie was filmed, and it's a very accurate depiction of India today. Just watching it again makes me want to go back!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down until I finished it and even then I wanted more! This book is not a stereotypical story about the future where aliens coexist with humans, human cloning is a thing of the past, and cars fly. Suzanne Collins creates a somber image of a future in, which resources are exhausted, basic human rights are distorted and the oppression of the poor is the only mean to assure that the rich get richer and the poor get by (if they are lucky). I would say that she takes some of the prominent issues that we have today and creates a world in which their extremity unfolds into the unimaginable barbaric event that is known as The Hunger Games. This book is must read!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is not my genre and I never would have picked it up if it wasn't for other reviews.<br />I have some advice for anyone smart enough to buy this book.<br />1. Make sure you don't have any plans for the next 48-72 hours (some of that time is for sleep)<br />2. Find some small talk that you can throw into your conversations with others that Don't involve raving about this.
B002VHI8FE|3.0|I've seen many reviews complaining about the editing in this book. Yes it is lacking in some ways this actually improves the book.  There is a brutal rawness that comes through that may have been glossed up otherwise.<br />An altogether entertaining read. I look forward to his other books.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|If I didn't read for my book club I probably would not have finished it.  While I love gardening, I wasn't drawn to the story or eager to find some time to sit and read on until the last section.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Drama, Action, Stories Amazing! Want more and more, Can't wait to Watch Season 3! Great Writing, Actors, & Stories, Love it!
B0081BU42O|2.0|It is difficult to describe my synopsis of this book; novel subject matter, excellent use of metaphor, but still lacking color. he drones on for pages discussing minor philosophical themes of questionable significance, decidedly soporific. I found myself skipping paragraphs, then whole pages, even several pages only to find I hadn't lost any content. you know how a good Sci Fi makes you anxious to get back to it and find out what's in store next? This is not one of those books. I would echo the person who described it as slow moving and boring. I rarely could get past a few pages without falling asleep. Finally I just couldn't even finish it and left it only 60% read. I have read Banks'. books in the past an found them excellent. This one was not worth the price, but I see most other reviewers do not agree.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Drama, Action, Stories Amazing! Want more and more, Can't wait to Watch Season 4! Great Writing, Actors, & Stories, Love it!
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Disappointed that the secret will be revealed in the next chronicle. Expected more out of a 3rd chronicle... wonder if Archer can sustain the fan club for the chronicles if plans a few more...
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Great app so far. Will update later. The only problem so far is alarm sound is to low. Even when turned up.
B00BI745AA|4.0|This is a very well done version of Les Miserables.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I found the director's choice of constant full face close-ups while singing almost a distraction.
B003VTZSFY|5.0|A fascinating and some times surprising overview of human history since the end of the last glaciation, including a credible explanation for the existence of the 12,000 year old monumental structures at Gobleki Tepe.
B0094M4NW6|5.0|This is a musical that I can sit down and watch over and over again.  My 18 year old daughter was amazed that I knew all the words to all the songs.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Thank God for having men such as this to protect all of us. It should behoove everyone read about the Seals, military, both marines and army special forces who are given the dirty job of fighting the islamic famatics who desperately want our complete destruction.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen's account of the capture and elimination of Osama bin Laden was gripping and hold your breath good. I could not put this book down. If you have any interest in military history this book is a must read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|calculator plus is the best calculator you could ask for. the main reason is simple. lt. is EASY TO USE! Thay didn't ruin it by making it complicated.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It is very different from most of today's novels.  It tells of the horrors of orphanages finally closed; the story of a couple of adopted survivors.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I have seen 2 episodes so far, & I love the whole idea of the show & I am quickly learning to love the lead actress, Tatiana Maslany!!!!!!!!!! This girl/lady is an extremely talented actress and &#34;extremely beautiful/good looking/hot/sexy&#34;!!!!!!! She has to play clones/different personalities/people of herself/or people that look just like her in each episode & so far she has done an excellent job!!!!!! I am really looking forward to seeing more of this show!!!!!!!!!!

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Got amazon prime at Christmas, so now I get to watch all these older seasons - this series is not for everyone, but I think it's great
B00BRR66SA|4.0|JT has really put together a great album. Lyrics are great and album has a great flow and beat! Recommend buying!
B004SH40BQ|3.0|It worked great except it is not able to transer the cover artwork for the artist, song title etc.....If you do not care about seeing the artist and cd cover art, then it works flawlessly.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really dislike being &#34;required&#34; to write a narrative review of the books and products I purchase. I'm not opposed to providing feedback via the five star rating system Amazon has provided. Its the primary reason I rarely give any of review at all.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Acting very, very good for all main players but staging so dark in many scenes that it was difficult to see what was happening (after movies are a visual experience)!  Even trying to mimic candlelight, it was too dark -- I get more light with fewer candles in my house!<br />Story line was soft, rambling, not tight and cohesive.
B008393Q2O|3.0|it is an ok app. not what i expected for this type of app. i will have to look around more.
B004X4QW42|5.0|This easily rates in my All Time Top 10! Inspires the desire to learn more about this unique martial arts style.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|this is a good app. i like how you can change the color of the book. i would like it if they would let you change the page color though.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|First downloaded the app, images from the gallery were not importing completely. Contacted the app people and let them know what the problem, 3 days later an update with a fix.<br /><br />This app is just awesome, the only limitation is ones imagination.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game !!! Addicting ! Even my kids and husband play it ! I would recommend this to any f my friends.
B0060MYK7G|1.0|The 3rd disc was a repeat of 2nd disc<br />how do I fix this it was agift for my Mom and she is disappointed
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|This was a pretty good game.  Had to use hints a few times to get to the next task.  I think $4.99 was a little pricey but oh well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IT IS THE BEST POSSIBLE PRICE FOR THE BEST GAME AND THE REST ASSURED THAT THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER SINCE I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE WORLD.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to pass the time. I love the different options of how I may play the game plus the stats and rankings.
0817439390|5.0|This is a very good book! Has lots of tips and explains clearly how to take better images. Instead of gear it rely on techniques. Your photography will improve after reading this book.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It kept my interest the whole time I couldn't wait to get back to the book. The ending was good but I thought it would be better.
B0041G68KU|5.0|I particularly enjoy Susan Hill's style of writing in this; her ghost story genre. Having written that, I also enjoy her 'Simon Series'. Ms Hill is indeed versatile.
0618526412|2.0|I guess I'm not literary enough to enjoy this book.I guess I'm not literary enough to enjoy this book.Enough said
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you have any illusions of being an humorous astronaut - read this. There is nothing to dislike about this subject or how it has been portrayed in this novel.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Great end, did not see that coming - great read.  Again Stephen Hunter brings fiction to to real world of possibilities.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The series is exciting and Michael Chiklis is very convincing as Vic.  It's one of the better police shows on TV
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm not a British movie fan, but I LOVE Downton Abbey.  I can't wait for Season 4 to air.  Try it.
B00BJUQP4A|5.0|GREAT LOVE STORY FOR ALL YA ALL! THE AUTHOR, A CAMERA AND A DOG. WELL DONE! I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO A SECOUND EDITION. KEEP UP THE FUN AND GOOD WORK!
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|If you have kids and are anything over 25, you will find this movie hilarious. It was nice to see Judd Apatow do something a little more serious. One of his better movies.
B00991TCOG|5.0|The unique combination of violin and electronic type music is nothing short of great.  I'm not even really into any sort of electronic or techno music and I still find myself wanting to listen to this album over and over.  I would definitely recommend you give this album a listen.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved the characters in this book and it really showed what life was like in the 1800s...we should be grateful for what we have today!
B000LMPE0S|5.0|I finally converted over this disc to CD.<br /><br /> Nice to hear the remastering and the additions tracks are great as well. One of the best Hackett album ever. I am enjoying this very much.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|Stunning graphics(ya, the stop and omg type),  awesome open adventure, character customization, enemies have personality and look amazing.  Kindle Fire HD needs more compatible apps(real bad - you can't even get shadowgun - it says not compatible).  This game is stellar and I'll keep an eye on crescent moon games from now on!!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love this show i noticed it last year so i watched all the previous seasons i really like it the actors are great it is a really good thrill some parts of the shoe makes me at the edge of my seat . It's a great shoe
B009FZHYKU|3.0|a zombie show, is about Zombie's not who gets the town or who gets the prison. lots of politics not enough oh s*** where do we go? that prison isn't going to hold forever. if it were me I would try to make my way to Catalina. in the next season something better happen or else I might quit mid way through. oh and yes like 3 main characters died this season WTF? im pritty sure AMC is going to nix this at 5. all I ask is that the story gets exicting. oh and last question, that helicopter in atlanta in the first episode of the first season and the last episode of the second season, where was it?
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|I agree with other reviews, the movie is a bit long.  My husband enjoyed it, I thought it was entertaining.  Later, I did walk away kind of thinking &#34;eh.&#34; Parts of it were funny, in fact, the first half was kind of light-hearted and enjoyable but then there was a point when we were like &#34;whoa.  that's kind of heavy.&#34;<br />So, if there is nothing else left to watch, this one is good.  It's not bad, just not the comedy the trailer portrays.
B00821PCJS|3.0|I really liked the show, but I have to admit, it was mostly as a guilty pleasure. The show should have been much better than it was. The two leads are very likeable; the aliens are well done, and the acting and writing is, well, mostly well done. However, there is just so much soapy melodrama in between what I would have considered &#34;realistic post-alien invasion&#34; moments, that it also got really old. Any time something emotionally important comes up, people stare longingly, the music wells up, a long slow zoom starts... those scenes are very tiresome, and numerous. All of those could have been cut by two-thirds the time and still have had a good impact.<br /><br />There are other flaws I won't bother picking on, because I could ignore them. That one alone makes the series move very slowly overall, but when it does move, it's very enjoyable, and I wanted to watch the next episode quickly each time to find out what happened next. I probably would not have stuck with it had I not watched it on Prime and had to wait a week in between. I look forward to watching the next season, but I have a feeling it will try my patience and I'll move on after that.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|I loved this book. It was an interesting read and very informative! A lot of the information was stuff I never would have known if not for reading this book. I highly recommend it!
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I was eagerly anticipating this album.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I think I am one of those that respects the band's evolution, but still hopes they will put out another Pump.  Perhaps my favorite off this release is \\"Out Go the Lights.\\"  I agree with others - probably too many \\"ballads.\\"
B00993G41S|5.0|Kevin Kline is one of my favorites. This is a movie I could and have watched several times. It is great comedy.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|There is a surprisingly low number of actual &#34;scares&#34; in this movie, but the atmosphere that is constructed is enough to make the intended scares all the more terrifying.  It's a work of horror art, although I do not recommend listening to the English dub, it is distractingly awful. If the language barrier is an issue, then this may be difficult to enjoy, but it is definitely worth watching!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is a decent series, engaging and entertaining, has beautiful scenery and is wholesome for families.  I love it for a relaxing evening.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Love tom Cruise Co actor, he is hot. Has a nice ass in those slacks.  And the black chick was hot to.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I really like the Spider game and the different settings that are available. Thank You for the great entertainment. Give the game a try. I think you will like it.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|This was my first time reading Scalzi and I was pleasently surprised.  It was a thrilling introduction to new way of thinking.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes fast moving, sometimes exciting, sometime funny - always entertaining books.  I plan to read all the books in this series and will be checking out others.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|No matter how many times I read these three books I am always completely entranced. The totalitarian ways of this futuristic world are quite realistic in our future. I find it absolutely fascinating. The characters are ones that anyone can relate to in one way or another, and who can resist a love triangle? Collins writing is a masterpiece and I'm sure I'll read  it at least 4 more times!
B006PGL7OQ|2.0|First, you must try to endure the mind numbing slow pace of this film. Michael Shannon's character spends most of the movie with the \\"deer caught in the headlights\\" look after having several \\"prophetic\\" type dreams about a storm and several other terrifying events.  His bizarre behavior is forgivable under the circumstances but it takes nearly the entire movie before he can share his dreams with his family who has now gone through numerous ordeals because of him and his torment. But the worst is the end.  A bad storm finally comes and the he and his family spend the night in the storm shelter that he built at the cost of his home and his job.  However, the next morning arrives and after a strong bit of encouragement from his wife he opens the door only to find the storm did little damage at all.  Shannon's character then heads the advice of a doctor and leaves town for a while to unwind. The final scene has the family at a beach in South Carolina having a nice time when they all notice a terrible storm coming off the ocean.  The movie then ends abruptly.  You are left to wonder about his complete ordeal and the value of it.  Ultimately I felt the ending made the entire movie worthless and ruined all the character and plot development that had been done.  This could've been a good movie if the ending weren't so strange.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Well worth watching!  Would strongly recommend.  There was a definitely a reason that this picture got an Academy award for best picture.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Couldn't finish...could hardly begin.  Just bad.  I'm definitely too old for this genre anyway but have been able enjoy other similar books.  Just silly and uninteresting.  Sorry!  :(
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Very powerful.  Not the way that one would expect the flick to go.  Denzel Washington was fabulous.  Strongly recommend it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I LIKED THE GAME BUT I HAD A HARD TIME WITH BUYING THE MATERIALS I NEEDED I EITHER DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH OR THE LEVELS DIDNT ADVANCE I GOT FRUSTRATED
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Very  difficult to follow.  Hoped it would get better.  Watched half and then shut it off.  Just say no !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesomeness fun. I am obsessed with this game. Its fun to get all the new characters and boards!!  I highly recommend
B001UTW7QU|5.0|What an awesome series. It's king of like a throw back to the X-Files but with a lot more strange stuff and no aliens.
B000V6OMU2|5.0|Quintessential Bob Marley...how can you go wrong with this...one of his best albums! Three Little Birds is probably the happiest song ever written.
B005PK56TA|2.0|Too much killing for me. Very strange series about a house that kills all it's occupants. I only got to episode 3 and then I was sick of all the death.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read all 3-books. Enjoyed them and the movie was a good representation of the first book. Recommend to my friends.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This app has a very simple idea to it... Kill off the world.  To do this takes a lot of strategy though. This app really tunes in to what could happen in the real world, and for that reason, this is a great app for anyone who would like to really get in to a game and have to think about it.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I love Muse and this album blew me away! They have a different sound(at least to me) on each album and this one was so awesome!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game, love to play it at the fair. Just wish it gave more coins to start the game with. My 4 yo loves it and tries to put down 3 to 4 coins at a time so they run out quick.
B001HN697M|5.0|I have to say I love the &#34;underworld&#34; series. It is by far one of the best vampire franchises around.
B008AYA7WE|5.0|I love the game and have it on my phone and tablet. Even my 4 yo gets into the action. Easy enough for kids to enjoy.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|This has got to be one of the most original movies for kids and parents also to enjoy together as a family!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this app it helps me find my inner child I always play it everyday since I got the app
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Every CPU deserves to have their Arctic Silver 5 Polysynthetic Silver Thermal Compound Paste 3.5g  shipped to them as quickly as mine was.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Oblivion will be criticized for its lack of originality, and this may be deserved, but what it lacks in mind blowing plot twists it makes up for in energy, presentation, and overall effect.<br /><br />The movie creates two contrasting worlds brilliantly: the clinical 2001esque angles of the cloud condo and drone technology, complete with an ominous hal-like red eye, and the broken cyberpunk remnants of civilization, now home to the Scavenger adversaries from which Cruises character must protect himself. More than once, I found myself looking at concepts I'd seen before, but never did I feel Oblivion failed to recreate these mainstays of the Sci-fi genre in its own way; rather, it did a brilliant job of making some of them its own.<br /><br />I enjoy Cruise in Sci-fi roles, there's something house-hold about him that keeps things relevant. He delivers a typical steadfast performance as the care taker of humanities remaining presence on earth, but he's bettered by Angela Riseborough's witty and emotional depiction of his bed sharing Communications Officer. Other notable names aside, it's a one man show with Cruise firmly at the helm, but whereas other movies may have been built for him, this one was not.<br /><br />In summary, Oblivion is a very well made and well paced movie, which manages to cover a wide portion of the Sci-fi genre, without copying it. It's a satisfying and beautifully shot film, with an unpredictably predictable end.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I have loaded this movie maybe 3 times, but it seems to time out and say \\"network down\\".  If it's too long to download in one go break it up into parts. I'm getting very frustrated that it never works!!!!  It just sits there saying\\" loading\\", but there is no blue line showing progress, then it says network is down. I chatted with customer service and they wanted me to re-register my device. I have no problems with anything else I've wanted to view so why would I do that? Just tried it yet again, same results.  They need to fix it.
B005BLYSQK|3.0|With the classical CD market having become such a buyer's market, especially with box sets, I recently bought this and Christian Zacharias's EMI France release to add to my collections of Brendel, Kempff, and Uchida.  I also have many single disc recordings of Schubert's sonatas and short pieces, including Lupu, Pollini, Kovacevich, Perahia etc.  Given the care Schiff clearly put into preparing himself for this undertaking, I really wanted to like this set.  I say all this as a preamble because, after many a listening, I think the only way anyone who loves Schubert's piano works would be satisfied with Schiff would be if his were the only set you owned, and/or if you wanted to have most (not all, where's the Wanderer Fantasy?)of Schubert's piano works in one place and for a decent price.<br /><br />All in all, I'm surprised that Decca decided to re-release these sonatas, since they are exceedingly bland and ordinary in terms of interpretation.  They've already released box sets of Brendel, Uchida and Lupu's Schubert, so why Schiff?  Schiff plays the Impromptus and other shorter pieces wonderfully, and he's fine with the early sonatas up to D. 664, but that's not why we buy complete sets of Schubert's sonatas and short pieces, is it?  It's also irritating that the early, pleasant but lightweight and often unfinished early Schubert is mixed in with the mature and complete sonatas.  To me the early works are interesting only in terms of what Schubert did later on.  It would have been better to have put them together on the first couple of discs and be done with them.  Life's too short to listen to works Schubert would probably have never allowed to have been published had he lived longer.<br /><br />Schiff's 960 would be perfectly acceptable if there weren't so many superior alternatives out there.  He does fine, but he's just not in Pollini, Kempff, Perahia or Brendel's league in conveying the mysterious aura of the piece. Elsewhere, especially with those substantial, wonderful, but slightly uneven sonatas, the 845, 850 and 894, he always seems to lose the narrative line, and there's no nuance or subtlety.  The same is true for me of 958 and 959.  I listen to them and all I feel is frustrated at all the missed opportunities.  If Uchida sometimes frustrates me because she over-reaches, Schiff never seems to risk anything.  Moments of true expressiveness where he momentarily seems to escape into rapturous celebration (present 100% in the Moments Musicaux and the Impromptus) are always interrupted by a return to some very pedestrian phrasing, and seem to fade into the inadequacy of the overall picture.  Also, his tendency to bang away on occasion is exacerbated by the big, thick-textured Bosendorfer sound.<br /><br />If you want one set of Schubert, go with Brendel.  Schiff's efforts just don't compare.  While I can see why some listeners have a negative reaction to Brendel's Beethoven, even though I admire his Beethoven hugely, Brendel has a natural, lyrical and unforced way with Schubert that I find miraculous.  The only fault I can find with the recent box set release of Brendel's 80s Schubert is that the D. 664 and D. 537, recorded circa 1982 and still available used here on Amazon, are omitted.wonderful, but slightly uneven sonatas, the 845, 850 and 894, he always seems to lose the narrative line, and there's no nuance or subtlety.

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Music is totally  Classic Jimi. Glad this music was found and shared. You will not be disappointed in this CD.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|Loads of fun, fast paced, great dialog with a talented cast. This did not disappoint: light entertainment with lots of intelligent laughs
B001VNB54A|5.0|As a war buff - kind of - I found the series extremely well done.  Blu-ray was nice and added quality to an already excellent film.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|First - it was a film worth watching, no doubt about this. However, l could not escape from the thought that having seen this - too long a first part of the new trilogy, knowing that we'll have two more....I am not quite sure wheather Peter Jackson's creativity will endure to meet my expectations of innovative story telling.<br /><br />Having said that this was a nice film to see I could not get away from the light taste of &#34;chewing over&#34; the same meal we had during the Lord of the ring trilogy, which was excellent of its kind.<br /><br />At this point I am a bit reluctant to be definitive about my recommendation, I guess that will have to wait for the next two parts of this trilogy before one gets a clear opinion.<br /><br />Rony Alalouf<br />Israel
B000GFLE1S|5.0|And, I'm going to spare myself from reading yet one more review that seems an attempt at scripwriting, and/or reveals the ending.  Enjoyed tremendously, and that it is based on a true story makes it all the better.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game is so much fun even my children love to play diamond dash is great<br />Gotta love it
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|This movie turned out to much more entertaining than I anticipated.  I found the directors over the top gore style with gun shots to be amusing and not overly gross.  I found it to be more of a comedy/drama.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I want to meet me a Christian Grey. Great book could not put it down. Can't wait for the next one .
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Trip Advisor is my go-to app for finding new restaurants, fun things to see and do, and where to stay when I go out of town. Reviews let you know what items are hot on a restaurant's  menu, and what items were a disappointment and why. Some thing that bothers another was not a problem at all for me, but I knew that beforehand because of the very specific reader reviews. Pictures are worth a thousand words and the pictures for where to stay speak volumes! Readers can even give hints about how to choose the best room, ie.rooms on higher floors have better views. I use it to see how well restaurants are doing before going out in my home town. This app is great!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|There were interesting sections but then I had to push myself through till I got to another interesting section.  I
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book deserves a five from me. It's so equally beautiful, sad, and has so much power and anger built upon it. It truly makes you want to run away and clear your mind.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I mean it's Brandon Sanderson. This is the guy who was able to finish the wheel of time series. Get the damn book already...
0452273331|5.0|Ayn Rand is a great author! This is a very inspiring book i could write a whole essay on it. I found it absorving i could hardly take my eyes of it until i finished it. Definitely recommended specially for future arquitects!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I love the movie my mother who I bought this for watches it all the time I thank you lots
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Excellent movie and very well made. I can see why the director of the movie received an Oscar award. The scenes with the tiger are phenomenal. This movie is a must-see.
0399226907|5.0|I just do not understand how this book is still popular.<br /><br />We get it! He's hungry! But nothing else happens. No arc. No character development. No plot twists. I could have written this underwater with a pen made of cheese. There is nothing to it! And yet, it feels endless when you read it.<br /><br />I don't know. Maybe I just have higher standards than 2 year-olds but it's time we expose this book as a fraud and a poor experience to anyone with an Ivy League degree like me. Even if it isn't one of the good Ivys, it's still Columbia and I won't have my student loans paid for at least another two decades.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Good Bond movie! Don't remember the movie anymore but the general impression is that it is a must see movie.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|thats all i really wanted to say.  this film is the worst.  if you like it, there is something very wrong with you.  this is a series of clichés that have no reason to be on screen.  would rather stab hot needles in my eyes...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first and decided to pick up the book. No surprise here the book details an engaging, fast paced story of a great trilogy

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is my first book by this author and I can't wait to read more of her work.  Stayed up until 3 a.m.to finish this last night.  I can count on 2 hands how often that happens. Loved her characters and were fully engrossed with them within the first few chapters.  The sexual tension between Sky and Holder was built up perfectly. The author included some surprises along the way that I didn't see coming which made it that much better.  This really is at the top of my list!
B00004D0C5|3.0|The movie was ok. Not good for children at all. The acting is ok. Not one of my favorite movies
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The customs  and The idioms of Newfoundland made the Shipping news a splendid read...and reread.  I am looking forward to a second reading of this book....knowing that I will enjoy the funny ways the rural Irish depicted in this book talk about life.  Living at my summer cottage and  traveling rural areas  in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland showed me that the Shipping News was a bit of an exaggeration,...BUT enough was true and the odd oral nuances are actually present as you leave the urban centers for back road travel.  This book has changed my summer travel investigations.  Can I find a trip to Ireland from Halifax?  I'm looking....
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really enjoy this game, i wouldn't say it's better than bejeweled but its up there! I give it five stars.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|The app is so wicked fun app!!! But at times it gets slow and does it by its self. Overall amazing
B009XY97VC|5.0|I am a \\"Game of Thrones\\" addict. I was looking for some new music and am a writer. I stumbled upon this one night. It was literally entering a new world and never wanting to come out of it. Each song is brilliantly created and has inspired new work for me to write. I am finally coming out of my own writers block. The rich detail evokes emotions well thought of in each song. This group is two steps ahead of it's competition as far as I am concerned. I have flat out raved to many on my own page about this group. I also have sent them to Amazon to check this particular album out. Close your eyes, shut the door and open your mind. Leave reality far behind. I ordered \\"Invincible\\" last night lol Achangel is not far behind. I dare any not to tell me \\"SkeyWorld\\" is not out of this world in a world and class all of it's own. Enjoy!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I loved this book.  So many things a President encounters and must deal with .  Things we have no clue about.  It is nice to see how all the Presidents have come to assist the current President- as only a few men know what is really behind this job.  I did not know so much of this about past Presidents.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a far, far better than most of the drivel that gets foisted on the public by established authors working for the big name publishers. I hope to read a great many more Hugh Howey stories in the future!
B003L77G6A|5.0|This is one of the funniest shows / series on television.  I love it and own all the seasons DVDs that are available.
B005CFWID0|4.0|Love the colors, and it is comfortable even after walking on hard floors all day.  I got lots of compliments on this shoe.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Started to watch arrow a couple of episodes into the season. This pilot helped us understand the story line. Amazon instant video is easy to use.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing album. I can't help but tap my feet to the wonderful music. Can listen to it over and over again.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A magnificent story of the camaraderie that exist among pilots regardless of political beliefs or boundaries. A true story sure to touch your heart. .
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is one of the few movies I would buy to own and view again and again. Most movies - even pretty good ones - if you've seen it, you've seen it. This is one of the rare ones where you'll see more each time you view it. Amazing, imaginative graphics. Incredible, seamless CGI effects. Great acting and storytelling. I read the book when it came out, but that in no way detracted from the cinema experience. Highly recommended.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I loved the old series, but in contrast to modern TV, the characters were thin and the plots overly simple.  This revives the old series, but with raises it to 21st century standards.  This &#34;reboot&#34; allows for a 2nd life for one for a grand old television series that changed how SF approached in video.
B000VIK8D0|4.0|I lke the Earp storyline and it's always interesting to see movie variations.  The Costner version was a little long but I wasn't surprised since Costner seems to like making long movies.  I like the fact that it showed Earp when he was young and what happened to him when his  wife died.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was difficult to put down....the  twists and turns and the chronological changes  aways kept me on the alert. While reading this book,set in the U.K.  one cannot fail to notice that mental heath care is being offered by the British health System, while right now  lack of mental health care and recognition is more of a hot-button topic in american life and politics.I think this book was well written and I have recommended it to all my reader friends.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|it takes for ever to load. like after it is finished it will say install and you push it and it will start all over agin .
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|As Viking-files this show is long over due. We only wish there were more than the token shield-maiden as it was not as rare as that for Viking women to also go raiding or to battle. Historically it reflects a decent sense of how Vikings may have lived. The story line has elements from some of the actual sagas or historical tales from the Viking era, which I thought was exceedingly clever. They even show All-Thing which was an important gathering in Viking times. The settings the show is filmed in can make you believe you are seeing pre-Christian Scandinavia. For once in a long while the history channel does something right.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|This is exactly why I don't buy any Disney Blu-ray's because I got tired of buying them twice first the Blu-ray then the 3d much l8r. As long as there is only these two options I will not purchase either. It's about time Disney stopped re-releasing then doing the 3-d, Greed pure and simple up to this point I've bought Up, G-force, Meet the Robinsons, Monsters Inc. and Bolt as well as others first in BD then 3-D here's food for thought once you alienate your consumers, like me I will no longer buy any of your product if you keep it up. We all love Disney but when taken to the cleaners that loyalty will be spent.
B006LSZECO|5.0|good story had a few surprises good writing<br />looking forward to reading other titles by this author<br />cant wait to start
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Dissapointing product considering that TWC should really have the resources to provide forecasts further out. I found that Accuweather's forecasting was much more usefully.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I'm having a hard time putting this book down - I'm reading it on my iPad, which seems appropriate - because it's so well-written, and because Mr. Jobs was such a larger than life character. I don't think I'd have particularly liked him in person, but I can't deny his gift for foresight and attention to detail, and his successes with consumer products are legion. He had a really interesting story, and Mr. Isaacson was able to talk to so many of his friends, family, peers, and employees that you do seem to get a very good sense of who Steve Jobs was and what he was all about.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|We are big fans of Bruce Willis. His performance was good, but the movie was a bit difficult to follow.  May if we watched it again it may be better?
B00519YRH2|5.0|Great movie, and a wonderful adaptation. I love this kind of thing, and Tom Hanks is amazing! This was an amazing movie that is captivating all the way through...look how far he's come from then! This is one of my all-time favorites, and a definite family show. \\"Big\\" tells a story about love, sadness, and responsibility. Love the plot. Love the story. ENJOY!

Never watch TV because the commercials are out of control, so I check out the library for seasons of shows. Borrowed BSG Razor from the library and DANG! Decided to buy the series for uninterrupted COMMERCIAL FREE entertainment.<br /><br />Good series. Wasn't for the big/cheap flimsy box, I would rate as 5-star. Should be a cheap/ flimsy metallic box instead, think about it: Cylon - metallic... ... ...
B000N2HBSO|4.0|After seeing the movie about Abraham Lincoln, which was based on the Dorothy Kearns Goodwin biography by the same title, LINCOLN, TEAM OF RIVALS, I was interested to read the whole story. The movie told only a part of it. Ms. Goodwin did an extraordinary amount of research to accomplish her amazing in-depth account of America's arguably best president ever elected - not once, but two times.<br />As a historian, she surely rates among the top.<br /><br />But here's the rub: it is too long. There is, in my opinion, too much information, much of it - deservedly or not - biased in favor of her subject. None of us now living has had the honor of meeting the great man. But surely he was not perfect! Nevertheless, I came away from this important tome almost convinced of his perfection. Ms. Kearns Goodwin tries to assure us that, yes, Mr. Lincoln was human. But somehow this reader remains skeptical. Having said this, I did like the book very much and learned a great deal from it, parficularly about the continuing struggle for freedom in which we have all been involved, to this day.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Was recommended this by a &#34;friend&#34;.  She loved it.  Wasn't her fault.  She just didn't realize that I have no interest in reading about porn in a book.  Also, it seemed quite corny.  While, I would surmise that in some circles, the whole signing of the dominatrix contract may have some appeal, it doesnt in mine.  I hope a movie doesnt come out with it, although if it does, crazy as it would sound, I think Lindsay Lohan would be FABULOUS as Anastasia.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|when my kindle fire quit charging at 3 months I thought it was gone forever as I was using a new charger I bought for it. I talked to customer service about the fire and he suggest he send me this charger at no charge as it was supposed to fix an engineering problem previously known to them. I didn't think it would work but agreed anyway. I got this charger ad used it immediately,. it charged quickly and my kindle fire was ready to go and has been fine ever since. I read a book a day so its very important to me to have kindle working all the time. thanks to amazon and the customer service people I feel I will have that just fine from now on and I can trust them to find the answer to the problem promptly and easily..

B004SKIPXW|5.0|If you don't absolutely love this movie, then you are probably into doll or stamp collecting. Just insanely outrageously over the top fun and well done action flick. This is the gold standard.
B004MPESSY|5.0|I will eventually get this flick for my video collection. Finally, a remake better than the original which is rare these days. I hate watching rapes scenes and had to skip pass a few minutes but to wait and see what she had dug up for these five as------ was a pure delight and better then the woman in the original. Hell have no fury like a woman scorned, but hell knew not to mess with this chick because she was absolutely no joke when it came to getting justice. *recommended*
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Hello!<br />I been looking for this item for a long time.<br />I was reading others reviews and some people said doesn't work. So, I try and work great, I guess they were talking a bout a generic, but bottom line this item work great.
B00BESM14U|5.0|We loved the acting, heart and humor in this one! Even though it is about tenagers, it is not just a &#34;for teenagers&#34; movie.

B008K6HN8I|3.0|This file manager is easy to use and helpful in locating documents, books, music, photos, etc.  I found it especially useful in finding personal documents sent to my Kindle. Before installing ES, I had trouble finding them.  I recommend this to everyone as a way to keep your files organized.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Old school hack and slash for the kindle. Good graphics and sound. Controls are easy to get used to. Play it now.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Read the book years ago so it was rewarding to see it in excellent movie form The story is quite compelling regardless of how you choose to interpret it Special effects were quite phenomenal
B009K916ZK|5.0|I'm glad I paid the extra money for the real thing, the Apple product, because I just used this in Southeast Asia and couldn't take the chance on malfunctioning.  With it, I showed all my Powerpoints.  Without it, I would have been back to flip charts!  What more can I say.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I could not put the book down.  I told all my reader friends to read the book and tell all their friends.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book has a lot of things happening in it! It's amazing that it is all in one book. No wonder they made two movies out of it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Love Love it is so cool I a play it all the time and for you people here are some seeds .scary. porsch. and 0.4.0
B005LAIGTG|4.0|I really liked this movie and the story was great and so was the acting.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Okay,  so here's. the deal. This game was too much fun to stop playing and give the review until I finished! It runs,  smoothe,  has good graphics and had a story line that keeps you from putting the game down . Great game for a great price!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|The listed price is what I have seen this advertised for in stores.  Usually 100 to 150 USD.  When I found this watch for less than 60 USD I bought it.  I have not been disappointed.  The day dial is bilingual, Spanish and English. Very easy setup.  A little small for my taste, but I bought this as my day to day watch when I am working.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />While amazon has this listed as a 30ft watch it is not.  The instruction manual says how to tell.  If it just has Water Resistant it is fine in the rain, but DO NOT GO SWIMMING or SHOWERING with it.  If it says Water Resistant 3ATM or 10 ATM then you are OK.
B007MCTTHY|3.0|Got bored with it and stopped playing after a day or so. Might be good for others, but not for me.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This movie had a great story and very visually appealing. Perhaps it was drawn out longer than it needed at over two hours. The acting and dialogue were exceptional as well.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|What an adorable movie! Perfect for a mom and daughter evening. A movie we could watch over and over. Don't just rent this one, buy it! :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it. Friggen loved it-- Seeing the character growth from Season 1 to 3-- it feels so organic- like it's just what you can expect in a world such as this one. It's hard to find gems like these where the writing and directing is so good. Everything about the series is, in my opinion, easy to relate too, so much so, I wonder how I would fare in a world like this.<br /><br />Cant wait to see next season :)
B00AB7HESI|5.0|ive searched for this game forever finally it came out for kindle i just hope that the game will load
B00899DV6O|5.0|Sounds really grown up in this record!!! Has changed it up a bit but not enough to lose his identity.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game. It also has great grafics. I habe never played a bad temple run.Get it!!!
B001OG3VOQ|5.0|Yes i do believe my statement but anyways!!! Alanis has an amazing voice AND really great at playing harmonica!! Did i mention she plays guitar too!! Awesome album.
B0022Q8CSC|4.0|Having watched the movie first I expected it to be better and was not disapointed. Great characters that are believable.
B00BDRJ3Z2|5.0|If your happy spring has finally showed its face, then you need this album to celebrate. If your just a big Luke Bryan fan like me you'll get it regardless!!! Ha ha
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great idea for going on a long hike, if you are out shooting out door photography. Not so much if you are working with clients such as weddings, family photos shoots etc.  You want something that is easy access and quick because you do not want a storage bag that will take extra time during precious moments.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy this game very much! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because 1) as the game goes on its harder to get gems  2) Everything in the store is super expensive and  3) Energy runs out quicker th a n expected. Besides these super minor things, the game is amazing and addictive :)
B000002P2V|5.0|Love the record. Big Who fan of earlier stuff, finally picked up this one, the last with Moon. Good remastered CD sound quality, especially considering it was done quite a few years ago now. Underrated in Who catalogue, IMO. &#34;Trick of the Light&#34; has a fantastic riff, and &#34;905&#34; and &#34;Music Must Change&#34; are up there with best tunes that the band ever did. Whole record is solid, really. Nice extras, especially the expanded &#34;Who Are You&#34; with the added verse.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I think that it is awesome but I think it needs a updates Don't you people out there that it needs a update other than that it's a great game.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Perfect for hiking and camping.  Was able to bring back a 18 year old beat up buck knife to an almost razors edge in a few minutes.  Only needed a few more minutes of stropping before the blade was able to shave my arm.  Not sure about longevity, but it took my worst knife and performed as advertised.
B009GX6TQ6|5.0|It must be hard to keep 2 NCIS shows going and they do a great job making this show different yet the same line of work.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Not a book I will remember. Felt short-changed with the final showdown. Main character (Bosch) felt more cardboard than real. Felt like author was just quickly going through the paces to be done with it and didn't have his heart into it.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I know I am reading these books out of order but it doesn't seem to matter. I enjoyed learning how Dog came into Walter's life. I recommend this book to fellow readers.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I was very surprised at how good this movie was. It had a good story line and the characters are interesting. I'd say it's fun for adults and kids alike. :)
B000IDEQTK|5.0|it was a very heart felt movie,that really happens in true life.I loved the clothing and the mentallity of the movie
B0019N8P2W|5.0|This has to be one of the best shows of the late 90s. It was really great to find the entire series on DVD, which includes the made for TV movies.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Don't wait to read this book.  It is a page turner.  My whole family has read it and we have fun talking about it.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|This was a great, action-packed movie. The plot is really interesting and it has a twist at the end! It's definitely worth watching/buying.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This helps to keep up with the tv show.  This is such escape and fantasy.  I just love this book.

1449410243|5.0|Funny, irreverent, and full of unique humor this comic style collection of humorous panels delivers Mr. Inman's popular style of web comic.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If you still have not seen Game of Thrones.  Give in and start now. It is so good.  Such drama.  Such Characters.
B000FA675C|5.0|Not only did this book grab me at the start, I learned a lot while reading it!  That is what is so great about Dan Brown's books, their not only entertaining and hold your interest, but their educational as well!  His books also make me want to visit the places their set in so I can see the sites first hand!  He is truly a gifted author!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This helps to keep up with the tv show.  This is such escape and fantasy.  I just love this book.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|This helps to keep up with the tv show.  This is such escape and fantasy.  I just love this book.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I enjoy true crime stories, and once this novel got into the flow (near the end), the pace was noticeably quicker and definitely more interesting.  I was very interested in most of the Day family lives, and the author did a good job n portraying the struggles this family had in dealing with life and normality.  i did not doubt for one moment, Ben's innocence - both of the murders as well as the molestation charges.  But I did find the lackadaisical attitude and living style of Libby a bit flat, if not unbelievable - but given the tragedy, perhaps this how some lives may be impacted and actions result.  The mother's choice of how to save her family seemed a bit out of context, as if &#34;thrown in&#34;, in order to explain the murders for the readers, without much background or history to support it.  Pay attention to the descriptions - this helps to tie people and events together.  The author does have a penchant for imagery - The cow scene was a bit too gruesome, but may be reflective of real-world occurrences in devil worship.  The scenes when Libby visited Runner or when she visited Diondra and Crystal were pretty well-done - I wanted to get out of there quickly too!  Overall, not a bad read, the flow sometimes broken between today and yesteryears.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Much more depth but the tv show makes it so much easier to read the books.  Going to have to read the series.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Wonderful book for anyone interested in Asian narratives, Zen Buddhism, the intersection of science and faith, or meditations on time and death.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|He loved this as a Christmas gift.  So nice to give somethig that is appreciated and used.  I do not play.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I must Admit i'm a bit confused ,generally when one writes a review of a product,it is available,this product is not available yet,<br /> of course i'm speaking about the Dvd,Bluray,Bluray 3d/digital copy release of the film \\"Oz the  Great and Powerful\\" [ available for  pre-order, as of this date 04/14/2013]  This Disc[s] are not yet out for the public, yet there seems to be a debate surrounding their format.  I must throw my hat in the ring as well, i believe Disney is charging a seperate fee for the 3d film because some people are buying the Blu-Ray 3d 4 disc packs so they can sell the Blu-ray 3d disc on ebay.  I believe, many people want to buy and  have the 3d  combo packs  because \\"Someday\\" they plan on watching the film in 3d [ i know i am] but as of right now 3d technology is too expensive for the normal family with kids  [i know`i can't afford it] yet we all \\"Hope\\" for the day when 3d technology is readily available [when it is those people who sold their discs will be sorry . Lol!] But for Disney to treat their Loyal Customers in such a way is Unforgivable![Who's ever idea this was should be fired!]  Charging for the same movie TWICE!  \\"You Stingy Sons of Beyotches! for years i have bought your dvd's not only for myself ,but for friends and family [ gifts , etc] To say i'm disapppointed with your decision to \\"DOUBLE\\" charge us for the same movie, words cannot express how angry i am with you.  I really,Really,REALLY wanted to buy this film, BUT I AM NOT!  I know this is hard for other people, but i urge you not to buy this film either.  WAIT UNTIL CHRISTMAS .  When Disney sees how many un-sold copies of the 3d version there are, more than likely they will realize their mistake and bundle the Blu-Ray /Dvd copy and the 3d copy together.  On a seperate note ,buyers, when you look at Amazon's  \\"Reviews\\" Bar Graft take a close look at the reviews, many of the 5 star reviews are for the Movie itself not for the product Amazon is selling,don't be fooled!  \\"Oblivion\\" the New Tom Cruise movie is not out yet,type it in ....HOW CAN THERE BE<br />A REVIEW OF THE DVD IF THE DVD IS NOT RELEASED YET ...NAY THE MOVIE IS NOT RELEASED IN THEATERS YET.  Just food for thought.  LA.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Streaming from Amazon is slower than from Netflix but we still enjoyed this very much.  I just have to order one day and watch the next. And I am connected with an ethernet cable to the Cable modum.  Still slow.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love playing this game. Whenever I get a free moment I check to see if I have built up more lives so I can play again. My only complaint is that the only way to get additional lives is to wait for time to pass or pay for them. I would like it better if you could earn them for scoring well.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Makes me want to drop cable and just get the good stuff off DVD and streaming.  Amazon is a great source for this type of tv.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|At first I couldn't decide if I liked this book. It kept changing characters every chapter and I would just start to get interested in one of them and it would switch to another. They are all interrelated and each have some compelling experiences. If you like short stories or want to find an author who's pushing the limits of creativity, I recommend this book. She is amazing at writing dialogue and recapturing time periods--like the 70's, 80's, etc.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This was so great.  So glad that I paid and got to watch the whole season before Season 3 started.
B000Q7B8FS|5.0|Loved watching this with my 10 year old, I had always loved these movies and now it's great to share them with him!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think you should buy this game!  It is awesome! I know it is a lot of money but this game is really good.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|well written, taut drama that never lets you know what really happened for sure. Wish it hadn't ended when it did, would like to see how the couple navigated the aftermath of the &#34;accident&#34;
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Good suspense. Now they want eighteen more words. I am not good at writing reviews. I would/will read the next book if there is a continuation.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|This is ok for a rental to watch at home. I watched it with my son and husband and we were getting bored sometimes. There are a lot of predictable moments and not many surprises. Daniel Craig looked old and tired. I guess I only liked Adele's song form the whole movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome I love this app I play it non stop get this app its really fun I love the horses.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A must see! Great for a family movie night. This is a story that makes you think. Beautiful ocean scenes.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Como muchos de los libros de Ken Follet, una brillante investigación y síntesis históricas combinadas con una novelizacion de fácil lectura.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Calming and relaxing nice way to pass time . Good little brain teaser as well . A a a a a a .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is really good like to play on it and have fun for the most part. I like how you can play feed jump the horse
B002VRZEYM|5.0|If you have ever wondered about where your food comes and what is done with it to get it to your table, you should watch this movie.  However, if you are dead set on not changing your eating habits, be prepared to change your mind.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|I never go it on my kindle. How would I know if it even work s. Please, please,please, send it now
B00992CF6W|1.0|I honestly have nothing good to say about this app besides the fact that it rarely crashes it is so worthless compared to the Pc and Xbox version. If you really want to play minecraft save your money and buy the Pc or Xbox versions, they're both a million times better than this.
0385349947|4.0|This book is a true eye-opener! I found this book to be empowering and enlightening. Everyone should read this book
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|All the Hobbit books are excellent. J.R.R. Tokien was an excellent author. I am glad these books are out there.<br />After all so many believe these times existed. I know I do.  Excellent reading!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series is such a refreshing pleasure compared to the barage of violent graphic  or nonsense reality shows available on mainstream television.  I am not opposed to good drama representing some of the darker elements of life but I have appreciated this lighter drama of life and its termoils for giving me a breather and reminding me that life is to be enjoyed, celebrated. The acting is lovely.  It is a pleasure to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You need to read this it amazing oh I wish there was more I highly recommend it to any one looking for a romantic thriller....WITH LOTS OF YUMMY GORE
B003E6LC6I|5.0|I couldn't wait to start season 2 after season one got me hooked on these characters. Their relationships continue to build and intertwine....some get meaner and some get bulldozed. The acting is superb. I can't put it down...just like a good book!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|YouTube doesn't work on my android tablet. Although I like watching Smosh and Pewdiepie etc. this works great for music videos! I love to watch the videos because they have really good quality.
B00190N4E4|5.0|\\"No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man\\" This is how the film \\"Gandhi\\" opens. I sat down to watch the film with one thing on my mind, the dread of enduring three hours, eleven minutes and fourteen seconds of what I thought would be an ordeal, however, this film turned out to be an experience I will treasure and share with others in my life. This 1982 Richard Attenborough film portrays the life of Mohandas K. Ghandi, the Indian lawyer who led India to independence. The film depicts Ghandi's non-violent, non-cooperative protest against the oppressions of British rule and how his approach changed the face of a nation; it is the story of how India became the `heart' of the man we call Ghandi.<br />\\"Ghandi\\" is epic in every sense of the word. Richard Attenborough created a film where everything from the screenplay to the acting, direction and cinematography were beyond impressive. The dialogue of the movie was well written, delivered by a cast which included Ben Kingsley in the lead role as Ghandi. His collaborators in the freedom movement were played by Saeed Jaffrey (Sardar Patel), Roshan Seth (Pandit Nehru), and Alyque Padamsee (Mohammed Ali Jinnah ). Actors Athol Fugard (General Smuts) and John Gielgud (Lord Irwin) were cast as two of Ghandi's opponents in India's flight to justice. Ian Charleson plays Charlie Andrews, a cleric who is a close friend and confidante of Ghandi's throughout his years of protest and unto death. Every actor portrayed their character believably, imparting the spirit of the time. They each captured the passion of their characters whether for or against an independent India.<br />Ghandi was a young, British raised and educated Gujarati Indian who made a trip to India on legal business, on this trip Ghandi experiences the discrimination and harshness that is the British rule over India, when he is told he cannot sit in the first class section of a train on which he'd paid for a first class ticket and because of his race, was not to be accommodated. Until this time, discrimination was something he had not known or experienced. The incidence is pivotal, it changes his life.<br /> I don't think any actor other than Ben Kingsley, could have portrayed Ghandi with the love and painstaking commitment he gave to this character. He truly captured the essence of Ghandi. In one simply stated line, he says \\"An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind\\" in this he personifies Ghandi's mantra for peace and non-violence. In the simplistic way Kingsley portrays Ghandi in everything from his softly spoken words, to the care he took to mimic Ghandi's most miniscule mannerisms; his movements, making sure to perfect his own Gujarati dialect, and totally transforming his body to exhibit the frail Ghandi on a hunger strike for peace and unity, he became Ghandi. Through Kingsley's depiction of Ghandi we see a country under tyranny led to its independence, we see India, the heart of Ghandi.<br /> India is beautifully visualized through the cinematography in this film. As Ghandi travels by train to learn more about the condition of life in India, he falls in love with both the land and the people; they become the very heart of him. The poverty and oppression are captured through the detailed cinematography; the feelings of hunger and suffering are felt through the multitudes of people shown who are hungry for food, and hungrier for change. The film is able to capture the substance of a nation in turmoil, and extract every level of emotion out of the viewer. In the end the audience is left with a sense of achievement and loss, elation and sorrow, a beginning and an ending.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Two people blinded by the pain of previous relationships are slow to recognize that the passion they share is only as intense as it is because love has been added to the equation.
0812550706|4.0|Here is a tricky review for me. It's sort of bittersweet. Let me explain....<br /><br />I have heard of this book for YEARS (and no wonder since it was written before I was born...1977) by way of recommendation, Amazon.com's \\"you might like\\", magazines, reviews, friends, etc. So of course the hype was huge. I merely went to B&N to browse books as usual and found this for the first time since I've never seen it on the shelves. For 6$ it was a bargain and It's reputation was solid. Good $ and a good cover as always draw me in as well.<br /><br />The book starts out, as all do, with intros, back-stories, and trying to introduce the key characters VERY early (or so I thought). We meet Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggins, his sister Valentine, and brother Peter just to start. The dynamic right of the bat of these 3 is incredibly mature, scary, and a tad bit psychotic even. Not what you would expect from three children who are all under the age of 10... lol.  All of the trials and tribulations Ender faces are with kids his age, except everyone is a genius who will make you feel stupid at times. -_-<br /><br />Through the first two chapters you discover the setting and course the book will take, but not completely described. This in particular I LOVED because being written in the first, and sometimes second person, one really doesn't get a direct explanation like almost every book written in third.<br /><br />If felt a little like slow read sometimes but it really wasn't. Ender deals with personal and \\"professional\\" issues that make him literally start to go crazy and moves the book along nicely but subtly. The vocabulary, situations, and abuse in the battle school make you CONSTANTLY forget your reading about children!!! It's a unique experience I haven't had in any story I've read EVER!<br /><br />The ending was my favorite part by far!! The angles and confusion the author takes during the last chapters differ from the book almost entirely! For you out of the box thinkers (like me ;P), you will realize what's happening almost instantly, but it will still leave your jaw dropped!! I thoroughly enjoyed the way it ended and how the characters' stories don't end. Leaves you hangin a bit.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a solid book I would read between another series you might be waiting for or just to take a break from another story. I really liked it, but the spark of love just wasn't there for me. You can probably tell from the feel of my review...... hehehehe), you will realize what's happening almost instantly, but it will still leave your jaw dropped!! I thoroughly enjoyed the way it ended and how the characters' stories don't end. Leaves you hangin a bit.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a solid book I would read between another series you might be waiting for or just to take a break from another story.

B0041D843M|5.0|A Great book, more people need to be aware of this book and how beneficial and life changing it is
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|If your married or have a normal imperfect life you will probably enjoy some if not all of the film.
B0035OC7OU|4.0|Great perspective of the busiest bloke on the disc and the timeline's reluctance to bend.  Love story was a bit too logical though.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|As a Bond fan since the 60's, I am amazed to say that this film is one of ( or the) best of all--it can stand on its own.
B00563M11M|5.0|How did I get here? Anyway, I'll call it as I see it. I have the most trustworthy by my side. The risks are significant but we will walk this straight.<br /><br />Terry does great heroes.
B003OUXECE|5.0|Set in the time when Rapture was built until the time just before the arrival of Jack the protagonist from the first videogame, the story centeres around Bill McDounagh, Andrew Ryan's chief plumber. This book explains how plasmids came to be in Rapture, and how Frank Fontaine rose to power. It covers the Rapture Civil War, and how terrifying it was to be in Rapture as unrestricted plasmid use destroyed the people. If you liked the first two games and were interested in the detailed story within the games, you will love this fast paced book.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|So glad to have this DVD as we loved the movie. We were thrilled to get it &#34;early&#34; as a pre-order, the day before it came out in the store. Have already watched twice again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the surpises and relationships.  Great series.  A drama based on relationships of people you grow to care about.  You get involved in their struggles and cheer them on.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Fantastic.  Suspense, intrigue, fast moving excellent story line with each sentence moving you to rush to the next.  This is one hard book to put down.  Probably one of the best of Connellys books.  If available I would rate it a ten star!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love walking dead.  Love the relationships and their growth and struggles.  The writers continue to surprise - you never know who will die next, regardless of how important they are - keeps it intersting.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I loved LOTRs trilogy.  I can watch them over and over.  I play Baldur's Gate as I grew up.  The Hobbit was ok.  However, to be fair, it was a disappointment compared to LOTRs trilogy.  If you having seen LOTRs yet, then yes, watch The Hobbit, and you'll be satisfied. After watching The Hobbit, watch LOTRs trilogy, and you'll be wow'd.  Here are the reasons I found The Hobbit was a disappointment:<br /><br />-The beginning was slow, and attempted some humor pieces, which failed.<br />-The beginning took up a lot of time, yet there you could have skipped 95% of it, and didn't miss out on the movie.<br />-In LOTRs trilogy, I remembered ALL the character names.  In The Hobbit, the only new names I remembered was Thorin and Azog!  You know it's bad when the characters are not memorable.<br />-Some of the fighting scenes were stupid unrealistic.  At least in LOTRs, the fighting seemed more believable.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Whats the hype? Two very young and talented guitarist that both sing shoe gazing trip hop. No not new but done very well. Very interesting combination of trip hop and early New Order electronic music. Doesn't grab the listener but if you are a causal music fan this might not be for you. If you are a music addict and looking for something that is better than-whats cool right now this is it. Hey that is what you tube is for try it and than decide.
B00006I53S|4.0|The EF 28-135 3.5-5.6 IS USM, introduced in 1997, was an impressive engineering feat in its day: wide zoom range, silent and fast AF and Image Stabilization (IS). IS was the new tech on the block, and the 28-135 was the first normal range zoom to feature this technology. Nevertheless, this early IS implementation--amazing back in the day--is showing its age 15 years out. Newer designs feature panning mode and another stop or more of effective IS.<br /><br />It's a beefy zoom, tipping the scales at 540 g (18.9 oz). The twist zoom action is smooth but loose and prone to creep when pointed down. And it gets looser with age. After 10 years of extensive use mine was loose as a goose! Zooming is accomplished by expanding and contracting the nested barrels. Like most AF lenses, the manual focus ring is small and not as silky as the manual lenses of yesteryear. The nested three-barrel design has lots of cracks to suck in dust. All lenses that expand and contract during zooming are subject to this problem. However, I have more particles on the inside of this lens than any zoom I have owned. However, neither dust or loose zoom seemed to impact image quality one iota.<br /><br />It sports a ring-type USM (Ultrasonic Motor) that drives an internal lens group and, thus, AF rips. The front element does not rotate and the barrel does not expand or contract during focusing. However, the barrel extends considerably when zooming to 135 mm. Of course, being an USM lens, it is silent when focusing. It has FTM, allowing you to manually focus without switching out of AF mode. If you prefocus manually, the distance window in meters and feet is useful.<br /><br />The filter size is 72 mm, making filters expensive. The instructions state that you cannot use a polarizing filter with a lens hood. However, it's easy to rotate the filter through the petal cutouts of the lens hood. Oh yeah, that hood is an optional accessory.<br /><br />OPTICAL QUALITY: For a consumer zoom, it is sharp and contrasty, slightly sharper than my EF 28-105 3.5-4.5 USM. Although quality is decent wide open, the best image quality is from 28-50mm at F8. It is a little softer at the long end. It suffers from a small amount of barrel distortion at the wide end and pincushion distortion at the long end. However, I haven't noticed much distortion except in macro mode, where barrel distortion at 28 mm is slightly more pronounced. Image quality is good enough for excellent 11 x 14 or 12 x 18 inch enlargements.<br /><br />In terms of flare and ghosting, this is the weakest of Canon's zooms. In other words, flare and ghosting will probably occur if you shoot bright sunsets or other strong light sources. I keep the lens shade on to help keep flare in check.<br /><br />IMAGE STABILIZATION: This would be a nice lens without Image Stabilization (IS). However, IS really sets the performance and use of this lens apart from previous zooms. Small gyro sensors coupled to a CPU detect the degree and direction of camera shake and counteract this vibration by moving a compensating optical group. Subsequently, I almost always get a sharp picture, even two or three stops below my normal hand held shutter speed.<br /><br />IS changed the way I take pictures. I used to put away my camera when conditions got dark and murky, now I keep on shooting (I avoid flash except for fill). However, IS is not just for low light conditions, it helps eminently in any high vibration situation such as shooting in high wind, airplanes, automobiles or boats. Heck, I've shot one-handed while hanging off a cable car in San Francisco and nailed a sharp picture. For years this was my favorite ready-for-anything travel lens.<br /><br />The instructions recommend turning IS off when using a tripod as the lack of movement may cause IS to be erratic. However, IS is extremely useful in conjunction with a tripod as long as there is some vibration. For example, when windy, I use Image Stabilization with a tripod mounted camera and it makes a major improvement in sharpness.<br /><br />EXIT BLURB: If you can't afford the EF 24-105 4L IS USM, this is the next best thing and a nice lens for film and full-frame DSLRs such as the 6D or 5D MKII. With a 28 mm short end, it's not wide enough as a normal zoom for APS-C cameras such as the 60D or 7D. Why? The 1.6x cropping factor of these cameras yield an approximate 45-200 35mm equivalent zoom range. I find it odd that Canon used this as a kit lens for the XXD series. However, if you prefer a normal to medium telephoto range on a small frame digital, this may be the lens for you.t makes a major improvement in sharpness.<br /><br />EXIT BLURB: If you can't afford the EF 24-105 4L IS USM, this is the next best thing and a nice lens for film and full-frame DSLRs such as the 6D or 5D MKII.

B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This was nothing like I expected but I hadn't seen a preview either.  My niece and nephew stayed over and we were looking for a movie.  They saw it and said it was supposed to be good.  We had a great time watching it.  There is some adult humor in it and it has a great plot.  I can tell it would have been good in 3D as well.

B005LAIII0|5.0|This movie has a lot of good things going for it.<br />1.  The scenery, animation, CGI, etc... is very cool and beautifully done.  One of my favorite visual scenes of the movie, is when PI, sees the ship going down underwater.  It's so unique and well done it just stayed with me through the whole movie.<br /><br />2.  The Actors who play PI:  First the younger 16 year old PI, played by Suraj Sharma, does an excellent job, and has just the right amount of humor in his voice to make me really like him.  Second, the older PI, played by Suraj Sharma, is a master storyteller, that sucked me in from the beginning.<br /><br />3.  the story:  it is unique, which today is rare indeed that you would have an original idea.  The ending completely surprised me, and made me love the movie even more.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this movie
B005V2S7FW|4.0|1. Last pass for the PC is free and highly useful in the browser.<br />2. The configuration for the tablets and phones are a pay per year of $12.00.  I find this a little steep for the less functionality provided. You can try it for 14 days and decide for yourself.<br />3. I love the PC version but the Android version leaves something lacking.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I have absorbed, devoured, and contemplated this book for months. I've read and reread it to the point of losing sleep. None other has stayed with me so long that I find I must read it again. I recommend the Night Circus to anyone who needs or desires a flight to another indescribable, intoxicating world.

B00C1BUYX4|5.0|This movie is history brought to life.  Daniel Day-Lewis is outstanding as Lincoln and the make-up job certainly made him appear like the Lincoln I've seen from photos.  Sally Field was a very convincing Mary Todd Lincoln as well.  If you enjoy history, then this is the movie to watch.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Contrasting the husbands activities with the diary entries of his wife moved the story line along very well and captured my attention. The resolution of the wife's disappearance still kept the book lively. I only was disappointed in the authors resolution of their conflict.  But maybe that lets story continue into another book.
B005FISBTO|3.0|This season was ok, but not as exciting and shocking as season seven!  Cannot wait to see what is coming this summer.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I was very excited to read this book but it fell short for me. I was expecting so much more from this. You do learn some about Tina's childhood but a large portion of this book is given to SNL and 30 Rock. And honestly I didn't think all that funny. Don't get me wrong,  this book does have several places that you just have to laugh out loud at just not enough.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you are and introvert, extrovert, or somewhere in between, this book is an invaluable resource. Helped this introvert find the answers to a lot of questions.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|\\"You want to save your wife by doing what I do? This is what I do, I kill people and sell their corpses for cash.\\" Django (Foxx) is a slave being moved to a new plantation when dentist/bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz finds him and frees him needing his help on a bounty. After getting to know each other they strike up a deal, work together for the winter making enough money so they can buy and free Django's wife from her owner. I will start by saying that I have thought Tarantino's movies are good but I am not a huge fan. Unlike most I think Reservoir Dogs is his best, not Pulp Fiction but overall I think he is a little overrated. I was looking forward to seeing this one mainly because of Jamie Foxx. About halfway in I started to change my opinion. This is far and away Tarantino's best movie. The writing is fantastic and the style is defiantly him with a few cringe worthy moments but this is a movie that I really enjoyed and I highly recommend. Foxx is great in this and DiCaprio plays such a good bad guy that he should get more roles like this. The only bad thing I have to say about this is that it is a little long, but it does hold your attention for the most part and this is one of the best movies of the year. Overall, Tarantino's best movie and I highly recommend this...if you can handle it. I give it an A-.
B003XRELEI|4.0|I love his style and the way the words flow of the page. I have no choice but to devour them. The book and story is obviously sick and the product of a demented mind, so I am definitely getting another one from Vonnegut.

B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and was surprised to find it on Amazon Prime for no cost.  Jennifer Lawrence is great and deserves all the accolades she has received. I was in suspense and enthralled until near the end when it got a little unreal when the overseers of the games introduced the computer generated dogs which somehow became real, and when the game participants started running in gangs.<br /><br />The plot line itself is not new and has been a staple in scifi films, like Schwartzeneggers \\"Running Man\\", various Jean Claude VanDamme movies, and others.<br /><br />Overall this movie was enjoyable and I recommend it.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great game.  Interesting puzzles that are different than some games of this type.  Very spooky atmosphere.  It is great to relax to,  Not too hard and not too easy.  Final words......luv it, keep those great games coming G5.  Plus ,  I really like getting to try the game before you purchase it.  If u don't like it u just don't buy it.:-) :-)

I have tested some of the techniques in this book and have to say, I do feel less stressed, happier and general and able to change negative thought patterns or reduce their air time in my head quite significantly.<br />I'm impressed with this book, my approach to lots in my life did not appear to be working. I read this book and I feel things are moving again. Read, keep an opening and believe. You WILL be pleasantly surprised.

B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Recording studios that are famous among non-musicians or anyone who isn't a serious music aficionado can be counted on one hand. There's Abbey Road in London, Sun Studio in Memphis, possibly Capitol Studios in Hollywood or The Hit Factory or Electric Lady in New York. Dave Grohl's eulogy for Sound City will undoubtedly make it as famous as some of the others, albeit a bit too late to save it. The first half of Sound city tells the story of the studio and how it became the choice of artists as diverse as Barry Mannilow, Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Rage Against the Machine, REO Speedwagon and of course, Nirvana.  Along the way, we learn how the studio became instrumental in the merger of Fleetwood Mac and Buckingham Nicks, and how an almost accidental combination of the room and a custom made Neve console gave Sound City a unique drum sound. There is also unseen home video of the recording of Tom Petty's Damn the Torpedoes and Nirvana's Nevermind.<br /><br />As much as being a history of the studio, Sound City is also a celebration of the old ways of recording music.  While there may be a certain irony in ageing punks like Grohl, Josh Homme and Corey Taylor saying the young kids of today don't get it, they do have a point. Prior to computerised recording, the studio and its equipment were an integral part of a recording's sound. The once unique characteristics of legendary studios and gear have all been digitally modelled now and are available on the device you're looking at right now. It hasn't made recordings better though. As digital defender Trent Reznor points out in the film, there are people who have never used the real versions of the equipment they have digitally emulated on their computers and therefore, don't really know what they're for or how to use them.<br /><br />The second half of the film shows the relocation of the classic console to Grohl's studio and the making of the [[ASIN:B00APKIN1I Sound City: Real To Reel]] album with a range of oldfriends and Sound City alumni. Of all the participants, Paul McCartney comes across as a bit of a ring-in since he never recorded at Sound City like all the others.  However, as Grohl says, he's recording on the console that gave him the life he has with one of the people who made him want to make music in the first place. You can't ask for much more than that.<br /><br />In every way, Sound City is a beautiful, fond and humourous documentary which should educate and entertain both musical obsessives and more casual fans alike.<br /><br />There are three bonus programs, each focussing on the recording of a song for the album. They are all presented in multi-angle, fly-on-the-wall style and provide a fascinating insight into the recording process.<br /><br />Feature:  * * * * *<br />Extras:  * * * * *<br />Audio:  LPCM Stereo, Dolby 5.
