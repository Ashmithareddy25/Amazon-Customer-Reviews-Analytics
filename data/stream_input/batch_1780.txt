B004MYF4SS|5.0|Loved this book.  It transports you to another world, and another time.  Not just the main character's childhood, but your own.  Beautifully drawn characters, interesting and intricate plot.  I have now added Peter May to my list of authors - I will be reading them all!

B0079R8KXG|5.0|I liked this cover because of it's features.  I wanted an elastic band to keep it closed and also to hook my hand around while reading.  The only feature I would have liked to see was an inside pocket for my credit or coffee card.

B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Tom Hanks &#34;Hits It Out of the Ballpark&#34; again his usual high quality produced movie. The Computer Generated Special Effects are great and I more than once caught myself starring at the characters to see if they were &#34;Real&#34;.This is a movie that the family and yes even a 60yr old Grandfather like me can watch together. Hanks would make &#34;Walt&#34; proud.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i have to say this game keeps myself and all my family members busy for hours at a time..We love it, It's a lot of  fun Great for all age groups and super easy to learn.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I have been reading the Mitch Rapp series by Vince Flynn for years.  They are really exciting.  CIA, FBI, terrorism - and the good guys win in the end.  This latest book in the series was hard to put down - I enjoyed it tremendously.  If you have never read any by Flynn, try this one - and then go back and read the rest!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|is an ok game, when it is not crashing every other minute. now it crashes everytime I try to open it. not much follow up from csr after initial notification.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As author of the murder mystery [[ASIN:B008CEOH8C Wooing The Fates (Detective John Drake)]] and as one having law enforcement experience, I find Michael Connelly's novel \\"The Black Box\\" to be a spot on and intriguing portrayal of life in the law enforcement world. Part of the Harry Bosch series, in this adventure Bosch is working in the cold case unit in the Los Angeles Police Department. The murder of a young woman in the 1992 riots strikes a chord with Bosch who had worked the original crime scene and was forced out as it was given to a special unit.<br /><br />Years later, Bosch investigates the murder as a cold case. He sets out on a complicated trail uncovering slowly one piece of information at a time and striving to find the key to make each piece interlock and to complete the picture. Bosch, old school by nature, believes this victim has been denied justice and her family denied closure.<br /><br />Connelly's story is engaging and entertaining, and his characterization of Bosch as a careful balance of human frailty and courageous strength makes Bosch a hero the reader can appreciate. The author especially succeeds at demonstrating how the quest for personal aggrandizement, the slow crawl of bureaucracy, and the incessant squabble for political gain can hinder the investigation.<br /><br />If you enjoy this genre of police procedurals but have not read Connelly, this book is sure to appeal to you. If you are venturing out into new genre turf, this novel is a great gateway into the world of criminal investigation. Go for it! You will not be disappointed.
B004OEMRGI|5.0|If you find electrified Taureg electrifying, and listen to Tinariwen this is for you. Bombino is more layered than Tinariwen, and more polished, but not over produced. The desert beat is still there, but everything around in more refine. If you are thinking about buying electrified Taureg get this CD because this is not quite root music, but polished Taureg music for the new millennium, and the world.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another masterful job by Vince Flynn.  The twists and turns of his storytelling keep the reader turning the pages.  Mitch Rapp continues his quest to make the world a safer place for those who cherish freedom.

B004SBX112|3.0|Why does it always take several months longer then google app store for updates!!!!!  I payed for this game on amazon. Yet once the update apears on google i have to wait several months after before it apears on amazon! Getting real tired of this! This needs to be fixed or i will stop buying apps hear...
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|...Erases your progress inexplicably. This app is fun and I do not want to discourage you from downloading it. It's fun to use your brain to correct your issues with your construction to complete tasks. But, like Angry Birds, if you do not complete a level you can't get to the next. That said, the game completely erases all my progress last night. It made me realize that I should probably be doing something else around the house or reading a book. I have removed this from my Kindle Fire. Maybe one day I'll try it again after this glitch is fixed.<br /><br />-1 star for sometimes not consistently completing the tasks with the vehicle construction even though run repeatedly then it corrects<br />-1 star for not letting you go to ANY next levels without completing previous level<br />-1 star for glitch that erases your progress<br />+1 really cute and fun game. Keeps my kids riveted.<br />+1 better than Angry Birds in that you get to see your creation at work. Totally cool.
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|Works well installed to Kawasaki Concourse.  Good quality product, would recommend for all motorcycles to mount for all cell phones
B0049M7BDE|4.0|It's getting harder and harder to find reviews that actually cover the quality of the transfer of the movie to Blu Ray rather than reading just a summary of the plot, opinions on acting or whether the film was exciting or not.  This is just a review of the quality of the Blu Ray transfer.<br /><br />I do have the standard definition version which I have not watched in some time so it is really not a comparison review.  The video transfer is good with no artifacting or aliasing anywhere and only the slightest hint of grain which, for the most part ,is undetectable.  However, the transfer to blu ray appears as if the producers crushed the blacks a touch too much creating deep blacks but with not a whole lot of detail in the shadows.  Colors are deep and resolution is good with a fairly warm color grading but there are parts where it just appears to be darkened or shaded.<br /><br />The DTSHD 5.1 audio is really quite excellent with fine use of the entire system and discreet channeling of foley fx as well as panning around the audio system.  Not a whole lot here for the LFE channel to use but the audio editing shines in several places.  The soundtrack is beautifully spread across the front stage with individual instrumentation nicely separated across the stage.<br /><br />There were no extras of any kind on this disc.<br /><br />For me, the bottom line is that the audio transfer is the star of the Blu Ray while the video, while good, appears muted.  I do think, however, that the switch from SD to BR, if the price is good, makes a purchase worthy.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B009JNXK88|4.0|If your looking for a fun 2D platformer for your phone, this one is pretty good.  It has all the 8-bit nostalgia you want in a game. The one problem is the problem with all games like this on the phone.  No physical buttons. If that doesn't bother you though you'll probably find this game relativly entertaining.

B0084IHVC0|5.0|My wife loves collecting Disney movies and now that they are all being re-released in blu-ray its my job to find them and buy them.  This is personally one of my favorites and it look great in blu-ray. The upscaling to 1080 doesn't mess with the picture or warmness you may remember from the VHS days.
075695195X|4.0|I read this book a number of years ago - had lost some of the details in the passing of time, and so I have been recommending this book to teen readers looking for fantasy, so with that in mind, I thought I would re-read.<br /><br />I was pleased with noting that I still love Bartimaeus.  I don't remember disliking Nathaniel's master so much - but I suppose the years have changed me and not the story.<br /><br />The characters are creative and carefully created.  The descriptions are detailed and vivid.  The setting is well constructed and believable.  The story itself is clever and intriguing.  I was glad I took the time to read this story again and will continue to put it in the hands of searching readers!
B004HX4RT6|2.0|I like playing chess but this app is not very good.  The multiplayer is terrible though. Playiing the computer is ok but who wants to play the computer all the time.  In this day and age the multiplayer should be a lot better.
B0034JKZ86|1.0|...are the words that perfectly sum up this movie.The main thing I can say is that if you're Christian, steer well and clear away from this movie.<br />Basically, your Disney villain this time around summons spirits using Voodoo. He happily walks around with Tarot cards and flashes the all-seeing-eye. To enhance my complaint\\", I shall say that his voodoo friends come up from death and drag the villain to Hell, where  us Christians understand him to be. Now the latter scene mentioned here is done in a very dark way and is advertised as a children movie to lure in kids! Kids are watching this and learning.<br />If you let them watch something once, you are planting the seed of voodooism (a seed of evil) into their minds and into their thoughts.<br />Think twice about the new, trashy and evil Disney stuff before you buy. You have been forewarned.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|This is one of Katy Perry's most radio played song I would have to say.  It is not a real \\"party\\" song but is definatly a must have if you live Katy Perry.  Sound Quality from amazon is great and it downloaded fast over 3G.

1454901276|4.0|First Line: They are just kids.<br /><br />Just one month ago, Detective Fin Macleod and his wife lost their only child in a hit-and-run. It has ruined their marriage. Forcing himself to return to work in Edinburgh, Fin finds himself assigned to a murder investigation on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland-- the place where he was born and lived until he went away to university. It will be his first time back in twenty years.<br /><br />Arriving in Stornoway he finds that he's unwanted by a Detective Chief Inspector who's looking for the tiniest excuse to get him off the island. Although Fin intuitively knows that there's no real connection between the Lewis murder and the one he was investigating in Edinburgh, he realizes that he can be of real use because he went to school with the dead man and knows many of the names on the suspect list. What he doesn't know is how deeply into his own past his investigation will take him.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me as I read this book was that the setting should be included in the cast of characters. When Fin Macleod speaks of his childhood on the Isle of Lewis being filled with rainbows, I remembered my first trip to the Isle of Skye when I was bedazzled and enchanted by an endless procession of waterfalls and rainbows. On another trip, I stood on a windswept cliff and looked out across The Minch to the Isle of Lewis and felt its siren song. The author brought this all back to me (and so much more), and I can see many other readers falling under the same spell.<br /><br />There are two magnets in this book: its setting, and Fin Macleod. The unfolding of his character throughout the book by alternating the present day investigation with childhood flashbacks is brilliant. We see a happy little boy whose life is filled with rainbows change into a teenager who can't wait to leave the island forever, and finally into a quiet man who seems filled with regrets... and secrets. Macleod's return to Lewis turns out to be good both for the island and for himself.<br /><br />I'm still a bit under the spell of this book, so I am very glad to know that there are two forthcoming volumes that will continue the story. I can't help but wonder if rainbows will make a reappearance in Fin's skies.ns out to be good both for the island and for himself.<br /><br />I'm still a bit under the spell of this book, so I am very glad to know that there are two forthcoming volumes that will continue the story. I can't help but wonder if rainbows will make a reappearance in Fin's skies.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This is a fun little puzzle game, challenging enough to be interesting, but not frustrating enough to need a walkthrough. I'm sure I'll play it again.
030758836X|1.0|Horrible, horrible book with horrible, horrible characters.  Lord, please don't let there be real people like this.<br />The only reason I continued to read it was because I had purchased it and couldn't stand wasting my money by not finishing it.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|Okay, misspellings in the title were on purpose, but this was one strange movie! I can't say it was terrible, nor was it fantastic. There were some good moments, but many of the child actors are way too smart/knowledgeable for their ages. The premise? It was just a bit too fantastic. But if you're bored and this is the only movie available, its worth a look.
B007P7UF0G|2.0|Bottom line: You could really like this production if it is the one and only version you see. It's hard to ruin the Lerner and Loewe music and \\"Camelot\\" story completely<br /><br />But if you loved the Broadway version and the original score (as I did), you will find this movie lacking in many ways.<br /><br />For starters, the wonderful vocal performances of Julie Andrews, Richard Burton and Robert Goulet far outshine their movie counterparts, who often struggle mightily to meet the music's requirements.<br /><br />Then there are a number of inexplicable musical choices: a bland new overture (the original is a beautiful classic); a rearranged and bland \\"\\"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood\\"; an altered and repositioned \\"Follow Me\\" (leaving a huge plot hole; the lovely original explains Merlin's absence for the bulk of the story); elimination of the wonderful \\"Before I Gaze At You Again\\"; elimination of vital musical plot movers \\"The Seven Deadly Virtues\\" and \\"Fie On Goodness\\" (again creating plot holes).<br /><br />So, if you are a fan of the original but open minded enough to enjoy this movie director's different take on it (he reportedly did not like Julie Andrews or Richard Burton in their roles; go figure), then give it a try.
B005HSL626|3.0|fruit ninga  exiting at first but then in a week it gets annoying and boring.... that's why I deleted it. I don't suggest getting this unless your 3,4,5 or 6. ( possibly 7)
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|Great CD and DVD combo.  Fans will not be disappointed.  Enjoyed watching all the videos spanning her 10 year career.  The 4 extra songs are a nice addition to the CD.  No regrets buying this one for my collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very addicting and fun. I don't like puzzles, but when I tried this app... I loved it!!!! I really really really suggest this game! P.s at first its easy, but then it gets harder. At some hard stages there are easy ones. ; )
B0071XO8RA|5.0|From the analogies to knitting to &#34;pulling the wool over your eyes&#34; this is an artful, poetic, and riveting work.  It permeated both waking and sleeping hours.  The characters grab you and hang on not letting you forget them.  Thank you Mr. Howey and keep writing!
0525953728|5.0|This book delivers exactly what I wanted to know: precisely how they managed to get Osama Bin Laden by one who has a firsthand account.  It had the added bonus of an in-depth description of how the special forces train and prepare for missions such as this.  I couldn't put it down. The author is taking heat from some for sharing so much, but I see no harm to our security.  In fact, it is likely to forewarn potential aggressors to see how prepared we really are.  While I personally don't condone killing, I couldn't be prouder of the men and women who serve us in the special forces after reading this.  How fearless and brave they are and the sacrifices they make for us. No mission is impossible. We are very lucky to have them.  A must-read.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so fun, it never gets old. I am addicted to it. The missions just keep going on and on. There are so many cool gadgets. A must have!!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|You Version's Holy Bible app is probably one of my favorite apps for my Kindle Fire HD. It allows highlighting favorite verses or passages in any color you choose, saves bookmarks, notes, and allows you to see what other people have noted about a verse you like. It has just about every translation you would want and has audio capabilities for some translations. Only improvement for this app would be that it allow for continual scrolling through each page, chapter and book. It is kind of a pain to have to tell it to go to the next page, (which loads at the bottom), and then have to scroll all the way back up to the top of the new page to start reading. It does get a little tedious after awhile. Once they fix this, it will be perfect, but I definitely recommend it.
B000OY8NII|5.0|This is a very creatively written show about an average man who becomes the sheriff of a town filled with scientists and all the chaos that erupts when their inventions go haywire.  A creative spin on the common police procedural shows seen on many stations now.

B003N9ASEI|5.0|This movie was bought as a gift .  It has been a favorite classic for as long as I can remember and the blu-ray edition will be a great update to the old VHS version sitting on the shelf!

It appears that he received a different version than the one I received. This book is 5x8 and nearly 600<br />pages long. And again, alot of information to take in. Appears to be a great purchase that will end up in my BOB.
0345536886|5.0|What an absolutely fun read. I love the characters, the dialogue and the whole storyline. It was funny,interesting and believable if you allow yourself to be taken for the ride. Good to the last drop - and here I thought Grisham had lost his mojo.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love the entire Twilight Saga. I would recomend anyone and everyone to read these. Especially if you have have seen the movies. To me the books are sooooo much better than the movies.  #TEAMEDWARD

B007SGM084|5.0|Great read! I zoomed through all three and cannot wait for the movie (movies?!? Aaahhh, exciting!) I thought the writer did an exceptional job of introducing love, sex and hate in a meaningful, erotic and sensual way. Grey is a phenomenal character, whom you have to love. Ana is innocent and strong - they mesh wonderfully! I implore all to read - you automatically want a better sex life - with the one you are with, which is another caveat to this read. You want and understand what you have as opposed to dreaming of another. Spectacular feelings abound for the love you're in now. Enjoy! I know I did!!!
B000002LFZ|4.0|This album has all the songs that made HS memorable (I'm dating myself!)  Just a good sing along album for classic rock ... except, \\"Tusk\\" of course!!
B0059XTUB8|1.0|After watching this movie, I was intrigued to read the book it was based on, \\"The Prince, the Showgirl and Me\\" by Colin Clark. Although Clark certainly was on the set of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\" and although he certainly had opinions about Monroe and Olivier, he certainly did not have a personal relationship with Monroe that was the core of the movie. I am accustomed to movies, even those about real people, taking liberties with events described in books for dramatic affect, but this kind of wholesale manufacturing I find completely unacceptable.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|If you love Treasures of Montezuma, and Treasures of Montezuma 2, you will absolutely love Treasures of Montezuma 3. It is an awesome game.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Honestly the people who watch this film mostly are going to be the ones who grew up watching these guys.  The CGI was not the best it could be at times which is probably because after the salaries I imagine there was not much left for other stuff.  There is some humor but some jokes you wont get unless you have seen their movies.  I loved this because I am an action fan so if your not an action fan don't expect to be awe inspired by the plot and story.  There is just enough and no more to justify the action.  Overall I am glad the made a second one.  I think the first one was the best and its great to see them in a movie especially all in the same one.  I did expect arnold and norris to play a bigger part but I imagine it was hard to fit that many big characters into the movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Is there a minus 10 rating?  I read it because I was interested to see what has caused this book to be so popular.  I am now more pessimistic about the human race, or at least the fans of this garbage.  This is a sick book, and it is also very badly written.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case works just as I hoped.  It is sturdy, functional and keeps my kindle protected.  I like the fact that you can prop your kindle up and use it kind of like an easel.  Which helps when I'm using one of my recipe apps in the kitchen.
B00785P2QC|3.0|fun game, but the constant need for invest points is a bit much, since the only way to get *enough* is to buy them with real money, which I will not do. I do get the extra points by posting to facebook, but I have the app set so that all my posts are private to me so I don't flood my friends feeds with stupid game updates.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The story provided a realistic insight into what life in small town England.  The focus on rich vs poor, hostility on the local government council, family relationships, and life in the &#34;projects&#34; was well done.  I was curious about Ms. Rowling's ability at writing a story without magical characters and was quite pleased.  It was an easy read, interesting, and held my attention.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this legal mystery.  It was very well written and kept me interested throughout.  All of my friends are now reading and loving it too!

B009HV2JT8|3.0|I knew this movie couldn't be as bad as some of the one star reviews indicated, and it wasn't.  The title says it all.  This Lincoln's weapon of choice is an ax which he swings with skill and gritty determination, all to avenge the murder of his family when he was a boy.  The film is heavy on action and special effects.  Unfortunately, some of the effects wre mediocre at best, most notably during an insane horse chase and the climatic train ride to Gettysburg.  It does do a nice job of weaving in actual events during Lincoln's life, both before his presidency and after, along with the fantastical vampire plot.  This was not enough, however, to make up for a weak story driven by what is seemingly a sudden and confusing desire by the vampires for world domination.  This is a decent enough film, but not one I would watch again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This came in perfect condition. It was still in the plastic wrap and came within the estimated delivery. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys scifi! The show itself is fantastic and makes me sad that there is only one season.

B008RV5K5E|3.0|Mistaken this one for the full movie, but the kids watched it anyway, they thought it was cool enough but adults didn't enjoy it.
0345803485|1.0|A literature student has such a poor grasp of the English language as Ana? These books are poorly written and in insult to women, perhaps the \\"author\\" EL James can write a fourth and interesting book revealing how Christian has been continuing his subversive sex life with multiple women while she mused about her adolescent goddess and met his every whim while he debased her and she fell for his money and phony stories. Please do not waste your money, there is nothing to these books but skilled business and a group of individuals proud they can con the public out of a buck while a woman tours the world pretending to have penned them. I wish I had never heard of these books.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love having a larger, portable version of facebook on my Kindle Fire HD. Seems like they finally fixed the news feed problem. Loving it.
0345803493|1.0|Don't bother with the third installment of this insulting series based on  the dysfunctional relationship between on a violent  egomaniac and his prey Ana. Ana AKA the Goddess, is so incredibly simplistic and imbecilic that she thinks she is loved and liberated and she as she gleefully follows an older man into a world of sleaze as he devotes his life to the whims of his ex lovers.  Read it if you want to endure a moronic woman pleasuring a man sexually and believing she is strong and intelligent. The positive reviews are generated by a money making machine, devoted to cash at the expense of women's integrity. Pathetic and poorly written on top of it.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I saw the remake years ago & loved it. I even think it's way better than the original movie.  Esp the ending scene. When asked what her final Christmas wish was,the little girl answers\\"A Baby Brother\\" Given a choice between the two movies. I know which one I pick.

B00AF8FIOK|5.0|... Yeah the review title is a little lame.. but I didn't know what else to call it.<br /><br />(Contains spoilers)<br /><br />Like many of the previous reviewers, I had my reservations about the Season so far, although I was still very much enjoying every episode. (Not so much the \\"Bitten\\" episode)<br />I liked the inclusion of Kevin, and his mother... Mark Sheppard's continued appearance, and the return of the \\"monster of the week\\" structure.<br />I also thought it was somewhat unorthodox, and intriguing, the way to go about revealing past events concerning Dean and Sam, through flashbacks revealed in every episode.<br /><br />With that said, the episode \\"Hunteri Heroici\\" has become my favorite episode.  I was thrilled with Misha Collins return as Castiel! (Yay! :D)  Better yet,<br />being the \\"third wheel\\" (haha, that part makes me chuckle) to the dynamic duo that is Sam and Dean.  This episode contains a plethora of wit and humor, which I very much adore and is done so perfectly well by the trio, and overall I am thankful and excited to see Castiel, Dean and Sam together again.<br /><br />However, I am -very- surprised with the introduction of Amanda Tapping as \\"Naomi\\". (This was actually revealed in the previous episode but I felt it worth mentioning here)<br />Amanda Tapping! Seriously? And I thought this show couldn't get any better! Wow!  I have been a major fan of her since Stargate SG-1.<br />I digress...<br />All in all, I am ecstatic to watch such a wonderful ensemble of my favorite actors continue to improve upon and polish the Supernatural series.  Bravo, the cast members, writers, producers etc are doing a magnificent job.  Please keep up the good work!  (Now hopefully Jim Beaver comes back as a regular or recurring guest :D!!!)

B007EECSFA|4.0|For the most part, I liked the book.  It was a little long in parts.  It goes back and forth every  other chapter to 1941.  You had to get used to that  Quite a few twists which made it interesting.  I would recommend it.

B0062GM6FS|5.0|A BOOK REVIEW OF: LIFE by Keith Richards<br /><br />I bought this book on November 22, 2010, and I finished reading this book on my 56th birthday on November 13, 2011.<br /><br />This book is a classic! ... There is no one in the world like Keith Richards - that's for darn sure. Keith is a Sagittarius - and I have Venus in Sagittarius in my natal / birth astrological chart, so I have a really hard time not liking this guy. In fact, I find his disarming and self-deprecating candor and humor quite charming. His outright honesty and bold openness about his life is truly refreshing. His sincerity comes through loud and clear like a laser pointed right at your third eye!<br /><br />Keith reveals a lot about his personal life, his days with the Rolling Stones (which, hopefully, will continue for many more years to come), and his life as a recording musician and songwriter - especially as a guitarist, of which he is one of the greats. Reading this book is like having an intimate conversation with one of the leading musical figures of our time. Also, don't let the rock and roll swagger image fool you into thinking that this man has simply written an average book about his life just for the money. He has not. He has too much integrity to do that. Keith Richards is a very literary-minded individual. He reads a lot. He loves great literature and being able to find the time to sit back, relax, and get his head into a good book. This is not your typical rock star behavior. But Keith Richards is not your typical rock star. If anything, he is a-typical in the sense that his stage image reveals only a small part of his total personality and character. There is true depth to this man. Dig in to his great book that he has written about his life, and you will see what I mean!<br /><br />I really like what Keith says on pages 298 and 299 - when the Stones were recording Exile on Main St. - about how he likes to record music:<br /><br />\\"We looked at studios in Cannes and elsewhere, reckoned up how much money the French were going to suck out of us. Nellcote had a large basement and we had our own mobile studio. The Mighty Mobile, as we called it, was a truck with eight-track recording machines that Stu had helped to put together. We'd thought of it quite separately from any plan to move to France. It was the only independent mobile recording unit around. We didn't realize when we put it together how rare it was - soon we were renting it out to the BBC and ITV because they only had one apiece. It was another one of those beautiful, graceful, fortuitous things that happened to the Stones.<br /><br />So one day in June it trundled through the gates and we parked it outside the front door and plugged in. I've never done any different since. When you've got the equipment and the right guys, you don't need anything else in terms of studios. Only Mick still thinks you have to take things into \\"real\\" recording studios to really make a real record. He got proved totally wrong on our latest - at the time of writing - album, A Bigger Bang, especially, because we did it all in his little chateau in France. We had got the stuff worked up, and he said, \\"Now we'll take it into a real recording studio.\\" And Don Was and I looked at each other, and Charlie looked at me... F..k this s..t. We've already got it down right here. Why do you want to spring for all that bread? So you can say it was cut in so-and-so studio, the glass wall and the control room? We ain't going nowhere, pal. So he finally relented.\\"<br /><br />A Bigger Bang - like all of the other albums by the Rolling Stones that begin with the letter `b' - is one of their best albums!<br /><br />You know, at one time - way, way, way back in the beginning when the Rolling Stones, like others, were just another bar band playing covers of blues songs at night clubs in England with Alexis Korner, Graham Bond, and John Mayall - Brian Jones was the heart and soul of the Rolling Stones and the leader of the band.But that did not last long. As soon as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards started to write their own songs - and the band began to take off like a rocket - Keith Richards became the new heart and soul of the band. He's the leader. Mick Jagger may be the quintessential showman (and great businessman) - as well as a great lyricist and songwriter in his own right - but Keith is the heart and soul behind all of those great grooves and guitar melodies. There is more to what goes into making a great song than just the chord changes and the words. The music has to flow, it has to groove, and it has to be imbued with the living spark of inspiration from the Muse. Keith is tapped into that - big time! As I always like to say: \\"The Muse knows who loves her.\\" Like many of us, Keith Richards worships her grace and beauty with his total body, mind, and soul. You can tell - because the music that comes through him could only be inspired by a higher power.<br /><br />YOWZA! - George Koumantzelis / The Aeolian KidBut that did not last long.

B0047WJ12K|5.0|Sweet movie me and my friends watch it all the time great story line. I'd recommend it to any Leonardo fans.
B001QB9H1K|4.0|- very satisfied by picture and sound quality - the 3 franchise movies proved well - picture and sound wise - leave your intel at the door - lots of action - so so plot - passable - have two of the movies so far - might go for the third - will see!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I am hooked.  I can't wait for the next show.  I just started watching after buying the first season, And had to catch up on the second. Will evenyually buy the second season when it is over and released to video.
B005ZKYXZI|4.0|- was going to write it off as implausible and boring - was pleasantly surprised! - has heart and action - also the picture and sound quality were good! - highly recomendded!
B008RJFRTK|5.0|I will use this as a \\"navigator's aid\\" while on trips. My Garmin and TomTom units aren't designed with the use of a navigator in mind, just a driver. My GPS units are great for telling me how to get somewhere, where the nearest food along my route is, etc. They are both terrible for letting my navigator just browse the map. This software with its drag and pinch interface lets her quickly scroll to an area, zoom in & out and generally explore.<br /><br />I have a Kindle Fire HD which means NO built in GPS and NO network connection while driving. (Too cheap to sign up for one of those portable 3G hotspot units) So the offline part is critical to me and the GPS functionality isn't important to me.<br /><br />The $5 is dirt cheap and a no-brainer to add to the $100 or so I have already spent on a standalone GPS unit. In fact, I just spent over $10 ordering a paper road atlas to toss in the glove box.<br /><br />Since you download map data on a state by state basis (for the United States anyway) it doesn't use up a lot of storage for areas I don't care about.<br /><br />For what I need it is a great little application.
B00843TZJM|3.0|- concert was quite o.k. - a buy considering two segments and fine picture and sound quality - first segment was personally not as vibrant as second - were better on 'Hall of Fame' concert<br />but cant expect very great performances from an aging CSN - but they did quite well - considering!
B0086213XW|1.0|Really boring film with empty relationships and a very few interesting though strange moments. I think there might have been about 15 minutes total of mildly interesting content. Otherwise this film was a waste of time.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|The graphics, the storyline and the aids keep you thoroughly engaged without being frustrated or stumped with the game.  I highly recommend this game for anyone!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first book was exciting, but the next two were not much more than a love story.  Not worth it.

B005XLN97M|5.0|The Barbie Beach House was an immediate hit with my eight year old daughter. She adored the curving staircase, the flip-top kitchen counter, the expanding bed (for Barbie sleepovers of course!), and the accessories.<br /><br />This Barbie house is a really affordable way to have all the fun of a Barbie house, without all the space that the Townhouse requires.<br /><br />The Beach House includes two counter stools for the flip-top kitchen unit, a bed that opens from a single to a double, a blanket for the bed, a pillow, a purple couch, food for the fridge, a sink for the bathroom, a shower head, a curving spiral staircase, skylights in the roof, and a door that opens and closes.<br /><br />From my daughter: \\"I love it!\\" This Beach House is a winner in terms of cost, space and sheer fun. We are very happy with this.

B000J10EQU|4.0|The makers of Superman Returns took this challenge seriously for it's an homage to the Christopher Reeves Superman and, in fact, is dedicated to the Reeves. Shorn of its outdated effects, the CR Superman franchise remains enjoyable because of its characters. Bryan Singer's version with Brandon Routh is darker and deeper than before, but the Superman characterization remains. I never cared for the ditzy Lois Lane of Margot Kidder, so Kate Bosworth's moody one is more effective and sexier (at least for me). Kevin Spacey does his best (and effective) impersonation of Gene Hackman. I particularly enjoyed John Ottman's reworking of John Williams' original themes. Only seeing Kumar do the bully role was a bit disconcerting. Loads of tonge-in-cheek references to previous movies -- Superman and others!<br /><br />12/14/2013<br />Viewed movie again. If the extended Lois Lane \\"smoking on the rooftop\\" scene with Superman doesn't move you, you haven't been paying attention. For a \\"comic book\\" movie, this scene rivals any \\"serious\\" movie for its pathos...only to to be relieved by the choice of \\"chicken or tofu wrap.\\"

B004LWZWGK|1.0|This is a great movie, but I will not be purchasing the Blu-ray just for the simple fact that it only comes with an UltraViolet Digital Copy.

I want to watch my movie when I choose and will purchase this directly from iTunes which will allow me to do that.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|A very fun, entertaining, and mentally stimulating game with a price that can not be beat. This game is a must play.
1401324649|4.0|I LOVED all the dastardly characters whose lives turned out for good.  The author wove together the most outrageous story in a very logical way.  Allan may be a hero for all time.  Joseph Campbell named one type of hero as the \\"reluctant hero.\\"  This is a person who doesn't want to be a hero but becomes one because of the circumstances.  In his own humble way, Allan directs the course of history while just wanting another good glass of vodka.  It is sweet, romantic, dark, and absurd yet makes perfect sense.  AND it involves an elephant!  After all our politics, this was a wonderful relief.  We should all have Allan's take on politics and religion... totally unnecessary and often problematic.  I'll drink to that.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|Worth every penny! Love this show! I wont miss an episode this way! I Cant wait for the next season!
B003VR5PPY|3.0|I recently purchased this game after finally getting a DS.  I was very excited to play it, especially after all of the great reviews on here, but at this point, I'm wondering if we were even playing the same game.  \\"Best DS game,\\" \\"Best puzzle game,\\" \\"well-written,\\" are some of the things people are saying...I don't get it!  I love puzzle games, but this is more like an interactive text RPG with a few puzzles thrown in than a puzzle game.<br /><br />And even still, I would be totally fine with that, except that the text is *terrible*.  The story plot is interesting enough, but it's presented in such a way that it's completely intolerable to read.  It goes on and on and on and on about the same thing, with the narration, the main character, and other characters all paraphrasing each other with every little thing.  The worst part is, you can't skip through or fast forward through the text to get to the puzzles, so you're forced to suffer through the banal dialogue and narrating that reads like a bad fan fiction for what feels like hours.<br /><br />As far as the puzzles go, they're fun.  It's a bit like a escape the room sort of game, but a whole sequence of them, tied in with a story.  However, it's not too terribly challenging.  All of the puzzles are spoon-fed to you, instead of leaving you to figure them out yourself, then ask for hints if you need them.  The directions are spelled out no less than three times (two characters of conversations, plus a set of narrated directions before you get into the game) for each of the minigame puzzles, and you have to sit through them each time if you exit the minigame, then go back in.<br /><br />I would not recommend this game, unless you are really into sitting through badly-written, forced text, and puzzles that treat you like you're an idiot, or maybe if you got it for free or very, very cheap.
B009E3EXMU|4.0|Super performance, overall great sound and video presentation but I was hoping for a Jason Bonham camara as one of the extras.  Oh well, can't have everything.  If you don't own this, buy it now!

0307291650|5.0|I have read this book cover to cover, this 3 book compilation of the start of the Vampire chronicle series. The leather-binding is fantastic, with imprinted textured lettering. The pages are premium quality paper that is soft and durable. The edges are golden edge sealed not only protecting the paper, but giving the book's 'thickness' the look of gold.<br /><br /> Not to mention the VALUE of getting 3 books in 1, which saves Space, Money (shipping+ 3 separate books), and mankes the reading experience convenient in a sense of now you can keep reading right on to the next novel.<br /><br />NO Batteries, No apps, No charging. No eyestrain from the electronic reader. A Must have for Rice readers / Vampire enthusiasts.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Ok so I know a lot of people found this book disturbing and quite frankly, many parts of the book i found disturbing as well. Like Travis' compulsion to beat up everyone. I thought this was wrong on so many levels, but more importantly, i was disappointed in the heroine of the story in that she encouraged this behavior.<br /><br />On the other hand, the fact that he obsesses over her doesn't necessarily seem like a bad thing. Yes I said it, so what? Anyone who says otherwise, I am just glad you have never devoted your life to someone only to have them betray you and shatter your heart into a million pieces.<br /><br />I would personally rather have a man obsess over me to the point where he doesn't want to spend a minute without me, than have him sneak around my back with every slut that looks at him.
0307346617|1.0|I could not even get half way through this book, it has no story to speak of. It consists of a bunch of short stories that really don't fit together in any way. I will wait for the movie to hit cable before I pay for it.

0763644765|5.0|This is a great book that seems geared towards kids around 2 yrs old. I think it is probably too babyish for a child older than 3.  My daughter really liked this book when she was 18 mos old and it seemed to get her excited to use the potty. She would frequently ask for this book to be read to her while sitting on the potty. It has very few words so it is a quick read.
1612680011|4.0|This book is helpful for people in general and entrepreneurs in particular, unlike books on entrepreneurship, it sheds light only on the financial inelegance side of any potential entrepreneur. Kiyosaki argues in the book that schools fails to provide students with the necessary financial literacy that is needed to achieve financial independence, and therefore millions of people follow a wrong philosophy to gain money which, as he puts it, (Work Hard and Save Money)). The title Rich Dad Poor Dad refers to the two dads from whom the author acquired his financial inelegance and philosophy. The best thing about this book is the writer's ability to simplify formulas and put it in very simple diagrams and words. The authors moto is \\"Rich people do not work for money, it is money that works for them!\\". Through the book, the author discuses the uninformed decisions that people take in everyday life (Assets V. Liability), and at the end of the book he provides steps toward realizing financial inelegance which in his words is a lifestyle, and which will also lead you to \\"Mind Your Own Business\\".
B008XCM18Q|4.0|I actually liked the Damon films. However, the original highlights the vague sense of dislocation I felt while watching them.<br /><br />Movie Bourne has no context. Without this slice of Cold War paranoia and national discontent the seventies laid on the landscape the superman spy lacks a purpose other than his current motives. With Vietnam and shots being fired across Checkpoint Charlie Borne makes sense. The nation needed men like him.<br /><br />I'm happy I found the book and the original purpose of Bourne.
0061914177|4.0|This book is one among hundreds of books that talk about Business Development, however, its content is really fresh and it approaches everyone instead of a specific category. What is new about it is that it talks about business development through the internet and internet only!. The only tool you need to be rich is the internet! And particularly the social media websites you use in your everyday life. In this case, you don't need money, (though slightly needed at some levels, sums that are affordable by all people,) you need two essential elements; Passion and Resilience!. Gary digresses on the issue of passion and even gives you details on how to test the credibility of a given passion!.  The book employs plenty of successful writing aspects such as asking questions instead of informing and storytelling. Garry is very caring when it comes to his audience, therefore in every chapter you will find his e-mail asking you to write him to share a story, ask for more details or if you have any questions.  Gary places family first!, family comes before everything and tell the story of his family and how they started from the scratch. As a matter of fact, when he said that he is Jewish, he reminded me of a book I read for Malcolm Gladwell by the title (Outliers) which included a chapter under the title (The Importance of Being a Jew), this chapter talks about how economic circumstances and other social elements at a certain period of time forced Jewish immigrants into specific types of industries which actually helped them on the long term to become rich which might be somehow related to Gary's Family.  If I would summarize this book in one sentence I would say: \\"How to Monetize Your Passion Through the Internet\\". It is worth mentioning that Gary does not see it as (all about money), whereas he gives the readers some important facts about the moral and psychological aspects of business development which really addresses some of the capitalist society problems. You don't get this? read the chapter (Legacy) or refer to the explanation of Dale Callahan of core values on ([...])
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This one stays with you a bit ...<br /><br />Well worth watching ...<br /><br />Chose it initially because of the star power, but the message remained more powerful.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|We watch all his movies and already had season 1. This will be a gift for my daughter, we LOVE Eliza Dushku and liked her in TRU as well. Wish this show had not been cancelled. 😔
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is. no nonsense easy to use weather app that delivers.  what more do you need?  its easy to view the locations where I travel before I get there.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Grew up watching the original TV series and found this enjoyable.  Rather campy but one would expect that from a remake.  Depp is amusing as always.
B004P1JEXE|2.0|Unlike the earlier books in the series. Many of the main characters are simply missing from this book. The last chapter is basically an apology from George about this.<br /><br />The plot is lacking the momentum of all its predecessors. Switching viewpoint very often to people not mentioned again.<br /><br />Cerci has much of her tale told and we do get further insights to her Character. The lady of Tar th continues her quest but I don‘t feel she was as rounded as she could be.<br /><br />Struggled to keep reading where before I struggled to put the others down
B00AA7O22U|5.0|What more can one expect from a movie that included all the action heroes he grew up on.  High body count, lots of explosions, great fight scenes and plenty of bad jokes.<br />Would watch it again.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Oh, what a tangled web we weave is the major theme of this book.<br />I cannot believe that the imagination could produce such a complicated plan without making it so incredibly fascinating, however, I loved the fact that for the life of me, I could not guess where it was ending up. I enjoyed it so much, as I always do Grisham's books and I plan on reading the books he will have published in the future for my Kindle from Amazon.<br /><br />I must add that he really overemphasized and went into such great length with the process of how to disguise and transport the gold. The storyline and characters make this an exceptional read.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|I got this as a FAoTD and I am not disappointed. It does not do anything else, it is not a fighter or adventure, it is a landing and flying simulation only. For that, the graphics and gameplay are excellent. A perfect example of having an attainable goal and reaching it without doing a lot of other stuff that gets in the way of excellence.
0061474355|5.0|Garth Nix opened a new world to many readers with his young adult fantasy, me included.  When you first read Sabriel you are transported into a world of magic an intrigue that is like nothing else.  You see the struggles of a young girl trying to make her way into a world that is full of danger and destruction.  All of the strength of narrative that I appreciate in a fantasy experience is present, you never feel duped or let down, while at the same time not feeling like the author is holding your hand.  All of this and a talking cat make Sabriel one of my favorite books of all time, and a great addition to anyone's book case.  I have, and would again, recommend it to people of any age.  This is a great book for someone new to the genre, and especially for a younger reader who enjoys action, adventure, love, loss, and a talking cat. (Never forget the talking cats.)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Glad there was less bdsm and sexcapade scenes in this one. I rather enjoy the actual story and reason why grey is how he is, I don't however need a new sex scene every five to ten pages.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn delivers another great book in his usual fast-paced manner.  I love his characters and the way that he keeps them consistent throughout the series.  Mitch Rapp is a hero.
B0047N0Y52|5.0|This is an excellent choice of toy for your kids 5 and up. It's one of the best things you can get for the money. It is engaging, it demands thinking and teaches kids to use logical thinking. At the same time it is very interesting and dynamic, makes an excellent present as well. It is a small box and it's easy to store. Don't hesitate to get it. It's great.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|The acting in this movie was fine. Did not like the flashback style as there was little connection between the past and present scenes. Do not recommend spending the 2 hours needed to watch this movie.
0061474355|5.0|Anything by Garth Nix is a great read and the Abhorsen trilogy is no exception. Well executed and delivered, Sabriel will keep you reading! Enjoy!
B00979CS50|5.0|I saw Neil and Crazy Horse perform several of the songs off this album at his most recent Bridge School concert and I loved this new material immediately-Ramada Inn, Born in Ontario, Twisted Road.  Then I purchased the CD and enjoy Walk Like a Giant and For the Love of Man.  I get the chorus to Walk Like a Giant stuck in my head whenever I listen to the song.  I know that Neil plays many old licks in his new tunes, but this doesn't bother me. I've always appreciated his lead guitar playing and the quality of his voice and for me Crazy Horse is as powerful as ever.  He and the band have great chemistry. I'm glad that he continues to create and appreciate that this new album came out so soon after Americana.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this works very well. good choices for settings.  easy on the eyes. can setup multiple alarms.  its so easy my 18 month old changed my settings and ringtones.  seriously!
B0073LWEXK|2.0|This game seemed pretty interesting when I first started. However, it gets pretty confusing very quickly. I was constantly backtracking to get an item so I could backtrack even more to get another item. It just continued like that in a vicious cycle. The map was not easy to read and the hint guide (which I was using frequently as what I had to do and where I had to go was not always clear) was not accessed very quickly. It seems like the game developers didn't take the time to adequately test this game. Honestly, unless you really like being lost, I would not recommend this game. I gave it 2 stars only for the graphics and concept.
0446547654|5.0|ive read many of sparks books but this one was the best of all to me. I loved how the ending wasnt what i expected. sad, but also good ending.
B004BLDD9Y|2.0|I purchased this bulb in August and in a little over 4 months it has burned out. I have several other LED bulbs that are older than this one and haven't had any problems. I would avoid this particular LED bulb. I feel the build quality is subpar.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I am a pianist and found it a little hard to keep up with.  It will be good for my grandchildren to play.
B0047SF41G|5.0|Predators is a faithful return to the franchise's roots that is nearly as good as the original.  It successfully captures the essence of the first movie while slightly expanding the mythology, and even references the Schwarzenegger movie to make a proper homage to the action classic.  While it doesn't have the mega-star power or the quotable catch phrases of Predator, the cast put forth an above par effort for what you'd expect from an action film.  Add in a masterful pseudo-cameo role by Lawrence Fishburne and you have a movie that is destined to be just as much of a classic as the original.<br /><br />If you remember Predator fondly, Predators is a must-see.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Fast Shipping<br />Excellent Price<br />Brand New as promised<br />I am happy I finally got this movie, i have wanted to see it for a while.
B002RSDW80|5.0|How can you go wrong with Meryl? Our family has now watched this moviemany times. We will wear it out.
B0011Z32KI|4.0|It's time is a great cd. Buble is so versatile, and the songs just make you want to sing along.
0897500482|5.0|Bruce Lee has always been my favorite martial artist and one of my favorite actors. But it wasn't until I read this book that I started to truly understand him and the way he saw the world, not to mention his fighting techniques. There is truly no stone left unturned in this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an exceptional app for the Kindle Fire HD. It's become my go-to calculator. It's beautifully designed and easy to use.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love these books, I can't put them down. Almost to the end of the series. It is very original story.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I tried to download this item but I have a kindle not a kindle fire! So I can't play the HD games! I was really disappointed! Alas I can't review a game I can't purchase! Please credit back my account!

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I am a 6th grade teacher and ordered two copies for my classroom.  This book is interesting to all levels of readers, but my lower readers are attracted to it because it is a quick, interesting read.  All of the books in this series are well suited for elementary aged readers.
B00A787PPS|4.0|The kindle version was just as I expected it. The only problem with it, which is<br />not peculiar only to the GMAT Review but other kindle documents, is the difficulty<br />in browsing the document. It takes a certain kind of patience working with kindle's<br />location instead of page systems.
B004DK49DW|4.0|Mouse:  \\"So I hear you guys had some trouble with drummers on this outing that sounds like a scene from Spinal Tap.\\"<br /><br />Mike Ness: [falling out, with the rest of the band laughing]  \\"I'm sure you're not the first to think that ... but you're the first one with the balls to say so.  The album kept pushing back at us like we were headed up hill slippery rails.  Atom Willard left to jumpstart Angels & Airwaves, tried out Scott Reeder, then to our current drummer David Hidalgo, but not before actually recording much of the album with session drummer Josh Freese ... however you might want to consider our label change, and a whole mess of other shit that just piled up so fast it snapped my head back, making us feel like 2006 was yesterday.  [slapping my leg] Sorry about the balls thing.\\"<br /><br />Some have said that the album's derivative and too commercial, but you won't hear that from me.  And you know, that's an issue that raises it's ugly head more times than not when it comes to Punk and Post-Punk sounds, than just about any other genre.  Sure it's fine to deliver a couple of hardcore albums of blistering lightening fast guitar work, driving rhythms, and spit into the wind lyrics ... but as time moves on, any band worth their weight is gonna branch out.  The trick is to remain true to the roots, true to the concept, true to the tattoos, and give the fans something they can slam a beer down on the bar to ... and to that end Social Distortion has laid claim to another brilliant outing, one that's full bodied, relentless with it's lyrics, and has developed a new sound that's fresh without being careless or forgetting where they came from, and who they're playing to.<br /><br />For me, the album was worth the wait, for me, there's a mile wide smile slapped across my silly face, for me, I'll drop a quarter in the juke box anytime there's a Social D song to be  played.  I will say that I loved the slowed down considered songs the most, \\"California,\\" \\"Gimme The Sweet And Lowdown,\\" and \\"Writing On The Wall,\\" they just spark with a resonance that's like nothing the band has done before ... full of angst passion, and delivered with righteous honesty.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslereet And Lowdown,\\" and \\"Writing On The Wall,\\" they just spark with a resonance that's like nothing the band has done before ... full of angst passion, and delivered with righteous honesty.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B005LW5J9O|3.0|I was surprised that so many discoveries like atomic structure, setting of the days of the year, creating hydraulics, makeup of the universe were made more than two thousand years ago.  The account of the preservation of books and how they were copied was new to me but this book was very slow and put me to sleep many times. It took me a while to absorb what he was saying, consequently it took me a look time to get through it.  I was surprised at the  the role of the monasteries in the preserving books but I knew about the corruption within the church.  I don't think the title fit the book, since I doubt that the book On the Nature of Things really caused the world to \\"swerve \\"  but all in all it was a very informative book and gives you a different perspective on things.
B004BSALEW|4.0|Jimi Hendrix, whom I've seen live twice, produced three perfect albums during his short sweet, drug fueled life ... Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold As Love, and Electric Ladyland.  While Band Of Gypsys was very very good, and spelled very wrong, it marked a sea change for Jimi, where he was beginning to perhaps move beyond the hype, to something more inclusive.  As to West Coast Seattle Boy, one must look far beyond the previous compilations, outtakes, bootlegs, live recordings, and look at this dynamic release in the scope of history, and musical integrity ... a statement that in one fashion or another could easily have been used when discussing any of the previous here to fore unreleased material outings.  And, I suppose, to that end, this one does fill the bill yet again.<br /><br />Opening this monstrous collection, especially if you've shelled out the bucks for they vinyl collection, are a grouping of songs from the sidemen who added sparks, flavor, and layered the music of Jimi Hendrix with rich swirling thickness.  Of course die hard fans want all of the inflections, nuances, versions, and often find themselves listening for a single odd or misplaced note to filter in from the stratosphere on which to build a whole new musical interpretation. And believe me, there's more of that there than you'll absorb in a lifetime.  Though for me, it was the odd little numbers such as \\"Tears Of Rage,\\" or the instrumental of \\"Castles Made Of Sand\\" that filled my ears, and sent shivers down my arms.  There's an untitled twenty minute jam between Young and Hendrix that's mind boggling, a number of quiet blues laden tracks, and several songs that fell to the cutting room floor, never making it to the Band Of Gypsys release that fill in many of the gaps, nearly redefining what he was thinking, and working through.  Other songs that would become hard driving rockers are presented here almost shyly and understated, bespeaking an innocence that one normally doesn't associate with Jimi Hendrix<br /><br />While it would be easy to dismiss many of these tracks as songs on their way to becoming something, if Jimi were still walking the planet, but since he's not, I'll sit here with these grains of sands, hold them like they were diamonds [at least eleven of them], and hope for a glimmer of his golden winged ship passing my way.<br /><br />Review by Jenell KeslerJimi Hendrix<br /><br />While it would be easy to dismiss many of these tracks as songs on their way to becoming something, if Jimi were still walking the planet, but since he's not, I'll sit here with these grains of sands, hold them like they were diamonds [at least eleven of them], and hope for a glimmer of his golden winged ship passing my way.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B0099116AY|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed the movie.  Streep and Jones shine.  Our fifteen year old granddaughter watched the movie with us. She said it was interesting but I cringed each time the therapist probed into their sexual issues. My disappointment was the fact that, unless I missed the point, Jones' anger was never addressed. I kept thinking he was hiding something from her. His verbal bullying annoyed me and I found it hard to believe she tolerated it for as long as she did. What anger issues caused his verbal abuse?  I am glad the movie stopped short of him physically abusing her. This is my personal opinion but I found it sad to watch
B004AHNIGM|4.0|Low Country Blues could just have easily been called, My First New Album In Fourteen Years, though that may be an overstatement, because while the album is certainly new for Gregg, all but one of the tracks is original ... and  I've been having a bit of a love / hate relationship with this album for just that reason.  My first experience with the Allman Brothers was seeing them live at the Fillmore, where they recorded their legendary album.  At that time the boys were all about flying low, playing off of each other, bending and shaping comfortable notes with mostly original tunes, all laced within a haze of blue smoke that hung in the air, and mixed with the lights, like a spider's web heavy with dew in front of a big ol' yellow moon.<br /><br />Now ... with that description in mind, this is a really fine comfortable, knock you back, kick your shoes off album.  Gregg got himself back in the studio, long hair and all, and lovingly recorded these sensational covers like they were his own flesh and blood, sounding fresh ... as if being heard for the very first time, with a warm homespun take, and presented with that filtered haze that I can almost still smell.  This is an easy album to slip into, so easy that it's over before you realize it.  The thing that put the real smile on my face was saying, \\"Hey, I know that song,\\" then realizing that it actually was a cover, and by one of this country's legendary artists, one who manages to showcase unique arrangements of iconic blues classics.  There's a lot of fun to be had here, so pleased don't miss it.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B00AE2I4B6|4.0|Isn't that what you expect from the Step Up series? Kathryn was hot as usual. The scrap metal statue art was pretty cool too.
0670022411|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas present, she will love it!  This is a great story, very interesting. Merry Christmas!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|this is community's only good season. they got too weird and lost creativity later on in the series. troy and abed are too funny. community is a must see
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was recommended to me.  From page one I was involved and curious with the characters.  The story is heartfelt, tragic, historical, and believeable.  Loved it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Excellent soltaire game.  I really like the stats keeping that it has.  The ad that pops up after you hit deal is alittle annoying, but you can live that.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Lots of action, movie keeps you interred.  Lots of neat ideas that needed to be developed.  This is a good movie for those looking for action, adventure, and a flair of science fiction.  The ending I didn't care for, it just left me hanging.  It was like they wasn't sure what or how they wanted the movie to end.
B003PJ6UHA|4.0|This concept fits nicely with personal theories on which 've ruminated for many years.  The authors personal anecdotes were necessarily illustrative.  I'll possibly return to give this tome 5 stars should a sequel, if at all planned, provide updated knowledge ...
0345803485|5.0|I read the first chapter and immediately ordered the other two books in the trilogy. This book appealed to women of all ages. I really enjoyed it and my grown daughter read it at the same time as I did. I have had so many discussions with so many women over this book. I was captivated by the two characters and didn't find any of the sexual aspects offensive at all. Actually, quite the opposite.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book started off a little slow in comparison to Morton's other books but was totally worth reading on. Superb once again.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|How can you not adore this game? It is challenging and so stinking cute. My grandkids love playing it also.
B000FC10MU|3.0|OK, waiting to see what HBO does with a tv show. Would like to see a sequel to find out what happens to Shadow.
0345803493|5.0|I wasn't sure about continuing to read this series but I am really glad that I did.  I will suggest that you read the last book in the series. That makes it all come together and you understand the complexities in this relationship.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was the first book by this author that I have read, and it won't be the last. I really enjoyed the story.
0345803507|5.0|I am so glad that I read the last book in the trilogy. It tied (no pun intended) everything together. You really understood where the characters were coming from and why they acted the way that they did. Interestingly enough my grown daughter and I read them at the same time. We had some points to discuss, but obviously we both didn't talk about the sexual part. That would have been too weird for us. This trilogy has captivated women of all ages.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good but a little to short for my taste. Read this book , it is hilarious! Vv out peace yo.@
1400067820|5.0|This is a hard book to describe so I won't try too hard.  I've noticed some of the reviewers have obviously missed the point of the book and focus on the wrong thing.  If you want to know what the book says then get it and read it for yourself.  It is impossible to digest a 400+ pages of dense text into a short Amazon review.<br /><br />I do not agree with everything and every recommendation in this book.  That said however I agree with its essential ideas about fragility, randomness, predictions, etc.  It is very persuasive.  I bought this book because I liked Taleb's previous book [[ASIN:0812979184 The Black Swan]].  I liked this book so much I have purchased the Audible version as well so I can listen to it.  I find that both reading and listening to a book allows for much better digestion of the material.<br /><br />There is incredible insight about the way the world works in this book.  It is not a light and breezy read.  You have to think and think hard when you read it.  So this is a thinking person's book and if that is not what you are looking for then skip it.<br /><br />I appreciate the author's honesty and willingness to name names.  He practices what he preaches.  This is a very different book than the usual pap you will read so I suggest you make a very value-adding exchange - shell out the price of a lunch and buy this book.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B0044WUJQ0|5.0|I love this movie and notice that even at Halloween, it is rarely shown.  I ordered it because I really missed seeing it.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Graphics are well done and is a nice casual game. Worth a look if you enjoy the gem type games.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I was anxiously awaiting Susan Boyle's next CD, and I was overjoyed when I found that it was available.  I am not the type of person to be a great &#34;fan&#34; of a performer, but I am, indeed, a fan of this lady.  What a voice!  I was a little taken aback when I heard her version of &#34;Over the Rainbow,&#34; as the arrangement is very different from anything that I've heard before.  However, after listening to it a couple of times, I do like it.  I enjoy hearing both songs with which I am familiar and those with which I have no experience.  The addition of Michael Crawford and Donny Osmond for a few duets is most pleasant.  I am already awaiting a new CD that I surmise will be available in the fall of 2013.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|My 7-yr-old has fun playing this game, but I was surprised to find out that the Mighty Falcon blitz is costing me money.  If you purchase this game, be extra careful that you watch your kid play the game to keep something like this from happening.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I purchased this movie because I love Johnny Depp and had to add this to my collection of movies he had been in. But most of all after viewing this movie I found that the overall suspense was spectacular and kept my mind guessing on what was about to happen. So if there is anyone whom has not viewed this movie yet I say get this you will not be disappointed.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was recommended to me.  It was an easy, fast paced read.  Disappointed on the ending-did she lose interest and will kill him, worried about the child, don't like stories that don't have a real ending.
0061474355|5.0|I adore this series.  I first read it in middle school, and among the thousands of books I've read and re-read, coming back to Sabriel and the world of the Abhorsen has always felt like coming home.  Yes, it's a fantasy novel, but it is also so much more than that.  It has a vibrancy of characters and such a rich, heart-breaking world that even on the seventh read I fear that something unexpected and terrible could happen to the beloved characters.  (I even cry sometimes...just at that end part.  Those of you who have read it before will completely understand why.)  I am now a high school teacher and I have recommended this book to so many.  It's adventure that makes your heart race and fumble to turn the pages.  It's a love story that will twist your heart in pieces as you long for life to give way just enough for their happiness.  It has one of literature's most compelling, and powerful forces of darkness.  The very best part of it all is that Garth Nix has taken a young woman on the verge of adulthood, given her tremendous, terrible trials, and allowed her to bloom within the storm into an incredible, honorable woman.  Every young person should consider reading this.

B003XVYLDU|4.0|Read it several times and saw the old movie based on this book because the idea of time being a curved line  and not a straight one is a very interesting idea.

B004A8ZWVK|3.0|I enjoyed \\"The Help\\" but for all the wrong reasons. I loved the high production values, the beautiful lighting, the shots of ripe agricultural fields in the Deep South. I especially loved the exquisite, tailor-fit, vintage, early 1960s dresses worn by the white actresses. I got a huge kick out of the over-the-top performances. Bryce Dallas Howard, though a living person, is every bit the Walt Disney cartoon villainess. You love hating her. You grimace when she cackles and you cackle as she reaches her inevitable, and utterly unbelievable, nightmare, revenge-dream-fantasy downfall. Howard should have won an academy award. Viola Davis, who radiates soul and depth and can make you cry just by walking into a room, is the deep, rich heart of this otherwise silly film. Octavia Spencer is adorable. She's as big-eyed and woebegone as a DW Griffith Gish sister. I have no idea why Emma Stone is the star. She can't act much and she isn't a drop dead beauty. Maybe she knows someone.<br /><br />\\"The Help\\" is about black-white relations in Mississippi in the early 1960s. Jim Crow Mississippi was a terrorist state. That sounds like an extremist statement; it is not. The Mississippi Sovereignty Commission planted spies in every nook and cranny of Mississippi life. It aided at least one assassin, Byron de la Beckwith, who murdered Medgar Evers. This deadly serious, tense, historic era is reduced, in \\"The Help,\\" to a very pretty soap opera featuring magical Negroes - a term used to describe black characters in mostly white films who exist only to provide a means for the main, white character to grow.<br /><br />You notice immediately in \\"The Help\\" that the white women are all slim, elegantly and flatteringly dressed, and pretty. The black women are plump, older, and plain. But, this is an uplifting film about Civil Rights, so all the black women are noble, giving, selfless, and saintly, while all, except one, of the whites are vicious, vacuous, selfish, and bad mothers. Also, all the whites are filthy rich. Was it really that way, you have to ask? No, it wasn't. Mississippi has one of the highest white poverty rates in the US. And some whites joined the Civil Rights struggle, performing the ultimate sacrifice, and giving their own lives. Still waiting for a feature film about Viola Liuzzo.<br /><br />Maybe it's not such a bad thing that simplistic and overtly exploitative movies like this get made. If they interest any viewers in the Civil Rights movement, that's not a bad thing.

Was it really that way, you have to ask? No, it wasn't. Mississippi has one of the highest white poverty rates in the US. And some whites joined the Civil Rights struggle, performing the ultimate sacrifice, and giving their own lives. Still waiting for a feature film about Viola Liuzzo.<br /><br />Maybe it's not such a bad thing that simplistic and overtly exploitative movies like this get made.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|The erotic scenes were fascinating, then the characters seemed to be so far out there, that I couldn't<br />keep reading about them.  It didn't make sense to me that some people think pain is necesary for pleasure.
B008Y212PI|4.0|same as the others. great app. still makes you do this despite paying for it which is mildly shady but hry cant win them all
B008458O3S|5.0|It is a great game works good spent lots of time on it. I just love it. You feel pretty good about yourself when you figure it out.
0865479410|5.0|You're not necessarily a pessimist, in fact one might say you're a realist, but when people tell you, \\"C'mon, smile.  Cheer up.  Don't be so negative,\\" you not only don't feel better, you want to smash them (and then that would make you feel better).<br /><br />This book is truly the antidote to the empty, banal approaches to happiness.  It shows you that not only when you embrace your obstacles, setbacks and instances you feel let down, can you feel better, but you will often experience breakthroughs that never would have happened had you not had the setback.<br /><br />I have had hundreds of breakthroughs in my life and nearly all of them were preceded by breakdowns that were uninvited, unpleasant, often deeply painful and sometimes even traumatic.  What I have finally realized and tried to apply is that those breakdowns were keys to the breakthroughs, which wouldn't have happened without the breakdown.<br /><br />So now when I hit a setback or obstacle or a breakdown I say to myself, \\"Let time pass, don't do anything to make it worse for 72 hours and you will probably have a breakthrough.\\"<br /><br />I love that I now have a book like \\"The Antidote\\" to keep me company while I am waiting for that breakthrough and \\"white knuckling\\" until I reach it.<br /><br />Another companion book that will help you get the most from \\"The Antidote\\" is Russell Bishop's practical and tactical book, \\"Workarounds that Work: How to Conquer Anything that Stands in Your Way at Work.\\" [[ASIN:007175203X Workarounds That Work: How to Conquer Anything That Stands in Your Way at Work]]
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I thought it was well written and I liked that it was written from the prespective of an elderly character looking back on her earlier life.  I felt that the details made the story very realistic.  Highly recommend this book.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  If you have not seen, I would recommend it to anyone.  Keira knightly is wonderful in this role.
0547391005|5.0|I grew up reading these from my brothers, but there is something classic about Curious George where it is timeless.  I don't care much fo rthe cartoons because they don't require as much imagination.  Love all of these classic books and I'm glad they are still around
B008BM0IUG|5.0|The science in this book is clearly explained. It is a book to make one think and stimulates further thoughts.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I cant figure out how to play. The game doesn't tell you. I made it past the introduction but not through the game. suggestions?
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Definitely worth the read. The characters were enjoyable but be aware that there was very little depth to the book.  Don't want to include spoilers so I will say that I did love that it did go through the typical romance novel steps......beginning w/disliking then liking, then misunderstanding.........These two liked each other from the start!
B007V65R54|3.0|Not really anything new - old wine in old bottles. It discusses the stories of a few major organizations, not necessarily representative of the thesis he is promoting.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|Suitable for adults as well as children. I found Danny DeVito as the Lorax to be annoying...difficult to see the animated character and not Danny.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|An enjoyable and thoroughly engaging story - wildly unrealistic but funny, particularly for anyone seriously looking at aging or living with aging persons.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Excellent Pixar installment. Story line wasn't geared to the animated age group. Clean adult humor, and some not suitable for small children.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This is a surpisigly fun game.  It will not make me forget Diablo but in a pinch, it is a good bit of hack 'n' slash fun.
B009YVBZO6|1.0|I am a big fan of overseas local radio available over the internet, so I was all for this working out well. But when I tried to listen to Ireland by genre under Community I pulled up listings but nothing played. So I tried a larger city, then under the heading of Popular as well as News,  trying many different listed stations each time. I also double checked my system audio level and heard a confirmation beep at one point. So the volume was up and audible. I'll try it again in the future if it is updated, but for now I am uninstalling.
B005CKPQNE|4.0|This season depicts Walt's descent into a darker drug kingpin. Not at all what I'd expected from the show's writers. It's as though Walt's losing his capacity for any compassion.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This movie is wonderful on so many levels. It gives parents a frightening reality of just how much you may not really know your kids, and how if you did have a child like this and knew he felt this way, how in the world would or could you change his thinking? The story is touching, sad and disturbing at times, sometimes a little funny, and the scenery is breathtaking. Not to miss!
B00870ZH3U|1.0|I am a HUGE fan of Phantom of the Opera but this story RUINS it.  They should have left it alone.  Not worth the $3.99 I paid to rent it.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|OK.  Little gorey.  I had a friend of mine that loved this movie, but it was not so great for me even though I normally like this kind of movie.
B00005UOKM|2.0|Too much for me. Maybe it's called improve.<br />Six more words required to submit. Six, five, four, three, two, one.

B00993FEUK|4.0|My kid has watched it repeatedly, thus, so have I. I like it quite a bit. I basically listened to it and read while the kids watched, but as they keep putting it in, I get more and more interested. I think it's pretty good.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I own apple computers, have never been a Steve Jobs fan because he has had such a reputation as a miserable person to work for. A business professor told me at a party that I should read it anyway so I did. It was not only an incredible story about a person who built the most valuable company in the world, it was also a fascinating history of the PC from an apple centric point of view. Probably the best book I have read this year.
1449410243|5.0|Although some of the comics are also on the website, it's nice to have something physical to flip through to look at those comics again.  The new material is also great.  Cat lovers will enjoy this because The Oatmeal truly has a great knowledge of cats and their behavior. :)
B001CDWFPC|4.0|The ESV Study Bible is a fantastic resource that I would recommend to anyone for personal bible study or more in depth study. I will only say a small amount about the content though, since most of this review is with regard to the formatting for kindle.<br /><br />From all I've seen of the study bible notes, they are sound in terms of doctrine yet honest enough to make it known if there is debate about the particular meaning of a phrase or sentence. The translation is probably the most up to date translation from Greek and Hebrew into English, using the latest yet sound research to determine the most accurate translation. I'm no professional theologian but in my day to day use, I have not yet found evidence of so called liberal theology or research, in any of the study notes or translation notes or articles. A word for word (literal) translation philosophy has been used, as opposed to idea for idea translation philosophy where the translator has to make more decisions about the overall meaning of a phrase before he/she can translate it into English. Yet, I find the ESV Study Bible very readable, rather than difficult to understand as some other literal translations can sometimes be.<br /><br />The articles give brilliant insight and certainly help show the depth of God's self-revelation in Scripture. Some examples of articles are:<br />Overview of the Bible: A Survey of the History of Salvation<br />Introduction to the Pentateuch<br />Introduction to the Historical Books<br />Introduction to the Poetic and Wisdom Literature<br />Introduction to the Prophetic Books<br />The time between the Testaments<br />The Roman Empire and the Greco-Roman World at the Time of the New Testament<br />The Theology of the New Testament<br />The Date of Jesus' Crucifixion<br />God's plan of Salvation<br /><br />As far as the FORMATTING FOR KINDLE goes, it is fairly well formatted and as long as you know how to navigate, it is actually quite easy and fairly quick to jump to various parts of the Bible. (Click Menu, click index, type in book abbreviation with chapter and verse separated by a space - Obviously you need to know the correct abbreviations or you'll end up in a totally different book than the one you intended.)<br /><br />Moving between study bible notes and the Scriptural text is smooth as long as you know what the different characters indicating notes mean (A cross refers to a study bible note, whereas small superscript letters refer to cross references).<br /><br />While there have been several improvements in navigation since I first bought this Study Bible, the one thing that could be more streamlined is the navigation of the concordance. I use the concordance a lot and it's a bit of a cumbersome process to have to click menu, click go to, click table of contents, click the right button until I see concordance, then click concordance. Also, once you get to the concordance, you can select any letter of the alphabet that you want, but once you've selected any given letter, you can't jump to the next letter of the alphabet using the right arrow for example. You have to scroll through all the A words for example to get to one of the words at the end of that list or the left arrow to go back to the beginning of the list where you can click TOP to go back to the list of letters. As yet I'm not aware of any solution to this, to make navigating the concordance easier, or to search words within the concordance only. However, this won't stop me using this resource on my kindle. For quicker concordance navigation, I have found the design of the NIV Life application study bible more streamlined, but I do use the ESV Study Bible for kindle more despite this since I prefer the translation and the study bible notes.<br /><br />Still, I don't hesitate to recommend this resource for the kindle.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is beyond a success. Millions of fans tune in each week to see what is happening with their favorite character. The show draws you in to a point that you feel you have a connection with the characters and that you sometimes feel as anxious as the characters are. The show is about the survivors, THEY are the walking dead, not the walkers (zombies). The show is so much more than blood, guts and gore.....it actually has a story, and it is a good one. The story is well thought out and made very well for television. Some may disagree because all they want is zombies, but if that is the way the show was made it would have been cancelled after it's 2nd season. Season 3 has been non-stop and full of action and drama...enough to keep the viewers happy and wanting more. No one is safe on the show, even the main characters are being killed off...but no one knows who or when, and that is part of the draw that keeps us coming back for more!
B008458O3S|5.0|this is a fun game for the kindle fire. it is challenging but not so much that you pull you hair out. good tutorials and a great concept. worth a buck.
B0043EV774|5.0|If you're looking for a good family movie to show on movie night on your new large screen 3D TV, this is a great one to start with. however, if you've never seen it before, you might want to preview it before you show it to very small children. The mad Hatter is scary, not to mention Alice with sword in hand.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|Touchscreens and I don't get along very well. I poke and poke at my cell phone, and it ignores me. Occasionally it does something other than what I am trying to \\"press\\". Once and a while it actually responds as I want.<br /><br />My Kindle Fire is almost as bad.<br /><br />So I tried this stylus. Either the small or medium point works well on my cell phone. Far, far, better than my finger. Better than I thought my phone was capable of. Same with the Fire. It's a whole new experience for me to have touchscreens actually obey my commands!<br /><br />This is my first stylus, so I can't say it is the best you can buy. I don't know if it will still work five years from now. But I can say it has it all over my finger! At least as far as touchscreens are involved ...
B005OK81HA|4.0|The boys hit the song list well with covering past hits and also pulling others and putting their mark on them...sound is tight and lots of energy.
0060734191|5.0|I love these books have read them all multiple times and recommended them multiple times. The books move at an excellent pace and you don't want to put them down. Thumbs up for the fantastic delivery of how magic works in these stories as well as the originality of the bells, and their beautiful descriptions.
1451638450|5.0|Sorry I couldn't think of a better title for this wonderful story from LMB, but it fits. For a man who has been little more than an occassional, unwilling side kick to his cousin's crazy adventures, this great story does Vorpatril proud. Conned into helping a mysterious girl, and fumbling his way though as usual, we finally see Ivan caring about someone, actually wanting to help and becoming the Vorpatril, he was destined to be. I don't give away scenes or spoilers, you have to read this one. It is clearly another great Vor Story by the \\"McMaster\\" I loved it.
0553386697|5.0|A good read for anyone, but especially for those who have kids.  The strategies work in dealing with my own frustrations.
1439152802|4.0|Laurel Nicolson is sixteen and hiding from the rest of her siblings in a treehouse. While in the treehouse, she sees her mother, Dorothy Smitham, do a horrendous act that causes Laurel to faint and then to be left wondering for the rest of her life what exactly happened.<br /><br />The story goes between London in the 1940's when the Nazi's are bombing and the present day.  Dorothy Smitham is dying and Laurel, now in her sixties, wants to find out from her mother what actually occurred on that fateful day at their family farm.  Dorothy Smitham in her youth, depicted in the 1940's, is not a likeable character at all. I had a difficult time trying to figure out how she went from a young woman who cared for nothing or nobody but herself, to the the present day woman who loves her children and was a wondeful mother.<br /><br />However, all comes around and the reader understands the transformation in the end.  It does take a long time for the wrapup which occurs in the last chapters of [[ASIN:1743117094 The Secret Keeper]]and I felt the story lagged at certain points, however, you will be stunned by the end of the book.  Kate Morton does a wonderful job of wrapping up all the loose ends.

B000ID1J40|5.0|With an all-star cast, phenomenal wit and a strong plot, Sneakers is easily one of my all-time favorite movies.<br /><br />What I can review is the delivery format; I &#34;rented&#34; the video from Amazon, and streamed it at my in-law's house while we were visiting for the holidays. I had a couple small glitches (freezing while the video rebuffered) when getting the movie started, but all in all I found Amazon's rental process to be easy, and the video quality to be very acceptable. It wasn't phenomenal video quality, but the movie having been filmed in the early 90's wouldn't exactly lend itself to outstanding video quality when viewed High-Def over the internet, would it?<br /><br />I'll likely rent videos again from Amazon, and will definitely watch Sneakers again, so it's a win for both.
B0014JLYPQ|5.0|Love these, they are a little more sturdy that the usual ones. They have been made for a working shoe and the bottom has a better grip too meaning they do not slip on wet like the others. I have had problems with my feet from a little girl, I have been in and out of many doctors had many special shoes made etc... and nothing would work I would get cramps and pains no matter what if on my feet for more that 40 mins till I found Crocks. I can do  6 hour on my feet with no pain its really a miracle. For those that have Metatarsal problems of any kind these are Amazing. I would recommend to any one. Love them.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Fun, beautiful, and I really appreciated that it has a walkthrough built into the game. Nice puzzle game all around.
B007MDB71O|4.0|I always mean to review a movie, but never make time. This movie deserves some love. I was curious about John Carter when it was released. Then I heard and read the terrible reviews. But, I figured it would do well regardless. I had no idea it would \\"bomb\\" at the box office. It still made a lot of money. But, cost a lot as well. To redeem myself, I rented John Carter and just finished watching it.<br />Wow. Pretty amazing film. The Edgar Rice Burroughs character of John Carter and the world he has his adventures is not an easy undertaking. I read the books when I was very young and forgot a lot, honestly. But, I do remember how cool it was to read an early 20th century author's take on science fiction.<br />Now mind you, the movie is not perfect. The CGI Tharks remind me a lot of the blue people in Avatar. Behavior. Not neccesarily in looks. The motivation of John Carter and how quickly he adapts to his new surroundings is striking. It gets a little unwieldy at the end, But, wraps up quite nicely. Maybe too nicely. These are a series of books however.<br />It's unfortunate if Disney decides not too take second go-around with John Carter. Many viewers probably had no idea that the world John Carter inhabits, predates Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Avatar and all the other sci-fi/action film it was compared to. This movie had a good story, great action and pretty good acting. and a bit funny (the \\"Virginia\\" joke cracked me up through the whole movie).<br />Over all, a great movie experience....enjoyed at home on my HD TV with my surround sound system. I TRULY regret NOT seeing this in the theatres.<br />Give it a shot.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|On its 15th anniversary, The Game has been given its best treatment ever by the good folks at The Criterion Collection - it's never looked or sounded better!<br /><br />I missed this movie in the theaters in 1997 but saw it immediately upon its video release and it instantly became one of my favorite thrillers.  Michael Douglas is spot-on as an emotionally detached, wealthy investment banker given an unusual birthday gift from his younger brother.  I actually prefer this performance over the similar but more bombastic role of Gordon Gekko.  As Nicholas Van Orton, Douglas gets to breathe a full range of emotion into his character and he really makes the most of it.  Sean Penn is great as usual as Van Orton's unstable brother Connie and Deborah Kara Unger turns in a strong performance as a mystery woman who may or may not be on Van Orton's side.<br /><br />Where to rank this among David Fincher's other great films is hard to say (it's my 2nd favorite) but I would say that it is the most overlooked.  I don't know if that's because of the simplistic name of the film, how it was marketed or something else entirely but like The Shawshank Redemption, it seem seems to be one of those films that most people discovered far beyond its initial release.  Having just watched it again, I was delighted to see that it had not aged a bit - something that cannot be said of other films of the 90s which are already showing their age.<br /><br />As I said, the film has never looked better.  It was never given very good treatment on video as it was (and that's being charitable) but this version hits it out of the park.  The dark scenes that dominate the film are more clear than ever and Fincher's use of colored light has dramatic impact.  Special features include 5 major set detail pieces exclusive to Criterion, trailer, teaser and audio commentary from all the principals throughout.  It also includes an alternate ending that I'm thankful they didn't use.  If you're a fan of this film, this Criterion release is essential.<br /><br />Lastly, a little about the plot itself.  There's not much that can be said without ruining the film's twists and turns but I cannot agree with the films few detractors who found it \\"too clever\\" or worse, those to whom it didn't make sense.  Watch it again; it's pretty much all there within the scenes & the dialogue.  Can you poke holes in parts of it?  Of course you can, but I've yet to see a film where that is not the case - life itself has lapses of reason.  What I like about The Game is that it does a more than adequate job of providing a tether to reality while it creates a mysterious world of its own - as long as you're willing to play along.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a awesome game if you like temple run you will like subway suffers. I love it so much and it always works on my kindle fire

Nexus 10 has latest version of Android. Go to Win7 PC and run Kindle PC app and all is well. Is there a new update for the Android version??? Probably going to switch to Google Store and reader.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Got me hooked from the first chapter. This is not my type of reding, but i really enjoyed it. I was up all night
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like the game. The only problem is you have to wait to be able to play after your lives have run out. You can buy more lives but it takes a lot of playing to earn enough coins to buy the lives yourself and I'm not asking for lives from someone else. The game itself is fast paced and fun.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Just what one would expect from Joe Abercombie, the book can stand alone but its best if you have read the blade is first trilogy and even the books dealing with Costa the mercenary and/or shivers first.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is an AMAZINGLY, AMAZINGLY AMAZING game. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it. It is the best game in the WORLD.
B005LAII08|3.0|Pixar is amazing, I'll watch anything they make because I have an incredible appreciation for animation and art.<br /><br />That said, this is one of their worst films to date. The story is incredibly familiar, like five old Disney movies mashed into one; except, there's no climax to the story, it's just a goofy Saturday morning cartoon script stretched over an hour and given amazing production values. It even bores my 3-year-old niece.<br /><br />Also, the 3D is really boring. There's really not much depth here, and the 3D is almost completely and totally unnecessary. Halfway through the film I had forgotten it was even in 3D.<br /><br />This one is a pass... but thankfully Finding Nemo 3D will be here soon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so fun I like temple run and this game is just like temple run you need to get this game ohh and you can have this game on your phone Wichita is even better
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really enjoy this book. I will stay it is not as great as the first book. However, I love the main characters. Eve is such as spice cake. I love that she doesn't take shit from Gideon. Yet, Gideon doesn't allow Eve to power him. They both are a great match. Unlike Anna, from 50 Shades, Eve doesn't just go along, and inturnalizes everything. If she doesn't agree with something, she speaks her mind. The balance between the sex and plot is still great. However, the constant braking ups and dialog that Eve share with her best friends and other characters in the book seem to long and drawn out. Lastly, I which the author would get to the problem with Gideon. Unlike Christian from 50 Shades, I don't think Gideon problems or problem is that deep. Just end the book already.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|This book is not up to Lee Childers previous Reacher novels.  It seems that Mr Childers had grown bored of his central character when writing this one.  It does not have the &#34;punch&#34; -  literal and figurative - that the others carry. I was disappointed.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|I think this game is great for kids to learn there puzzle skills on and great for children to play games.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|Someone complained to me after this released that you could &#34;see the scratches in Vader's helmet.&#34; I think that's the point. Would a war general not have some battle scars? Definition is the name of the game for Blu-ray releases, and the fact that you can see those details is what makes this release great. What isn't great is the annoying CG alien musicians added by Lucas in the 90's, but the rest is fine. I also think they tweaked the Solo/Greedo scene to reduce the time between shootings, but I can't be sure.
B003L77GRY|4.0|I want to start off by saying I have been a huge Dexter fan since season one and have even read the books. I wont even go in to how good this season is because it needs no explanation, its a great one. My only gripe is that it starts to do the things that I think actually led to the downfall of this series later on but if this was the last season of Dexter I would have been happy and thoroughly satisfied with the writers and the series but alas they had to start kicking a dead horse.<br /><br />What this season did wrong it only did wrong because it wasn't the series finale. I guess what I am trying to say is its this season were I started to feel like \\"Man a lot of stuff happens to Dexter and his family, and nobody generally cares\\"... Yes the plot twists do keep coming but I am sure we are all starting to feel like if this was a real city in Florida then everyone should move because they have a serious serial killer problem, and quite possibly the most naive police force in the country. Like I said if this was the last season it would have been a great end cap but even during this season the amount of stuff that happens to a lone blood spatter annalist and one city starts to become mind boggling.<br /><br />What the series starts to do this season is it takes away the realism, and as I wont give up the end it is the start to what I see as the writers sacrificing story and realism to keep the show going at all cost. The way I would have ended this season would have been much like it felt like it should end and the series with it.<br /><br />If your a Dexter fan and want to love the whole series my advice is make this the last season you watch as the title suggests... you get the picture.<br /><br />I give this 4 stars and I will say its a must for any Dexter and or Drama fan to watch this season, it does everything that makes this series great and more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the entire trilogy. I read all 3 books 10x each. I love the development of the characters. Yes, the author over does some of the characters saying, but l feel it is intended because the author is trying to build a human trait or should say personality. I know some people feel that Christian is abusive, but I say give me a brake. All the characters that Christian slept with were consenting adults. They just were dick whipped. Besides all that, the book kept great balanced in sex, story plot, and theme. As a reader you never get lost within the sex scene and lose sight of the story. The plot of this book is like no other. Most book talk about love lost then found or trying to get the other character to notice them . No,not this book, crime, passion, and suspense leave the reader in love. I can't wait for the movie.
B000W745CU|5.0|I had the full set of Harry Potter movies. I was a little bummed as my wife and I were re-watching them in order then I discovered that someone had borrowed this one and didn't return it.  I was able to find it on Amazon at a good price, and quick delivery.  I received a new disk with a clean recording. I now have the complete series again so we are back on track to Hogsworth.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Nice flashlight app.  Two modes and option to change the color of the screen light.  Also like the homepage widget... much nicer than having the app icon.
0061474355|5.0|Sabriel is the first of three books (with more to come) taking place in Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom. The Abhorsen is the person responsible for making sure the dead stay in Death and preventing necromancers from using the dead for evil purposes. When Sabriel's father, the current Abhorsen, goes missing, Sabriel must take up the title and find him. Along the way she gets help from the sarcastic Mogget, a Free Magic creature in the guise of a cat, and Touchstone, a young man imprisoned by a Charter Magic spell, as she encounters more danger than she could ever have imagined.<br />Garth Nix's writing style is second to none. He's created a fascinating world down to the last detail. Interesting characters, wonderfully described places, surprising plot -- I could go on and on. This is the book that made Garth Nix my favorite author and I highly recommend it.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|I am not a fan of bikers and their loud vehicles, nor am I normally into &#34;crime&#34; shows/movies, but Sons of Anarchy gets it right. Everything about this show is top-notch: the actors, the music, the camerawork, the writing.. on the whole this is one of the best shows on TV (at least seasons 1-4). Check it out on Amazon Instant Video for free if you don't believe me...<br /><br />The Blu-rays have a few features with behind-the-scenes, extended episodes, and commentary. Totally worth it.
030759565X|2.0|I am a fan of the Smitten Kitchen blog and had this book on my wishlist as soon as I heard about it. However I find myself disappointed. This is partly a reflection of the way I cook and partly a reflection of the concept of the book.<br /><br />The book, which as a cookbook is just fine - easy to follow recipes and photos and whatnot - details 100 new recipes. And this is partly what causes the problem. I was hoping for the best recipes from the blog in a book form, because I like books. If you like using the internet and printing out recipes, well that's fine and you probably have them all printed out and stuffed in a drawer. So the pressure was on to find new recipes I guess, and I found myself underwhelmed by them.<br /><br />I don't like sweet stuff particularly so a good 2/3 rds of the book is not my thing, and really, who needs more pasta recipes? So I find myself interested in only two of the chapters and the recipes in those are just not that thrilling quite frankly - two roast chicken recipes? Seriously?<br /><br />I'm not saying this is a bad book and you shouldn't buy it. I'm just saying that maybe this is a good book for started cooks and that the seasoned cook probably won't find a lot of creativity within.
0547884591|5.0|This book continues Tim's line of great books.  It teaches methods to learn rapidly and also teaches you to cook.  I've cooked more nice dishes in less time in the last week than I have in months before reading this (I'm only halfway through it).  Keep 'em coming, Tim!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Smart, original (well it was), and thrilling.  Any intellectual man or woman would love this novel. blah blah blah blah
B001NLKXK2|5.0|A well written book that was easy to understand on a topic that frightens everyone.  Lisa Genova describes her main character with clarity..  I cried through the book but I never wanted to put it down.  I hope that other readers learn about the terrible path Alzheimers can take and are able to treat their loved ones with the caring that Alice's children showed her.  Bravo to this author for a read that was informative,while being fiction, and a tenderness towards her main character that I found to be heartwarming.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Haven't received yet but as long as it is Susan Boyle I know it will be wonderfu. She has such a beautiful strong voice. I love everything she does.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I love it. Hours of fun and excitement.  Can't wait to play again.  So much fun.  I like to get 3 stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome game very challenging. wonderful music and scenery. recommended for all ages! the game feature a rain drop that moves around through obsticle courses.
0316227706|5.0|I am a huge dog fan and love books with picture of dogs in various situations, ones that are posed. You can't possibly pose these pictures! The whole book makes you smile. I bought a copy for my daughter in law too.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|This is Mary Shelley's best (only?) work. Originally titled &#34;The Promethean Man,&#34; this book is about grotesque science experiments into what many religious folks would call &#34;God's territory.&#34;  If you do not know what Frankenstein is about, then you probably don't care anyway, though.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This Anker external battery charger is a great product that most everyone with a cell phone or mp3 player could use. The 2 charging ports, at 2 Amps and 1 Amp, are great for either phones or iPods. The addition of a flashlight is just another plus. It has 4 indicator lights to let you know how much it's charged in 25% intervals. It charges by a side micro USB port. The fact it has 2 standard USB ports allows you to use any other 5 volt device's cable in addition to the 4 connectors provided.<br /><br />While the product itself is great, what makes this excellent is the additional add-ons included in the box. It has a mesh carrying case that holds all of the accessories and the main unit, which is key since you want to have the flexibility to handle any charging situation. It comes with 4 connectors, Apple connector (not the iPhone 5 one), micro USB, Mini USB, and a 5v barrel connector for other accessories. Between the 4 types, you should be able to charge pretty much any mobile device. The last plus that initially puzzled me is it actually comes with 2 different USB cords that accept the connectors, one is 70cm and the other 15cm. This allows you to charge two devices at once if necessary, a great feature.<br /><br />Overall, this is a GREAT value at $40, and comes with everything you need to make it useful for pretty much any 5 volt device. I give it a 10/10 rating, for being the complete package and having a full 8400mAh capacity in a compact and smart package.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but so far it's useless.  I never realized how complicated it could be to download one 3-minute video. Makes me sorry I bought a kindle rather than the nexus 7.
B007EDYN36|5.0|The last few bios I've read have been watered down and revealed nothing new.  Criss does a great job at laying it down for the fans.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I downloaded this and have had fun ever since.  It seems that it's never ending since they send more updates and more games to play.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I now know I can't ready psychotic thrillers. This book has me still scared. Which means she did an excellent job. Highly recommended.
0143118757|5.0|I was a business major and am currently in law school. This was a required reading for a law class but it should have been for one of my undergrad business classes.  GREAT book on negotiating agreements and settlements. I do not know why this book is not assigned as reading more often.  Some of it may be common sense, but for the most part I found it to be very informative on how to reach a settlement/agreement by getting past the parties' differences.<br /><br />In addition to helping one come to agreement with a difficult negotiator, it also helps one correct his/her own negotiation defects so as to be more malleable in settlement/agreement/contract talks.<br /><br />Buy this. Read it. Pass it on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was waiting for this app to come out on the kindle fire!!! I haven't downloaded it but this game is awesome!!!
B003CTWM16|1.0|bought this based on the good reviews but i guess i got a defective pool. bought in early spring and didn't inflate until summertime which was a huge mistake because i missed the return window of the seller that sold this item. when i tried to inflate, it never fully inflated -- not even partially -- and i tried various types of air pumps. contacted the seller but they wouldn't help due to it being outside the return window. i contacted intex directly and they were no help either. complete waste of money and a huge disappointment to my children.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|well I didn't think to backup the old one but I should have. What's with the size of all the amazon android apps?  they just keep getting bigger and bigger with every update.  The memory needs of this app are massive!  I have been forced to use the older smaller versions of the Amazon app store just because the current version is too DAMN BIG now to fit on my limited internal memory.<br />also why are these apps not APP2SD compatible?! I've been pushed into using titanium backup to force these apps to my sd card against there design. it works for the app store but doesn't save a whole lot of space. At 29MB's left I don't think I will be useing these apps in the future simply because they won't fit and at one point I'm sure the security of the old builds will be out dated and I won't be able to use the services.<br /><br />*edit* I stand corrected on the Kindle app app2sd... it moves now.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|As others have already stated, it crashes on second screen of the story introduction. Never actually got to the game! Reinstalled to no avail.
B0086213XW|5.0|A summer love story / drama worth watching with a bowl of popcorn. The characters are well written- consistently quirky, annoying, and cute...but in a very true to life kind of way. A good story...like an indie lifetime movie.
0525958002|3.0|Duran Duran was one of the biggest bands of the 1980's and bassist John Taylor gives readers and fans a peek at his musical influences, life in Duran Duran, and finding his own way. Expressive and poignant, John's story gets to the \\"heart\\" behind the man who continues to live a story we can all relate to.<br /><br />John opens the novel with life in Birmingham, England with his parents. Growing up, he was just a boy in the neighborhood, but when teenage John meets Nick Rhodes, the backbone of Duran Duran is formed. John and Nick pursue their dreams and soon the \\"boys next door\\" are founding members of one of the 1980's biggest rock groups.<br /><br />As John deals with fame, he comes to rely on fame's usual crutches, drugs and alcohol. His insights into the making of the first three Duran albums are a delightful treat for any fan.<br /><br />At the height of Duranmania in the 1980's the boy next door seems unrecognizable, surrendering to the music and drugs. John's story also offers hope that one can look adversity in the eye and overcome. He shares his choices, good and bad, and he shows us the humanity behind the man and his music.<br /><br />The book is easy to read and easy to relate to. Taylor talks about the height of Duranmania and the effects that fame had on him and his relationships. What I liked the most was his ability to relate a very human story behind the fame.<br /><br />\\"In The Pleasure Groove\\" gives you John Taylor, his way, his perspective. His story is highly entertaining, connecting on that \\"raw gut\\" level, just like Duran Duran's music.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Full of twists and turns. Incredible writing! I would recommend to anyone that loves a good thriller. It was a fantastic book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story had me on my toes as the storyline developed. Definetly a must read. When you get halfway through the book the story will totally turn on you and you fly through the pages trying to figure out  what happens.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Had to complete my collection! Looking forward to Part 2.  This movie dragged a little but explained a large part of the big story?
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought this for $20 for my father, a lover of science, travel, and photography.<br />He recently purchased a blu ray player and this would fit into his exclusive niche of interesting things.<br />He loves the videos and the narration is easy to understand being that English is not his first language.<br />The blu ray quality accentuates the beauty being portrayed by the series.<br />Watching my fathers eyes light up while watching the beauty of earth in 1080p was priceless.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I bought the first 4 seasons and this one is the best one so far.<br />If you watch the first season, everything revolves around Sheldon, Leonard and Penny, but now you see so many new characters that fit perfectly in this show and I love that there are more stories about Wolowitz and Bernadette :)<br />This show is so fun to watch !!!<br /><br />Find a girl for Raj already :( poor guy lol
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely love reading from the Kindle App.  Found books to be interesting and hard to stop once started.  Highly recommend.
B00846REIS|1.0|I loved 50 Shades of Grey and this was a pathetic copycat. I could never get into the characters and it was clear she copied 50's story. Not good.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I can't wait for book 3 to come out! This is a great trilogy since I was looking for something after the hunger games
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Fun puzzle game. I would have enjoyed it being a bit longer. I could have done without the built in walk through. It was just a little too tempting to check the guide.
B00846F1YW|3.0|this would be a good game but kicks me out at level 13...I have not had problems with this developer before ..I own a good many...downloading again...if problem not fixed may be last purchase from this developer....
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|really fun game.  don't know why its fun, really, but it is. word word word word word word word word
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I bought this app and its charged me and in my order history but never showed up in my Kindle and no way to request refund. RIP OFF!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This story hooks you from the first few pages. A sweet love story for anyone with a bit of fun drama too. Excellent!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I purchased the Linkedin App for my Kindle from Amazon.  Totally satisfied.  Just make sure you grab the right App.  Linkedin Blog is confusing.
B0009K7RU2|4.0|what's must I say more, this movie is an instant classic. I mean Predator, you have arnold and carl weathers in it trying to kill the thing that's haunting them. Its an awesome movie to watch on a roadtrip...
B007C7UZIG|4.0|This is a good tool to keep track and converse with freinds on steam.  Also, great for keeping up on latest deals and special offers.  Hoping they add a few more social options to this tool then would be great.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I love the good and evil...religion is an interesting and logical introduction. As a good show does, it makes you want to see the next season. ENJOY! Pure pleasure.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I thought this was going to be a fun movie with interesting interaction between Bruce Willis and Bill Murray, instead it turned out to be a movie on badly raised children doing stupid dangerous things.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Avenger was an amazing movie. To take iron man, Thor, captain America, and the Hulk movies & tie into to this amazing movie with all these great actors. They did an awesome job. As for the product I got the 3D blu ray from amazon on sale really great price. To take your girlfriend or wife to the movies to see something in 3D will run you $75 depending on if your cheap or you date doesn't like popcorn. Well I get to watch this in 3D in pjs & slippers on my reclining sofa with my bag of Doritos (don't like popcorn) & a cup of pomegranate juice. & eat real food if I'm hungry. Don't have to hear babies crying or people talking while movie is on & it will only cost me the price of this movie.<br /><br />Plus it's my house my food in the kitchen is paid for. So it's free. & you can ways cuddle up on the sofa with a blanket. Romantic!!!!!!! For her. For me shoot!!!!!! I get to see avengers.  Awesome.
0307389839|5.0|While I'm not a runner, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Murakami's treatise on the way running is part of his writing and writing part of his running. His obsession with running seems akin to madness on first glance; however, it's probably the same type of obsession that makes him an excellent writer. He doesn't give up. He wrestles--with words, with his legs, with himself. As a writer and a swimmer, I could easily relate to this text. More importantly, I came to appreciate Murakami's careful and effective writing style even more than I had before.
B005ZUR724|4.0|its was a blast but there's something that bugs me we paid $6.99 for this app and in 3 months there asking for more money WTF what do we do when that day comes they don't let u play?
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Cute story suitable for the whole family! Should have seen it earlier than I did!  What are the yellow guys?
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|love it. but it needs an update. the sop keeps force closing on me. it also freezes on the energy bar and when that happens everything I do is not there when I close it and reopen. please fix glitches.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|A fun set of stars with interesting interactions between them.  The special effects are great.  The action was fast.  Hope they make a sequel soon.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I was a big fan of this show in the first season, but WOW it got better in the second season!  As an academic, theorist, and general member of the audience, I have to say that it is spectacular and worth the money I spent to stream it!
0062101897|5.0|My sister has been a confirmed Harry Potter fan from the beginning. McCabe's text was the perfect gift for her because it takes the reader behind the scenes, illustrating interesting moments and decisions and celebrating the film series with luscious illustrations. The book is a must for die-hard HP fans everywhere.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|Jesse Eisenberg, definitely the role of his career for sure. He was great, actually so was the rest of the casting. I think this movie was slow in some parts but those parts were also critical to the telling of the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game eeeeeeevvvvvvvveeeeeeerrrrrrr !!!! I would totally by this game again again and again so buy this awesome game now
0385535147|2.0|I read somewhere that authors are paid by their publishers for x-number of books within a specific timeframe. Clearly Grisham was pushed to produce a text to satisfy a timeline. This book is sorely lacking in detail and believability. It truly resembles perhaps an outline of a book that he didn't have time to redraft. Wow, I wish he had spent more time on developing more likable characters and the delicious details that bring the work to life. Instead we have complete facial altering surgery and recovery in only a short time and multiple airplane flights and endless driving. I gave it two stars only because the complexity of the story line did keep me reading.  I will warn you though that the ending is completely stupid.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Simple, lots of fun. Great for the whole family. All of our friends enjoy it as well. Haven't tried the expansion, but don't feel the need to.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|the best show on tv. not just about zombies but the relationships people have in harsh times when they are thrown together. I have actually cried this season. something I dont usually do for a tv show.Hate to see the mid season break come.
B005LAIIFS|4.0|Reimagine Santa with a Russian accent and sleeve tats, the Easter Bunny with lethal boomerang skills, and a Tooth Fairy and a Sandman to match. Pit them against the evil Bogeyman, in his attempt to replace them all and permeate the world with his own dark influence. Now throw in Jack Frost - the unknown, suddenly promoted from the minor league.<br /><br />Well, it's enough of a premise for an exicting kiddie flick, with plenty of heroics and very little in the truly frightening vein. Happy ending, of course. Not much for the grownup who paid for the tickets, though.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B002BJGYTY|5.0|I never can complain about Gilmore Girls.  This season may be one of the best with big transitions happening in both Rory and Lorelai's lives. SEE IT!
0061474355|5.0|\\"Sabriel\\" and her half-sister novels, \\"Lirael\\" and \\"Abhorsen,\\" remain my favorite fantasy novels of all time. Yes, indeed that does place them above J.R.R. Tolkien's dauntingly detailed doorstops and J.K. Rowling's truly tantalizing titles. Why do I hold Sabriel in such esteem, you ask? I answer:<br /><br />The originality in the concept of the series is undeniable. \\"The Abhorsen Trilogy,\\" as the three tomes are called en masse, detail the travels and tribulations of the Abhorsen; the antithesis of a necromancer, the Abhorsen is charged with laying the dead to rest with the use of seven powerful bells. The freshness of utilizing music to combat the forces of destruction, combined with a new take on the zombie novel and with subtle spell work that does not become the plot, make for a hardy-smelling brew of excitement and intrigue. Much modern fantasy makes use of old and tired archtypes, critters, and magics, but Nix keeps it fresh with a new lore the reader is left dying to explore and asking for more.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for an adventure with some new sights and some new smells, give Sabriel a try.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|Okay. Here is why there is so much disagreement here. I am on my second set and yes, most of the discs are slightly warped, and yes a few of the sides are slightly off- center. However, the sound is just amazing. I know that they are from the recent digital remasters, but there are some differences, and to me these sound superior. The bass is deep and crystal clear. The vocals are amazing. There is very little surface noise, and it sounds much more natural.<br /><br />I have bought many 180 gram audiophile discs by other artists and most of them track much better, with no warping, so yes, by comparison, I am disappointed. But if you put on these records and just listen, they sound fantastic. So I guess it comes down &#34;what you see&#34; versus &#34;what you hear&#34;. I've decided to go with what I hear.<br /><br />The other issue is how badly you want this box set. If you're an avid collector you probably already have these on vinyl and might want to stay with what you already have. If you don't already have them on vinyl, you're going to be more forgiving of a few minor flaws, especially if the sound is all you hoped for. My first set did have a few audio flaws, but the second one (which I received in 24 hours) is much better.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i like it. it's one of the few note-sync'ing app that support blackberry among other platforms. i have it running on my pc, bb 9900, kindle fire, kindle fire hd, and bb playbook.<br /><br />2013-04 Addendum: My wife is an Evernote-convert now. She has quite a collection of recipes on Evernote.
B002RKSZS0|3.0|The first portion kept my interest, but it did not move along and keep me anxious to find out what was going to happen next, like the last portion did. It was almost as it the first section was written and then put aside for a time, before she wrote the second portion. It was a good read.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Sean Connery defined the original Bond: as much playboy as civil servant, and always quick with a quip. Half a hundred years later, Daniel Craig redefines the character - grittier, darker, and a lot tougher. This new entry in the Bond canon develops that character further, digging deeper into his past and into the political realities squirming behind any government agency.<br /><br />Dame Dench does an outstanding job, again, as M. Chase scenes work well, but don't have the central place they've had in other Bond flicks. The exploding-everything ending is as good as any, though, and comes across with a more personal feel than any other to date. And Naomie Harris keeps the Bond Girl tradition alive, strong, and looking very good.<br /><br />Now well past the twentieth movie in the franchise, you might expect some serious sequel slump. It's not happening, though. Craig's Bond has rebooted the series, and it's up and running better than ever.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B002BJGYU8|4.0|I always love this show and with this being the second season, there's definitely a lot ore character developing and fun. Not too much heaviness as Rory is at a new school and Lorelai figuring things out with Suki for the Inn and new Inn. Definitely recommend.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Most confusing menu! Please get it straightened out so that the customer can actually use this app. Please, please, please, please.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good time mgmt game. so far the game provides good instructions so you know what to do and you never feel lost.
B00006HBCR|5.0|On this disk there are songs that are not on the American Release disk. A definate must have for all Def Leppard Fans. Either for yourself of the Def Leppard fan in your life.
B009G7ZYPY|1.0|I tried playing the CD and tracks 4&5 do not play at all. Upon looking aty the CD, I found several deep scratches in it. I lost my receipt for this CD but would like it replaced at no cost to me.....I think this is only fair. I will return the other CD if necessary.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I looked forward to reading this as a long time King fan, but I kept finding myself thinking sections could have easily been cut down without losing the essence of the story.  I'm glad I read, but can't recommend - it just went on forever.  And ever.  Phew.
B002BWP49C|5.0|The acting has definitely gotten better throughout the movies and this one by far the best. Special effects were good, directing, locations. Can't wait for the final one to be released.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I got this season for my husband after having watched Season 1.  He just can't get enough!  I love it, too!
B008DYZKQE|4.0|The story is good and fun.  The only problem is that you can't change the size of the font.<br />The story should be read to all little girls.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Watched this show faithfully with my Mom every day after school.  Thought they did an excellent job capturing the &#34;spirit&#34; and updating it to be contemporary.  Really loved it!
0345803485|5.0|I found it a very interesting book.  It was fiction but had many parellels to how life with powerful men could be.  Women often find the &#34;bad boy&#34; image attractive but struggle with their personal beliefs and morals when interacting with men of this type.  It was a very dirty book but one I enjoyed reading as I found the woman the hero as she didn't lower her standards as she negotitiated her way through this relationship
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Characters blend together believably.  I look forward to each episode.<br />I can easily watch episodes a second & third time.
B003L77G06|4.0|When is this show not funny? Well not as much as the first season but definitely has some knee-slappers.  I'm not sure if the writers are already running out of &#34;real life&#34; to inspire the show but we'll see where this second season takes us !
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy no brainer game to play when I am trying to unwind after a busy day or while &#34;waiting&#34;, something I don't do well.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Sabriel is probably one of my favourite books ever written. I've never read a book that was so cleanly written and made me believe so firmly in the words I was reading that I was afraid to put the book down. I kept turning and turning the pages, frightened something was going to happen while I wasn't looking. I'd lean forwards in my chair, heart racing, speeding through the lines, flipping pages, so worried for the protagonist- it was crazy. I also peg my ridiculous fear of zombies on Garth Nix, as nothing frightened me more than reading about his hordes of undead. An amazing book, and amazing read by an amazing author. Clear, strong characters, diction that gets your heart racing and an entire world as real as the one I sit it. Sabriel is a book I've read so many times and loaned to so many people the poor thing hardly has a spine anymore. It is the most read book on my shelf, right beside Dianne Wynne Jones \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\". Thank you Garth Nix, for writing something so amazing that inspired me to pursue my hobby of writing.<br /><br />A definite favourite book. It's hard to put down, and I never get tired of revisiting the Old Kingdom.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|I enjoyed this original edition very much.<br />I found that ad for Japanese translation edition carried in some Japanese news papers said that Theodore Boone series are for junior (teen ager). I was very shocked to see it. The contents are very serious for me (well grown up).  However,<br />it is very nice there is no scene for sex and cruelty.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|The contents of this story will stay with me. We all know similar characters in our lives .  War as it always does brings out the best and worst in people. The  castle proves tobe friend, foe, lover, antagonist, and always secret keeper of all events. I loved this amazing story  and highly recommend.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|I also felt there were a lot more inappropriate parts for children in this movie then the first 2. My family found this one boring.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I'm obviously a little late to getting this DVD. It's a great show, one for women AND men. Zooey is hilarious along with all of the cast mates. HIGHLY recommended.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i like the editing tools a lot and there easy ti use! sharing your pica is is also cool. made a few collage and sent them to people as cards
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story is creepy and I think unrealistic. Too much sex but it kept me interested. It is a lovely love story but the sex is too much.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It caused many emotions in my chest. I laughed, cried, gasped. I never wanted it to end. This book reminded me of how blessed my life is and how lucky I am to be healthy and smart.<br />I loved it
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game.  I love the twist on the classic mahong quest.For the price it's even better, good graphics, lots of different puzzles.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|after hours of going thru walkthru over and over ... all steps working great up to autumn puzzle which won't work.  i am sure i could complete the puzzle but buttons are inactive.  bummer that i spent the time and have to abandon it.  glad it was free.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Bought this initially to use with WoW (World of Warcraft) and have not been disappointed. Setting it up with Wow though and using it effectively does require at least one third party add-on (in my opinion). That add-on is Bartender4 (which you can find at Curse.com or WoWaddons). I set it up so that the action bars mimicked the keyboard exactly, which isn't too difficult, but getting the buttons on the UI in wow to change when I press the shift button (thus giving me 44 buttons) was a little bit more difficult. You will need to go to the paging settings in Bartender and select a bar that isn't being used in the Shift drop-down box, you may want to enable that bar so that you can place your abilities in it (you can then un-check enable and it will still pop up when you hold shift).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|hey!This game is a lot like temple run but is way better. you are not being chased by mo keys
B007THA4FI|3.0|Too many characters are introduced at the beginning and it is difficult to follow the plot otherwise the book became very interesting towards the end.
B000068R1X|1.0|Do not buy the 2002 remaster version of Bark at the Moon.  Only buy the 1995 remastered version.  The producer ruined an Ozzy masterpiece and the improved volume is not worth the loss of all the background sounds that make the album a great.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is now my favorite book! I thought that I had one for quite some time, but now I KNOW. How did the author get me to go from complete elation to a quivering, slobbering mess (but in a good way),in just three pages?! Do not stop or pass go until you read this book. You'll thank me for it later:)
B0073LWEXK|5.0|First of all, this Game isn't a waste and this is the first product I ever reviewed; and this product deserves to be recognized for what it deserves. It really challenges your investigation skills, with the puzzles, notebooks, pieces, and other items you collect throughout your adventure. Every item you obtain is a clue either to continue or at the further of the end. I know this because I've beaten this although they're hint guides (I don't know what this does due to the fact I want to see if I can beat this as if this was real) if you want an adventure keep looking and thinking and don't give up. For example, when you're doing a puzzle, a hint can be found in the notebook or what you've seen and what make sense. If you found a piece, use your deductive reasoning such as items where they belong. And, some of the puzzles, are just straight out puzzles where you just fit the pieces. Remember this, every item in the game has a reason to be there. Don't give up and you will find the promise land.<br /><br />Good Luck!<br /><br />I know this isn't much of a review but most of the reviewers got it right and truth be hold I wasn't playing this game just for graphics, since I was really into it, and I know you will be and be surprised what you might find.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Alvin & the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked is really good.  You know, I'm surprised just how good it is.  As a kid of the 80's I loved the cartoon.  I loved the mischievous adventures that Alvin would get into.  I loved the way he'd always get under Dave's skin.  I loved the renditions of popular 80's songs such as the Cars \\"Shake It Up\\" and Madonna's \\"Material Girl\\", but these current movies are probably even better.  They step up the excitement level a few more notches.<br /><br />This one is about Alvin and the gang getting stuck on a desert island after floating away on a kite.  Dave and their crooked manager from the previous films makes a return, and he's actually fairly tame, friendly, reasonable and likeable this time around.  The female chipmunks return as well.  Perhaps the only complaint I have (besides all the cheesy singing and dancing) is the constant need for the chipmunks to sing current music from the likes of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber.  These songs won't last over the long term and therefore won't be remembered several years from now.  The writers should stick with the classics instead.<br /><br />Anyway, when the chipmunks have to fend for themselves on a deserted island, this is when all chaos breaks loose.  They meet a woman who's been there for 7-8 years and well, she's mentally unstable and clearly lost her marbles!  She's there because she's on a quest for gold.  Meanwhile the chipmunks just want to be rescued.  They worry that Dave might not be coming, but... will he?  You'll have to watch it to find out!<br /><br />Overall, pretty solid jokes (though a little more childish this time around) and great storytelling and entertainment for the entire family guaranteed (if you're a chipmunks fan, that is).  Perhaps the relationship between Alvin and Dave is more sentimental than usual as well.  Isn't Theodore just adorable?  Yes!  And the heroics of Simon as a result of a spider bite?  You'll understand what this means when you watch the film, haha.
B004X80QNG|4.0|I got this app as a FAOTD a while back when I was still using a Motorola Droid 1. At the time, I was glad it was free because it was a kludgy mess. I've decided to give it another try with my new devices and I couldn't be (much) happier. My only complaint is that Google Tasks don't sync. As far as Google Calendar (events) and Google Contacts (people) it works perfectly.<br /><br />FOR THOSE COMPLAINING THAT THE APP DOESN'T SYNC WITH GOOGLE CALENDAR: The app discovers and syncs with whatever (relevant) accounts you have on your device. As far as i know, Kindle Fire doesn't allow for a google account. This is a problem with your device, not the app. On full-fledged Android devices, the sync feature works perfectly.<br /><br />Bottom line: 4 stars for now and 5 when the devs get over their &quot;PI Cloud&quot; idea and allow GTasks sync. $10 is enough without trying to charge a subscription fee to sync tasks (something other apps do with Google flawlessly.)
0374214913|4.0|What a rollicking nerdy fantasy! Three-story bookshelves, gorgeously bound old books, madcap capering in a vast underground Library, a yarn museum, risotto, a boob-simulation empire, and a guy named Deckle. Swoon.<br /><br />OK-ish writing and a hero that is upstaged by his quest buddies, from his stage-building roommate to his archeologist coworker, to the cast of loveably obsessed old puzzle solvers.<br /><br />But!!!! The cover absorbs light from the bedside lamp and then glows in the dark!!!!!<br /><br />Made my typography-geek heart very very glad. Four stars only because I wish they'd included the \\"A Note on the Type\\" page.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I loved the quality of the picture and sound.  I also liked i was able to watch where ever and for 24hrs
1932100660|5.0|The book will convince you for a diet of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Personally though, I think a tiny bit of organic egg (like one per week) and tiny bit of small wild fish probably won't hurt.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|This cat is so cute. It's gonna be a birthday gift for my little sister. At first I thought &#34;wow it's small&#34; but then I recognized how fluffy and soft it is!
B004QL7K70|5.0|Project X is not a 5-star movie.  I'm sorry for giving it the highest rating a product can receive on amazon.  However, let me explain my case so you don't think there's something wrong with me.  I've seen *countless* teen party movies over the years and NONE of them are entertaining at all.  They are nothing more than filler and a waste of movie space.<br /><br />Project X... FINALLY, a party movie that actually lives up to the hype!  These teens are on a mission to create the absolute biggest, baddest party ever designed.  They of course, are interested in sex, being cool and just being really rowdy, however what happens is that this party eventually spins *completely* out of control.  As the movie rolls along, you will probably be sitting there totally amazed at just how many creative ways this party turns into pure insanity.<br /><br />Seriously, you will never want to see another party film involving teenagers ever again because this one set out to accomplish every single nook and cranny you can possibly provide and make it MUCH better than all the rest.  It makes all the rest no longer relevant, in fact.  It really works.  I don't even want to spoil any of the ways these teens get into trouble and what they do.  They go from the uncoolest kids in school to the coolest in one night, that's for sure.  Alright alright, I'll spoil one moment.  While the one teen is talking to his father upstairs on the phone and assuring his father that everything's alright at home and that he's not causing any trouble whatsoever, a huge explosion occurs right outside the window!<br /><br />It's hilarious because the entire time I was wondering how the kids would clean up by morning so their parents wouldn't find out what happened.  None of that even matters and you'll find out why, haha.<br /><br />It's rowdy, offensive, provides plenty of swearing and nudity, and it's completely inappropriate for children.  However, for one 80-minute movie and a night of adrenaline-pumping fun,I recommend purchasing (or renting, if you understandably don't trust my words) what will forever be, the king of party films.
0739341243|5.0|This should be mandatory reading for everyone from military leaders, teachers, business executives, etc. It will open your eyes about the untapped potential of some of the people in your daily lives, even in your family. We all have something to contribute and just because you know someone who is reserved or quiet, doesn't mean that they should be disregarded. Find a way to listen better and enable them to share more openly. This book is also an interesting comparison in cultural studies (eastern and western) as well.
044024630X|3.0|....and Amazingly Beautiful Women who eat lots of pie and cheeseburgers while staying Beautiful and looking the other way while the people who just need killin' are getting killed.<br /><br />I love Reacher and the series, but Lee Child has done his credibility and his hero a disservice with this book. Other reviewers have done an excellent job of highlighting the many technical inconsistencies, which are insulting, especially from an author of Child's standing. Hello, editors?<br /><br />Brutality, incongruous sex scenes, walking around all filthy in sweat soaked clothes that must stink and sitting down to eat? Seriously I was going \\"eewww\\" at Reacher every few pages.<br /><br />Reacher is mechanical and soulless in this thing, like some sort of Terminator robot.<br /><br />Ah, wait, I forgot. Child is living in a mindspace universe where Tom Cruise is the perfect Reacher. Never mind. Carry on, Child, go sit with James Patterson in the \\"Writers Who Are Done Giving a **** About Writing\\" bench.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|who could go wrong with Grisham?  I have read every book he writes and this one was really a dandy
0385535147|5.0|Great story informative, and a page turner.the sTory is fascinating and very informative.i loved it.i did not fall asleep reading this one
0345529057|4.0|All of the books are an interesting read. It's engaging enough that you continue to want to know what happens next, and the characters have depth, each with strengths and flaws that make them human. Throughout the series you find that there isn't much in the way of \\"plot armor\\" to protect people, which is good as well as bad. It was hard for me to get attached to any of the characters because who knows when or if they will die, and because you're reading about so many people at the same time. Also, the writing is so dense it's like you're eating bread pudding; you can't take too much in at one time. It's hard to read these book for hours and hours without becoming weary. There's also  A LOT of describing food that could have been left out. I feel like I read about dinner in every other chapter. Despite feeling a little disconnected from the characters, Martin still manages to evoke emotion from the reader. Overall, these books are entertaining and very well-done in a technical sense.
B0085776BG|1.0|Great picture and quality but halfway through the entire computer blacked out and I had to master restart it which took everthing off of my computer. I'm not sure if it was the quality of the computer or this but I still havent seen the rest of this movie and I am salty about that.
B009MO5960|1.0|Retribution: A punishment that is considered to be morally right and fully deserved.  That's the generally accepted definition of the word.  Which would lead one to believe that somewhere in the movie, someone, for some \\"morally right\\" reason, is being punished.  What the movie fails to address, however, is that the only people being punished are the viewers of this film.  An interesting titular meta-reference, but not a very interesting movie.<br /><br />Paul W. S. Anderson, presumably a 12 year old child with ADD and enormous financial resources, sat down with other cinema-minded individuals and began the painstaking process of pre-production for this film, which, based on the result, consisted of watching other hyperactive 6th graders play video games for five hours at a stretch.  Convinced he could bring some of that magic to the big screen, he then proceeded to set up a conference call with Uwe Boll and Michael Bay to discuss their own techniques for having the worst possible acting and dialogue interspersed with frenetic shots of people back-flipping over exploding cars while they fired machine guns with inexhaustible ammunition capacities in order to escape from a hi-tech installation for some reason.  \\"Paul,\\" they said, while riffling through the stacks of thousand-dollar bills they have lying about their Lake Como retreats, \\"that sort of thing has been done before, countless times, probably to the point of weariness.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ha Ha!,\\" countered Paul, \\"But has it been done with zombies?!\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes,\\" replied the filmmakers in unison.<br /><br />\\"Well, too bad, I'm going to do it anyway.\\"  And then they all concluded the meeting by making gunfire and explosion noises with their lips.<br /><br />To give you an idea of just how bad this movie is, consider for a second that Milla Jovovich, while by no means an unskilled actress, puts on a performance that is positively Oscar-worthy compared to the rest of the cast.  In fact, the little hearing-impaired girl who has 11 lines, out-acts everyone else by a factor of 10.  Based on the dialogue delivery, I honestly thought that at some point it was going to be revealed that all the characters in this film were, in actuality, robots programmed by a team of engineers that had learned the English language solely by watching middle-school drama productions.<br /><br />In any case, Anderson had both the Random Cliche and Plot-Contrivance Generators running at full tilt, and when they ran out of steam, he compensated by lifting sequences directly from Dawn of the Dead, every John Woo movie ever made (minus the doves), and even other Resident Evil movies.  That's correct, he actually used footage from Resident Evil: Afterlife as filler in this one.  I suppose that's one way to shave off dollars from the budget.  Hiring a stoned teenager with a digital recorder and a stack of 1990's-era video games to compose the background music is another.  For the first twenty minutes of the movie, I thought I had left a Playstation paused somewhere in the house.  Nope; that was the score.<br /><br />So what is to become of this franchise?  The first Resident Evil movie was actually quite good, if you're into the genre.  Ditto the follow up and the third.  It's been pretty much a downhill slide since then, and this movie proves that with a little digging, there's another layer underneath rock-bottom.  And Anderson wielded a mighty big shovel with this one.  I'm honestly hoping that some other filmmaker (no, not Boll or Bay) can take over the reins and resurrect this series and bring us Resident Evil: Reparations.  I think the fans deserve better than this.<br /><br />Skip it, and pretend it didn't happen, like we all did with the last Indiana Jones film.girl who has 11 lines, out-acts everyone else by a factor of 10.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|This an easy book to read written for the general public, not by scientists but by a journalist. It makes the language easily flowing. Importantly, it is obvious that the author had done huge survey and compiled great preart to concisely deliver the topic. All of the chapters are supported by interesting real stories. If you want to go in detail about a topic/chapter there are lots of very good references in the back of the book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put this down.  The whole 3 book series was so very good and just kept turning the pages as I could not wait to see where the story would go
B004RQDQIQ|3.0|I saw the film when it was first released.  What stayed in my recollection is the Irish music, fine cinematography, brutal violence and some very inventive set pieces.  This blu ray disc reproduced some of the beautiful scenes e.g. in the forest but failed to tone down the makeup which made all men wore red lipsticks.  22 years on, the film now looks a bit flashy with a hollow center.  It is mainly due to the lacking of deeper explorations or descriptions of the 3 main charactors, the 2 gangsters and Gabriel Byrne's charactor, critically the latter.  How good a right hand man was he?  Why was he so like by his boss, even after he betrayed him?  Was he really heartless or souless?  Are they simply small time hoods?  It is all very ambiguous.  For these reasons, it is not a fully satisfying period crime film.
B002QNBRXS|3.0|Enough already.  They need to call it quits.  This season the implausibility of the whole thing just came to a head.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love the characters! Great angry birds addition. If you like star wars you will like this angry birds. Must have for angry birds fans.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was recommended to me for my book club. It was worth the read. The characters were well developed and portrayed correctly. Couldn't put it down.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game because it is awesome. the only problem is that I have had to delete it several times because it would not open. anyways, get it!
B009CG2YDE|5.0|Awesome 8-bit game play. Brings back childhood memories. Tilt the device to move back and forth. Hold the screen to charge your shot and kill enemies in one hit.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Many writers have related various aspects of Lincoln's life from his boyhood to his assassination but few have had the credentials of an historian the rank of Doris Kearns Goodwin.  I've read a few Lincoln biographies before but never have I learned so much about the man and the times in such an agreeably entertaining manner.  In &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; Goodwin deftly intertwines the story of the privileged backgrounds and careers of William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase and Edward Bates, with an account of Lincoln's triumph over the hardships of his early life and his successes leading up to the presidential race of 1860.  This is the story of the political turmoil of the North in the decade prior to the war and how each man came to respect Lincoln for his leadership and intellect.  By 1865 the four men had endured the chaos of war to truly become a team of friends.<br /><br />The book presents not only a fascinating historical account of the times but Ms. Goodwin narrates the story so skillfully that you really don't, as is too often said, want to put it down.  I learned more from &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; about the antebellum era of American history than I ever dreamed I would!

B007THA4FI|2.0|So much of this book is drugs, sex and abuse.  I am disappointed. I had been looking forward to this book for quite sometime. Boo.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My whole family loves this movie.  It's witty, humorous and action packed.  The characters are great.  It's definitely worth owning.
B000T433CO|5.0|The Holiday is an excellent movie choice. Great actors, wonderful music, beautiful story line, and British accents. Nothing is better to put you in a great mood.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I love these type of games. great gfx and music and the story line is impressive. i recommend this to anyone
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This really is better than MIB 2. Great pace, awesome villain, you simply need to watch this if you like MIB. In some ways it reminded me of the cartoon series (I watched with my son), in that it is very inventive. I started the movie very, very, skeptically and quickly changed my tune. It was like, \\"aw...cool\\", \\"wow\\", and so on (sorry for the hippie vernacular, but it works well here). Will Smith does appear a bit tired, but wouldn't J be a bit cynical after a few years in the company? Much, much better than I anticipated, I am actually excited that they cared enough to do this one right. This has some amazing homage's after J travels back in time, it may take a couple of viewings. I spotted the Metaluna Mutant and Frank the Talking Dog...how many can you spot?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|E L James has created the unforgettable love story of  Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in her trilogy of FIFTY SHADES OF GREY. I have read these books three times and bought the audio version so I can enjoy it again while I exercise or go for my walks. It takes my mind off boring workouts. There is a melange of feelings that change through the series that explores child abuse, neglect, substance abuse, BDSM, erotica, naivete, trust and passionate love. You will fall in love with these characters and care about what happens even after the story ends.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|It changes your life completely! Just use your imagination!More positive thought, your smile ang it begin working. The more you realize it the more it works!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|There are many accounts that tell the setup for this novel.  I'd just like to say that by the end, I liked the characters so much that I was sorry to see it come to an end.  I will remember Harold, Maureen, Queenie, and Rex for a long time, holding them in my heart.  What a great author Rachel Joyce is!
B008DVJMAW|4.0|I have seen Blackberry Smoke with Zac Brown Band 3 times and enjoyed their music and show.  Even with that, The Whippoorwill exceeded my expectations.  I found the overall CD to be good, not just a couple of good songs.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Very informative book.  It does make sense as to why so many more people now have gluten intolerance.  I can see the connection with diabetes too.
B003IWRE3I|5.0|Grim and dark, just like the book. Three headlines from the day I write this review: 1. North Korea readies its second missile launch to determine viability and range of a nuclear strike. 2. China hacks the USDoD, which contains nuclear launch codes and more. 3. The US readies a remote, robot controlled fighter plane that can fly faster than a normal fighter jet can and murder with greater efficiency.<br />Trillions of dollars spent on death. With the tech of today, if people could just get along, we could provide food and shelter, etc. for the entire world. Instead we work on better ways to kill each other. I think this movie portrays what is going to happen to the world and mankind. It is well deserved. Maybe the earth can somehow recover without the pestilence of man around to destroy everything.<br />BTW, if you wish to really \\"get\\" this movie you must watch it until the end. If you do not you will be missing the life affirming final message that Mr. McCarthy meant to be conveyed.
0061474355|5.0|This book (and it's sequels) were books that I really enjoyed reading as a young adult.  Being in my 20's now, I still have them on my bookshelf and revisit them every few months or so.  The entire book is so different from anything else I have read before, and that's saying something!  It combines a lush and interesting setting with well fleshed out characters and a plot that will have you hanging on the edge of your respective reading surface.  It's amazing that these stories don't get more attention for how fantastic they are, but when you happen to stumble upon them it's like finding a hidden treasure for your imagination.  If I could give them six stars I would!
B0000BWVCM|3.0|2.5 to 3 stars at best.  While X-Men 2 was nowhere near as good as 1 & 3, it is still 1000 times better than Wolverine (ugh!).  Truth is, much of X-Men 2 was a total mess from a directorial and storyline standpoint, but hey, even a bad X-Men movie is better than none.
B000000I0H|5.0|Tubular bells was Mike writting at 15 years old... able to... and nearly mastered 53 instruments...known as the theme to The Exorsist... he moves on to keeping original works like this work...the song of Hiawatha will enchant you ...the Vibes uncanny... music to put on..rest your head and should you awaken enjoy its peace.  mike is truely a master at what he does and needs no ones assistance simply because he knows what instruments go with oneanother...ENJOY.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good game but sometimes it just goes too too slow!  But 4 the most part very additive. Just wish there were more coins n prizes.....
B0041KVW2K|1.0|This is great and all but I still have all my original Albums and including some collector ones from the Beatles but I guess it is great for those who do not have them and a few of mine are signed by Ringo Starr when I met him back in 2001 while he was visiting my neighbor across the street and took a picture with him..
B00A11AN6O|4.0|I use many different cloud storage programs and this is easy to use. Perhaps Amazon has just figured out what their clients needed and filled that gap.
B009IAIC5I|5.0|This is a great package for the Maiden fan on your list... the sonics are great and the packaging is also very cool. Every maiden fan needs to own this for their collection.
B003204MQS|5.0|Highly rated if you like scary movies, we enjoyed it thoroughly and my wife was creeped out for a few nights afterward.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I hesitated to read this because from I'd heard I thought it would be dark and depressing, but not all.  It was light and fun and even funny at times. I winced a few times, but smiled much more often. I will read the other two. I expect book three to leave us with happily ever after.
1451688091|2.0|THe Movie was Torture....too long... D.D. Lewis tried so hard it was painful to watch him do the basics...walk, talk etc. In spite of that I bet he wins an oscar for all that trying.... They could have knocked off 30 minutes and it would have been better...hoping this book is better.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My 9 year old has read the series and ask to watch this movie. All of my kids including my 5 year old enjoyed the movies. I would recommend it...
B0041KVXLK|4.0|I must say my favorite 2 Beatles Albums are the Sgt Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour products. I have to say I was pumped to get Sgt Pepper on vinyl again. The pre-reviews were amazing. I did receive this vinyl and the package is beautiful. The package is high quality and awesome. The heavy weight vinyl was as advertised. It does sound great..but...and I say this as a vinyl fan...the vinyl pressing is extremely noisy. Sad to say...I prefer the last issue to this one... and dare I say the CD.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|My entire family enjoyed this movie, but it is on the violent side. I liked how the major characters were brought together into one movie after their individual stories were told in their own movies.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|The item was shipped very quickly.  It is new and in package - The price was the cheapest I found.
B009369Z8A|5.0|Ok so ever since I saw the trailer I wanted to see this movie. Finally I rented it from redbox and as expected it was a great film! The story is put together well and written well also. The story is brutal as well as the images and the violence is extreme but that all makes the film work so well Of course with Tom Hardy, Shia Lebouf, Gary Oldman, Guy Peirce and the rest of the cast make this a winner and a must buy on blu ray. I will however wait until this comes down from the insane 29.99!
B007712XAU|5.0|I seldom watch something that is a &#34;continuing series&#34; while it is on television, because I hate missing even one show. Therefore, I had heard friends and family rave about Downton Abbey, but hadn't experienced it yet.<br /><br />The series is addictive. Great characters well played, lovely settings, and beautiful writing. Now I can't wait for more seasons. I'm even considering carving out the time slot to watch something this good when it shows up on PBS. Yes, it's THAT GOOD!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The book is amazing, once I picked it up I couldn't stop reading! I recommend it to anyone who likes a lot of action!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Pure fiction, a fun read, I kept the pages flipping on my kindle at max speed.<br />It's worth the money, so buy it and enjoy!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|They did a great job redoing the Lorax, i was skeptical at first but all around everyone of all ages will enjoy this remake.

B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle (Nathan Fillion) and Beckett (Stana Katic) are the &#34;Nick and Nora Charles&#34; of the modern era, but with a lot less emphasis on drinking. They WORK! They are smart and sassy, and perfect together.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|This may be one of the best Disney movies.  Great message for both girls and boys without being preachy or overtly politically correct. Just a kid who loves her family and her country.
B009HELT3C|4.0|We had fun watching this movie. They are some very funny parts :) it's a good option in general. :)
B008CPZNL6|1.0|I love Flipboard, but now with the last update it crashes within a few seconds of opening. Stopping the app in the app manager doesn't help, clearing the cash doesn't help, shutting down and restarting the Kindle Fire doesn't help.  Whatever they did in the last update has essentially bricked the app on the Kindle Fire.
1596912863|4.0|I had borrowed the audiobook from the library with low expectations. For audiobooks, I need a light read that won't give me stress while driving in traffic, and, being a Jane Austen fan, I thought this looked good. It was much better than I expected. An interesting premise of a single working woman given a trip to Jane Austen land where men woo the paying female clients. Jane goes through a period of self discovery while dealing with actors vying for her attention.<br /><br />I found myself unexpectedly caught up in the emotions of Jane as she went on this journey of self discovery, and rooting for her as she sorted truth from fantasy. Much more enjoyable than I expected; looking forward to reading her next Austenland book.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|A long-time Deftones fan, I own all of their albums and have quite a few b-side and rare tracks, too.<br /><br />This album is fantastic and is in constant rotation. The guys have done a great job yet again. I'm proud to have the deftones in my collection and as part of my personal soundtrack.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|This is definitely an adult series. Lots of violence, some language, but a very good representation of Rome in those days.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE Pinterest!!! So many ideas that it's easy to get sucked in for HOURS!!  Facebook was my old addiction...now: what's Facebook??
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a great game for people who love puzzle games. The strategies are great and the music is perfect for a stress-free game.
B005LZYL3G|5.0|Very interesting and informative. My husband is a huge Pearl Jam fan and he loved it! We lent it to a friend and she then purchased one for herself.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I enjoyed Gillian Flynn's books.<br />This book as well as Gone Girl takes you for a thrilling ride.<br />The characters are intense and smart.<br />I'm looking forward to the next one.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|It took less than 5 seconds for me to fall in love with this sultry singer.  Not only is her voice incredible, but the slow languid presentation is fantastic.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this game is super fun. I only wish it lasted longer. Please make more games thanks! :-) anyone who likes being alive will like this game.
1451648537|5.0|Bought this, as a Christmas gift,  for my 14 year old son and he really enjoyed reading this book about Steve Jobs.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I love this game. My mom and my 5yr old cousin love it. It's fun and easy to play. Great game.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|great book<br />Im reading books as they come in series  havent read breaking dawn yet but will rad it very soon
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I honestly refuse to live in a house without this book in it as well, and since I lost my last copy, I suppose it's a good thing that it was so cheap here. I've been rereading this book for going on ten years now and I haven't gotten around to getting tired of it, or even to not laughing too much while reading it. I'll just leave you with what I tell everyone about Good Omens- just shut up and go read it, you ninny. You'll enjoy the hell out of it. And if you don‘t? Well. Nerts to you, then.
B003FXXNBW|5.0|This movie has some of the best fight scenes ever. Scott Adkins is a incredible martial artisit and very fun to watch.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book. It was well written and a nice love story. I recommend this book to any one that loves a good romance.
B003O86FMW|3.0|a good read - clearly aimed at the younger people. One can see that a trilogy was always on the cards.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game easy to get lost in for hours recommend you buy this game and that you never stop playing it
B0073LWEXK|4.0|There aren't many games like this for kindle.  Not as complicated as Myst but it's similar.  I enjoyed it and recommend it.
B003B02O14|5.0|Suspected the ending but was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end.  Grisham weaved another superb legal nail-biter that does not disappoint.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Her books have never disappointed me.  As a criminal defense attorney I find the forensics fascinating and as a voracious reader I can never put her books down.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|poorly written, boring story. Dont know why I bought this. Cannot remember if I had looked at other reviews !
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I picked this up on Kindle because it was free and I was not disappointed. It was a good read about two characters whose past experiences with love and abandonment had made them cynical when it came to love. To an outsider, it seemed so obvious that Connor and Megan were meant to be, but they had so many personal demons to wrestle with and overcome before they could even try and understand what they meant to each other.<br /><br />There was only one missing piece, an epilogue. It would have been interesting to see them down the road a little. How it all really turned out beyond the ending that we got. But other than that it was a good read and I would recommend it, even if you have to pay a little something to read it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Awesome book. Could hardly put it down!<br /> Cant wait to start the next book. I must know what happens next!
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|How do you make a movie about the chaotic, intense, foolish, brilliant inner world of a teenager?  You make a chaotic, intense, foolish, brilliant movie.  Watching, I wrestled with the screenplay - surely this was a true story for someone, no one would sit in their armchair and make this up?  But my exasperation, I think, is a result of an absolutely brilliant screenplay that made me feel, rather than just told me, what this story is about. I remain disturbed, remembering the intense emotions of the movie, the morning after.
B00899E5B4|4.0|Pure Joe. I really enjoyed this album. He could have left off the wah wah tube. Just because you have success with something doesn't mean you have to stick with it forever.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a very good app. I have heard people plan their weddings with pinterest. I stayed up until 4:30 in the morning pinning pictures because it is so fun. I highly recommend you download this app right now. It really is worth it because there are no in-app purchases. I am in love with Pinterest.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game to play with the kids. i wish there were more coins and you didnt lose so much off the sides.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have a big three stone set for my standard edge knives but did not have anything for my serrated edge knives so I picked this up to keep a clean sharp edge on those knives. For use in that action, this is a great tool. It is well made, small and easy to carry with you anywhere. I highly recommend this product.
B006O6F932|4.0|I bought this school set for my 6 year old daughter for christmas because she is a huge monster high fan and wanted santa to bring this for her for christmas. The monster high school is a good size, you can fit 6 dolls at once, because there are three rooms in the school and 2 chair my itself and 2 long benches that can hold 2 dolls a piece. The school has a science room, cafeteria and bathroom area. This school is fairly easy to put together and comes with tons of accessories like jack o'lanturn,speaker box, food and drinks,locks for the lockers. spider webs, beakers, lockers, school desks, gargoles for the front door,stickers that child can stick any place they want to, disco ball and many more. The play set give you the option to fold it up or leave it out, which is a plus.  The set is pretty sturdy if you set it up right, the only promblem that I find is the steps seems to comes out of place sometimes, but my daughter know's how to put it back in place. I have had no promblem with the school learning so far. My daughter is having fun taking the dolls to school and ofcourse opening and closing their lockers. Overall this set is well design with so much details and beautiful accessories. Your little ones will love this, so make the investment.<br /><br />Alot of people giving this 1 star because they not setting this up correctly. There is a hand on the outside of  side wall of the science lab, you have to connected it to the caffeteria wall, or the deck where the boom box is will fell shaky. The only thing bad I will say about this set is the stair, it don't stay a place all the time.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Wife and daughter like listening to this, even though, as a man, I don't see how the book is associated with mentioned songs.  Nice classical music though.
B00144VBBS|5.0|Two discs of just pure Toby.  Such a talent---could listen to him all day.  Every Toby Keith fan should have this in their collection.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Outstanding game, works well on the gTablet. Gonna be an uphill slog to find a more beautiful GUI, screen control, and pure fun. So many of this sort require silly and fiddly puzzle solving, not this one. I'm 67, and could care less for running/shooting/finger dexterity games. This one is like a modern day Adventure/Colossal Cave. XYZZY!
B004LWZWGK|1.0|If the last Batman you saw was \\"The Dark Knight\\" I recommend stopping there because the story doesn't get any better. \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" was the longest 3 hours of a movie EVER. It's depressing, it lacks intensity and frankly you just want to run and hit Batman with his own cane.<br />Perhaps my criticism of this movie is masked because of the near perfection of \\"The Dark Knight\\" and the intensity of all characters involved: Batman, Rachel, Harvey Dent, Joker, even Commissioner Gordan was intense. This Batman just missed it... but watch it for yourself if you must, 3 hours you'll never get back.
B0087UN94E|5.0|This is a great cd neil and the guys having a good time, nobody does garage rock (or barn rock) like Neil young and crazy horse, can't seem to get it off of my player!!

B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Before I saw the movie I really didn't have high expectations for the music being much more than fun karaoke sounding versions of great 80s rock songs sung by the actors involved.  But once I saw it I wasn't just surprised at the high level quality wise of singing that Tom Cruise and the others could actually produce, but was so impressed with their versions of the songs I loved when a child, that I immediately went and bought the soundtrack. To use a term I would have used back in the 80s with the original artist's songs, this album rocks!<br /><br />The album is also great value for money, you get 20 songs on here, there aren't many albums released today that give you much more than 35-40 minutes of music.  Rock of Ages goes for just under 63 minutes.  The album insert gives you a nice photo of all the main actors/singer characters from the movie. If I was being critical I would have liked to have seen the lyrics printed as well to allow the listener to sing along but since this movie used the biggest artists from the 80s a lot of fans will own the original Bon Jovi, Guns N Roses, Def Leppard and other artists albums anyway so would have them on those inserts. I'd never heard of the actors Julianne Hough or Diego Boneta, they along with Cruise, Baldwin, Brand and Jones have more than done justice to these iconic rock songs, they've refreshed interest in them for a new generation. I imagine after having seen this movie as well as this soundtrack a lot of younger fans will have gone out and bought (well downloaded maybe) Appetite for Destruction, Slippery When Wet, Hysteria and the other albums anyway, to discover and own those great original artist versions of these songs for themselves.<br /><br />The only average song on here is the one that was intentionally written to be that, Undercover Love sung by Drew when the record industry Vanilla Ice style wanted to dress him and change him into something else and we have a New Kids of the Block style boy band song.  Even though the song obviously isn't good, it's nice it's on here to get the full movie memory as the CD plays. Plus hey maybe some people like it.  You can always memory it out your playlists, or press skip.en though the song obviously isn't good, it's nice it's on here to get the full movie memory as the CD plays.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|I needed an alarm clock app for my Google Nexus tablet and this one has satisfied that need in many ways thus far.
B008BZIUHG|5.0|I totally agree with the other critiques here.....a band to be reckoned with.  I love every minute of every song!  Although everyone in the band is a very strong player, I feel that the singer is the star here....no male rock vocalist with this much versatility, control and quality has come around for many a year....let's hope they get the credit they deserve before they lose their recording contract, like so many other great up & comers have done over the years.  If only their record company would PROMOTE them.  I believe if they only had the exposure, the fans would come out of the woodwork.  I can't wait to see this band in person....hopefully, that chance will come.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This show is by far one of cable TV's better ideas. American Horror Story is a scary, creepy fun ride.
B00917IQFY|4.0|For those who thought the coming together this year of Dexys after 27 years was a fair old passage of time, think again. It appears that the great Graham Parker has trumped this by reuniting his original band the Rumour for their first album \\"Three chords good\\" after 31 years of separation. It is the most welcome of returns for a singer and artist of real stature. He has recorded some stellar solo albums over the years (check out the wonderful \\"Imaginary Television\\") but never quite made the impact that he did when combined with the rock solid backing of the Rumour. Their early albums such as \\"Howlin Wind\\" and the superb \\"Squeezing out sparks\\" are as good as any thing that came from the pen of Elvis Costello or Nick Lowe and as a live outfit Graham Parker and the Rumour needed fire engines at the ready they were that incendiary. This reviewer once lost three pounds in weight at one of their gigs when amazingly he was supported by the Springsteen prot&eacute;g&eacute;es Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes; what a night! This despite the fact that Parker was one of the most unlikely rock stars whose ever present sunglasses always seemed bigger than his head and his diminutive size betraying a man of huge fiery passion.<br /><br />It is pleasing to report that the bringing together of all the original constituent parts of Graham Parker and the Rumour works with ease and aplomb. Granted the cover picture looks like a bunch of middle age blokes standing outside a pub but these same blokes form part of one of the best backing bands this side of the E Street Band. They include the great Martin Belmont and that guitarist at the heart of British music and inventor of pub rock Brinsley Schwarz. As always it is the voice of Graham Parker that is centre stage and what a powerful instrument it is. The opening song \\"Snake oil capital of the world\\" has a nasty reggae beat and a nice lyrical backdrop where Parkers sneer is pitch perfect. Throughout the album is full of cracking songs not least the joyous soul of \\"Long emotional ride\\", the hard rocking \\"A Lie Gets Halfway 'Round the World\\" and the pointed squall of \\"Coathangers\\" which does remind the listener of the label once applied to Parker namely the \\"Bob Dylan of the Home Counties\\". Other highlights here include the gorgeous organ driven ballad \\"Stop cryin about the rain\\" while the anti war \\"Arlington's Busy\\" is an angry standout song set against the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan where Parker takes the indifference to these ongoing conflicts and observes \\"And Arlington's busy and business is brisk, not that you'd notice cuz ignorance is bliss,\\"<br /><br />Some will argue that Parker and Co could do this music in their sleep and that \\"Three chords\\" does perhaps lack the blistering energy of earlier work, but does that matter? Graham Parker and the Rumour came to the forefront at a time in the seventies which witnessed punk move to new wave. Only a few years before rock fans had to endure interminable keyboard solos by Keith Emerson and the high pitched whining of Jon Anderson in Yes singing about whales or imaginary oceans. Graham Parker was a breath of fresh air stripping back music to a level of unadulterated raw power coinciding with the energy of punk but also churning out great lyrical songs. \\"Three Chords Good\\" marks the return of someone who feels like a very dear old friend who has brought his best mates along for the ride. And very welcome they are.st the joyous soul of \\"Long emotional ride\\", the hard rocking \\"A Lie Gets Halfway 'Round the World\\" and the pointed squall of \\"Coathangers\\" which does remind the listener of the label once applied to Parker namely the \\"Bob Dylan of the Home Counties\\".

B008ZD4WN0|5.0|This is a review of the Audio Fidelity Gold version of this cd. The Sound is full, warm and nicely balanced. It sounds so nice that I have listened to it 4 times in a row at good volume with no fatigue to my ears. I think they have done a great job with this one. Please, give us some more that sound like this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the perfect third book of the series! Can't wait to see if there are more to follow - possibly from Christian's  point of view?
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This is an awesome series!!  I've watched the first three seasons non-stop, and am now midway throught he fourth.  The actors are perfectly cast, and the storyline never fails to keep me addicted!!  Five stars really aren't enough to rate Breaking Bad!
141694737X|5.0|The book is super simple but the kids love opening the flaps to see which animal was sent. The younger kid would even say \\"bye bye\\" when we close the flap. The illustrations are simple but cute. It's a great book to read to get the kids excited about going to the zoo. It also teaches them animals. I would read it to them so many times, I have all the animals memorized. It's a perfect collection for children.

B001XCWPAM|5.0|Best price I was able to find. I rebel at the idea of buying digital copy and all the other garbage that I don't need, and these were exactly what I needed. Blu Ray movie only and at an unbeatable price!
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|This is a very easy and good read, relaxing but it engages your attention throughout.  Although it skips around the generations, it is easy to follow and absorbs you in the plot until the end.

B007HACDLK|5.0|In true Mitch Rapp style, Mitch overcomes his own physical issues to &#34;solve the case.&#34;  The simplest detail doesn't get past Rapp's sense for solving problems.  Didn't see the end coming until late in the book.  Worth the read -- and looking forward to seeing how Flynn weaves Irene Kennedy's newest agent into future plots!  As usual I'm glad Mitch Rapp is on our side!
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade's music matches her beauty and her soul. When you hear her sing, it is so profound, timeless, and from her very heart. I doubt very seriously, if there will ever be another female of her caliber, who through her music, you can feel the very essence of the person, who is singing it. I would recommend any of her music, I love the comment, Sade made about making music. She said, \\" she is not in the business of making music to sell music, she makes music, when she feels like, she has something to say.\\" That to me sums it up, her comment says it all.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|Love this album, and the little comments made between her and the engineer.<br />Felt like I was right there with Barbra at the studio.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I shall look forward to reading the next book in this trilogy.  This was wonderful.  I wish I had not read  &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; so long ago but it did not detract from this book at all.

0061474355|5.0|I first read Garth Nix's Sabriel when I was in grade school. Already a big fan of authors such as J.K. Rowling, Phillip Pullman, and Tamora Pierce, all with the most life-like heroines, I was looking for another book full of adventure, magic, and that strong heroine. This book goes beyond all three. I've now read the Abhorsen trilogy multiple times and I must say, Sabriel could take Hermione or Alanna on any day. Thank you Garth Nix, for your ability to bring to life such a talented, brilliant, fun character for girls young and old to look up to.

0618918248|5.0|Having spent my entire education in establishments firstly run by nuns and then by christian brothers and having endured the mental and sometimes physical abuse that they seem to need to use to enforce and implant their ideas I had developed my own thoughts on religion and god many years ago, needless to say how I truly feel about the subject.<br /><br />It makes me extremely happy that Richard Dawkins exists.<br /><br />It's sad there are some people with truly twisted ideas of what is right and wrong, who need to be made accountable for their actions and their views still in places of great influence, in all religions and all societies.<br /><br />The title of this review says it for me, I really enjoyed reading it. It's full of undeniable truth that any sane, logical person should appreciate and maybe enjoy.<br /><br />D
B004HZ14QS|5.0|I have always loved hearing Weather Reports live recordings, and this one didn't fail. With their final line up,they had a rejuvenation of energy,without skipping a beat.I recommend this recording,for the simple reason,that Zawinul,Shorter,combination, along with their new sidemen gave a powerful performance to these new and to the older arrangements.I'm 56, and all of their recordings,might be a little bias. These are legendary musicians,Joe Zawinul 1932-2007,the modern day Mozart',Wayne Shorter,great composer,arranger,musician.This is a must have,for I am told by my musician friends,Weather Report,was the musicians,musicians band.Love this band,Samuel;
B003IWRE3I|5.0|You will hear a great many people tell you that this film is depressing. I thought it was one of the most uplifting films I have ever seen; even the long, long periods of unrelenting bleakness hold their own strange and grey beauty. This is a wonderful movie that illustrates the importance of maintaining hope, however fragile and dangerous that can appear to be.<br /><br />It is a long and at times difficult movie to watch but if you really want a thoughtful and reflective experience, then there is a lot to enjoy within The Road. It is, in many places, a visually stunning film with breathtaking photography and a constant focus on the horror of living day to day with death; a sharp, clear possiblity at any given moment. And yet, somehow, through all of this, we are led to one beautific, 'golden' moment that makes everthing we have seen and endured worthwhile, worthwhile and deserved.<br /><br />I strongly recommend reading the book, it has (possibly) the finest final paragraph I have ever read. It evokes images of woods and water, flights of mystery painted in vivid flashing colour, primal emotions described in words that will take you both in and out of yourself.

Harry is really like a very good wine and is better by getting older! Hope that you would have the chance to read it!

B00ABGEFWC|3.0|This app is fun but there's not much to do.I mean when I install a game I expect it to be entertaining and idicting.<br />This game is kinda boring. I hope they update it and make it better. Here's what this game is like........<br /><br />1.  Good graphics.Cute pets.Good backgrounds.<br /><br />2. Game gets old after an hour or 2. boring quests.<br /><br />3. HAS LOTS OF ANNOYING GITCHES.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I rather enjoyed this app. It was quite short, though, and already finished it within a few hours. If it were a bit longer, I would have given it a full 5. Other than that, very good!
B009OCR1X4|5.0|Cloud Atlas, the movie, was almost 3 hours in length. It featured many famous movie actors and, as I'm sure you've read by now from the movie reviews, took on the ambitious task of telling 6 different stories in 6 different genres, with the actors playing multiple characters. With a movie as complex as Cloud Atlas, I thought music would be the last thing I'd pay attention to. Fortunately, I was wrong.<br /><br />The soundtrack for Cloud Atlas is actually composed by one of the directors of the movie (and two other collaborators)! I was extremely impressed when I found out Tom Tykwer was a director and a composer - talk about talent. I believe his involvement with the direction of the movie made the soundtrack even better, because he knew exactly what emotions he wanted to convey for which scenes.<br /><br />My absolute favourite tracks are actually variations of the same song (\\"All Boundaries Are Conventions\\", \\"Cloud Atlas Finale\\", and \\"Cloud Atlas End Title\\"). The beauty lies in their simplicity - always starting off with a simple piano melody before building up with the full orchestra to a gorgeous and emotional piece. The motif for these tracks played during key moments in the movies, which is another reason why these tracks are my favourite. This song will always be the \\"theme\\" of Cloud Atlas for me. (The piece that Robert Frobisher composes is called the \\"Cloud Atlas Sextet\\" but it is a completely different song from the previous 3 tracks I mentioned.)<br /><br />I think this soundtrack will made a great addition to any soundtrack collection. Make sure you see the movie too! The music fits perfectly.
B009G7ZYPY|2.0|To me Miss Boyle is an enigma. Powered to fame by one appearance on TV and helped by an internet global audience, she has indeed captured hearts worldwide. But not this one. She has the instrument to create the perfect performance. Unfortunately she is being misguided in her vocal capabilities. Strange that she has not got round to giving her UK 'adoring' public what they would want most - a national concert tour singing live. Not hiding behind guest spots on somebody elses show. The reason is obvious. She has no charisma or stage presence. She hasn't had time to hone her craft over years. She sadly has the disadvantage of coming to fame in her middle 40's. Nothing wrong with that. But she needs someone to guide and manage her and train her so that she can project and get behind the song she's performing. I cannot by any stretch of the imagination see that in this CD. There is no depth, no light and shade in what she is singing. She cannot maintain her fame just by producing CD's on an annual basis at Christmas. She needs to start to stretch herself. I was brought up on the greatest singers of the 20th century - Streisand, Garland, Simone, Piaf and Bassey - artists who know how to perform live. Sadly, today's crop of singers are now manufactured and I'm afraid Miss Boyle is in that league.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|When I heard her sing on television I had to buy this album.  Consider, she has had 4 hits off this one album.  Really a super, super, album.  If you haven't heard Rolling in the Deep you have missed a real treat.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Easy read that keeps you interested from beginning to end. Recommended for all ages. It was a great book. May the odds be ever in your favor
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game everypony needs to play!<br />Much like other city building games it's &quot;spend real money or wait to do stuff&quot; but the stuff you can do is wonderfully fun.

B0047IRB08|3.0|(All links in this review are to LPs, not CDs.)<br /><br />Yes it's true that SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND epitomizes the Summer of Love, yet with the hindsight of four-plus decades it's also clear that save for some exceptional cover art this album is too inconsistent for the \\"legendary\\" status that so many accord it.

John's best contribution, the driving \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" was the result of a Kellogg's cereal commercial. His \\"Mr. Kite\\" is mellotronically trivial and \\"A Day in the Life\\" lacks direction: John reads or hears bad news, but wants to give you drugs (or get you aroused, if you'd rather believe that).

B0053TMP24|5.0|This was a great book because you get to see how Percy responds to being in the new Roman camp which we were introduced to in the last book. The action just keeps going, and you will be flipping the pages to find out what happens next. I recommend this book to anyone who read the first Heroes of Olympus ans enjoyed it.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|I honestly enjoyed the book and the mind of Lawrence Krauss.  What a great thinker and we are so lucky to have him.  I just felt that although he did break things down to a semi-common persons perspective there were areas he could have done better.  I have no direct areas to point out right now but that is my feeling about the book.  Very good read and I highly recommend it to anyone searching for a greater understanding of life and the universe we live in.

B005E0CDTC|5.0|MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was a dismal failure as a BBC television special, and justly so. In fact, it was so awful the program was never aired in the United States. Unscriptedly ad-lib and haphazard, the film's occasional musical performance highlights couldn't redeem what was a silly exercise in group personal excess.<br /><br />Conversely, the American record album of MMT (ironically unavailable in Britain) was a wondrous thing indeed. Inside the record's foldout cover are several pages of 12\\" stills taken directly from that strange movie. The LP also contain the complete song lyrics. Best of all, several Top 40 records that weren't a part of that original TV show were used to flesh out this set.<br /><br />The majority of the songs on this Xmas '67 release received a great deal of American AM radio airplay at the time. No other US Beatles album contain as many chart topping hits as MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. Pretty good for what at the time was considered a letdown for all involved and their fans.<br /><br />In many ways, MMT holds up better than SGT. PEPPER'S. Musically, if not cinematically, this was the Beatles at their height as a cohesive group.<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[2:51] Magical Mystery Tour<br />[3:00] The Fool on the Hill<br />[2:16] Flying (Instrumental)<br />[3:56] Blue Jay Way<br />[2:29] Your Mother Should Know<br />[4:36] I Am the Walrus<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[3:30] Hello, Goodbye<br />[4:10] Strawberry Fields Forever<br />[3:03] Penny Lane<br />[3:03] Baby, You're a Rich Man<br />[3:48] All You Need Is Love<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 36:48
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|This movie had the potential for greatness but falls short. Charlize Theron is of course excellent as expected. I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart and here is another reason why. Kristen goes from not being able to hold a knife to leading an army and taking down the queen. Very unbelievable. The world however was very imaginative and beautiful. Battle scenes were almost good but usually bland and hurried. I wanted to like this movie but ultimately its just an average 3 out of 5. Watch it if you want but don't expect a instant classic.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|The writing style is clear and easy to digest. Each page contains at least one thing that educates, entertains, AND illuminates.  The author is refreshing in his direct, no-nonsense, self-deprecating approach to communicating an entire strategy and methodology to making a living in this new world order.  And as I was gliding along, enjoying this read, I got to Chapter 9 entitled \\"Hustling:  The Gentle Art of Self-Promotion\\".  It is the ONLY chapter that pictures an image of a black man.  I reviewed all 14 chapters and noticed that there was not one image of a person of color throughout the entire book -- which was fine -- except at this chapter.  While this did not take away from my appreciation of the book, it did change my opinion of the author.  I didn't find associating an image of a black man with the word \\"hustling\\" clever, cute, or amusing; but I did find it offensive, insensitive, and confusing.  A picture speaks a thousand words and this one prompted me to out of Chris' mailing list.  The book is well worth the read and the price, but it will be the last money the author ever sees from me.

B009ERK1T0|5.0|I've been a Deftones fan since their first album. This is by far their best overall work to date. As another reviewer said, \\"they just keep getting better with age\\".
B005HSL626|3.0|It is ok but I like angry birds better  The bood Turtle boy is very good.  I do care for bubble pop.Every word is ok.  I have not played Scrabble yet as my first Kindle is defective  and I turned it in for a Kindle Fire.  Was everything transfered from the first kindle to this Kindle fire?  I only just registered it a day or two ago. Please make sure my first Kindle is deleted as I only have the new one  Kindle Fire.  Thank you
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, its a little quirky, but a nice story. Good acting and makes you think about your future and appreciate what you have.
0307383415|5.0|I like this book so much better than The Audacity of Hope.  It really gave me a new perspective and appreciation for the man that became our POTUS.
0451232852|5.0|About a year I ago I was all set to buy this book and foolishly scrolled down to the reviews. I read enough negative reviews to deter me from buying this book. Luckily, someone got me this book for a gift and I did end up reading it.<br /><br />I cannot write as nearly an eloquent review as most of these other ones here. Here goes: This book is amazing. It intertwines several characters' stories with actual historical events and people. The characters run the gambit from honest and virtuous to selfish and downright evil. Plus, it is Ken Follett so throw in violence, sex, and revenge.<br /><br />I read ALL his other books and love them like most everybody does. Why did I listen to the reviews?! This one is no exception. Follett cannot write a bad book. READ IT.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i am addicted to this game! i play it everyday! and i would definately recommend this game. if you can get this game!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Entertaining and Interesting.  Mixing jewel match and observation.<br /><br />Not easy, but not all that hard either.  It will take some time, but it's nice to have something to do that just takes your mind off everyday things.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've had this case for over 10 months now and have been super-impressed with it's durability and effectiveness at protecting my phone. (I've dropped it on the pavement on several occasions.) It adds the least bulk of any other case I've tried. My case has not yellowed at all, as one other reviewer stated. Love it!
B0073LWEXK|3.0|This game does make you want to keep playing and playing. It is a game which you have to tap areas to perhaps find items and then figure out how to use them. I would have never figured it out without the help of the hint book that is included in the game. Be prepared to use the map nonstop. Interesting game but a boring story line.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was amazing! It was fun and creative. Beautifully written! A must read! You love the characters and begin to try and figure out the puzzle pieces as you read.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|What is there to say.  This is Kindle, one of the top e-reading devices on the planet.  I got one on my first computer and I've never looked back.<br /><br />If you like to read you need this.  Computer, tablet or any device it is available for!
B007HACDLK|4.0|The Last Man is well done, as are just about all Vince Flynn books.  Nice to read action books written from an America first point of view.
B007OV9EYG|3.0|The Lorax is a great movie with many funny events. I was excited to receive the dvd combo package only to realize that instead I received a single dvd.<br /><br />There's only 1 disc in the case instead of 3 as stated. Very disappointed and hope something can be sorted out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this Solitaire version the best.  It has the best layout and functions to customize the game. This looks the same for all my devices like iphone and Kindle Fire HD.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I got this as the free app of tthe day and it was very fun! Very short though. 8 &quot;chapters&quot; long and very short they are. There's a hint guide you can look at in your journal for free hints you can use as a walkthrough. I beat it the same day I got it hints came in handy. I recommend this to any fans of puzzle games. And as others have said it is ALOT like Mist.

1594484805|2.0|The author argues that intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic motivation.  Except for simple, algorthmic tasks, when the manager should apologize for the situation and provide a random award!<br /><br />This book doesn't adequately summarize the professional works of groups highly interested in motivation: psychologists, organizational developers, HR practitioners, industrial engineers, process engineers, managers or managerial accountants.  The author clearly prefers theory Y to theory X and the appendix of recomended books reinforces this worldview.<br /><br />Honestly, there's not much new or well-supported content here.  Economists have discovered behavioral economics!  Crowd-sourcing ala wikipoedia, Linux and Foxfire is real!. Academic studies reveal that monkeys and humans like to solve puzzles and dislike being controlled!  Skinnerian behavioral psychology is too simple for use in educating, managing or leading!  Companies have discovered that engagement matters, free time generates results, micromanaging demotivates, time flexibility is valued and that a purpose beyond profit maximization is appreciated!<br /><br />The author, Daniel Pink, promotes self-determination theory (SDT), focusing on the importance of autonomy, with little time devoted to competence or relatedness.  He devotes 2 chapters to the importance of mastery and purpose.<br /><br />The book is not highly convincing.  Intrinsic motivation matters.  Autonomy, mastery and purpose motivate.  Extrinsic motivation schemes, poorly applied, can backfire.<br /><br />Real-world managers know all of this.  However, external motivation schemes appear to be effective with most professional staff in most functions.  There is a need to control and coordinate activities.  External rewards and punishments play a role in motivating and aligning.  Effective managers delegate required results, specify limits and encourage staff to find creative solutions.  Some staff embrace opportunity and accountability, while others are scared to death.  Treating staff like cogs in the machine is wrong and ineffective.  Simplistic or highly stretched motivational schemes promote cheating.  Engagement and purpose matter.  Staff flee from really bad managers.<br /><br />No serious management thinker ever bought into the extreme Frederick Taylor or B.F. Skinner views of human behavior and work design.  Smart managers should look for opportunities to complement necessary/effective/humane external measures/incentives with intrinsic motivators such as problem solving, autonomy, mastery, purpose, competence and relatedness.<br /><br />This book raises the issue, but provides little practical guidance.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|A father needs to know his responsibility.<br /><br />This is a great movie made by a group that promotes family, the Christian philosophy, and the belief in God that is very helpful for us Christians to promote our beliefs and integrity. Especially now, this time of the year, when everybody (including 90% of the media) is fighting Christmas. Fortunately for the integrity of this country, people who came from Europe, don't want this country to become Europe. And they are fighting back! However, unfortunately, the silent Christian majority in this country does not vote (for a reason that I don't understand yet) but they are not going to let the secular progressives take over this great country.<br /><br />The movie is about a cop father that understands his responsibilities only after a huge personal tragedy. The contrast is made throughout the movie between the cop kids and the fatherless thugs. It is true that the father person is missing among most of the thugs, but that is not an excuse. It is not an excuse for people to beat up on a young seventeen high school kid as a hazing in order to be admitted in the gang. Anybody who accepts this kind of beating has no self respect and this has nothing to do with the fact that he grew up without a father.<br /><br />Very good movie to watch with your family. Five stars all the way.
0345803485|3.0|I decided to get all three books since I heard such great things about them and I got about a quarter into the first one and had already grown tired of it.<br /><br />It's VERY, PAINFULLY repetitive. Ana is constantly biting her lip or rolling her eyes and Christian comments on it every. Single. Time. Nobody simply talks they always \\"whisper\\" or \\"gasp\\", and the sex scenes, while amusing, are all the same and seem to pop up on every other page and each time is the best. Who really has that much sex anyways?!? Overall, it seems like a teenage girl wrote this in her room after school one day about her crush in her geometry class. He's an extremely attractive, extremely young billionaire who has a very large penis.<br /><br />I can't lie, pushing the annoyances to the side the story isn't that bad (which is why I gave it two stars). I made it to the end and now I'm curious to how the series ends. I'm partially into the second installation but I imagine that Christian and Ana get married and give each other \\"soul shattering\\" orgasms till death do them part.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book does NOT disappoint and the writing style is succinct and each chapter propels the reader to the next chapter seamlessly and leaves you wanting to know more as details surrounding the murder of a judge and what a jailed lawyer knows about it.<br />Malcolm Bannister is in jail for fraud and somehow knows details no one else does about the person(s) who killed a federal judge and since frustrated FBI agents have no leads, they release him from jail and give him immunity and a whole new identity if they will tell him the judge's killer.<br />In true Grisham fashion, he leads the reader through the twists and turns of this whodunit and without giving away any details, the reader sees the pieces fall together and how the plot was hatched and revenge is a dish best served cold. Grisham obviously had fun writing this book as it has wit and humor and details are thoughtfully used to show Malcolm's humanity and how he methodically used his jailhouse lawyer status to get revenge against the legal system and plan his freedom beyond prison bars.

B005LAIHY0|1.0|This movie is analogous to a fanciful store that's on Rodeo Drive but when you go inside they actually sell horse manure! Or this is the latest Alien in the fashion of the last Indy Jones movie, it's that garish! Or a pretentious bookstore that only sells porno mags. The mystery of the film is a real presence but once you get to the actual details it just falls apart. I'd like to say this is NOT a Hollywood movie, this is a British cast and production shot on location nowhere near America. Hollywood at least doesn't put on the airs that these jokers to do being sophisticated. The secret of our makers is that they will rip our heads off? Come on!<br /><br />The thing that even made me watch this was Scotts reputation(even though I hate his clearly British/Scottish discriminatory hiring/casting practices). This movie will dissuade me from taking Scott seriously ever again. I guess I could partially blame it on that awful LOST writer who worked on this but still it's a Scott film. Ugly British actors don't help either. The Brits would be the last ones to get so far in space, the modern ones mind you not the empire ones.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into all the details but suffice it to say one major example is the UGLY main female actress directs her own c-section by a robotic surgery machine, which patches her up with metal staples (like out of an actual stapler) then gets up immediately afterwards and runs away. Come on, really?  Also they have the obligatory android with his head ripped off, again really? Recycling is great, just not in a movie. And these \\"scientists\\" are about as competent as teenage girls at the prom. I mean come on, didn't the genius writers and director even think about consulting with an actual scientist or engineer or even oh say anyone on the street when it comes to basic survival and logic skills? If you want an extreme aged old man CAST ONE, don't waste a huge amount of money and time to do a thoroughly unconvincing makeup job on some out of work Brit you want to give a job to.  This tripe is decent for about 40 minutes, after that it's just garbage.<br /><br />Wooden acting, ridiculous plot holes and embarrassingly out of touch with reality characters make this one great big crapola of a movie courtesy of Scott, Lindelof and half of Scotland/Britains finest wanker actors and actresses. Thanks for your time.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This is a book that you will either love or not. I am in the latter category.  I found its plot slow and thin and considered abandoning it several times. I did finish it, and found the last third of the story pick up significantly.<br /><br />There has been a lot of praise for this book and I can understand why, its  a bit \\"arty\\" and presents  the reader with a mood and style that is unique. Ms. Morgenstern is clearly a talented writer. However, like I said - its either your cup of tea or not.
B0001I562I|5.0|For the longest time I've been looking for &#34;flight of the navigator&#34; on DVD and could never find it. One of my friends said to look on Amazon.com and see if they have it, well they did! I love this movie as it was one of my favorite childhood movies. The movie was priced really good in my opinion and shipping was fast. If you love this movie as I do and have little children then buy this movie for them. You will love it and so won't the kids. Worth every single penny!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really love minecraft. I have the Pc version and was one of the 1st people to get the kindle version. I do have one thing I really hate though. the creative mode. it has no animals and has a limited amount of blocks. I really would like if this minecraft edition got all the blocks, and things like the spawning stuff. I love those :)
B006H5120E|5.0|The 3D Blu-Ray video transfer is just awesome. The James Cameron team did a great job on this version of an already great movie. It is far better than the regular Blu-Ray or the DVD.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Zoom for Kinect<br /><br />The idea of the Zoom is to cover the Kinect optics with sort of a fisheye lens that allows a wider peripheral view of the scene, which in essence makes your smaller room seem bigger to the Kinect. The theory is sound and would be flawlessly executed with the right optical quality. The Zoom has inconsistent quality because of its cheap optics.<br /><br />I can see spots on the anti-reflective coatings that causes the IR illuminator/receptor to become distorted. It would go berserk when trying to read my limb movements, or not register them at all. A large portion of the image wouldn't be seen by the Kinect due to the cheap optics.<br /><br />Overall: 1/5 stars. Great in theory, but the lenses are just too cheaply made and expected at this price level.

B003JTHXOK|2.0|I debated between 2 and 3 stars, but ended up with a 2 because Sparks seemed to be just going through the motions with this story.  The passion that used to exist in some of his other books was lacking here.  The biggest disappointment was the ending!  Besides being bizarre, it seemed Sparks lacked the energy to complete the story.  There was not even an epilogue.

B005IUYE1S|5.0|This was a great read! I am hoping that the book on CD is just as good, but I haven't actually even unwrapped it yet, because it is unabridged, so I need to go on a fairly long car trip to enjoy all of it. That might not happen for a while.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|I love the message that the author is trying to get across but I don't believe his talent is in writing. The constant mention that's it is difficult to describe what he actually saw, felt and experienced was apparent in his inability to really draw me in. He speaks of so many lessons he learned but really doesn't try much to explain some of the answers he received to his questions which is something I found myself longing for the entire time through this book. I think we all read about NDEs in search of some answers but this book didn't provide them, just a very vague picture of what he experienced. I also wanted to hear more about what efforts were made to find out how he spontaneously was diagnosed with meningitis. In conclusion this book left me feeling unsatisfied but it was an interesting course of events and the message that is trying to be sent out to the readers deserves real attention which the author could have elaborated on. How have you lived your life differently after this experience? Have you treated people differently? Do things taste different? Smell different? Etc, etc.

B0052RDHTM|3.0|I stayed away from this book originally because of the controversy surrounding the higher price for the Kindle version.  I finally broke down and while I am not sorry that I read it because I like historical fiction and well researched histories.  I liked the characters here and their larger than life rolls leading up to, during, and after World War I.  It just seemed like their sexual intimacy was a little contrived, a little too much, and at times distracting.  I will probable read the next one because Mr. Follett knows his history and makes it compelling.

B0097BY3K6|5.0|The more I listen to David Garrett's albums the more I \\"get\\" his artistry.  There is a surprise to capture my attention in every song and MUSIC is no exception.  With Viva La Vida, he recorded a measure (or a couple) making it sound like a \\"round\\" like we used to sing as kids -- a very sophisticated round.  I've heard this Bond song many times but never with this much energy and passion.  Love it.  When you listen to We Will Rock You, you won't be able to sit still.  And, I can't get enough of Sandstorm and Music.  Great album.
0525952926|5.0|Worth the wait for this second book. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next one. Arrived quickly and in good condition.
0061474355|5.0|First of all, I read this book nearly sixteen years ago, when I was really young, and declared it my favorite book of all time.<br /><br />And it's stayed that way.<br /><br />The themes are weighty--death, dangerous power, personal failure--and the whole feel of the book is dark. But intertwined are aspects of love, youth, friendship, and family. This book has a roundness of thought that allows it to resonate, both to a nine-year-old and a twenty-four-year-old (and older, of course).<br /><br />And aside from all that, there are no elves, no orcs, and no magic wands. Don't get me wrong; I'm a supporter of all of those things, as long as they're incorporated into a novel well, but SABRIEL is refreshing in that the magic and the adversaries are completely different from fantasy convention (ZOMBIES!). Deliciously macabre, with an awesome twist on necromancy, this is flat-out one of the greatest fantasy novels--and the beginning to one of the greatest fantasy series--out there. And Garth Nix has the wonderful ability to always hint at more beneath the surface; when you read this book, you find that richness--that \\"iceberg\\"--woven in. He only shows you the tip of the iceberg when he writes, but you know that below the surface is a huge and murky bulk of knowledge backing the fabric of the story.<br /><br />Another thing I love about Garth Nix's narrative style is that he just drops you into the story. No apologies, no explanations. Just BAM! story. He's a generous writer--he allows the reader to enter this world he's created with relative ease, but without dreaded info-dumpy exposition about what these different elements are and how they're used/what purpose they serve.<br /><br />And finally, Sabriel herself is awesome. Like, zombie-slaying, magic-wielding, mess-with-her-you're-dead awesome. I think the biggest criticism I've seen of the book has been directed at Sabriel's character (which is ridiculous), but I think the reason why is this:<br /><br />Sabriel is already confident. She still does a lot of growing up in the book, and coming to terms with her situation and the responsibilities that have suddenly been thrust at her, but she manages to [mostly:] keep a cool head and push through all the danger and tribulation that she faces.<br /><br />And I think a lot of people mistake this innate confidence with stale characterization. Most coming-of-age novels take a bumbling and/or painfully shy character and then morph them into a competent go-getter at the end. There's nothing wrong with this, but Sabriel's growth as a character is already well on its way to super-awesome-badass-girlpower-heroine status, and people seemed to have wanted her to have started off as a jellyfish. I commend Nix for giving us a girl who doesn't need a confidence boost to begin with.y confident.

0061474355|5.0|I first read Sabriel when I was a preteen, after I pulled it off the shelf of the public library because the spine caught my eye. I was getting into fantasy lit at the time and the little metal face peeking out, along with the distinctive title, grabbed my attention; I looked it over, decided I like the looks of character on the front (thank you, The Dillons), and checked it out. I don't think I've never been more fortunate to have judged a book by its cover!<br />Sabriel is a beautifully imagined high fantasy adventure about a young woman with the unique ability to send dead beings who have been reanimated back into death (zombie fans take note -- this is a book for you!). The characters inhabit a fantasy continent divided in two by a magical wall; south of the wall everything's more or less as it is here, but north of the wall, where much of the action of the book takes place, there is magic. There are burning demons, a sarcastic cat, magic bells, epic battles, beautiful prophetesses, kings and queens--it's got everything! I love these books!! Sabriel is one of the strongest female protagonists you'll find in or out of fantasy books -- she's whip smart, strong and capable, but reassuringly human at the same time. I (a children's librarian, I should mention) love recommending this book to young girls, in no small part because Sabriel (and later the sequels) had a profound influence on me as a girl. I wanted to be just like her (not to mention Lirael, who may be a large part of why I became a librarian, though I haven't met a stilken in the stacks yet).<br />This book is perfect for a 6th grade reader or older who enjoys high fantasy. I still read it every year or so, so adults shouldn't shy away either!<br /><br />Read-alikes include: The Hobbit/LotR, The Hunger Games, Graceling, The Golden Compass/His Dark Materials, The Lightning Thief
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|Yeah the songs aren't that different from what he has already put out there. But when I need some Joe I add this to his other stuff and put on random play and the catchy tunes fit right in.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I use headphones in my work as a transcriptionist and this is my second pair of Sony.  They are wonderful, drown out outside noise and give me the ability to pick up dialog I wouldn't be able to hear with conventional headphones.  They are comfortable after hours of wearing them.  My last pair lasted over five years, finally the leather started flaking off the ear pieces and the coil was tangled up so badly that it started wearing through and wires were exposed.  My husband use electric tape and still uses them for his Ipod.  This new pair seems (so far) to have that tangled cord problem fixed, which is so annoying.  The cord seems heavier and doesn't twist up.  I've been using it for several months with no cord problems, but we'll see how that lasts in the long run.  Comes with a nice leather bag for storage.  I would recommend.

B001QOGYBI|4.0|This was a not so clever but funny movie. A fox that gives up stealing for the family life that he eventually goes back on his animal instincts to steal. Large cast of actors. I thought the addition of saying cuss instead of any cuss word was really funny. I would show this movie to kids. It wasnt offensive or obscene or very crude. Still had many crude moments as does many movies now adays but it was great to watch nonetheless.

B00008L3U1|4.0|This is a very good movie. For writing purposes I understand why they over-exaggerated the disease and it fit the morel of the movie. This morel is to live your life like it's your last. Robin Williams...No the entire cast did a great job on this one. Maybe not Bill Cosby but he did what he could. This movie has many elements to it in regards to the importance of life, friendship, and family. Alot of little boy humor sure but it really isnt a kids movie either. Great movie I recommend for anyone.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|I love to smile, smiling's my favorite!<br />I didn't really intend to purchase this - I clicked the 1-click shopping button for more details and I purchased the download. I can't complain though because now I can watch Elf on my iPad to pass time while commuting! I am certainly smiling.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun times but this time I understand strategy better. fun game.<br />Makes you nostalgic from the days when this game was at the carnivals.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|new to this game and love it!!  took awhile for me to figure out how to play.  i like that it continues on and doesn't end after a certain amount of time.
B005LAII12|4.0|If you arent a fan of Family Guy, American Dad, or the Cleveland show then this really isnt the movie for you. The humor is extremely crude and like Seth Mcfarlenes comedy always has something or someone from his past he enjoyed watching that he brings in. But I like that. I think that his style of comedy is funny but hey. Different strokes for different folks. I felt this movie was a winner. I picture Stewie Griffin growing up into Mark Wahlbergs character and Rupert like Ted. That's basically how I think it was really. But anywho I digress. This movie isnt for those who are done with crude humor. If they know they dont llike Family Guy, American Dad, or the Cleveland show then that is a flag to not watch this movie. Maybe even throw in Drawn Together. If you watch those shows and like them then this movie is for you.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|i am a big fan of these movies and when i saw that it was all on one package and to top it off in BLU RAY i knew i had to have it, what made it even great was the price, i love these movies and i enjoy watching them in crystal clear BLU RAY.
B005ZKYXZI|3.0|It is really just that simple.  An entertaining enough movie.  No surprises, good action, same basic story line of an absentee father.  It is Rocky with robots and a back story of how a kid grows on his own father.  It's worth a watch, but rent it, don't own it.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I honestly don't know who the game is for.<br /><br />It's a massive time-sink that begs for real-world money and has insultingly simple gameplay, even for little kids. Gameloft & Hasbro seem to be counting on people's love of the license and OCD tendencies to be interested in this game to the point of spending money. There are a TON of chances to spend real money, even on accident, and sometimes it's a very large amount of money so be sure you don't allow in-app purchases.<br /><br />The basic break-down is this:<br /><br />Buy pony with in-game, real, or social money, buy a building or decoration the same way, use the building and pony to make an item to get more in-game currency, and repeat ad nauseum. Meanwhile you play a mini-game with a pony to let them make better items. A mini-game you need to spend some form of currency on.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />It's a cute, fairly interesting story. Sloppily handled.  There's little cut-scenes (fully voiced with original cast! Granted some clips are sound bites) at the start of the game and sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />It's an alternative universe, kind of, which takes place at the first episode of Friendship is Magic. Nightmare Moon breaks free and takes over Equestria to put it in darkness. Twilight Sparkle manages to escape to PonyVille and keep Nightmare Moon's darkness at bay. You need to find and activate all the Elements of Harmony, which take the form of shrines spread across the map.<br /><br />I say it's handled sloppily because despite that premise, they still act like the events of the show happened, occasionally referring back to them. I was interested in this version of events where Twilight Sparkle has to draw the Ponyville back after everyone ran away, find the Elements and make friends, but after the opening all that only matters in terms of gameplay mechanics. \\"Push back the darkness\\" by buying a new sector of land. \\"Draw ponies back to Ponyville\\" by spending currency. \\"Find the elements\\" by eventually unlocking that sector which has once (you always know where they are) and spending a resource to activate it. \\"Make friends\\" by having that pony and playing their mini-game.<br /><br />Very disappointing the developers didn't commit to the story.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />It has (very basic) city building & resource management, and really simple mini-games consisting of playing catch, catching apples and flying to collect clouds / money. There's really nothing to the city building so it won't interest most adults and I doubt it will engage any kids.<br /><br />Once you buy a building you place it and assign a pony to work there and start making something to get bits (in-game currency). You can assign a total of three ponies to a building. If you buy a farm, a pony can start making carrots and later carrot cake for instance. Once an item starts being made you have to wait for it to finish. This can range from a 30 second wait to half a day depending on the building and item.<br /><br />In the meantime your ponies also have a counter that's going down, and once it's over you can play one of two mini-games with them. After which you have to wait again. These mini-games are used to get experience to level-up your ponies so they can make better items (that's over-stating it really). The last mini-game you can only place when a pony levels-up, which they can only do 5 times and then you can't play with them anymore.<br /><br />For the catch mini-game there's a ring that closes around the ball as it flies away from the pony; it seems if you hit the ball as the ring is about to close you get the maximum amount of points, meaning you are swiping at the same spot, at the same time, every time. Speed doesn't really change and the arc barely changes. It would be hard to make it simpler. I don't think most kids will play it for more than a few minutes, and this game has you doing it a LOT.<br /><br />The catching apples mini-game isn't bad, you run back and forthcatching apples as they fall while avoid bad apples. Aside from being repetitive, the only real downside is that the bad apples spawn randomly in place of the good apples, and I've had a few times where nearly all the apples that fell were bad. You get 20 points per apple and I generally get around 300-400 in the time they give you, but on those instances I'll get 60-140. Since you potentially have real money on the line, this is very bad.<br /><br />The last mini-game has you flying and collecting money and white clouds (to go faster) while avoiding storm clouds and Shadowbolts (bad flying ponies). It's reminiscent of Jetpack Joyride, just much simpler. It's the most interesting out of the mini-games easily but there's just a few set \\"scenes\\" that are used to randomly make the level and sometimes you'll get very few white clouds and / or money to pick up.<br /><br />There's little quests you can do which involve buying buildings or ponies, or unlocking sectors of land or playing a game X many times. You can use real money gems to skip these and act like you completed them, even getting the quest rewards. Not much thought was put into these, made obvious by a few of them. \\"Spike is hungry for gems! Give him 10 Gems to complete the quest (Or 4 Gems to skip).\\"  Some of the dialogue is cute but the main point of these quests is just to keep you interested and working toward some goal.<br /><br />Social / Currency:<br /><br />There's 3 forms of currency. In-game Bits, social Hearts, and real money Gems. Some items take a crazy amount of Bits, Hearts or Gems, but if you're patient you can always build up to that amount for the former two. Hearts are gotten through free gift-giving with friends, and you can give two hearts a day. If you have at least one friend willing to send you a Heart, you can slowly build up to the amount needed.<br /><br />The extent of the social aspect is seeing their layout and the gift-giving.  The game can connect with other people via the Gameloft Live service or facebook. Once connected you can see your friends and invite them to play. If they play you can look at their version of PonyVille to see how they laid things out.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />It has a very nice presentation but the simple extremely repetitive mechanics, combined with the long wait times, lackluster effort behind the games, and the overwhelming greediness of the atmosphere makes it un-recommendable.<br /><br />Since it's free initially you may want to check out the opening cut-scene and look at the fan favorite ponies that made it into the game, along with some surprising choices. If you want The Dude pony, he's in there. Along with the Jesus Quintana pony, which I always thought was weird to have in a series for kids...
B009AMALLM|2.0|Alrighty. I am a fan of the paranormal movies. I am. I like the idea they had and they tried to run with it. Can't do that anymore. I will go in order of the time line of them. So starting with number 3. I liked it. Really liked it. I liked the dust falling on Tobi and the crazy girl cult and how they made it a prequel. Same formula they had in here they had in all of them though.<br /><br />Number 1. I will say I loved number 1. It reintroduced what a horror movie actually is. The horror movies today are more gore factor thus I have dubbed them Gorror movies. Dont care for those anymore. Why grosse me out when I want a thrill from a good scare. But thats just me. Anywho, this movie pretty much has the same formula that halloween had. Nothing happens for a long time until the end. Tid bits happen here and there but pretty much nothing happens until the end. Just like in Halloween. However in todays movies we dont often like that formula as much. But for the start of a film series, this was a delight. Original in it's own way with the cool parlor tricks and 15,000 dollar budget and I have no choice but to give the original Director props but it still has the exact same formula as halloween.<br /><br />Number 2 was a prequel with like 2 scenes of a sequal to number 1. This had the same formula as well but with Katie's Sister and her family. Didnt matter who it was but it was the same formula that started to bore me. Oh, but get this. The entire family dies and Katie takes hunter. I get it. The demon has come back because of the grandma who made a deal with it for the first male in the family. Okay. Cool. So Katie-Tobi demon has Hunter the first born male in a generation or whatever....Now for the twist.<br /><br />Number 4. Before I get to the twist, again it was the same formula but a different family. Yawn. Lets throw in alittle confusion now. Hunter was put up for adoption to get kidnapped by katie again who had another demon child try  and succeed in getting him possessed or join the Girly cult demon worshippers. I get that number 3 was good by adding the cult. That was kinda creepy and a good addition. But now it was blown up into a whole army of demon possessed girl cult people...Sorry. I was still trying to figure out why Katie or tobi or whatever would still put up Hunter for adoption just to kidnap them again later. It doesnt make sense.<br /><br />So in conclusion these movies for me are 2/4 for the 4 movies. I liked 2 of them. But didnt like the other 2. I still think it would have been better if they had Hunter possessed by Tobi recruit from another family to satisfy its hunger for the babies or girls or whatever crazy demon pimp it is. Not going to buy this one sadly. Even if katie went beast mode on me. Not worth it in my opinion.ossessed or join the Girly cult demon worshippers. I get that number 3 was good by adding the cult.

0740748475|5.0|I got this as a gift (it was on my wish-list)<br /><br />Pro: I love this comic strip. It is one of the greatest strips of all time-following the adventures of Calvin and his stuffed tiger<br />Hobbes it is as good today as it was years ago while it was running. One thing I love, that as a father now I see much of my children in Calvin and Susie--I think it is one of the best things about this book. What great stories, and collected so well together in nice binding.<br /><br />Con: there were very minor printing errors on a few pages with alignment, etc. It didn't take away from the story.<br /><br />Buy this. Don't think to hard about it... just buy this amazing set of books.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Would be a great photo editor, but the edited pictures are not getting saved. Also needs a way to turn off the pop up.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I honestly could not put this down until I  finished. I chose the hardest option &amp; I luv adventure type games you have to think &amp; it takes time to play but this was well done. Highly recommend to everyone. Pinch &amp; zoom worked no glitches, no force closes, no tech problems whatsoever. I'm still on HTC Thunderbolt, Samsung Galaxy SIII in the mail as my upgrade I hope performance is just as flawless. Again, great game.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|it is adicting and every puzzle loving adventure follower needs it it is amazing I love it get it you will love it too
159420411X|4.0|Readable and informative, if not transcendent.  It was a little repetitive towards the end. but I think that was just Nate being thorough.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Loved the other John Corey books, but this was awful, just churned out, no wit, just hated it. don't waste your time
B005LAIH3G|5.0|An adventure tail the whole family can enjoy together.  John Carter finds himself traveling between two worlds both of which need his skills as civil war veteran. The story line coupled with excellent graphics and plenty of action will keep the whole family glued to their seats.
B007SGM084|5.0|better than I expected. gave an insight to and alternate style of intimacy.  Not for the tame of heart or for the timid.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is an excellent hidden object/puzzle game for the kindle fire.  Gripping storyline, clear hider graphics and just the right level of difficulty makes for many hours of fun. Can't wait tip #2!
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|I didn't give this film 1 star because visually, it was beautiful. The scenery, the colors, the details were excellent. The story was terrible, and like many reviewers, I felt that the commercial was misleading or at least was not at all like the movie.<br /><br />At no point in the commercial, the title, the cover, or anywhere else, did I realize that the main theme of this movie was BEARS. The beginning of the movie, where they were telling the story about the father fighting the bear, was okay... and I figured that later on the princess would fight the bear herself. But I wasn't expecting the mother to turn into a bear... or several other things that happened.<br /><br />I don't see this as a \\"Disney Princess\\" movie, if that's what it was supposed to be. Too many characters, too much going on, very little focus on the princess.<br /><br />And my main purpose for watching this was to preview for my children, and I feel that the scenes with the crazed bear and the bears fighting was too intense for young children. I also do not see why they needed to include several adult men's naked rears being shown as a cheap joke after they used their pants to climb down from a tower.<br /><br />I'm glad I watched it before I showed it to them - they will NOT be watching it. I would not recommend this to anyone... I love Pixar films but the themes are getting more \\"intense\\" and dramatic to me. Very disappointed.
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|this game is very easy to play. it's good for children. this game was out last Christmas and there have been no changes to spif it up for this year's release
B009RX7IX8|5.0|All of the series have been great, but this one is the best as they are now partners in crime and lovers in life! The relationship has grown so we now see the crime mystery and the problems and pleasures of their personal development as lovers!
B0053FANT0|5.0|I love the whole series of these movies--this one is good tho it would have been better with Vin in it
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Not an extensive game, I finished it in an afternoon. However, it is well done with nice graphics. The puzzles are complex enough, especially for someone who is not familiar with these mystery games. I liked the more complicated elements<br /><br />Spoilers<br /><br />Not all items or actions are single use.<br />That is a wonderful element, and makes the game that much more involved.<br />Well done!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|I looooved this movie! so good and I laughed out loud by myself in my room... I loved it. haha
B0053O89KG|5.0|Excellent! - Growing together, yet still not able to be honest with each other. From a rebirth beginning to a wonderful conclusion<br />This series is so different [no new confusing partners] just them and the team growing. Castle is the BEST!
1451683405|2.0|Interesting theory but the logic defies me. Just because science can't decide or understand where our thoughts come from doesn't mean we can't control ourselves which is what this author seems to say...
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Why not 5 stars? Well, while I really, really liked this game and still play from time to time I have solved every puzzle, collected every available bonus piece plus 12 or more of each prize and have over 12,000 coins (which are impossible to lose). There is nothing more to accomplish. I frequently hope and check for updates to no avail BUT... it is a fun game.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|This movie was not worth even the rental price. I knew that the subject matter was a bit far out to begin with but I expected more from a Tim Burton film.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Enjoyed the continued character developement.  Story line got a bit busy so keeping up with all the characters started to be difficult towards the end.
B003IEJZUG|3.0|The Illustrated edition was a good deal; the illustrations were quite good impressions of the content. The narrative itself in the early part had too much religious philosophy -- although the basic idea of mixing Hinduism, Judaism, and Christianity was worthwhile. After pressing on, several sections were needlessly gross. In the final part with the island, I was just not able to suspend disbelief (even taking it as allegory or hallucination). Maybe the movie will be better.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|This is a decent app, HOWEVER... it doesn't allow a onetime checkout for multiple items. Not even for multiple items from the same seller. Thus you pay for each item separately &amp; have to pay full price for shipping. Not a great app by any stretch
B007HO392S|5.0|I bought this for a friend and we BOTH agree! It is totally fantastic and neither of us tire of it. Her vocal ability is top-notch, her songs creative and fresh!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Just as the title says, definitely an app worth downloading. All of your battery care needs are taken care of!
B007L6VR6M|5.0|The bizarre humor was worth seeing,  however, i wouldn't recommend it be aloud fir any kid under 16. There is no language problem or nudity, but the sexual intrigue might be tempting in a more sane way
B00A2DOKLU|5.0|i love this because its different from anything out right now.  its fits any setting to listen to music in.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|The best album I've heard this year. I think this may be Fiona's best album. I definitely recommend getting it.
B009S8PEHY|3.0|I was pretty excited about listening to this; and must admit that I am underwhelmed.  I am glad that I only spend $1.99 to download this one.  Rod's voice, the arrangements, the over the top instrumentation ... it doesn't work for me.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Read all Bosch novels.  Michael, you need to publish more but give Harry a female companion that he can relate to.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Amazon had it on preorder and I was sold. Love the series and happy to add it to my collection
B004RC8NXI|3.0|Just a normal movey with a funny history, the dvd disk lable is more beautiful than blue ray disk &ntilde;ab&ntilde;e
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Have a hard time to understand the folks voting so low for this movie, the plot is good, some acting scenes are really well done, landscape footing is simply one of the best I've seen, so thumbs up for Prometheus and I really hope to see a sequel of it. My only complaint is that the deleted scenes had to be included in the movie version, it explains a lot more on the plot. Go for it.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|This is one of their best games they made. I have played several of them and truly liked this one. You do have to buy the second chapter but it gives you the rest and an extra chapter. Worth the money. I only had it freeze once but after I forced it to stop, I didnt have any other problems.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great movie based on a true story. A different look at this time period. Actors were well chosen and there was never a dull moment. Loved it!
B002WY65VU|4.0|not the best movey but is so entertaining, need spanish subtitles.<br />Otherwise everything is fine . . . . .
B002GJT4YQ|5.0|I liked the content of the discs<br />What I like about the product is its presentation<br />highly recommend is satisfied
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I thought this story was sad, funny and inspiering. I'm not sure I want to see the movie.. Because I always expect the movie to be the same as the book. The ending of the book had me laughing.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|What you see is what you get ......and its good  exactly what i was looking for a no frills full screen clock
B0055IU4GM|5.0|John tells a story musically better than almost anyone else! And he does it with such ease!-I wish I could do what he does.
B007HGPBRC|2.0|Dying from cancer is god-awful, and this book won't change your mind on that front.  You get so many details about needles and skin rashes and phlegm and fatigue and the joys of morphine that you begin to fear what horror awaits on the next page.<br /><br />Sorely missing is the humanity behind the death-be-not-proud swan song---the man who is a husband, a father, a brother, a friend and the man who is looking down the barrel of a gun.  Maybe Hitchens wanted to protect the privacy of his loved ones and maybe his personal fears were too terrible to verbalize, but by keeping us at arm's length, he depersonalizes his narrative, and leaves readers wondering why he wrote the book.  What insight there is comes from his selection of quotations and poetry; Hitchens had great taste in both literature and philosophy, so this may not count as a fault.  But given his prodigious intellect and his talent for deep thinking, I was hoping for more authenticity and reflection.  In fairness, few of us would want to acknowledge that we are winding up Act 3, which could be why he never takes us much below the surface of the day-to-day medical ministrations.<br /><br />I miss Christopher Hitchens and was hoping to find him here, but there's only a shadow.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|This was an enjoyable movie to watch. I had seen it before on TV but wanted it for my collection.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I'm very happy this exists because I was disappointed after spending 3 bucks buying on kindle not being able to use on Lexus 7.
B009J2VR3Y|3.0|And that's the trouble with \\"The Best of Whitney Houston\\". It has a lot of her classics on 1 disc. Really, it's the same disc as disc one from her first Greatest Hits collection, except this one includes a couple of previously unreleased tracks, neither of which is very good. \\"Never Give Up\\" just makes me sad because it's such a weak way to close out the disc, and even more depressing to think that the last \\"new\\" song we may ever hear from Whitney is some throw-away produced by one-trick pony Jermaine Dupri.<br /><br />Now, there are plenty of other great Whitney songs that this single-disc version of this album denies us. You have to get the deluxe version (which appears to be available only as an import for some reason) to get \\"Run to You\\", \\"Step By Step\\", \\"Queen of the Night\\" and even \\"Million Dollar Bill\\". Frankly, you may as well download the second disc and burn it because for some reason they left those of us here stateside out in the cold when it came to disc 2. Why that is, I have no idea. It's peculiar. You have to find your own solution to get the full best of her collection, which I did.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved reading this book. It delved into the periods and reasons before, after, and during world war I. Through the lifes of various people in different casts of life. Absolutely facinating, informative, and a great story.
B009OA57MI|1.0|The F18 Carrier landing was APP of day and I was hooked.  Great experience on my Kindle Fire.  I then tried out Air Navy Fighters (lite) and also had a great experience with the use of weapons.  Then I purchased Air Navy Fighters and I'm regretting it.  The game will be fine, then get stuck and lock up and force me to cold boot.  RORTOS really needs to fix this problem.  They have a great APP that has some bugs that need to be fixed and pushed out.  If it was not for these bugs, it would be 5 stars.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Very disappointed because app only runs on Kindle not on other devices as well.  Very dissatisfied with the multi-device scam.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This review is from the perspective of someone who has played the PS2 version of Persona 4, P3FES, and P3P.<br /><br />Of the 4 games that I consider the modern SMT school RPG's, Persona 4 Golden is hands down, the most polished experience. In fact it is the best Shin Megami Tensai RPG... actually it is the best RPG on the VITA.<br /><br />Wait, no that's not quite right. P4G is actually the game of the year.<br /><br />Story: the basic storyline is the same as the first iteration of the game. You are involved in a circle of high school friends gathered together to try to solve a murder mystery in a small town. While not the most innovative, the plot in P4G is far removed from normal fantasy/sci-fi quests in typical JRPG or Western RPG games. However, the plot twists and discoveries made throughout the game about the central mystery greatly extend the intrigue and will have you pushing forward just to find out what happens next.<br /><br />Characters: Perhaps the most important aspect of RPG's is the characters. Persona 4 Golden maintains the excellent cast from the first game and extends it by introducing Marie, a new character reminiscent of Elizabeth from Persona 3. Marie is sarcastic, poetic, and feisty. She's awesome. For those new to Persona 4, the characters really bolster the story and make the game not just about leveling up to become more powerful in battles, but also about developing relationships and really interacting with the entire cast.<br /><br />Gameplay: The excellent gameplay in Persona 4 (which I consider much superior to Persona 3 FES) returns. In addition, you get multiplayer !!! (that's right) elements introduced with the SOS function. This is kind of reminiscent of Dark Souls or Demon Souls, where the multiplayer element is not required to finish the central story of the game, but adds depth to the gameplay. In general, Persona 4 Golden is a turn based game based around mastering elemental attacks, conditions, combinations (including pairedattacks when using certain characters), and smart usage of items.<br /><br />Video/Audio: The graphics are simply stunning. On the VITA's OLED screen, the amount on which P4G improves upon any other SMT game is absolutely awesome. Now all we need is a true 1080p+ home console SMT game (Persona 5 on the next gen consoles, please?) Audio wise, the excellent score and very good English voice casting returns. I'm going to have to chime in like others and say one thing about Chie's voice actress -- she really could have used a bit more restraint.<br /><br />Replay value: A lot.<br /><br />So why is this the game of the year? Persona 4 Golden will provide you between 60-70 hours of gripping storytelling, engaging gameplay, and fascinating discovery. You will be glued to the beautiful OLED screen of the Vita passing long hours without realizing it. You will miss classes, call in sick to work, ignore you girlfriend, and forget to eat. You will love this game and realize just how shamelessly inadequate the polish of nearly every other JRPG released on current gen consoles and handhelds has been.<br /><br />If you do not have this game, and have a VITA... Why? Click the cart link on this page and if you have Prime, pay the $3.99 for 1 day shipping. You will simply not regret this decision.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Great music great price I am  a huge fan, check out their stuff on you tube. Bacon that is all
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this puzzle game.  The puzzle/challenges were fun and even, at times, a bit difficult.  The only negative, if any, is the game was a bit short.  But, I would still recommend this one, especially since it's the free app of the day!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is no great work of literature, but it delivers.  Easy to read and compelling.  I have recommended it to a few friends.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow- ladies you need to hide this one - especially from the kids, a XXXX, but very entertaining for adults
6305428352|3.0|Mr. Holland's Opus is a modestly enjoyable story about the life and career of a music teacher, who aspires to compose the perfect symphony, while teaching generations of students Music Appreciation, and coping with the handicap of his deaf son. There are heartwarming moments, uplifting and inspirational moments, and tearful moments. But, on the whole, the storyline, characters, and plot seem to be generic and formulaic.  The standard music montages segue the story from one era to another... beginning in the 50's and going up to the 90's. In general, Mr. Holland (played fairly well by Richard Dreyfuss) is portrayed as a passionate music teacher and an inspiration to his students. But, the truth is that he is a bad father, who only takes an interest in his son's life when his son is an adult. He is beligerent to anyone who doesn't share his vision. He has a flirtatious relationship with an 18-year-old singing starlet, even writing a song for her. And the symphony he finally writes is just a generic musak piece, with no passion or feeling. There is nothing unique or outstanding about Mr. Holland... either his life or his story. Still, it is touching and enjoyable, for the most part. But, for a movie which had all the potential to be a heartwarming and inspirational story, it falls quite short of its potential.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|At her very best always, this DVD delivers her voice clearly.  Great balance of close-ups and audience reaction to performance. So well done!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I LOVE this game! Its fun and addicting!!! The only downside is I beat it too easily, then have to wait for an update. I do wish they would update it more often.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|What a wonderful surprise of a movie. I rarely buy a movie but this one has to go into my collection. There is so much top-notch art direction, fantastic KICK-ASS action, and over all CGI sci-fi production quality that this movie should have been a bigger hit than what it did in the theaters. If you don't care for the story line, then at least watch it for the high level grade A+++ CGI and art direction. This movie was different enough from the original to stand on it's own. OUTSTANDING! I was left wanting more... a sequel? YES! PLEASE!!!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|For some reason very difficult to locate this type of card, but found it here and got it quickly, now I have much more capacity.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|A quick review, Like so many others I love Big Bang. Since the first episode I ever watched I was hooked.  I remember when I saw the first commercial for the show before it had ever aired I thought \\"oh great, a show that's going to make fun of the nerd community.\\" But how wrong I was.  This show embraces what makes the collective amazing.  Comic fans aren't just weirdos who live in their parents basements, geeks can get the girl, a PHD isn't required to be a member of the group, incredibly shy people can be really cute, and abnormally smart anti social people can still function and even have a friend or two.  All while enjoying life, doing normal things, playing games, clubbing, dating, proving string theory.  Ever person in the cast brings something to the table.  Each Character is extremely funny, likable, and quirky.<br />So much can be said about the show but nothing as informative as watching it.
034580404X|5.0|WOW! What a read! I have never read an erotic book in my life, and I'm exceeding pleased that I read this trilogy. The lead characters were so wonderfully sweet, exciting, yet flawed that I found myself weeping many  times as I was reading. I thank E. L. James for giving us such a poignant, heart-breaking, thrilling character such as Christian Grey. If only he was real! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!!!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|angry birds star wars is an epic game.new features like lightsabers. and the force. followed by,the melaneum falcon (filling in for the mightey  eagle) but the thing is you get two worlds.and you have to pay for the third map( path of the jedi Wichita is where he learns the force in the movie)so for kindle fire users you have to pay in all $5 for the game not even counting the milaneum falcons.so the money is a let down but in all the game is reccomended but don't buy the map pack all together play the first two worlds and see if you want the map.(plus I think if you play the first two levels you get the third one free but I think you have to get three stars in all levels so you might as well buy the map) hope this reveiw Helps  your decition.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|No other word than it is fantastic. Melody, guitar, voice. For me The best CD for 2012. the first one was amazing. The second is as good you may have expected.

B009HELT3C|3.0|Less witty than the previous ones, entertaining none the less. Brolin was great. The ending tear jerker was ridiculous but I imagine some will like it.
B003TT2X72|1.0|STOP!<br /><br />Do not make the mistake I did.  I bought this because the product page stated this was the extended version on blu-ray.  It was not.  If it is important to you, make very sure you are purchasing what you want.  I did not research this and trusted amazons description which states it is a branch style extended version.  This was only the theatrical release.  For the Two Towers, if it says 170-180 minutes, it is the theatrical version.  if it is over 220 minutes, then it is the extended.  I am very disappointed in amazon for saying that I was purchasing the extended version in their description when it was ONLY the theatrical.  The \\"What do you Get\\" section is WRONG for theatrical version.  Amazon providing an in-accurate product page caused me to purchase the wrong version.  The 1 star is due to amazon selling me the theatrical while describing it as extended.  Thusly the product is not as described.
B004MC0FO8|3.0|I have SoundHound on my phone this app looks similar.  If it is I will like it a lot.  I have heard some saying to use Shazam others saying to use SoundHound,  I now have the best of both worlds I guess.
0061906220|5.0|As a kindergarten teacher and mother of 2, I have read A LOT of children's books.  This has to be one of my absolute favorites!  My students, kids, and I have spent countless hours reading this book and dancing to the adorable song found on the publishers website. The first time I read this book I thought it was cute and had a nice, much needed message about not getting upset when things go wrong.  However, when I heard the song that goes with this book, I was completely sold!  I am now a huge Pete the Cat fan!  I was super excited when they came out with the next two Pete the Cat books that are equally wonderful!
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|This is Fiona Apple's best album so far. The songs are some of her strongest work on a par with her greatest works. The arrangements are a bit more straightforward than her last album, but highly creative and the musicians [especially the drummer] are simply excellent.

1616960922|5.0|This 180 page novella packs just as much imagination in as Sanderson's full lengthy novels.  The magic system is very well thought out, interesting and very original.  The characterizations and the story fit together tightly and seemlessly, and the story has a certain charm; it just feels right or complete.  It feels like its written at a more sophisticated level than Mistborn (which even fans like me should admit is a little over simplistic in spots) and also Stormlight and Elantris.  It almost feels like a little work of art -- as if, because of the short length, Sanderson was able to polish it to a depth not possible in his full length novels.<br /><br />Now 180 pages is 180 pages, and the story doesnt really have much in the way of action. However, that is really the only thing that is missing.<br /><br />At $4.99, its hard to recommend a 180 pager over Sanderson's full length novels, which are also terrific, but I think this will be enjoyed by almost all fans -- with the possible exception of those drawn to Sanderson by his skill with high octane action in Mistborn and Stormlight, which is mostly absent here.

B00104W8T6|5.0|I bought this CD for my sister who loves the movie and has listened to this soundtrack over and over again. She loves it, she even got me hooked. It's a quirky, folksy soundtrack that goes absolutely perfectly with the movie. If you loved the movie, then you'll love the soundtrack.
B006QPX7UI|5.0|Based on one of the best history books ever written and lives up to that standard. Tom Berenger as Longstreet captured the essence of the man completely.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|The bluray film is fine, but the 3D version had only a green or blue hue, no color at all, and lots of bursts of hash.  My disappointment was not attempting to play the 3D until now, end of November, when it is too late to return the item, so I purchased it again from Amazon and will definitely play the 3D right away!  My equipment:  one Oppo 3D, one Panasonic 3D, a new Panasonic 48-inch 3D TV in my bedroom.  The basement has a full blown movie theater with big cinepro amps, etc.  Great movie on bluray except he left out how the space jockey gets back into his chair as we saw him in Alien.

0375826726|5.0|I bought the book for my sister who is a huge fan of Christopher Paolini, and she was ecstatic to receive this as a christmas present. These books are excellent, I've even read a few and they are great. I definitely recommend them!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as good a read as the first book, but still worthwhile.  Now onto book three to see what the \\"mockingjay\\" does next!
0316069434|4.0|I had a friend whose last name was Smith. His parents wanted to name him something less common and he looked pretty good so they chose Fantastic. Naturally this name made him the brunt of jokes throughout his life so when he got old he told his wife not to put Fantastic on his gravestone. When he died she had one made up that said \\"F Smith\\" then \\"In 30 years of marriage he was never unfaithful to his wife\\". Everyone that saw that said \\"That's Fantastic\\". That's how I felt about this story. He starts out with a 20 year old murder during the L.A. riots and a bullet casing and puts it all together. Gun people would get a clue from the make and model of the gun. Finally, Harry seemed like a bit of a wimp in his dealings with his daughter and girl friend. For example he takes his daughter to a gun training facility where some sort of laser gun is used to simulate a handgun in shoot or don't shoot situations. She does very well except makes a mistake in one case and instead of saying \\"you did great, no one is perfect in these exercises\\" he acted like this was awful and he shouldn't have brought her because her feelings might be hurt. There were other similar situations. Harry is not cut out for marriage and children so he feels guilty about how he's handled things. So all in all a pretty good read but a fantastic plot and Mr. Connolly may have spent too much time with Hollywierd types giving Harry a personality now that doesn't quite fit.
B0041KVZ1I|2.0|I just got one as a gift, purchased locally, and it is not what I know from my CD copy (I'm not old enough to have heard it first on vinyl) - I haven't listened to all of side 1, but Come Together is lacking vocals at least (like the mix is off).<br /><br />Side 2, the first 2 tracks (Here Comes The Sun and Because) seem to be ok (Here Comes The Sun is my favorite song and it seems on par) but after that, the tracks are nonsense. The verse vocals from \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" is very quiet and muffled, and the chorus vocals are blasting in my face. I was hoping it was a bad pressing and not my new table (also a gift, AT-LP120) so I'm *sort* of glad to hear this. Might rather have an original than this remaster...<br /><br />It doesn't just seem like a bad pressing, it seems like a bad master, like someone went nuts with buss compression... Though I know little about the vinyl medium, so maybe that's what a bad pressing sounds like. I don't have excessive static, though. I plan to exchange it for a replacement, and plan to update this when I get my new copy. It is a 2012 Digital Remaster, as far as I can tell.
B00846REIS|5.0|Really easy reading!!! Read the books in record timing !!!!  Can't wait for the 3rd installment! May cant be here soon enough!
6305433909|5.0|This movie is fun, funny, and moving! You don't have to have seen the first one in order to enjoy this one, though.<br /><br />Sister Mary Clarence (Whoopi Goldberg) is at it again!  She's back dressing as a nun, this time to teach a bunch of unruly kids at an inner city school how to sing (at be better people, in the process).  Bonus: Lauryn Hill gets in on the singing action as Rita, a girl who loves to sing, but whose mother thinks it's an unworthy profession.<br /><br />If you loved the first one, if you love musical movies, if you love Whoopi Goldberg, or if you just like nuns, definitely check this movie out!
B009E3EY4M|4.0|Quite an extraordinary package: on the one hand the Cd's of the show and on the other hand the Blu-ray (or DVD depending on what you bought). This is the document of a one-off event where Led Zeppelin reconvened for onelast concert a few years ago. as such it is quite good. I was never an ultra-big fan of the group since I found the production often lacking in bite and had some trouble with  the way Plant used to sing. Also this was kind of the music people would listen to where they were young, only to move on to classical music later. But here they have adapted their songs and kept a really modern sound so that it is incredibly good instead of being bombastic and boring. The group rocks like very few I have seen. It is evident that John Paul Jones is a musician in quite another class, clearly the best of the group and this is obvious when he plays the keyboard or the bass. the incredible parts are when the group play with him on keyboards and there is no bass: here jason Bonham proves to be an incredible rhythm section all by himself. also Robert plant seems to have learned to sing in a much subtler way during his solo years. It is an extremelypleasant concert that rocks out very hard. The only slightly unnerving thing is the continuously changing perspective of the cameras but at least it does not get visually boring. It is one of the essential records of the year.
1609611543|5.0|I am one of the text book cases/patients.  After 9 months on the plan, I experienced the dramatic weight and cholesterol corrections Dr. Davis is citing.  It shocks me how slow the medical community is to embrace Dr. Davis' wisdom and continues to offer us lousy advice about what constitutes a 'balanced diet'.

B000N2HCM4|4.0|This book gives a good insight into Obama's personal philosophy and worldview.  It gives a greater perspective of the motivations behind his decisions as president. Very eye opening.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I heard about the book Wonder a few months ago from a couple of the blogs I follow. Then recently talk of it has popped up on Twitter. I decided I should check it out, so I went to Amazon and downloaded the free sample for my Kindle.<br /><br />Or at least that's what I meant to do!<br /><br />In what is sure to be a happy accident, I hit the wrong button and bought the book. I am so glad I did. There is so much to love about this book! It is so moving and touches on topics I feel are so important for middle schoolers. I even talked to our media specialist about seeing if we could make this required reading for all sixth graders!<br /><br />Beginning middle school and trying to find your place and fit in can be difficult for any student, but for August, physical differences add to the challenge. As August finds his place, so do the students around him. Told from the viewpoints of several characters, the book shows the best (and worst) of middle schoolers. It is great book to begin the discussion of what each student can do to stop bullying. Wonder is truly a book filled with wonder.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I love this movie and to have it in Blu-ray was even better.  The quality and clarity of this is great! RIP Heath Ledger!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game! My kids love it. They played it for hours. It is a must for the little ones, even the Adults will love it too!
B000JCVXGE|5.0|Identity follows 10 strangers as they become stranded in a hotel during a storm; they are eventually picked off one after another by an unknown murder. Of course, the story is much deeper than that, but to avoid spoilers in this twist-full film I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story in Identity; I find it unique and intriguing. It packs many thrills, many twists, and plenty of suspense. An authentic \\"whodunit\\" film. I particularly enjoyed the isolated setting, and the dark atmosphere it creates. I also loved how many of the deaths were unexpected and often shocking to the point of being jaw-dropping; I've seen this film before and some of the scenes still surprise me. Some of the twists and story elements are a bit predictable because of the heavy foreshadowing in the beginning and occasionally throughout the film, but I'm sure some scenes and the actual ending will surprise a few. The acting was great from most of the cast, but some actors did overact a few times. The music was great, as well. There are a few plot holes in this film, but really only if you look deep enough, so it shouldn't bother many.<br /><br />Overall, Identity is a truly captivating psychological thriller; the short runtime, fast pace, and twisted storyline really demand your attention. I highly recommend purchasing this film, or renting/streaming if you're not sold yet.<br /><br />Identity has strong blood and violence, no sex or nudity.

B009X00E18|2.0|great idea poorly executed.  feels like a $14 cover and not a $44 cover. the micro-shell bottom is a winner the flimsy cardboard fold-able cover is a joke. they should of embedded a thinner version of their micro-shell material and the would have had a winner.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved it, kept you in suspense up until the final, never knowing how it will end, I'm not sure I liked  the ending but neverthe less it was a great series.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|To be honest, I'm a little torn about how I feel about this book. For every part I loved, there was an element that fell flat.<br /><br />The concept was intriguing and unique (I've never read a wolf story before), but the story dragged at parts.<br /><br />There were vivid descriptions that allowed me to create a scene in my head, but oftentimes the prose went too far for my taste. A single sentence ran on and on with \\"flowery\\" words, drowning out an inciting incident. I found myself scanning the words until the story moved forward again.<br /><br />I enjoyed the characters, but, on occasion, I'd forgot which POV I was reading. The narrative was written in the same tone for both Grace and Sam. The only real difference was that Sam's narration sometimes included lyrics (which I thought was cool).<br /><br />I loved the little details (like the temperature at the start of each chapter), but there were some details missed (Didn't Shelby bite Grace? Was she immune from being bitten before? Why wasn't she affected?). Then there were other details that very obviously foretold what was too come.<br /><br />The one thing I don't have a negative counterpart for is the romance. I loved the passion between Sam and Grace. It felt real.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a fan of Shiver. The book ties up a lot of the loose ends so I'm not entirely sure what the sequel (Linger) would be about. I'll have to read the description to see if my intrigue leads me to buy book two.

B008ELUEQC|3.0|Merry Christmas, Baby by Rod Stewart, is an enjoyable if average Christmas album. I was fortunate to purchase this as an MP3 for a very low price. I was looking forward to making the purchase and just happened to get lucky and got it on a great deal. The duet on winter wonderland with Michael Buble serves as a great recap of this entire album, it is okay, but could have been much better.  What are You Doing New Year's Eve with Ella Fitzgerald is fantastic, and another highlight is We Three Kings with Mary J. Blige. Overall this is a three star offering from Rod Stewart. If you're a collector of Christmas music like myself, you will want to have this in your collection. However, if you are looking for one great Christmas CD this holiday season, I would suggest looking elsewhere.<br /><br />Three Stars.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft, but like the title says, it have some problems. Sometimes, the game lags (but not often), and, well, this happened two or three times and it may happen again, but, I was on a world, I went off and when I went back on, most of my stuff I put on that world was gone including most of the stuff that was in my inventory, my home, and everything that was in my home! hope this review was helpful and all of you people out there that are waiting for the 0.5.0 update,  there's a seed that's originally for the ipod but works on the kindle fire called 0.5.0 that have that update. just dig straight down at spawn and find goodies like gold, iron, and diamond and make sure you don't give up digging.

B004YM6JI2|2.0|I owned Season 1 thru 6 of Supernatural. The only reason I bought this was because it was on sale for $10 and I could pay for it with the cashback I had earned through discover. Even for free though, this is still the worst season of the entire Supernatural collection.<br /><br />Where as Season 6 had many plot lines that were dropped or quickly written out, Season 7 only had one, the Leviathans, and it became old fast. And while killing Bobby may have helped raise the rating during sweeps week, it has negatively effected the show since.<br /><br />But I'm still going to give it two stars instead of one, because the dicks jokes were fabulous. Gotta love Dick.

0547884591|2.0|To call Tim a hype artist is not necessarily an insult. You can learn a lot from his style, which boils down to three constants:<br /><br />1) CONSTANT NAME DROPPING. It doesn't matter if the people aren't \\"famous\\" famous, (although we get a story about how a chef he knows met Justin Timberlake).<br /><br />Any idea, from hunting pigeons to making wax bowls (both things you probably didn't realize you were going to learn when you bought this book) is presented first by an introduction to an iconoclastic figure who discovered the optimized, underground version that they then confided to Tim.<br /><br />Tim isn't just familiar with the technique of sous-vide, he is close friends with it's \\"greatest\\" practitioners (etc).<br /><br />2) CONSTANT ECCENTRIC BOASTS / HUMBLE-BRAGS. If you've read Tim before you're used to this... he holds the record for the world's longest tango, he gains and loses 100 lbs in a month at will, he has the top 5 e-mail management techniques to boost your productivity by 437% in 3 minutes etc.<br /><br />Throughout this book on \\"cooking\\" we learn that Tim can master any language in weeks (but he has never allowed himself to be videoed having a basic conversation with native speakers in any of these, strange for someone so otherwise exhibitionist).<br /><br />We learn that Tim, unlike you and I, will probably survive the apocalyspe because he can capture bears in a trash can and cook french fries with their fat.<br /><br />Tim doesn't just successfully prepare a new dish, he earns \\"amazing sex\\" afterwards as a result.<br /><br />We learn that Tim has omniscient taste in music allowing him to match a different song (and strand of tea... sure, why not) to each dish. I'm sure my grandma and someone in Malaysia (etc.) will all universally be into Tim's song selections.<br /><br />(I can imagine accomplished cooks probably feel the same way about Tim's take on food as I do about his take on music.)<br /><br />I was also confused by his \\"grand mission\\"behind the book, to help save the environment by getting people to eat tons more meat. (He even cites a talk with Barack Obama's former chef as an inspiration.)<br /><br />Look, I don't think people's dinners should be mainly dependent on environmental impact (I'm not a vegetarian), but let's be honest, meat production, especially on a Ferris-approved scale for anything more than a sliver of humanity, means vastly more resources used and more contamination produced.<br /><br />The symphony of self-congratulation is \\"tempered\\" by try-hard self-deprecations about how he couldn't make scrambled eggs or identify basic herbs until just recently.<br /><br />The fact that he would think people should buy a treatise on gourmet cooking (and \\"nutrition\\") from a guy who didn't know how to cook until a few years ago is, I guess, about on par for a guy who thought people should take highly unconventional health advice (much of it contrary to the combined wisdom of 99% of the scientific and medical establishment) from a guy who made his first fortune selling supplements claiming to make your nerves work more quickly for martial arts fights.<br /><br />The snake oil salesman is one of America's greatest folk heroes (look no further than our politicians), and Tim Ferris is not without his charm or originality.<br /><br />He fuses the first two together with his secret sauce...<br /><br />3) UNCONVENTIONAL WHIMS AND PERSONAL RESEARCH offered up as new gospel truth.<br /><br />This was most on display in the 4 Hour Body, but that work actually underlies the 4 Hour Chef, which you need to know ahead of time if you expect to find recipes using rice, pasta, bread, normal potatoes, etc.<br /><br />You know, foods that make up the staples of life everywhere outside Greenland, especially in places like the Mediterranean or Japan, which boast the highest life-expectancies in the world, all somehow without their residents having to wear body monitors and have their blood checked for the latest trendy amino acid chain.<br /><br />I had a short back-and-forth exchange with Ferris about his high-protein diet claims a while back. (Not too easy with a guy who never answers e-mail.)<br /><br />I presented him with the results of meta-studies that showed that high protein (especially high animal protein) diets are linked to the most common causes of death - cardiovascular disease and cancer. And that, while they can jump start weight loss (because you feel fuller after eating protein) long-term adherence to such diets is also linked with declining organ function of various kinds.<br /><br />He responded by justifying his \\"food hacks\\" on \\"evolutionary\\" grounds - firstly, that human physiology evolved before we ate grains (false), and secondly that grains themselves have evolved \\"toxic defenses\\" to aid their own survival. (The latter is an inversion of reality, as grains have been selected for thousands of years to be increasingly edible by people.)<br /><br />So that's the background for his quirky dietary laws, which are assumed to be normal for all readers.<br /><br />Don't worry, because he has other experts back him up who also have books you can read and supplements you can buy, and he tested it all out on his own blood and found that he became a superman in the process. (Don't pay attention to pictures of him, even those in the book, that make him look a lot older than his actual age.)<br /><br />WHY DID I READ THIS?<br /><br />I actually admire Tim's over-sized ambitions. The 4 Hour Work Week's core message that time and freedom are true wealth was a breath of fresh air for me. Despite scamminess in his examples and mechanics, his encouragement to apply emerging technology to one's work life to maximize freedom was inspirational to me.<br /><br />The 4 Hour Body saw him return to his (extra virgin) snake oil roots, but still had some good basic tips about cutting down on empty calories and introducing more vegetables to your diet, as well as how to getmore out of less time spent exercising.<br /><br />I searched in vein for such simplifying lessons in this book. Instead I found a boyish obsession with the use of \\"extreme\\" and uncommon ingredients like glycerin and eel. That kind of long-tail culinary thematics plus the \\"paleo\\" dogma constitutes quality a la The Four Hour Chef. Not exactly comfort food, or something that will simplify your life or budget<br /><br />I did learn about braising, which as Tim says is tasty and allows for large margins of error in cooking time. I may also get a meat thermometer.<br /><br />That's where the second star came from, and the book is so massive that most people can probably pick up a trick or two like that that appeals to them personally<br /><br />Just make sure you're an expert in speed reading before you try to find those. Don't worry, Tim is already, and he definitely reminds you of that in this book.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|This was one of my least favorite John Corey novels.  I did enjoy John's off the cuff/wisecrack remarks.  However, I kept waiting for the &#34;big payoff&#34; which was concluded in little more than a few paragraphs.  The Lion far surpassed this as did Nightfall.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game is to addicting. I wan`t to read my book but I'm addicted to this game. Most games I play are fun but subway surfers is the most adicting game I've ever played before.

B005M4EM5S|5.0|As a book it is wonderful. It is even better as an audiobook because the readers really bring the characters alive. I've enjoyed long car drives for the first time because I can listen to this. Brandon Sanderson is an amazing author, and I'd recommend any of his work to those who like fantasy with interesting magic systems. The worlds he creates are unique, and the people and animals populating them are very different from ours. The length that might throw a reader off from this book is great as an audiobook, and it is never boring.

B004XGN8W4|4.0|Overall, this is a wonderfully made product!<br /><br />1) Size, weight and transport:<br /><br />About the size of two briefcases stacked together. It is easy to carry considering its bulk and what it houses (we have PS3 as well as all the accoutrement).<br /><br />Weighs a little over 10lbs by itself and with the game console and accessories, easily another 5lbs. While it is not heavy for me to carry. It is NOT designed for laps.<br /><br />I find it easier to use the handle than the strap (It does NOT come with straps, but I had plenty of straps laying around. So I hooked up two key-hooks to the latches' baggage/luggage lock-loops and then hooked up a strap over it).The strap option was not that comfortable and it makes the case swing when I walk. It also makes me feel like I have to clutch it tight; otherwise, it would fall off my shoulder. Looping it over my neck gives me strap burn and is extremely uncomfortable.<br /><br />2) Protection and Security:<br /><br />Its hard plastic is durable. But it does scratch easy. However, it does a good job protecting what's important: Your game console. Its built in screen seems well housed in also.<br /><br />I have only dropped this twice from about 3 feet. And was glad nothing cracked or broke inside, including the screen itself.<br /><br />The two lockable latches are fast to attach and detach with an option to place baggage/luggage locks on it.<br /><br />3) capacity:<br /><br />For its dimensions, it did a great job utilizing all the spaces. The two storage bags on the sides hold one controller each and the USB cable as well as power/HDMI cable along some other minor cables that you need. If you are thinking about a noise reducing headphone or more controllers, you are looking at cramming them in that might damage your cords. You can place them on top of the gaming unit itself, but that will be very tight plus you run into scratching your monitor.(you can cram two controllers in one bag, but I would NOT recommend it)<br /><br />I'd say comfortably: holds TWO controllers and their USB cords, two plugs (one for the case for its monitor, and the other for the gaming console). A couple of HDMI cords(one for backup). You definitely want to consider buying a multiple outlet for the plugs as sometimes it is hard to find a place that would have two open outlets for the console and the case.<br /><br />4) A/V:<br /><br />Video quality is pretty good if you don't compare it to a 120hz 1080 HD TV. At very very high speed, there could be a slight line or lag. But barely noticeable unless you are absolutely anal about perfection. But for on the road, this is wonderful. You can adjust the settings on the monitor. Which is a nice plus. I do worry about scratching the screen. But have been extremely careful.<br /><br />Audio quality is decent. When you are close to the console, the sound is rich enough that you aren't missing out. I prefer to use the headphones when I use this console anyways. But for those times that you don't want to use a headphone, the sound is decent.<br /><br />5) Console placement:<br /><br />The PS3(it has to be SLIM)fits snuggly in the unit and there is a strap to secure it. Perhaps a little bit too snug. As I find the heating issue does happen. Highly recommend buying a tiny fan to direct the heat. The front where you have to plug in the USB can be a bit of a nuisance to maneuver especially if you are getting into the multi-player/dongles.<br /><br />6) Not just for gaming consoles:<br /><br />We have tablets/smart phones that use mini/micro HDMI. They all work with this case. (you have to buy the cables). Our Panasonic Blu-Ray(not 3D) DVD player works with the case (for the times when our kids are using the PS3 on the big TV and we take out the old Blu-Ray and use this case for it).<br /><br />One of the best things that I use it for is for when I am on the road, my kids, of course, have the PS3 at home. But I bring this case and I plug in my smart phone. I now havea 15\\" screen to watch my netflix that I can stream in a 4G network. Sometimes, when I am taking a break, I stay in my van, plug this case into my 120 vote outlet and plug my smart phone in it to catch a show on netflix or use any of my apps for games or to read the news or surf the net or Facebook.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />In the past few months, I have seen this case drop as low as $179.00. And it's average lightning round price is about $199.00.<br /><br />I suspect it will go lower in the next few month so unless you are in a rush to have portable gaming on your console. I'd wait for a lightning round or a price drop until it is below its $230ish price tag.a 15\\" screen to watch my netflix that I can stream in a 4G network.

It contains all the CCR songs I remember from my younger days (plus a few I had not heard before), and they sound just like I remember them from those earlier times. I especially like \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" and \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine.\\" For anyone who liked CCR back in the 60s, I believe this would be a great album to have.

B007HACDLK|3.0|After being soundly concussed, our hero morphs from a unidimensional cardboard cut-out to a real person. The cliches fade as Rapp recovers from a head injury and becomes a more approachable, always effected avenger.
B0097RF3X6|5.0|This album is pure beauty. The new songs that Karen brings to her Hotel Souza are simply superb. While \\"Paris\\" and \\"Night Demon\\" are my personal favorites I must admit that the arrangements on \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\\", \\"Dindi\\" and \\"My Foolish Heart\\" are simply amazing and add to these classics a new approach.<br />Karen, without doubts, is the sexiest and coolest vocalist of the moment.<br />My advice, listen to \\"Hotel Souza\\" on repeat!
0425263916|5.0|I completely loved this book! It kept me interested from beginning to end. It was so good, that I read it in one night. Can't wait until the next one comes out!
B002QBS9KE|3.0|I love the difference in the sound quality when I use the sponge cover vs not.<br />I also had a very difficult time putting the sponge cover on the adaptor and even tore one of them before I figured out how to get the dang thing on there.<br />I would prefer to be able to purchase just the sponge covers, or to buy them already assembled.
B001AITGWE|5.0|This is a movie that I can watch again and again, its hilarious with a serious twist at the end. Michael Douglas was truly at the top of his game on this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|kind of mindless but it draws you in<br />good game overal<br />and you get better after a couple tries .
0375507256|4.0|Was a little slow starting but it was interesting following the connection between the different eras.  Definitely made me think.  Also, much better than the movie.
B009AKI3IM|5.0|DJ Shadow is considered a key figure in the development of instrumental hip hop and this CD captures a good sampling of his works.  It's a great, mellow CD.  He is one of my favorites.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a refreshing read for anyone. Garth Nix takes beloved concepts and plot lines and combines them into something unusual and wonderful. He writes a strong female protagonist that would be an excellent role model for any young girl. The book features an interesting twist on Necromancy (raising of the dead) by making Sabriel an Abhorsen (one who returns the dead to rest).<br />The world of the Old Kingdom is detailed and feels like the reader is on the journey with Sabriel, and the magic used in the book is creative and different than what is typically expected out of such a novel.<br />I particularly love the way death is handled.<br /><br />Overall Sabriel is worth a read and comes highly recommended from me, as well as anything else written by Garth Nix.
B0090X4HES|3.0|There are several really good songs but, like most rap CDs, you can't listen straight thru.  There are lots of skits which are interesting only the first time.  #5 and #9 are both awesome though.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent season. Compelling. Scary. Cleverly grotesque. Moving. Must watch all 3 seasons! I can't believe how much time I spend thinking what I will do &#34;IF&#34;!
B007MU85D0|5.0|This is a great CD! I got it for $2.99 so that's even better! Would highly recommend to others !
B0086700CM|4.0|it is very hard for begginers but once you get the hang of it its very addicting and it has a lot of extras stuff that you don't have to get with real money
B007MU85D0|5.0|I haven't been this obsessed with a new artist for a while - probably not since Florence and the Machine.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Love this CD been a Cohen fan for years and I think this is one of his best. Would buy this again.
0525952926|2.0|It's a good story and perhaps a good review of history, but definitely not a page turner.  I would estimate it was written at the seventh/eighth grade level at best.  The storyline was simplistic and predictable.  The tragedies were treated in a matter of fact manner.  Additionally, it was oftentimes one sided in it's treatment of key issues that created social conflicts that led to the violence.  I was disappointed, and it's the first Ken Follett book I cannot recommend to family/friends, and probably won't purchase/read the last of the trilogy.
B00973CGXK|4.0|I really enjoy the killers music. Each album the band has put out has been very good. This album is a depature from the previous albums. It compares better to Age & day than Sams town or hot fuss. There are several tracks that I enjoy.
0316069434|5.0|I'm love the feeling I get when I see that there's a new Harry Bosch novel about to be published.  With my Kindle, I can download the book that same day;  and I did that w/ \\"The Black Box\\".  I thought this was one of the best plots in recent Bosch novels - an open-unsolved murder from 20 years ago leads, with several steps and good police work, in a new direction.  Unusual plot.  If you've not read a Michael Connelly novel w/ Harry Bosch as the main character - try it; this would be a good one.  I also enjoy the development of Harry's relationship w/ his daughter, Maddy, as Connelly has developed her thru her early teen years.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I did not have enough patience to go through Myst some time ago, but I enjoyed this game very much.  I finished it in a few hours (split between morning and evening).  Every time I was stuck, I was able to use hints to get me moving again.  My only dislike is that pressing Android back button closes the game and you have to restart it.  There are many games that re able to recognize the back button press as a return by one step or at least ask if you want to exit.  I pressed back button several times by force of habit which caused the game to just exit.  This was a little annoying.  Still - five stars.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best sci-fi stories I've ever read and I've read most of it. The new digital stuff is inexpensive but usually not worth even the low prices, all derivative and similar to Honor Harrington for the most part.<br /><br />Andy Weir has written a brilliant Mars survival book that is exciting and technically flawless. This is real space survival with real and accurate space science. Andy is a very intelligent writer and has a lot of info on the space program. The tale is totally upbeat in spite of the impossible odds against Mark, who has a great sense of humor about it all and is thankfully a friggin genius.<br /><br />This is a real page turner with no slow parts at all. Highly recommended for sci-fi fans and space program fans and fans of survival stories. I will be watching for anything that Andy Weir writes.
8423671267|5.0|I loved so so much. Perfect gift for this time. Excellent customer care service. Great packaging. Really nice reading. Love
0307956350|4.0|This book was an enjoyable read. It was well laid out for suspense and I was quite drawn in by the story.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|My wife and I loved watching the series on tv, this is one of those things you can watch over and over again and pick-up on something you did not catch the first time.  Well worth the small investment.  After reading some of the other reviews about disc quality, our disc set is flawless, no issues. The only reason I gave a 4 not 5 is because there seems to be some parts cut out based from  the original showtime tv series that i watched on tv. (not much but some). After receiving this order, I immediately bought two more as gifts.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app is very useful. I have used it to take notes at work, as a memory aid, to create lists etc. It is useful and full functioned for a notepad program.

B007VUA7VO|4.0|This battery app keeps me aware of critical lows, especially when I'm playing the addictive Angry Birds game! It's a keeper.
B00881VLCE|5.0|All the enjoyment of putting puzzles together without havering to pick up any pieces. No more lost pieces, I can finish the whole puzzle every time.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love the pictures available and the fact that there are so many more to choose from with little to no more charge.  I like that you choose the size of the puzzle with as few as 36 and as many as 216 pieces at a time.  really enjoy having a jigsaw available for me to pull out whenever I want!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|i totally thought that this would not live up their first album but i am so happy to hear that i was wrong. this album is just amazing and i love every song on it... AWESOME!!!
B006JSXYPA|5.0|So far the tablet has been really fun along with helpfull. I origanly got it so that my wife could access etc. That takes away the time we spend together. Our Fun is all the way of the house. Often I found it isolated. This smart thing has allowed us along with myself less restricted or confined to the back on wich it displays  me. I have never even manipulated a befor. I always thought they were very limited and could not perform the average tasks. However I have been proven wrong. Surfing !!!!

B006MW3V6U|4.0|I love this series, all the characters are fun to watch and follow. I watch it on my kindle. I bought the first season also.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|the best game out there so far. worth the full version. long playing and very clever. enjoyed the story as well even though I usually skip over that part. enjoyed it from start yo finish.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Zero rating as it does not work on fire 2nd generation.  No flash capability on the  2nd generation device.  That sucks! I hope that defect gets fixed!
1439156816|5.0|I thought being that he wrote fiction horror stories, this book would be dark.  That was my mistake.  He really seems like a happy playful guy.  This book mixes his life stories along with tips and things to remember when writing.  Excellent read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Its nice. Don't like the deaths or the ending. Great book though.<br />Nice addition to the already excellent series. I don't like the lack of a games itself
B005LAIHY0|5.0|At the cinema I was polarized: absolutely stunning visuals (especially in 3D) and sound, but a seemingly confused plot; and a lead character trashing the most evidence-established beyond dispute scientific theory on earth (Darwinian evolution) because she is a Christian and \\"[she] choose[s] to believe\\". And, somehow, this choice of belief translates to a multi-billion dollar expedition, financed only because the CEO of Weyland will clutch at any straw to prolong his life (based, it seems, upon a single person's belief system).<br /><br />What? Oh Boy! What nonsense!<br /><br />Ridley Scott did not help by stating \\"NASA and the Vatican agree that is almost mathematically impossible that we can be where we are today without there being a little help along the way\\". I cannot believe that the Vatican states this: if it did, it would have to admit that the existence of a theity is nonsense (oh, but wait, the Vatican does not understand logic or reason, only faith and cover-ups - I almost forgot!). I would hope that NASA never agrees with the Vatican - come on! (Of course, the reverse is likely to be true.)<br /><br />But, I now have the BD and, having just watched it, I am carried away (again, really). No 3D, I'm afraid, but for the first time, my 7.1 surround system is justified. This is stunning stuff.<br /><br />My original objections haven't really disappeared, but the film now makes more sense (and it is a show and a half!). Shaw's absence of a theory is trashed by just about everyone, but it turns out that she just happens to be right (a bit like winning the lottery). But OK, better that the rest of the crew trash the idea than agree it with it.<br /><br />Many people have criticized the scenes where the Prometheus collides with the alien ship, the latter falling and rolling: why don't Shaw and Meredith Vickers run sideways, we wonder? Well, this never really bothered me; in moments of crisis, people just run in panic (and do not look over their shoulder and make logical decisions - I know, I once stood and watched my son chop down a tree, only to see it hit an overhead (11 thousand volt) power line. Did either of us run? - nope, stupidly, we just stood looking. And, of course, Shaw does roll to the side at the end (phew!)).<br /><br />On the other hand, there is a really silly bit where one of the scientists tries to make friends with an alien worm-thing, as though he could talk to it like a pet dog (I couldn't see any ears). Right, very sensible! But, of course, it's designed to make you cringe and shout \\"don't be stupid, don't be stupid....\\", because you KNOW something horrible is about to happen. Just like you did when, in Alien, Ripley decided she had to go back for the cat (and how stupid is that?). A common and very effective film technique, which emphasizes your tension because you believe that you would have acted differently.<br /><br />And why do the \\"Engineers\\" (a brilliant choice of name - and surely confrontational to people of faith - please see footnote) suddenly decide that, after having seeded life on earth, they then want to destroy it? This annoyed me until I watched the BD. At the cinema, I missed Shaw saying \\"Why did you turn against us?\\". Such lines make a lot of difference, because it means that the film is aware of the perceived logic that we see, and why Prometheus and other films like it (one cannot help think of 2001: A Space Odyssey) should be re-watched multiple times.<br /><br />Mark Streitenfeld's film score is, incidentally, brilliant. It's on par with Jerry Goldsmith's scores for the original Alien (which it pays homage to) and the Omen trilogy. Highly recommended (listen to it loud).<br /><br />Scott calls the film \\"an original mythology\\", putting my mindset into the same place I put it with Flying Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a film I only appreciated when the director said [paraphrased] \\"imagine an alternate world in which people can fly\\". Of course, it's all alternate -  the only mainstream scientifically realistic SF film ever is 2001, no others need apply. If you really need convincing of this, read Stephen Baxter's \\"Ark\\".<br /><br />And watch Prometheus, again and again. It rewards as a film describing an alternate universe (just like Lord of the Rings). And it flows!<br /><br />I cannot wait for any sequel that might be forthcoming. and I continue to think that Ridley Scott is (selectively) brilliant.<br /><br />Footnote: Shaw does not seem to understand her own religion, which requires a single non-evolved God. If she believes that cave paintings and future proof of an alien race that seeded the Earth support Christianity, then she has not read her Bible. But, relax, the film is an alternate universe!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its stun app. thou beta assortment of prides and some oft them are pretty cool. there's even Teddy bears. its Coll ashen you rank up
B009YU6FJM|5.0|i never imagined that they would be able to top Diamond Eyes, it flowed so perfectly throughout the ENTIRE album but listening to Koi No Yokan is like grabbing some headphones (not \\"beats by Dre\\" lol) turning the volume up to eleven while floating on a cloud as the sunsets over the mountains... Just Sayen. :) Enjoy!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is fun i thought about getting when my friend told me about it. and then i got about a week later.
0446585041|5.0|If you love Ellen this is the book for your.  I read the entire book with a smile on my face, and finished it in a couple days.  Ellen never disappoints
B001HN6922|5.0|We were big Cars fans so naturally we needed to buy Cars2 when it came out.  A great stocking stuffer!!!
015626224X|5.0|What a surprise in less a week &#60;i have found the book I ordered in my mailbox.It is as new and the English text is farbetter than the FRENCH TRANSLATION WHICH WAS not allowed in france during many years, because Orwell depicted with accuracy the world of French&#34;grand hôtel &#34;crillon&#34;.The name was not printed but every body was aware of that.<br />thanks to the sender and his quick answer.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Any one who has seen this movie knows that it is a great story and will make for a great stocking stuffer this Christmas.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Never a dull moment, full of great laughs for the entire family.  My family has to see this every year
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Id give this a 4.5.  Never read anything like this before and im wondering if a sequel is coming.  Try it.
B0096HJXXI|3.0|If you can force yourself to not consider such logistics as how the corpses were able to get from residences to the morgue and vice versa without being observed by anyone...then this film is good, campy, gory fun in a B-movie sort of anyway.  Of course if you're a Lovecraft fan than you will love the first half.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|WHY!!!!! Is an important word when u get into the game for a little while because after a while it shuts down when your in the store now it wont even let me in the store without &quot;force closing&quot; the app...WHY!!!!!!
0802473156|5.0|Marriage therapists recommend this book. Wish I had it when I got engaged. It's light reading and easy reading. Not too preachy but an eye opener from different perspectives.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows on the air! Well written and great acting! I am hooked on this show
B004024O3I|5.0|My 3 yr old loves it so I had to buy the next size up too. Very versatile and functional. As far as I can tell it's comfortable for her too. She wears them all day at daycare and no blisters. She's picky about her shoes and she used to only wear Pedipeds since they are great for narrow feet. This is the first shoe she put on by herself when she was 2. If your child has wider feet you may want to try on in store first.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is great!my friend kaitlin reccomended it she was right this is fun and cool i love my little pony
B0087JTAKW|4.0|this was a good read - interesting - enjoyed it very much - would recommend - something different - would read again.
B00999CZKG|5.0|The Pogues in Paris Blue Ray DVD.  Who would've thought that it is the French that would hold a 3 day sold out concert of these wonderful London-Irish lads? The crowd just goes nuts beginning to end. To make the show even more posh this time they are backed by a lovely 3 piece Brass section that makes, \\"Rainy Night In Soho\\", and the others, sound the way it always should. And its in this song Shane switches the lyric, \\" Theres a light I hold before me\\"...to \\"YOU'R the light I hold before me\\" as to make a I Love You even more emphasis on the song he wrote for the love of his life of nearly 30 years, Victoria. Filmed beautifully and the sound to match, this makes THE live must have Pogues album to date not to mention the ONLY Official one. Highlights- Kitty, Irish Rover, Bottle of Smoke, Poor Paddy on the Railway, Fairytale of New York duet with Jem's daughter, brings the spirit of Kristy McColl in the house. And of course Fiesta tray headspacking and all.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I chose it because my friend said it was a good read.... yeah a bit more risque than a harlequin book. would recommend it to any woman looking for a little spice in their life,
B001BNFR6W|3.0|I love the TV series but this product is the pits.  Once you remove the discs from the packaging they do NOT go back in easily.  Season two is full of defective discs, I was only able to watch 3 episodes all the way through.  there are a couple of defects in other seasons but the episodes are watchable. I purchased S2 separately, I hope that it'll be of a better quality.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this trilogy.  It kept me on the edge of my seat while reading.  I really enjoyed it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I didn't think id like this book, but I guess I judged the book by its cover! I am officially a fan of his books.
B005LAJ16I|1.0|I bought this supposedly new. However, upon receiving the second and third Dvd were defective and the fourth one had commercials. I was forced to give one star otherwise I couldn't write a review. Very dissatisfied.
B009KYXEY6|2.0|My daughter ordered this CD thinking the three bonus songs were on it because it was labeled as such.  It seems this CD has been recalled everywhere because of the three missing bonus tracks.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|So I had this for a while and it was great but after a while I uninstallednit about anyear later I reinstaled it and it was a a lot different right now I'm level 16 but my person looks weird he is full of armour but his helmet never appears but it is a good game
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It read like a beautiful dream! I would recommend this book to all who have any doubts about the wonderful adventure that we have to look forward to after the death of our physical body.
1568363931|5.0|I liked it, but some things i did know already. However, it made it a little cleaner at how to go about making these for lunch, and i love it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I recommend this book for EVERYONE! We eat far too many processed foods and this gives you some insight on how bread and other foods we eat and think are healthy are really working against us.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Got this as a gift for cousin, he loves it! Now he is getting into more movies similar & for xmas I'm gonna get him the VOTE FOR PEDRO shirt. He has watched this movie more then 5times. XD
0810993139|4.0|This book was funny. Maybe better for older rather than younger since it does have some bathroom humor and other things. The book came in the condition it stated and arrived timely.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This was a quick read and kept the reader interested. Not as intricate as some of his other works, but fun to read.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I've never seen Avatar before (shocking, I know), however, when I bought my first blu-ray player I made it a point to buy this movie as one of the first to see.  I received it in only a few days from ordering and arrived perfectly.  Great movie and great sender!
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game is very addictive and they need to make a second game. When you come out with another game like this ket me know.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|LOVE this game! It's pointless but nostalgic and charming. I remember feeding quarters into these when I was a kind at the hopes of getting the &#34;precious gem ring&#34; or a gold coin. What a hoot!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|The game crashes on my kindle fire HD 8.9. I can't even play the game because I can't get passed the story line in the beginning. After I click continue, the game shuts down.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the free version. No better than I am at sling-shotting the birds to get the pigs, this will keep me going for a long, long time. Lots of fun!
B005HNMPBM|5.0|Keeping the legacy alive of the best element from the Marvel Stable. Riveting and sexy! Wish I could be Mystique!
B001MKQS4O|4.0|A well made film, if perhaps oversimplified in its plot and unexciting in its direction; that is engaging foremost in my mind for the ambiguity it was able to imbue into its central relationship between Capote and Smith. Hoffman is exact as always.
B00A3AU1U6|5.0|A NEW NUGGET from Brian Eno that keeps you in the moment and contemplating the power of sound and space.
B00932AA5G|5.0|I read Jo Nesbo's Headhunters a few months ago and found it to be a fast-paced thriller that combined the world of multi-million dollar (in this case, kroner) executive talent scouts, art thievery, murder, corporate intrigue, and, above all, deceit.  While the story could have easily reached 700+ pages, Nesbo forces his story into only 304 pages.  After reading Headhunters, I learned that the film adaptation of the book was set to be released.  I couldn't wait to see it.<br />I was hesitant at first to watch a film that is almost entirely Norwegian in dialogue (there are a few lines of English) with subtitles because I felt that the constant reading of the lines would take my focus away from the visual medium and cause me to miss some of the action.  Prior to watching this film, I watched the Millenium trilogy in Swedish and these worries about the language barrier were put to rest.<br />Overall, the film stays very true to the book.  As with all films, creative changes were made, but I was very pleased to see my favorite moments from the book played out on the screen.  What I had only been able to imagine before was played out before my eyes in this great movie.
B0046B4VXQ|5.0|This epoch movie about the outsider from Stephen King discovering her ability to stand up to the powers at play in HS makes for a rich experience.
055338466X|4.0|I originally wanted to read this book to see what Stephen Hawking thought about God and the Universe.  Little did I know, but that would be only a little part of the book.  Mr. Hawking really goes through a history of science, and then explains different topics from waves to quantum physics.  It will absolutely make you think about the Universe in a different way.  I really did enjoy the book.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|Frankly this movie was terrible. Echoing other reviews I agree that the acting was terrible, the plot was inherently unbelievable and the ending was an embarrassment to film. Blake Lively was especially bad and her character was so two dimensional I couldn't stop laughing at it. I haven't read the book so at first I thought Stone was trying to channel some tarantino and just failed miserably, but after reading other reviews it seems he just botched the translation from book to movie.<br /><br />Basically I just want to say DO NOT PAY FOR THIS SHIT.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Well written semi-thriller, this book kept me hooked.  Certainly when you start on the journey, the end you get is no what you would expect.  Don't ruin it for yourself, just trust the star ratings and go forth and read the book.
B008VBYN80|3.0|kingdoms and lords for the kindle tablet is a good game. Distracting and time consuming. It is a the kind of game that if you a fantasy book reader, you would like this game. Build your own town, expand your territories and fight battles. Good way to pass the time.

B002JM1VJG|1.0|I have read everyone's disappointment with this terribly incomplete set. I did not buy this for a reason. All Madonna's videos are available on thepoppalace.com. Its a 7 disc set. It has justify my love,erotica,and american life uncencored. It also has tons of live footage. It goes all the way to 4 min to save the world. Current vids from mdna are available in other compilations. The set is $50. The quality is exellent.

0142501123|5.0|My 4-year-old daughter loved this book around Halloween.  She had a good bit of it memorized, we had read it so much.  The ending is funny, too.  It is a little bit scary, but she was okay with it, and she does not like books and TV shows that have anything scary in them.

B007KOYEOC|4.0|The book starts out with Ana and Christian on their honeymoon. They spend three weeks jetting across Europe and wrapped in each others arms every chance they get. It's so beautiful too, the love they have for each other. Christian is determined to give Ana the rainbows and butterflies she wants....and she gets it the entire book. Christian loves Ana probably more than life itself, yet she doubts it all the time. It's so romantic how much he loves her, truly. Only if all the woman in the world could be loved the way Fifty loves Ana. I thought these was a great third installment.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|It is what it is. Most know from films and other accounts how the SEALs are recruited and trained. Also, there isn't much that isn't known about how they got Osama. But, having these accounts expressed from a participants point of view make it more immediate and interesting. As a bonus, the writer also covers other operations that had nothing to do with Osama. Some were more interesting than the finale on a participant's personal level. Still, it moves right along and there are a few surprises revealed after Osama was taken down.

B009VB9VKY|2.0|That's how I defined it for my wife before we watched it, but there was actually a purpose to this flick.  I liked it ok, but it was slow a bit too often.  The rating comes from my wife, so I guess the eye candy (male strippers) wasn't enough at all.
0316228532|5.0|I do not understand those who said the characters were slow to develop and were too many. This book is a really great read, taken in slowly to develop the complex relationships between all of the many characters. A real slice of life from low to high and the real lives led by so many different people. It is not a cheerful feely good book, tragic in it's content, but truthful to life.<br />People who did not like the book simply did not have the patience to watch the plot unfold to it's horrific and sad ending. This author knows how to write more than children's fantasy books. Hope she writes more of this kind.

0451197879|2.0|This is perhaps King's worst effort. Or if there is one worse, I can't think of it. The plot isn't particularly imaginative -- just about a working stiff slowly losing it, and the writing it takes to get there is just plain bad. I'd be willing to bet that half the people who review this book could do better. Yeah, that bad. And tedious! The unfolding of the unravelling of the inevitable happening is so slow and so unreasonable and so full of old, tired, imitative cliches, that all we want is for him to just get on with it already, so we can start a new book. No surprises, nothing original to engage us. My head got a stomach ache. Definitely the worst of the so-called Bachman books. Ranks along Rose Madder and Insomnia as one of King's top worst books. Worth purchasing if it's part of a collection -- but on its own? Are you crazy?! Never! Don't do it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i like this appp it has a really nice to draw full attention to you . you should reallly get this app, alrighty now im eating applesauce so ee ya later.... GET THIS APP!!!!
0393927938|5.0|First, be sure you get the right edition. It's not like the original is hard to read -- so why in the world do we have all these terrible abridgements floating around? To cater to children, for whom the original would not be all that scary in the first place?<br /><br />This is a fine, well-written book, before it is a horror book. Recognize that, if nothing else. The author is no hack who just happened to stumble over a great idea one night. It's a literary piece that has a horrific subject matter, that's all.<br /><br />Also, it will not resemble the old campy Frankenstein movies, with the crazed mad scientist and the lightning forks. Instead, we have a sane, though perhaps slightly obsessed, scientist experimenting with electricity and dead matter. When his efforts prove more successful than he ever imagined, he flees in abject horror -- and that is the plot of this book.<br /><br />The thing he made, neither alive nor dead, but a kind of matter without soul (because after death, the author believed, the soul departs to other realms), proceeds to stalk its maker, not as a lumbering monster, as Hollywood portrayed him, but as a kind of abandoned child. Rebuffed, humiliated, anguished, he eventually conceives a great hatred for Frankenstein and resolves to revenge himself upon him, come what may. He murders Frankenstein's wife to ensure that his creator will suffer as he does -- alone in the cold world with never a friend or companion to turn to.<br /><br />Eventually, Frankenstein tracks his \\"son\\" to the arctic, which is where the novel ends.<br /><br />Years ago, Robert DeNiro played the monster in a more or less faithful adaptation of this story, but that is as close as Hollywood has come so far. So to get the true story, the story as it was meant to be; well, we still have to read it. And I'm fine with that.
0439023491|5.0|I liked this book however the 2nd one was so annoying! I did like the movie better though but the book is nice too!
0451196716|5.0|One of King's earliest works, so it's a bit clumsy, like the first stories he published in \\"men's magazines\\" way back in the day. But idea behind it is typical King; dark, twisted, and almost wholly original. It centers on a contest of endurance where to fail is to die, but to succeed is probably to die too; just later, and after a lot more painful travail.<br /><br />In a post-Apocalyptic world, young male competitors (boys, really), many of whom don't have anything else to lose, arrive from various points around the country to participate in a what is called a \\"long walk\\" for possible fame, fortune, and imperishable glory. But probable death. The rules are pretty simple: the group begins to walk, and whoever gets tired or just can't keep up the pace (for example, gets a cramp or a blister), is eliminated from the competition -- permanently -- by the armed guards escorting the contestants. Apparently, there can be only one winner, so the walk will go on and on until everyone but one has been shot; although as the story proceeds, we begin to doubt that winning is a possibility for anyone at all. We start to think that the game is rigged and these prizes are illusory and past winners myths men have made in order relieve the tension, or boredom, or whatever.<br /><br />Obviously, it's a purely symbolic story, but maybe that's one of the reasons why it's so good; it's unapologetically symbolic. It's not pretending to other things.<br /><br />It's also a tale told by a King before he was the King we know him as today, and so it is more interesting than many of his other stories. It's a lot like the first Dark Tower book, in that way. The King here is just a college nobody, no fame, no fortune himself. Just one of the many millions grinding away in the mill. And a grinding obsession in himself to learn how to tell a good tale.<br /><br />And this book, which is really more of a long short story, is a good tale, based on a solid foundation. Some mistakes here and there, yes, some cracks in the walls, so to speak, but still a good story.<br /><br />It gets more and more unsettling as it goes along, particularly when the contestants begin to hallucinate, and we find out that one of them may be the son of whatever sick despot rules this world (why is he in the \\"contest\\"?), and King describes with a sort of glee happy crowds cheering at the very glimpse of these sick, straggling children -- which is probably why The Long Walk eventually became a so-called Bachman Book.<br /><br />On a side note, this has a lot in common with The Running Man, which is another very early King book.

0316069434|4.0|\\"The Black Box\\" has a credible protagonist in LA Detective Harry Bosch and an intriguing storyline involving the 20-year old murder of a foreign journalist in the midst of the South Central riots of 1992.  The two elements come together as Bosch works in the cold case division of the LAPD.  As it happens, he was with the unit that was called to the scene of the journalist's murder, but was able to do little investigating into the brutal killing at the time because of the ongoing mob violence.  His regret at that failing adds passion to his pursuit of the cold case investigation.  Author Michael Connelly cunningly spins out a well-wrought police procedural that moves initially from focus on the Black gangs of South Central to a group of suspects further afield in California.<br /><br />It's highly satisfying to watch the weaving together of this tale that has few false notes, a blissful lack of contrived drama and the absence of an over-dependence on sheer violence or bodily damage to the protagonist.  This is an intelligent story that delivers a credible and action full ending.  This was my first Connelly novel and I will definitely take a look at his other books.  Really good writing!
B00457WZEI|5.0|Just what the doctor ordered!

0061474355|5.0|I read Sabriel a few years after it first came out... I was a kid at the time, growing up in the thick of Harry Potter fever, and there were tons of fantasy novels on the shelves. I remember being really struck by the uniqueness of Sabriel even back then, and how it dealt with death in this beautiful, poetic way. It also helped having a badass female lead.<br />Fast forward many years later, and I find myself returning to Sabriel again and again. Even as an adult, the book still resonates with me, and I honestly appreciate the way it handles Death and the zombie-like creatures in a way that's thoroughly unclich&eacute;d in today's \\"post apocalyptic bloodbath\\" trend.<br />Honestly, in the time since I first read Sabriel, and now, I've read more fantasy novels and comics than most people should.  I work as an animator and a writer. And I'm still so impressed by Nix's world building and characters. It holds up as one of the best fantasy novels of the last couple of decades.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This author has a reputation and history, and although I was not overwhelmed, I felt it fulfilled my expectations.  Soap opera drama, love triangles, and mystery...

0399157565|3.0|I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan and particularly \\"Kay Scarpetta\\" for many, many books but I must say I am disappointed with The Bone Bed.  Cornwell seems to be sacrificing the plot for self-analysis.  If the reader is not a reasonably long term reader of the Scarpetta novels, I feel, they would be lost in all the angst and ruminating of the characters by Scarpetta. A surprise killer is great if there is some ground work laid for the \\"head slap\\" at revelation and \\"Of course,how did I miss that!?\\"  Not this time.  Maybe it was just me, but my response was, huh? where did that come from? I am also thinking a combination of readers might work better in the future IF the stories get better.<br />S. Lawson
B0053O89KG|5.0|It was an amazing season of Castle with every episode carrying over to the amazing season ending episode.  Love the bloopers too...always a great addition to the dvds.
B004LUHQ1G|3.0|Don't get me wrong with the title of this review, I've liked the Foo Fighters from the debut album to One by One but after that it seemed like each album after that became more and more inconsistent or less inspired. The trend regretfully continues here.<br /><br />About half of this 11 song album is actually really good and has heart along with good songwriting, musicianship, and passion. The other is either just average songs that feel like Dave Grohl didn't really care about what he was singing about or how the song sounded OR they just were bad/generic songs. I understand trying to re-capture energy but songs like \\"White Limo\\" don't sound like the glory days. It sounds like tired guys trying to sound like they did 10 or 15 years ago.<br /><br />On the other hand, songs like \\"Rope\\" or \\"I Should've Known\\" are really great songs that capture what I like about the Foo Fighters (Krist Novoselic is on \\"I Should've Known\\" which sounds like a song about Kurt Cobain, probably the most direct approach Dave Grohl's ever taken on a Foo Fighter's album talking about Kurt).<br /><br />When you eliminate the average and just plain bad songs off this CD, the run time comes to about 30 minutes or so. They should've just released an EP in my opinion instead of \\"wasting time\\" because they felt some obligation to make a full album.<br /><br />So to Foo Fighter fans, I recommend that you borrow this from a friend or get it at the library and burn it. Or you could buy it used for a low price for the really good songs on it, don't pay more than 5 dollars for this though.<br /><br />To Dave Grohl, release what you really feel good and passionate about and forget about the \\"big rock band, playing huge stadiums\\" mentality and remember why you started making it in the first place.

Once I get a good grasp on notes and everything.

And when it's for work, why save a few bucks on the knock-off just to have it ruin your day later?

B000IYU9HW|2.0|It is a nice story but, it should be rated R for language and sex scenes.<br />It is not a family movie.

B003UM8T3U|3.0|Like many I had heard about this film for years and finally watched it.  It is both a breath of fresh air and at the same time a completely disjointed bit of story-telling.  Goddard has introduced us to two charismatic actors who are infinitely watchable as they parade around the streets of Paris.  Jean Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg, in 1960 Europe, represent a new kind of cool pair as they casually drift around and talk in an open manner not typical of Hollywood films to that point.  Both are fashion statements for a kind of carefree, aimless lifestyle.  Despite the fact that Belmondo's character has killed a policeman he seems relatively unconcerned about it.  Some of the extended scenes, such as the opening car ride and the bedroom scene later on, are meant more for displaying style and facial close-ups than moving the narrative forward.  But I have to admit it was fun to watch these two even if the endless sexual advances and frivolous conversations got a bit tedious.  I liked the flash cuts and how the camera surveyed the city to give the backdrop of the story.  But I never felt like the story had any purpose other than to show off the stars and introduce a new way (or \\"wave\\") of doing things in cinema.  I loved the natural style of the film, and appreciate how it influenced filmmaking, but the dots never seemed to get connected by the time \\"Fin\\" rolled around.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This movie is a classic, if you have not seen this film, I recommend you pick it up today! Really an awesome film!
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I bought this for my 4-year-old grandson.  We sat and watched it together.  He loved it!  He didn't have a hard time focussing or losing his attention.  It's a sweet movie with a nice ending that kids love.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|After watching the first 20 min of The Hunger Games and I was floored. Aside from issues of race (ie the ethnicity of Katniss) and what have you, this film stands so well on its own as a sci fi film. Whether you're a fan of the books or not, it's certainly something to watch!
0307341577|5.0|So, I don't normally read this kind of book, but I must say that it was great. I mean, really great! I stopped everything just to finish it!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I'll leave the literary review to others, trust me they aren't hard to find!<br /><br />As for this ebook version, it's nice to have the whole series in one file but the conversion wasn't flawless. Bad line breaks or weird formatting crop up about every 15 pages or so. Didn't ruin the reading experience for me, but shows a lack of proofing on the editors part.

B002RKSZKI|5.0|Reading Emma was as much fun as watching the movie because it has details, events, and situations that the movie omitted.  Another reason I enjoyed reading the novel is that I could take my time and savor the story.

B0057VDGNK|5.0|This soundtrack is so unique because of the tone that it gives out the listeners when their in the car. When I drive at night to this, it puts me in such a chill mood and it really gets u loving the fact that you're driving. Best quality and sound that comes out from each song that you listen to. I'm such a huge fan of this movie. I have the jacket, gloves, movie, poster, and the soundtrack. Not only did the movie itself get to me, but it's definitely thanks to the genius soundtrack put together that delivers such a remarkable feel and experience. I strongly recommend getting this soundtrack!
B007EDYN36|5.0|I read Gene's snore-fest and I recently read Ace's bore-fest so I was hoping that Peter would deliver the real behind the scene reality of what it was like to be in one of the biggest bands in rock history.  Well he delivered the goods and more.  The sad thing was he didn't come off any better than the other members.  In fact after being a lifelong Kiss fan and after reading this I no longer can say I'm a fan of this band and the sad pathetic men behind the makeup.<br /><br />Peter really did let it all hang out at the cost of making himself look like a man who really never learned to delay instinct gratification and grow as a person.  The fact that Gene and Paul probably helped him turn to self-medicating himself because of the constant passive and not so passive aggressive behavior and the game playing he endured, but Peter still came off as pathetic and very disrespectful toward women and an adolescent attitude towards sex.  Except for Gene Chriss came off as a pig and I feel bad for his daughter.  I hope she never reads this.<br /><br />I can't believe I actually feel bad for multi-millionaires except Peter due to his poor money management, spending like the money tree would never stop growing, drug abuse the first time around and the second time around due to the greed of Gene, Paul and even Ace and of course his own poor judgment on who to trust.  I personally don't know how Gene and Paul can look at themselves in the mirror after all the people they destroyed.<br /><br />Well as a Lifelong Kiss fan Gene and Paul will never get another cent of my money (the only language they seem to understand) because I will never ever go to one of their shows or buy anything where they will profit and Ace as I suspected is a loser who was along for the ride and didn't care about his friendship with Peter or anyone else for that matter.<br />I do respect Peter for his honesty even at the cost of his own reputation.  This book was a good read even though it destroyed the wayI look at my childhood heroes.<br /><br />I apologize for writing this review before I finished the last few chapters, but I still stand by most of it except for Peter's redemption.  When he talks about his faith in God and his own insecurities I really have to admire the guy for not sugar coating his own failings something I don't believe Gene or Ace did.  I have to really respect a guy who shows all his worts and blemishes and put out the book most of us fans wanted to read even if we had to hide our eyes and read with a heavy heart.<br /><br />Thanks Peter for giving me the real life story of what it was like.

B000ICXQOM|5.0|Sam Rami and the evil dead series couldn't get any better than this massave finale. Basically \\"Evil Dead\\" 3, takes place in the past after our hero gets sucked through a time portal. There he must save the kingdom from an evil army of the dead that has risen from the grave (something he actually caused). The effects are dated but very well done and there are so many sight gags and great lines that make this a must see. As the original Duke Nukem would say \\"Hail to the king Baby\\".
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love the character or Harry Bosch.  Here is a detective with only a few yeasts left before forced retirement but he isn't sitting back on his butt just filling time till he gets the retirement party.  He is still committed to solving crimes even if they are twenty years cold.<br /><br />Harry is strong willed, opinionated, stubborn, tenacious and hard nosed, he doesn't mind making his own policies and bending the rules to catch the bad guy.  But he isn't without a softer side.  He is compassionate, sensitive, caring and willing to go out of his way to be nice, when needed.  He is the kind of cop that other cops admire and aspire to be like.<br /><br />Connolly also gives us another type of cop, Lt. O'Toole, an administrative, glory hound riding the pines but advancing up the ranks on other peoples good works.  There are good lieutenants but O'Toole isn't one of those.  He despises Bosch for his knack of bending the rules.<br /><br />Now to the story.  It's twenty years after the Rodney King riots and the police chief is pushing to reopen and solve homicides that happened during the riot that were never solve.<br /><br />Harry picks up one of how cold cases, the murder of a Danish photographer, Anneke, who maybe was in the wrong place at the wrong time or maybe wasn't.  Harry has kept her picture in his care so that he wouldn't forget her.  Now he has the chance to solve the case.<br /><br />Connelly does a great job of delivering a good story with enough plots to keep you reading.  Harry is getting close to solving the case when politics get in the way.  But Harry is committed to bringing closure to the family and for himself.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story, but mostly I enjoy Harry Bosch because he reminds me of many good detectives I know who continue to search for answers even if they have to do it on their own time.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B003ES5ZTG|5.0|If you're like me, the space behind your AV component stack is tight, and you need to do everything you can to get your cables packed into a limited amount of space. I also had a conventional HDMI cable bend (eventually break) at my TV from the occasional movement of the TV back and forth and all the pressure it puts on the connector. I thought these HDMI cables with swivel connectors would help with both issues, and to a degree, they have.<br /><br />The heads of the cable swivel freely, so you don't risk bending or breaking the cable by moving whatever it's attached to (as I did). The swivel also helps you plug it in at unusual angles, which also helps in tight spaces. Otherwise, the construction quality is good, and I've had no issues whatsoever with anything I've attached via these cables, including an HDMI 1.4 (3D) connection from my AV components to my TV.<br /><br />Only minor issue is the cable itself. Instead of the round, flexible wiring most HDMI cables rely on, these are flat and very rigid, as you can see in the picture. If you need to bend and twist the cable to snake it through your AV rack, then the rigid wiring used isn't easy.<br /><br />Otherwise, they seem high quality and a good buy for the price.
B004OBQDHK|5.0|I have always watched this movie whenever it was on tv and I figure that I might as well get the movie to have for keeps. I love this movie.
0446580848|1.0|First I am a DeMille fan, so let me get that out of the way.  I also have in the past usually really enjoyed the sarcastic and witty humor of John Corey.<br /><br />Let me put this book into one word-SUCKS<br /><br />First, Corey's humor in this book is not only pathetic but sophomoric to the nth degree.  Incredibly juvenile and absurd.<br /><br />Second, the first 90% of this book is a \\"day in the life\\" with no legitimate plot, no rhyme or reason for it even being written.  We are following the characters from one room to another or one city to another with a stream of conciousness mentality of the characters, who are not interesting and Corey is not even funny.<br /><br />Lastly, the only semi-exciting part of the book is the last 10% which is as contrived as I have ever read with absolutely implausible and nonsensical story line.  I have no problem with a book taking one down the implausible but this is absurd, predictable and terrible. This is not a short book and to have to endure through the 600 plus pages is torture.<br /><br />Pass on this, even you die hard DeMille fans like myself.  This is really terrible.
B003629IPW|4.0|I thought it was interesting and gave you a glimpse of michael Jackson the music artists. He would've put on a good show.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|It was a well made movie with an interesting slant on history.  Definitely worth watching. I liked they way they used the story line to illistrate historical events.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|it was interesting. I enjoyed playing it and it was one big puzzle. the game didn't take me that long, I found it simple yet challenging
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|You need to read this. It is very racist and sexist, but it is a classic. Considering the price for the Kindle (free), you might as well put this story under your belt.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was really impressed with how this app has turned my standard Kindle Fire into a little monster.<br />Being able to access everything from a remote location from my home based laptop has made my<br />life on the road so more portable. Awesome.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I am pretty clumsy. My kindle would probably be broken if I didn't keep it in this case. Plus it looks pretty good, too.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Very fun, like a miniature Myst. Though I beat it in two hours, I enjoyed it thoroughly. The only thing that I did not like was how short it was, but I understand that tablets and phones have limited memory.
0425263916|5.0|Could not put it down!!  Story is great!!  So much passion and excitement.  Eva and Gideon are so scarred but rise to every challenge.  Eva is strong and smart...love her!!  Hated for it to end!!  So dissappointed the next book I will have to wait for!!  I enjoyed this story more than Fifty Shades.  I found more heart pounding excitement in the storyline.  I want to know more about Cary too...
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Liked it but was a little disappointed as the book became bogged down with repetitious encounters on Harold's journey. Particularly the encounter with the large group. Apart from that, the story was well written with some interesting and unpredictable twists. Like a book where all is not what it seems. Just took a while to get there.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The newsfeed only shows about ten posts at any given time.  If you havent been on in a few days and want to catch up you will only see the most recent ten posts in your news feed and thats it.  Try the Facebook Fast app, its works much better.
B004EBT7RI|5.0|Great book particularly if you are a foodie or like Indian food. Set in Mumbai and France. Excellent characterisation. Have already purchased another book by same author set in New York.
B000002KYK|2.0|If this film's score were an island then this 'adaptation' is in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean. It so far away in terms of a faithful adaptation that it bears almost no resemblance to the film whatsoever. Who approved this? And why? Just a crummy adaptation in every regard. Don't waste your money, either go with the 94' O.S.T. release; or if you read this in a timely manner, the September 2012 release of Blade Runner: A 30th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION by Edgar Rothermich.
B008CFN95I|5.0|Really liked this because it is amusing but storyline is compelling. Would happily read another book by same author. Appeal to all ages
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Terrific book, loved &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; and could not wait to keep going with all the characters.  Ken Follet never lets me down with his writing.
B008N1V11U|1.0|this game is a memory hog. not worth deleting literally everything just to install! over all do not buy it...
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Holidays are coming and there are always those who buy a hgh demand product then sell it online for 3 times the price.  I ask you - if Minecraft is only available at Lego.com, then the toy stores and online sellers bought it online and are turning around and selling it at 3-4 times the $34.99 price.  Shame on you Lego.  You aren't making any money on this one, the people at Toy stores who bought it from you are making the profit.  I would love to get it for my grandson, Will, for Christmas, but the Amazon online price is over $117.00.  I can buy 8 Ninja Turtles for that price.  And shouldn't Lego get more product - I am sure they knew the demand would be high.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|this is built sturdy and is very thoughtfully designed. There are multiple pockets inside and outside which has enough support for all your accessories. you can also put your other cameras  or video cameras.  carrying this bag around, is very easy and it has a good shoulder support  straps.  the zippers have a tag of Amazon.  I am very impressed with this product and would highly recommend it for this price

B008W31IFS|3.0|I've loved every Harry Bosch novel I've read so far. Unfortunately, this one was a mix of Harry and his half brother, Mickey Haller. I guess Mickey Haller is Connelly's other main character of the Lincoln Lawyer fame that was made into a movie. I was intrigued because I've never read any of those books yet. I should have looked close at this one when I picked it up in the discount bin.<br /><br />I don't mind the mix of heroes, but what I didn't like was that when it was Haller's turn, the author got lazy and wrote his character in first-person. I wish I'd leafed through the book first. If I'd seen that, I never would've picked it up. I hate first-person in fiction. The author is a terrific writer, so I can give him some credit for at least making the Haller sections a bit better than average, yet I found myself having to slog through the mostly Haller courtroom scenes more than enjoying them, just so I could get to the Harry Bosch sections.<br /><br />Then there was the overall story. I found it intriguing all the way until the end. Things worked out in a way, yet I was left with so many lingering questions, I didn't get a warm fuzzy. This is the first Harry Bosch novel, or half-Harry Bosch novel I've read so far that ended that way.<br /><br />Overall, I'll call this a half-pleasurable novel as I never really warmed to the first-person sections even though there was some decent courtroom drama. It was ruined for me by the lazy first-person perspective that could've been done much better in third-person. If that's the way he does Mickey Haller, I guess I can skip his Lincoln Lawyer books. If I ever see one in the store, I'll have to leaf through it and see if this novel was just a fluke to separate the two characters.<br /><br />This story was not that great for the POV shifts and the rather vague ending. Think I'll stick with pure Harry Bosch in the future.
B005HS00V4|4.0|Big early Genesis and Peter Gabriel fan. This concert wasn't my favorite of his with the orchestra backup but I also don't dislike it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Couldn't put my kindle fire down!!! I really enjoyed the story being told through the various characters! Breath of fresh air!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best place for inspiration for any kind of craft or project!  I love it and search it at least a couple of times a week. I love having it the kindle.
0316069434|5.0|Others summarized the plot well. Although not among the best Harry Bosch books, this is a very good one and very good Bosch is deeper, more credible and simply better writen than the best of Grisham, Child, Patterson, Deaver and many others--including the author's Mickey Haller series. The ending feels a little abrupt and Bosch's boss a little too much of a shallow jerk, but this a very good read.<br /><br />Only Dennis Lehane, George Pelecanos and John Harvey have created characters as memorable as Bosch.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Harold's pilgrimage is from his home to the other end of England. The writing is such that you are journeying with him and experiencing all that he does. Harold's journey is not just physical, but emotional as well. Altogether a very worthwhile read.
B0018PH3L0|3.0|The movie was a let down after reading the book.  The book was great.  I probably would have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't read the book first.
B000244G36|4.0|Good fight scene. Do not tell me what I should write. If I like it, I like it and say so.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I cannot understand how anyone could give this a five star rating.  All the characters were poorly developed and unlikeable.  I never once felt sorry for the little girl who lost her family or the teenager accused of murdering his family.  And the supporting characters are all flawed and unlikeable.  But, this still would have been a decent read if it wasn't for the ridiculous ending.  It all turned out to be a little too convenient and silly at the same time. Not at all believable.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Beautiful movie...changed my life. Amazing! Be sure to watch in high quality on a big screen, in HD!! The scenic shots are done amazingly!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love the songs on this album..  This is my first Maroon 5 selection.  I have always liked their songs on the radio.  But, was unsure if I would like a entire album.. I am glad I decided to buy this one.

0545265355|5.0|I loved the movie and I was so intrigued that I had to fill in the blanks.  The books read so easily that you had to continue into the next one.
B00846REIS|4.0|I thought the writing was much better than &#34;Fifty&#34;. Plot different. Fun read. Will read her books again. Can't wait for the one that comes out in March.

1476712042|5.0|It's beautiful and a disaster.  There are points when you'll hardly be able to breathe because the characters are so perfect together and you'll want to cry when they are apart.  I haven't felt so much during one book in a long time!
B007ZLKKZM|5.0|This is not just a story about George, although his life is highlighted. Fantastic interview with members of the Harrison family and friends. This great documentary takes us through the great days of Beatlemania which I remember very well. I have not seen any of the segments in this documentary before. Just a great wealth of memories, inside looks, music. Made me sad and happy. There was nothing like the Beatles, there never will be. The days of real Pop and Rock Stars are gone, never to return again. This is a great film for old fans and even younger ones who want to know what it was like. I'd highly recommend this ride!
0525953728|5.0|Puts you there....hard to put down. If you read Lone Survivor and liked it, you will like this also. Highly recommended.
B00006L6YG|4.0|Thank you to the individual that had the friend who suggested it; what a unique and pleasant musical experience!  It's a great example that great music is timeless.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|I have a sansa clipzip mp3 player and a small shelf system for Ipod docking. This adapter did exactly what it says it will do. I just plugged in the audio jack to the MP3 and the larger (docking) end into the stereo system and it worked fine. The only thing I don't like is that i have to turn the volume all the way up in order to get a decent volume out of my system to listen to my songs. It does the job, just remember to turn the volume all the way up so you can hear it better.
B002M87V0A|5.0|Simple storyline, but the humor and music are really good. A lot of play with rhythm and words long before rap was a genre.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Good history - but expected a spy story.  Watched &#34;ATTONEMENT&#34; movie and not impressed.  Probably would not read any other books by this author.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book got here fast and in great shape.  This is a great vendor and I would recommend to anyone.

B0086700CM|2.0|I don't feel like it is unappropriate for young children. I would not recommend it for young children. Sorry...but the truth.
B0002MPU1K|4.0|Sometimes Mr. Cincotti's voice doesn't have enough depth or something indefinable for me. I'm no musician, but it seems to lay on top of the music rather than being a part of it. That said, I enjoy this album, and On the Moon is, for me, one of the better cuts from it.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|An exciting thriller from Ian Fleming. Forget the Bond you know from the movies, this novel will bring new depth and meaning to the classic spy.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love, love, love this movie! Its action-packed with bits of funny mixed in! If you love the avengers, I highly recommend this dvd. Can't wait for avengers 2 when its release in 2014!!
B002RXVOX0|4.0|I have always loved this movie. Mostly because Frank Langella is very sexy as Dracula. I will watch it again.
0756407125|3.0|I actually really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it more than The Name of the Wind even (where I felt like I was being beaten over the head with the assertion that it was not-your-average-fantasy-story - Alright Rothfuss I got it - you're not going to write the cliches) but it needed an editor ... an editor with a machete, and an industrial word-vacuum.<br /><br />The book is, with the exception of all the commentary on what's wrong with other fantasy stories, well written. The story is compulsive and finishing it left me at a loss, stranded in real life wondering, what am I supposed to do now? The world Rothfuss has created is rich, mysterious, exciting and real. The science/magic is cleverly and interestingly told, and I will probably start reading book 3 the day it comes out. That said ... it's kind of an achievement in itself that with all that's wrong with this book, it's still such an excellent read.<br /><br />(By the way - this is going to contain SPOILERS all the way through)<br /><br />Characterization:<br /><br />It's amazing how much I like this book, and want Kvothe to succeed ... given that I don't like *him* much at all. It's hard to like a character who is so universally excellent at everything. I can imagine Patrick Rothfuss and Terry Gooodkind getting into a bar fight over who has written the better character - 'no MINE'S the bravest and the strongest and the best at sword-fighting, magic and protecting the women-folk' etc etc. Kvothe does have faults ... but the sad part is that these seem to be mainstays of the story. By the end of book two he is as boorish, volatile, prickly and completely lacking in caution, as he has ever been.<br /><br />In stark contrast to Kvothe's complete lack of character progression, several characters in this book change in all but name. Elodin goes from being professer-ish and enigmatic in TNOTW, to being a trash-talking jack the lad in TWMF. Fela, the shy but beautiful studious type (of course - but more on that soon),is suddenly wriggling in her seat with arousal and discussing sex with all the worldliness of a high class call girl.<br /><br />The bandits, Felurian and the Adem:<br /><br />Halfway through this book, Rothfuss decides to go on vacation with the plot, while the pacing naps in his car. During the full third of the book covered by this foray into the mind-crushing boredom of Kvothe walking around in the woods, learning tritely named sex acts, sign language and martial arts, there are only 2 brief moments of interest. 1. He has a chat with the evil ctheah (think the tree from pocahontas except really mean) and it tells him a tiny bit about the chandrian. 2. At the end of the long, long, pages and pages worth of Adem martial-arting, he learns a poem about the chandrian, which basically tells him their names and their signs, half of which we know already. At this point, if Kvothe had decided to leave the Adem to study tax law I would have breathed a sigh of relief and turned the page with more enthusiasm.<br /><br />What I suspect, is that in book 1, Rothfuss set up all sorts of things that he had no clear plans about - Felurian, the trial in Imre, the Adem, rescuing some girls ...etc etc. Then in book 2 he realised he had to squeeze them in to the story somehow. So he fobs us off with a 'Kvothe can't be bothered telling the bit about the trial in Imre' and then takes him out of the real story to have these other adventures that weren't quite working with the general, Kvothe goes to university and kicks ass storyline.<br /><br />If it was shortened by half, the part with Felurian could be mostly forgiven. (Except for the part where Rothfuss has her use 'flower' to describe her vagina. Honestly, Kvothe mutilating the corpse is less cringe-worthy. Rothfuss isn't the only offender with the flower/female sexuality metaphor - I'm looking at *you* Peter V Brett - but it is just skin crawling to read. A centuries-old sex goddess and she's too coy to discuss her body. I can guarantee no real woman, no matter how shy she may be, has ever gone to a beautician and asked for her flower to be de-petaled prior to a day at the beach.)The rest needed to be consolidated into 50 pages, total, and preferably taking place on Kvothe's return journey to the university.<br /><br />Romance and Women:<br /><br />The final major flaw this book has, is the main 'love story'. Whenever Kvothe tries to describe Denna he gets frustrated and complains that he never understood her, and I imagine Rothfuss sitting at his laptop staring at the screen thinking 'how do I write women? who is Denna? how do I make them a couple people care about?'  Keep looking for those answers Rothfuss.<br /><br />There is no emotional chemistry between Kvothe and Denna ... in fact there is no emotional chemistry between any romantic couple in this book. Fela and Simmon make no sense together, the Maer and Meluan are about as compatible as bullets and ice cream. Kvothe's parents had a connection, but even Kvothe's mother fits into the basic Rothfuss female archtype - lusty, beautiful and clever (because if they weren't clever it would be a cliche!)<br /><br />And yet, in spite of all the academic know-how and musical/fighting talent Rothfuss ascribes to his female characters he then goes on to write, 'Women don't like Denna because she's beautiful.' Thanks for that ... because women are actually simplistic creatures with the emotional maturity of dogs on heat - 'any female who distracts the males is my enemy!' It's not that Denna isn't dislikeable - she's an arrogant, self-absorbed, cocktease (sorry river-growing-reed-tease) - but this comment confirms the general impression Rothfuss gives, of wanting to respect women, but not having the slightest idea about them - or relationships with them.<br /><br />I like these books, I like Rothfuss even ... but he writes like a student of writing, not a master of it.
B0095T3H2U|1.0|I hate to say that this is a crappy movie since it is taste thing but I was surprised how poorly it was made...crappy screen play, horrible acting...bad direction...list goes on.  It looked like an very bad indie movie with good funding.
0765356139|1.0|Do I have to give this book a star? It doesn't deserve one.<br /><br />Don't worry about spoilers, nothing happens in this book - there's nothing to spoil.<br /><br />Final Empire was so great. I read it through the night and then suffered the consequences of work on no sleep the next day. It was worth it - thoroughly enjoyable (though I think if Kelsier had winked one more time he would have developed some kind of eyelid spasm, it was his only conversational response for the latter half of the novel) Excessive winking aside, excellent book - then I wasted my money, time, and sanity on Well of Ascencion.<br /><br />These books are the literary equivalent of letting a random buy you a drink at a bar. The first bit's great - you enjoy the drink and some small talk, but then they start whining and following you around, and you don't feel like you can get rid of them because you did enjoy that first drink.<br /><br />If you like whining, then Well of Ascension is the book for you. Vin whines about whether she is good enough for whatever-his-face-I-stopped-caring, and would clearly rather be bonking his maniac half-brother in the mist.  Whatever-his-face whines about whether Vin really likes him anymore, and both of them agonise over this, and their worth as people, for the first 85% of the book. (This was the point at which I deleted it from my ipad out of sheer boredom.)<br /><br />Who knows, maybe in that latter 15% a story arrived to the party, late, with a few beers and oh, you know, some suspense, action, maybe a joke or two ...pretty much anything other than teenagers wondering whether they like each other but like ... are they worth liking? Because if they don't like each other maybe they're not worth liking ... UGH.<br /><br />Seriously, bottom 5 books I've ever read, and I read Twilight. Don't bother.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|Although the physical dimensions of this set are impressive, its musical proportions are epic; one might say, Wagnerian.  The recordings themselves are exquisite: the Solti series is perhaps the best there is, but this edition does them full justice.  The additional items are also judiciously chosen; Deryke Cooke's Introduction to Der Ring des Nibelungen is one of the best summaries and presentation of Wagnerian motifs available.  The DVD The Golden Ring and the book Ring Resounding are both good presentations of the recording project.  For those with a Blu-Ray player, the Blu-Ray copy is a nice bonus as well.  It's something of an irony that the 14or so CDs of the operas can all fit onto one Blu-Ray, but such are modern conveniences.<br />In summary, if you want the best, this is it.
B004XQO90E|4.0|this movie shows how cracked up the governement could be once u sign on.  They can sign u up for just about anything, your government  property
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I bought this book, it was hard to put it down. I had to know what was going to happen next. As an avid reader, I often get very caught up in the story and consider the characters close friends. This book being no different. There were many similarities between the main character and I that help build the bond. Anyone can relate to the simple idea of man versus high school. It brings back the memories of peer pressure, tests of faith, and what you believed in. Although there is a morbid under current that doesn't emerge till the end, it is a true tear jerker and thought inducer. This, above all, is a unique and wonderful book in and of itself.
