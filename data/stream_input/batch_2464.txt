B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. Was into temple run but after playing subway surfer I haven't gone back to temple run at all. I have this on all 3 of my devices. Awesome game. My grandson has it on his kindle fire and he is really good. He is only 4 and he plays this game way better than I do.

B0015DROBO|5.0|This is one of the best series I've ever read.  I'm left to wonder what would have followed if Larsson still lived....drama w/a long lost sister???<br /><br />This was my 3rd read and I've seen the movie several times.

B00CATSONE|5.0|Far more than a standard biography, Sean Patrick uses the life story of the work of Nikola Tesla as a backdrop to explore the larger topics of innovation and success. The author makes astute observations and connections about what commonalities great men and geniuses share that inspired them to persevere while others faltered and failed.<br /><br />If you like to think and love to learn, download this book!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00CATSONE Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man That Invented the 20th Century]]
193700788X|2.0|From other reviews I thought there was some change-up with Eric and he was being sold into slavery or something. He just gets roped into a 200 year \\"marriage\\" instead of a \\"standard\\" 100 year contract. Big deal. Don't know why readers are so upset about that. He was never going to have a happily ever after with Sookie, he is too self-absorbed. Ms Harris has been \\"phoning in\\" the last two books prior to this final one, so it is really no shock this is such a pathetic ending to a once loved series. She has lacked cohesiveness and storyline follow-through in these last 3 books which sometimes makes you wonder if she even remembers her writings. All of a sudden she can't hear Sam's thoughts, just his emotions. Characters get \\"name dropped\\" just to have endings assigned to them. WHY was Barry even in this book? He served very little purpose. Tara's part in this book could also have gone without - it added nothing but unecessary drivel. Ms Harris could have fact-checked through her fansite. WHY did Sookie worry so much her bond with Eric was blood-based and not care that her bond with Sam could have been the after-effect of the cluviel door? She wanted a \\"normal life\\" yet she is still \\"off into the sundet\\" with a supernatural. The whole friendship with Bill after the rape really bothered me. I was raped when I was in college. I still see the man on rare occassions because he works on pubic transportation I take from time to time and sometimes he is on the trainline I switch to. We ARE not friends, I DO NOT speak to him despite the fact he acts like we are old friends. I would NEVER confide ANYTHING to him or even speak to him for ANY reason. That was 20+ years ago and I am not willing to \\"let bygones be bygones\\". Yes, it is \\"her book\\" as several readers point out. She has said she wanted to write the best books she could and she has failed miserably in the last 3 of this series. If you are \\"writing for yourself\\" as she has implied, then you DO NOT put your books out for publication. Putting a book out for publication is not \\"writing for yourself\\", it is writing for $s, writign for attention and recognition. It is NOT a private thing. Once you have your works published they are almost like community property. Your fans have a vested interest in what you write and in some VERY small way, you have a duty to your fanbase. How many years have we spent reading the 13 books - since 2001??? Maybe you should not have contracted to write so many books in the series and then you could have stopped when you got bored instead of writing just to fill up volumes you were committed to write. I read the final book knowing it was probably going to be as half-heartedly written as the last 2 but secretly hoping she would put some effort into this final installment. Wrong - slop a story together and then hide and do no press or book signings because you know your fans will be disappointed and you have no courage to face them. You only want their $s. The Sookie books were never great writing, but they were amusing. This book was not horrible, it was not good either. Would I have felt like I had missed something in the storyline if I had never read it - not at all. Although I do like watching Trueblood I have been very dispppointed she sold it off and has allowed it to go so very far away from the storylines of the books. They oniy resemble each other in character names only. I will not innvest any of my time in any of Ms Harris' other works again.
B007ZZKXWS|1.0|The previews on youtube were so awesome.<br /><br />What happened?  The only thing the movie had in common with the youtube promos were both had Nazi's.<br /><br />My advice....grab the promos off of youtube and wait for a remake.

0740797719|5.0|it explains a lot of thing that help to give a realist look on your paintings (the writer of the book is a traditional artist but the lesions can be really helpful to digital artists too!)<br /><br />The book has a lot of images that help you understand what the author is explaining (and it's easy to understand).<br />I think it's better than his other book &#34;imaginative realism&#34;.
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|I'm using this on either a canon 5dmk2 or 7d. It's an improvement over the in-camera mic for sure when audio levels are set manually.  And I like the small form factor as compared to the original rode video mic. It captures good quality audio within about 15ft.  Any further than that and the quality suffers.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is a great app for timing your meditations.  I use it every day.  It has gentle ringing bells to start and end.  It also has a social aspect where you can connect with other meditators or view a few words about their practice or their websites.  A very useful practical app.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I would have enjoyed this movie more had Dan Afleck's character had a 3 dimensional personality but it was more of a factual documentary than entertainment. I would have liked to know where the people he rescued are today.

0765365278|5.0|Many other reviewers have left very good and detailed glimpses at why this book by Sanderson is so exceptional.  For that reason, I will refrain from writing another 3000 word review.  So, if you want details about the book, its characters, and plot, please look elsewhere.  I just felt that Sanderson deserves one more great review.  So here is a brief overview of why this book is a fantastic addition to the fantasy genre.<br /><br />The Way of Kings is really, really good.  Brandon Sanderson has created a genuine work of art.  It is clear that he poured much love into this project.  His world-building and imagination is phenomenal.  As other reviewers have mentioned, some people complain that this book is LONG.  Well it is, but in a good way.  Unlike many other stories you do not instantly fall in love with Sanderson's characters.  In fact, I found them to be somewhat boring at first.  However as I continued the story I found myself appreciating this a little more.  The characters Sanderson introduces become very real, and the world they find themselves in is completely believable.  It is full of mystery that unlocks a little more as you go along, almost as if I were building a close relationship with a long-time acquaintance that I just never took the time to get to know.  The story continues to charm, shock, and intrigue.  A little patience really pays off here.  I found myself empathizing more and more with the characters as the story unfolds.  To me, it added to the believability of Sanderson's world and to the retainment value of his projected series.  I will eagerly await the second book of this series.<br /><br />I like the time that Sanderson put into developing this story and I enjoyed the \\"slowness\\" of the world and character building.  It makes the reader care more about this world.  A Way of Kings is slow and methodical without being boring (especially the first 500 pages).  In the first half of the book nothing that extraordinary really happens, but I didn't care at all.  That speaks volumes of the author's quality.  Still, the book is set with moments of combat, betrayal, mystery, philosophy, religion, and political intrigue.  The setting of Roshar feels eerily \\"real\\" and believable while simultaneously remaining refreshingly fantastical.  I like it, and I was encouraged that many other readers do too!  This is a story that the reader can get lost in for its highly imaginative and well-thought-out nature.<br /><br />A Way of Kings is a masterful debut title of the projected 10-book \\"Stormlight Archive.\\"  I'm looking very forward to the second.  IMHO, If Sanderson retains his quality of authorship throughout this series, I would dare say that this could turn out to be one of the finest examples of fantasy literature ever written.<br /><br />A+
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I like Johnny Depp and he does a good job with this one but  I think that the previews were funnier than the movie. THere were opportunities for laughs that never came off.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This album is great. It is a rare example of an album that can be listened to end to end. The songs have their ups and downs of course but the whole is fantastic. Plus it helps that I am a Washingtonian. It's great to see a big hitter represent the northwest. On a final note,  you can tell these guys are having fun. The heavier songs do not define the artistry here, there is gratitude and levity to the lyrics.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|I enjoyed &#34;The Last stand&#34;. It had some decent action and humor. It wasn't as bloody as some action flicks but still a decent story and entertaining to watch.
B0066WJLU6|2.0|Only as bright as screen light. I thought it would be like real flashlight.It is OK I still kept it.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I can't believe I sat through the entire movie. I should have listened to my wife when she asked to turn it off half way through. This movie was torture from start to end.
0375703764|4.0|That is the way it will leave your head. This book is a little outside of the box, but will hold your attention all the way. It draws you in until you feel the effect of the story so much so you tend to think you are there. This author is more than a writer, he is an artist.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I got my new tablet, no amazon apps, went to google play , my apps and it wouldn't let down load it!<br />Tried to down load it from amazon,  they recommended I  get the tablet version! All is well with the world now!
B008K8VDPU|1.0|It is so bad that I had say that it was so bad to my brother and it would not let me play on it at all and I hats it so bad.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Once I began reading it I could not put it down! Now that I have finished the story I can't help but wonder about how each character spent the rest of their lives as if they are real people
B005HSL626|4.0|I really like it, I just wish that there were no bombs, that there were more fruit and that there was a never ending level..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game and very addicting. My five year old will play it for hours and seems to do better then me.
0385349947|5.0|I chose this book because I wanted to take a look at myself (as a working woman) through someone else's eyes to try and understand and change the things that may be holding me back in the workplace.  There were some things mentioned in the book that are quite obvious but others that had never really crossed my mind.  This book has given me the courage to step out from behind my fears and doubts and move forward.
B009AVC922|5.0|One of the best anime I have ever watched. Really good storyline great swordplay action.<br />And of course anime style twist of monster fantasy infused into the samurai/ninja world.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Almost perfect version of scribblenauts! If scribblenauts on PC or DS is too much money, then get this app! (Extra Words)
B009NY43NY|5.0|I honestly don't understand some of the negative reviews I've read. The book was another Sookie novel, tried and true. Harries followed her same format (which I always feel to be a bit rushed, but not enough to give any of the books only 1 star!) and the book unfolded just like all the other Sookie books have in the past... someone tries to kill Sookie, something mysterious happens in which Sookie has to solve the mystery, a little love lost and a little love gained.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and thought that is tied everything up in a nice little package. It ended how I believed it would and in the manner in which I think Sookie will be the happiest. I've enjoyed this series a lot and hope that everyone will cut it a little more slack!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I like the graphics but some in game buttons do not work with the first touch. Overall it is a good game.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I watched this movie with my wife and we both enjoyed it very much. ;) we both cried at the end.....just being honest.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Another great game of Angry Birds. Rovio has done it again. I play on my Kindle Fire and on Facebook. Love it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so sweet!!! I seriously love arcade mode!!! My high score is over 840. On my tablet (my other tablet) there was this glitch that gave me more time every time I hit a bomb.
B004H4XAXO|5.0|I found the opening of the book a little hard to warm to with lots and lots of stuff being introduced, without a key narrative to anchor you.  I felt like I entered the world confused, lost and cold to its characters  but afte persisting through to the half way point  Everything started to click  and By the end I was hooked and promptly re-read the entire book....  the  Main Characters  are so rich and real;  the world is  bizarre but enchanting.  I look Forward to the rest of the Series,  It shows a stack of Promise and  with how well the mistborn series ends,  I can trust Sanderson  over the long hall !!  ( reading a 10 book series is a big commitment!!)
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Near the end of the zip line the freaking coins kept on going straight through me!!!! Please fix this and I am going to say 5 stars, OK. I would recommend it for a Samsung Galaxy S 3.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|I think Brandon Sanderson is a great author and his treatment of the Wheel of time series has been Great.  It does feel a little rushed though....  I feel like books 5-10  were slow and contained way too much aes sedai  politics so to actually get to  ending so much of the detail had to be shed and ignored.  but the core story is really solid and satisfying
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You know, I love temple run, but when it comes to graphics, I point them out. This app did not really have any issues, just something I noticed. You only have  one background.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|the movie is excellent. the blueray disc comes with several additional options that give better quality product. I highly recommend it and the price is very good
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|The book is organized like a set of short essays on many various topics of starting a company.  It is geared to software companies that do most of their business interaction online, so if you are a brick and mortar company, you won't be able to apply as much as a software/online service startup.  It gave me some great insight and actually reinforced several things I already assumed, but didn't have any third party validation of, like business plans and 5 year plans are stupid, since in today's online economy, 5 years is a lifetime for most companies.  A great book, and I highly recommend it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is an extremely fun game. Packed with intrigue and excitement and new twists in every room!!! I recommend it to all!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great retelling of the early years of Star Trek and fun for the whole family. Every reappearance of the old characters were greeted with yelps and hollers. Watched it a second time a couple months later and had just as much fun the second time around. Can't wait for the new movie; I wish they'd turn this into a television series. 4 years is a long wait between films!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love being able to access the weather by going on my tablet, rather than just on my computer.  Very easy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am so hooked on this game. I love it. the only thing is I wish you didn't have to buy gems or more coins to get the stuff you want!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Has cool clocks and displays. Not only that but it lets you wake up to your own music. Trust me it is a great app
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book has the spider's web beginning to close up around characters that are just coming to a place of settlement or so we the reader are lead to believe.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is fun to play especially when you want to just kill time.  I guess it keeps your brain working finding the correct matches.  I like the fact that it was free.  Anyone who enjoys Mahjong should like this game.
0307200477|2.0|To be fair, my son loves this book.  He wants to read it over and over.  But this &#34;Deluxe Edition&#34; is horrible.  It is a hardcover with plastic spiral rings inside.  It fell apart on day 1.  I tried to put it back together but it immediately fell apart as soon as my son tried to look through the pages.  The back cover says &#34;this is a keepsake that will last for generations to come.&#34;  Hardly.
0307279189|5.0|I'm a lifetime runner, age 58, and tried running barefoot on and off way back in high school. This book revived my desire to give it another try. Thanks!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this GAME it is so fun and super awesome. I can not wait to see what the next town is, why not let it be Connecticut! That is where I live!!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|There are left no more versions of this kind of film for Tom. It is worth the rent - typical Tom, and most of us like these films. Don't you get irritated at these reviewers who cut and paste words, phrases, and even paragraphs from reputable reviewers? I bet, though, most of them who do so are high school students searching for a career. I remind you that stealing another's words is not a resume builder.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I find this very helpful no matter where I am. I think it's pretty accurate as well. I recommend it.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|To be able to watch this series of Merlin without any ads interupting viewing gave the whole new depth of enjoyment to the experience.<br /><br />the actors have grown into their roles over the series and this was powerfully shown over the final 2 episode.<br />A series to keep and enjoy many times for the fine acting.<br />Anyone who enjoyed the series on Free to Air TV will love it more owning this series on DVD
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|I love all the songs except for the rap songs on the album. The first song, No Freedom is amazing.
0007331789|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  Cornwell is a master at historical fiction.  I am so glad it's not the last book and am eagerly awaiting the next installment.
B001200MXW|4.0|This is probably one of if not my favorite Doors album.  They hit it just right with the songs Indian Summer and Ship of Fools.  There is simply alot of Mood in each and every song and yet the Mood is the same but different.  The music takes me to many different places and thoughts.  I like it alot.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game is great for parties, but I bring it to school and students come to play it after school and love it.  I like asking questions about their strategy and making them define certain words or concepts in their strategies, and having them rate pieces by different (secretly mathematical) criteria.  If you're a math teacher, especially a geometry teacher, you'd probably like this.
B00122878M|4.0|There is nothing as good as a Live show that hits the mark.  The doors simply feed off each other and manage to hit the breaks when Jim goes on his trips in the middle or end of songs.  This is one of their best albums, if you lay back close your eyes and turn it up you can feel the vibs as if you were seeing them in a smoke filled room taking you on a LIVE ride.  It made me want to BREAK on through to the other side. I like a alot.  If your not sure I suggest checking out if there is a song or two on you tube from the concert, then I know you will see what I am saying is real.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|cant even get to the<br />game to see if I like it. another one in the garbage.<br />needs to be fixed 's I am sure it would be great for my kids
B000TEPIQS|5.0|What a voice, man can she sing.  Sia puts feeling into every song and the way she can move her voice around is fantastic.  I am a hard rocker at heart, but Sia has stolen mine.  I love just about everything she sings, even a lot when she was with Zero 7.  I really wish I could hear her Live.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He normally wants only the Lego Kingdom sets; Lord of the Rings is the only acceptable alternative.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wish the series/story didn't have to end! I'll be curious to see how closely they follow the story line for the movie....
1423117166|5.0|I got this as a Christmas gift for my sisters, who are all artists and love the Disney style of animation. They were very appreciative.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Hard to find a really good movie these days. This movie was refreshing.<br />Sad, funny and sweet all wrapped up together
B009R659L8|5.0|Keeps you wondering until the very end. Very typical of Mary Higgins Clark mysteries.  Hope Mrs. Clark keeps writing these excellent mysteries.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I honestly say i love or like all of her albums.  i like this one more than the last two.  she sounds like the real bonnie i've been listening to all my adult life.  listen to her first 5 or 6 first albums, before she broke through to the grammy scene.<br />they are just as good as any of the later ones.  maybe you had to be there, but i don't think so.  love you bonnie. i've  seen you in concert more times than i can count!!!!!!!
B00447L4KA|5.0|I just love this movie and this one was perfect. I bought it another time used and it skipped a lot so I got this one.
B00B2TTVNU|4.0|The recording is excellent. I havn't played the 3rd concerto yet, but all the other pieces I played are very good. Richter might be a little better on the 2nd, but still her performance and prodigious technique is amazing!! Highly recommended. I should also say that the price of this 2 cd set is very reasonable. Very good value.
B002M87W9K|5.0|I bought this so that my daughter could see it to help her decide if she wanted to do the play when her children's theater company puts it on this fall.  She quickly fell in love with it & not only wants to do the play but said it's become one of her favorites.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Good, but not great, movie.  Hope you like car chase scenes.  Liam Neeson is always wonderful to watch.  Pretty good script.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book took a little while to get into but once I had the time to just sit & enjoy reading something this was great.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book!!! I couldn't put it down!!! The story was very well written, and related to real life college romance
B005HSL626|5.0|I downloaded Fruit Ninja Free, and can't stop playing it.  Whenever I have free time, I always play Fruit Ninja.  It's so addictive!
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This product was downloaded as expected and I had no problems reviewing it and performing as it should for my pc/kindle.
B001N9ESQ4|1.0|I watched Before Sunrise as a teenager when it was first released in theaters and thought it very romantic.  Watched it again recently (as a mid-30something) and while it didn't have the same feel as an adult, it was still charming and I found myself wanting to know \\"what happens next\\".  I should have left it alone.  I will give it credit for being like the first movie in that they get the story going right away without a lot of fuss or non-important scenes, and like the first, it's all pretty much dialogue.  That's where the similarity ends.  The dialogue in Sunrise is charming, youthful and interesting, and the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy grows and is believable.  The dialogue in Sunset is primarily spoken by Delpy, who spends the first half of the movie taking every possible opportunity to bash America.  When not bashing America, it's a bunch of ranting by her about how bad the world is, etc. etc.  Wouldn't mind had this been one part of a conversation, but it's almost HALF of it.  The rest of the dialogue is the two of them feeling the need to crudely discuss sex (again, a little goes a long way, and gets tiresome after a fashion), and again Delpy's rants, but this time about her failures in her personal life.  In between, are more tired lines that contradict her previous socio-political-environmental rants.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two is completely absent, and halfway through the movie (when Delpy switches from political rants to love-life rants) they drop it on you that Hawke is married and has a child.  From that point on, my interest in \\"what happens between them\\" went to pretty much zero, although I hung on anyway since I already paid the rental fee.  As predicted at this point, Hawke confesses to be in a loveless marriage, only married because his wife got pregnant, etc. etc. etc.  Of course, with how \\"familiar\\" he's been talking to Delpy, you would never know he was married, which makes me like his character less and less.  Add that tothe zero chemistry and it becomes really hard to believe that leaving his wife to pursue Delpy would be the best decision for him.  At one point he's talking about how he can't imagine being away from his son, but then there he is, very obviously ready to throw away his marriage for a woman who lives on the other side of the world and who has her own career and independent life...Like we're supposed to believe she'd give all that up and move to the evil USA so that Hawke could be with his kid post-divorce...But that's the reality YOU the viewer are forced to contemplate when the sex-starved characters won't do it themselves.  If they really wanted to go down that route in the story, they needed to spend LESS time ranting about environmental/political issues and MORE time rekindling the chemistry and discussing the practicality of getting back together.  Then they could have left us hanging.  Which they do anyway.  Except at that point, you are ready to throw tomatoes at your TV.  Skip this one and keep the good memories of Sunrise intact.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|I love Harry Bosch.  I love the Lincoln Lawyer.  These stories did not compare, at all.  I like the way Connelly writes but these stories didn't reflect his quality.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Hubby loves these! Great for me too - keeps the sound out so I don't have to hear it, and he loves that it completely covers his ears.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|But I like the story development of the novels too.  These small slices cases just didn't do it for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am so excited to keep reading, but will be so sad one the series is over. This book mixes suspense, action, and romance in the most perfect way. Not only is this book very good, but it is very well written. It goes into very good detail but not enough so you will get bored. I could not put it down and it always left me wondering what was going to happen next. This is the most amazing book I have ever read and I would recommend this book to everyone. If you liked the movie you will love the book. It is at least 20 times better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the game is great and has great grafics and awesome and and cool but it is hard to get money.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|The combination between traditional Unitedstatesian music and African is delightful and inspiring.  The CD got to me on time and I am very grateful.  Thanks!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game! If you have been looking for a Myst-like game.. look no further. Well worth the $2! Graphics were well done, puzzle are not extremely difficult, just enough to make you think. I will be buying more games from this company in the future!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Has a good story line. Characters play well though I wish it kept a better pace thru the middle. Could have given some hint of the surprise at the end.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Well, this isn't Bejeweled, but it's a close clone to it compared to so many other games of the genre. And, you can tell it tries to be like Bejeweled since one of its modes is an exact rip from that same game (Mineral). However, being a free game, it does have that independent, non-retail feel to it. The Arcade mode to it has levels upon levels upon more levels of increasing challenge (some of them easier than previous levels). The only other mode than Mineral and Arcade is Classic, dealing with increasing a progress bar to get to the next level, doing everything in a generic manner. No fancy sound effects, no spectacular special effects, etc. It keeps itself quite simple in its execution and premise. At times, it could've done more to show it could be its own star rather than try to be an indie version of Bejeweled. As it is, it's a decent, cozy way of passing time (if you have the battery power).

B009AMALLM|3.0|You remember that debut trailer for this flick, when it showed as a webcam conversation that started to get glitch then a whirlwind of cryptic things started happening, causing mass confusion? Unfortunately that, my main point of hoping for something to happen, never happened. Neither did a couple other things from a couple other trailers, not even in the unrated edition, making me wonder why they bothered adding 9 minutes of footage if they decided to not throw everything in?<br />And I do mean they seemed like they didn't throw everything in since this PA, unlike the past installments, definitely had events more spread out and some the creepier moments, though jump-worthy, simply didn't come up to par.<br />This is more of a continuation (of sorts) to the first (finally, an actual sequel- not a film with a progressive number and ending up going farther back), and a lot of things are more hinted at than anything else. At times, this ends up ruining some of the suspense. Really, the only advanced tricks done to this installment was adding Xbox Kinect to the mix for tech value (that and Rob Zombie, apparently, make for a great dance party). And it seems the Kinect gets about equal screentime as the laptop camera (courtesy of the heroine's boyfriend). And yet, maybe it was just the TV I have, but the familiar \\"rumble\\" sound that precedes the creepy stuff that happens seemed absent. Even in the last half hour, where the crazy stuff should've really picked up and go over-the-top, it really doesn't, it seems like they simply went for \\"just enough\\" to make sure it appeased certain audiences, not all who enjoy efficient jumps, rather than wasted jump moments.<br />Luckily, it did have a couple classy visual references to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (which got me grinning), and yet, in the final shot, it still didn't go over-the-top, but just went the path of the ridiculous then ended on what I felt to be a second-rate ending. Too many questions unanswered, not enough frights, not enough mainstay trademarks. For this, I was quite frustratingly disappointed. Sadly, I don't think there'll be a 5th, but if there will be, they better improve on it.ghts, not enough mainstay trademarks. For this, I was quite frustratingly disappointed.

B00COHAUD4|5.0|Honestly as bad as most horror genre movies are these days I didn't think I would like this movie as much as I did. The story was great and you really didn't know what to expect. This is a movie you can actually get into with a real, emotional story.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|The game is okay, I really can't complain as its free! just like the seasons game better than this one
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book has unusual twists. Don't want to say too much or it will spoil the book others who want to read it
B000FA675C|5.0|I loved everything about this book! I especially enjoyed when the main characters would get into situations impossible to get out of...and yet they always did in a believable way. The descriptions of famous, mystical sites, were very well written, and the questions posed were mind boggling at times. I will be pondering those questions for a very long time.
B00BXRFCFM|5.0|If you even ended up on this page just buy the CD, its good and any metal fan should appreciate a different direction for metal music.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest movies ever! It's definitely one of my all time favs. And my 5 year old's! Steve Carell is absolute gold in this and those kids are fabulous (&#34;he's so fluffy!&#34;). CAN'T WAIT for the sequel this summer!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I love the beat!!  Daft Punk is super good.  I can't wait for their album.  I would recommend this to my friends.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I was waiting for this one to come out on dvd and I was not disappointed. My daughter and I are HUGE fans of the Ice Age movies and we just loved this one (although she was a bit scared of the ape at first). I hope they make another one!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|After listne to this album i decided to buy all of his music.  He is music talks about his life and speaks about current issues with our country.  I love the beat.  It makes you think.  Very poetic too!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|If you're a fan of the Tinkerbell movies, this one is a must-see! My daughter and I just LOVE this one. I'm 43 and not ashamed to admit I love this series of movies. Very well done and the music is amazing. Worth every penny.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Starts off slow but really picks up in the middle!! Can't wait for the next one of the series. Yea
B003UESJF6|5.0|I normally do not like Will Ferrel movies, HOWEVER, he's phenomenal in Megamind! This movie is fantastic. Brad Pitt's pretty funny, as is Tina Fey, but Will Ferrel is the heart and soul of this movie and does an incredible job as the mastermind of evil! lol! He's hysterical, and like I said, I normally do not like any movie he's in (just a personal preference) but he's gold in this one!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I just loved it, a classic Quentin Tarantino movie. If you are a fan of his, then this is one that you MUST see!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This was a great quick read that would bring a smile to almost anyone's face.  I have a new kind of respect for Tina Fey and her accomplishments!
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that I love &#34;Chuck,&#34; so I might be a little biased. Anyways, I would totally recommend ANY season of Chuck who wants to be entertained by laughing through an action packed sitcom, all the while having plenty of drama!
B00005JN8Z|5.0|This is a fascinating movie that, like many epics, ends up being much more than the sum of its parts, and this is an elegant reissue. Ironically, this past Easter, I watched it on two old video-tapes from the 1980's, and I still found it moving, despite being blurry and hardly visible. It's interesting too, that the filming of Quo Vadis also provided jobs for thousands in post-war blighted Italy. Still a record holder for most costumes, the crowd scenes are the real thing, 30.000 in the Triumph scene and a similar number in the Arena. Despite the grand acting, when the Christians start singing as the Lions are set upon them, there is a sense of presence. This was the film that paved the way for the BBE's (Blockbuster Biblical Epics) of the 1950. Without Quo Vadis, Ben Hur would be just another chariot driver.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|good movie. I liked the setting, story and the cinematography. The CGI effects were pretty amazing. This is a Must SEE movie.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|The movie is still current in my thoughts. Reading the book revealed the brilliance of Puzo. It was and is an open window into life as an immigrant in the earlier part of the early nineteenth century.
0071762345|5.0|Much has been said about being likable, interesting and engaging on social media. But HOW do you do that?<br /><br />Dave really shows you how. He includes examples of companies that are TRULY being social, and breaks down why certain things work.<br /><br />I read this book when I first started doing social media for a company, and I am so glad I did. I use concepts from this book every day. I had researched a LOT before finding this book, but I can honestly say that this book was the most helpful in actually getting me in the mindset I needed to be in to do great things socially.<br /><br />If you want to do social media, but aren't sure if you \\"get it\\", this is the book for you. Trust me, you will make better decisions, and experience more success, just by being \\"Likable\\".

B00AB7HESI|5.0|I've been playing scribble nauts on my dsi when I saw it on this for only .99 cents I went crazy. When I got it it was so fun I thought it's controls were also the controls for minecraft. Y'all better buy it cause I think It should be 6.99$ instead!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Watched after hearing about it from the Oscar's. Movie was interesting, a bit slow at the beginning but the story line was great!
B006M4F67A|5.0|It is purely subjective of course, but I find that it has a high level of polish I have not seen in other \\"Mahjong Solitare\\" games on Android. On a 10 inch tablet it is an absolute joy to play. I use those quotes because the game of \\"Mahjong\\" is actually more like the game of dominoes than solitaire.  However mahjong tiles are the same in both games.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This used to be my favorite game, not anymore.  The game freezes  all the time and the rooms are next to impossible to complete even if you Don't get cheated out of the few credits they give each day.  The chat is nothing more than a beg-fest from others<br /> wanting you to donate to them.  If you accept these people as friends, chances are you'll probably get scammed or have a pervert as your new best friend. Stay away,it's not worth it!!
0062238868|5.0|Saw lots of young marines reading it on the planes I took the last few months. Got it for my husband and I hope he finds it great
B00AJAFNIA|3.0|It's entertainment for five minute but I got. bored really quickly!! I think it would take no more then a few second  to get bored and not wan  it anymore
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game was so much fun to play with my kids or on my own! Good for kids to learn problem solving with some of their favorite characters!
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I thought it deserved its academiy award.  Kudos to the director.  Also to the young lead actor.  He was great.
B001CTDH4Y|1.0|only watched it because I love chihuahuas.  I think kids would enjoy it.  I donated my copy to my library.  Wish I had not purchased it.
B000SEI230|4.0|Amazing love story, but be prepared to cry at the end. It also is completely different from the movie. I honestly think I like the movie a little better. However, I suggest reading the book as well.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My sister loves this game. She plays it all of the time. It's really great for her to have because she loves horses.<br /><br />..
B00005AWMF|5.0|Had to re-purchase this cd my first one broke. I was so happy when it came . I love every song ! I plan to get other CDs from this artist.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like the this game.  Its fun and it reminds me of the days in grade school when everyone fought and competed over this game when it was cool.  I like adventure/time management type of games and so this is a great game.  Except sometimes they want you to pay for items and I'm cheap so I don't do it.  That kinda limits what you can achieve in the game which is disappointing.  But if you don't mind that, then this is the game for you.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Much more fun and fast than the one for the keyboard kindle.  Yeah<br />I think this could be addictive. Might play it all day.
B002ZG97LK|4.0|Different that the original but very good.  The story line and acting was done very well.  Enjoyed and would recommend to all adult age groups.
B004SIP9VA|4.0|all through watching the movie I thought he was going to cheat on his wife but when she found out what he was doing and then she and their daughter went to the competition and the daughter yelled out and ruined the whole competition I was disappointed. I was hoping that would be the happy ending by winning the competition.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game ever I cant wait til buckets then it would MINECRAFT POCKET EDITION rocks MCPE
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|Loved watching Richard Gere and Jodi Foster together. I was confused through most of the movie but I was trying to watch it while in and out of the room. Must see love story.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game. I grew up with my little ponies, and now that I have girls of my own, I enjoy the new generation of my little ponies.

B00005RIKI|5.0|I really love this cd it is true to Lynyrd Skynyrd in the beginning.  All the songs are well written and the music and backgrounds are great.
0307346617|5.0|This book is a series of interviews that paints a picture of the world going through a zombie apocalypse. Overall, its a great read.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|This CD is true to the Lynyrd Skynyrd style.  All of the songs are done extremely well and the music and beat is great.  I don't anything about special sounds from the guitars and drums but I can say to me they are very well done.  I would highly recommend this cd to anyone that is looking for a good sound and meaningful, true Lyndrd Skynrd work.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was cool having a dictionary on my kindle but it was boring and too long. I'll just say that it is ok.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app is a NEED TO GET but it should go more into how good you battery is. all it says on mine is good.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Great book.  Great continuation of maze runner.  Kept me interested and anxious the whole time.  Really connected with Thomas and what he was going through.
B00CM96A60|5.0|Hearing Armin's new sounds are such a pleasure! Some great new tracks, but love the Pure Trance toward the end of the album.<br /><br />Now, Armin isn't just a DJ, he's a world class business man and his production shows that off here. Go to a Armin show, and you will enjoy this production even more!<br /><br />D
B000JML90Y|5.0|Very straight forward and practical explanation of things that we, in the modern world, tend to over-complicate and politicize, sometimes to the detriment of Mr Darwin's great work and reputation.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Nikola Tesla was a man way ahead of his time.  One of hte great minds of the period, he likely woudl have provided mankind with considerably more technological advances than the actually did ,had he had a good business and financial manager. Like most geniuses, he saw the world through a completelt different pair of glasses and imagined things most men couldn't even conceive of. I you don't know about this great man and his contributions to mankind, this book should be on your reading list.
0486446859|4.0|This comprehensive collection of Arthur Rackham's memorable illustrations that so caught my imagination as a child is excellent. His detail is remakable and the reproductions outstanding. While immediately catchy, these illustations are things to linger over. A parent reading &#34;Alice in Wondrland&#34; or &#34;Rip van Winkle&#34; or any other work he illustrated to a child would be wise to share Rackam's pictures with the child. For fans of Richard Wagner's &#34;Ring Cycle,&#34; that has a few examples here, I'd recommed Dover's compilation of his complete illustrations.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|This is a good album.  Lots of really beautiful moments.  There's a good bit of synth mixing the soundscapes.  Luckily, the production doesn't sound brickwalled.  Hopefully, it will sound as good on the cd as the MP3's I've been listening to (never thought I would have to say that...).  Not really a shredding album like Surfing with the Alien, but it's really pretty.  I kind of like the sound of his guitar through his old Peavey JSX instead of the Marshall... less mid fizz.  Anyway, it's an all-around good album.  Joe sounds more \\"soulful\\" and searching than he has in the past.  I suppose we'll never hear energy like on \\"Surfing\\" again.  But, this is still really good.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book and all the other Rick Riordan's books! Now I've got another favorite book, Harry Potter AND the lost hero!
B007RTAR64|5.0|Will never opened this barbie....so beautiful...truly a collector. rec'd as promise<br />just love it. Saving it for grand daughter to collect
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|It is very relaxing. Great music. Such a perfect voice. She sang some of my favorites and they were great.
B009R659L8|5.0|This is the kind of mystery book where you can suspect everyone and anyone until the end. Interesting family, business and love story.
0385349831|5.0|This is technically a novel, but not in the general sense of what we think of as a novel.  It's wisdom literature comparable with Kahil Gibran and with King Solomon's Biblical books: Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.  It's not truly a religious book, but it does quote Jesus several times.  This is a difficult reading experience to describe, but it is a beautiful and wonderful book indeed.
B008602KQI|5.0|Parents be aware this has a PG-13 rating for a reason.  It has some dark parts but so does Harry Potter I guess.  Only slight changes from the book's story line but I have a feeling the 3rd movie might just get an R rating if they don't change a lot.
B008D36INE|5.0|Every detail of the performances in every scene of this movie is a perfect depiction the dynamic produced by a relationship in which one partner is limerent (in love) with the other who merely loves them in return.  It really does cause the person suffering from unrequited love to behave as irrationally as Hester does; it takes over the mind.  In this case, what was perfect about this film was how it showed that Freddie really did love Hester - he was attracted to her, he enjoyed her company, and he cared about her - but he did not reciprocate her passion and so could not fill her need for him to be as consumed by her as she was with him.<br /><br />The reason why the reviews for this movie are so polarized is that people who have never suffered unrequited love will be completely unfamiliar with the condition and find it pathetic and completely unbelievable.  Those who have (or, even better, are actively suffering this condition) will feel a powerful catharsis as they see the actors perfectly exhibit the kind of things that they feel - the anguish caused by the tiny neglects that reveal the absence of reciprocated passion.  Even the ending is perfect, he walks out of the dark room and instead of falling dead, she opens the blinds and light streams in, her spell is broken.  I have to know... will it be like that for me, when He leaves?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You can't help but fall in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters despite the fact that you don't want to. You don't want to because you know you're going to lose them. But this book proves that it's better to have loved and lost than to have never have loved at all. Green has created two witty, beautifully-tragic, funny characters that are sure to stay with you long after closing on the final page. You know this because your chest hurts when you finish. And, yet, you feel uplifted. It's a tremendously acrobatic emotion that Green creates inside the reader. And, for that, he deserves much praise and all the success. Thank you, Mr. Green for writing a story so full of love and lovable characters that it makes the reader ache.
B0088TG252|5.0|Denzel Washington is great in this movie.  Very suspensful with all the twists and turns; but who can you trust????
B004SEUIXS|1.0|I love this movie. But this version is entirely in french with no subtitles. If you speak french, then I give it 5 stars. Otherwise, buy another version.
B009K0P10K|3.0|The first season was better by far.  The second one is a little slow, but maybe it will pick up before the end of the season.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I watched this movie years ago and gave my copy away. Wanted to own it again. I can watch it endless times and it never gets old. Just one of the best thinker movies out there.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The show is wonderful. It has a great story line and the characters are intriguing.  Hope this show continues for a long time.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I'm not a big fan of rap, but this disc is great.  I've listened to it over and over...can't get enough!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This was a very cute movie.  Clint Eastwood is truly an icon of his genre.  Would probably watch this one again.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I brought this plush toy pacifier for my daughter. Shes a bit over month but this monkey has become her best friend. The pacifier is a regular soothie pacifier that is suitable for 0-3 months. We put the pacifier in her month and the plush toy rests on her chest.<br />My wife was very concerned with the toy laying on the babies chest, and being to heavy for her. When we got it the toy weight barely anything, so its absolutely safe to lay on the babies chest.<br />To clean the toy we just use Purell sanitizing wipes that we just wipe the toy down with and then we take a warm damp cloth and wipe it down again. To clean the pacifier we just boil water, put it into a cup and holder the soothie in there for about 1-2 minutes.<br />I would definitely recommend this to any parents.<br />Oh and it also makes for great & cute pictures of the baby with the pacifier.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love Claire Danes character; very believable with her manic depressive disorder.  I would have to wonder what would happen to someone if they were held captive for a very long time by someone who does not believe as I do.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|The characters in this movie are so vivid and the storyline so unique, it kept my interest easily throughout the entire movie.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|This was a very good movie.  Gerard Butler is a great actor but I did not like the way the story ended.
B004ZN9ERI|3.0|If you want to add this for it's historical value, great.<br /><br />But as a musical treat the lyrics are sophomoric and instrumentation uneven<br /><br />I know it's hip to refer to this as groundbreaking stuff, but really?<br /><br />I love all of Floyd's later albums and all their experimentation, but this is almost amateurish
B008XGW1CI|5.0|Rowling's \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is, in some way, indeed aimed at her prior audience. The children that grew up with Harry and company are now in their early twenties, the demographic which this reviewer believes will have the most interest in this work.<br /><br />Rowling maintains her direct writing style, eschewing flowery language for precision that can hit just the right humorous note or strike like an angry arrow. Brought to the world of adult literature, it gives a very clear, no-nonsense view of reality, as she explores humanity's darkest corners. From the confusion of puberty to the dark, pit-like trap that is drug addiction, Rowling brings all to light without bias or judgment, but rather allows almost every character to appear both sympathetic and yet terribly, terribly flawed.<br /><br />For this story has no heroes. This is not a venture in the battles of good and evil or black and white, this is simply an exploration into the grey and greyer world of the mundane. There is precious little plot to speak of, and it moves along at a snail's pace - it exists only as the character actions drive it themselves, and it is the characters that this novel highlights.<br /><br />Some are turned away by the novel's harsh language, explicit sexuality, or views into the lifestyles of \\"the depraved\\" (to quote another reviewer). However, the reality of our world is that children come up with new, colorful ways to curse at each other each day. What adults refuse to teach them about their bodies, they are more than happy to learn for themselves. And whether you pity them, fear them, love them, or despise them, the kinds of people you don't want to associate with will always exist, somewhere around the corner or across town. For bringing these things to light in a light that does not judge, but rather illuminates and offers respect, Rowling deserves every accolade.<br /><br />Her greatest achievement may be in her parallels of childhood and adulthood. As the petty (and at times, not-so-petty) conflicts of childhood play out, they are mirrored by the equally frivolous battles of adulthood - and yet, to the characters, each event seems to mean everything in the world. This is because, when one is inside their own novel, everything -does- matter, with unwavering importance, even if in the long term, it's a tiny flash in the pan.<br /><br />Rowling drags the human condition into the light. At times it laughs uproariously, at times it is reduced to kicking and screaming, but it is constantly compelling and accurate. While the subject matter evokes the classics, the style is gorgeously and unabashedly her own. It can, at times, drag as one finds favorites in some subplots and less interest in others, but all are sufficiently intriguing to maintain interest, and rewarding in the end.<br /><br />However, this book should come with a disclaimer: This is not for those offended by reality, or for those who fear the taboo. This is not for people who are afraid to recognize their own flaws in a book, who cannot withstand true self-reflection. \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is for the adventurous, the open, the kind of people willing to view plainly the nature of reality before them, and are prepared to change it.mes, not-so-petty) conflicts of childhood play out, they are mirrored by the equally frivolous battles of adulthood - and yet, to the characters, each event seems to mean everything in the world.

193700788X|1.0|I might have enjoyed this book, if there was a back story explaining why Sookie and Sam should be together.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was such a great book. I cried at the end not just because of the story, but because I wasn't ready for the book to end. So glad that I bought it because I was ready to read it again right away.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book is entertaining enough, in a trashy, movie of the week, kind of way, but it's certainly not as clever as it thinks it is, selectively withholding information just to keep you reading. You read on not because you're in love with the story, or the writing, and certainly not for the characters, but you're propelled by your own curiosity, like watching reality tv, just to see how it all turns out, building to a pretty limp, unsatisfying ending.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|My daughter and I both downloaded it and it did not work on either her I-pad or my Kindle.  It asked me to sign up on facebook or something else that may be why.  I choose not to be on facebook.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After watching two episodes of the first season of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;, I was hooked!  I feel like I have a front seat in the most upper-class social family in England!  From the family to the servants lives, this series shows how human we all are, despite our financial or social standing; we are ALL flesh.<br /><br />It's so easy to become endeared with the Crowley family.  While they have money, they have heart.  Lord Grantham and Lady Cora are like two people you wish you really knew.  Cybil, Edith and Mary are three sisters who you would love to have as friends.  Ana, Mr. Bates, Mr. Carson, Mrs. Hughes, Mrs. O'Brien, Daisy and all of the rest just make you want for a time that has come and gone.<br /><br />From the social graces to the cockney and English accents and the beautifully crafted wardrobes, Downton Abbey is a delightful treat.  I forget the world I am in and take a journey back whenever I'm watching this show!<br /><br />Bravo, bravo, bravo!  Downton Abbey is &#34;must-see-tv!&#34;
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|Really disappointed, it wasn't what I expected at all.  I thought it would be great with all the talent on it but it isn't.  Don't buy

B009O2XY12|3.0|I was actually seeking out a game like Tetris or Bejeweled with a little variance but with the same type of challange.  I didn't feel like this was the challenge that I had in mind, but would be a good motivator for children or adults with no other point of reference.
B00947N6D8|5.0|My kids loved this movie in the theater.  It is a classic to add to your collection.  Covers all of the characters that children know and love and explains their meaning in a great way.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|This guy is the best, it's a good old groovy rock and roll lift up your day kind of music.  I love it.
0007105045|4.0|`Tree and Leaf' (2001 edition) also contains Mythopoeia, the Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, on fairy stories and Leaf by Niggle. *Note: some of which you can find in the book titled \\"Tales from the Perilous Realm\\" *In Tolkien's world fairy stories are not just for children and the magic of the fantasy genre is exquisitely captured, in such a way as to delight and dazzle many a reader (who may have cause to call it juvenile). This beautifully illustrated, elegant volume gives fantasy `the inner consistence of reality'. This edition also contains a preface by Christopher Tolkien (regarding the poem Mythopoeia) and additional information on other books by JRR Tolkien, including the extensive history of Middle Earth.<br /><br />Leaf by Niggle ~ recounts the story of the artist, Niggle, who has `a long journey to make' and is seen interestingly as an allegory of Tolkien's life. Written concurrently as `the Lord of the Rings' was taking shape, it shows Tolkien's mastery and understanding of the art of sub-creation.<br /><br />Mythopoeia ~ the author Philomythus (lover of myth), confounds the opinion of misomythus (hater of myth).<br /><br />The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth ~ Professor Tolkien's dramatic poem which takes up the story following the disastrous battle of Maldon in 991, where the English Commander Beorhtnoth was killed.<br /><br /> This indisputably exceptional book is a must-read for all devoted Tolkien fans and ardent admirers of this intriguing Professor's life, for it goes as far as to explain the nature of his art and to justify his success. Tolkien's love for the common fairytale is expressed through his fantasy works, and it is fascinating to read in this book how they have inspired his work to such an extent. Full of significant meaning, thought-provoking connotation and interesting facts `Tree and Leaf' is an unmissable read which delves a little deeper into the mind of a literary genius and extraordinary myth-maker, whose life work and creation remains today simply astonishing.simply astonishing.

1451695195|4.0|I prefer books that tell a story in chronilogical order. This book is not however. The only thing I did not care for in this book is how many times he repeated certainty while being he describes as the &#34;Wormhole&#34; Other than that...a pretty good book.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|A powerful account of a scientist's / doctor's journey into the afterlife. For readers who have doubts about the existence of god and what follows death as we know it, this book presents the closest thing to scientific proof that there is a &#34;heaven.&#34;
0425263908|4.0|I thoughtI loved Fifty Shades of Grey...until I read Bared to You. Yes, it is basically the same, only without the S & M, but I love it so much more. Way better writing, though still not the best, but who cares? Take it for what it is-Sexy and entertaining. I am putting off buying the third book until my semester of school is out, otherwise, I am sure to fail! I cannot put the books down until I've burned through them.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app not only tells your battery level, it tells you how long you can read, or surf the web, or listen to music with the charge you have left.<br /><br />It's got a lot of features that I don't use, but people who are more tech savvy would probably enjoy. Despite having so many features, it is in no way complicated or confusing to use.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|The Beatles made their official debut in early 1963 and it's easily one of the greatest debuts of all time. They were always popular from their singles released a year earlier but this was before their huge success internationally and their debut on the Ed Sullivan Show in February of 1964. While I believe they get better musically by their next few albums, their debut still beats many of their later works IMO. Please Please Me and With the Beatles both have a certain edge to them we'd never see in their music again, they have a fresh and rawer sound to them which would be gone soon. PPM would lead towards the British Invasion-era which would hit it's height of popularity a year later and be in the mainstream for a couple more years. PPM was written in '62 but it still has some '50s edge to it which was a perfect blend/transition that couldn't have worked better. PPM blends '50s pop/rock, early '60s beat, British Invasion and R&B which launched The Beatles off on a high note. PPM is a gem in rock music from start to finish featuring their classic hits PS I Love You, Please Please Me, Love Me Do, Ask Me Why and their famous cover of The Isley Brothers' Twist And Shout. Production is good for it's time and another interesting thing about PPM is that it was recorded in 1 day. John, Paul, George and Ringo all give a great contribution but John was the highlight of the band on their debut which he ruined his voice temporarily by the end of the recording session as well. PPM is a classic from it's upbeat rockers to it's ballads and '50s covers; Easily one of their best up there with Rubber Soul, Revolver and Hard Day's Night.

B008KOTNVA|4.0|I wanted to upgrade RAM and HDD in my MacBook Pro and was looking for something which I could use more than once :-). This has almost all the bits you may need in your regular use and feels durable. The only issue I ran into was the grip on the driver and looks like I am not the only one. The rubber rings help but it could have been better.

B00COGY2P2|4.0|Another very good action movie starring Tom Cruise. He just keeps on going, like the energizer Bunny.<br />This time a Jack Reacher, a retired Military Cop who went incognito after being burned out on the Job. Only to return to the grid to help solve a murder case involving a ex-military Sniper.

1455523550|5.0|This story was really different from other novels by Nicholas Sparks which I've read.  He really got much more in depth into the sad and painful world of someone who is fleeing from their life with an abusive husband.  And because he got more in depth on this, his main character Katie was very believable in the inner turmoil she suffered about not wanting to open up or get close.  Katie is a character you absolutely fall in love with.  And the book is hard to read at times because Sparks goes into the sad world of abuse.  The great thing is the way he has Katie overcome it.  She is a great, brave character!  The man she falls for, Alex is also a great character, pillar of strength, and a sweetheart.  I really liked the way his kids played into the story, and how Katie could open up to him in part through the kids.  That made the story that much more believable about how someone who can't trust easily could be slowly won over through the trust of kids.<br /><br />I do have one issue with the book which was a twist about a significant character in the story, and who that character really is.  I won't use their name so I won't spoil anything.  It was one of those twists that I just thought added kind of a hokey or syrupy twist that the story really didn't need.  But, I think despite that, it's a really great love story and one of his better ones, right up there with Message in a Bottle.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It was very well written and kept you engrossed until the very end. I am such a softie for romance.
B00902S0IS|5.0|This is one of the best science fiction classics of all time.  It would be good to do a re-make of this great movie with modern technology.  But even as it is, this movie was way ahead of its time.
B004SDEP38|4.0|This app is very limited as it only allows me to view documents. If you want anything else, get the full version where you can actually write them as well. It works fine for what it is.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I won't give out any spoilers .... if you've read the rest of the series, you'll read this one too. I'm glad she had a \\"happy ending\\" and, yeah, she ended up with the right guy.  But there really could have been more substance and depth than a recalling of just about every character who has ever been in the series.  Most of them just got \\"walk-on\\" status, essentially being mentioned in the crowd.  I bought the audio verion and the performance was, as always excellent.  I just think that the ending could have had more meat and maybe have even been built into a two volume ending.  But, short and (kinda) sweet, it's done.  Bye Bye Sookie!
B008393Q2O|2.0|I can't figure out how to use this app. I use ColorNotes now and will have to stick to that one. This looked like it had some nice features if I could only figure it out!
B004P1JEXE|5.0|This book is an amazing read. The storyline is incredibly complex and impossible to second guess. I can't even choose a favourite character to love or one to hate. I'm devistated that the final books aren't written. I reread very few novels but this series calls me to read it again and again.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was a bit dicey to follow sometimes because of the various stories intertwining, but thought it was very original (but in a good way!).  I did find it a bit challenging to read on the kindle because it was important to have a sense of the dates, which was a hassle to return to the start of the chapter to check.
B00BSBY38A|1.0|An hour since we ordered and the status is still pending?  How is this 'Instant Video'?  Red Box is faster.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I really didn't care for this book, although I wanted to finish it.  Perhaps the topic felt too disturbing for me?

B004J4WLB4|4.0|I thought it was a good book - easy to read and I ultimately liked the 'message'.  Was certainly an interesting and unique way to look at things.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Michael Connelly continues to amaze me. The way he develops his characters, both the main character and the supporting players is second to none. Even if you have never read a Harry Bosch character book before, this is a MUST read!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The writing is bad, but you can't help but to keep reading.  Would recommend as a vaca read with hubbie close by!
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|just an awful, crude movie. Reminded me of my childhood of fighting parents, I turned the movie off and didn't finish it. Waste of my money!

B006LSZECO|5.0|How do people have this kind of imagination to tell such tales??  Really keeps you on your toes and makes you realize how some things can be such an illusion.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|yeah it could be better better flow is is ok looks good and easy to use just facebook is getting run over with advertisements all the time less junk
B000QU3CKY|3.0|The movie and plot moved too slow...<br /><br />Except for the sparatic musical jazz performances (and I love jazz music) the movie was boring and had a very depressing plot for the image of jazz musicians...Perhaps that was the intent and realistic...For me it was hard too keep interested throughout with the French/English language mixed dialog...Sound on the spoken dialog at times was hard to hear...I would not recommend this movie to others except for the strongest of Sax jazz music lovers...
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I find I can't do all the things on my mobile facebook app that I can on my laptop...which sometimes is very frustrating.  If you're a facebook-a-holic and have to be ON 24/7, this will quench your addiction but for me, it's just okay.  I'm not an addict.  I experience a LOT of crashes, which really irritates me but if I'm desperate and away from home it'll suffice.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I was a little dismayed when I found out the book is a series of letters but gradually I was able to flesh out the characters into people I cared about and looked forward to more letters.  It ended too soon.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I have used accuweather for ages, HOWEVER, since they've &#34;updated&#34; their software, they've really screwed it up.  Unless you have a magnifying glass you can hardly read the forecast temperatures etc.  The font is super small.  They used to have a real nice format, readable, pleasant to the eye, easy to  navigate but now....forget it.  I uninstalled it from my iPhone too and went with Yahoo Weather instead it's much better in my opinion.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|OK but not as good as the other Grishams.  It was hard ti get over the fact that the &#34;hero&#34; was, in fact, a racketeer.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|I actually loved this movie.  It was full of a few twist and turns, but at it's core it was a beautiful Romance Movie about two lonely souls leaving desperate situations to finally blossom into what Love is meant to be.  Just have to say never saw the last twist coming though.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Best album I have heard in a long time.  Great buy and worth the price!  I actually liked all of the songs on the album.
0307476464|1.0|I thought I would give Haruki Murakami another try with 1Q84, but I didn’t like it. I’m giving it a thumbs down for repetition in writing style & having an overly simple ending that didn’t match the complexity of the storyline.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Enjoyed this book for it's light heart, writing style and setting. Most of the characters were so loveable you can't help, but like this book. Also, the parts set in the orphanage were based on true events which is heart breaking. So glad to know that is not happening to poor children anymore.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing game and way better than the first one with ziplines and caves and how it's only one big monkey not 3 little ones
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of the book and the LoTRs books. I think Peter Jackson did a great job on each of the LoTRs movies. I think the cinematography has gotten better over time, with The Hobbit the best &#34;looking&#34; of them all. I think they did a great job of putting the right stuff into the LoTRs movies. Yes, The Hobbit is a much smaller story. Yes, I think they could have done it in a single film. BUT I very much like the stuff they added in. It serves to give lots of background information that is not in The Hobbit itself, but is in other writings by JRRT. I think the background/added material does a very good job of helping to explain Thorin's motivation for his quest. For me, there was only one small part that seemed overly long and that was the flight from the goblins leading to Rivendell. Other than that, I think the action &#34;set pieces&#34; were cool and entertaining. I have read lots of reviews complaining about the additional material that was not strictly in the book, too much action that wasn't in the book, etc. Why not view the movie as &#34;based on the story from The Hobbit&#34; rather than &#34;The Hobbit&#34;.<br /><br />I've also read plenty of reviews that complain about the early scenes introducing the dwarves as being overly long. I really enjoy all of those scenes and getting to learn a bit about the dwarves as individuals. I like Balin quite a lot. Thorin isn't exactly likeable but I feel like I got some understanding of him and his motivations and reasons for acting the way he does. I think all of this was important to the overall story, and I just plain enjoy the scenes early in the movie introducing the dwarves. It's fun stuff.<br /><br />Let me also throw in here that the scenes with Bilbo and Gollum are pure gold. They did an amazing job with Gollum. The facial expressions, the movement, everything is just awesome. They managed to make Gollum funny and scary and sad and pathetic and dangerous and cute and just freakin' nuts all at once. Kudos. Andy Serkis is amazing in this role.<br /><br />One of the things that I have liked about Peter Jackson's JRRT movies is that he seems unafraid of lingering over certain moments, of allowing scenes the length they deserve, of not just rushing toward the next action part. Another thing I have found about the movies that is particularly gratifying is that they are fun to watch multiple times. I have watched each of the LoTRs movies many times and still enjoy them each time. I have already watched The Hobbit at least 10 times, and I like it better the more I see it.<br /><br />Don't worry about any negative reviews or comments. If you like fantasy stories and fantasy movies, watch The Hobbit. It is beautifully shot, has interesting and entertaining characters (the Bilbo and Gollum scenes are fantastic!), some very fun action scenes, and the action finale is quite gripping.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't put my kindle down I will be purchasing the 3rd book as soon as I'm done writing this!!!!
B0086HGW42|5.0|I'm blown away by how enjoyable this album is.  If you like the beautiful voice, sweet guitar, and lyrical limbo that Jason Mraz gives us, then you'll love Ed Sheeran and this album.<br /><br />To be sure, the superstar breakout &#34;The A Team&#34; is a reason to love Ed Sheeran, but please don't limit yourself to just that track.<br /><br />Make sure you listen carefully to the lyrics of &#34;Small Bump&#34;, but be prepared for a tear or two to fall.<br /><br />Then, I dare you to NOT sing along with &#34;Give Me Love&#34;!  The African-tribal-soul sort of vibe that comes in at the end is a delightful surprise to a fantastic song.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about whether to get the &#34;standard&#34; or &#34;deluxe&#34; version, do yourself a favor and spend the extra $2 on the deluxe.  Once you hear this album, you'll want to hear as much Ed Sheeran as you can get.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00969GFFU|4.0|An experience. Powerful, devastating, moving, disappointing, encouraging, cruel, inspired, loyal, joyous, righteous, hateful, loving. Life, in all it's everything. Brutally honest.
B007REV4YI|3.0|Although the Acting by Lady Judy Dench and the very good looking Bond Actor, was as always, excellent...The plot itself was for the most part, very slow gloomy and depressing...I hope it was just  an exception and not the rule for the next Bond movies....Life is already dark and gloomy for most of us...Why go to see a movie and feel even worse after getting out of the theater...Anyway...Not my favorite Bond movie....I bought the DVD only because I have the full collection...
B009O2XY12|5.0|it is an awsome awsome game sure you have to wait but to me its all worth it! its my new fav app great for when your bored other addicting games watch out best game ever meet a new bordem buster but heres what I suggested add candy crush saga to kindle fire! everone in my family plays this game AND candy crush!

0817439390|5.0|Peterson always manages to engage and impart at least one new insight into the creative process. When it seems that a &#34;decent&#34; image will never pass through the viewfinder again, he gives hope that a new point of view might do the trick. Always inspirational.
B006M4F67A|4.0|While this is an excellent mahjong game I feel that it is lacking some features which would improve the gameplay, one would be to have a visual reference to how many moves/tile pairs you have left.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great Book. It really tells a great story of what they go thru in training and the inside to what a sniper is thinking before and after he pulls the trigger. BTW Ex Gov Jesse Ventura is a whining wimp.

B00ADQCBEY|3.0|This series is interesting, but it is very violent with a lot of graphic sex that really is not necessary.  I can deal with the violence since LA is a cesspool of violence, and it probably portrays what happens in the slum areas with the gangs, but the graphic sex scenes really do not add anything to the story.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|The more I remember to use it, the more I appreciate how handy it is. All in all, very useful!<br /><br />Update 12/3/13. This app has become THE place for my lists of things to remember for the future (items to take on travels), settings for the induction stove, packing lists, a few special recipes, and so on -- 27 separate Notes and counting. I like the choice of background colors, which is how I sort. Also, a useful feature is the choice of a list or a checklist, for each has its distinct function. I use each, as appropriate. Also, it syncs between my cellphone and laptop. I don't use the Calendar on this app, but the rest is a world-beater. Recommended!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I think that I may have turned the pages of this book just a bit faster than &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34;, but only because I knew the character, Lisbeth Salander, from that book.  I am looking forward to reading &#34;The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest&#34;.  One wonders what other great tales the author Stieg Larsson took with him to his most untimely grave.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This Movie was great!, loved it. It did not try to be any thing other than what it was! The best part of the movie, or the message for me was, \\"every one has something to offer to everyone.\\" And never not say what needs to be said.

B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Well, I loved Knocked up, but  this movie made me think that the only thing I should do before I hit 40 is die, not get married, my parents are horrible and they are the reason that life is as bad as it's portrayed in this movie. You stick up for your kids and they will hate you. I love the actors but why did they do this movie? Maybe this was an attempt for an art film? IDK. But this movie is crap!
1423113462|5.0|I enjoyed his writing very much.  You felt like you were in the present times, yet he brought the ancient gods to life.<br />The combination of realism and magic was believable.  The author kept your interest with the unexpected turns, mishaps, and sudden reverses of fortune.
B00006AUIG|5.0|I watched this movie on a whim and was pretty impressed. It was unsettling and stuck around awhile. A lot of people seem sort of confused about what the movie was about, I thought it was sort of cut and dry by the end...<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />Gordon gets possessed by 'simon' when he is out inspecting the hospital (you can hear the voice in his head when he's near that crazy b's room and the creepy chair). He goes home after winning the bid, murders his wife and baby, doesn't remember it (because 'simon' was the one who did it), and the rest of the movie follows his descent into madness ie revelation of his actions. That is why in the session 9 tape at the end you hear the doctor talking to 'simon' (this is when everything is starting to go super crazy at the end), he says he takes refuge in the 'weak and the wounded' or something (remember that Gordon was under tons of stress from the new baby and trying to find work). Anyways, that's why he was hanging out in that crazy ladies old room putting up pictures of his family and friends, because they were both possessed by the same entity.<br /><br />I don't know I only watched it once, and it didn't all come together until the end, but I thought it was a pretty good movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing storyline.  For those that aren't that into zombies - this is perfect.  There's so much more to it than that.  After one show you'll be hooked.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song is part retro and part future sounding. The retro is Nile Rodgers guitar work and the future is Daft Punk's voice altering to sound robotic. Pharrell does a good job on vocals also. It's just a good song.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I can't wait to get the dvd, .Because as much as they are great musicians, they are a visual duo.
B000FA675C|5.0|Well written, lots of twists and surprises.  Mr. Brown's knowledge of history and the Church is very evident througout the book.<br /><br />A well crafted story that was very hard to put down
B0058SNI58|4.0|Love these shoes, these are the most comfortable shoes that I own, they arrived in good condition and on time, I didn't have any trouble with the order, when I tried them on I was very happy, what I like about them is that they are wide enough so that they don't hurt my feet and they are surprisingly lightweight making it feel like you're walking on clouds so to speak. I recommend these highly
B00BF123WG|3.0|As a version of the historical events leading to the death of Bin Laden, it was ok.  I thought the torture scenes were overdone and the film choppy in parts.<br /><br />Not a lot of character development.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|I always love Josh Groban's CD's.  He has an amazing voice.  I especially like the songs in English, of course, because, unfortunately, I don't speak any other language and don't understand the words and I would love to.  I wish that a translation could be included in the CD container.  For all languages, not just mine.<br />I received the CD in record time and it was well packaged.  Thank you Amazon.com

1596680296|5.0|I am a relatively new knitter, knitting scarves and dish cloths (pretty much the easiest things ever!) and wanted to branch out a little. I bought this book based on the excellent reviews, and I agree with them - this book made knitting my socks easier than I thought it would be. My socks fit great, and turned out better than I expected! I actually wear them! I did not get frustrated and I bought more sock yarn to start a second pair - maybe I'll try one of the variations since the basic sock pattern turned out so well.<br /><br />If you are looking to knit your first pair of socks - definitely get this book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my little brother and sister love it.  it has fun little games and i give it a thumbs up 100%
B000B3MIZG|1.0|I purchased it for my father that loves the music from Sound of Music. I was excited to find a Sing-along version for him as he loves to sing. When I tried to watch it with him I found it to be region restricted. I made efforts to hack his dvd player with no success.
0143121316|3.0|I've enjoyed reading this book and learnt a lot from it. Kissinger provides a good overview of the Chinese way of thinking, and an insight into how it's different from Western strategic thinking. It's educational about the Chinese-American relations starting after the cultural revolution until the present time. However, the author's ego is sometimes in the way of his material.
1449437524|5.0|Hey, it's The Oatmeal.  This is an awesome book.  I own all three books and think they make great gifts.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Love this album!!!  Walk around all day singing songs that are stuck in my head fro the album. Love brighton beach and sexyal religion. Thank you Rod for finally putting pen to paper and giving us some wonderful music!!!!
B000025OTV|5.0|A couple of the songs are duds (like the one where he seems to be playing a wax paper and comb kazoo) but overall this is a fascinating look at one of Italy's great jazz singers, composers and pianists.  The music rhythmic and exciting, but what makes the album wonderful is Conte's mournful, world-weary voice.<br /><br />I had never heard of Paolo Conte before hearing this in a music store.  I'm glad I heard it, for the most part this is an incredible album.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I wish there had been more on the storyline with Anna Kendrick and Chace Crawford.  Funny overall, and even some depth.
030759565X|5.0|Great cookbook! The recipes always turn out well, and are not hard to do. She also has a blog that people rave about.
0785116885|5.0|One of the better World War Hulk tie ins, great story following the warbound after the events of World War Hulk. Overall great read
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This was a cute movie. We had a lovely date night in and didn't expect or what anything too heavy.
0785125965|5.0|great sequel to Planet Hulk, not even a fan of The Hulk, but i couldn't put this series down, highly recommended great read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game if helps you because you could learn from it.if you don't like this game you are cray cray ok
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a bitter sweet story that illustrates how the power of love can overcome evil  It grapples with some serious subjects in a way that thoroughly entertains and amuses the reader. By turns it is sad , thought provoking , and downright hilarious. The characters come to life on the pages as we follow them in their quest for love and a meaningful life.  This is not a romance novel  in the strictest sense though it is about love and human relationships.  In any case I was  completely caught up in the story and didn't put my kindle down until I had finished it !  A very good story and one that I can highly recommend.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|Fun little game for whole family.easy to play,graphics and sound good,Works great<br />on kindle fire HD,no problems at all.reminds me a little of the jet pack game<br />only in ski mode.Fun game to pass time I recommend check it out and enjoy!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved the suspense of finding out what happened, but a little let down, too. Would read it again though! Good book
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable was a replacement, the original didn't last six months! Thankfully, it was free to replace, and Amazon was quick at shipping it to me! This cable works great to charge the Kindle Fire. Hopefully it will last much longer than the original. So far so good!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It is not often I find myself so enthralled by a book I don't want it to end.  This is a wonderfully written book full of beautiful characters yet a terrible story of Irish orphanages and the abuse of those children.  I would recommend this book to all my friends.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|My six yr old loves it and rates it high. I however have not played it. He has it on his nabi2
034552554X|4.0|A delightful story, but too much fertilizer at times and not enough at the ending.<br />I would recommend for light, quick reading if you want a good cry.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The game is about fighting DEMONS and bosses on your battle field . If you die press entrance Not revive  and the game will give you a free tutorial.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|When I ordered this item, I thought it would fit the kindle fire.  It is too small for my kindle fire HD.  It has taken me this long to actually get my kindle so that is why this review is so late in coming.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I choose this rating because it is like Mario but there are bugs involved<br />I consider this to all Mario players you will like it
1451696191|3.0|I liked the movie very much and so I bought the book. I enjoyed reading the first 75 percent of the content. But I did not finish reading the book. At some point, I lost interest. So I guess it is not that great.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really like this game  .  I give it a 5<br />The graphics were very good . It kept me up all night.
B000002LFZ|3.0|The songs are good, but the quality of the CD is just not that great. The music sounds so flat and lacks depth.
193700788X|5.0|Ms. Harris wrote the best book she could, and I couldn't be happier with the way she ended the story. It's her story to tell, so I won't get wrapped up in the unimportant details like \\"who ends up with whom\\" and \\"what I wanted from the story\\" as it doesn't matter how or why it ended, and it certainly doesn't matter what i wanted from that story. All that matters, being a real fan of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, is that you love the characters and respect Ms. Harris enough to praise it if you liked it, or keep your mouth shut if you didn't. It's not very often i get to say i hate someone, but the action taken against Ms. Harris has me infuriated and i can honestly say i hate every single person involved in disparaging this woman. It is not your story, these are not your words, therefore, it's terribly inappropriate for you to think even for a second that Charlaine Harris owes you anything. How pathetic do you have to be to take time out of your day to try and mess with someone's life OVER A BOOK? Your pathetic 30 bucks/book mean so little to this woman, who only wanted to share a small part of her imagination with you, you haven't hurt her bank account, you hurt her feelings. I hope every single one of you has to someday experience the rape of your own creativity because some insignificant nobody decided they don't like your creation. There are so few of you \\"Harris Haters\\" out there, no one cares what you have to say, so please know that you aren't making the tiniest impact on her. She, along with most of literary society, is disgusted by all of you.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I play this over and over again, esp. the second song &#34;I dreamed a dream&#34;. It is so powerful that I have tears in my eyes. The quality of the CD is good, too. Overall, I think the story of Susan Boyle is encouraging. It empowers me.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|If you like cookie cutter scripts with plenty of gratuitous violence, you'll like this movie. Despite a good performance by Jenniifer Lawrence,  there's nothing here that would appeal to anyone with a brain..
B00ARX2W24|5.0|Herb Alpert's Fandango is a fan favourite and this long awaited CD re-release surprises with its superbly sounding remastering.<br />Herb Alpert revisits the latin origins of his Tijuana Brass sound on this album.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|If you update via Amazon App Store, you lose all saved alarms. Amazon App Support and Developer are of no assistance. I am uninstalling it after posting this review.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not good, not horrible. I use it on my kindle fire and I still have a hard time seeing the whole room on my screen. I'm not a fan of social media games so I'm still a bit apprehensive of it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very fun and addicting game. I have found myself constantly saying &quot;one more game then Ill ...&quot; but I find &quot;one more game&quot; is like 5 or 6 or even when my kindle dies:/
B0067EKYS6|5.0|I have rather enjoyed Luhrmann's films. Romeo & Juliet, Australia, and Moulin Rouge were for me mildly entertaining and moderately successful, but while I have been able to appreciate his vision, I have always felt there was something that does not quite gel. Until now.<br /><br />Before seeing this film, I always thought Gatsby was unworkable as a movie adaptation. The 1974 Jack Clayton effort felt stiff and insincere. Even screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola practically disowned it. I vaguely suspected this was not the fault of the director or actors, but that perhaps Gatsby was simply untranslatable to film. I was wrong.<br /><br />Fortunately, Baz Luhrmann has finally found his calling. His attention to detail coupled with his absolute rejection of subtlety works for Gatsby. He manages to retain the symbolism, pushing image after image in the faces of the viewers. This is especially noticeable by those who have viewed this in 3D.<br /><br />His brazen approach is matched with an incredible attention to detail. For example, the \\"man in the cool shirt\\" is shown several times early on in the film on the New York billboard. Also, Nick Carroway is clearly portrayed as Fitzgerald himself who was negatively impacted by the East-coast lifestyle of the 1920s.<br /><br />Direction aside, the soundtrack to this film is incredible! It would have been easy to use only period music, but instead the film includes music by newer artists who use 1920s elements. Rather than watching and thinking, \\"This is a period piece,\\" the music along with the in-your-face direction and production invite the audience to feel the excitement of the 1920s. It is just plain fun!<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an adaptation that finally does the novel justice. Go see it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|When I first got this App, I didn't like it. Then I figured out how it works and I love it. I use it for shopping, recording notes, and even though I don't use it, it has a calendar with planner feature and notification setting. I have it on my Kindle Fire and my mother is so jealous that she can't get it for her Kindle Touch.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The Nemo game is very vibrant in color and a lot of activities to do.  We are still discovering them.<br />Would gladly get it again!
B001F12J0C|5.0|Great movie series, I find myself getting this set out pretty often to watch again and again. A must own.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Like temple run but better! All based on a subway in different countries. When updated, the country will change! EPIC! Recommended it to anyone!
B00BESNKB8|2.0|I am not a big Tarantino fan.  If you like his other movies, you will like this one as well.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|This is some of the BEST indie music around!  Tracks like &#34;Bittersweet&#34;, &#34;Where I Come From&#34;, &#34;Ghosts&#34; and &#34;Heart of Stone&#34; are worthy of mainstream airplay!  This is the best Twilight soundtrack yet.
B0013ND30M|5.0|If you're a parent and planning on taking kids to Disney WOrld or Land please take a moment , buy them the Dinsey Princess movies so they know who the characters are at Disney. This will make their experience better knowing who is who in the Dinsey lore.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is by far Daniel Craig's best Bond film.  It's riveting from the first frame.  The opening title sequence featuring Adele's &#34;Skyfall&#34; is fantastically creative.  I'm a Bond fan and so it took me a while to &#34;buy in&#34; to Daniel Craig as Bond (since I've been partial to Pierce Brosnan as Bond); but Daniel Craig is the real deal.  I was sad to see Judi Dench leave, but Ralph Fiennes as &#34;M&#34; going forward will also keep the Bond brand fresh along with Naomie Harris as the new &#34;Moneypenny&#34;.  This is probably the best Bond film I've seen in a while.  I'm hoping that Sam Mendes directs the next one.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Very interesting book. I would like to say that it is really nicely worded! Jack london is a very good author
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I thought the book was entertaining. The book had good details.I could really picture some of the moments in my head. I wish the ending was different....but I enjoyed the book.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|It's a recreation of the movie Fatal Attraction.  It's a must see.  Beyonce and Idris elba are an attractive match.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|The problem with this musical is that the characters sing 99% of time (and time they have). There is no tension, no dramatic force, no rhythm (or too much rhythm perhaps); you don't see the development of a story that has to be told in an specific way, with economy of means, to make an impression in the viewer; only an almost uninterrupted flow of songs not exactly great, sung by not very great singers, with great productions values and nothing else. The actors were not acting: they were singing, with facial expressions and a choreography very similar to the one that you find in a Leona Lewis video: not bad, but hardly an Oscar material. (The credibility of The Oscars is another issue.)
0385349947|4.0|This was a relatively quick read, with insight into the author's business and personal decision making process.  I enjoyed the practical business tips, and also her &#34;umbrella&#34; philosophy of the importance of being thoughtful about all aspects of your life - and not just floating through.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|This was not the kind of book that I would have normally read but a friend recommended it to me and I really enjoyed it.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Read this entire book in two flights over the weekend, I couldn't put it down. Charles manages to communicate an incredible amount of scientific data without being esoteric or boring. I now want to experiment with cues, routines, and rewards until I change all of my bad habits. A must read for anyone who wants to better their life or at least understand themselves and others a little bit more.
0689835604|5.0|Cute book that let's your child interact with the page sand learn body parts at the same time! Love it!.
B008CP6RWU|3.0|This game gets three stars for its peacefulness, prettiness, and nice music, but I did not expect my daughter -- who rarely plays video games -- to be finished with ALL THREE games in less than 24 hours. She played once more after beating them but didn't pick it up again since the day after her birthday, three months ago. That's a lot of money for (maybe) two days of total play ($30 at the time of this writing). It feels like a waste. Maybe the point of the game play is to unwind(?). If not, I don't really see the point.
141694737X|5.0|Love it - perfect book, love the flaps and cute cute story, it is a go-to book in our nighttime routine.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|I just love this movie. I got to go to a pre-screening of it before it was released to the masses and the entire theater loved it! Anna kendricks was perfect for the part, and it was nice to see her range in this movie, with the singing. It's just an all-around fun movie, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. I rewatched it again last night and forgot how really good it was...I hope there is a sequel!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was well written and quirky. It entertained me and it made me laugh. I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone.
B000058983|5.0|give this a spin as one of the best baroque rock albums you will hear,check out alone again or, masterpiece
B007HO392S|4.0|I've been a fan of Carrie's since American Idol, and have all of her albums. There are some darn good songs here (eg. Two black Cadillacs) but for me each album of hers is just a bit less of a favorite than the last. I actually liked her first two the best, and the last two have been good but not great.<br /><br />She has so much power in her voice that I sometimes think she over uses it. Power ballads and rockin pop-country are great, but a whole album of nothing but power ballads and rock-country gets to be a bit much. I would like her to explore a few songs where she reaches me with the softness and beauty of her voice rather than trying to blow me away with her power.<br /><br />All in all, this will please most Carrie fans, and it's worth having in the collection...but I think she has more in her than this album exposes.
B003062NGK|5.0|these guys were always underrated here in the states,take notice it is never too late to delve into the past for the true 1st rock opera
1878424319|5.0|Have read this book several times and have given it as a gift.  It is thought provoking and a deep read.
B00498YZH8|5.0|This is one of those movies you watch the first time and turn around and watch again to see what you didn't pick up on the first time you watched it.  I live in Missouri and I work with the public and I don't know these people...but I KNOW these people.  I thought they ALL did an excellent job, especially Jennifer Lawrence.  The music is excellent too and I didn't even think I liked Blue Grass!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|It was a gift for someone and the product arrived earlier than expected, very well wrapped.  Excellent customer service and great price.  Will purchase again for sure. About the show, it's all the buzz and well worth watching over and over.  Thanks!
0061950726|4.0|Check out the full review at Kritters Ramblings<br /><br />Two stories parallel in this amazing book that focuses on foster care and the ways it has and has not changed in our country.  A young girl who is close to aging out of the system has yet to find a place to call home and just wants to feel at peace in one place.  The other story centers around an elderly woman who had to leave New York on an orphan train headed west in hopes of finding a family that would take her in and care for her.  They both were abused by families and the system and it was sad to see that we haven't figured out how to fix the situation; if there is a solution.
0811875040|5.0|I gave this a 5-star because of the great price and delivery.  But the book content is so-so.  The pictures and details are very beautiful (the pages have crimped edges), so beautiful that I bought one book for me and one book for my friend.  But the recipes are not true and half of them don't turn out right, especially macaron, the cake, and the frosting recipes.  My friends and I gave up and tried other macaron recipes and they turned out much better.  I frequent Miette bakery in the Ferry Building in SF whenever I'm in California and I love all of their products from the baked goods to the caramels, but the recipes don't even turn out to be anywhere close to the store products.
B000AOEMXM|3.0|On season 3 and have come across 3 episodes so far that are unwatchable cause get stuck.  Packing was good.
B009FHRRAA|5.0|Remastered tracks sound awesome, plus all the other goodies really bring you back to when they came upon & crushed the scene. BUY THIS, totally worth it...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love Downton Abbey, thoroughly enjoyable. Storyline may be a bit predictable at times but keeps you interested and enthralled.
B005IZLPME|5.0|I purchased Ghost Rider, Captain America, The Avengers,& The Hobbit in the last 30 days. The Hobbit has the best 3-D and was a bargain compared to the others. Ghost Rider came in second and Captain America was third. Good 3-D brings you into the fantasy which means things should be in focus as if you are there. The Hobbit was just superior in every respect and the flaws in Ghost Rider could be overlooked because of the action. In the case of Captain America which is a period piece of WW2 the flaws could be lost in the glare and shadows of Art Deco lighting, dust of war , miserable weather conditions etc.. I should have just purchased the DVD of The Avengers because even on the standard Blu Ray let alone in the 3-D, focus and double image was just bad so less clarity / sharpness was a blessing. My system is high end Panasonic with a 60 inch screen. I only mention this because I know lesser systems could be blamed for my opinion and 3-D technology is not quite there yet so selection is also sparse .
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was a quick read. From start to end it kept my interest. I was not thrilled with the ending. I felt left hanging, but understood the reason behind it. Great twists through out. Can't wait to read another Gilliam Flynn book.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Thanks for providing the book, I learned about a great inventor who's work was overshadowed by monopoly, money and power. The stories I read about Nikola Tesla were new to me and I'm sure they are for many people like myself, who only know about Edison and his great achievements. I recommend this book to everyone.<br /><br />harraz
B007BT0RKG|2.0|I was looking for a free app. This gave me very little information for free. When I tried to get additional info I would have had to upgraed. I went for the free Mapquest app. instead. It is great!<br /><br />I would not recemmend this to anyone.
0765325950|5.0|Awesome read.  Good to finally get closure on this epic series.  The author did a great job finishing Jordan's work.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I put it on my Kindle Fire. when I'm connected to Wi-Fi it is really quick information. It's great.<br /><br />I would recommend it.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I was kindof neverious if this book would be any good compaired to Enders Game...but i was extreamly suprised! I couldnt put it down!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Exactly what you think it is. Worth the read for sure! It's very much vintage John Grisham, fast paced, great characters, exciting plot.
B002N44XSG|5.0|This book was great i loved it it more for kids then for teens but its still a awsome book and i loved it
B00006674X|4.0|sOMETIMES HIS MOVIES ARE QUIRKY, TIS TRUE, BUT THIS WAS A GREAT FILM AND HE PLAYED THE CHARACHTER REALLY WELL!
B00CCZ4BFQ|4.0|Too many ballads for me though , I do like it . let's see if it stands the test of time though
B001ANSSDC|5.0|You know when you read a book and it sticks with you? Yeah, that's The Silver Linings Playbook for me. Everything about this book was amazing. I laughed, I cried, and I simply could not put the book down. I found myself highlighting quotes throughout the entire thing and was even inspired enough to make my own FB cover photo out of one of the quotes from this book.<br /><br />The story of Pat and Nikki is heartbreaking, and you find yourself rooting for him to find her until almost the very end. Who am I kidding? You find yourself rooting for Pat throughout the entire book in everything he does. From his broken relationship with his father to his growing relationship with his brother, and all the way to his eventual love with Tiffany, this book sticks with you. This is definitely something I will never forget. Thank you Matthew Quick for writing such a heartfelt novel.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This movie kept my attention and was full of action besides being a love story.  Great job!  Can't wait for the next one
B00992CF6W|5.0|I always thought that $7 was a little steep for this app, but then not only does amazon drop the price but they give all kindle owners 500 free coins. I am now a happy owner of this app which I basically got for free.<br /><br />Even at $4 its completely worth it.<br />highly reccomend.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is super amazing! I don't care how silly people say it is it's addictive and fun. The only reason i gave it 4 stars rather than 5 was because this game boots me out. On any day the game will just stop working. And I'll have to re download it, which sucks because it always messes up  when i manage to get a high score and want to show everybody. Usually I just download it again, because it is THAT fun. It's even more great considering it's 100 percent free.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Much better then the 50 shades books!!! I really enjoyed this series and can't wait for the next book to come out :)
B008S80OU2|4.0|I picked this up from Amazon for about $55. A bargain at the price.<br /><br />You get the definitive first three records (same as the early 2000s remasters with bonus tracks), the pop classics from Agents and Spectres, and the (imho) under-rated Cultosaurus and Fires of Unknown Origin. Mirrors, Club Ninja and Revolution by Night are somewhat underwhelming, but you do get the hard to source Imaginos and enough live tracks (including downloads) to fuel a hundred work out sessions.<br /><br />Sleeves are miniaturist, booklet is minimalist, but all in all a great box.<br /><br />Mine arrived the same day I went to see BOC in Melbourne - over 37 years since I last saw them in London...
B008FSCNTK|5.0|sounds great and got it super fast. She's one of my favorite singers. And the music is really good .Even my husband likes it
B004JC16LC|5.0|Many excellent descriptions available on Amazon. I paid less than $80 including postage to Australia - keep your eyes peeled.<br /><br />The sound is functional, but the performances will spoil you for any other interpretations. Just about worth the price of admission for the Brahms alone... which form less than 5% of the total works on display!
B009G41CG2|3.0|VERY HARD TO SEE, NO HELPFUL HINTS WHEN U GET STUCK!!!<br />GOT THIS FOR MY WIFE  TO PLAY, SHE IS NOT REALLY HOT ON IT EITHER.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|An interesting movie. I thought it was a little slow to get going. I can see why it didn't win the Oscar.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|This book has some great twists and turns. Gets a little slow in places but all and all a decent read... Give it a go.
0756655730|5.0|This book has been wonderful to give the overall narrative of the evolution of prehistoric life. From the earliest Precambrian to the Cenozoic, it is lavishly illustrated with charts, diagrams and, above all, the amazing photographs of the preserved fossils. It doesn't go into depth; so don't get this book if that's what you're wanting. However, I have found the photographs and information provided here to be extremely useful in the introductory science course I teach. No, it's not my primary source of information.<br /><br />One particular tool that I appreciated was the scale provided for the various fossils. It's hard to conceptualize the sizes of many of these animals and plants if you don't have a scale. Almost every fossil displayed in the book is accompanied by a comparison of the animal or plant compared to a human being (including the ones small enough to be smaller than a human hand, human finger, etc). That was a great asset.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I was disappointed because I am a King fan.  The  fantasy was too much for me for me to accept.
B00BAYLS1K|5.0|Been waiting a long time to buy this movie since I no longer purchase dvd's. The bluray is great and with plenty of extras to enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I heard so much about it that I decided to look into it.  I must say, however, that I was tired of the &#34;shades&#34; after two or three.  I had to force myself to complete reading the book.
B00821OX98|5.0|My best friend suggested this series to watch. I am now an instant fan. I have so many tv shows that I watch that I can't keep up with my busy work schedule. But because I can watch this from the beginning, it makes a huge difference. I'm a huge sic-fi fan. You can really get sucked up into this show.
1451668945|5.0|Haven't read yet.  I can't wait to read this one either.  So many books, so little time.  Mary Higgins Clark is the master of suspense, and I have read every one of her books beginning with, &#34;Where are the children&#34;.
B009IQG5LK|5.0|The quality is awesome. Wish there were extra features. But always a pleasure to watch. Best soundtrack ever. Love how many movie stars are in this movie. Definitely one to watch with all ages.
B003L77GG0|3.0|Bought for my husband. We watch &#34;clean&#34; shows and he felt there was more sex and nudity and innuendos in this season...
B000W91RUG|3.0|for some reason i though this was going to be more funny if i could watch all the episodes at once, instead of catching one here and there on tv. But it was more like an overload. I did laugh but not as much as I wanted. Still a good show though.
B006X8GFBQ|3.0|Not really the most exiting SF book ever.<br />The story does not flow well, which is disappointing after reading the very good &#34;Revelation space&#34; trilogy from the same author.
0802473156|4.0|A little simplistic and apparently the same kind of book written many times OVER FOR DIFFEENT AUDIENCES, BUT STILL GOOD STUFF.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I like all of Eric Church's music, so this CD was no exception.  I am totally amazed that most of the songs on his CD's are written or co-written by him.  Great musician!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I started this book this morning and needless to say, I never stopped reading. I liked this book. Truly, I did. But the characters are unrealistic to say the least. It made me cry, smile, laugh, and mourn in a matter of pages. However, like in An Imperial Affliction, the book ends without finishing the book. Readers don't find out whether or not Hazel dies, what happens to Van Houten, anything. I found this hypocritical considering how much Hazel hated not knowing the ending to AIA.<br />Moreover I thoroughly love this book, even if it had minor glitches.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is amazing and addictive the animals are adorable fun activities and you can even change your background I absolutely love it and it is awesome for free
B000VMFDW2|5.0|One of the most fascinating books I have ever read. I felt as though I was in the amtrac with Sledge as he headed for the beach at Peleliu.
0385333846|5.0|His style is quite unique and very enjoyable. The title is not revealed until late in the book and to me was a bit of a surprise.<br />I would recommend it  to anyone. I understand why it is considered a classic.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My daughter convinced me to read this book, as it is her favorite.  I started out mostly just because I agreed to read it.  However, it has become one of my favorites as well.  It is not often that an author brings such deep character development without sacrificing the story telling.  I found myself identifying with many of the characters.  This is a deep look into life in Germany during WWII for many.  I highly recommend this book.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|SEXY CHANNING TATUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is movie is great to watch, Its not just about male strippers it has a good story with it, even though sexy men taking their clothes off doesnt hurt at all!!
B003B96AOW|5.0|This Deadpool action figure was purchased as a gift for my husband, a long time FAN of all things Marvel! He was thrilled. The figurine has several &#34;weapon&#34; options is is very well constructed. There is a definite quality and appearance difference between this figure and the &#34;toy&#34; figures that you can purchase for much less. It's a nice addition to his collection.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have got a good product, and it wasn't damage or anything when it did arrive to me, and it is not dissapointing.
B005PV81MS|5.0|Small-budget goodness, a perfect addition to the cream of the monster movie genre. There are enough surprises to make the formula that much more palatable.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really liked this puzzle-it challenged me to think.  Visually beautiful and the graphics were the best I have seen in these kinds of puzzles. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to solve riddles-this game is definitely worth the price.
B0091REZMW|5.0|of all hidden object games I've tried thus far, this one is the best! Reminds me of hidden chronicles on facebook.
B0016CJNS6|5.0|Arguably, Beggars Banquet, along with Let It Bleed, represented a high-water mark for the Stones. It still sounds fresh and alive after 45 years.
B007C94XG4|5.0|Chipwrecked is a great movie for younger kids.  It kept my son's attention for the whole movie.  As always any Alvin movie is a must watch!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Try to get a good deal. Got this for $3.99 Ya. Again good game but needs a good update. I'll be some glad if they made this like the computer xbox 360 version.<br />:
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love reading these over and over!  I am so glad I got the kindle version instead of the actual book.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Best Blues acoustic album I have heard in a  long time, rock on. Thanks, Joe, I love it. Great job.

B00BCX2F66|2.0|cheapest material I've ever seen. it looks freaking nice but quality of the product sucks, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love reading these over and over!  I am so glad I got the kindle version instead of the actual book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian is a great story featuring good science all resulting in a fantastic read! This one is a true page turner!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like that you have the option to buy in game upgrades to make the game less challenging, but I like it more that you can still do well and have a lot of fun without so spending (real) money. The graphics are really good and I like that they change your \\"game location\\" to keep things interesting. Worth it to have as a go to game! It's certainly my go to!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|got this for my nephew serving in the military, he said to send him movies so him and hios buddy's could watch. thank you
B006LSZECO|2.0|It started out a bit slow, got better with a twist at the middle. My problem is that I really don't believe the ending. I would not have made the same choice as Nick. Some of the twist and turns came out as too clever, like the author showing off a bit.
B000M341QO|5.0|another excellent movie that i sent to my nephew serving in the military. Lots of stars in it. thank you
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I am using this to count down to my vacation. It's writing fine. I'd have liked to use hours only, rather than days and hours. I recommend this app.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|If you are wondering why your old cord doesn't fit with your new mac - this product is your answer. They switched the chargers and I had no ira at first, i just thought I was out of luck on that. Not with this. I was able to use my old charger at home and have my new charger as my travel charger!
0316098329|5.0|This book was the best I have read in a very long time! I would highly recommend it to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its like tottally megally craziley amazing its just totalar fun. You MUST get. Its likes, im speechless about it because its fun and so hippy, its also very modern.
B006M4F67A|1.0|I wish that solitile games would stop calling themselves Mahjong.  The only thing that this matching game has in common with the ancient game called Mahjong is it uses the same tiles.  Mahjong is a fast paced rummy like game using tiles instead of cards.  It is difficult to find a true Mahjong game for tablets.  There are a few.  If solitile matching games would stop calling themselves Mahjong incorrectly, then those of us that wish to find real mahjong games would be able to without going through hundreds of incorrectly named games.
B00170DEM8|5.0|I'm sure this movie is underrated as a Christmas/New Year's Classic.  I watch it every year around New Year's Eve, and I always enjoy it.  The music is good, all Irving Berlin, and the cast is great.  Fred Astaire is always wonderful, and even Sir Bingle is appealing.  Walter Abel is very funny as the \\"rabid agent\\" who doesn't care who he steps on to have a successful dance team.  The different songs for each holiday are amusing--of course it's terribly out-dated with the \\"black face\\" makeup required for Lincoln's Birthday.  People with a sense of humor won't be offended--it's just the times (1942.)
B005K8H8W0|1.0|I returned the records because they skipped like crazy from the very first time I played them. I was disappointed.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|You can't go wrong with this great Christmas Classic.  I wouldn't even want to watch any remakes; no one can top Natalie Wood, Edmund Gwen, John Payne, and Maureen O'Hara.  I think Natalie Wood was one of the great child actors, and I always cry at the end of the movie.  Seeing New York in the 40s with Macy's and Gimble's in competition just makes me wish I lived back then.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Tried it for free, came back and was going to purchase it but have decided against it after reading the reviews. I pay for an app, not ads... Sorry....
B007EDYN36|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  It was a little depressing at times but it does show what drugs and alcohol abuse will do to you. His story has a nice redemption quality to it.  Overall very good
B003NB8KE6|4.0|I like these pants,but too long for me!<br /><br />I'm 173cm / 83kg,so i picked the medium size, still too long!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|If you like hidden object games then you will like this game. It has a lot of fun challenges and rewards you can earn. I suggest this game if you wanna play a fun hidden object game.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|loved this movie. possibly one of my favorites of 2013. i would say that its worth the buy. go for it
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I should have read the fine print, you need FB to play, thus I deleted the app. Like most kindle games, there should be a way to play with anonymous players without the FB connection, but there is not.<br />LAME!!!
B00669MFA2|5.0|It stays true to the novel. Would have liked it to be 2 hours longer because it seemed so short compared to the novel.
B008MX7Z32|2.0|If you are considering this, make sure you consider it being plugged in more often. The battery hardly lasts an hour. If plugged in to your laptop though, you should be good. Especially since it does not really take up a USB port, having a USB port in itself making it a hub.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|First Neal, then Nick. but the Beard still rocks. Please let me comment on the two recent replacements. Actually, I do not consider Jimmy a replacement. When Nick took over the vocal chair after Neal's departure,Jimmy took over the drum chair during the tours, while Nick  still drummed on the recordings. As Jimmy has been touring the past eight to ten years, I consider him as much of the Beard as Alan,Dave and Ryo. As far as new vocalist, I think that Ted is as strong as both Neal and Nick. In fact, I kind of like his voice a little bit better. All of the songs on this disc are strong, with good melodies and a mystic feeling. The music on this CD is as strong as any of the other releases, and  continues the upward trend of the previous two. Do not hesitate getting this release, you will not be disapointed. I do wish I could use spell check on these reviews!!!!!!!!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|This album has been extraordinary for decades.  It's an American treasure by an astonishing musician and poet.  What a gift!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Have followed this series since the beginning. Was disappointed that the ending was so predictable.  Enjoyed the earlier books .  Lindacreekrat@yahoo
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is like Apollo 13 for mechanical engineers in that it glorifies engineering and ingenuity. Conceptually very interesting, and quite gripping. Realistic bureaucracy. Writing quality isn't Shakespeare or even up to Red Mars standards, but it doesn't distract unless you're really fussy. I would totally use it to inspire future engineers.
1608871517|5.0|This is a one of a kind book on Michael Jackson's costumes, apparel and accessories written with warmth, humour and great knowledge. It reminds everyone of all the great and good things associated with Michael, his deep creativity and passion for all life, as well as his larger than life visionary style. Beautifully photographed close ups of many iconic outfits and jackets, the opulent styles and rich colours shine through every page. It conveys the magic and mystery of Michael's image created by his loyal costume designers Michael Lee Bush and Dennis Tompkins over a 25 year period, explaining in great detail how ideas were brought to fruition and the deep thought processes of these three genius men. Michael was able to trust them implicitly to bring into being his most expressive and sometimes outrageous ideas! Bush, as Michael always called him comments that MJ thought \\"so far outside of the box, you'd need a plane ticket to fly back into it!\\"<br /><br />This will appeal to all MJ fans and those passionate about costume construction. I use it as a wonderful reference book to inspire my own customised jackets and am constantly amazed at the diversity found here. Michael loved to keep people guessing as it meant they were paying attention... through his stunning stage performances, and his costumes reflect this too. His kingly regalia is described as Liberace Gone to War which is a fantastic image in itself! The one off pieces such as the Dinner Jacket are delightfully explained: Michael presented them with riddles to solve and this one was in the form of late night phone calls asking what every person in the world could identify with! They then had the seemingly impossible task of finding ways to attach cutlery to the jacket. Michael loved this as the clunking metal utensils made sounds like keys on a chain, while the light shone on the silverware and the whole thing was a special effect of its own. Bush conveys with such deep affection the annoying little habits and funny ways in which Michael asked for things and got them achieved.<br /><br />I also have to admire the candid way in which Michael Bush describes the devastating time of Michael's death. It is truly heartbreaking in its honesty. I can wholeheartedly recommend this beautifully written book,  such a riveting read.
B009GEYX5E|4.0|If I shoot with a Polaroid camera on instant film,there's a certain look I'm going for and that look is by no means perfect. If I want perfect I'd shoot with a newer digital camera then print it out with an inkjet or something. The look is part of the charm. Doesn't seem like people are getting it.
193700788X|1.0|When this book came out and I saw the first reviews were bad I was hoping that maybe Sookie or someone close to her died at the end to justify why everyone was so angry. No such luck. How can a book based on vampires not have anything to do with them in the last book? I mean the book had no real story. It was basically a day in the boring life of Sookie Stackhouse. There was some action at the end, but not a single vampire in sight. The small interaction with vampires are basically they come by to check on Sookie a few times and one quick scene with Eric then it's over with the vampires.<br /><br />Wow Charlaine Harris do you really hate the book this bad? Why even bother writing a last novel? I will never buy any books you are writing now. These last two books go to show that you have no loyalty to your readers and you will pretty much abandon a series if you decide you are tired of it.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Have wanted to play this for a while. It was a free game on my new Kindle HD 7. It's fun, but takes a while to figure out what to do. Will probably love this game when I get use to it.
B00C2VGAW2|4.0|When watching the movie I though the soundtrack was lovely.  This is one of the only movie soundtracks that i have noticed other than Howard Shores soundtrack for LOTR (kind of different, I know)  The songs aren't anything special out of the context of the movie but \\"Over The love\\" and \\"Young and Beautiful\\"  are fantastic songs.  Don't listen to the snotty old haters, buy the soundtrack and go see the movie.
B007N85POS|5.0|I love playing Angry Birds. This was a free game on my new Kindle HD 7. I stayed up way too late the first night playing this. Love the graphics. The little monkeys reactions crack me up!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I loved the message it got across. I loved all the characters, but especially Jack Frost. I'm glad he found his place, his home.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|My 10 yr. old daughter and I both bought The Room for Kindle fire HD and Google Nexus.  No problems on the Nexus, but the game movement control froze twice on the Kindle.  Now the game seems to be out of sync with what objects we've already found and tasks completed.<br /><br />Aside from the problems on the Kindle, the graphics are awesome, and the puzzles are challenging for the non-hardcore gamer/puzzle aficionado.  Great game to plug into a large screen TV via HDMI, for the whole family to participate.  5-stars on Google Play for the Nexus, but only 3 for the Kindle edition due to the glitches.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book on the kindle fire HD and I love it don't wait to get it  BUY the book now.
B003QSLDTA|4.0|Lindsey Logan and Jamie Lee Curtis provide some laughs in a revised plot with romantic themes for both mother and daughter.  My family really enjoyed it, after having watched the original awhile back, free on Netflix.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Never got but know it would be  5 star<br />Hoping to get whole collection
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've always been a fan of SwiftKey since day one, not only has it remained the best smartphone keyboard for any format, but their innovations and updates have kept them far out in front of the pack. I would recommend this app to anyone and everyone. BEST. KEYBOARD. EVER.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy navigation. Phenomenal app for idea sharing and inspiration.  Cannot contain my joy at being able to access Pinterest from my Kindle Fire HD.  Makes a wonderful visual aid.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|We all watched this around Easter and everyone loved it. Funny and cute movie, I would recommend it to anyone.
B008JFUO72|5.0|I was impressed by \\"Iron Man,\\" underwhelmed by the character-stuffing antics of \\"Iron Man 2\\" and didn't have high hopes for \\"Iron Man 3.\\"  But it's clear that Marvel's Phase 2 of its overall movie plan is actually a plan, not a bunch of execs sitting around a table fretting about what the audience wants, and the results are on screen.  This is the best Iron Man of the bunch.<br /><br />Like the first movie, debonair playboy billionaire Tony Stark (Morton Downey, Jr.) is his usual intense self, but he's evolved in a new direction since the events of \\"The Avengers.\\" Nobody - not Stark, not the rest of the world, not little kids he bumps into during his adventures - forgets that aliens nearly destroyed New York City.  The world has changed: National fears are elevated by a no-longer-existential threat, security and tensions are heightened, and Stark suffers from panic attacks. Old-fashioned terrorism has to raise the game to get anybody's attention.<br /><br />When a Bin-Laden like villain known as the Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley, doing a brilliant turn in a character far nuanced than the comic archetype would usually warrant) begins hijacking the airwaves with a bomb so intense that it echoes Hiroshima's after-effects of burning shadows into walls, Stark does what he always does.  He calls out the Mandarin by giving him his home address...on national television.<br /><br />The consequences for his action are dire, of course.  \\"Iron Man 3\\" looks the life of a superhero squarely in the eye and says: this is what happens when you're famous.  It's what keeps Stark up at night too; when you've watched the Hulk in action, is it any wonder he can never sleep again?<br /><br />Forget villains of the week, action figures, and commercial tie-ins.  This movie is about Stark and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Guy Pearce does an excellent turn as the disgruntled founder of AIM, but he largely just sits back and let the other actors do their thing.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this movie is an international hit.  It is at times both breathtakingly cynical and terrifically optimistic. When Stark goes on the run after his aforementioned schoolyard taunt lands him in deep trouble, his relationship with wide-eyed but not innocent Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) grounds the film.  It's a reminder that for all the politics and power suits, Iron Man is still a superhero at heart.  And as the 70s-style credits retrospective reminds us, the Iron Man Franchise is just getting started.  Stay after the credits for a humorous conclusion to Stark's narrative.<br /><br />Welcome back, Tony.  We missed you.this movie is an international hit.

B005S9ELVC|4.0|For all the `creative interpretations' of facts in and around the final days of Mickey Cohen, GANGSTER SQUAD proves to be a surprisingly entertaining evocation of post WW II Los Angeles - right down to the very clever use of posters and billboards used during the artistic running of the final credits! This movie captures Los Angeles better than most and in that setting it creates a credible story with a fine cast that, apart from the gore of dismembering a body attached to two opposing cars and a lot of bullets and killings, makes a case for the idea of a group of rogue cops bringing Mickey Cohen down.<br /><br />In 949 Los Angeles gangster Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) has moved in, with the intention of controlling all criminal activity in the city as well as an eye on the entire West Coast: his dream is to rid the crime world of the Chicago mobs' move to take over big crime in LA. He has bought local judges and police, and no one is willing to cross him or testify against him. Everyone except Sergeant John O'Mara (Josh Brolin), a former World War II soldier, whose goal is to settle with his family in a peaceful Los Angeles. Police Chief William Parker (Nick Nolte) decides to form a special unit whose mission is to take down Cohen, and chooses O'Mara to lead the unit. O'Mara, with the help of his pregnant wife (Mireille Enos) chooses 4 cops (Anthony Mackie, Robert Patrick, Michael Pe&ntilde;a, Giovanni Ribisi) and asks another cop and vet, pretty boy Jerry Wooters, to join him but Wooters is not interested: he incidentally is dating Cohen's current girlfriend (Emma Stone). But when he witnesses the murder of a young boy by Cohen's people, he joins them, and they decide to take apart Cohen's organization. Cohen wonders if a rival is going after him, but eventually he realizes it's the cops. The manner in which the dance between Cohen's henchmen and the gangster squad plays out is full of surprises and twist and turns and makes for solid entertainment. Based on a book by the same name by Paul Lieberman, adapted for the screen by Will Beall, and directed with skill by Ruben Fleischer, GANGSTER SQUAD may not be very close to the truth but is still is a fine movie diversion. Grady Harp, May 13ame name by Paul Lieberman, adapted for the screen by Will Beall, and directed with skill by Ruben Fleischer, GANGSTER SQUAD may not be very close to the truth but is still is a fine movie diversion.

B009NY43NY|2.0|I've really loved some of this series, liked most of the rest and was disappointed in aspects of a few of them. Overall, I've enjoyed Sookie's story and wasn't disappointed in the final state of all the characters. It's been fairly clear through many of the books that things would go the way they did, so I'd been expecting it. What I was disappointed with was how they got there. There was no big send off for many of the characters that had been larger than life throughout the series. I felt as though many characters were thrown in for no other reason than to make an appearance, generally adding nothing to the story. It all just seemed so forced.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is an excellent and inspiring book. Very uplifting and practical for every day living. Some people we know liked the first a part which is narrative and not the second part which is more reflective. My wife and I love them both.
1451662432|5.0|This book is very thing i thought it would be! I am a huge Arnold fan,  reading this and seeing his past and a lot of the things that I never even knew he had done... Just amazing!
1476734941|5.0|I have to admit I am definitely not a calorie counting type of person. Fasting (kind-of) for two days a week and eating normally the other five days really works for me. The book is really not necessary to follow this program, but it does provide some meals plans for the fasting days and gives you some insight into how the program was developed. I have been on the program for four weeks and I have lost 14 lbs.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Great DVD.  I love Michael.  Very sexy and a good story.  Hope that he will make another Lincoln Lawyer movie.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|This film was enjoyable as the story line was much better than the first one.<br />Ed Norton was ok but I feel they still could have used Eric Bana. All in all<br />a good sci-fi fantasy flick for a little escapism.
1878424319|3.0|The first two agreements were good but I found it somewhat repetitive. I did enjoy the message it was telling and did pass it the book on to my sister and will loan it to friends as well.
B001HN690O|5.0|The visuals are great as is the story line. The dvd did not play in my player(No fault to Amazon)<br />which is an LG 3D Blu-ray but I do live in Australia so I was rapt that the Blu-ray<br />played no problem. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie it is a great back-up to the first film.
B00005JO9J|4.0|I Love Grey's Anatomy and didn't realize the first season was a short one! This is the season that got me hooked!!
B004KV92ZE|5.0|A really funny movie. It is so easy to picture Jack Black as Po as the one-liners<br />just zip out and you find yourself chuckling and laughing through out the film. Adults<br />will get just as much from this as the kids. Thoroughly recommend this movie A++++++
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Love this set. The T-Rex at the gate is a nice bonus. I was hooked on J.P. the moment I saw the first one at the theatre. Highly recommended. ENJOY !!!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This film was excellent to watch and to see how something like<br />Planet of the Apes could have come about was cleverly done.<br />Leaves it open for the next instalment that I will eagerly be awaiting.
B005HSL626|3.0|My kids had me try this one, it is very faced paced and tests your hand eye coordination. However it gets pretty old pretty quick, the kids love it though and if you are looking for a safe game to have at hand for your kids to play this ones for you.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|The long awaited sequel lived up to the hype. Was definitely funny in a<br />way that at times was cringe worthy and at others laugh out loud hilarious.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Pretty good read I'd say. Very romantic and rather intriguing. Very sad but overall a good read for me today.
B003ELMR9E|4.0|Good film, top quality cast and acting. Al Pacino is at his usual best and Robin Williams<br />is terrific and sly in this cat and mouse drama.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I downloaded to be able to check ln weather in an.easier fasion and it has been completely functional in those regards.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Love all things sci-fi and to see it meshed with a western was most entertaining.<br />Quality cast and quality special effects added to a good story line made this an<br />enjoyable movie that I have watched several times since I purchased it. A+++++
B003TH2LYY|5.0|I love the show.  like the relationship that he has with Beckett and the boys.  Would like to see he and Beckett get together s lovers not just for a short time, but a good relationship.
078322799X|5.0|I have had this movie before on dvd and lost it so I was greatful to be able to purchase<br />this film again and enjoy it over and over and over. Peter Jackson directs this movie<br />which was filmed in New Zealand and the effects by the Weta workshop stand out.(Same<br />people that worked on TLOTR trilogy and The Hobbit) Quality Plus A++++++++++++++
B008JFUO36|3.0|I expected more from OBLIVION. I mean. It's a cool movie - - but all the trailer build up didn't pay off for me on the big screen. Tom Cruise was cool. There was some cool action scenes - the whole slick scenery looked of the film was nice. The beautiful Olga Kurylenko made me smile. (lol) It's worth the watch but just don't expect a WOW factor like you do in TRON: LEGACY. Oh - and make sure you pay attention in the movie...don't get up and leave the theater - - there are some twists and turns that might confuse you if you don't pay attention. (lol)
B00B19GKI0|1.0|I REALLY don't know why this movie has a four star rating but my goodness, it is bad! From the acting to the contrived plot, there is nothing to see hear ... move along.

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Have yet to view product but it arrived fast and in good condition.<br /><br />The deal included the entire series, the subsequent TV movies, 3 Mrs. Columbo episodes (that was unexpected) as well as the original pilots.<br /><br />Can't wait to view fantastic series. Happy beyond belief :-)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love this show and are hooked on it.  Wish that season 3 was available also  cant wait until it is.  They sure are making it hard not to watch this show.  Almost soap opera ish but is still exciting with the lives of the help as well as the masters of the house.
0688156819|5.0|This book is a very short read but very worth it! It is typical Tim Burton with his dark nature but the poems are amazing and I will treasure it forever. I definitely recommend to any true Burton fan.
B004GYY714|5.0|From local programs to international music and old radio drama, everything is crystal clear.  The Chinese stations have some great easy-listening.  You need earbuds for this, and charge your battery every 24 hrs. if you're an insomniac.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Angry Birds Friends is a cool game. I purchased it because Angry Birds is popular now and I would recommend it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I highly reccomend it its worth the 99&cent; and its great for beginners and veterans alike! get it now now ppress that button!

B00479SVBU|5.0|I was looking forward to getting this FM broadcaster. When the first unit arrived, it did  not work. Satechi replaced it with another and it works beautifully. I would not hesitate to recommend buying this little jewel and enjoying the ease of having several hundred songs available for you as easily as turning on the radio. I rip all my music to 320 bits/second to get the best quality sound and I know that helps give this broadcaster excellent quality on everything from jazz, to rock, and especially the Grateful Dead. A very good product at a very reasonable price.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Good book, but didn't captivate me.  Slow and I thought main characters were undeveloped.  As a parent it was thoughtful as we always try to determine if we are doing enough.

B004BGH8ZO|4.0|I like the songs on this album, though some can be a tad depressing (hey - it's about heroin, after all).  This album tells a story of getting clean, so many songs are also uplifting.  It is fascinating to hear about the journey.  My favorites are &#34;Life is Beautiful&#34; and &#34;Pray for Me.&#34;  Some great songs to crank up in the car.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoy this album, though I would not label it as an epic rock album.
1451620829|4.0|Peter would have benefited greatly if he had taken a Valium before he started to write this book because it might have taken the edge off his anger, if even just a wee bit.  To say that Peter is p*ssed would be like saying Michaelangelo is a house painter.<br /><br />Reading this one gets the opportunity to consider how some people 'have it all', and then really have nothing.  It wasn't like Peter had nothing, he just takes everything for granted, excuses himself for the multiple mistakes he made, career blunder, money blunders, marriage and family blunders and even at times, for his seemingly incredible coke habit.<br /><br />Through the middle of the book, as Peter is trying to tell of his frustrations of being in one of the most successful bands in the history of recorded music, and he is p*ssed.  At everyone.  At everything.  So he does some blow.  And then he shoots up his house.  And then he does some blow.  And he gets divorced.  And he does some blow.  And he starts losing everything.  And he does some blow.<br /><br />In the end, after all of the ups and downs, the opportunity to recover his lost fortune, when all of his solo efforts have produced mediocre results at best, a third marriage seems to rescue Peter.  He overcomes his demons for the most part, survives even more trials and tribulations, quits doing blow and tries to assemble the remaining pieces of his life.<br /><br />It is always interesting, for me, to read what the inside looks like, to hear the stories that managers and press agents kept secret for so long.  Peter had a remarkable career, he p*ssed it away, recovered some of it and now lives a quiet life and to that end he tells a very good story.  If only he didn't retain so much anger for the things he didn't get right this would have been a lot more fun to read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't know what I was expecting when I started reading this book but I am now filled with a deeper appreciation for the love of my life and a deeper understanding of the fight my own father had with cancer.<br /><br />The characters reminded me of people I have met in real life and it was a reminder that anyone wishing they had such a terrible affliction for attention or pity must not truly understand how the disease affects all that are involved.  Cancer perks are not something to be envied.<br /><br />All in all an excellent read that I could have finished in one sitting but chose to savor, which is the only logical thing to do when the characters are afflicted as they are. Of course the author's prose can be slowly enjoyed of plowed through
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|This game is made amazingly well...however, it ruined my kindle. It would not turn off or on but just sit with a glow. I was barely able to tweak it and uninstall.

But it was fascinating to read about her survival out there and the amount of planning it took to accomplish her goal.  The emotional component that drove her really made be think of my own early adult trials and tribulations.  She is a very talented writer!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have always loved this series, but the ending of such a great series was just utter disappointment. I will admit I am a big Eric fan. I often wondered how and if his relationship with Sookie would work in the end, but what I didn't expect was that Eric isn't in this book much. His character just wasn't his character in the end if you know  what I mean. I know authors can't make all fans happy, but this book just didn't feel like a Sookie book at all :( Sorry to see the series end this way.

0679731725|3.0|It's been a week since I finished \\"The Remains of the Day\\", and, to be honest, I'm still not entirely sure what to make of it. I picked this book up for two reasons; first, I'd heard great things about Kazuo Ishiguro. The second was that, as Booker Prize winner, I figured it had to be good. And, while the writing itself is gorgeous - and the story held me more than I thought it would - I'm still not entirely sure what the big deal is about.<br /><br />The book revolves around an aging butler, Mr. Stevens. The year is 1956, and the home Stevens works at, Darlington Manor, has recently been sold to an American. While he is busy moving things across the Atlantic, the new owner lends Stevens his car and tells him to take a vacation. The butler decides to head west, to visit a Miss Kenton, a former housekeeper at the estate. Along the way he meets interesting people and recalls events of the past, when Darlington Manor was in its heyday.<br /><br />Truly, this is the story of a way of life - that of the landed gentry - falling out of favor following World War II. The first world war led to the decline of the great houses of England, but it was the second that nearly finished them off. Stevens knows that the life he once lived has gone by the wayside, and with the arrival of the new owner and new expectations (including how to be funny), he must find a way to adapt to this new life. He considers what it means to be a great butler, gives examples of different adventures Lord Darlington and the house went through in the inter-war period, and discusses various staff members he has known. Meanwhile, he tools across the English countryside, visiting places he's only read about and meeting people he never thought he would come across.<br /><br />The moral of the story, if there is one, is that the past - the past way of life, as well as the glory the time period itself held - cannot be reclaimed. Each of our lives takes its own twists and turns, and we have more control over our destiny than we give ourselves credit for. As I mentioned above, Ishiguro paints a gorgeous picture of the world he has created, but the book hit me more as lukewarm than anything else.

Giving in to Your Desires vs. Being Responsible and Faithful to your Family. All of the characters struggle with their dreams of what their life would be like and the reality of what it is and where it is going. They are pricked and prodded  by their consciences, the consequences of actions taken and not taken, and where their future is going. The dialogue and the acting is stellar!

0893860468|4.0|As most of the 200 + reviews here attest, \\"I Am That\\" is an outstanding Advaita Vedanta text and a great read. In fact, the book is such an engrossing read--thanks to the intimate question-answer format with the inimitable and charismatic Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj--that after rereading it for the second time, I debated whether to give it five stars or four. But because the book is not without considerable flaws, I finally decided on four--and I'll explain why.<br /><br />First off, even though \\"I Am That\\" rates as an outstanding Advaita Vedanta text when compared against the books of the various post-Ramana Maharshi Advaita Vedanta (and neo-Advaita Vedanta)\\"gurus,\\" it pales in comparison to Ramana Maharshi's teachings.<br /><br />The questions in \\"I am That\\" are all softballs, fine for beginners but lacking meat for serious seekers interested in the esoteric dimension of spiritual life. Unlike Ramana Maharshi's \\"Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi,\\" (avoid the dumbed-down Inner Directions version) and \\"Sri Ramana Gita,\\" \\"I Am That,\\" never broaches the functions of the Hridayam (Spiritual Heart) and the Amrita Nadi (Immortal \\"Nerve\\" Channel) in the Self-realization process. And whereas Maharshi, almost like a Kashmir Shaivism guru, moves beyond the limited radius of Advaita Vedanta (a static, reductive philosophy) and talks about Shakti and Kundalini (another name for the dynamic Self, according to Maharshi), Maharaj never ventures into the realm of Spirit-energy. He talks (and only vaguely) about merging one's consciousness with the life-force--but the highest Yoga isn't about uniting one's consciousness (contracted Siva) with the life-force; it's about uniting it with Shakti, Spirit-power.<br /><br />Whereas \\"I Am That\\" is good at describing the Self-realized state (at least from Maharaj's perspective), it is poor at prescribing a specific, detailed practice for realizing the Self. Contrast this with Ramana Maharshi's Self-enquiry method, which is based on undermining the false ego-`I,' and \\"falling into the Heart,\\" and thereby realizing the transcendental `I,' or Self.<br /><br />I recommend \\"I Am That\\" because it is a good, basic Advaita Vedanta text and a great read--but if you want to encounter Advaita Vedanta on a higher level, move on to Ramana Maharshi. And if you want to encounter Dharmas superior to Advaita Vedanta (which doesn't account for the Self as Siva-Shakti; only as Siva), then move on to Hindu Kashmir Shaivism, Tibetan Dzogchen, and Adi Da's Daism.e false ego-`I,' and \\"falling into the Heart,\\" and thereby realizing the transcendental `I,' or Self.<br /><br />I recommend \\"I Am That\\" because it is a good, basic Advaita Vedanta text and a great read--but if you want to encounter Advaita Vedanta on a higher level, move on to Ramana Maharshi.

It uses the time-difference story device used in a few other romances, the difference here is that they finally &#34;beat&#34; the time problem in a nail-biting way. Fun, with ups and downs, interesting plot and you see clues that later come to pass. Before watching it, be sure you fix securely in your mind which year each character represents.

Usually, there are places here and there in a book that are a little slow, or cumbersome, or confusing.  Not so this one, however.  It was a pleasure to read from cover to cover.

0141182504|4.0|\\"The Outsider\\" by Albert Camus centres on an anti-hero, Meursault, a colonial Algerian, who is similar to Albert Camus in several ways. He is supposedly notable in his failure to grieve at his mother's funeral though he does sit by her coffin, holding a vigil, which is rather conventional for an unconventional man. He relishes his existential detachment, which could be either an affectation, or a device for winning attention, at least outside an existential novel. But though he does seem indifferent to his popularity, Meursault's apathy does carry him into a dispute involving his neighbour. It seems he has no real motive to kill an Arab who had stabbed the neighbour, just as he promises to marry a girl who is attracted to him. The second Saturday following his mother's funeral, Marie asks Meursault if he loves her, and he replies that \\"it didn't mean anything,\\" whether he loved her, but he probably didn't. Yet she asks him to marry him anyway, even though Camus describes her as pretty: a fine demonstration of the allure of indifference.<br /><br />This lack of concern begins from the very first sentence, \\"Aujourd'hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-être hier, je ne sais pas,\\" which has been variously rendered in English by Joseph Laredo's in his 1982 translation as: \\"Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know.\\" Sandra Smith's presumes to insert a possessive pronoun: \\"My mother died today. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know\\".  By having Meursault lay claim to his dead mother, it is as if he is overwhelmed by grief, rather than callous. Such slight grammatical intrusions show how easy it can be for translators to corrupt or misinterpret other writers' work. So it is important to take note of the translations we read I we do not read books in the author's tongue.<br /><br />Yet Sandra Smith could not hide the reality that Meursault is incapable of remorse, apparently a characteristic of existential angst, and wonders to himself whether he is on trial for murder, or for the death of his mother. No doubt, to many Frenchmen in post-war Algeria, murdering an Arab hoodlum may not have seemed a serious offence; but on the other hand, guillotining someone for not mourning his mother is also harsh punishment even in the most traditional cultures. Yet Camus was enticed by \\"the tender indifference of the world\\", celebrating the disconnected Meursault for his amoral hedonism. He relishes his life in Algiers for \\"the most subtle but most persistent of joys: the scent of summer, the neighbourhood that I loved, a certain type of sky at night\\".<br /><br />Camus narrates that Meursault \\"a man who... agrees to die for the truth\\", that he does not seek pardon with specious sentimentality, so that he becomes for Camus, \\"the only Christ that we deserve\\". Smith adds to this idea in her translation of the final sentences \\"So that it might be finished, so that I might feel less alone, I could only hope that there would be many, many spectators on the day of my execution and that they would greet me with cries of hatred\\", which is a very prolix paraphrase of Jesus' final utterance. Yet though Camus may offer a real sinner as a scapegoat for  humanity's sins, rather than an ideal, Meursault may fail to convince many that he wants to be greeted with hatred to be like Jesus who was condemned in place of Barabbas. Meursault wants the hatred of the crowds because he is an outsider.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0679720200 The Stranger]]r the death of his mother.

193700788X|3.0|I have felt for some time that Harris was tired of writing this series (and I gather she's recently admitted as much). I found the proliferation of supernatural creatures and plot complications to be too much, and the essence of Sookie seemed to evaporate. So I came to this book with low expectations.<br /><br />I was slightly, but pleasantly, surprised. Why the book did include a number of rather clumsy recaps of elements of the overdeveloped series plot, I felt that the Sookie we'd come to know and love had to some extent returned, and the plot of the book itself was enjoyable and reasonably exciting. I concur with those who say the romantic conclusion (to the extent there is one) had been telegraphed for some time.

B000BLI4PG|4.0|The composer has said this movie had the first score using a synthesizer. I don't know how much truth is in that, but the score's brilliant use of it makes it all that more memorable. Also the songs that you remember from the movie, and ones not so much. Desmond Child's &#34;Last of an Ancient Breed&#34; sounds like a song that was written and recorded for the end credits, but then producers and the director then made the last minute decision to ax it and opted for Joe Walsh's &#34;In the City&#34;-- and after a listen it was the right decision. So this was music featured and meant to be featured in the Warriors. I personally like the Opening Theme and the &#34;Baseball Furies Chase.&#34;

0143122916|3.0|This was an easy read. I feel awful saying that, but it went by so quickly and I didn't anticipate plowing through this story. This account of Camp 14 is unreal to the point it seemed almost fiction, even though by all accounts it's not. I can't imagine how Shin has managed to come through this experience. I wish this was more history in this account. I wanted to understand North Korea better, how these camps go started, and how anyone is taking efforts to help these people, but I had to remind myself that's not what this story was about. This was Shin's story. The author prefacing it with the idea that he can't verify everything Shin has said and acknowledged that Shin changed his story sometimes resonated with me throughout the book. I can't explain it but I couldn't emotionally connect with Shin, I found myself in awe of his story and unbelievable struggles, but I wasn't relating, and I can only justify that to it being so awful that I couldn't even picture it. Shin clearly needs loyal and constant relationships in his life to help him grow as a person, and it seems like he's on his way.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|If you love the Muppets then you'll love this movie and its good for the kids who don't know who the Muppets are

B008FTAAG2|5.0|I'm an old dude, who loves Rock music that's executed well and with a difference. I've heard a few of ITM's stuff on Sirius, liked it and took a chance on this album. Must have played it a dozen times over the weekend. Cant get enough of it. Maria has a voice and delivery that is out of this world, and her guitar player (sorry dude dont know your name yet, but I will!) is stellar! A perfect combo.<br /><br />If you like hard driving Rock, with an edge, and an edgy female singer - this is the band! Every song I kept saying, &#34;Wow!&#34;<br /><br />Like other female fronted bands, Lacuna Coil, Halestorm, Otep, StraightlIneStitch making waves and shaking up the Rock world, In This Moment stands right up there and perhaps above...they know how to get the job done, and done well. This is the stuff of legends...a true talent that would never be found on a reality talent show, but where its always found - on the road, in the garages, basements and warehouses and playing an endless tour of small gigs anywhere and anyplace...where the truly talented learn their way...<br /><br />I recommend this album to all women looking to idolize a female rock singer/performer - and for the guys who love to head bang, but are tired of the garbled lyrics and loss of melody in metal...but I mostly recommend it for FANS of hard Rock that leaves you wanting more...while wanting the whip to cut a little deeper...<br /><br />PS, best damn air-guitar album I've listened to in a long time!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I am getting this book for all my nieces. This should be required reading for all teens and early college types
B007RXRSEY|5.0|As in Slash is back! Been a big fan of Slash since the old GnR days...suffered thru the first solo album, and endured all the nonsense with Velvet Revolver and that arrogant jack-A Scott Weiland and his always being late to the shows...!!<br /><br />I waited to buy this album because the VR stuff, while good, never jumped out at me, it was missing something...BUT here it is! The song Anastasia is getting good rotation on Sirius Octane, and I was instantly hooked - because its the best guitar work Slash has done since GnR. As is this whole album. While Myles voice can a bit too high pitched at times - Slash makes up for it. Great guitar work all over this album and the band is a perfect compliment.<br /><br />I hope this is the beginning of more from Slash and these guys. I think he's hitting his stride here and I want more, and more and more..!<br /><br />If you like Slash and good old rockNroll - buy this album!
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I agree with all of you........I thought it was disgraceful to the actor that played Dark Vadar in the original version that they super-imposed Christensen over him in the final scene with Yoda and Obi-Wan.  I mean the only reason they didn't do that Obi is because it was the famous Sir Alec Guiness (who I love, BTW).  Either way, it was terrible mistake for the Lucas Enterprise to that and yes I miss the original ending music and the dance scene where the funny looking chicken kind of lady sings, I want the original back - I can't believe how expensive it is to obtain it - I don't it on special Blu-Ray, DVD is fine, if lowers the PRICE, PLEASE!.  This is a case in point of life \\"If isn't broken, don't fix it\\", because it doesn't need to be.  I am a diehard fan of this series and BTW, I still feel you could have had someone better to play Darth Vadar (Luke's father) other than Christensen, he was not that great an actor, the kid in the first one was way better!  But we can't go back, right!  Anyway, there's my 2 cents.  Thanks for listening.  I hope I didn't insult anyone with describing the the dancing lady...I don't if she was given a name.  I love the original as does my husband. And oh yeah, Mr. Lucas, when the original came out I didn't go see as I am 11 years younger than my husband.  But he and his sister saw at the theatre over 15 times, that's how beloved it is to him and now me as well.  I have my original VHS Triliogy set, but it's kind of worn out, so it'd be really nice to have the original version, again DVD is OK with me.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Follows well from first in series.  Same people with new dilemmas. The series is a little explicit for many people but I enjoyed the detail and seemingly impossible situations these people get themselves into. Well written even as a translation. Went on to read book 3.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett really know how to engage a reader thought historical accounts as well as well developed characters. I enjoyed the first two books in the trilogy.
B0015DROBO|5.0|It took me years to get around to reading this but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Did not know what to expect but was able to follow details easily.  It was so well translated that it flowed in English. Saw the movie later. Recommend the Swedish version. I felt it was more what I imagined in book. Followed thru with reading of next two books in series.

I am Belgian, and even though I had to pay about another 40$ in total for transportation and some tax I had never heard of, it's more than worth it. I'll treasure these books for as long as I live and hopefully my kids to be (once I meet my one true Susie) will one day read them and love them as well.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Fun and addictive. I love poking the dinosaurs, leveling them up, giving them bonuses from the different decorations.<br />Bucks make life easier, but they're not required. You can get them from the promotions and from leveling up/completing quests.<br /><br />Overall, I like this game. It's a bit large and I'd like it if the bucks were a little bit easier to get, but it's still a great deal of fun.<br />It doesn't work very well on the Kindle fire, but fabulously on the Galaxy Note II
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is fun. tons to do. only downside is a short lag in kung tu scrat. so many characters. don't have to wait much like other games.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have been waiting years for this. Brandon Sanderson has turned into my favorite author after taking over the series and finishing Robert Jordans dream.<br /><br />This book did not disappoint. The only disappointing part was that it had to end :( All the loose ends were tied up in my mind and it still left some room for standalone books or mini series. Could not have been more pleased with this series, and this book in particular. Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
B000002KB8|5.0|For a debut album, it's great. When I first heard this album, I was hooked on black sabbath! Great vintage album
B000T433CO|2.0|The plot in this movie is fairly &#34;standard&#34;, yet - at mediocre acting levels - was awkwardly played out.  It dragged at times and the ending, at least in part, seemed implausible.<br />To whom would I recommend this movie?  Am not sure ... I don't want to see it again.

B00AQSN7HE|5.0|Daniel Craig wasn't born yet when DR. NO was filmed and author Ian Fleming felt that actor/songwriter Hoagy Carmichael was<br />the type that would fit the role of James Bond simply because his facial features fit Fleming's choice of the Bond character.<br />  Daniel Craig IS the perfect Ian Fleming &#34;BOND&#34; and I was glad to see,finally, the Casino Royale book finally made into the movie.  It was a long time coming to the screen.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|after listening to the original for so long, it was strange not to hear the talking in between some of songs but, not missed
B00B19DMUE|4.0|... the premise is probably familiar to anyone who is a fan of the horror genre: mysterious evil object possesses an innocent, things get really horrible, and then something happens to resolve the situation (somewhat).  It's well done, but nothing groundbreaking.  The cameo by Voldemort was nice though.  :)
B004WJRF6C|5.0|What can be said... It's Paul's first solo project. He played all the instruments...no maybe about it, I am amazed
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|More of the same, which isn't a bad thing.  (Although, the only worn out plot I hate worse than a conspiracy is the wrongfully accused man desperate to clear his name.  Or in Bourne's case, names.)<br />The plot involves duping a particularly dense CIA Deputy Director (played with expected malice by Joan Allen) into believing Bourne has assassinated two men.  It takes incredible stupidity to frame someone who is clearly/verifiably somewhere else at the time of the killing, and to cover-up this fact, the same assassin tries to kill Bourne but kills his girlfriend instead (yes, that old chestnut.  Nothing like a stale plot ploy to get things rolling).  Basically, this plot is plug and play, utilizing similar (or the same) components from the last film in the same way here.  Joan Allen's dogged pursuit of Bourne is identical to that of Chris Cooper's character in the first film.  Brian Cox returns to do the same things he did in the first film only this time he's manipulating Allen instead of Cooper.  Julia Stiles returns to provide a convenient hostage (she completely disappears after her usefulness to the plot has been completed).  There are the usual flotilla of fight sequences, explosions, and car chases.  Bourne is still grappling with his identity and gaping holes in his memory.  Believing confession is good for the soul (if not later prosecution), Bourne even gives guilt a go.  The story is convoluted and rife with few surprises.  Once again, it's Matt Damon's performance that holds things together and propels them.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The weather is the most accurate information for conditions that I have come across. The app is easy to use so my six year old can see what the weather is going to be like for the day.
B00023B1LC|4.0|I have to preface this review by admitting that I don't, as a general rule, like spy thrillers.  I've never read any of Ludlum's books nor am I likely to after watching this film.<br /><br />I found this movie to be a wild kaleidoscope of utter confusion, solved in the final few minutes with no degree of satisfaction.  But.  It is incredibly absorbing in that we're strung along for the bulk of the film, learning very little along the way, and yet there is a high interest in what happens to this poor little putz who can't remember who he is or what he's done to deserve so many attempts on his life.  I actually found the reason behind the need to kill Bourne a bit dopey.  Bourne was never the problem; the old farts in charge of Treadstone were the problem.  Anytime you construct something that elaborate and unwieldy, you are doomed.  Too many people to keep track of, too many lies, too much of a paper trail.  When things go wrong, as they inevitably do, the first impulse is to lie, cover-up, or dispose of those perceived of as threats; no one wants to get caught, and yet they put themselves into a predicament where that's the only outcome.  Very little of that is entertaining because it's expected.  The only surprise for me was that I liked this movie in spite of the fact I hate these kinds of conspiracies.<br /><br />Kudos to Matt Damon for creating a believable and sympathetic character.  I've watched this movie twice and liked it both times; I'm definitely adding it to my collection to watch again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It keeps you on the edge of your seat,, wondering what is going to happen next. Great series , you get caught up it from the first season.

B00178JDCK|5.0|i got this specifically for that &#34;space reverb&#34; function that adds a synthy choir behind your notes.  comes with an annoying blue LED  that you have to paint over/ remove/cover with tape. the pedal is plastic so mount it on a board, dont stomp hard on it.

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Loved this movie.  I am a Glee fan and it was only a tad short of Glee greatness.  It seemed like it was meant for a slightly older crowd then Glee and I really enjoyed it.
0240816250|5.0|This is an incredibly detailed book.  I was a bit taken aback when it came in the mail.  When first paging through the book, I was blown away by the depth of content.  Everything is covered in detail, from shutter speed testing to getting the best out of every exposure and every print.<br /><br />Since getting this book I have read a little over have and I have gained a wealth of knowledge.  I am a photographer from the &#34;digital age&#34; and I love shooting photos with old cameras on film and printing in a darkroom.  Since the world is now digital I have found it incredibly hard to find quality information on processing in a darkroom. I have talked to &#34;old timers&#34; locally, but I can't get all the info I need from them and its not all in one source I can reference over and over again.<br /><br />This book gives me all the info I need to keep me busy in my darkroom learning for years to come.  The content of the book is for the darkroom practitioner, however they do talk about hybrid processes, which I am also exited to try, as I have some color negatives I want to print in B&W.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Ordered this product for my grandson to introduce him to the Star Wars adventures.  He truly loved the series.  Thank you.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Somehow my previous sticky note app disappeared during an update.  So far, I like this app.  Appreciate that notes can be created in text/paragraph form or as a list that allows you to check off items.  Nice to be able to choose colors.  I do wish it had an option to show the actual note on the screen like my previous app.  It took up about a 1/4 of the screen but it was a good reminder for me.  Having only the normal thumbnail makes it easy to overlook.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I rated this book five stars because I thought it was a really good book.<br /><br />I recommend this book to teenagers because they would understand what the book is about, and it is easy to read.
B0053KWDES|3.0|20 words...HA! OK. This is a really nice amplifier.<br /><br />BUT.<br /><br />The business about not being able to play when on power/charge supply is a royal PITA. It means that not only can you not use the amp on power, but that you have to remember the either turn it off or place it on charge (or both) when you walk away. It also limits its use hours, if you are using it to listen while working, or as I do, to listen _for_ working. I realise this amp was designed for mobile use, but it is good enough that many people notice this fault, because they use it desktop as well. It's enough of a nuisance that I would not have bought this if I had known.<br /><br />I have headphones that were mass recommended when I asked on the Net (AKG K240 Studio), for flatness of response and sheer value for money for studio monitoring. I have always been ecstatic with the phones and this amp does them justice. I have not actually done a true freq response test, but by listening I can tell that it carries output as good as I have heard from 20Hz to 20KHz, again using my confidence in my headphones headphones as the reference. In fact it is good enough that I, who am rather proud of my hearing, was able to pick that I have started to lose hearing in my right ear below 50Hz. :(...but I will not shoot the messenger.<br /><br />I want to give it 3.5, but there is none. I will give it 3, because that power thing is big for me.
B00BP0OL1S|4.0|I gave this as a gift.  The person seemed pleased to receive it.  It arrived timely.  What more can I say?
B005LAIIKI|5.0|If you enjoyed this movie at the theatre or if you want to discover it this is the best experience package. an other excellent movie from Mr Tarantino :D
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's quite fun, and it's worth the download. Albeit I'm not very good at the game, I still thoroughly enjoy it.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I did not think I would enjoy this movie when I saw the previews, but I was WRONG!!  Jennifer Lawrence is GREAT, Bradly Cooper is GREAT!!  I have watched it several times already.
B005LLX582|3.0|I didn't expect it to be a rental disc.  this was a little off-putting as nothing about this was mentioned in the advertisement.

B00COHAUD4|4.0|It was a good movie didnt expect the ending.But overall its a must see movie.And the story line was great.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Never played it when it first came out years ago.  Kinda stupid, in my opinion.  Actually got it on free apps, glad I didn't have to buy it.
B007V65R54|5.0|Excellent book on Forecasting and Prediction. Strongly recommended. Nate Silver does an excellent job of going over problems in forecasting and it's applications in different fields
B006M4F67A|4.0|Game play is ok, but the menu for selecting the game style leaves a lot to be desired. It's too slow to navigate. I very nearly quit and deleted the game after trying to see the available board styles. In the end, I tried the classic board.  I did like how it showed free tiles by simply touching a locked tile. The buttons should be labled instead of vague pictures, so you don't have to try them to see what they do.  Game settings menu should be more obvious.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Nice effort on a difficult subject. If you are looking for all answers about after-life in one book, you may be asking for too much! The book does convey the feeling that death may not be bad after all...

B006VFLIYK|4.0|I like this author.  There was a connection in this book that seemed too confusing to me but good suspenseful tale.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|The shoe was very comfortable and stylish.  I liked the feel of the material around my feet.  It wasn't hard nor stiff.
B009NY43NY|4.0|After reading all the negative reviews and spoilers, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money to purchase this book for my Kindle, but I have to say that I am glad I did! Don't get me wrong, I don't think this was the best book of the series by any means, but I certainly didn't hate it! I have always been a huge Eric/Sookie fan, and I would have liked the series to have the ending I wanted, but all in all, I liked the book. I do think some things could have been handled better, but it didn't keep me from enjoying the story. I guess I didn't think some of the things that got the most negative comments were as bad as others seemed to think. It appears I am in the minority with my view, but I wanted to say it was much better than I thought it would be!
B009AMANH4|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater last summer and couldn't wait till it came out on blu-ray.  You do need to set aside 3 hours to watch it but it is worth it!
B005K17RU0|1.0|The AccuWeather app was the only weather app I enjoyed using on my Kindle. It was easy to access and navigate, in addition to being aesthetically pleasing. However, since the automatic update a couple of weeks ago, it has become intolerable. It's much harder to navigate, makes it a pain to check hourly weather information, and crashes roughly 75% of the time I try to access it. Am uninstalling it from my Kindle, it's terrible.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|I thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch. The actors were amazing in it. QT delivers another solid off the wall movie. Like I said it was lots of fun to watch and it was stupid funny. At the very beginning when old boy rolls up with a large tooth on a wagon with a spring going crazy I knew it was going to be a blast; and it was a blast if you know what I mean.
B007P7UF06|5.0|Quality is good and of course the show is amazing!  The price was just right too.  Completely loved it.  Thanks
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|its a great game for anyone who loves marvel with good graphics and a lot of action . if you haven't seen the movie, you've. got see it. its amazing.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Another great movie!  Packaging was good and the quality of the movie was really great!  Loved this purchase and movie.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  Nothing special but a good read.<br />I would probably read more of these books when I have time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I wished I chose this book as my summer reading book back in high school because I know I would have loved it back then as much as I love it now. Charlie's story is that of the everyday person-he has a normal family, hates high school, loves to read, and is struggling to find friends. All of these themes are quite simple; yet, there is something about this book that is very touching to me.<br /><br />Charlie is such a likable and kind character, and I couldn't help but feel attach to him the moment I finished reading his first letter. He always tries to do the right thing, and his kindness and thoughtfulness are rare for a high school student. There are times where he address the reader directly and says things like he wishes the reader will have a life filled with happiness, and even though he is a fictional character, those moments always make me smile. I feel like we don't tell the people we love that they are special as much as we should, so it is nice to hear it, even if it is from a character in a story.<br /><br />Charlie's letters are sometimes of him just going to school or seeing his friends- nothing out of the ordinary but they are always a pleasure to read because he really examines and treasures those simple moments. He talks about the sunset that he sees when he is walking, and how happy he is blasting music in the car with his friends. All these moments may be overlooked by most, but Charlie doesn't let the beauty of any moment go unnoticed and he makes sure that as readers, we don't either.<br /><br />The ending was a twist that I did not see coming-I don't want to spoil the ending because this book is amazing and everyone should read it. It's a coming of age story written so well, that it gains audiences of all ages.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I'm going to flip every table on earth. This show is so amazing. Please watch it on here or on TV to help boost the ratings.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Movie had me laughing the whole time. Not for the faint heart, lot of cursing and adult language. Go see it
B009UX2YAC|3.0|as an adult who likes to play these games it's not really my kinda thing. could of been a bit better
B00BWJARHO|5.0|great movie, love the lord of the rings movie than you will love this movie. Takes you back to the beginning of the stories
B00C2IJJDM|4.0|[[ASIN:B00C2IJJDM V for Vendetta [Blu-ray Steelbook]]]<br />Everyone knows how great the movie is, what i am going too talk about is the audio and video presentation which is amazing!!  Video is crisp and sharp with no dnr too be found, which can sometimes be hard to obtain in a dark film, and this is a very dark film as a whole. Audio is presented in Dolby TRUE hd 5.1, which is very detailed in every area, this film is very dialogue heavy and every word is heard very clearly, when it needs too get loud it does and goes very low in the LFE department. Their is some very demo worthy material in here, just turn it up and select the chapter where big ben blows up and you will impress all your friends.<br /><br />I bought the just released steelbook version and the front and rear artwork is stunning, but their is no inner artwork with this disc, it is also just the one disc, it does not come with a separate special features disc(i don't think the original did either)or a digital copy/ultraviolet disc or slip so i was kind of disappointed by that but as a whole it will look great on your shelf.
B00BF11STU|5.0|great movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Puts in the mindset of the navy seals. Gives you the story behind the capturing of Osama Bin Laden.
0062197266|1.0|I found the plot to be very boring.  It's been done a million times over, by much more talented authors.  Elizabeth Haynes tried to make her book more interesting by having the main character, an abused woman, discover the grave of her ex's former lover, who went missing, and blah, blah, and more blah. The story was dull and so very predictable. As I said, toss the book into a corner and get on with life.  Helen Vodopia
B003G4W49C|5.0|A great book and a great story around the internal struggles that regardless if you're a genius or an average joe goes through.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|I was a young boy when Top Gun fist came out so of course it grabbed my attention and mad an impact on me.  Some say it's a cheesy movie and maybe it is a little...but I still think it's a good one.  Don't expect miracles with the Blu Ray though as it still looks like an old movie with lots of grain in some scenes.  Soundtrack is outstanding though.  If you love the movie...you'll have this eventually anyway so ;)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found this to be one of the most engaging apps I've played.  It really drew me in and felt like I was in the room.  The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, and the graphics are amazing.  My only complaint is that it over!

B004SBS8LA|3.0|Guess I am just not much into games.  Think this might be more for kids, than retired women.  Maybe I should have tried the plain Angry Birds.
0385344333|5.0|Just finished this book and wasn't expecting much but I would have to say that it surprised me.  Acually starting reading this book that I got for christmas after watching Jack Reacher on dvd. After reading this I could see that they truly did get this movie right and thats rare for book movies.  I am defently getting his next jack reacher book on september 3rd either on my kindle or in hardback.
B004TTHLBE|3.0|It kept me reading but not nearly as good of a read as I had hoped for. Overall grade would be a C-.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|its fun and time consuming but its not worth a dollar of my money. I would definetly get the app though.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was skeptical when I started this workout, but I have been doing it consistently for 5 weeks and have lost 8 lbs and really toned my muscles. I would recommend this workout for anyone who wants to get in shape. It is quick and easy to do for any level. I am definitely going to try her other videos and keep working!
B0057R5G6E|5.0|It was perfect. I love Jurassic Park and I love the statue and the fact this had hard and digital copies.
0345533054|3.0|I've had this book on my nightstand for over 3 years and never got past the first 20 pages. For the past couple months, I've been reading a few pages a day and while it was okay, I was always able to put it down and find something else to read.<br /><br />Finally, about 2/3 of the way through the book, it intrigued me enough to finish the rest of the book in one setting. I'm not sure if it's just me (the book has great reviews) and not my style, or if it's really rather dull until the last part of the book.<br /><br />However, the last 1/3 of the book had some great twists and I was completely shocked by the ending.

B009AMALGM|3.0|Movie came in a good condition, no scratches on the disk or wear on the case.  It arrived in about 10-12 days, but the movie was not scary like the rest, they left it open for another one, if so it better be better than this one.  I would definitely not buy it, I only bought it for my wife because she has the collection and wanted to get this one as well, but definitely not worth spending on...
193700788X|3.0|I preordered this book because I love the series. I was soo addicted that I read the first 12 for a second time just so the year in between the 12th and the last wouldnt seem that long.<br />I dont really like the way Harris made this book go. I would have liked some other things to happen and I just didnt get that out of this book. Unfortunately this is supposed to be the last in the series, but the end still leaves me wanting more. Like its a cliffhanger that will never be resolved.  Overall I was a little disappointed with this novel.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I loved this movie, it was not slow. it moved and was interesting, loved the songs. I like the costumes and scenery. well done!
B00992CF6W|3.0|It won't let me join online it just loads and loads. Even when I had the free version it did this. Is this possible to fix?
1878424319|5.0|This is a true book of life. It's not preachy nor does it make you feel as if you're not trying hard enough. It is inspirational!
0439023491|5.0|After reading the first one, I really couldn't put this book down!  I just ordered the third one, but I've heard the first two are the best.  Best books I've read in a while!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I love these books, but they keep raising questions and not giving any answers.  I really just want to know how things are going to line up to end it all, but overall another win from George RR Martin.  A must read for fans of the series.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|He keeps it classy in this CD, and the songs are very original!  I really enjoyed it..his style is definitely different than his older stuff, but I enjoy it!
B0083Z614S|5.0|The secret garden nowadays would think this book is boring but it is very interesting and reels you in. Overall this is the best book ever.
B000QE9ERK|3.0|An interestingly quirky film from the director of Rosemary's Baby. Roman Polanki's adult stylistic supernatural thriller film from 1999. 'The Ninth Gate' starring Johnny Depp and Frank Langella. Shot on location in Europe. Depp is a rare book dealer who is hired by a mysterious client (Langella) to research a book reportedly written by the devil. Naturally, our hero the intrepid Mr. Depp gets caught-up in the deadly web of a powerful Satanic cult. I've seen this film several times and after each time coming away with a new perspective. Polanski's eye is unique. A must see.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|frequently walk out of house without list - put on phone or tablet as you think of things to add, and list goes with you. then update as things are done/purchased. can have lists for several types of things - to, shopping,groceries, special dates, etc
0812993845|3.0|Ya know, I tell people that my favorite author is Jane Austen, but really it just might be Sophie Kinsella. Only one of her books has ever disappointed me. When I read the synopsis of this one, I almost didn't get it (characters named Lorcan and Fliss?) but I'm glad I did. As always, this book was pure creampuff enjoyment with a slight twist: This time, Kinsella tells the story alternating between two characters of very different sisters. The plot gets quite over-the-top at times, with some of the shenanigans on a Three's Company sitcom level of unbelievability. I think this, as others have said, was the weakness of the book: It just really wasn't that funny. However, I skimmed over these parts to get to the meatier issues, which I thought were well done. In particular, what Lottie discovers about her past, and how the man who's really right for her responds to it, was very touching. I thought both characters learned a lot about themselves. While the plot works out in a satisfying way, it's also in a different way than the standard formula of most of Kinsella's books, so that was interesting too. And finally, I liked that this time her main character Lottie, while ditzy in romantic aspects, is really good at her job and at business. Overall, this is a good, fun beach read!
B0097K21YW|1.0|Did not want it.....but now I guess I am stuck paying for it.  I clicked on the current &#34;free app of the day&#34; and this showed up.

B000001IPL|5.0|SMASH is one of the best albums from the early 90´s, and still a HARDCORE album from OFFSPRING before they sell their music!!!! THIS IS REALLY GREAT STUFF!!!! I remember when SMASH come to the world(1994) and made a HUGE success with raw fast tunes like NITRO, KEEP EM SEPARATED, GENOCIDE, SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN and BAD HABIT!!!!!!in fact, ALL the songs rocks!!!!!TOTALLY GREAT!!!!!!!!
B003730LRY|5.0|A very funny movie. Christopher Lloyd is a very talented actor. He played uncle Fester to a t. Angelica Houston was fabulous as Morticia Addams.
B000002BPS|5.0|WOW!!! This may be my favourite album from OFFSPRING, and one of the coolest HARDCORE albums of ALL TIME!!!! yes, i don´t think OFFSPRING sold their sound on IXNAY, and it´s really a Hardcore with some Ska and Metal album!!!! I really like SMASH and IGNITION, but IXNAY is a powerful collection of fast Punks like MEANING OF LIFE, MOTA, COOL TO HATE, LEAVE IT BEHIND, GONE AWAY and ALL I WANT!!!!!This is from the period when OFFSPRING RULES!!!!!!!!!!
B007HGPBRC|5.0|a harrowing account of the last days of one of the greatest present-day writers.  I especially recommend for any fans of Hitch
B00000DHRZ|5.0|Well, on AMERICANA it becomes clear that OFFSPRING sold their PUNK to play on the radio.....While i like PRETTY FLY, SHE GOT ISSUES and WHY DON´T GET A JOB, they are totally POP!!!! in fact, there´s a new POP feeling through all AMERICANA!!!!! but i REALLY LIKE this album....It´s from my teenage years and some songs are among their best like THE KIDS AREN´T ALRIGHT, END OF THE LINE, HAVE YOU EVER, STARING AT THE SUN and NO BRAKES!!!! There´s some good songs on SPLINTER, but AMERICANA is the last OFFSPRING album that really shine, besides the fact that they sold their punk roots!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love the game but glitches of games not loading, freezing and power ups not working is getting old.  Since New power up of accelerating power ups has been added the game has had daily gliches.  I am ready to quit playing as I can't even use credits I paid for because of glitches.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|While i really like the first 5 CLASH albums, this is their biggest masterpiece!!!! All the songs are amazing, going from ROCKABILLY to PUNK to SKA and some REGGAE!!!! ONE OF THE GREATEST ROCK ALBUMS EVER!!!!!!!!!!
B0036CYKQE|5.0|joss is officially the scariest man alive, he took a plausible tech to the absolute worst case scenario same as dozens of others what makes his the worst is the human factor and that stands as the absolute best and absolute worst of the human factor
B000002N2P|4.0|INSOMNIAC is from a period when Green Day was WAY WAY less Pop ...in fact, this may be Green Day´s punkest album!!! Most of the songs are fast PUNK POP like STUCK WITH ME, JADED, WALKING CONTRADICTION and BRAT!!!! GOOD PUNK POP album!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very enjoyable. I would recommend this to all the moms out there that need an interesting read. I hope there is more to come!
B00004BZ16|5.0|While the 2 disc trip is many times WAY too long, and i tend to skip some songs, SANDINISTA got plenty of songs to be another masterpiece from the legendary THE CLASH!!!!! if this album concentrate only the best songs from each disc in only 1 album, SANDINISTA could be at LONDON CALLING´s level!!!! MANY GREAT SONGS FROM THE CLASH!!!!!
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|Rating: 5/5<br /><br />I have recieved this book in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I would like to start with saying that I really enjoyed reading this amazing first book in the Everville series! I can't really find one word for it! To my mind, I find it as an amazing combination of the bravery from Lord of The Rings, the friendship from Harry Potter, the struggle from The Hunger Games(I haven't read the books yet but I am familiar with it) and it also gave me the nice feeling like the one you get after reading Artemis Fowl! It is a really wonderful combination of all the elements that there should be in a book of this kind. Do not imagine it as a copy of the books I have mentioned before because it is not! Huff brings us a new world, Everville, a fascinating place that we can picture while he reveals it's hidden magic.<br /><br />The beginning of the book was a blur for me but then it all started to make sense. The action takes place in the normal world and also in another place called Everville. There is a great connection between the two worlds and the one who must restore the ballance is a boy called Owen Sage.<br /><br />Owen is a college freshman at Easton Falls University who, together with his best friends, Anika and Dante, tries to enjoy his normal life. But his life seems not to be as normal as he thought it would be. Being drawn into the world of Everville when he expects it the least, the boy discovers the danger that threatens both the land of Everville and his own world. Them are a threat for both dimensions, and the evil from The Other In  Between must be reduced. To save the two worlds Owen has to find out more about The Keepers and Frons and also rely on his friends Anika and Dante while going through a series of experiences at Easton Falls.<br /><br />This book is mostly switching between the two worlds from one chapter to another. It is really nice to see Owen in his normal world, inspecting the university clubs and enrolling in an interesting competition but in the same time to keep a track of The Keeper from Everville and his early times. As the action progresses Owen finds out more things about the Fron and The Keepers, things that will help him in the battle with Them.<br /><br />I really loved the author's writing style and I found the Roundabout competition really interesting! I also liked reading about Carwyn's journey and the obstacles he had to overcome with Dagda at his side.<br /><br />The creatures and beings that Huff invented are really amazing! I love the Fron since they are filled with positive feelings and I pictured them in many funny ways(readers do that I guess).<br /><br />I recommend this book to all the fantasy lovers, and not only them, since it is a rich source of imagination that keeps your eyes glued to the pages!<br /><br />I can not wait to read the next volumes! I am sure that they will also be interesting reads!resting competition but in the same time to keep a track of The Keeper from Everville and his early times.

B000002MP2|4.0|While i´m not a big GREEN DAY fan, this classic DOOKIE must be the BEST PUNK POP album EVER!!!!! yes, this is not Punk, it´s more a POP with fast drums and punk riffs...well, POP PUNK....anyway, DOOKIE got A LOT of classic songs from the early 90´s like SHE, WHEN I COME AROUND, BASKET CASE and LONGVIEW!!!! THIS IS BY FAR the best album from Green Day, before they completely sell out their sound!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever you will have no regrets no violence it's worth its really cool you should get it very cool
B000B589JI|4.0|This item was just that, in impulse purchase. I find myself running out of fuel rather often, so this seemed like something that would be useful. The only gripe that I have with it is the quality of the flint holder, as it is just a soft piece of rubber that is attached to the keyring. The fuel canister shipped promptly, and was delivered undamaged.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The one word that describes minecraft p.e is EPIC only flaw is that updates are rare in the kindle fire HD version. But otherwise this game is EPIC.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|I'm not typically into sci-fi fantasies, but Roy did such a great job telling this story. The reading is easy, and I was able to finish pretty quickly. I feel this story is a twist between The Never Ending Story and the Hunger Games. Owen Sage falls into an unexpected adventure of two worlds right from the very beginning. What makes this story not your quintessential dark world meets the natural earth is the intricate details and the visuals that draw you in. For me, it's the internal thoughts and the emotions of the main character Owen who makes you attached to his every move and thought. You find yourself traveling with him. When Owen meets the keeper- the wise old man, this scene reminded me of Star Wars when Luke Skywalker meets Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda. I like the fact too that this story was not as predictable as I thought it would be. I know many others have said this should be a YA fantasy book, but for newbie's like me, I think it's a good read for anyone who enjoys fantasy. With the twists and turns, you will find yourself drawn right into the worlds with Owen. I think the story easily lends itself to a sequel.
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|Really not sure if this should be a review of the movie, more a review of the quality of the picture. I ordered the HD version and quickly realized had I ordered the non-HD version it would have been a total waste of money as I probably wouldn't have been able to sit through it. I doubt, no, I'm sure I won't order another HD movie via Amazon. Picture quality is un-acceptable, just not what I expected.
1932100660|5.0|Yes, it's a Dr. Phil quote, but it does truly describe how I felt after reading this book. The evidence is so compelling. Reading this book will open your eyes to information that you just haven't really had access to before. Your healthcare provider may not have told you about it, but the research speaks for itself. There will always be skeptics, but this book, along with Dr. Esselstyn's &#34;Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease&#34; and Dr. Barnard's book on reversing diabetes were enough for me to clean out my refrigerator and my pantry and arm myself with a healthier grocery list. It's only been three months so far, but I've never looked back. So far I've reduced my cholesterol significantly and am now taking reduced statin drugs. My A1C is much improved and I've reduced my diabetes medication. The message in this book is about hope for the future and hope for the younger generations. We don't need pills to cure our chronic diseases; we need the right nutrition to prevent them. And if you already have a chronic disease, chances are good that a nutritional change could really help you.

B00004UEDQ|5.0|Excellent movie  Sandra Bullock does a fantastic job in this one  It can be a real life situation and has a lot of emotions in it that we can relate to  The ending is not what you would expect but good  I would highly recommend this movie

B00COGZ8FU|2.0|As a frequent reader of Jack Reacher novels I was very disappointed in the film. Tom Cruise did not capture Reacher's essence and made for a cornball take on the character. I hope for more Reacher movies but please recast and bring on new producers/directors.

B00CL0J99K|1.0|Tony Stark wants to be a hero with out the suit... we get it.<br /><br />He's growing up to be a man instead of a play boy... we get it.<br /><br />What I hate is... there is no point to the plot at all - Iron Man 1 the bad guys wanted weapons to fight in the Middle East and control of the largest weapon company int he world.  Iron Man 2 saw a bad guy whose father was 'destroyed' by the Stark family Hammer wanted his company to overtake Starks.  In Iron Man 3... there was no reason for the main bad guy to do any of this.<br /><br />I sat there and said \\"why\\" over and over.  Why are the Iron Man suits weak?<br /><br />In Iron Man 1, after flying from California to the Middle East, blowing up a militant force, then their base, then blown out of the sky by a tank, the suit took shots from F-22s, hit a plane in mid flight, saved a pilot, then flew home... all on the 2nd power heart.<br />In Iron Man 3, his new improved power source, created by the new element that creates unlimited power barely got his suit to Tennessee?  No continuity, no sense, and what could have been the coolest action scene ever looked like sparklers going off in the back ground.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is an incredible story of a young Ender Wiggin, merely 6 at the time of the book's beginning, and through his young life of military training. The action and intelligence in this book is served with a giant side of emotion, and is an epic hard to forget. It is a great story and an amazing ride, making me wish I had my own Battle Room and army to command. I am looking forward to the movie adaptation this fall.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|i really cant complain at all its a good game i love it. if anything id like a more wide range on armor the only good one is egore plz fix armor make one row armor one row health and one row special itll change up the game for the better
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Was expecting a turkey given all the mixed reviews when the film came out;<br />so happy I watched it.<br /><br />Great flick, well done, great action, acting, great character actors<br />and...Arnold...is definitely back. He was great.<br /><br />Try this one. You won't be disappointed.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I couldn't find too much information on the region coding for this collection, but the disks played fine on my unmodified Samsung blu-ray player in Australia.  This is not a guarantee that it will work in non-US zones - just telling you it worked for me.<br /><br />As for the quality of the movies.  The picture quality looked amazing and a significant improvement from my DVDs.  The remastering is probably not as thorough as the work on the Bond films which look perfect, but this is probably as good as you will see the first six films.<br /><br />Packaging is top notch and the nice slim individual cases don't take up a lot of shelf space.<br /><br />Delivered very quickly and well packaged.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I love how well this is written, it was a little slow for me at first.  I didnt understand why the author was bouncing back and forth between a few characters, but then, when he pulls them together and shows you their connection to each other, it is a beautifully touching story!!
B00884GR0W|5.0|Bloody `ell! its amazing. i have minecraft and survival craft and it easily outrank s them both.i just cant get over how amazing the graphics look on my kindle fire!
B003K16P3M|4.0|I Love the characters, I love the dynamic of the entire book.  It did become a little Predictable, but then when you thought something was going to happen the story changed...  I cannot wait to read more!
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|I love this movie, it was so good to see it again, I can look at this movie over and over again.
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|I have never been a huge Fall Out Boy fan.  Been more of a casual fan.  I've liked a number of their singles, but never liked any of their albums as a whole.  The albums were just never strong enough for me to hold my attention and interest in the band very much.<br /><br />With the sad state of rock music these days, I was left listening to virtually nothing on my iPad, so I decided to give this new album a shot.  I figured the long hiatus would either be great for the band, or the album would be an absolute clunker.  I'm happy to say for the sake of the band, and for my own listening pleasure, the album is very good.  In my opinion, the best Fall Out Boy album to date, from top to bottom.<br /><br />In semi-unrelated news, I almost didn't recognize Patrick Stump when I saw a clip of the band performing live.  Guy lost like half of his bodyweight!  Crazy!  In closing, this album is a must-buy for any Fall Out Boy fan, casual or serious.
0316098515|5.0|great book, very good for chefs and profesional of gastronomy industry!, no doubt to buy it. Excelent for students and restaurantes
1612680402|3.0|I am a big fan of Mr. Kiyosaki and very much appreciated the Rich Dad Poor Dad and Cashflow Quandrant books.  I also joined the Rich Dad website to help further my education.  This book contains a similar message and the last part deals in specific actions.  However, much of the same material within the book was repeated over and over. Its like he has a book contract to fulfill, and had to meet the aloted number of pages somehow.  That said, the Rich Dad series is the most helpful material I've have come across to date.

B00479SVBU|5.0|This is a great mp3 player, very small in size. The 12v adapter is built into the back. Very easy to load songs. Just use your sd or memory stick and load your songs from your computer. The device looks like any other hard drive. No software needed. Plays great in vehicle. Would highly recommend this player. Love it.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Not knowing the 'players' in this 13th amendment history made character identification difficult, but Abe was so great, it didn't matter.  You really got a sense of who he was.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fun game! To progress quickly you will need to make in game purchases though. Graphics are okay and gameplay is like a futuristic temple run with the ability to fly.
B008B3MZNI|4.0|I didn't rate it 5 stars for one reason, how could  they not include the concert footage of the bonus tracks? I waited years to watch Nobody but me, a soapbox opera and downstream but no darn footage! Definitely the concert is superb, Supertramp was a super band and this Paris concert is the proof, Recommended to all 70's music lovers.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I love this album - in fact, I loved the WHOLE album and that hasn't been the case in a very long time.  Mr. Timberlake did his thing, and even if you don't enjoy the entire album, I'm confident there is a least a couple of jams on here for you
B000SEFNMS|5.0|this is a great book, and a definite recommended read! It is so inspiring and Krakauer does a good job putting together McCandless's story without making the book to drawn out and dry.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I love his renditions of classic standards.  This CD had less of that sort of music.  But it's still lovely.

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I was surprised by the storyline.  Wasn't what I was expecting from The Dark Knight.  Good actors as usual.  I think it's worth buying a copy and watching again.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read all the Sookie books and this one is just as much of a roller coaster ride as any of them. Now that the series is over, I plan to re-read all of them.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Fabulous movie based on a true story.  Excellent heroes.  The actors were perfect for this movie.  Superb bad guy acting by Sean Penn.  I was totally immersed in the movie.  You are going to love it.
B005D4YHSO|5.0|I have worn these for over 8 years now (3 pairs). They're long-lasting, very comfortable and look good even after several years. My only problem is the elastic laces only last about 2 1/2 years although the shoe is still great otherwise. Overall a great shoe at a fair price.  Good for walking, hiking and workouts. Kudos to Keen... Robt.

0316017930|4.0|Although I only read and analyzed a chapter, my group members analyzed and taught me about the other chapters and this book was very interesting! It was definitely cool to know and be informed about how there are different type of ways to be successful, whether they were a failure at first or not. It mainly emphasizes the idea of opportunity and taking advantage of it. Very interesting book overall!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie is awesome so I don't need to go on.<br />I just got this as a present and its does work in region 2 Blu ray players.<br />So if you live in United kingdom or Ireland and you collect movies or are just a huge fan then buy this.<br />The English version has 6 mins  cut from it this is the full 143 min version not the cut 137 version we get in the UK.<br />Also I'm told that it has extra content in the bonus feature's that the English version does not.<br />The listing on Amazon.co.uk for this version does say 142 mins but this it is not I bought it and had to return it its only the short version of 137 this should be changed<br />The total running time of the full version is 142 min and 58 seconds so some people put 142 as its not a full minute.<br />As for the digital content(movie and sound track) I have not tried them yet but you do get a DVD copy of the movie plus a 2D and 3D Blu ray disc of the movie.<br />I am very happy with this set.
B0064X79JC|5.0|It is similar to the film in that it is dark and stylish. It gives a nice noir feel and does not dissappoint.
1601252463|5.0|Really loved the new base classes and the alternate classes for the core classes. Especially the Anti-Palladin. New spells are awesome. Feats are cool too.
B00782O7IY|3.0|I ordered this movie because, I believe, it won an Academy Award.  I enjoyed watching it but hadn't realized that it was essentially a silent movie and I really don't like silent movies - which is no fault of the film makers, actors, etc.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Ethan Wate and Lena Duchannes return in this amazing book about love, betrayal, depression, and pressure. Lena decides to run away with a guy named John Breed and her cousin Ridley after the death of her uncle Macon because she thinks she went dark. I won't tell you everything, but Lena chooses dark and light at the end.
0792163710|5.0|Great classic western.  I particularly enjoyed the commentary about the filming, use of telephoto lens to bring the mountains much closer, and the history of the casting.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Awesome song! Love how Daft Punk is trying to revolutionize the 70's. It sounds like the rest of this CD is going to be awesome too. Go Pre-order it NOW!

0321356683|5.0|Book is stuffed with Java best practices. Recommends what to do, how to effectively program in Java. I can recommend this book to every Java programmer.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|The movie didn't have a good climax...I'd say I was disappointed because it had such potential.<br />Rather clean movie though; you don't find many these days.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I could not put this book down. Such an amazing story of courage & survival. The sexual parts of the book are not incredibly detailed which I was happy about.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I used it with my Microsoft Surface Pro and it works great. I use it with a Gigabit to USB 3.0 adapter to work on switches. Have no issues with Windows 8
B00005JM4Z|3.0|2 Fast 2 Furious I feel is a bit of a step down from the first movie, Fast and the Furious, which is saying something.  Fast and the Furious was hardly a masterpiece, but it was a fun popcorn film that knew what it was, and what its target audience was.  This film still has those fun popcorn elements, but without the star power.  2 Fast 2 Furious is one of the highest rated entries in the Fast franchise.  I personally do not see why.  Out of all the Fast films this movie is probably one of my least favorites along with Tokyo Drift.<br /><br />The characters this time around were quite non-engaging.  The first film at least had Vin Diesel, who I am a fan of.  You also had Michelle Rodriguez, despite not having a big role.  Here Vin Diesel and Michelle are replaced with Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pierce, who I did not care for.  Gibson came of as overly obnoxious and quite annoying.  I know it is supposed to be part of his character, but I still found him annoying and not charming at all.  You also have Chris Bridges playing a character named Tej, who I did not care for much either.  Eva Mendes' character is also quite boring.  She really does not do much, and is mostly there as a token love interest for Brian.<br /><br />Paul Walker returns as Brian O'Connor.  Like the first film, I think he is alright, but he cannot really carry a film by himself.  In the first film you have Vin Diesel as a secondary lead.  Plus the supporting characters were more fun.  Here all the characters minus Paul Walker were boring and irritating at times.<br /><br />The villain I will say, of all the villains in the Fast films, he is the most memorable, though that is not saying much.  The Fast films have never had interesting villains, this one included.  The villains just seem like an afterthought.  They seem like just an excuse for cool car chases and races to happen.  This film is no exception, though compared to the other films, I find this villain to be the strongest.<br /><br />The action and car chases are still cool and fun like the first movie.  It seems like they were mostly practical.  I did not notice much CGI which is a plus for the film.<br /><br />Overall, 2 Fast 2 Furious is a letdown sequel and one of the worst of the Fast films.  I do recommend watching this if you are interested in the following films.  If you do not see this first you might be a bit confused.
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|Purchased for my 18 month old granddaughter. Keeps her entertained for the entire movie!!! Great for long trips in the car.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|This is like long haired Satch meets bald Satch. A little bit more of this in Chickenfoot would go a long way.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Saw this movie with my boyfriend. It is a funny story from different perspectives. Reminds me of Love Actually, but for pregnancy.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This movie is amazing! I would recommend to anyone!! Great visual effects and it is something the entire family can enjoy!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game should come with a warning.  I play it all the time.  I wish I could tell you why!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Bad on the movie critics who dissed this movie.  This was a great movie!!!  Much kudos to the moviemakers and the actors.  Hugh Jackman was fantastic, as was Russell Crowe.  Clearly a major labor of love.  Again, kudos!!!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I did not know what to expect when renting the movie, since following the story on news channels on December 26th . I was speechless when I went on this family's horrific nightmare. The movie is worth the watch . Their really isn't much I can add that everyone has not already said. Watch the movie, it will get you from the start to the last minute. 5 stars all the way, at least from me it did..I feel so sorry for those who were bored by this movie. I can see how that might happen if you never loved anyone.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|It is a nice sweet movies. I wish that they made more movies like this. It was funny and cute! My husband and I loved it. It was the first black and white movie he has ever seen and he really liked it.
1595828753|5.0|As a fan of the Avatar TV series, I have really enjoyed The Promise series. It adds to Ange's story and shows you what occurs after the TV show ends. Its an easy enjoyable read, which I would highly recommend to any fan of the series.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I ordered it as a Christmas present and my wife just loved it. She watches it all the time. You will love this movie.
0671027344|5.0|This book is just amazing! It is a very easy and entertaining read that will take you on an emotional journey. It is well written and turned into a fantastic movie. If you are looking for a good read, this should definitely be on your list.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Easy fast paced reading but well documented story of a neurosurgeon's near death experience. I liked that he is qualified to discount the pat answers most doctors and scientists give for these experiences while giving a very detailed explanation of what happened to him and how it has changed his life.
1616550414|5.0|It was a book that my sister really enjoyed because she loves all the Zelda games and was excited to know more about them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story grabbed me from the start. I couldn't wait to get to the end and still wished there was more to read.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|this app has absolutely horrible quality. First of all,  it's so darn slow, it always forces close after about one rounded. Second of all,  it freezes you kindle! Sure a lot of apps do this, but to get out of the app on this one you have to shut down your entire kindle. I highly reccommend that you do not get those app<br /><br />- Please excuse all the typo 's. :-)
B0012DK4ZU|4.0|Possibly the quintessential 70's harror movie.  People doing things no sensible person would do (breaking into a mortuary at night because you think your friend was killed there!), etc., yellow blood, creatures, wiggling severed extremities, etc.  It's got it all!
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|This CD has a great mix of the style of music Katy Perry is known for. I chose it for the songs included.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started fast and never let up. Couldn't put it down. Would have liked a more clear ending. Would definitely recommend.
B008220AVW|5.0|There were some additional scenes and features that made this purchase a good one! I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Good but corny girly book. Overall it was entertaining even though it was a bit predictable. You have to be into books like this to stick with it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This account is so full of insight and transformation as well as down to the bootlaces travel adventure.<br />Honest, poignant, funny and beautiful.<br />Strayed is an excellent writer, courageous and genuine.

1439127727|5.0|Insiders look at the Amierican Presidents starting with Herbert Hoover.  This book is hard to put down once one picks it up.<br />So far I'm through Niixon, and it's a bloody miracle that America survived Johnson and Nixon.  Nixon led Johnson around by the nose and they were in different political parties.  Those two in particular makes a voter wonder if it's worth while.  Hell, they were both self-serving traitors.<br /><br />Hal
1592407889|5.0|Sachi Parker has written a riveting book that I couldn't put down and read within one day.  Having read all of Shirley MacLaine's books and having seen many of her films, she has always been one of my favorites, but this raw memoir has disillusioned me considerably.  Shirley always did seem imperious and arrogant, but I had no idea the depth of her dishonesty and cruelty.  Her treatment of Sachi has been reprehensible and beyond the pale.  From virtual abandonment to actually sabatoging her acting career, her cruelty runs the gamut.  She didn't even offer to help her go to college!!!  But she had enough money to send $60,000 per month to her con artist husband.  He didn't offer to help his daughter financially either.  What horrified me about her father was his sexual provocativeness and inappropriate behavior towards her and around her.  Also, it made me almost cry to read that he would not allow her to read a book!  Are you kidding me?  And he would call her \\"idiot\\" all the time.  These two were horrible parents...I won't go into any more detail, just read it for yourself.<br /><br />As far as Shirley MacLaine is concerned: how can someone who professes to be spiritual be so besotted with the trappings of the ego?  The ego and its sense of specialness and entitlement is the antithesis of spirituality.  If she thinks her attitude and behavior in this lifetime is that of an enlightened being, she is mistaken.  I won't be reading anymore of Shirley's books nor am I interested in seeing any of her films in the future.  I hope Sachi makes a great deal of money from this book.
B004JK61K0|3.0|I like that it alerts me when new mail comes in, but I don't like that none of my contacts are stored.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My family is a big Harry Potter fan and love to watch them over and over.  This is great family viewing for young and old alike.  When we are all together or just my husband and myself it is great to have the complete set.  After shopping around, I found this set was reasonably priced and has all the features I wanted, such as Blu-ray.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Order and view on line,,, AWESOME. Bye bye Redbox & Blockbuster. No lost dvd and late fee from Blockbuster, no scratched junk from red box & easy to use PLAY & USE options on Amazon.
B004NELBPC|1.0|been reading huff post daily for the past year on my kindle fire and once loved it. they recently changed the layout and its awful. cant navigate or even see the content as easily as before. I just use Slate now instead. I hate their new app.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|My 8 year old daughter read the book for school and for a reward we watched the movie as a family.  We really enjoyed it.
B00B8O4VHU|5.0|How did this escape my massive Hendrix collection for so long!!?? I do not understand how anyone could not rate this five stars. It is absolutely incredible from start to finish. The only minor complaint, and VERY MINOR, is the version of All Along the Watchtower is not as good as the other released version. The instrumental pieces are my favorites. Midnight completely blew me away! If you like Jimi Hendrix I highly recommend picking this up!!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a lot of slightly different images on a small board. You need to look close or make mistakes.If you like detail you will like this one too.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|But when you work in an office like I do with, unfortunately, shoddy WI-FI then this product is a must have.  I do believe that I am seeing faster speeds than with a standard ethernet adapter on my previous PC.  Of course, that's not too meaningful of an observation because the hardware on my rMBP is so much different than an HP ProBook.  Overall, if you've got a wi-fi only Mac and have any question of needing ethernet, this is a solid product and if nothing else, good to have in an emergency.
B008133MDK|5.0|So smart, sexy and exciting. Love the writing, and the acting is really compelling too. The final episode is absolutely thrilling.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Theirs nobody to match Jeffrey Archer, I've read all his books and enjoyed them all. Well done.<br /><br />N H Collins
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I'll be honest and say I went into this with lower expectations than I did with LOTR, worried that it would come across as a re-hash of the Lord of the Rings movies. Thankfully it didn't, The Hobbit does indeed stand on its own, thanks mostly to a fantastic lead performance from Martin Freeman who is perfect as Bilbo Baggins. Unfortunately, what I didn't like was the slow, song-filled first 90 minutes. Okay, so \\"song-filled\\" is a slight exaggeration, there are only two songs... but for a fantasy epic, that's two songs too many! It took far too long for them to begin their quest, and when they did there were moments (like the troll scene) that I didn't think added anything to the plot or characters. I read somewhere that there were supposed to be only 2 movies in this saga, but they had so much footage they decided to turn it into three movies. This kinda tainted my viewing, as I felt that a lot of scenes should have ended up on the cutting room floor instead of stretching two movies into three (and making more money out of cinema-goers). But all this aside, I must say that the last hour of the movie in the Goblin King's tunnels was fantastic!! I hope the next two movies have more of this type of action!
B008220D7S|3.0|Very funny people working with funny characters dealing with serious issues, so it is not all comedy. Unfortunately, the movie strays way too much and should have been edited a lot better. If they could have lost 30 or at least 20 minutes of movie, it would have been much better. I was surprised to see Tatum O'Neil in the outtakes, because I assumed that at it's final length, nothing was left out.<br /><br />All in all - not a bad movie, but a renter.
0393320928|4.0|While not as entertaining as his first book, this book contained Feynman's observations made during the investigation of the disastrous launch of the shuttle Challenger.  His observations on the people making decisions regarding the launches (both of earlier shuttles and the Challenger), and also on the people investigating the launch pulled no punches.
B00BI6SSMC|2.0|Like many reviewers, I have been an Iron & Wine fan since the beginning.  The lo-fi acoustic songs with the whispered vocals struck a chord in my soul like no other had done (besides maybe Elliott Smith).  The first few albums shone with a brilliance of poetic lyrics, both accessible and filled with fantastic imagery.  Our Endless Numbered Days remains one of my favorite albums and it seems like it was only downhill from there on out for Iron & Wine.  The Shepherd's Dog was a mixed bag of songs, both good and bad, while Kiss Each Other sounded like a bad imitation of Ray LaMontagne's music and sound.  Sadly, once again, we get another album from Iron & Wine where Sam Beam fails at trying to be Ray LaMontagne.  The problem with this is that Sam Beam is not the soulful singer that Ray LaMontagne is and this is where the songs fail.  Add to the fact that the lyrics of the last few albums are miles away from that imagery that cut me to ribbons every time I listened.  Now I am all for progression, but I feel that Iron & Wine have taken themselves to a direction that is beyond their means and lacks the heart of their first few albums.  Whereas I used to be excited at the news of a new Iron & Wine album, I am afraid to say that there will be no excitement when the next album is released.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love it so much!! I cant stop using ot and I use it every day because I cant wake up to anything else!!!
1416972242|5.0|So far, I am only up to the second book, but I love the series already. Very well written and interesting! Highly recommended series.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|We, especially my wife, loves the Eagles and Don Henley in particular. So we really enjoyed the interviews and the old footage. And the bonus DVD of a 1977 concert in the D.C. area was very good and really appreciated.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's a good dictionary. I recommend this book to people who don't know meanings. I chose this rating because I dint know very many meanings.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Is awesome I love how the book keeps you in suspense and you never know what is going to happen next. And I will let u in on a little secret. Rebellion
B00008438V|5.0|Just a great lil movie Grampa can watch and chat with our Grandson! Brought back memories just seeing the cover!<br />Got it in great time and condition as stand!<br />Thankyou!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Imagery, story, characters, and action scenes all add up to create a beautiful and exciting diversion, perhaps better suited to European, rather than American sensibilities.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|The writers of this show set the standard for half hour comedies. This ensemble of actors compliment each other so well, each episode leaves you wanting more. The difficulty with Family centered sitcoms is that the &#34;kids&#34; grow up. The multiple layers of ages in the young actor roles will provide many seasons of staying power - much like the Cosby Show has done. Regardless of the week's story line, the three family dynamic continues to broaden and become richer. Ouststanding cast, crew, writing and production.
125000568X|5.0|This book is just plain awesome!!  It is all about each album recording and it has little snippets of things you can actually remove - like copies of papers that songs were written on in the artist's own handwriting, etc.  Fun, entertaining book.  I you love Queen, I highly recommend it.
B009AP2G26|3.0|Interesting additions to the cast. Sorely missed however is the reduction of face time of the &#34;adult&#34; roles, i.e. Jane Lynch. Important topics were taken on, but the weekly plots that included the &#34;veteran&#34; actors was simply awkward. LET THEM GO. It's life - at the most, have an occasional &#34;visit&#34; during the holidays. Well written scripts on school shooting, violence, weight prejudice, transgender teens. The NYADA story line was to &#34;Fame-ish&#34; - the Season strengthened towards the end - the catfish sequence was lame - would rather have seen something more poignant such as cyber-bullying/suicide storyline.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Our whole family is addicted to this game! The only thing that could make it better would be to maneuver through the levels faster.
B006HH5Y6K|5.0|If you can't sit around and listen to this on vinyl I guess CDs are the next best thing, and at under five dollars, this is a bargain.
1584282584|5.0|I bought this book purely because of the title; so many books are about teaching you off camera flash (OCF) and telling you that on camera flash is awful.  I read this book a few times and decided to try some of the techniques at a reception I shot.  The difference between the reception I shot the week before and the one I shot after reading the book was night and day; I don't think someone looking at the images next to each other would know they were from the same photographer.  I am happily shooting at receptions, now, with flashes on my camera and no longer deal with cumbersome light stands and pocket wizards and extra set-up/tear-down time for all my lighting.  I am nimble and fast and able to get lighting (even in large rooms) that looks like I used a softbox (or 2 or 3).<br /><br />The best part?  The black foamie thing is the cheapest piece of equipment I've purchased (EVER) and it has made a tremendous difference (along with the knowledge of how to bounce the light).
B0094KORXI|5.0|One of the more popular Disney movies, on par with Aladdin, Lady and the Tramp, Cinderella, and Beauty and the Beast. 5 stars all the way around, 6 stars for the music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Truly unforgettable.  Haunting.  Now I'm itching to get to Mockingjay.  If it's even a shadow of this one, it will be one of the best series I've ever read.
B0088X7YU0|2.0|If I knew it was animated I would have not purchased, would have been a better movie if it wasn't animated,
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Like anything spread out over such a huge area of responsibility the forecasts are usually close enough to be helpful.
B00CATSONE|3.0|This overview of Tesla's work and struggles are geared to a middle school student.  There is as much about how to succeed in life - through creativity, imagination and hard work - as there is about Tesla's inventions and work ethic.<br />Although well written, I learned very little.  I think a school kid would be the best \\"audience\\" for this book.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|i really liked this story of a different breed of wolves  with a heart  and the girl who did not quite fit in until she did
B005PK57IK|5.0|Excellent Series! Great ensemble cast, I just wish series four was on prime as well. Sorry there will be no more seasons
B00CATSONE|5.0|Very nicely written. Its motivating, and engaging, difficult to put down.<br />It was a pleasure reading this book. Would definitively recommend it to<br />any one from any field ! Makes you sit up and think...
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This whole series has been a great ride and looking forward to the final books.  Of course you are left hanging on what happens next for the main characters and I hope that things start happening to resolve the many story lines he has going and it reaches a satisfying ending as well!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love the story line! Always eager to watch more. I am ready for the next season to become available. Six stars
B002AT4K9G|4.0|Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the Fast franchise.  I could enjoy Fast and the Furious for what it was.  2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races.  Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise.  There are many reasons for why this is.<br /><br />I find the characters to be much better this time around.  Vin Diesel's character, Toretto, is back with a vengeance.  Him being back, and his character arc in this is one of the main reasons I like this film more than the previous ones.  At the start of the film he leaves his gang because the police are gunning for him.  He then gets a call from his sister saying Letty (Michelle Rodriguez's character) has been killed.  Now Toretto is on a revenge mission to kill the person who killed Letty.  This makes it more of a personal story for the characters, especially Toretto, which I like.  I am also a fan of revenge stories, which made me enjoy this more.<br /><br />I like Paul Walker's character, Brian, more here than any of the previous films.  He seems more mature and professional here.  In this film he has been reinstated as an FBI agent.  I still do not really buy him as an FBI agent; he does come off as more professional and less of a punk in this movie.<br />Jordana Brewster, from the first film, comes back as Mia, who is Brian's love interest.  I thought she was fine, but she is not given much to do.  The other characters are not much.  Han Lu form Tokyo Drift returns here, as well as Letty.  However, they only show-up in the beginning and then disappear from the movie.  This story is really about Brian and Toretto.<br /><br />The villain is also very lazy.  The Fast films have never had strong villains, but I find this one particularly weak.  The villain in this movie along with the villain in the first film is probably my least favorite villains of these movies.<br /><br />The races are still fun to watch.  The races here are probablysome of my favorite of the franchise.  Although there is some very obvious CGI used in some of the races and car chases which might take you out.  There was CGI used in the previous films as well, but here it is particularly noticeable.  The CG did irk me, but it did not ruin the action.<br /><br />Overall, Fast and Furious is my second favorite Fast film so far.  I definitely like it more than the films before it.  I like the darker tone, as well as Vin Diesel and his character arc.  The races were also good despite the noticeable CGI.  For those who are fans of this franchise give this a look if you have not already.
B009CF3MEK|4.0|The story line is really typical of the author. But, the overall presentation is very worthwhile watching. It will be interesting to see how the new movie will compare.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Fast Five is without a doubt the best film is the Fast franchise.  I enjoyed the Fast and The Furious as a popcorn film.  I did not care for either 2 Fast 2 Furious or Tokyo Drift.  I thought Fast and Furious was a step up from the previous films.  However, Fast Five is on a whole other level.<br /><br />The story takes place right where Fast and Furious left off.  Brian O'Connor and his Mia break Toretto out of prison and are now labeled as wanted criminals.  In response a Special Forces team lead by Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) are sent to bring them in.  Toretto and Brian gather a team to pull of one final job, and then disappear for good.<br /><br />The characters are the best aspect about the film.  Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reprise their roles here.  I think they turn their best performances here.  Jordana Brewster returns as Mia.  She does a good job with what she is given.  The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) gives his best performance in a long time in this movie.  To me this is the Rock's return to action movies not Faster.<br /><br />All the other cast members from the previous films return here.  Tyrese Gibson comes back as Roman Pierce.  I did not care for Gibson in 2 Fast 2 Furious, but I do not mind him here as much.  This is probably because he is a supporting character in this film, and not a main character that has to carry the film.  Ludacris (Tej) and Sung Kang (Han) return as well.  I never cared about those characters but they did fine in this movie.  Gisele, played by Gal Gadot comes back too.  She had a small role in Fast and Furious that is not even worth noting.  However, I thought her character was awesome here.  The character of Vincent is back from the first movie as well.  I did not like his character at all in Fast and the Furious, and I did not care for him here either.  He is one of the only characters that I did not like in this film.  I loved seeing the cast of all the Fast films together.  The interacting they all have with each other is great and very fun.<br /><br />The villain, I will say is weak.  That should not be a surprise at this point.  The Fast films have always had weak villains.  Though, I will, say, this villain is one of the stronger villains of the franchise, though that is not saying much.<br /><br />The action is top-notch!  The action scenes trump anything in the other Fast films.  The action is different than the other films too.  It focuses less on races (though there are some) and more on fist fight, fire fights, car chases, etc.  This film is more of a heist movie than a racing movie.  The effects for the film are also top of the line, and better than all of the other movies.  The ending scene alone is worth seeing the movie for.<br /><br />Overall this is a must watch for all who are fans of this franchise.  This is easily the best Fast film in almost every category whether it is characters, story, action, effects, etc.
B00BK3MSME|5.0|I Like the old songs and Peyroux has the voice for them. Very blues great sound. Like to see more of her
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was quite surprised by the turn of events and blown away with the ending. I never imagined what was to come. I REALLY liked this book. I could relate with the father wanting to do whatever he had to defend his son, who is accused of murder. Being a prosecutor, he knew the ins and outs of the legal system and it was quite interesting. Legal thrillers are my absolute favorite and Defending Jacob is a good one. It was never boring and kept me wanting more until the end. Then I was just like WOW!
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|I finally got around to watching this because I needed something light to take my mind off other things.  This animated movie has the best animation detail I've yet seen and the plot was solid.  The horse was unrealistic, but very funny with a lot of dog characteristics.  Watched it twice through.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|This blueray is really incredible. I've already attended personally a Las Vegas show, and this bluray brings that environment to your room. It worth each dollar you pay for it.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I have a few external devices that require a FireWire connection and this Adapter keep everything going.<br />I have choices as to which connection used which device - excellent Apple quality.<br />A great little adapter.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Good funny film.  You always think you know what to expect, when you're expecting and this film did a great job showing exactly what it is like.  Sure some parts where a bit cheezy, but overall it was a good flick.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|this game has great graphics and flows very well. positives: fun,  all of the pictures you go into makes you feel like you are playing a variety of games. down side: cost and it was short. even so one of the better games out there.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love it its so cool its kinda teaches kids if they crush there groceries when their adults they wont have food when they get home!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The writing was superb, although the book really didn't pull me in until I was halfway done. After a major plot twist I couldn't stop reading. I am definitely expecting a sequel or continuation of the story but if there's not one the book ended the best way it could. Skill level of writing was the best. Definitely not a book that can be figured out easily.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|It was a birthday gift for a child she loved it. She watches it over & over again. Great present for small girls.
1451637500|5.0|Like everything by this author.  Excellent character development.  Hope this is not the last story or the last series.  More please.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|Loved this game at first but eh now but I still play when super bored but it's pretty good my 4 yr old likes it lol he is not very good on harder levels though
1439153663|5.0|Though some forget that there were others forced to work in the fields and for masters.  Quite a few Irish came over with the hope of a better life.  Yes they were white and could possibly get out, but that was after many years of toil.  Book Club read and was well received.
B009LDCZ7I|1.0|This review is ONLY about Season 2 and ONLY about the horrendous shipping nightmare I just now experienced (5 minutes ago). I stupidly purchased this DVD set from a site I found elsewhere online. I was drawn in by the facts that: 1) it was available NOW (already released), and 2) it was significantly cheaper. I got what I paid for, though. Upon arrival minutes ago I noticed that the package was from China, and upon opening it, I found that one of the corners of the box-set was smashed as if Dumbo himself had his way with it! Shame on me!! I regularly assert to others how fair and responsive Amazon is with any and all returns I've sent to them, but the ONE TIME I allowed myself to wander away from a vendor that has done nothing more than treat me like royalty, I get smacked with reality. The chances of me successfully returning the piece of trash I now hold in my hand is laughable. Stupid, stupid, stupid...me!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Can't play this CD enough. Love it!!!!!! He is the  best. Will look for more CDs and DVDs on Bocelli.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|The story drew me in immediately and held my interest throughout.  Christina McKenna's portrayal of Jamie brought forth emotions ranging from heart-rending to hilarious.  Recommended reading!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Having not heard much about this movie when it was in theaters, I decided to watch it after it did well at the Oscars.  The acting by the two main leads, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, is topnotch, and they bring a chemistry between them to the screen that I have not seen in a movie in a long time.  The secondary supporting actors also deliver, including Robert de Nero and Chris Tucker.  Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed!
B00821PCJS|4.0|Its a decent show on a network that ticks me off! I was very happy to find it available on amazon prime. I am not hooked yet as I am only on episode 6 but think I will continue to watch!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|This is a terrible game. The game will never load. Mine never did.<br />EVER! It was awful and it keeps deleting itself.Never buy the game.<br />My Kindle Fire isn't broken!
B00133KFGW|3.0|Schmaltzy, over-sentimental, and ridiculously far- fetched. Writing and direction felt like it was done by a 7 th grader. Really cheesy. Not a great use of my money.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Interesting Movie, I WaS not Expecting The End To Be That Way. A Must Watch! You Won't Be Disappointed At All!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|really liked this movie, it kept a five, six, and three year old quite engaged! I must admit that I also was hooked.
B0054SMID0|3.0|I like Matthew in this...slick lawyer who cruises around in his Lincoln...shot to look like the 70's I got tired of it after a while but worth a look.  It's free with PRIME!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had never purchased a Jillian Michaels workout before, so I was quite skeptical about this one. But recently I've been tipping the scales at 260lbs, and I was desperate. I knew Jillian was renowned for her ruthlessness, but I decided to try this workout anyway, and I'll admit, it is in NO WAY EASY but it kicks your but in the good way! The first time I did this workout I thought I was going to die! But after just three days of doing it, I have twice as much energy, and its already getting easier. For anyone who is at their ends wit, I say this is a good butt kicking way to wake you up. It tests your will, your strength, and you body, but I believe if you stick with it, it will get you back into a healthy happy shape!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Totally awesome show, I loved the first season I just hope it does not fall apart the next few seasons.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love  this book it's really quite slow at the beginning but then it speed  up- very well written amazingly well written I. Fact
B000683VI4|4.0|I have seen several sniggering references to this movie.  Probably by people who aren't comfortable with sentimental emotions.<br /><br />The story involves an elderly gentleman who visits a woman in a home, who drifts in and out of lucidity.  On these visits he reads to her from a Notebook. The man is unusually devoted to her and is ever solicitous.<br /><br />Through flashbacks we get the story of a young couple who struggle against her parents and class differences.<br /><br />Not until the ending do we get confirmation of what we suspected all along.  The ending is cheesy but what the hell it is a love story.
159562015X|4.0|We have had around 10 employees take the Strength Finder test. It is very informative and helpful. I would recommend it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|While Temple of Doom is not the best, the other three are really good.  Highly recommended for a viewing experience you will enjoy for a long time to come.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|The movie had a suspenseful story but at times it was not clearly depicted. The actors were all very good and the scenery was beautiful.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Although some times predictable, there are enough surprises to keep me guessing and happy. I enjoy the interpersonal relationships involving all of regular characters. And, if I can be forgiven, I find Castle and Beckett together adorable and heated at the same time, reminiscent of Moonlighting's David and Maddie. None of the chemistry is lost as they move to openly recognize and &#34;formalize&#34; their relationship; I'm happy Castle got &#34;The Question&#34; out in the Season 5 finale.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great movie full of quirky characters and good story telling. Solid acting and funny approach to heavy subjects. So good I'd gladly watch it again
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I don't understand why there has to be such an emphasis on homosexual choices in tv shows. Less than 4% of the population live that way, but from tv, you'd think it was over half! Ridiculous!  Great cinematography / costuming / furnishings. Love everything else about the show. Just wish they'd skip shoving a radical agenda on us again.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Remakes usually don't make the cut but this movie was so funny. I rented it and loved it and so did the family.
0385535147|2.0|What can be said about Grisham? What can't be said? What won't we say? Man, after reading \\"The Racketeer,\\" sometimes I'm glad that there isn't the person who asks, \\"Gee, tell me how you REALLY feel!\\" Yeah...how I REALLY feel, huh? Well, I feel as if Grisham could've been a lot more solid in this one. Maybe he should've taken the high road, and left his Author's Note alone as well, because that didn't make this one a whole lot better. \\"The Racketeer\\" talked about a good story in the insert, and was a lot of racket, with some memorable moments in between.<br /><br />Malcolm Bannister is in jail, and he's ready to make his big move. A judge has been murdered, and he knows what's gone down, and how it has gone down. He's a black lawyer, which may or may not speak volumes, but it keeps his brain going that much more. Within the story he knows, all hell is about to break loose, and he really doesn't care!<br /><br />(unfortunately, that was about when THIS READER started NOT TO CARE, but kept reading anyway...ok, break's over, continue reading review, please)<br /><br />Would you be surprised if what followed was drugs, money, sex, and a safe? Yep, if that was your guess, then you win! But it really isn't that easy, either. There is chaos, there is disorder, and our hero moves as fast as he can, while keeping the reader falling asleep in certain spots at a snail's pace. But some of the complexity keeps a sharp mind, and Malcolm Bannister gets his day, and ultimately gets his gold!<br /><br />While you may deem this verdict as rather unfair, allow me to quote the opening 2 lines in Grisham's Author's Note. \\"This is indeed a work of fiction, and more so than usual. Almost nothing in the previous 340-odd pages is based on reality.\\" Wow, hmmmm...you don't say, Johnny-boy?!!? Because let me tell you something, it didn't FEEL all that real either. It felt pushed out, like a crap that needs to be released with some major medication! Ultimately, what can you say? Grisham is the best, and Grisham is sometimes his own worst enemy. That Author's Note? I didn't need to be reading that! Because the fire he lit for \\"The Racketeer\\" was barely boiling in the first place, and adding soaking wet firewood to it didn't help a whole lot.<br /><br />But I'll still be back for more, because even the best screw up every once in a great while. Guess that time was this time, once again, for Grisham. I'm just glad that he's good, more often than not!est, and Grisham is sometimes his own worst enemy. That Author's Note? I didn't need to be reading that! Because the fire he lit for \\"The Racketeer\\" was barely boiling in the first place, and adding soaking wet firewood to it didn't help a whole lot.<br /><br />But I'll still be back for more, because even the best screw up every once in a great while.

B0098VXBIA|1.0|Didn't care too much for this movie but it was a cheap rental so I don't really feel I wasted my money. Would not recommend unless you absolutely cannot find anything better to watch.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Yes, the title of my review is cheesy, but the book it is on is anything but cheesy.  Like many other reviewers, I heard about the book because of the movie.  I am a huge fan of JLaw and was really wanting to see the movie (sadly I haven't yet) but I have seen some clips and was really interested.  Later, I talked to a girl at my university about the movie and she told me her high school Spanish teacher was the uncle of the books author.  I did not know it was originally a book so my interest in the story peaked.  I waited for the price to go down, even begging my friend to let me barrow her copy, and finally Amazon Kindle had it drop in price and I jumped at the chance.  I was unsure of what I was going into, but soon I was hooked.  I began to read it through all my classes (a main reason I struggled on future homework assignments) and it was worth it.  The characters of Pat and Tiffany are deep and troubled, but they mirror everyone, even the people who are not diagnosed with mental disabilities.  The characters are real and deep, and you can't help but love them for everything they are.  The story moves quickly and does not drag.  I am not a huge fan of cursing (I am a Christian) but it did not bother me in this book.  It was used well and really helped understand the pain of the characters.  When the ending came (no I will not spoil it) I was surprised because I was really wanting it to go on forever.  After the withdrawal, I told everyone to read the book because it was just that amazing!  It is by far one of the best books I have every read and I read a lot (I am a Literature Major).  Buy the book, see the movie (after I do) and enjoy the brilliance of finding Silver Linings!
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Not as good as the first book but that is to be expected I think. Great read even if it is for teens.
B001AVCFJM|4.0|So I have never seen the tv show or any of the movies, but a kid from my high school told me to watch it and I did.  Wow, star trek is really good, clean, and yes sexy at times which is not what I expected.  The two disc is great because I love bonus features.  Sadly, it does not play on my laptop, but over all, it was worth it
B000UYJR7I|1.0|This is one messed up movie. It was cheap rental and I've liked Christina Ricci in other movies but this movie is awful.
B000FA675C|4.0|I liked the book and it got me hooked on Robert Langdon novels.<br />I am a Christian and do not agree with the subject matter which is full of holes and issues, but the book is good and really weaves a nice plot.  Read it, but read Angels and Demons first because it really is the first in the series.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I bought this chord thinking I could plug my Kindle to my computer and allow it to charge instead of having to use an electrical outlet. This isn't the case. This chord is only to be used to transfer files from you Kindle to your computer or vice versa I guess. It did not charge my Kindle through my computer.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Reviewed by Amanda Jane Volovik \\"Chava\\": I figured this movie out in the first fifteen minutes, I was surprised how accurate I was. It was sappy in areas, and the premise was a bit boring too with how the child characters came to be with the couple in the movie. I gave an extra star for how the children walked when they were discovered or when they walked to their 'ghostly watcher', that was scary. The creature was creepy looking but too obviously computer animated which took the scare away for me. Can't rate movies highly I can figure out in fifteen minutes.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great story, great acting, great directing and a very happy ending.  What more could you want in a movie.  Loved it!
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|Jeffrey Archer as usual tells a very good yarn. Although enjoyable I feel that it was very similar to his previous books of  Kane &Abel and As the Crow Flies.
B006H5120E|5.0|I got this for my wife she loves this movie and to get it in 3D now she can love it more and enjoy it with her mom and sister.
B000V6Q7SM|5.0|Not sure it's the absolute best version; but it is very, very good. This is a magnificent piece of music. You will feel like cheering and crying at the same time.
B005GSY23M|5.0|Listen to at night in the dark with some friends and some good bourbon on a rooftop deck in spring.
B00AEFXL5W|5.0|I love her style, her movies, she's an icon by definition, and this is THE MOVIE to watch and collect. Audrey will live forever is our hearts and guide us through the hard path of fashion....
B00CL6GAD2|4.0|Would have paid to see at the theater but worth the rental at home on the couch with some popcorn.
B007FH9GA6|4.0|The cat could have been just left alone, that was depressing. I like the acting though and the story is awesome. RIP Steig.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|What can I say?  I was in England as a young boy when this series started and it was what we talked about at school.  Through the years it lost some of it's original luster mostly due to poor production techniques but the relaunch has brought back all the wonder and awe of the originals.  Season 5 brings back the quikyness of doctor, the perspective of a sane human, the companion, and the thrill ride of the two doing the impossible. Movie quality on TV.  Outstanding!
1451613512|2.0|Although the book contains a lot of facts, every opinion is skewed to show the US or Capitalism in the worst light. I guess it was written for people who already agreed with the progressive point of view. Almost laughable when it claims that Lenin killed so many of his people because he was surrounded by the Capitalist. The analysis of Truman as a wimp who had to prove he was tough by dropping the atomic bombs on Japan was interesting but fairly skewed to show that we didn't need to do it since Japan would have caved when Russia entered the war. Also, the authors put a lot of weight on the back channel surrender offers coming out of Japan, claiming that if the Emperor and their form of government was left intact they would have surrendered without the bomb. Since much has been written on the Japanese refusal to surrender incurring major losses on the islands leading up the conclusion of the war, it is an exercise in wishful thinking to write that the alternative to the bomb held more weight.  The book did take a turn at the end when the authors rip Obama for his pursuit and continuation of Bush polices in Iraq and Afghanistan, particularly the use of drones. I also found it interesting on the treatment of Gates as a neocon, whose book gave Ford a major well done for his human rights initiatives that ate the Soviet block from the inside and allowed Regan to reside at their funeral. I disagree with the weight put on Ford and discounted Reagan's contribution to their decline.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|the book explains why the regime is beneficial, it gives several ways to incorporate the diet into everyday life, there are good menus and calorie counter
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great book and a fine ending to the series.  Sanderson has done a terrific job finishing the series for Robert Jordan.
1442359315|5.0|I had read his book and wanted to share it with my sister who is very unwell, scarred of death and blind. Having the talking book version was perfect to share with her. Not only was the content uplifting but Eben Alexander's voice was perfectly appropriate.
125000098X|4.0|I could not wait for the third book to come, I pre-ordered it.  It is really good for the most part but not quite as exciting as the first 2 in the series.  If you read the first 2 you must finish reading the story.
1932100660|5.0|O M G---What a revelation to ultimate heath issues--studies envolving the whole world and how they eat and live---A must know for all who are concerned with there health and who believe they're health depends on how they eat.  In the end we are what we eat for the most part, and the cruelty that happens that end up on our plates, will move most who read this book.  This book is not about opinions.  This book presents facts that should never be ignored, and makes the reader feel more responsible with each fact presented.
B000WKY9JQ|5.0|one of these most prized album from the game. this is awesome. every singo track is good i highly recommended
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|If yu have not seen this movie--Please see it. It is a light romantic feel, with the comedy that made me ache with laughter!!  All Dustin Hoffman fans should own it.  I had it in cassette, and had to  upgrade. The cast was perfect!! I highly reccommend it to all who like to laugh.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I liked the dialogue of the book. I wanted to find out how it would end. Now I will always wonder, even though I've made up my own ending.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This movie was adventurous, warm, full of feeling, and conscience.A good storyworth seeing, full of wonderful color and artistic filming. Excellent Xmas movie!

B00000IQV7|5.0|Had to own this one.  It was a great feel movie. This wonderful man helped so many in need. It was a serious subject with laughter and romance. The laughter did not take away from the subject, and its inspiration. Perfect casting.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|This book was very accurate and well written.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for an adventurous story.
B001I0T92Q|4.0|I've bought two of these recently, one for my own use and one for a relative.  Paired with two Class 4 16GB MicroSDHC chips, this card gives a PSP circa 30GB of available memory after formatting at about half the cost of a Sony card with similar storage capacity.  I have only two complaints - one, the MicroSDHC chips are -not- swappable once installed, so you'll need separate adapter cards if you want to use more of them than the two this card supports; I don't want to potentially ruin my card trying it out, but you could probably superglue the chips in to make sure you don't remove them accidentally.  Two, the card itself feels like it's made from cheap plastic, and probably won't last under heavy handling.  This isn't a problem if you only swap cards once in a blue moon - 30GB holds a lot of game data and quite a few games on its own - but heavy swappers may have trouble on this front eventually.  I would certainly recommend this to someone looking for more storage on their PSP.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 year old loves this app. It is perfect for down time and travel. Totally worth the $1.99 upgrade and the animal version is even better!
B00AFEY354|5.0|This was my favorite movie of the year! it captured the book so well and shows a great representation of High School, graduation, and shows Charlie's decline perfectly. The cast was great and the direction flawless. Such a good movie and the dvd had the BEST deleted scenes.
193700788X|1.0|Only explanation for this utterly poorly written work is that it was ghost written by someone else who hadn't read the series.  While it is a writer's perogrative to write what they want, however unpopular it may be to a rabid fanbase, it is their job to take us there, and make us understand their choices.  This was not even remotely done here.  The only thing this final book accomplished was clearing out my bookshelf of well worn books I'll never read again, and cross an author off my list.  
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I read the books and saw the show and fell in love with them both! Its the best, dramatic, epic, and thought provoking show on television! The second season does not disappoint and it has some great stuff. Episode 9 of this season blew me away with its special effects and its acting!
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|hey just to start i think Mark Wahlberg is a very under rated actor. i havn't seen many where his prescence has not dominated the screen!!! he has a certain charisma about him, the walk, the talk, the mannerism's. his intensity is immence. you can get drawn in to his character, very easily.he evenly transitions to the comedy character, in any role he may take on. i havn't seen Ted yet, but i will!!! i can assure you!!! i am thoroughly pleased with this movie. and yea!!  don't think the scenario can't happen in the real world!! this movie!!  Thanks  Tim
0811879542|5.0|It is so funny that I actually find myself tipping, tapping and shaking the book before I turn the page, as though it is truly necessary to do so. Purchased for my 2 year-old grandson. He enjoys it very much.

B00395ZYVS|4.0|The book is good , every body who is adopted or is planing to adopt , even if you are planning to give your baby on adoption should read this book.
B000HF4TIM|5.0|Haven't seen this movie in years and when I saw it for sale I just had to have it. I love this movie and the picture quality is fantastic.
B001XULSG6|5.0|For Trekkie fans the name Borg doesn't bring up a Swedish company but a soulless enemy with no fear off death  or anyone.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|Watched this last night and couldn't move again through the whole movie. Forgot just how good a movie this was. The quality is fantastic and I am looking forward to watching it again in the near future.
B00AI0YYCM|5.0|I buy them and give them to friends.  There is a chapter that has intense significance to me so I share it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It's solid. It does the book justice. I enjoyed most the actors. Jennifer Lawrence was great. The young actor that plays peeta was not what I imagined. I imagined someone much larger.
193700788X|2.0|*NO SPOILERS*<br />Oh, \\"Dead Ever After\\", why do you disappoint?? I think it's safe to say that the series has been slowly dwindling since probably \\"Dead and Gone\\". However, Sookie's adventures had still been fun and engaging. I desperately wanted Harris to turn this streak around with her final book and end on a high note, but I was sadly disappointed.<br />First off, the obvious: Sookie's choice of man by the end of the book. This came completely out of left field. I wouldn't have minded the decision so much if Harris had built upon their relationship throughout the course of the other books. But, there had been absolutely no chemistry between Sookie and Fill-in-the-Blank at all in the series, so their newfound love seemed very uncomfortable and dissatisfying.<br />Also frustrating; the complete lack of an epic plot. This is the final book in a series about vampires, werewolves, shape shifters, witches, fairies, and all other kinds of supernatural creatures; you would expect an epic, bloody conclusion filled with battles, bloodshed, death, and heroism. However, this book was surprisingly light in the action department. I wasn't expecting a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" Battle for Middle-Earth, but SOMETHING would have been nice.<br />Also, it seems like Harris is getting caught up in all of the supernatural restrictions she's placed on all of her characters. This final book seemed to break many of the magical laws set down in previous books, with Sookie hastily explaining some bogus loophole (i.e. the portal of Faery, who her telepathic ability works on, the spells cast by witches, vampire politics, etc.).<br />If you are a longtime fan of the series, then of course, read the book and make your own judgements, but be prepared for disappointment.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Stunning, a great book. I loved reading it and told all my friends about it.<br />A book we should all read.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Compared to the iPAD version, this app is very limited in functionality.  Very depressing and not overly intuitive user interface.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|Even though this is not the original Footloose movie, it is a pretty good remake. it is worth watching, which at first I was hesitant to watch since I grew up watching the original in the theatre.

B00BGIBVP8|4.0|This movie is good, not the best, but definitely not horrible either. Some parts made me laugh uncontrollably, while other parts of the film I wish would just be over. They are one happy (and severely messed up) family, that needs to punish the daughter a bit more.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|OK, it's been two days since I actually paid to watch a movie.  UNreal for me!  I'm that poor - I wait until they are on Netflix for that flat rate fee of $7.99.  I'm not cheap, I'm just a woman of very few means.  For now.  Maybe forever since I am elderly now.  Sigh, how low have we fallen.  ANYWAY .... I'm trying so hard to remember the ending but I cannot!  If what I remember is correct, then I was not terribly impressed.  The movie itself though - from the beginning to almost the very end, was good!  Good acting, sets, dialogue, the works!  I liked ALL that and then some -- the special effects of how Mama looked were really different! But that, too, could've used a bit more imagination about 'beauty' and 'ugly by self-hatred' ... anyway, save your $5 and wait for it to be on Netflix! LOL  I STILL give it a four because I DID like it but if I had a do-over?  I would wait.  YOU decide now!  :-)
0470474874|5.0|This is a great resource for getting the job done. I have learned a lot in a short amount of time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO AMAZING, BUT THE UPDATES TAKE A WHILE TO COME OUT. YOU CAN PLAY HUNGER GAMES WITH YOUR FREINDS AND ALSO DO OTHER STUFF. SOON THERE WILL BE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER :) SO HAPPY FOR THAT. THE VERSION 0.7.0 HAS NOW BEEN SUBMITTED IN<br />THE APP STORE. SOOOOOOOO EXSITED. LUV THIS GAME. SO WORTH IT.
B00127RAJY|4.0|If you commit, you will see results! Kind of hard to commit to it completely with my busy schedule, but 5 days a week for me at least and I'm seeing results!
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|good choice; I cut electrical consumption in half. I recommend it for everyone it is time to change all Light bulbs to LED.
B004SDEP38|3.0|Same as I said with Easy print..... it is much easier to just type up a document on a laptop and hit the print key and presto you have your document...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I will admit to being totally confused a the end and had to go back and figure a few things out!  I liked that!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I had been waiting for a new Vorkosigan book. I don't care for her fantasies that much. Lois just needs to accept that Vorkosigan's world is her life's work! : ) Loved it. Ivan gets dumped on so often, it was nice to see the world from his perspective.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|very addicting...play it all the time in the evening instead of watching the television---husband hates it because i sometime ignore him until i finish a game
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game is the first game I have ever thought worthy enough to buy. It's challenging enough to not be mind numbing but not so difficult that I find it hard to pick up again. A nice way to pass the time.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoyed everything from the pace, acting, and story lines to the characters themselves. Can't wait to start season 2.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Super good!can't stop 're-reading over and over!!!! :) can't wait to see the movie!! Might be better than the book!! Jk lol
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I like having the ability to view the data for my business page separate from my personal page. Worth the infrequent glitches.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I really like the intensity of this show. It's not overly intense but has good drama and action. It's the best &#34;super hero&#34; show I've seen on TV.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Well written, good story lines. I used to watch an occasional show as it aired and thought each one was a good criminal story, but wasn't until I watched the series from the beginning that I realized what I was missing!
B0014FATTC|5.0|I liked the book because of the plot, I gave it the rating because of the plot. I would recommend this book to anyone in 5th grade and above because it is confusing but eventful.
0393327345|4.0|Fight Club can be categorized as a couple different genres such as mystery/drama or even thriller, and such diversity makes this story much more appealing to a wider range of audience. Those who love reading twisted story plots will really enjoy this read as they get sucked into this roller coaster ride. As soon as you read just the first page, the foreshadow of the narrator standing atop of a building that's about to collapse will surely grab the reader's attention as this scene is actually a glimpse of what happens much later on. The fact that the protagonist is the narrator, who remains nameless mostly throughout the book, just adds that mysterious touch, as well as the suspense and thrilling scenes scattered throughout the plot. Although I really could have done without the use of such vulgar language and really awkward scenes, it is what the author intended in the end. Sometimes it just seems as if the he only sprinkles in such language to really just attract the reader's attention; but for many, as myself, it just makes you want to put the book down. This story focuses on themes of chaos/societal breakdown, isolation, emasculation, and existentialism.  The author's prominent use of literary devices such as repetition and flashbacks really categorize this book as a cliffhanger. I would recommend this book to someone who is really interested in suspense and enigmas, as there are many secrets and questions to crack in order to delve into the mind of the complex characters.
0385737955|5.0|This series was solo great I re-read it!! The second and third books were my total favorite!! If you like book about the end of times then this book is for YOU!!!! I've never written a book review, but this series had my attention!!!!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Good for both kids and adults, has some fun video-game era sound bites and humor.  This is definitely a worthwhile rental.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I read a lot about the difference in charging speeds is etc. - honestly none of that is so huge as to make a difference in the real world but the way this just attaches with no wear and tear on the micro USB port is fantastic. This should be the cable that's sold with the Nexus 10 by default.  If you have a Nexus 10 just get the Pogo cable - its the best way to charge by far.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This is a nice app but the action is a bit slow.  However, the sound quality is not bad at all.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The books theme was top rate, It tells of the real world that we live in. DeMille has a tendency to slow down novels with too much talking about one subject at times, In all the novel was good, I would recommend it.
193700788X|1.0|I normally do not write reviews but Wow! I can't even finish this book! I have been very excited & waited patiently to see how the series would end & boy am I extremely disappointed!!!  The characters that we know and have come to love have been unjustly executed in my opinion. It seems as if the series didn't end or live on happily dead after or hereafter but rather maybe that we might be blindly being led down the path to a new series focused on Eric since he hardly appeared in the book at all?<br /><br />This book really didn't seem like it was written by Charlaine Harris but a ghost writer. Where's the passion, humor, and fire? To end the series in this matter just upsets me that I invested my time in reading about Sookie and her pals for 13 books. (I could go on but I don't want to spoil it for other readers whom I'm sure will be disappointed as well.). There's always HBO's True Blood so hopefully I will find my happy ending there.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I love musicals but this was just okay.  Too long, melodramatic, and very surprising that Anne Hathaway won for Best Supporting Actress.  She's only in the movie for about 10 minutes.  Hugh Jackman carries the movie.  Definitely not something I'd buy for my video library.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I already saw the first movie but when I heard a second movie was coming out this fall I decided to buy the trilogy so I could refresh on the first book and read the 2nd book before the movie came out.<br />I enjoyed the first book, and only a little different than the movie, but packed with more details.  Just finished the second book.  I enjoyed it even more than the first.  The writer develops the characters in this book.<br />Now I'm reading the 3rd book, but wondering if I should wait until I see the 2nd movie.  After all it's the final chapter of the trilogy and it's like reading the last page before you read the book.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This feels like the most emotionally wrenching film experience of my life, and I mean that in a very good way. I've never been so totally absorbed in the emotions of the characters on a screen, for pretty much the entire duration of the film. Again and again I'd find a lump in my throat, breath caught short, teary-eyed. The trailer description nails it: \\"Both epic and intimate, devastating and uplifting...\\". Yeah, all that and more. Put me through a wringer and I can't wait to do it again. It feels so good to really feel something, not just observe spectacle and tragedy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this book a 5 star review because it was such an amazing book. I loved everything about this book. I would suggest this book to people who like action, suspense, romance, and sadness.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good graphics. keeps you thinking, and is a good way to stimulate the brain. The only drawback to it are the popups, but for free is still a great game that I can recommend to anyone.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|It has been an engrossing read. What I find best is the knowledge of religion, ecology, and wisdom of animals as measured by mans ignorance. The conclusion reminds me of Kurt Vonegut's FOMA: a grey lie which makes you whole, true and brave. Belief is what binds us together. I did not find God as was promised in the introduction. A good story and asking for a revaluation would be more than is expected.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|All the elements you want in an action movie. Fast cars, lots of guns and shooting, silly moments, things blowing up and of course, as always, the final battle is the good guy and the bad guy in a fist fight. LOL<br />Every bit of this movie is stereotypical action movie, but heck, it works, and it's entertaining. Maybe a slightly more interesting story or good characters would make me watch it again. All in all it's pretty shallow and one dimensional, but since I had a good time watching it, 4 stars are deserved. And is always good to see Arni back in action.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Story was strong on the effects of alcohol and struggle to admit it. Great action scenes. Well played by all actors
B00BXHE0CI|5.0|Been listening since calculating infinity...<br /><br />They still kill it!<br /><br />They sort of hit me in a way Converge does...<br /><br />It's metal/hardcore, just kinda different<br /><br />Not for everyone, but solid as hell<br /><br />I dare you to go to a live show!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like it, probably because it is a good game. . . . . but. . . . it does load pretty S L O O O O O O O W W W. But overall it is a REALLY good game.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game I could play this game forever I love it love it love it is so  awesome!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so creative I mean who thinks of a little man in a jet pack. I totally recommend this game.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game is a blast and very additive!  Once you start playing you not only want to compete with everyone else, but your own scores as well.
1400032717|3.0|When I found out about the premise of this book, I thought that the author was onto something. I have a daughter that is part of the autism spectrum, on the very mild end, and my wife works in a school with autistic children, so I have been exposed to many of the characteristics associated with the disorder. The story we read is told by an autistic teenager, Christopher, who is investigating the murder of a dog. At the beginning, it is really interesting to see how Christoper thinks and processes outside stimuli. I found many parallelisms with behaviors I have seen in the real world and several of these are truly endearing.<br /><br />Some of the problems with the book start to appear when towards the middle point the \\"mystery\\" has already been solved and the mood of the story changes completely. Also, I think the author starts overdoing it with some of the narration. The repetitive patterns get old and the fact that it turns a little like a soap-opera diminished my enjoyment of the story. Also, the mood gets darker in terms of how the members of the family react to Christopher and also, the author pushes the boundaries of plausibility with some of the actions Christopher takes.<br /><br />The notes and appendix are interesting, especially in what has to do with the math abilities that Christopher possesses. It's a shame that the author missed the mark in some of the definitions he used, for example, how to find prime numbers. Christopher being as good as he is in math would never have defined it that way.<br /><br />In summary, the book contains a really original idea that could have been executed much better than it actually was.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game really hits the spot when you wanna your eyes and brain awake. Like I said addictive but fun.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Above average writing consistent beyond the pilot.<br />Actors who deliver the intent of the writers.<br />I'm as far as Series 2 and they are still going strong.
B00BNXOMHA|1.0|You can buy each movie separately with individual cases for almost half this price. Still on blue ray. Its about 70 bucks individually. I love having complete box sets, but when its 50 dollars more for all the same movies to just come in one Case VS 5 not worth it at all. Dont waste your money because the industry makes you think you'll be happier with 1 case VS 5 cases.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you can build nether reakters.And diamond sords and armorial like a diamond chest plate and all of that.But you cant build wood armed.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Lana Del Rey is not for everyone. I think she has a great and interesting style to her music, her voice is unique. I'd say her album reminds me of some kind of vintage bluesy stuff. That being said, she drawls, she keeps it low and mellow so if you're not into that ..you might want to check something else out.<br /><br />I love this album, the extra tracks as well, definitely worth the buy.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved this book. As a gamer and computer scientist it was right down my alley. If you like sci-fi, the 80's, video games, or hacking, you'll love this.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|this movie i love it it a very great movie he plays the movie great i have watch it over and over for servals days then my bother took it and watch it over and over now i have it back watch it tweice again i love the movie
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved the entire downtown abbey series ! It has everything you want :humor, romance,drama, and mystery. The witty &#34; grandmama&#34; is hilarious. I hope the writers make a season 4.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I uninstalled as soon as I opened it. If you are a gamer you may like it. I am not a gamer.
0385344228|1.0|For one, the grand jury transcripts were tedious, the narrative mind-boggling, and the should-be short story a real snooze. Dell hyped this to get Hollywood's attention but forget us, the buyers and readers. Twists? turns? Surprise ending? None of the above. You knew what was coming from the beginning, and the twists were just you practicing throwing it in the garbage. AND, I have never seen such malarky in the self-serving section after the book: I felt like I was being lectured about how to interpret and understand the story, then was about to puke when he told us through Q & A how he was so above us all as a writer. What chutzpah!
B004UNX1LS|2.0|I got this app because I like videos on YouTube but I can't watch them on my kindle. Doesn't vevo usually show music videos? I couldn't find a music video for my favorite song. Deleted after 2 minutes. Plus the title says VEVO-Watch free music videos. I might give it another try,based on other reviews. Make sure you listen to reviews!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|My husband and I can't get enough of this brilliant legal drama.  The way the characters' backstories unfold is genius and the show is well paced.  Each season is better than the last!
B00008972S|5.0|I got the DVD in a quick fashion and the price was so inexpensive.  I will definitely use them again if looking for an out of date movie.
B00AEFYWJG|5.0|Its one of my favorite movies!! I love Richard Gere and Edward Norton! They both are awesome in this movie!!
B007DIQC90|5.0|I first heard this band on siruis xm and was amazed, the album is great to listen to while driving.
0425252868|5.0|My father was a B-17 pilot in WWII, so I found this book of particular interest. I was engaged from the beginning as Franz Stigler and Charlie Brown's war lives were revealed. I learned new things about being a B-17 pilot, as my own father said very little. Charlie's harrowing flight from Bremen kept me glued to the book. I had no idea whether a plane as damaged as his could make it any further. And the later scene in the book of the bombing of the Munich airport was stunning, as my father participated in that very mission. It was eye opening to see the bombing run from the point of view of those on the ground, something I'd never thought much about.<br /><br />If you enjoy stories of World War II, or detailed descriptions of men enduring and sometimes surviving war, you will love this.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Seriously, before you read my review you must understand that I have been reading this series since it came out.  I met Robert Jordan before he died and really liked his writing style.  I had high hopes for Sanderson, but small mistakes in his writing in the Wheel series annoyed me to no ends.  Little things like the pet names that Min started using for Rand such as \\"looby\\" instead of \\"woolhead\\" or \\"Sheep herder\\" really distracted me from the story.  Loial went from a scholar with a child like enthusiasm for learning, to something I could not relate to.<br /><br />This final book got me really mad as he started killing off characters.  Why?  And couldn't he spend one chapter tying up loose ends? Poor thing to use Shara as where Demandred has been hiding.  Jordan said Shara wouldn't play a part, now it's pretty central!<br /><br />There are nuggets of gold hidden in the book, I loved the rescue of the Dragons by the band at the beginning, and a few characters NEEDED to die - so that was nice.<br /><br />Maybe I am just upset the series is at an end?  As Jordan would say, \\"Read and find out\\".
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing my cousins love it every time they come to my house thyself Malays ask to play
B00B2DSK06|4.0|I've watched it three times.  Kids love it.  Works great on the kindle fire.  Soundtrack is a blast.  Recommended to all.
0525478817|5.0|This book is a quick read and quite enjoyable. I laughed out loud at certain descriptions and dialogue and very much enjoyed the story as a whole.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I would have liked extended features, but it's a great movie and works on the Kindle fire without issues.  Recommended for all.
1439156816|5.0|This is the first, and only book by Mr. King that I have read. I now plan on reading his other work, and look forward to reading the work of his sons.<br /><br />As an aspiring writer, I couldn't have started with a better overview of the writing life. I'm sure that I'll regret writing that last sentence since it will only increase the number of competitors entering the field.<br /><br />If you decide to buy this book, I don't think you'll regret a single page.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|OK, I like the movie.  It doesn't feel as long as it is.  But this bonus feature was blah as you can watch it all on youtube.  Wait for Christmas and get the extended feature.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great acting, great stories.  Really enjoyed both season one and 2.  Look forward to more from Benedict Cumberbatch, he is so much fun to watch!!!!
B002PMPTIO|4.0|OK, I'm a Star Wars guy, but I like the direction they are going with this new Star Trek.  Too bad it'll only be movies as they have too many &#34;big names&#34; starring in it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|A very complicated read with all of the characters and shifts in plot. Never disappointing and well worth the effort to follow though. You find yourself cheering on some and hoping for disaster for others, some will even find redemption in your eyes. Looking forward to what will come now.
B00785P2QC|1.0|Very hard to understand.  Took up alot of space on kindle fire and removed the game very quickly.  I do not recommend it.
B001DF68MA|5.0|My 13 month old girl loves it.  she looks absolutely adorable in her Lazer BOB Flower Infant Helmet and is able to sleep just fine while we ride when she gets tired (just prior to bedtime, always asleep after 35 minutes).  The most surprising thing to me about this seat is the fact that she rarely hangs on to anything while were riding.  Even when she falls asleep with her little head laying on the padded front support top(???) her hands are always hanging down at her side.  I usually put her hands on that &#34;padded support top&#34; but she rarely keeps them there.<br /><br />Wonderful product.  So glad we bought it!!!!!<br /><br />I also am very pleased with the above mentioned helmet.  I would not recomend a helmet with a visor with this bike seat.  She was not able to lay her head down comfortably when she fell asleep when she wore a helmet with a visor.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I saw that the movie coming out was based on the best selling book. I thought I would give it a try. I read the first book in a day and read the rest of the available series that same week. It is a interesting story line that leaves you wanting more.
193700788X|1.0|Let me start by saying that my disappointment with this book has nothing to do with who Sookie ended up with. The problem with this book is that it felt like it was written by someone other than Charlaine Harris. The storyline was convoluted and had too many flaws to count. Sookie and just about everyone else acted completely out of character. Here is a short list of my issues:<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />1) The 3rd person POV added little if anything to the story and made the whole book feel disjointed. It felt like cheating to introduce this in the last book of the series. The villains' reasons for coming after Sookie were so weak, these chapters seem like they were inserted to try to make their motivation to kill Sookie more believable, but it didn't work.<br /><br />2) \\"A Devil\\", really... This character was totally unnecessary, but again seems to have been added to give the villains stronger motivation, but the reasons just weren't there. The character of the devil had no development. Also, why would Carmichael use his second wish to try to get the cluviel dor, which would only give him another wish? A wish for a wish? Why doesn't he just ask the devil for the same thing he would use the cluviel dor for? Another weak plot device...<br /><br />3) What is the deal with the garden growing out of control? I kept waiting for this to have some significance or meaning, but nothing. It was mentioned so often I knew there must be a point, but there wasn't, unless it was to deliver Niall's letter in the end. Maybe there was a point, but it was abandon, as so many other things were in this book.<br /><br />4) Sookie ends up with Sam. Why? There is no development of a relationship between them. They have always just been friends, other than a brief interaction in Sam's office in DAAD. That was 7 books ago! The cluviel dor is given as a reason, kind of, but not really...<br /><br />5) If you create a universe, you have to keep with its rules to make the story coherent and consistent. If you break those rules, it should be for a good reason that is written in a way that makes sense. Suddenly in the last book, Sookie can't hear Sam's thoughts?!?! She could hear Sam's complete sentences in the past.  She could hear Alcide.  Heck, she even heard Eric sometimes!  But to cheat the ending, suddenly Sookie cannot hear Sam.<br /><br />6) Poor, poor Eric... how did this character end up sold into slavery to OK? Eric consistently took a bullet for Sookie, both literally and figuratively. They fought together for their future, planned the attack against Victor together and even Bill said they had the same zeal for life. You can't just end that in a couple pages without it feeling like you've been gobsmacked.  In DAG Eric promised Sookie that he would never turn her, because she didn't want that. Even though he said he would hate to lose her, he still promised he would never do it. Suddenly in this book, it was his plan all along? Whaaat? Another cop out to try to make this book make some kind of sense...<br /><br />7) Would the real Sookie Stackhouse please stand up? Throughout this book, I really don't even like Sookie anymore. She seems to have become small minded and slightly bigoted.  After all the foreshadowing for her character, it is hard to accept she is just going to settle down to a normal life with her annuity and marry Sam... What happened to ideas like Mr. Catalides, \\"Humans who are born with the essential spark are born to experience or perform something wonderful, something amazing?\\" Or someone pointing out that Dermot treats Sookie \\"...like a queen\\", or Eric's speech in DTTW \\"When this witch is defeated, I would bring you to my side. I will share everything I have with you. Every vampire who owes me fealty will honor you.\\" Instead we end up with Sookie being financially stable, with the \\"safe\\" choice and living out your basic small town girl life free of vampires. What was it all for?<br /><br />The only saving grace is that this story seems so out of place, so not in the style of Harris, and so completely unlikely given the last 12 books, it is easily forgotten. I read my copy in one day, and promptly returned it. So sad, I was expecting something better for our Sook... If you choose to read this book, afterward check out [...] Helps to take the bad taste out of your mouth...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read anything by Stephen King in awhile and didn't know if I would like this one, but he is back!! Great characters, and a very imaginative plot. LOVED IT!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Thanks so much it helps me out alot it tells me my battery not very hard to put up<br />With . Also you can change colors . Get its for FREE !!!!!<br />Its a good app
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|This was an exciting read. I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />I thought most of the major character story lines were brought to a close reasonably well. Although, a bit light on details in some cases, but probably as much as could be expected after a meandering 13 book buildup.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|A fantastic movie but I gave it three stars because the 3D version is very grainy.  The flight scenes were very cool, but overall just not worth the cost of this re-release.  Best enjoyed in HD.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I like the game it is fun to play however I don't like the fact that you run out of lives and that it is hooked up to facebook to get friends to get more lives.
B000FC1GJW|5.0|I've read the paperback version of this book and loved it.  Can't wait to read it on my Kindle.  :)
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I enjoy seeing grandchildren's pictures.  And children and grandchildren of friends.  Some people put a status every day and this can get so trivial...
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|This app is for business people.  Its a social network but specializing in professional connections. Here even companies will look for a profile to have an idea before even hire you.  If you are into social media be careful what you post here just be professional and keep it like that everywhere.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Love this app.  Easy to use, very informative and fairly accurate.  Easy to check in the morning and figure out how to dress myself and my children!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|No comparison with any other app around for weather.  Here you will get all you need where ever you are. Informations at your finger tips.
B009X01FJS|4.0|This is a great case.  The Revolving plastic cover inside the case is excellent; it was something I didn't think I needed until I talked to other Kindle owners.  It's great quality as well.  Highly recommend this case.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|This TV series was the best ever!! What action, what drama and what a protector. There is no one like Jack Bauer! But Keifer Sutherland is a close second..tee hee. The story lines were fantastic, I don't know how many times I sat on the edge of my seat watching this show. A great one.
B000IYU9IG|4.0|One of the most fun, clean, family movies ever. Enjoyed by many generations. You can't help but enjoy it too.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Story of a 50 year old who has early onset Alzheimer's disease. I had had experience with the disease with older people. I am sure they went through many of the experiences that Alice did in the story. Very interesting to view from inside Alice's head and the way she perceives various situations. Reflected back to my Mom and how I would have done some things differently with the knowledge I picked up in the book. Was a bit disappointed the story ends with Alice still in the process of degenerating.
193700788X|5.0|It was with trembling hands that I picked up Dead Ever After by Charlaine Harris early on Mother's Day. I had only one expectation - that Charlaine Harris stay true to Sookie Stackhouse and not cave to the mass hysteria that was threatening the Sookieverse. That is all I asked - did Charlaine deliver?<br /><br />Yes, I think she did! I will be addressing my reasoning behind that later. Right now I just want to reach out through cyberspace and slap all the readers out there threatening to kill themselves and egg Charlaine Harris' house just because she didn't provide Sookie Stackhouse with a man who was not suited to her.<br /><br />No author should be threatened like that.<br /><br />Ever.<br /><br />The White Elephant in the Room: Team Eric<br /><br />Did none of you fans read ANYTHING Harris wrote in the 12 other Southern Vampire Mystery books?! Sookie DID NOT want to be turned! Sookie wanted babies more than anything else. She also wanted to be NORMAL. How on earth is Eric Northman supposed to provide any of that?<br /><br />Okay, now I am going to address WHY I thought Dead Ever After was a good book:<br /><br />*Regardless of what the blinkered fans thought, Charlaine Harris addressed the burgeoning attraction between Sam and Sookie very early on in the series. The pair ending up together was pretty obvious and, to be honest, a welcome reward. Sookie FINALLY gets her normal happy ever after!<br /><br />*Eric stays true to character. Yes, he does. Please stop throwing rotten tomatoes at me. We ALL know why we love Eric - he's the classic bad boy. Right from the start he admits that he is bad to the bone and that he's done things for the sake of doing them. The man really has no conscious. Yes, I do believe he loved Sookie. Yes, their relationship was smoulderingly HOT. Yes, he would pick power over a human.<br /><br />*All the characters get a look in. While some fans are complaining a lot of the characters seem watered down, at least they get a mention. At least their individual stories are touched upon and tied up neatly where needed.<br /><br />*Sookie stays true to herself. Right from the very start we all knew how much Sookie wanted babies. And how much she believed in the afterlife. If Charlaine Harris let Sookie have Eric, there would have been a book 14 and it would have been called `Dead by Suicide'. Sookie would have ultimately suffered had she lost the two things that meant so much to her.<br /><br />You can read my full review here: [...]<br /><br />All in all, I am giving Dead Ever After by Charlaine Harris 4.5 stars out of 5.ded.    *Sookie stays true to herself.

B00ADQCBEY|3.0|Good show to workout to. I put it on and walk on treadmill for an entire episode. I would suggest this show to my friends.
B002QYSZBO|4.0|A fun, post-modern take the noir Film. Downey Jr. And Kilmer have a great rapport propped up by a lot of jokes.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Senna was the ultimate fighter, Great driver with more talent and drive than any other driver of the era.<br />I worked in Brazil for an automotive company and I went to his grave site in Sao Paulo in 1996, it was very humbling.<br />There was a worn path in the grass to his stone on the ground. I touched it and serveral women were there, they wipe it and polished it every day. He was the countries hero.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|A really practical, useful application which allows to take quick notes and keep them safe from prying eyes with a password. Excellent!!
B001JNND9W|4.0|I bought the movie for my brother he always wanted to have it.<br />He like it a lot. White Charger KEWL!!!!
B000002OR4|1.0|It was not what i was looking for.<br />I was looking for the movie, maybe my mistake, I did not see it is just the track music of the movie.
B00BMCAM6M|3.0|The sound is good and so are the playlists. I have never had a song fail to play all the through on a 3G connection.<br /><br />But the channels appear to have a limited number of listeners. The most popular channels have long pauses between songs, even on 4G. I've often waited 30 seconds or more between songs. The wait is just a couple of seconds if you're listening to jazz or classical. On classic rock channels I've even been bumped off the channel altogether.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Sigh...so this is the end of the cookie stories...is  always, it is filled with action, past characters, and as always humour...the kind of humour that jumps out at you in the middle of a tense moment...and make  you bark with sudden laughter...I have enjoyed  every novel in this series, and although I know all things must end, I will miss graduates rookie, an  her crazy assed life...oh well...when I feel the need, I will just start from the beginning again...cheers
0440245915|5.0|I have read all the grisham novels and this one by far is my favorite. A time ro kill and the street lawyer are the ones I re-read the most.
1439156816|5.0|I have always loved Stephen King's unerring brilliance at story telling, his insight and his compact, punchy prose. This book is no exception. Humorous, irreverent and straight to the point, On Writing is half memoir and half 'how-to'. Whilst the writing tips he offers are standard, King's direct, unpretentious presentation is inspiring. As a long-standing fan, I also loved the peephole he provides into his world. A must-read for Stephen King fans, with the added bonus of wickedly direct writing assistance for fellow scribblers.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I remember I was first introduced to community when I was very sick and it provides a lot laughs. I feel in love with the show and let go of a lot of the stress I was under. Alison Brie was my favorite. I thought her character was cute. Joel Mchale comes off as a character hard to like but he plays it well enough you can see there is a good guy inside of him. Danny Pudi gives one if not the best acting performances. His character is not easy to play and becomes a series favorite. His character Abed is very into film and I can relate. I like to collect movies and talk about them. Chevy Chase best known for the Vacation movies makes a strong comeback here as a rich old man going to community college to fill his time and make some friends. His character is not likable but there are a lot of shades of the old Chevy Chase from the Vacation from the 80s movies not the one who faded away in the 90s. Donald Glover does a great job playing the ex football star who got injured and could not play football anymore thus fore fitting any scholarships given to him by colleges to play football. His character starts off to be a little full of myself and tries to act like he's a tough guy. Troy is really sensitive and Abed the character he makes fun of so much in the pilot ends up being his best friend. Glover and Pudi play great together as friends. Gillian Jacobs is another one of my favorites. I could identify with her as her character is my age and still deciding what to do with her life. College seems to be a good option for her. Jacobs is a smart character not easily to be fooled by Mchale and his elaborate plans to hook up with her. The two have a great relationship. They play off each other well but perhaps Britta's character change in Season 3 was best. It made her character more fun and Jacobs got to show off her talents showing two different sides of the character. I find Britta adorable and silly. Yvette Nicole Brown plays a mom returning to school. She is very religious.She is like a mother to the girls and also like one of them when gossiping. She clearly has a good heart and one of the more likable characters on the show. I highly recommend you tune into this show. The hardcore fans have prevented the show from being cancelled the past three seasons. There is a reason the show is still on. Community has a cult like following and perhaps not everyone will get the humor but I suggest you rent it from your local library and give it a try. Community has made me smile during some of the more trying times of my life. I hope it will do the same for you! Cheers!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I didn't think this movie looked very funny when I first saw trailers in theaters, but found it thoroughly enjoyable upon watching it recently via streaming.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Wonderful insight into the social order and economics of nature. Political Science Dictionary. Should be required in school. The Charles Darwin of economics and political science.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|got a little confusing a at couple of points. . Still, it is a good read and I will continue to read them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Does just what I want it to.. Same as the larger game on our desk top computer...We love it. Thanks
B00C1C0UI2|5.0|If John Wayne were around, it would have been a movie he'd have starred in. He and Sean Connery would have been a great team.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Very pretty, easy to use,  and functional. I wish that it had more features though. Adding alarm fade in and fade out with custom duration along with decreasing snooze times would make this a 5 star product.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|If I were in a tomb, she's exactly what I would want to raid it. I mean those things are overrated.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This is a great story, with an amazingly talented leading lady!  I hope this show gets the recognition it deserves.
B005HED11Y|5.0|A fine introduction to science fiction for any grandchild. I know mine have always thought so ,and so did yours.
0066620996|5.0|I order these books for a leadership program in my organization.  Everyone was impressed with the book and there was a lot of learnings that was shared.
B005LAII80|5.0|I can't skip all the previews and jump straight to the movie.  Could not press the Menu on my BD Dics, says Function not avaliable. Had to fast forward instead.  Else, its prefect, good movie with good resolutions and sounds.
B003U6HQGW|5.0|Whatever 'freedom' is, the human spirit yearns for it. The souls in this story epitomize this drive to live and yet to remain 'human' despite inestimable hardship. On finishing these pages one feels like having said goodbye to dear comrades. A deeply moving story.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I really like this game cause these games rock they just blew my mind it still does!!!!!!!<br />This game just ROCKS like my title says!!!!!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is wonderfully gripping entertainment that grabbed me from the first episode.  I love watching it on my Kindle without the commercial interruptions.  Kevin Bacon and the entire cast are fantastic.  Can't wait to find out what happens in Season 2.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved it! I'm happy they are making a second one. It was extremely suspenseful. I just love love it.
B00111YM5G|2.0|Movie is very bad, looks like it was produced on a high school stage and other than Andy the acting is very bad, maybe because the writing and sets are terrible.  Loved Andy in Spartacus but this is not good.
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|What started out to be a very boring story, turned into a page-turner while we tring to solve the mystery of 2 children separated at an orphanage  finding themselves attracted to each other as adults only to find that they are actually brother  and sister. A good read for anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|It's obvious that GoPro gets you with the ad-ons that make it a complete product. That being said, this is one of the ad-ons that really make the camera much more complete. The LCD view screen was very easy to use and the picture quality is great. would highly recommend getting this if you'd like to be able to see exactly what you capturing.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Great upgraded components !only bad thing is they dropped the sunrise/sunset tables. . . or at least I can't find them.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Very good reading, I liked the first book better. Still had tough time putting this book down at night. Another good one!
B000SEFNMS|4.0|An interesting study of personality.  You have to understand his frustration with his family, but wonder why he couldn't deal with it in another less self distructive way.  One comment a fellow book club member said he must have had a lot of guardian angels to be able to live through all his close calls but then ran out of one when he really needed it.  He seemed to lack common sense for being an intelligent young man!<br />It would have been a better read if the author hadn't had to include his adventures that didn't really add to the story.  He seemed to have to prove that he was as brave and adventurous as the young man it was really about.
B004UID2LC|5.0|its great i can access all my favorite sites and watch it right in my hand and take it anywhere with me  thanks
B00BF11STU|5.0|Such a provocative and fascinating movie--and still relevant today.  It definitely gets into the politics which I really like.  I also recommend Hurt Locker by Jessica Chastain.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It's awesome it really let's you use your imagination! The only bad thing is I don't really like the characters they give you It would be awesome to make your own character so I bought the goth girl ! It's an awesome game!
B001G8XON0|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband on our 39th wedding anniversary, it is a love story after all.  We have loved it from our first viewing many years ago, and discovered that it needs to be watched more than once and we love it more each time.  The music, the costumes, the tragic love story, the choreography are all spectacular.  The  Blu-ray enhances all that &#34;wonderfulness&#34;.  It's a bit unconventional and quirky - but that is just all the  more enduring.
160774273X|5.0|Premier Book Dealers were great to order from. The book looks like new and it arrived just days after the order was placed. Based on this experience, I'll buy more books from them.<br /><br />Regarding the book, it's fabulous! We have bought Ken's breads, pastries and meals for years. We moved to the Bay Area a couple years ago and haven't found bread OR ANY pizza that compares with Ken's. While I'm doubtful I can reproduce his product exactly, just having his method for home-baking breads and pizza doughs is awesome. Can't wait to get baking!! Thanks Ken!
B009XPGJYY|5.0|It's additive, all the actors are perfect for their characters, absolutely LOVE this show!!!!  Can't wait for the next seasons to come out.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|We thought this movie was pretty good. Not as good as the Mission Impossible series, but still good. Tom Cruise is still a great actor. In this movie he drives rather than runs :-)
B007V5CF5K|4.0|First time I played a game by this developer and I would have spent all day playing it until I finished. Best $.99 I've spent very entertaining!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Amazon has done a great job of putting together a mobile APP.<br />We have Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, 10.1's and it works easily and understandably. A quick download and installation and it is up and working. Its not, too cluttered and easily worked.  Good job !
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I didn't really care for this game. I guess if I had not gotten so impatient it may have been okay.
B00BRUZ5WA|5.0|Heard Brushy One-String on NPR playing Greys in My Blue, and loved it. Continued to hear this brotha's story, and was amazed at his perseverance. Then I heard Destiny and got chills. Song so truthful, soulful and real. Been playing it nonstop since I copped it. Also had to pick up the studio track of Destiny. Now I hope he releases the version Destiny on his Youtube channel. Keep the real music coming Brushy.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|Sandra Bullock looks and acts great in the romantic comedy.  Great cast, especially Betty White.  The Easter egg hunt and pow wow were histerical.  No quite for all the family, but a great date night movie.
B002T3A4KW|3.0|Very funny script, likeable characters. Performances are fine (though Roberts's falls short of the other principals'). This just feels too much like either a) a screenwriter's wet dream put to paper or b) yet another meticulously calculated--and manipulative--fantasy about how stars' lives are more difficult than everyone else's. That might be a little unfair, but the film is so slight that I don't feel much guilt about giving it short shrift.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Only negative is that getting new cards is very difficult without spending real dollars. Gameplay is smooth and runs great on my Kindle Fire.
1451695195|4.0|I have read both this book and Dr. Mary Neal's.  Of the two, I prefer Dr. Alexander's because he, a neurosurgeon, analyzed possible neurological explanations for his near death experience, while Dr. Neal, an orthopedic surgeon, did not do so for hers.  Both authors spend more time discussing their family relationships than their NDE's.  It is clear that both authors believe their experiences to be genuine, and both were profoundly influenced by them.
B0025WX2YW|4.0|I loved the costuming and the scenery. The acting was great too. I would recommend all 4 seasons if you like grandeur.
B005TBQS0Q|5.0|My husband served two tours in Vietnam, all of 1968 and half of 1969. I have had to follow him out of the theater during several movies that have clips about Vietnam or in some way reference it. This is one of the few that he not only watched but still comments on as to how it presented one of the few positive memories he and probably others have of their time in Vietnam.
