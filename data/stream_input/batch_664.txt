B000ICL3KG|5.0|When I first considered Al Gore's involvement in a scientific topic my instinct was to recoil because he is a constant target in the full contact game of politics. After hearing a surprising number of positive reviews about the science itself I finally gave in and it was worthwhile. The director of this film and Al Gore both did what I have struggled with for years, combining the socioeconomic and geopolitical issues of global warming with the conclusive work of scientists. <br /> <br />This easy to understand documentary explains one of the most troubling issues people all over the world will face now and in the coming decades. While the problems of global warming are not apocalyptic, there is no doubt that societies and the economies which drive them need to adapt now to handle the changes as well as find solutions that prevent further negative impacts on the atmosphere.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend the film and book but encourage everyone to also go to the UN's IPCC website to read through the reports outlining the science, impacts, and responses.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I like this album a lot. I listen to it all the time (well, not really) both as an album and as individual tracks. They stand alone very well (unlike Octavarium) but also are good as an album (but Octavarium is better as a whole). An album with 5 10-minute plus songs, a 7-minute song, and a 3 minute song. Oh yeah. I like long songs, so of course it's logical that I like this album. It's heavy and it's got some shredding from everybody except Myung, who is fairly restrained on this album. I'll go into an in-depth review. <br /> <br />1. As I Am -8/10- Good, but not quite as great as some of the others on this disc. <br /> <br />2. This Dying Soul -10/10- I really like this one. It's heavy, proggy, and it carries the story of AA, so it's got a good story. This one is a Dream Theater classic. <br /> <br />3. Endless Sacrifice -11/10- This one is probably my 2nd favorite Dream Theater song, next to Octavarium. Just... Really great. It takes a while to \\"get it\\" but once you do, you're addicted. <br /> <br />4. Honor Thy Father -7/10- Not as great as some of the others... A bit over-aggressive and has more profanities than needed (0). Good as a workout song, though. <br /> <br />5. Vacant -10/10- A little break from the heavy. Beautiful and bassy, especially on a good sound system. <br /> <br />6. Stream Of Conciousness -8/10- Good instrumental, but loses my interest a little at times. <br /> <br />7. In The Name of God - 11/10- Another classic. Rifflicious with an absolutely insane unison solo with Rudess and Petrucci. And I love the bass thing that Myung lies down. Really a great song. <br /> <br />OVERALL: 10/10 - Here we have 2 absolutely amazingly perfect tracks (Endless Sacrifice, In The Name of God), 1 that's a great heavy one (This Dying Soul), a beautiful soliloquy (Vacant), and the remaining three are good, with As I Am being the best of them. So half of it's legendary and half of it is just a strong DT album. Highly recommended if you like heavy stuff.
B00008YJH5|5.0|first heard \\"where is my mind\\" in LOST across america along with \\"ten percenter\\" (not on this cd), i was like i have to get that cd (surfer rosa), i listened to it once and was like man this sucks and i put into my box of cd's instead of on the rack.  I found it a few months ago, covered in dust, and decided to check it again.  What the hell was i thinking that night, i guess i was expecting more songs like where is my mind? but none the less this is classic stuff, the drums are in your face, the lyrics are quirky and weird but playful, and kim's voice adds a nice touch, if it doesn't grab you at first which is most likely give it a few more tries
0618680004|3.0|If one agrees with Richard Dawkins, as I do, that concluding God's existence should not rely on an act of faith, but should survive a rational thinker's potent skepticism, one comes to consider Dawkins' central argument against the existence of God as the creator of our universe.<br /><br />Dawkins submits to us that the complexity of our universe requires a long chain of prior events to become so complex.<br /><br />Dawkins further submits that beings capable of creative design are not at the beginning of such a long chain of events but follow such a chain of events.<br /><br />Dawkins sees human beings as being the result of a long chain of prior events, and sees us as creative designers. So, Dawkins and those who regard God as a creative designer are at least in agreement that such preconditions for a creative designer to exist can be satisfied, since here we are. But could a creative designer create an artifact as complex as an entire universe?<br /><br />Dawkins submits that for a creative designer to have designed the universe, the creative designer, himself, would have had to have undergone a long chain of events prior to the creation of the universe.<br /><br />If we regard the universe we perceive as the totality of that which exists, Dawkins has ended the discussion by reducing the thesis of a creator of the universe to absurdity, and his denial of the very possibility of a universe-creating God is justified.<br /><br />But if a cosmology is possible in which that which we regard as our universe is not the whole of that which exists but is merely a part of existence, the paradox vanishes followed close order by the absurdity of the proposition that the universe could be a created artifact.<br /><br />The Hebrews identify God in their scripture as being Eternal -- as having always existed. If there exists a being with this trait, we can derive from  that premise:<br /><br />1) An eternal being would have sufficient time to develop his intellect, imagination, and other prerequisites of creative design;<br /><br />2) Such a being would have time to learn a great deal, try out different philosophies, paradigms, methods, and so forth.<br /><br />The possibility of the Eternal Hebrew God, so long as God's existence is something additional to the universe as we regard it -- that existence is more than that which we regard as The Universe --  therefore survives Dawkins' challenge to our reason.<br /><br />Dawkins is free to demand a proof that such a being exists, but if, like existence itself, consciousness is a property of existence itself -- then like existence, itself, there is no basis to demand a proof for that which would be the self-evident foundation for all further proofs.<br /><br />We would not therefore be looking for proof of God in the sense of a mathematician deriving one, or in the sense of a scientist conducting experiments to test a thesis, but in the sense of seeing if we encounter such a being who can present us with experiences sufficient to satisfy our doubts.<br /><br />Dawkins has not had such experiences. I have. Dawkins hasn't convinced me that my conclusion that my skepticism was sufficiently satisfied was irrational. Unless Richard Dawkins has experiences that personally convince him that his skepticism has been satisfied, it is reasonable for him to continue disbelieving in God until he has experiences satisfactory to his reason.<br /><br />But Richard Dawkins demand for reason to be applied to the question of God existence is, itself, quite godly, seeing as how to create a universe as complex as the one we find ourselves in one would require a being who is himself a scientist.<br /><br />J.

1599869470|1.0|I will probably be sending this back. It's very difficult to understand, I know you're not supposed to read it like a novel, that you are supposed to use it like a workbook, but I still didn't understand it. It just has a bunch of quotes, it's worded in a way that we no longer speak, (it was written over 100 years ago) and I just don't get it. A definate snoozer in my opinion.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Truly one of the great albums.  As I recall, at one time this was the best selling album of all time.  It doesn't get much better than this.  No frills, just great music.  Well deserved recognition for a legendary song writer.
0374105235|5.0|\\"A Long Way Gone\\" is an exceptional book. Ishmael Beah delivers a firsthand account of the horrors that are occurring in Africa everyday. The book is about how Beah loses his family, is enlisted in the government army as a young boy, commits countless acts of violence, and is eventually rescued by UNICEF and rehabilitated. \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is not a book for the faint-of-heart. It describes, in detail, the horrific violence that the author experiences and commits. The book is meant to come across this way. It is meant to shake-up the reader. But \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is not a blood-and-guts war book, and should not be understood as such. The book is about how the innocence of childhood can be stolen. It chronicles how the author lost his humanity, and ultimately, regained it. This is an excellent book on many levels. I recommend it to anyone who wants to better understand the atrocities occurring in Africa, or to anyone who wanting to know what it means to be human.
B000M06K5C|5.0|So, Bloc Party's sophomore album is incredible. Not nearly as fast paced as their debut \\"Silent Alarm\\", as a matter of fact there's no song on this album which would fit on that album. This album contains so much more emotion and feel than were used to seeing from Bloc Party. I've lived in England since February 2005, and this album feel's like it. Every song on the album is very well put together, and there is quality felt all around. From Song for Clay (Disappear Here), which makes you want to party and thrash about, to SRXT, which is so melodic that it gives you goose bumps, this album is awesome. Definitley a diamond in the rough. I've listened to the whole thing front to back round 20 times or so, and it's better every time I hear it. So, if you want good Brit/Post-Punk/Indie/Rock, Bloc Party's new concoction is all you. Buy and enjoy!
B000J10ERO|5.0|Need I say anything more? I mean, first of all, I'm a Super-Fan, I liked the movie, and I love it when DVD's come out choc-ful-o-extra features like Behind-the-Scenes and stuff. I'm very pleased with this DVD. As most of you may already know, there are two versions of the DVD that are out. There's this one and then the other one that has only the movie. If you like special features, you need to get this one. Besides, for some odd reason, this one is kind of hard to find in the stores these days.
B000JRBOZY|5.0|I don't have television, haven't for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.<br /><br />I really wish Amazon Unbox would allow me to burn shows I've purchased. As it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer. When Unbox expands this service to allow me to burn DVDs I will likely purchase many more shows this way. I like selecting individual shows.
1416914285|5.0|These days, \\"urban fantasy\\" is a huge genre in young adult fiction, and an awful lot of it is indeed generic---cheap spin-offs of Harry Potter and weak attempts at Tolkienesque dragonistry, cranked out to meet an insatiable market.  <br /> <br />So when a new book in this overworked realm comes along that is genuinely fresh, exciting, and well-written, I do a private little happy dance. \\"City of Bones,\\" clever, original, and---above all--witty, is as delightful to me as to my teenage nephew and his preteen sister and cousin. <br /> <br />The book has the requisite vampires and werewolves, mysterious runes and ominous neighbors with dimensional portals in their living-rooms, a librarian with a pet raven and a hidden past, missing parents, and a quest. But it also has flying motorcycles and an all-night diner staffed by ifrits and nixies (with great smoothies on the menu). There is banter. There is glitter eyeshadow. There is, especially, Jace, the pale-eyed, pale-haired Darkhunter who may be the hero of the tale, or may be something else entirely.  <br /> <br />Those who know Cassandra Clare's other writing will recognize her signature mixture of eerie suspense, haunting romance, and wildly funny comedy. She has a way with a quick character sketch, and a marvelous command of language: <br /> <br />\\"The kid had adopted a pose of wide-eyed innocence, head to the side. His eyes were way too bright a green, Clary noticed, the color of antifreeze, spring grass. Colored contact lenses, probably. The bouncer shrugged, abruptly bored. `Whatever, kid. Go on in.' He stepped aside, and the boy slid past him, quick as an eel. Clary liked the lilt to his shoulders, the way he tossed his hair as he went. There was a word for it that her mother would have used--insouciant. <br /> <br />`You thought he was cute,' said Simon, sounding resigned. `Didn't you?' <br />Clary dug her elbow into his ribs, but didn't answer.\\" <br /> <br />In Clary Fray we have a quick-witted, sharp-edged heroine, sister under the skin to Eddi McCandry in Emma Bull's \\"War for the Oaks\\" and Kaye Fierch in Holly Black's \\"Tithe\\"--a teenage girl who is neither a cliché spunky tomboy nor a sugar-coated Barbie doll, but an interesting, fully imagined protagonist. But it is the blond and snarky Jace who holds center stage. <br /> <br />One character likely to be overlooked in reviews of \\"City of Bones\\" is New York City itself. Like Minneapolis in \\"The War for the Oaks,\\" New York is a constant background presence: the quirks of the city, its oddball residents, its strange mixture of modernity and crumbling Victorianism are here seen through the lens of a magical imagination, so that it is transformed just slightly, just around the edges, into something rich and strange. I've always wondered about that abandoned hospital on Roosevelt Island, in the East River. Now I know.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale surprised me.  I was expecting not to like it after someone I trusted gave it less than favorable marks.  But more and more people said it was good, so I bought it on DVD.  What a great film: action packed, thrilling and well written.<br /><br />This Bond film reboots the franchise, and one of the most signifigant changes is the women in the movie are more than scenery.  No more appalling acting just for some eye candy, Eva Green delivers a fine performance in spite of being perhaps the most beautiful of any of 007's costars to date.  She's really something; exotic and confident!<br /><br />Finally, the movie despenses with all of the foolish gadgets, substituting realistic action and violence in its place. Bond is bashed and battered in Casino Royale, and it refocuses the character in reality after years of the over-the-top Roger Moore style camp.
4789009637|5.0|I have been using a couple books in the beginning of my learning Japanese; but after starting this book and reviewing futre chapters, I'd say this beats most if not all of the other books I've seen.  The vocab is set up very well, the subjects are arrainged in a very realistic order (some books make you wait until middle chapters to learn how to tell time???).If you're looking for a simple read through book, this isn't it.  This book forces you to learn the written language and utilizes it heavily early and often.  By the third chapter, the Japanese portion of the lessons no longer come with phonic translating subscript, and nor do the vocabulary pages come with script/japanese-phonic/english-phonic breakdowns;you go from Hirigana to Enlish. Immersion that I have never really seen in a lot of books, but this is done extremely well.  I say all this because if your intention is to learn the phonetic speak, this is not the book for you!  If you want a good, quality and well set up immersion learning book, this book is incredible.  Also, of all the books I've recently looked at and tried to use, my Japanese fiancee gives this one the biggest thumbs up because it forces you to not only speak, but learn to read and write.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|The best things in this literate Wachowski brothers' adaptation of the classic Moore/Lloyd graphic novel are its stars, Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. They bring a depth to the material through their acting that would otherwise be very much lacking. Portman's finely felt work here as the heroine Evey is a revelation, given her woodenness in the recent Star Wars trilogy, but the real acting honors must go to Weaving, who wears a plastic Guy Fawkes mask thoughout the entire film in his role as the dashing Shakespeare-quoting freedom fighter (or terrorist, depending on your perspective): all his acting has to be done without the benefit of facial expression, and damned if Weaving doesn't make an actor's showcase of of the part nonetheless and invest it with multiple dimensions. <br /> <br />The concept of both the film and the graphic novel involves the political resistance of a masked swashbuckler in a totalitarian Britain of the very near future: its resonances in the wake of 9/11 and the Patriot Act are quite strong. The film's visuals are actually a bit heavyhanded: the evil High Chancellor (John Hurt, in an atypical scenery-chewing performance) communicates with his council of lackeys via closed-circuit TV in scenes reminiscent of the famous \\"1984\\" Apple Super Bowl commercial, while his rise to power is documented in clips that almost exactly evoke the Nuremberg rallies documented in \\"Triumph of the Will.\\" The film's scenic designer seems to have felt his audience would be so dim that even THAT wouldn't be enough, and so the Chancellor's Norsefire Party uses as a color scheme black with red accents, as in a Satanic Black Mass. But the intelligence behind Alan moore's original conception for the work overrides this, and Weaving and Portman greatly redeem the material. This special 2-disc DVD features a short on the making of the film's visual look (the producers and director and scenic director seem intent on convincing us that what they've done with it really brilliant, which seems funny in a film all about propaganda), another on the original Moore/Lloyd graphic novel and the new wave of comics, and a third on the historical underpinnings of this film in the Gunpowder Plot and Guido \\"Guy\\" Fawkes.

B000JLTRKE|4.0|I have not watched it yet, but I remember when this actually happened but I am sure the movie goes into more details then CNN or FoxNews did.
B000GIXIGY|1.0|Ever since i first heard of Renaissance I knew i'd more than likely love the band; proggy stuff fronted by a female singer with lots of medieval overtones? Check. And sure enough, when I finally heard Renaissance by way of 'Turn Of The Cards' I knew I had to buy the album eventually. Just a stellar piece of progressive rock.<br /><br />Where the problem arises is that in my haste to purchase the album, I made the mistake of assuming the logical fallacy of chronological snobbery. Namely, I ignored the previous editions being offered as I assumed that such copies (made around '94) wouldn't be exactly remastered. So, under this assumption, I bought this edition which was published in 2006, which I felt would probably be adequate in sound quality (I avoided the mini-LP version that was also listed because I tend to never touch any of my cds that are housed in those). At anyrate when I finally got the cd in from Amazon I was absolutely appalled to see what my $12 had gone towards.<br /><br />The front looked fine enough, but the back gave me my first indication that there was something wrong afoot with this edition; along the bottom was in big red letters: oldies dot com. Annoying I thought, but whatever. However, when I finally opened the cd itself there, ATTACHED to what should have been a cd booklet (which actually was only 1 double sided page with the artwork on the front & band on the back) was a mail-in service form for oldies dot com. This might have been fine had it been an advert that you could throw away, but it was melded together with the cd artwork itself and I actually had to cut it out to be rid of it. It was also around this time that I noticed that in the bottom left corner of backside insert (behind the cd) was a HOLE in the insert itself.<br /><br />A HOLE.<br /><br />I've worked in the used cd industry myself as it turns out and cds with a hole-punch in the back insert generally mean a promotional copy/other such thing and that you shouldn't buy it back for anything close to full value. Now I recognized that same HOLE in my NEWLY PURCHASED CD. Needless to say I am at a total loss and absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND this edition in any way/shape/form. Had I not already opened the box/cd & had thrown away everything else, I would be shipping this back to Amazon.<br /><br />Coincidentally, the mail-order insert I cut out said towards the top, \\"Collectibles Records is the largest and fastest growing independent reissue label in the US\\"<br /><br />For the sake of music lovers everywhere I hope not and would encourage any true lover of music to avoid ANYTHING put out by Collectible Records/oldies dot com like the Plague.uy it back for anything close to full value.

B000G0O5N2|4.0|First off, this is not a sci-fi film where it is all clean with cgi.  This is a real life film with real dirt on the ground.  There is a lot of grain but only if you look for it.  Looking at the ground the battle resides on is where you discover the true abilities of HD.  The level of detail in the surroundings is overwhelming and brings more realism to the viewing experience.  Colors are saturated, but it might have been intended that way.  The sound is all over the place with bullets wheezing and ricocheting everywhere.  And not to mention this is one of the best war movie to date.
B000MGUZM0|2.0|i loved Funeral, the day it came out, a friend bought it. wow Track One soared! Got the pleasure of seeing them in a small club in Milwaukee where they exploded off the stage; one just knew this was going to supernova. <br /> <br />Bought tickets to see them in Chicago this May 2007, the 3 night stint old out immediately. so psyched to hear this album!  prolonged the ecstasy by waiting a week before purchasing, then .. what a yawnfest, in a word .. dour. I struggled hard to find a track i could connect to, even 'living in an age where darkness is called light' or whatever, oh boy ... poorly designed superfluous packaging which does nothing to enhance the experience. feck this stuff, i'm turning in my alt card, i'll be content on waiting until all this crap dies and composts into new death metal. sold my tickets.  <br /> <br />save yr money. i gave it two stars for the melody in track 4, and the fact i can't make an album like this myself.
B000M5AJQI|5.0|I loved the movie and the picture quality is awesome. Amazon.com does a great job with customer service as well. The item was shipped quickly. If you enjoy mob movies this is one for you. Not a movie for children of any age. Cursing and violence are very big parts of this movie but they do not detract from the story if you are mature enough to handle it. Look into the story of the Bulger brothers in Boston for a reference as to where this story might have gotten it's inspiration.
0767817664|4.0|The 80's will not be remembered for giving us the best of anything,but this little known movie is really a very good entry into the vampire genre. Roddy McDowall,Sarandon and Ragsdale turn in excellent performances and the FX are real good too(esecially for the time). I would like to have seen a better DVD treatment for this forgotten little gem! A great movie to watch on Halloween!
1582701709|5.0|This book is wonderful.  It is really common sense, and presented in a manner that is easily read.  The nay-sayers who say it is dangerous must be worried about losing control over some-one or some-thing.  It is mainly positive thinking, and common sense.
0060730552|3.0|`Touching the Void' is the story of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates who climbed the West Face of Siula Grande, a mountain in the Peruvian Andes.  After an accident Simpson has a broken leg and little chance of getting off the mountain alive.  Yates lowers Simpson off the mountain quickly (as they do not have enough supplies to stay on the mountain) and unknowingly off a cliff face.  Simpson cannot beck up the rope and Yates cannot pull him back up.  Seconds before being pulled off the face of the cliff himself Yates cuts the rope and Simpson falls off the cliff and down the mountain.  Yates, leaving the mountain the next morning, thinking Simpson dead, leaves Simpson to crawl off the mountain with his injuries.<br /><br />In the best portions of the book you get both Yates's and Simpson's thoughts about the accident, where they were and what was happening step by step in the days following the accident.  You feel the pain, guilt, fear, and panic in both parties and get the idea that something fantastic occurred on Siula Grande.<br /><br />I say you get the feeling because in the poorer portions of the book you do not understand why one `crevasse' is worse than another, why a `pear shaped cornice' is a bad omen, why it is hard to place a `friend' in a secure position on the mountain, and why a `bollard' is dubious.  In Simpson's words one portion of the mountain blends into the other and you have to be told this portion is scary, or that he is making progressing, rather than seeing why he is scared or how he is making progress.<br /><br />Simpson admits as much in the Epilogue to the book when he says `I simply could not find the words to express the utter desolation of the experience' and to be fair Simpson was not an experienced writer at the time of this book (he has written six since then).  However, you are certainly left wanting for a description you can understand, and emotion that stands out from the rest, and a story you can grasp on to instead of feeling that `you needed to be there'.g that `you needed to be there'. <br />

B00009UW0N|5.0|What better movie to watch on Halloween than \\"Halloween\\". This eerie film still gets me! The Transfer is excellent on this edition and it has some very interesting extras. The best of the slasher films and the one that started a new trend in 80's horror movies.<br /><br />This film has been called the greatest horror movie of all time by some people, while I don't agree with that statement, I do think it ia a very important horror film. Made on a shoe-string budget, this film delivers more chills and suspense then most horror films costing millions. There are several haunting images in this original slasher film. This is a must see and is the perfect film to watch on......Halloween!

0385486804|4.0|`Into the Wild' is a story about Christopher McCandless (a.k.a. Alexander Supertramp) who, a few days after graduation from college, decided to strike out into the wilds on his own.  This trip took him from the east to the west coast of America, into Mexico and terminated in Alaska.  The young lad, ever more desperate to get away from life in America to live out his Thoreau-like fantasies, ended up in an abandoned bus off the `Stampede Trail' where he died of starvation and self induced poisoning (from eating the seeds from the wrong plant).<br /><br />In the better portions of the book you understand step by step the last two years of Chris McCandless's life and why this gifted youth would want to travel so far away from his family and home town.  You understand how he lived and why he died.  You get the feeling that McCandless had the guts to do what many of us simply dream of and you admire him for that.  Also in the better portions of the book you get a fairly unapologetic telling as to the brazen, youth stupid, hubris filled, nature of a person who simply tells no one where he is going and believes he knows more than everyone around him as to what might make him happy in life.<br /><br />The story of Chris McCandless is not one of personal triumph or `going out with a bang' it is the story of a person, who had he survived the trip, probably would have had come back to civilization and apologized for his youthful actions and told his family `it was something I had to do'.  Instead, you are left with a grieving family, who was not contacted by McCandless and instead had to find out about his demise from the authorities, grieving friends and people he met on the road, who do not understand why McCandless had to die and why he had to leave them.  In short, you are left with the actions of a very selfish person who wanted live life in this solitary existence but could not stay away from people long enough to hurt them very deeply.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|What were they thinking?  Why what happened to the James bond movies that we've seen?  This one out too sea.  The music was not a James bond music did not have the girls usually on the screen my big deal at the beginning of James bond music and this guy just doesn't make a James bond there was no, need there was no slip stack or wisecracking marks will drop out of the Moon.  what one a disappointment.  The producers and directors need to go back to the drawing board and try again and make it right this time.  The movie had good action and as far as the acting aires's IP zero in a row and fell one and only with business that I would not have bought it.  The rate this two stars
B00003CXXJ|5.0|It is getting to the point where Hollywood is turning out better cartoon features than good comedies! I have watched all the CGI movies that have come out over the past 10 or so years and I am impressed by the ratio of good to bad there are in these releases. Shrek is at top notch entertaining film! The sequel is very funny too! The DVD transfer looks great!

0780626966|4.0|Who's scarier?...Freddy or Jason? That question has been floating around for many years now and there is no simple answer. Freddy's first film is creepy and has atmosphere, but in the sequels he was transformed into a wisecracking one liner! This took the edge off of his character, but they still delivered some entertaining films. IMHO it's seems like most of the odd numbered films in this series are the best...meaning 1,3 and 7.<br /><br />As far as the Friday The 13th films go.....well, they seem to have more tension, but I don't think the films are really better than the \\"Nightmare\\" films. Jason emained a pretty menacing character throughout all the installments making them a little scarier.<br /><br />This is a very good box set if your a fan of the series. The first film is the best by a mile, but the series is entertaining and the DVD transfers look very good.<br /><br />I rate the films as followed.<br /><br />1) A Nightmare On Elm Street - 4 stars<br />2) A Nightmare On Elm Street part 2 Freddy's Revenge - 2 stars<br />3) A Nightmare On Elm Street part 3 The Dream Warriors - 3 stars<br />4) A Nightmare On Elm Street part 4 The Dream Master - 2 1/2 stars<br />5) A Nightmare On Elm Street part 5 The Dream Child - 2 stars<br />6) A Nightmare On Elm Street part 6 Freddy's Dead - 2 stars<br />7) A Nightmare On Elm Street part 7 Wes Craven's New Nightmare - 3 stars

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Wow. Just wow. I was incredibly and pleasantly surprised by this film. As one of the many who bemoaned the choosing of Daniel Craig as the new Bond, I must now humbly eat my words. I agree with one movie critic (I almost never do that). This is a new James Bond and the series is better for it. <br /> <br />This is one of the first Bond films I have enjoyed as a film (rather than a mere series \\"episode\\") since becoming an adult...well, I guess that would mean ever. A diehard fan up through my teens, I rooted for Brosnan (then known mostly as Remington Steele) till the role was given to Dalton (my favorite ever Edward Rochester), then I celebrated. By the time Brosnan took over the role, I wasn't so diehard anymore. Though I caught and liked Brosnan's outings. I worshipped Roger Moore's Bond till I grew old enough to take a really good look Connery's version.  I appreciated Dalton. And thought Brosnan was the embodiment (at least my embodiment) of the character. But if I had to pick a favorite Bond today, it would be Craig. I'm not sure that I can yet see him as *the* James Bond, but he's definitely the Bond I can relate to most. His Bond is more man and less myth. <br /> <br />In disagreement with another poster, there's very definitely a story here - the making of James Bond. And its strength lies in the character development. Here we can see Bond as a man rather than a caricature. There are still chases and fights and women, but overall it's a movie more about the man than the super spy.  <br /> <br />Was that the result of choosing Craig or a joint success of Craig and the writers? I don't know. But it worked. At the very least, I'd have to agree with another critic in that Craig approaches the character as another role rather than an icon and turns in a great performance for it. Given the fan outcry, he had nothing to lose in playing the role against type. <br /> <br />Although appreciative of Craig's other work, I never realized just how good of an actor he is.Just watch the play of emotions that cross his face. Two scenes stand out. The first was meeting with M in her apartment. (Craig and Dench play off of each other amazingly.) Their dynamic was very much like a shamed boy and his disappointed, yet hopeful mother. I never got that from Brosnan with Dench. The second was the first meeting with Vesper Lynde and they were \\"reading\\" each other. You're not quite sure if she right, but she definitely hit a nerve. Interesting that Bond's greatest vulnerabilities were shown in the company of women. And you can see it move across Craig's face. Very well done. <br /> <br />In agreement with another poster, the movie was about 20 minutes too long-those last 20 minutes at the end. I understand why they were there for character development and story purposes, but the story could have been told without them. If I found anything awkward about the movie, it was Bond's being \\"compassionate\\" and comforting with women.  Here Bond seemed uncomfortable and out of place  - awkward. While that seems right for this particular incarnation of Bond, it made it difficult to link this Bond with the suave operator of the past. Perhaps, that's the point. Here we get the raw, unhoned Bond. The Bond we all know hasn't developed yet. Bravo! <br /> <br />All in all, this is the first Bond film I've ever felt a desire to own.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|I was hesitant as well upon first listening to Arcade Fire's new album; however, I was pleasantly surprised.  It's different in comparison to Funeral, but equally as good.  I do have to agree with a previous commentator that there are a few (two really) songs that I skip, but all in all it's good, and fun to listen to.  Heavy subject matter yes, but somewhat uplifting.  Get the album!
B000EYK4GW|4.0|I own both the Dumbo 60th Aanniversay Edition and the Big Top Edition releases. The 60th Anniversay Edition. is a pretty sad release for such an enduring classic! The print is not as clean as it could be and the extras are lacking! The worst thing is that just a few years later, they released the Dumbo Big Top Edition. The picture on the Big Top Edition is a big improvement,but they omitted the theatrical trailers and some other extras from the previous release(60th Annivesary Edition.... Why take them out?)There would have been plenty of room on the disc for all the extras plus! What they did include are some pretty lame games that even a small child will be bored with in a few minutes. This film deserves a 2 disc Platium Edition. It is the fouth full lenth animated feature from the studio and should be treated with the respect it deserves! This kind of slap in the face is what really irratates me with Disney and some of these large studio decisions. I think the fans of these films have bought them enough times to be treated better too! I don't mind an upgrade from a standard DVD to HD DVD, but don't make me keep both versions because you will not carry over the extras from one to another. I am very glad to see the film is intact with no edits.
1932907009|5.0|I have been developing scripts with friend and writing partner, Anthony Michael Hall, for the past 3 1/2 years. Although the idea of beats and breaks was nothing new-even the feel of where they should go in a script-you still come across those scripts where something just isn't flowing. Blake Snyder's book, \\"Save the Cat,\\" plainly and clearly brings words, concepts and flow into perfect focus. Imagine being able to sit down and have a comfortable conversation with a teacher, mentor, or just someone you look up to in \\"the biz.\\" A chance to pick someone's brain about how you can get to where they are. That's the experience of \\"Save the Cat.\\" No droning diatribe against fledgling writers and their inability to grasp the ebb and flow of classic storytelling. No regurgitation of the \\"rollercoaster\\" concept of screenwriting. \\"Save the Cat\\" is a fun and insightful read. <br /> <br />The most valuable thing about this book that I've found, among a plethora of helpful information, is the Beat Sheet! What an indespensible tool this is! If for any other reason, invest your money in this little gem! <br /> <br />Case and point: Mike and I have been working on one particular script for 2 years. But something was constantly gnawing at me. An itch that something in the story wasn't quite right. The jokes were funny. Many setups and payoffs. But it just wasn't flowing. Several months ago, I picked up Blake Snyder's book and WHAM! There it was.  <br /> <br />The Beat Sheet. It solidified all the tidbits of information I had culled from other books and writers. I had learned several guidelines over the course of writing, (i.e., 10 minutes in you should have an inciting incident, 30 minutes in should be the start of the 2nd act, scripts should be about 95-110 pages, yada yada yada) but here was a tool that broke the movie down into the oultine I had always been trying to organize in my mind. All the beats are there. All the page numbers reflect the points in the movie where your beatsshould hit. Now I'm going back through my script and working out where all the beats and turns SHOULD be and saying to myself, \\"THAT'S why that didn't work there!\\" and \\"No WONDER that didn't make any sense to anyone...at all!\\" <br /> <br />I was so impressed that during a recent trip to L.A. to do some writing with Mike, I passed the book along. Now we're BOTH avid fans! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to learn about writing a good script and for anyone that needs to reaffirm what they already know. \\"Save the Cat\\" makes a clear and simple, yet very effective case as to what kinds of scripts sell in Hollywood, why they sell, and how to write them.

B000M5AJQS|5.0|Maybe all the pieces in this cinematic 'who's the mole?' extravaganza don't add up; any failed police recruit spending a light sentence in prison, should upon release be wearing a T-shirt reading, \\"I AM A POLICE INFORMANT\\", but the mere question, \\"Are you a police informant?\\", and the answer, \\"No.\\", satisfies all suspicion in Martin Scorsese's 2006 Oscar winning Best Picture, \\"The Departed\\". Good storytelling and intense suspense, and finally, a rather supreme film, are just slightly riddled by bullet holes of nagging doubt, like the FBI informant spending nearly the entirety of the film comfortably in the trust of street level Mafia type, while accomplishing nothing, an informant who never informs, or double-crosses; a neutered zone, while spending what must be an adulthood in the brotherhood of Scorsese's gangster kingpin, Frank Costello, (Jack Nicholson). But if you can't find the jigsaw puzzle pieces that fall off the table, or get stuck on the implausible factor, like the big booty for these goodfellas; a nuclear detonating device that can find the hairs off a camels hump from an enormous distance, much like Alfred Hitchcock's 'to die for' 'microfilm', ('bricks' of the nuclear device are passed from a car trunk to a briefcase), and the strangely cliched and martyred Catholic Irish cop, and the king mole who apparently never gains anything for all his troubles, save maybe an unmentioned Swiss bank account, and the post-Archie Bunker mentality towards race, and Scorsese's favorite, and finally, ugly image of gunshot dead gangsters, there is Jack Nicholson's character purring god fatherly sweet murmurs of \\"it's just a movie\\".
B0000060AK|5.0|The singing is glorious for the most part, but the overall effect of this interpretation seems calculated and super controlled at times and at other times careless (tempi) and produces an overall effect which lacks a certain fineness and sincerity of feeling which is annoying and troubling in a subtle and not easily definable way.  This is true with the exception of Lynne Dawson's interpretation which is definately definitive. The tonal colors of this interpretation are silvery compared with the deep rich bronze tone colors in the McGegan (Harmonia Mundi) version.
B000GRUS22|4.0|A longtime Enigma fan, since their first album, I picked up \\"A Posteriori\\" with some trepidation after reading the reviews here. The first spin yielded a lukewarm reception, only the first track seemed to appeal. However, each repeat listen brings up something new that I hadn't heard before and I feel as if I'm hearing a slightly different album every time.<br /><br />Richly layered, \\"A Posteriori\\" is in some ways a new level of sophistication for Cretu, in my opinion. Putting Enigma 1 into the player after listening to this one makes the first effort sound almost jarring and sophomoric by comparison (except for the lovely \\"Callas Went Away\\").<br /><br />My favorites to date have been \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi\\" and \\"Voyageur\\" with certain tracks on the other albums appealing to me more than others. \\"A Posteriori\\" is bidding fair to join my top three Enigma albums and reflects the evolution of sound that Cretu has been following subtly since \\"Roi\\" and more obviously since \\"Voyageur\\".<br /><br />Definitely worth a listen for long-time fans and newcomers who appreciate a more subtle, trance-like sound.
1401308201|5.0|If you love the musical, you will love this book.  But be sure to see the musical first; then read this book because reading it ahead of time would be a \\"spoiler\\" to your theatrical experience, I think.  It has marvelous interviews with the actors; behind-the-scenes explanations of how various components, including Elphaba's makeup was done; interesting background on the lyrics and music; gorgeous photographs of the cast and the spectacular stage sets; etc.  Reading it helped to recreate the magic of WICKED, as well as enhance it, for me.

B000MCH5P4|3.0|First of all the acting was wonderful. Honestly (even the one's acting in the plot I have a problem with at the bottom). I enjoy movies where the plot jumps a great deal but this was a little out there. Maybe someone can fill me in. What was the family tragedy? Was watching with my brother and we kept going back and forth figuring things out (I like that because you have to pay attention). Did Brad's character have an affair? I never understood what it was she could not forgive him for. At one point we thought that maybe the movie had twisted and they were on their trip after loosing the two kids but then how could they when they called the Nanny from Morocco (Nope). Maybe Brad's evil had something to do with the tragedy in Japan (Nope)? The situation in Morocco to me is a possible turn of events. The Nanny with the two kids, eh, could happen. People have done dumber things. But... there is NO one other than the nanny? NO friends, family, no one? How many parents would go to Morocco and leave their children with only the nanny responsible and for how long? What ruined the movie for me was the sub plot of the Japanese girl. What in the world? For one thing there is the issue with the mother. Way to much weight put into that story line. Two, the girl has a problem keeping her panties on because of the mother? Father? Mad because she is mute? Wants to have sex? Detective gets note explaining???? Dad finds daughter and what makes for a very touching father daughter moment??? The end...  What the heck just happened? That added no value to the movie for me and did not even leave me with anything to ponder. Well yes it did but that was to wonder what the heck was that about. Yes we found out how the gun fit in but...but...but. I know not all movies tie up all the loose ends and I even enjoy that in most movies. I liked Babel and the nanny goes to Mexico I can deal with. But the whole Japanese portion of the movie not only does not tie up any loose ends but just unraveled amovie that I otherwise enjoyed.
B0009IW98O|3.0|there is a great album trying to get out here, and not quite making it. there are three alsolutely outstanding cuts on this album that make it something you should have. these are: \\"Bo Diddley,\\" a raw scorching rocker, with wicked guitar. \\"if i were a carpenter,\\" a stunning version of the tim hardin classic. and \\"let it rock,\\" another great raw slice of rock and roll. the 1st & 3rd of these songs appear on the wonderful \\"live bullet\\" album, but the versions here are more raw and powerful than the live performances, making this album a worthwhile purchase. unfortunately, the other six tracks on \\"smokin' o.p.'s\\" are, though enjoyable enough, not essential. so this recording has three seeds of greatness that fully flowered. the rest did not quite make it. hope that helps you decide if you want to purchase it or not.
B000002O51|5.0|This is the third boston album, and retains the boston sound. However, it is starkly different in a couple of ways. In my opinion, the drums sound a little too overproduced. The guitars have a much more airy feel to them than the previous albums, but it fits with the whole album's motif and album cover. This album is also different because for example the first two albums were a collection of amazingly stand-out songs. Here, on third stage there aren't as many stand-out songs, but if you listen to the album all the way through, as one entire piece you can understand the true beauty of it. Its different in this way, and I believe should be listened to differently than the previous two. But its still an amazing album in its own right, as an entire work, and MUCH better than the awful two that followed it.

It was fairly a formulistic transformation movie, where homey girl goes high fashion, without explaining where she got all those clothes and who did her makeup.  But it keep rolling along on a quest to please the irascible Streep (and my employees think I'm demanding!), and made one root (though not all that loudly) for the hapless then stellar Andrea (Emily?).  In the end, not much of a message, except perhaps the banal and obvious, \\"Stay true to yourself\\".

B000NVIXFK|4.0|OK, it's not Moving Pictures or Permanent Waves.  But this album is a modern day masterpiece that needs to be listened to over and over to soak in all of the beauty, majesty and amazing musicianship throughout. \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is something I never would have expected from Rush.  \\"Vapor Trails\\", their last album, was good but was over produced and really sounded like it was recorded with all amps on 11.  \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" has many overdubbed guitars and vocals yet are given space to breath and sound almost perfect.  It's mind boggling that Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart have made this amazing album after almost 33 years together.  Older bands like Journey, Blue Oyster Cult and Foreigner would kill for an album as solid as this one.  But they also don't have many of their original members like Rush has had over the past 33 years. <br /> <br />Highlights include \\"Far Cry\\" (their best first single since \\"Dreamline\\"), \\"Armor and Sword\\", \\"The Main Monkey Business\\", \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\", \\"Hope\\" (absolutely beautiful guitar playing by Lifeson), \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" (a crazy 2 minute instrumental), and the burning \\"We Hold On\\", which closes the album.  There really aren't any weak songs on this CD.  Peart's lyrics are biting and Lee sings them with a compassion and energy yet never reaches the screaming levels of days gone by.  His vocals have matured so much during the last 20 years the word \\"banshee\\" no longer applies. <br /> <br />While Lee and Peart keep up their technical chops on their respective instruments, it's Alex Lifeson who is the real star of this CD.  His textured guitar sounds on both electric and acoustic guitars is awe inspiring.  He also does guitar solos, something that VT was missing dearly.  His bluesy solo on \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\" is very reminiscent of David Gilmour, who he actually thanks in the liner notes.  It's passionate, moving and completely Lifeson.  \\"The Way The Wind Blows\\" is the highlight of S&A.  \\"Pray, and pass the ammunition\\" says it all. <br /> <br />To conclude, a lot of credit needs to go to Nick Raskulinecz, who I believe pushed Rush to create this absolutely beautiful masterwork.  Many Rush fans old and new should find something they enjoy on this CD.  Myself, I think everything on this CD is excellent.

B000EQ47HC|5.0|I find it hard to believe, now, that the first time I heard music from Boston I didn't like it.  What I heard first was their first album, self-titled \\"Boston\\", which is, I think a slightly stronger album than this, their second album.  Looking back I'm sure that at least part of the reason that I didn't like Boston's sound was simply because it was so different.  There was nothing in rock'n'roll even vaguely like the sound Tom Scholz's had conjured up in his basement.  It didn't take me long to learn to appreciate the music, but it sure was strange at first. <br /> <br /> Now Boston is one one of my favorite rock'n'roll bands of all time due, in large part, to Tom's guitar theatrics.  Actually, that's the wrong word to describe his guitar playing,Jimi Hendrix was theatrical, Tom Scholz is simply magic.  I think that his work is too often under-rated, probably because there is so little of it.  To me, though, there is simply nothing to compare to the glittering glissandos that he seems to bring forth in effortless endless profusion.  Combine the very tight overall musicianship of the band, Brad Delp's unforgettable vocals, and lyrics that still, in many cases, speak as much to the social issues of today as they did when written some thirty years ago, and you have an unbeatable combination. <br /> <br /> The melody of \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\" is insanely complex for a rock'n'roll song, which is probably why (along with its six and one-half minute length) that it never got very high on the pop music charts.  Tom Scholz is all over the frets on his guitar and is coaxing every bit of feeling he can get out of it.  When one realizes that he plays no chords throughout this song his mastery of his instrument is truly apparent.  He is, to me, in the same class as Eric Clapton, Duane Alman, Gary Moore, and Roger McGuinn when it comes to a short list of the best rock'n'roll guitarists of all time. <br /> <br /> But he doesn't do it by himself.  Boston was, until their breakup over legal issues with their record label, one of those bands in which each member can be considered a master of his instrument, whether it's Brad Delp and his voice, or Fran Sheehan and his bass, Sib Hashian banging away on the drums , or Barry Goudreau's wonderful rhythm and second lead guitar.  Together they were far more than the sum of their parts as one can tell when listening to any of their various solo efforts or work with other bands.  It was a magic combination such as happens once in a generation or less.   <br /> <br /> What makes Boston's music even more special is that the vast majority of what one hears on the albums was composed and performed by just Tom Scholz and Brad Delp.  They had little help making their music, except for some lead guitar by Barry Goudreau and drums by Jim Masdea.  It wasn't until the first album was sold to CBS that a real band was put together to produce the Boston sound.  Thus, the folks playing up on stage are not only playing some of the most complex rock music ever conceived, they played it note perfect every time, so that Boston's live sound was as close to the album sound as it's possible to get. <br /> <br /> The remastering that Tom Scholz did for this re-issue is simply remarkable.  The richness of Brad Delp's voice on all the songs, but particularly on \\"A Man I'll Never Be\\"' has to be heard to be believed.  The remix has transformed one of my best-loved Boston songs from a work of art into a true gem of the craft of music-making.  Everything about the remix transforms this album and brings the sound alive in a way that one could never experience outside of a Boston concert.  In this day of sound alike rap, hip-hop, and techno, the music of Boston stands as a beacon and an example of true muscianship and dedication to one's craft.  Would that there was more music of this caliber.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|To my mind, the last great Bond movie was \\"You Only Live Twice.\\" Admittedly, it paled somewhat in comparison to its predecessors-- \\"Dr. No,\\" \\"From Russia with Love,\\" \\"Goldfinger\\" and \\"Thunderball\\"-- but given much of followed it, it truly was the last great Bond movie. <br /> <br />Of course, some of the credit for what powered those first five movies has to go to Sean Connery. Connery was Bond, as far as the public was concerned, and he spent years shaking that image off.  <br /> <br />True, he did appear as Bond again in \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\" and \\"Never Say Never Again,\\" but both of those were mediocre efforts. In fact, if rumors are true, and they probably are in this case, the only reason he made \\"Diamonds\\" was for a very sizable paycheck. <br /> <br />Connery's successors just couldn't get it right; sometimes because of the tepid to idiotic scripts they saddled with, and sometimes because they just didn't fit the role. <br /> <br />George Lazenby, a complete unknown, gave a good effort in \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service,\\" which was sandwiched in between \\"Twice\\" and \\"diamonds,\\" but the storyline wasn't that great and he also faced the considerable challenge of being the guy who immediately followed Connery into the role. He was largely derided and pretty much disappeared, appearing in an occasional movie role. <br /> <br />Roger Moore seemed like a logical choice, after all, he was Ian Fleming's original choice. Moore, however, ushered in the error of goofiness and occasional slapstick.  <br /> <br />And he himself never took the role seriously. A fact which carried over onto the screen. He did have two decent efforts with \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" and \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\" but those films were average at best. He also had the distinction on making \\"Octopussy,\\" the worst Bond film to come from Cubby Broccoli line of Bond films.  <br /> <br />Timothy Dalton brought acting cred to the role, but never seemed comfortable with it. And many of us, including me, just didn't buy him as Bond, despite his reputation as a good actor. <br /> <br />Pierce Brosnan came along, and he actually seemed like a good choice. He had actively campaigned for the role when Dalton got it, but was prevented from getting it because of his \\"Remington Steele\\" TV contract. <br /> <br />Brosnan was an acceptable Bond, but his physical appearance (the guy was pretty much rail thin and lacked any muscularity), kept many of us from believing he was capable of actually engaging in the physical tasks Bond constantly faces.  <br /> <br />He does have the distinction of appearing in the best of the non-Connery Bonds, at least pre-\\"Casino Royale,\\" with \\"tomorrow Never Dies.\\" But, thankfully, either he grew tired of the role, or the producers decided he was getting too old. <br /> <br />Which brings us to Daniel Craig. A worthy successor to Connery, and a guy who might even surpass Connery in the role someday.  <br /> <br />Before \\"Royale\\" was released, Craig was the subject of campaign determined to deem him totally unacceptable as Bond. Websites took glee in pointing out he appeared to short, his hair was the wrong color, and a whole host of other real or imaged offenses they believed him guilty of. <br /> <br />I was originally sorta in this camp. But after seeing him in \\"Holocaust,\\" I was suddenly convinced he could pull it off. <br /> <br />And he did. <br /> <br />Of course, Craig benefited from a \\"back-to-basics' approach to the franchise. \\"Royale\\" was the book that introduced Bond and, coincidentally, the only one not made into a film by the Broccoli family, who owned the rights to all the Bond books except \\"Royale.\\" <br /> <br />Well, luckily they gained the rights and decided to start the franchise over. And Craig proves to be a great choice for the role of Bond. Blonde hair or not (it seems like they colored it darker in some parts of the film, and not in others), you come to believe he is Bond. In fact, given the opening sequence, and an intense chaseseen that follows the opening credits, he's probably the most physical Bond ever. <br /> <br />Like Connery, he brings a certain cool detachedness to the part. something you'd expect from a guy who is in many ways an assassin on the British payroll. <br /> <br />He's also taking on a believable bad guy, which helps tremendously. Let's face it, the bad guys can make or break these films. Just think how Auric Goldfinger still looms as the standard against all other bad guys must be judged in the film series. <br /> <br />And \\"La Chiffre,\\" like Goldfinger, is a guy who is quietly sinister.  <br /> <br />La Chiffre is the banker to rich bad guys of the world. Only he makes the mistake of putting all of the money he's entrusted with into an airline stock, and shorting it. \\"Shorting\\" a stock amounts to betting that the stock will lose value and, well, you don't want a lesson in stock trading here do you? Let's just say, La Chiffre loses his arse on the stock market and his clients aren't too happy. <br /> <br />So he sets up a high stakes poker game in Montenegro, figuring that because he's a bit of a mathematical and probability expert, he can't lose and he'll win back all the money he lost on the stock market. <br /> <br />Enter Bond, freshly minted as \\"007,\\" and sent into the game only because he happens to be the best card player in MI6. M doesn't yet trust him, but she knows he's their best bet to win, causing La Chiffre, and all his dirty little secrets, to come running to MI6 and the Americans for protection from his clients.  <br /> <br />Naturally, things don't go quite as planned, and Bond is double crossed more than once. He also is subjected to a torture scene that actually tells us a lot about the new Bond--he's tough, a bit sadistic in his own right and maybe even a little masochistic.  <br /> <br />The film is the most satisfying Bond film since \\"Twice,\\" which was released in 1967. So, nearly 40 years later, they finally get it right. Again.  <br /> <br />It's not perfect. They take their time telling the story, and it does seem to drag a little toward the end when Bond is recuperating from injuries. It also never quite convincing explains the motives of one of the characters who double crosses Bond. But you might disagree. See it. It's well worth buying for multiple viewings.  <br />

B00005V1Y0|5.0|Hilarious, heartwarming comedy spoof (but with a great deal of accuracy) on what goes on behind the scenes of professional ballroom dancing.  This movie never pretends to be anything but just plain silly and colorful fun, but also offers some very real insight on how seriously driven professional ballroom dancers are, from beginners to champions.  There are a number of genuinely moving moments, as well as some brilliant cinimatography.  Well worth buying, and a guaranteed no-miss gift for anyone who has anything to do with dancing!  A+
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Sumptuous, rich, lush and inviting. Like a gilt-edged dream, Joel Schumacher's \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is a triumphant love note to beauty, song and scenery.<br /><br />Adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical (and Gaston Leroux's novel), this movie ends up being beautiful in every scene, with solid acting and and a tragic antihero. The singing, the sumptuous sets, the acting -- all are the ingredients of a musical tour de force.<br /><br />In 1870, a Paris opera house is under new management -- just as diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver, a glorious diva-from-hell) is almost killed by a stage curtain, and stomps out. Fortunately Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum), taught by a mystery tutor, can take over the soprano's role, and soon becomes famous for her singing. Even better, it catches the attention of her childhood sweetheart, Vicomte Raoul (Patrick Wilson).<br /><br />But Raoul doesn't realize that Christine was taught by a disfigured, tortured genius who hides under the opera house. And the Phantom of the Opera is not only determined that Christine should be the star, but also be his wife. And he's willing to kill for it. Can Raoul break the Phantom's hold over Christine, or will she embrace \\"the music of the night\\"?<br /><br />Watching this, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same guy who did \\"Phone Booth\\" and the awful \\"Batman and Robin.\\" Instead it looks as if the love child of Jean Cocteau and Peter Jackson decided to direct a musical, swathed in masks, roses, gilt angels, snow and velvet.<br /><br />And it all wraps around Webber's solid songs (\\"Turn your face away from the garish light of day/turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light/and listen to the music of the night!\\") from the stage musical. Most of the lines are sung, which surprisingly doesn't detract from their believability. And there's plenty of fun with the cameras, whether it's the dizzying views of the backstage, or a zoom through a stone floor to the Phantom's face.<br /><br />Schumacher also adds a few extra scenes, including a sword fight between Raoul and the Phantom, which makes the vicomte seem more passionate; and a flashback to the Phantom's horrific childhood. What's more, the story is framed by scenes from forty years later -- sepia-toned scenes in the dusty remains of the Opera.<br /><br />The three most prominent roles are what make or break this movie, and in this case, the casting is nearly ideal. Rossum has the ingenue looks -- and the powerful pipes -- to carry off the role of Christine, torn between her love and her passion. Similarly, Patrick Wilson gives some brains and strength to Raoul, and despite the romantic appeal of the Phantom, Raoul isn't hard to cheer for.<br /><br />Gerard Butler is a bit more difficult. Most of the time his singing is solid, and his acting is powerful and tragic as the \\"loathsome gargoyle, who burns in hell, but secretly yearns for heaven.\\" The scene where he tries to seduce Christine is deeply sensual. But occasionally his performance gets really hammy, such as the unmasking, where he flings himself around screaming, \\"You little prying Pandora! You little demon!\\"<br /><br />And how does the blu-ray measure up? Well, the regular DVD was hailed for its sumptuous colours and visuals, as well as the lovely songs. Those things are all enhanced by the blu-ray release -- everything just seems so much more brilliant.<br /><br />Lush, exquisite and passionate, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is a solid adaptation of Webber's musical, with good acting and excellent direction.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|There are plenty of other reviews available so I won't add much to them.  This is a generally fast paced film with a variety of plot threads and characters to keep things interesting and good dialogue.  Although it's not necessary to have seen the series first it will add enormously to the experience.   <br /> <br />Also if you have not yet purchased this film as of this date, you may want to wait for a forthcoming collector's edition set that will have more extra features.
B000MCH5TU|5.0|I'll get the negative stuff out of the way up front:  This movie has an underlying liberal agenda.  The movie teaches you that GUNS ARE BAD, that people in Afghanistan are not terrorists, that USA politicians are unreliable wishy-washy attention grabbers, and that everyone involved in law enforcement is a bad guy prone to hyperactive violence inflicted on poor, innocent, unarmed poor people.<br /><br />Well, OK, maybe the USA politicians idea is universally accepted as true, but I wouldn't doubt it was being aimed at the current Administration, which is kind of annoying.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I would highly recommend that any mature, thinking, film-loving adult see Babel.  It is an amazing work of creativity, especially in how it slowly reveals the interconnections that span the globe.  At first it is difficult to see any connection between various story lines, and it is at first a bit jarring to have the action completely switch gears and players.<br /><br />However, that feeling of being wrenched from one situation to another begins to change to awe, as you start to sense the intelligence and craftiness that went into the construction of the characters, plot points, and editing.<br /><br />I must say that the storyline involving the Japanese girl was the most intriguing and eye-opening, and the actress playing the girl is perhaps one of the most brave I have seen.  The scene in the disco near the end of her story thread was just amazing and emotionally engaging.<br /><br />On the topic of Brad Pitt, I thoroughly enjoy his performances -- always -- and I think he's one of the best actors working today.  There are probably a lot of people who will disagree with me and say that he's just there for his looks, but ever since I saw him years ago in Legends of the Fall I have been impressed by his performances.  That being said, I think he may not be the best actor for this role.  I can't put a finger on it, but my gut says he's the one who is most mis-cast -- but ever so slightly.<br /><br />Overall, my strong recommendation to see this movie is only extended to those who are not distracted or put-off by mature subjects and nudity.  You must be able to keep an open mind when you see events being portrayed in an anti-law enforcement perspective.  Also, if you are unable to ignore the strong anti-gun undercurrent, then you probably won't enjoy it as much.<br /><br />Myself, when I watch a movie I tend to immerse myself in the story without weighing each point against my own belief system, so I can experience it the way the director intended, even though I may have strong disagreements with Hollywood writers and their social agendas.  The only time I can remember finding myself unable to stay immersed in the story was in the movie, \\"Bridge to Terabithia,\\" with the little 7-year-old kid saying the Bible said the other kid was \\"going straight to Hell\\", but fortunately there was nothing in Babel that was quite so outrageous that took me out of it.st mis-cast -- but ever so slightly. <br /> <br />Overall, my strong recommendation to see this movie is only extended to those who are not distracted or put-off by mature subjects and nudity.

B000MCH5P4|3.0|What does a poor Moroccan sheepherding family, an affluent white American couple on vacation and a mute teenage Asian girl in Japan have to do with each other? According to the plot of this film, everything!<br /><br />The '06 release of the film `Babel'* appears to possess the perfect title for a storyline involving individuals who are unknown to each other yet subtly interconnected through a series of random acts of friendship, indifference and stupidity. The intention being that what we do is not done in a vacuum, every action has the potential to affect others in a myriad of ways. It's a world of endless possibilities.<br /><br />'Babel' does explore a rather fascinating subject matter which in and of itself makes for an interesting watch. The difficulty with the film is that it attempts to weave three storylines into one coherent, enjoyable whole. The connection between the three is ultimately accomplished, but they unfortunately don't command equal interest in the viewer thus detracting from the overall flow and continuity of the movie. I found myself becoming distracted and unfocused when the film left the central theme involving Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett and then reconnecting when the plot returned to the two main stars in Morroco. This imbalance damages the film, but it's still well worth the watch nevertheless.<br /><br />*Babel is the ancient Biblical site where God scattered mankind throughout the world by changing our one common tongue into a myriad of languages. This inability to communicate with each other not only separated us geographically, but has served as a major cause of alienation ever since.

0374105235|4.0|Ishmael Beah lived through and shares with the reader an experience that should befall no one, let alone a child, yet re-emerged somehow with his humanity intact.  Well written, his book is paced to maintain the reader's interest, but details the horrors of a civil war in which both sides exploited the children they had made orphans, using drugs and the unchecked power of weapons to cruelly terrorize those victims caught in the middle.  This is a story that needs to be told, as it leaves unanswered the question of why this war even occurred in the first place, and why, as Americans, did we know so little of it. As demonstrated by the current headlines in Darfur and elsewhere, regional conflict continues throughout parts of the world we are unfamiliar with and seemingly can overlook, yet the scale of death and atrocity far exceeds anything we can imagine.  The best way to prevent such strife from continuing is to tell of it.  Ishmael Beah has done so in a compelling way.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|Edward Norton is an absolutely brilliant actor and he's also very nice on the eyes.  To be honest, I didn't really like this movie, apart from Norton's acting.  I just found that the movie dragged on and on.  When the movie ended I had to shake my head because there was such a plot twist at the end and I didn't see it coming at all.  That part was so well done.  It's too bad that the rest of the film wasn't as interesting.  It's not a perfect film but it is intriguing enough to have you watching the whole film.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The other reviews here say it all, and probably better than I ever could.  The film is brilliant, Polanski's direction is absolutely perfect, but for me, this is Adrien Brody's masterpiece.  I cannot think of any leading performance by a male actor in a film that is better than this.  Mr. Brody OWNS this film, and never has an Academy Award been so well-deserved.  I hope a 2-disc collector's edition is released sometime and I hope they include Adrien Brody's Oscar acceptance speech, which is also stunning!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|It was during a morning acoustic radio program that I heard a portion of \\"The English Ladye and the Knight.\\"  I was instantly taken with the song.  After hearing the artist was Loreena McKennitt, I quickly searched for her on Amazon.  Upon finding \\"An Ancient Muse,\\" I was captivated by the deep hues of blue and the soft glows of orange on the album cover.  Though I was unable to listen to the samples, I immediately decided to order the CD.  After the first and now many listens later, I absolutely adore this recording. <br /> <br />The songs are epic and sweeping in nature.  While listening, one is transported to another time and place.  There is a dramatic and literary quality to her lyrics and music.  One can easily envision her songs accompanying an epic motion picture.  They tap depths of feeling and emotion.  Her voice is quite remarkable.  There is a sense of deep wisdom and maturity.  There is a humanity and universality within.  I do not know how the mere sound of a voice could convey such things, but it does.  Fittingly, the music is organic.  It sounds real and vibrant compared to a lot of the synthetic music that might be associated with this genre.  I do not recognize fully half of the instruments in use, but they sound wonderful.  Her voice and the music blend beautifully.  It is something special to behold. <br /> <br />Additionally, there is a cultural infusion in her songs that I have experienced nowhere else.  Arabic, Jewish, Celtic; the influences are vast.  She is obviously well-read and traveled.  There is a scholarly air to her writing and speech.  There is a real depth to her. <br /> <br />Whereas I love the entire album, three tracks stand out above all others.  \\"The Gates of Istanbul\\" is my favorite.  The organic instrumentation, the beat; it is hypnotic.  I feel transported to a scene from Arabian nights with desert sand and vibrant tents.  \\"Penelope's Song\\" is just gorgeous.  It is an epic love song (written from Odysseus' wife's viewpoint as she awaits his return).  Finally, \\"Never-Ending Road\\" is simply beautiful.  It has a Scottish or Celtic feel.  I would truly feel a loss if these songs were somehow no longer part of my musical library. <br /> <br />I heartily recommend \\"An Ancient Muse\\", as well as her two previous recordings, \\"The Mask and Mirror\\", and \\"The Book of Secrets.\\"  Those two albums share the qualities of this most recent.  Her earliest recordings lean much more heavily to the Celtic influence with harp and minimalist accompaniment.  If that is your preference, she does it better than anyone. <br /> <br />If you enjoy this style of music, I know of no artist who does it any better. <br />

B0002A2WDQ|5.0|In the 1980s there was a great blues music revival, much like the sixties, except the young musicians who created it were more knowledgeable and better educated than the generation before; probably because they were the children of that generation and were standing on their shoulders.<br /><br />Some of this revival took place in cinema with movies \\"The Blues Brothers\\", \\"The Commitments\\" and this one.<br /><br />These movies actually helped the entertainment mainstream find it's way to great black artists like B. B. King, John Lee Hooker and many others who never had more than cult followings previous to this.<br /><br />Many sixties blues fans never knew where the Crossroads was or the significance of Bob Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", the legend of Robert Johnson, the fabulous musical history of Clarksdale Mississippi or Highway 49.<br /><br />This film explores those modern American legends as the historical (there really was such a person who was a noted bluesman) yet fictional (this story is fiction) character Willie Brown, played by Joe Seneca; takes a Juilliard of music student on a tour of the Mississippi delta on a quest to redeem his soul from the devil by a guitar duel to the eternal death with Jack Butler (played by Steve Vai).<br /><br />The strongest point in this film is the music itself; the soundtrack by Ry Cooder and including his incredible jam with the great Steve Vai.<br /><br />If you're white and a blues fan, this movie is a fantastical microcosm of the aforementioned white blues revivals. If you're black and a blues fan, it's a slice of Black Americana being discovered by the mainstream and you can probably enjoy it tongue in cheek if you're a hardcore music fan.<br /><br />I loved it.

The first recipe I tried was the Pumpkin Cupcakes with Cinnamon Icing. I never ate any dessert more delcious! My Dad even liked them and he sneers at anything vegan. This weekend for St. Pat's day I made Vanilla Cupcakes (colored green) with Vanilla Buttercream Frosting. All my friends and family ate them including the kids. No one knew they were vegan until I ate when and they were amazed! I'm going to a party this weekend and I am making the Maple Cupcakes with Sugared Walnuts. I have all the faith in the world they will be the hit of the party. Thanks so much to the authors for giving me back my desserts and making vegan food acceptable to others!

(And, while waiting, I read the book.) <br /> <br />Whether you have ever felt plain, or obscure, like Jane, or broken-hearted, and feeling as if you will forever pay for \\"taking the wrong path,\\" like Rochester, you will be able to identify with these characters and realize there is hope for love for all of us!   <br /> <br />Toby Stephens is unbelievably AMAZING.  Toby Stephens has a new fan.  And, this movie, I think is wonderful. <br /> <br />If you have never given Jane Eyre a chance, try it with this movie.  I don't think you'll be disappointed!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The scenery was great in this movie.  It really takes you back to the era depicted in the movie.  The acting was also very good.  The plot itself was well thought out and kept slowly evolving throughout the movie. Then again, fiction or non-fiction period pieces are usually presented in this matter.  It seems the Illusionist (played by Edward Norton) had everything figured out. But did he? Check this movie out to find out.

I just don't believe that you could be thinking wrong, whatever that is, and get into a car accident as the book suggests. I think driving with your eyes closed would definitely cause you to have a car accident. Please people,alot of people drive to work in a coma half the time and make it to work somehow. Maybe, it's me, but it seems it is one more of those ideas that gives someone the idea they have more control over their life than any of us actually do. If you have a friend who thinks like that and you want to give them a gift of this book by all means do it has a nice appearance,it has a padded cover, glossy pages and short little excerpts great for that someone on your gift list.
055358202X|4.0|Maybe the previous reviewers only say they've read the other three volumes, but in truth have not. Martin has taken the story exactly where it needed to be taken. If he doesn't write from the perspective of Brienne, Cersei, et. al then they simply become bit players and they are too important to the overall story to play small roles. This makes absolute sense to me and I'm having a hard time understanding the negative reviews. Yes, he leaves us hanging. So what. He could've included what amounts to the second part of this book, but who cares. Stephen King has cut novels in pieces and nobody complains plus his writing isn't half as good. I'll buy into the too many characters complaint, but that's a minor quibble. I enjoyed reading the perspective of the people you love to hate. Martin went exactly wher he needed to go. Can't wait for the next volume.

0143036556|5.0|It feels particularly pleasant when you enjoy an author you've never read. It's like meeting a new friend you can connect like you do with your best.  <br /> <br />That's why the RM60-ish bucks I spent on Jared Diamond's monumental Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive felt like a bargain. From Easter Island to China to Montana to Greenland, Diamond records the environmental characteristics of these places, outlines their brief histories and offers theories on their environmental catastrophe, whether in the past (for Easter Island, the Anazasi, etc.) or in the (quite scary) future (e.g. China, Haiti, Montana, etc.). <br /> <br />There are epic-like accounts of people like, for example, the Vikings and why some of them established long-lasting communities in places like Ireland but why others failed to stay very long in Greenland (one of the bizarre reasons was that the Viking simply refused to eat fish, something speculatively, but quite plausibly, attributed to a bad experience with seafood back in Scandinavia!).  <br /> <br />The book also helps as an introduction to the modern histories of countries like the Dominican Republic and Haiti which are located on the same island(!) but  have widely diverging environmental situations (they were both corrupted but one of DR's early leaders established a legacy of protecting the country's forest - why? Maybe because one of his early guardians instilled a sensitivity towards nature when he was a child...) <br /> <br />The book's audacity and \\"magnitude\\" is a fruit of Diamond's experiences around the world. What I would give to step into his shoes for a while (grin). What does it feel like to spend more than two decades circling the globe, analysing environmental problems, diagnosing ancient societal collapses, knowing full well that your next book will be a best-seller (even if the first 50 pages - on Montana - are a little rough-going)? How do you become an expert on disciplines as diverse as geography and psychology? <br /> <br />Smack in the midst of spiritually cramming city life, amazing how a book on mother nature and how people have used and treated her throughout the centuries can help inspire and steady one's thinking. One thing about living in a reasonably urbanised, media-intoxicated place like Kuala Lumpur: there's not a lotta genuine direction. Too much media, hype, \\"big time\\" dreams, hedonism, pride/ego trips and absolute mind-loads of distraction. <br /> <br />People like Diamond and their personal journeys are, in this context, much-valued add-ons' to the day.
B000K7UBTI|4.0|Wastrel billionaire playboy Tony Stark flies to China when his top employee and best friend is kidnapped by a group of modern day ninjas.  The ninjas are trying to stop a Stark Enterprise-funded raising of an ancient Chinese city and, potentially, the re-animation of a fabled evil-doer named the Mandarin.<br /><br /> People are taking their comic book heroes very serious nowadays, and this shot-for-video includes a helpful \\"The Origins of Iron Man\\" featurette that more or less clears up the things I'd forgotten about ol' Shellhead.  Just in time, too, since a big screen, live-action movie is planned for release in the summer of 2008 - a little over a year from when this review was written.  Anyway, in the original origin story Tony Stark was injured while in Vietnam, shrapnel in or near his heart or something like that, and he needed an iron lung-type medical device to stay alive.  In INVINCIBLE IRON MAN they drop Vietnam, keep Asia, the chest wound and the custom-cut iron suit.  The other big change in the story, according to the featurette (and some less-than-happy blog postings I've read recently) is the Armor Room, hidden deep in Stark Enterprise's headquarter, which holds the Underwater suit, the Outer Space suit, etc.  Apparently the suits changed slowly over time, and the Armor Room represents a type of heresy - Tony Stark did NOT create all those suits at once before he was even Iron Man!  Which may be true, but the multitude of suits allow Iron Man more costume changes than a Follies chorus girl during a Saturday matinee, and if they aren't true to the comic book history they probably make the action figure manufacturers happy enough.<br /><br />  Fidelity to the source, in this case, doesn't matter that much to me.  When they raise that Chinese city, with inflatable steel, no less, four Elementals are awakened.  They, in turn, must locate five rings to awaken the big boss Mandarin.  All that stands between them and that unimaginable horror is Iron Man.  What does matter to me in an animated action comic book is plot and action.  The plot, they have to find five rings in five distinct quests, would fit well in a video game (really, this feature is a marketer's dream) and otherwise does adequate, if not spectacular, service as a plot.  The action - Iron Man battling the Elementals at each stage before squaring off against the big boss - were pretty well done.  I didn't know they were mixing CGI with 2-D animation, but they do so here with middling results.  The Elementals, representing Earth, Ice, etc. are your typical air-borne meanies with the special ability to control different elements.  Some of the footage of the Elementals was computer generated, and it shows.  I'm not the target audience for a movie like this, but as someone who remembers Iron Man from his 1960's and 1970's comic book incarnation, I am someone the film makers hoped to appeal to.  If you fall in that category INVINCIBLE IRON MAN might not thrill you, but it won't disappoint you, either.an.  What does matter to me in an animated action comic book is plot and action.

1400079276|3.0|If you don't like avant-garde-ish stuff, don't read this book. If you think postmodernism is of the Devil (or just very lazy messed-up minds), don't even bother opening this book. If you think philosophy is a waste of time, don't even go near Murakami.  <br /> <br />Because he has characters quoting things like: <br /> <br />\\"The pure present is an ungraspable advance of the past devouring the future. In truth, all sensation is already memory.\\" (Henri Bergson) <br /> <br />\\"At the same time that 'I' am the content of a relation, 'I' am also that which does the relating.\\" (Hegel). The girl proceeds to expound the phrase: \\"Hegel believed that a person is not merely conscious of self and object as separate entities, but through the projection of the self via the mediation of the object is volitionally able to gain a deeper understanding of the self. All of which constitutes self-consciousness.\\" <br /> <br />A page later, a guy who's the embodiment of Colonel Sanders (a'la KFC) chides a truck-driver:  <br /> <br />\\"A revelation leaps over the borders of the everyday. A life without revelation is no life at all. What you need to do is move from reason that observes to reason that acts. That's what's critical. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about, you gold-plated whale of a dunce?\\" <br /> <br />Now get this. The Bergson and Hegel quotes/remarks are smack in the middle of a love scene and made by a college girl prostituting herself for tuition money. Her client was the truck-driver. Colonel Sanders was the pimp. <br /> <br />I'll be honest: I DIDN'T 'GET' THIS BOOK! I'm not aware of any conventional-sounding reason for Murakami writing this. Like sound bytes which sound good (if a little awkward), it's like one big collection of provocations, 'mysteries', pseudo-connections - and just too bad for coherency. <br /> <br />I enjoyed SOME parts of it and Murakami has a way of drawing you in, enticing you to read more. But in the end, I'll be honest, I felt a little cheated. I felt like that whale cum dunce. And I likely won't think of KFC the same way again.

That said, I liked him here!  When he's playing the role of a regular Joe, he's likeable!  I felt bad for him near the end!!  When he's being real, he's good.  When he's being funny, well, let's just say I'd rather hear knock knock jokes all day then see him do a comedy!!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|This documetary was absolutely fascinating and very well executed in every way. That being said, the only thing that was a slight disappointment was that this masterful filmmaker either couldn't or chose not to cover the entire breadth of the career of this truly compelling artist. It covers only the 1960's; granted the time when Dylan was at probably at the peak of his creative powers, but that is only equal to about 1/4 the whole story. At a running time of almost 4 hours, I personally would have liked to see a more complete portrait of the man & his life. That is my only complaint, though. I can still say this film was nothing less than absoluetly riveting and one of the best documetaries I have ever seen and probably ever will see.

1401301010|3.0|Although I've liked the RHCP for a long time, I'm not a *big* fan. I saw them live in 1989 and was surprised at how lousy they were. We left before the show was even over. Still, I liked their records before and after. I like these tell all books and really enjoyed the Motley Crue book (and I'm not a fan) so I was hoping for something similar. Although AK's life has certainly been more interesting than most, his stories get tedious. For the better part of the book, its 2 pages about a new girl he could be with for the rest of his life, a drug binge, getting clean, a new girl, a binge, getting clean. Just over and over. By the ending chapters I couldn't believe I was reading about another drive downtown to score drugs. Nevertheless, I give him credit for talking about his life so frankly, and I found his always-up spirit a little inspiring. I started to wonder if his everything's-beautiful attitude was responsible for his success. The whole group really seemed just determined to destroy their fragile career. AK fans will rave, RCHP fans will say eh...

0743289684|4.0|The word \\"oppression\\" is often misused, but describes perfectly the effect of Islam on women.  They must submit absolutely to their fathers, husbands and even brothers.  Arranged marriages, honor killings, genital excision, beatings, headscarfs and body coverings, and more, all to keep the women totally subservient.  While I previously knew many of these things, the book is remarkably effective in giving them real meaning for those living in the West.    The book is also a compelling and candid memoir by a highly intelligent, courageous and remarkable woman.  Raised dirt poor in Somolia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya, she managed to become fluent in English, as well as Somali, Arabic, and Swahili.  After landing in Holland to escape an arranged marriage, she learned Dutch, earned a master's degree in political science and and became a member of the Dutch parliament.  Her description of culture shock when she arrived in the West shows how much we take for granted.  The book tells the story of her journey from Muslim to apostate (a capital crime in many Islamic countries).  A major theme is how multiculturalism (however well intentioned) in Western countries has the effect of isolating Muslim immigrants and perpetuating the abuse of Muslim women.  For that and other blasphemous behavior [see Submission, Part I on the Internet], she lives under constant death threats.    I bought the book after seeing Ms. Hirsi Ali speak on C-Span.  She was dazzling, showing an appreciation of Western values and traditions that would put 95% of Americans to shame.

B000H5V8DG|5.0|If you're an Alias fan you NEED this collection! We already know the show is great, but the presentation here is just AWESOME!!! The Rambaldi artifact box is way cool. The lid lifts off and then the sides (which are held in place with magnets) fall out. Each season of disks are held in individual little  books. The best part was the false bottom that I didn't even know about when I purchased the collection!! What a fun surprise! There's an 'extras' disk underneath the books when you lift out the false bottom that has interviews from back when they shot the pilot, footage from the last episode and SO MUCH MORE. So glad I waited to buy until I could get all 5 seasons together like this!  You won't be disappointed with this purchase!
B000FZETIO|2.0|Pretty in Pink, an 80's teen dramedy may have a FEW worthy moments but it's mostly full of hot air. While I'm a HUGE fan of 80's teen movies (and 80's movies in general) this one definitely did next to nothing for me.  <br />The premise is simple: Molly Ringwald plays Andie, a high school senior who'll be graduating in a month. What sets her apart is the fact that she's poor and comes from a family of a lazy father and a mother who left them. Though she is poor, her home is typical middle class and her stylish clothing make her look a lot richer than she actually is, perhaps to hide the fact that she IS poor. Whatever. Her best friend Duckie is in love with her but doesn't want to ruin their friendship. Andie falls for a cute, but rich, guy at school (played by Andrew McCarthy). This new rich boy is envied and disliked by Duckie and is too much of a coward to stand up to his hoyty toyty rich best friend who doesn't wants to date Andie but is too much of a rich snob to snag her. He's mad so he tells his best friend to avoid her.  <br /> <br />Anyways, the typical senior prom happens at the end where Duckie realizes he only wants for Andie's happiness and she ends up chasing her crush out and kissing him and the movie ends.  <br /> <br />What's most annoying about this movie is the lameness of the characters. They just aren't very interesting. And when you think things are getting good, they do for a few minutes before the film drags along once again. This movie would've definitely been great if not for the complete lack of chemistry everyone involved had. Sure, there are tears and confusion, but you don't really care because these characters simply ACT OUT the script, you don't get the feeling at all that they're real people with real backgrounds. 99% of the time the ONLY interest they show in their lives is in their given situation. The ONLY time any character shows any type of human character is when Andie remakes her prom outfit because she's really into sewing and fashionable clothing. This doesn't add anything to the story except come in where it's handy. And even then it isn't handy cause the only reason she resewed her prom dress was cause her dad went out and bought one and said \\"i know you may not like it, but i know you can do something with it.\\" she might as well have just gotten one herself she liked and that would've been the end of it.  <br /> <br />bottom line: a cookie cutter teen drama/comedy that starts nowhere, adds filler, and ends nowhere you care about.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine is a common anomaly on [...]. Some films can't be critiqued with whole number. Case in point, Little Miss Sunshine. It deserves better than a four, yet isn't quite good enough for a five. Althouth it often successfully combines madcap comedy with heartwrenching drama, there are times when the two genres cancel each other out, and some of the dialouge is plain corny.     The Hoovers are the very definition of \\"Dsyfunctional\\". The mom and dad sometimes fight like vicious dogs, the uncle is suicidal, the teenage son is mute, and the grandfather swears constantly and snorts crack. The only normal one is the seven-year-old daughter Olive. But then things really begin to spiral out of control when Olive is accepted into a prepubescent beauty pagent called \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" in California. The family piles into their battered old Volkswagen and move out.    I should really only mention the flaws because everything else is near perfect. First, Paul Dano (the son, Dwayne) is really great with facial expressions and emotion. But when talking normally, he isn't as convincing. Then there's a glaring factual error. The mother says the grandfather (Alan Arkin) snorts heroin. Thing is, you can't SNORT heroin. He's clearly doing cocaine. Next, the third act at the pagent really gives off vibes of pedophillia. That's no good. At last, the script. Its very well written, but was that much cursing really neccesary? I swear, 50% of what Paul Dano says is the F word. Whats the first thing he says when he finally starts talking? [...]!!!!!!!!!    So Little Miss Sunshine isn't a perfect movie. But if your in the mood for a bittersweet comedy/drama, your in luck.
B00005JPLU|5.0|300 is a visually stunning film adaptation of writer-artist Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 which is essentially a retelling of an important historical event during the Greco-Persian War.  This event is the Battle of Thermopylae which took place in 480 B.C. where 300 Spartans lead by King Leonidas took a stand against the massive forces of the invading Persian army (which was estimated to be between 200,000 and 2,000,000) lead by the God-King Xerexes.    Being that the movie the 300 is an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel do not expect this movie to be a totally accurate depiction of everything that took place during the Battle of Thermopylae.   For instance there are a few monstrosities on the Persian side to aide in making things even more interesting than the standard type of battle you would expect to see in a film like this.        Also the battle wardrobe for the Spartan heroes is something else that isn't accurate.  Their battle wardrobe is barely existent (cape, Speedo, helmet, sword and shield) and no I'm not complaining.  I'm just pointing out the fact that it's certainly not the sort of battle uniform the Spartan army would have worn during a real battle being that it offers very little protection for the heroes.  To me the \\"so called\\" battle wardrobe that is present in the movie is a plus especially if you're a woman or an appreciator of the physical beauty of the well toned male form.  Also if you don't care for all the violence in the film then you might find looking at the heroes' abs, ripped biceps, and sculpted chests, and muscular legs to be a very good distraction.      On the other hand if you're not interested in the heroes' washboard abs, ripped biceps, sculpted chests, or muscular legs you also won't be disappointed either because there's plenty for you to delight in as well.  This movie delivers on the blood-gore.  You can consider this movie to be an uncensored ancient battlefield being that the director shows the gruesomeness of war in all its bloody details. This movie also features plenty of well choreographed battle sequences.  You won't find any of the amateurish action sequences or confusing direction of the action as seen in the film Alexander or Gladiator.  This is topnotch stuff equal to Mel Gibson's work in Brave Heart, Wolfgang Peterson's work in Troy, or Peter Jackson's work in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.      If these elements aren't enough for you still or if none of the aforementioned things appeal to you then you will also find that this movie offers plenty of topless women for men to stare at or others who enjoy seeing bare female [...].  There are larger than life heroes featured in the film to be captivated by.  Men who are loyal, brave, selfless, strong, well-trained, and honorable and a queen who is as equally strong as her husband King Leonidas.   There are also well done special effects which create this ancient-dangerous world in a stunning fashion that is sure to please many.    Story-    King Leonidas played by Gerard Butler learns news that Xerxes has amassed an army of millions to conquer mainland Greece and eventually all of Europe.  Instead of simply surrendering to these invaders King Leonidas decides to bravely face possible death to fight for Sparta's freedom.  Being that he has decided to go to war he seeks out  the Oracle.  Unbeknownst to him the priests of the oracle have already been bribed by Xerexs and so they interpret the oracle's message to mean  that King Leonidas should not go to war because it will interrupt the Carneian festival.    Realizing that it makes sense to act now King Leonidas decides to take a small band of men:  300 Spartans,  some Arcadians, and other Greeks to meet the Persian invaders at Thermopylae which is a narrow valley adjacent to the sea.  They choose to meet the Persians here because it allows them to block the only road that the massive, multicultural army of slaves lead by Xerxes could pass through.  It also allows the Spartans to use their much smaller army in the most efficient way.  Their wonderful military strategy naturally leads to heavy losses on Xerxes side so he sends out his best against them, his personal bodyguards the immortals (who in the movie appear to be masked creatures).  They are also unsuccessful at beating the Spartans.  Things begin to shift in the Persian favor only when a traitor gives them crucial information.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is the best Bond movie in such a long time. More emphasis on characters, and less of unreal technology. I don't know know why people have a problem with the plot... it's closer to the original story than most of the other films(Casino Royale was the first Bond book written, in case you care). <br />If Moonraker was your favorite Bond film, then maybe you won't dig it. If you want super suave Bond, then you might not like it either... this is when he is just starting his 00-career, and he's a lot rougher around the edges. <br />I only give the DVD 4 stars, because it seems like there could have been more to the extras... I didn't see any missing/cut scenes, and I think it would have been nice to have something talking about the original book, blah, blah, blah. <br />Either way I hope you enjoy the film.
B0007TKH66|5.0|I have been able to view those episodes that I had not previously seen or had forgotten.  The DVD quality was good.  There were several digital dropouts of the video on the first disk.
B00005JPLU|2.0|I admit I was duped. My cousin was in town and wanted to see this film. I was (or still am to some extent non regarding his turn to fanatical right wing opinions) a fan of many of Frank Miller's graphic novel and comic works, and also was curious about the hype. I saw the film, thought it was decent (though Zack Snyder I did not know directed the movie, remade one of the best films of all time, which is blasphemy in my eyes (Dawn of the Dead)), and went on my merry way. Then I thought a bit more. I already thought the whole perfect army of white skinned grecians (not very historically accurate) with perfect biceps and six packs seemed suspicous (if not a little homoerotic). Plus the Persians (all black or african american actors) seemed a bit stereotyped against (despite the controversy with Iran, as this review will detail, their complaints about the film don't even scratch the surface). Add in a strange subplot about a traitor who is a hunchback (and rejected from joining the \\"300\\"), a gay \\"Xerxes\\", and the fact that the Spartans practiced extreme Eugenics (probably a bit exaggerated in this film), I realized I was watching a racist, jingoist film extolling virtues more in common with Aryan Nations than ancient Greece. It got more and more scary the more I thought about it. Hitler was against \\"decadent\\" Weimar era Germany, and the Persians are seen as \\"decadent\\" in this film. Wow. Is this a neo nazi film? Likely not. But there is something sinister about a lot of these elements when played against one another.<br /><br />I'll admit it. I enjoyed the film. But it seemed alot more like \\"guiltily\\" enjoying \\"Triumph of the Will\\" with my jewish ancestry than watching and enjoying say, a Kubrick picture
B000LE1GVW|4.0|Already hailed as the new James Blunt, the debut album from this 19-year-old singer-songwriter is an assured affair with polished production by Ken Nelson, the same producer of well known acts such as \\"Gomez\\" and none other than \\"Coldplay\\".  <br /> <br />His name may be Italian, but Paolo Nutini was born and bred in Paisley, Scotland. Though he's already popular in England; Paolo influencers aren't the traditional Brit-pop favorites one might have come to expect, instead he turns to vintage soul and R&B, citing the likes of Ray Charles, Ben E. King and even Van Morrison. His soulful inclinations are more than apparent on tracks like \\"Last Request,\\" while jazzy leanings creep on songs like \\"New Shoes\\", where his soulful voice packs real conviction. <br /> <br />More acoustic arrangements come in the form of \\"Rewind\\" and \\"Loving You\\" which make this album certainly appropriate for a laid back coffeehouse setting, easy-listening radio stations, and one which should also strike a chord with college and university students everywhere. <br /> <br />Just like newcomer James Morrison on his wonderful debut album \\"undiscovered\\", Nutini sounds mature beyond his years and his rich vocals score high marks. Interestingly enough, they both sound somewhat reminiscent of James Blunt, and in Nutini's case, this is more than evident especially on songs like the piano tipped \\"Autumn\\" and the falsetto-laden \\"Million Faces\\". <br /> <br />All in all, there is no doubt that Paolo Nutini has the right attributes to be a very successful solo artist by clearly favoring a classic troubadour approach in his official debut album, pushing all the right buttons; and connecting with enough invention to warrant immediate attention and curiosity as to how this determined fresh face will develop in the near future. Not bad for a 19 year old whose original dream was to play soccer professionally as a goalkeeper and who landed a job as roadie, T-shirt salesman and occasional opening act for a friend'sband at a mere 16-years-old !! <br /> <br />
0790729369|5.0|...and to perhaps never recognize you found it indeed, but until way past its time. This is what this beautiful movie is all about. Soulmates eternally searching and loosing each other in an endless sucession of human lives, happen to cross each other's path one day, in the middle of nowhere. No one expected it to happen. No one seeked for it to happen. And yet, all surroundings (including family and social conventionalisms) are bound to become mere accidents. And love fulfills itself. A love, so brief and yet so meaningful and powerful that will be forever treasured in their hearts. Like a candle that lits only as they encounter. Isn't this the stuff all tragedies, dreams, dramas and everlasting love stories are made of? This beautiful, beautiful movie perfectly showcases Clint Eastwood's uniqueness as a Director, a trademark he will carry on all the way up to masterpieces like \\"Mystic River\\" or \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". Such a deep and profound touch that reaches people's hearts. The product of a genius in the making. I loved it.
B000MM1F5A|1.0|Love the music--live is much better than the earlier album--however--it cannot be downloaded into an MP3 player.  that means I will never be able to listen to it.  I think the small mindedness of this technical limitation will keep Mariza from being a global star---don't buy this CD.  it is a crime

B00004Y6NK|5.0|I love this CD. It's from the `80s, but it doesn't sound \\"dated\\" to me. It's just good sounding music. It features Eric Clapton on vocals and tasty guitar, Nathan East with his funky bass guitar lines, Phil Collins with his diverse and heavy drum beats, and the creative keyboard melodies of Greg Phillinganes. Highlights for me are \\"Run\\", \\"Tearing Us Apart\\" (A duet with Tina Turner), \\"Hung Up On Your Love\\", \\"Miss You\\", \\"Behind The Mask\\", and \\"Grand Illusion\\".   I actually bought this CD after watching the \\"Eric Clapton & Friends Live 1986\\" DVD, which I also recommend. It features several of the songs on this CD.  For optimal listening pleasure, I recommend the re-mastered version of this CD. Big sound, good songs.

B000M341QE|3.0|I'm not quite as enthusiastic about this movie as a lot of other people seem to be, including those who were on the Oscar Nominating Committee. It doesn't give the viewer the sort of realistic fly-on-the-wall eavesdropping vantage point that movies such as \\"Good Fellas\\" did. This movie is more about style. It keeps you running after each showy, bloody panel, trying to piece them all together and make make some sense of them. <br /> <br />Admittedly, Scorsese probably aimed at keeping audiences guessing who's-who right along with the characters. But the viewer is confronted with additional layers of confusion here. We are constantly challenged to guess not only the real identity of each character, but why it matters. And Matt Damon and Bernard DiCaprio are shorn to look very much alike, so you even have to stay alert to distinguish them. I don't know if their two-sides-of-the-same-coin appearance was intentional.  <br /> <br />So there aren't many places where you can simply allow yourself to be absorbed into the film. One of the few exceptions to this is the scene most often used as an advertising clip for \\"The Departed\\" - the scene in which Nicholson and DiCaprio engage in a tense cat-and-mouse conversation over a pub table. These moments will draw you in. But for the most part, this movie will probably leave you on the outside looking in, trying to figure out what's going on, or admiring the bravado turns of the individual actors. You may admire, for example, Jack Nicholson's sheer panache as he appears out of a back room spattered with blood, banters a bit, issues a few commands, then returns to - ahem, whatever it is that is occupying him in that back room. <br /> <br />But in general, this movie is hard work. You can't just settle back with a bag of popcorn and let it lift you out of your usual labors. I felt that I might understand its twists and turns of identity better if I watched it through a second time. However in the end, I just didn't think the movie was worth the trouble.  <br />
B00006EXL5|5.0|totally origional and isnt any mainstream stuff. deff 4 all current or new MCR fans
B000LC55F2|3.0|This movie suffers from attention deficit disorder. There is hardly a scene in it that lasts more than 20 seconds. It's now here - now there - now somewhere else. <br /> <br />Some of this technique may have been a purposeful attempt to present the viewer with a parallel to the magician's trick of now-you-see-it, now-you-don't - no, the coin isn't in my hand, it's behind your ear! But this movie goes too far with that sort of disjunction. It ends up like a jigsaw puzzle spilled out of the box onto the floor. There's no process or coherent character development here. So it's hard to get emotionally involved with the lives of the competing magicians. <br /> <br />Admittedly, \\"The Prestige\\" has a lot of ground to cover. There are a lot of tricks and counter-tricks to present, a lot of deals and deles. To get all this material in and to retain some sense of the journey as well as the destination, the movie would have to have been much longer, something that many directors/producers presume current audiences won't tolerate. <br /> <br />I had at least looked forward to seeing how the famous real-life wizard, Nikola Tesla, was portrayed here. However, I was somewhat disappointed on this score too. As fantastic as many of Tesla's experiments with electricity actually were, his results are carried to absurd extremes for the purposes of this plot. The movie veers off into sheer implausible science fiction when it comes to Tesla. <br /> <br />Also, there is something a little jarring about Christian Bale in the role of one of the competing magicians. One expects a magician of that sort to be gaunt, angular, satanically shadowed - and Bale appears a little plump for this stereotype. Or maybe it is just that Bale had taken himself down to such extreme emaciation for his haunting portrayal in \\"The Machinist,\\" that his fleshed-out appearance here clashed with expectation. <br /> <br />But the movie does have an intricate plot with some challenging twists and turns. <br /> <br />\\"The Illusionist,\\" was a movie that came out at roughly the same time as this \\"Prestige\\" and had a similar theme of pre-modern magicians. \\"The Illusionist\\" had what was perhaps a slightly more predictable denouement. But it was more satisfying in that it took its time with texture and unfolding. If these two movies could have been combined somehow, with the cagey plot of \\"The Prestige,\\" and the sipping amber loveliness of \\"The Illusionist,\\" we would have had one magical movie.  <br />
B000068QVN|5.0|I forgot how great Grand Funk are until I bought this CD on an impulse. GF was my first live concert (and that means I have a soft spot for this Trio). This live recording sure showcases the bands talents well. I'll wager the music will bring back a flood of memories and emotions if its been awhile since you listened to them. Extremely period sounding record. Its hard to explain. Coupled with the \\"old fashionend\\" stage remarks made by Mark Farner (I imagine) sure bring me back. \\"..Working all day to make a nickel bag.\\" When was the last time you heard that phrase--man?  A very out-a-sight recording. A time capsule.
B00003CXDG|3.0|I think it took me two seeing to realize how yucky this movie was; there was so much that was wrong. I think the first thing that we notice is that this is not about the Impossible Mission Force, but Tom Cruise.  So, aside form the name, the music, and the jargon, this has nothing to do with the classic show.<br /><br />This was a let-down.  Leonard Nemoy in \\"I Am Spock\\" mentioned that he loved the teamwork aspect of the series.  I agree: there was something about Mr. Phelps and the IMF all piling into the getaway van and the classic Mission: Impossible recessional theme that let you know that there was a job well done because each member did his part.  Like the guy said, \\"The greatest temporal and spiritual blessings which always come from faithfulness and concerted effort, never attended individual exertion or enterprise.\\"<br /><br />Another problem was the physics.  The cycle-jousting forgets that when two objects traveling at 50 mph a piece collide, the cumulative force felt by them is not 50, but 100 mph.  Talk about being jelly!  And the gun in the sand: how does kicking it forward make it go one and half meters vertically into the air?<br /><br />This film has plot, in the sense of having action, or a series of events.  But did I mention the plot holes?  How did Cruise happen to have a Richard Roxburgh mask so handy? I guess it was next to the handy duct tape.  And how did they change clothes so quickly?<br /><br />Yes, there is conflict: Cruise versus the Aussie, and Cruise versus the supermodel supertheif. The theme is not so obvious. There are messages about courage, duty, and self sacrifice. These are helpful, but seem to be mere distracting tinsel.<br /><br />Being John Woo, this film is essentially about style. This is good for artists who have plot, theme, and characterization, and would like to perfect their craft.  As a standalone attribute, however, this film leaves something to be desired. Anyone who has been on a date knows that looks only go so far.  And the same applies to movies.<br /><br />*<br /><br />The transfer is perfect, and they get one more star for including the Ben Stiller spoof, \\"Mission: Improbable.\\"ly go so far.

B00004UEDQ|4.0|This movie is another in a pretty formulaic cadre of from committed boozer and dope addict to drug free recovery stories.  This movie does have the virtue of being genuinely funny in some places.  Best of all  this movie does not take itself so seriously that the anti-drug message dominates the movie.  The Movie has a strong anti-drug message make no mistake about that but it is not preachy, high toned, condescending or overly moralistic.<br /><br />I do not agree that this movie protrays all teenaged ladies as vapid, self absorbed, trite peices of fluff unable to avoid the snare of drug abuse or addiction.  However if you go to a football stadium during a football game most of the people you will see there are football fans.  Likewise if you have a movie set in the teen ladies unit of a drug treatment center you will see mostly teenaged ladies who for whatever reason were unable to beat the lure of low life dope dealers.  The fact that a small faction of teen aged young ladies end up on the crazy road to drug drained boozed up palookaville does not in any way take from the fact that most teen aged young ladies become awesome contributing members of society.  28 Days wants to be a movie that zooms in on life for a small fraction of teen aged ladies who have surcumb to the evils of dope and booze and are on the road to productive recovery.<br /><br />Despite the serious subject matter what makes this movie fun, is the cast of odd ball characters on the druggie unit with the main character.  You just know by looking at this druggie program that it is populated with the posh more well to do upper crust crowd and their is nothing wrong with that.  Everyone is just slightly off kilter just enough to be interesting yet still beleivable.  I have found most dope addicts and boozers have their weird quirks.  It is said that what most in society consider an eccess of weirdness is the price paid by those whose level of inspired creativity allows them to think outside the box in chosen life pursuits.<br /><br />In the case of the main character as with so many creative types, she aches to be accepted by mainstream society.  Her pleas to be loved by polite society go unrequited as thinking outside the box creatively has become a pain for which drugs and or booze become her crutch.  One of the funniest parts of the movie has to be when her enabler boyfriend brings booze, a cheap diamond and his stupid boozed up - pro-druggie ideals to her on a boatride while she is in the treatment center.  This guy was such a TOTAL UTTER LOSER, while he sounded sincere in his every word he was also a sad black comedy because, there are really people out there who think exactly like him.<br /><br />28 Days (Special Edition) is a good DVD because despite its heavy subject matter it is still a \\"very entertaining movie\\".  Good fun solid Entertainment is something most druggie \ boozer finds redemption flicks usually do not do very well.  28 days is funny, entertaining while still holding on to its strong anti-drug message.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|This second release in the, now well and truly underway, neil young archive series is an absolutely perfect document of a fascinating period in neil's career.    It's intersting to note that my review is the 36th submitted so far... and every single one of them has awarded this release 5 stars... it really is that good! not a single person has wavered from that perfect score.    The ideal rainy day cd, this solo show is a tender, intimate, and immensely focused performance from neil. Every rendition is stunning, and the sound quality is crystal clear.
0974872407|5.0|I tryed but I couldn't put it down.  The story traps you dances and tangles with you till the end of the book. First time I read Carlos Ruiz Zafon and probably won't be the last, I loved his writing style, inviting, flirting, easy, fresh, envigorating.  This book is a keeper.
B000I5X80G|4.0|The first thing i want to make clear about this release is the issue of why 'Cinnamon Girl' was not included. <br /> <br />There were no remaining high quality tapes of that song. Rather than release second rate audio along with other high quality stuff, neil decided to only put out the material and recordings that were of the highest quality. For this i commend him. He has always done things his way, and i respect the fact that he has elected for quality over quantity on this occasion. <br /> <br />Others have shown concern that none of the acoustic material was included. Any of those concerns can be forgotten now that neil has released the second live performance in his archive series, the absolutely stunning acoustic performance from massey hall in '71. <br /> <br />All that said, this is a quality recording of a band in its early days. Spirited, aggressive and a joy to listen to. Although not the 5 star release that the new 'Massey Hall' show is, this is nevertheless a fantastic document. <br /> <br />Looking forward to many more neil young performance archive releases. Hopefully every couple of months as we have been treated to so far!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Other than the original Jane Eyre with Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine, this most recent version is really excellent. Toby Stephens performance is excellent, you believe him to be Mr. Rochester not an actor. He gave Rochester's character more personality and humor.  Ruth Wilson was excellent as Jane and again brought more to the character.  The Haunting music and the spin on some of the story was refreshing.  The scenery and all the characters were wonderful.  I have seen many versions of Jane Eyre, this is my favorite.   <br /> <br />It is truly a love story that makes your heart palpitate and smile at poignant moments.  It is done with style.

1400064287|5.0|This will be the best business book I'll read all year. I know that already.  And if you need to communicate with other people (who doesn't?), it may be one of your top picks also. <br /> <br />Made to Stick has the telling subtitle, Why some ideas survive and others die. The main thesis is this: there are ways to package your ideas that allow them to stick in the minds of your audience. Building on a key concept (\\"stickiness\\") from Malcolm Gladwell's seminal book, The Tipping Point, authors Chip and Dan Heath uncover the anatomy of ideas that embed themselves into the minds and hearts of people. <br /> <br />The book is clearly written, very approachable, and filled with memorable examples that, of course, exemplify the main intent of the book. The principles outlined are nothing earth-shatteringly new, but they are presented in such a way as to provide a practical call to arms for more skillful and creative expression. <br /> <br />According to the authors, communication that sticks needs to maximize simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotional connection, and the use of stories. When you think of some of the world's best communicators, you see the fingerprints of these practices all over their preserved productions. <br /> <br />This is a passion of mine - distilling down to the core idea and expressing it well, whether in writing, public speaking, teaching, or any other format. I see this skill as the key success factor in creating good branding - but I think the principle applies equally to training, copywriting, and even parenting. I recommend this book highly to anyone who seeks to communicate more effectively (hermits, therefore, may wish to explore other titles...!).
0307237699|5.0|I knew Barak Obama has extraordinary charisma and extraordinary eloquence.  I read this book to learn more about him, to learn if there was substance behind the eloquence and charisma.  I was astounded by the wisdom of this man!  He has a deep understanding of the broad economic, political, legal and social movements in this country in a historical context.  He writes about them with clarity, simplicity without sacrificing accuracy, and without vitriolic polarizing language.  I learned a great deal about many governmental programs in recent U.S. history, how they came about, who proposed them and who opposed them.  Amidst this intelligent discussion is interspursed the most poignant personal details.  He is a man who not only loves his country but deeply loves his family and community.  There is an argument that Barak doesn't have enough experience.  I strongly concur with those that say that judgment trumps experience.  Barak has extraordinary judgment.  He has wisdom. Exceptional wisdom.  Reading this book was sunshine amidst the despair of present politics.  He gives me hope, audacious hope.
B000E41MRC|5.0|_Triumph of the Will_ (in the original German:  _Triumph des Willens_) is the most infamous propaganda film featuring the Nazis at the Third Reich's 1934 Nuremberg Party Rally by the notorious German film maker Leni Riefenstahl.  The movie obviously centers around the Nazi fascination with the all-powerful \\"Will to power\\" and attempts to show what can be accomplished by application of such Will to the political.  The film features such Nazis as Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels, Rudolf Hess, and Hermann Goering but most of its focus is directed at Adolf Hitler (\\"Der Fuerher\\").  The basic point of the film seems to have been to propagandize for the National Socialists showing Germany as a great power and the strength of the German military and people.  The film also features appearances by the S.A., the S.S., and the \\"Hitler Youth\\", all praised by Hitler himself.  Most of the film consists of marches by the German stormtroopers, accompanied by music from Richard Wagner (beloved of Hitler) and the \\"Horst-Wessel-Lied\\" or party rallies with speeches by Hitler himself or other notorious Nazis.  The movie also shows much of the accompanying scenario of Germany at the time as well as featuring a scene in which farmers dressed in traditional garb present the fruits of their labors to Hitler.  Such appeals to tradition were common among the Nazis.  Throughout the film, the German male soldier/worker is presented as youthful, exuberant, strong, fertile, and powerful.  (Some of the scenes involving young German men frolicking, shaving, and even bathing while bare-chested could probably frankly be described as homoerotic.)  Hitler's speeches themselves (as well as the speeches of the other Nazis presented in this film) are powerful and disturbing.  Hitler explains his position and attempts to demonstrate the power of his party and nation.  At one particularly revealing point, Hitler states \\"the state does not order us, we order the state!\\".  At other times, various Nazi officials express the fact that \\"Hitler is Germany\\".  This sums up the cult of personality surrounding Der Fuerher.  (Hitler's uncanny ability to mesmerize the people during his speeches has been commented upon frequently.  Some have maintained that Hitler himself has an almost occult influence at such times.  Various theories have been suggested to explain how he came about such powers.)  Ironically, at no point in the film is a single anti-semitic phrase uttered.  This may have been intentional.  What can be seen from this film though is the power of the Nazi state and military.  Further, the esoteric elements of the Nazi party are present, including such features as the swastika and the bizarre cult surrounding the \\"blood banner\\" (the flag carried by the Nazis during the Beer Hall Putsch and revered by Nazis since that time).  Many have noted that the Nazi party itself may constitute a form of ersatz religion.  For example, the conservative theorist Eric Voegelin (who himself escaped from Germany at the time) has maintained that Nazism constitutes a \\"political religion\\".  Such quasi-religious aspects are certainly present in this film.  Ultimately though, to me at least, the film pointed out the lurking danger that may be found in all crowds and group-think.  Such a \\"herd instinct\\" overtakes many of those present in the crowd as their very selves merge with the rest of the crowd, the party, the nation, and the German people in pseudo-mystical union.  Thus, may be understood the mystical aspect of the National Socialist movement, and herein, partly lay its appeal. <br /> <br />The woman who made this film, Leni Riefenstahl (1902 - 2003), was an interesting enough person herself.  To begin with, one must note that for the time, this film represented an advance in film technique.  Indeed, the entire film is very well put together and effectively accomplishes its purpose in propagandizing for the Nazis.  Riefenstahl herself was a German film-maker who became fascinated by the Nazis for a time.  Later, she was to maintain that she was politically naïve and largely ignorant of the sorts of crimes they were committing (whether or not she was being disingenuous on this point is obviously debatable).  After World War II, Riefenstahl was kept in a French detention camp for some time.  She was investigated for a period but never convicted during the de-nazification process.  Later, she would continue to produce other works of art, but ultimately she remains most (in)famous for this piece. <br /> <br />The movie itself is a disturbing one, ultimately, in light of the crimes of war.  It speaks to the danger of fanaticism.  Ultimately, despite the propaganda presented in this film, Hitler did not serve the German people well, and was to betray them at the very end (when many innocent Germans were butchered by Soviet soldiers).  This is to say nothing of course of Hitler's other, more notorious, crimes. <br />

0517548232|4.0|This book is not for those of you that have already done a lot of economics. It's probably too basic to be very useful for you, but it can for sure be a very useful lesson for those not schooled in the area.<br /><br />It thoroughly stomps quite a few common misconceptions the common man has about economic policy and its consequences, so for that I applaud the book. Some people find it too simplistic and harsh, but this book, like Hayeks \\"A road to serfdom\\", were written in a time where these truths were not very well known, so a loud voice was needed. (And probably unevitable considering the frustration great minds like Hayek must have felt when he saw what governments were doing, considering what he believed to be the best course of action.)<br /><br />And for those of you that say it is dated: Read it again, with an open mind. None of the principles are dated, and as he notes a couple of times, history has a bad tendency to repeat itself; not much has changed in the way politicians handle economic issues since this book was written. (Sure, many details have changed, but a thorough understanding still often seem to be lacking.)

B000M341QE|5.0|After watching The Departed I pretty much knew that this was the movie that would finally win Martin Scorcese an Oscar for best director.  The Departed is basically a distillation of all of the themes and techniques that Scorcese has been exploring since the mid 70's.  Honor, loyalty, and crime are all in The Departed.   His quick and creative edits, fast paced dialogue, apt placement of music, and quick burst of violence are also present.   <br /> <br />So there was a tremendous sense of the familiar when I watched The Departed.  The only thing that was really different is that there are no longer Italian mobsters like in Goodfellas and Casino, but Irish cops and Irish mobsters.  But The Departed is hardly just a rehash.  You can tell that Scorcese's job is making movies, but he definitely loves his job.   <br /> <br />The Departed follows the exploits of two main characters; Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a cop who has been placed undercover inside of mobster Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) organization, and Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who is a mobster that has been placed inside of the Massachusetts State Police to act as informant for Costello.  The two men work against each other at every turn, and they both engage in a cat and mouse game to try and outwit the other. <br /> <br />The interaction between the characters is based around the duality of each role.  Costigan is acting like a tough thug even though he is a cop who comes from a decidedly middle class background.  Sullivan is a mobster who has been working for Costello ever since he was a kid but looks and acts like a straight laced, clean cut young cop.  As the movie goes on, both men have a hard time maintaining the roles that they are playing.  Costigan begins to show his vulnerability and have panic attacks and abuse Oxycotin, while Sullivan makes some attempts at being a legitimate citizen.  He gets engaged to a police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga), and expresses a desire tostart over in a new city and become a lawyer.   <br /> <br />The performances are uniformly good throughout the movie.  DiCaprio puts in the best performance of his life playing Costigan and was robbed by not being nominated for an Oscar.  The subtlety, paranoia, and desperation DiCaprio puts in to the role have you really feeling for his character.  His performance ranks up there with Pacino's Frank Serpico as desperate and paranoid cop performances.   <br /> <br />Besides his role in the Talented Mr. Ripley, this is probably the most evil character Damon has ever played.  His performance is no where near as dynamic as DiCaprio's, but he is mostly convincing as Sullivan.  Nicholson mostly hams up his performance as Costello, but it adds some comic relief to the movie.  He had me laughing out loud when he was sniffing around like a rat and when he comes out of a back room with his hands covered in blood.  The dark house of the movie is Farmiga, who's character Madolyn is vulnerable, confused, but strong at the same time.  She is in love with two men who lead false lives, but she tries to stay genuine and authentic throughout.   <br /> <br />This isn't even mentioning the performances of Mark Wahlberg, who plays the abrasive Sgt. Dingnam, Martin Sheen who plays Captian Queenan, or Alec Baldwin who the quirky and high strung Captain Ellerby.  All three put in great performances as well. <br /> <br />The music is also a high point in the movie.  The well placed Dropkick Murphy's tune I'm Shipping Up to Boston adds an interesting sense of dread to the movie.  The rest of the music, even the score is also very effective.   <br /> <br />This movie is highly recommended and ranks of one of Scorcese's best films.  He may not be breaking any kind of new ground with The Departed, but he keeps refining his craft and is on top of his game.    <br />
B0000630BT|5.0|>>>>>>Not many bands have mastered the art of deception, that is creating two or more different kinds of music (classic metal, thrash) that are very different from each other. When fans listen to their favorite bands' music, after a few seconds they recognize what band it is, whether it be AC/DC, Ozzy, Led Zeppelin, or Iron Maiden (just to list a few examples). However, what we have here within the sheer glory that is \\"Painkiller\\", is quite a surprise, but nonetheless a welcome change. In fact, you wouldn't know you were listening to the same classic metal band, Judas Priest, that gave their fans such hits as \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\", \\"British Steel\\", and \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\". Seriously, when the crazy, manaical, opening drum solo burst through my speakers, I had to double-check what band I was listening to, cause it could have passed as a Lamb of God or Shadows Fall piece. Now if that's not talent(making their music sound COMPLETLELY different then what we're used to), then I don't know what is?<br /><br />Many people have deemed \\"Painkiller\\" heavy-as-hades, but at the same time cheesy. If you ask me, \\"Painkiller\\" is sparse on the cheesiness and loaded with heavy metal madness, complete with crunching, heavy riffs, blazing and lightning-fast solos, and powerful vocals from one of metal's finest recruits. Now, I knew Halford had a terrific voice (hearing all their other classics and all), but his performance on this cd further magnifies his greatness, as he soars with the screeching high notes and growls his way through riffs such as on \\"All Guns Blazing\\", \\"Hell Patrol\\", & \\"Metal Meltdown\\". If I didn't know any better, I would guess he was right in the middle of his prime, which was a whole 10 years before!!! And it's not just him.<br /><br />>>>>>>>The whole cast is full-throtle with no holds barred. Scott Travis makes his debut on this album, and man he must have had SOMETHING to prove, 'cause he rips the floor up with his quick footwork and tears the skins W/ his complex hands. Downing and Tipton are phenomenol and are possibly in their best form, delivering wrist-workin' riffs on tracks like \\"Leather Rebel\\", \\"Metal Meltdown\\" and the title track. Their solos are incredible and full of toxic energy, something you wouldn't expect this late in their game.<br /><br />Really, you can't go wrong with this album. From the ear-splitting opener to the somewhat epic closer and very catchy \\"One Shot at Glory\\", this cd gives the listener a more than ample bargain. Other hits include the haunting and keyboard infested \\"A Touch of Evil\\" on which Halford dishes out some amazing vocals and really grabs your ears. Also, the catchy and guitar-driven \\"Night Crawler\\" and the underrated \\"Between the Hammer & the Anvil\\" add a lot to this metal masterpiece as they contain some screechin' solos and delicious vocals from Rob. All in all, every song is a work of art, that deserves to be heard! Buy \\"Painkiller\\" along with ALL of the other Priest goods! 'Cause when the Priest calls, you must answer.s W/ his complex hands.

B000002GQG|4.0|Though it doesnt contain a song like the epic beautiful \\"nights in white satin\\" the Moodies second album from 1968 is their most pyschedelic and solid album of their career. This album segues nicely into a track by track tour of what the end of pyschedlia and the beginning of progrock sounded like. There isnt really a song i dislike and this fits in nicely with the best of the post summer of love albums. Lots of flute mellotron sitars and instruments played by the band themselves. Lost chord is a very strong followup to days of future passed and exceeds it in material for me. Great acoustic guitars and truly great singing all mingled in with LSD musical interludes( though apparantly without drugs). A few moments recall early Pink Floyd late Beatles etc but the Moody Blues were a special band for a time-1967-1972 in my humble opinion. Their first three albums are all excellent but this is the one to get. This one seems heavily influenced by George Harrison Ravi Shankar- with most of the album flaoting by a in a mellow transcendental state. Great for evening listens sunday mornings and for contemplation.
B000J6I0VG|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and adults.  I always dread buying some of the more recent kids movies for my Niece and Nephew, but this one was a lot of fun to watch with them.
0618680004|5.0|I have loved the writings of Richard Dawkins for years.  His clear, understandable writing style makes reading his books so interesting.  Now his new book takes on the topic of religion, especially that of the monotheistic God, presenting both well-known and not-so-well-known arguments against the existence of God.  His discussion of the anthropic principle and why it is an argument against God instead of for him made for fascinating reading.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|Clapton has evolved and is writing good songs that reflect maturity both musically and personally. I have seen Clapton live and it is this newer material in which he shines and plays the most passionately.This album is mostly soul/blues songs mixed with a few acoustic numbers.All are well written and Clapton's guitar comes through distinctly and soulfully.The best songs with classic Clapton guitar solos are One DAy and Run Home to Me.For me I like to hear lyrically soulful songs reflecting something real like longing and family and then have Clapton apply his guitar expertise bringing these songs to an emotional head.For those longing for the old Clapton--it was and is great material--but the man has evolved--
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Very strong, well-acted, compelling work which weaves together 4 disparate story-lines a-la 21 Grams (which Inarritu also directed.) If you've seen 21 Grams, or Crash for that matter, and enjoyed them, you will enjoy this one. I would call it a \\"global-Crash\\" and it works about as well as that one did within the confines of LA. Babel, as the title somewhat confusedly suggests, is about things that draw humans apart (racism, classism, national suspicion, arbitrary geo-political borders, broken families, distance) and those things which tie us all together in spite of these barriers (family ties, human love and mercy, vows, economic interests, etc.) It's difficult to share how this all plays out without giving away the way in which the 4 stories collide, but suffice it to say that the ending is satisfying and worth the ride. - blogophobe -
B000LC55F2|5.0|This was the most amazing movie I have seen in sometime.  I loved the mystery that was not revealed until the last scene.  I bought the DVD because it's one I will watch again and again.
0393324818|4.0|Very insightful, journalistic account of how Billy Beane, the General Manager of the Oakland A's, synthesized a lot of other peoples' ideas (Bill James in particular) to field a baseball team that could compete with and beat the NY Yankees for 1/3 the cost. The author, Michael Lewis, is primarily a financial writer and has previously penned gems like Liar's Poker. But he was interested in Billy Beane for the same reason people write about Steve Jobs; he's innovative, he takes risks, and is wildly successful most of the time. Even if you don't like baseball, this will be one of the most mesmerizing books you will have read in quite sometime, but as a baseball fan - I was entranced. - blogophobe -
B000MNP2KI|4.0|The plot of CASINO ROYALE is indecipherable but, hey, who cares? Just sit back and enjoy the action and Daniel Craig's new Bond. While I haven't seen all the Bond movies, long ago turned off my mindless gimmacry and adolescent sexuality, I will declare this the best Bond movie ever made. Mr. Craig, his rough-hewn face looking sculpted from too many times barroom fights, is a perfect Bond or at least is the Bond Sean Connery should have been: quiet, tough and no nonsense, all the clever Bondisms absent from the script, giving CASINO more of a sense of reality than previous Bond films. The long, opening foot-chase scene is stunningly choreographed. Hats off to director Martin Campbell for excellent production values and filming. Judi Dench is good as Bond's boss and Eva Green as his love interest. One hopes there will more Bond movies with Mr. Craig as the lead. There is one more new Bond movie fan.
B000LXH0AE|3.0|Very creative and satisfying staging, filming, and casting. The director should get kudos for having the moxy to cast Queen Latifah against Emma Thompson, with Will Ferrell as the dramatic lead - this took guts, and surprisingly, it works most of the time. The basic idea is that Will Ferrell's life is a character in a novel that is being written by Emma Thompson and he has to discover who the narrator is, and then how to make contact. Dustin Hoffman (who I personally think is somewhat overrated as an actor - he plays almost the same character in every film) gives a credible role as an English Prof who asks Will Ferrell literary questions to help him discover who the narrator is. The director uses some interesting props and very well-designed sets to make this far-fetched concept seem marginally believable, very witty, and generally satisfying.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I absolutely love this collector's edition. The delivery was prompt and delivered a day before the due date which was a nice surprise! I wasn't aware the conversion to AU Dollar, but it was certainly well worth it! Great purchase!
1416914285|5.0|Can I just say firstly; I stayed up until 1.30am last night/this morning because I \\"only\\" had 75 pages left to go and surely that wouldn't take too long? I just couldn't tear myself away from the book by that stage. To me, that's always a sign you're on to a winner.  <br /> <br />I initially went in to the book fairly sceptically, knowing the author's background and for reasons unknown to me now, decided I didn't want to like the main character, Clary. Until this happened (edited to remove spoilers): <br />\\"How did you know? Was there some way you could tell?\\" <br />\\"I guessed\\" [Jace] said \\"It seemed like the most likely explanation.\\" <br />\\"You guessed? You must have been pretty sure, considering you could have killed me.\\" <br />\\"I was ninety percent sure.\\" <br />\\"I see,\\" Clary said. There must have been something in her voice, because he turned to look at her. Her hand cracked across his face, a slap that rocked him back on his heels. He put his hand to his cheek, more in surprise than pain. \\"What the hell was that for?\\" <br />\\"The other ten percent.\\" <br /> <br />And that was the exact moment I fell in love with Clary. She's fiesty. And yet not perfect. She's a good role model for a young girl, without being unrelatable. She makes mistakes and has embarrassing moments and it's very endearing. <br /> <br />Another aspect of the story that I loved was the fact the characters swear. They're fifteen and for me, this added a realistic and gritty edge to the dialogue that I feel many other teen novels are lacking. I cannot think of another teen novel that is quite this effectual, realistic and compelling out there for this target group.  <br /> <br />I'll finish the review with a final point; that the book is clever. The plot is well devised and interwoven seemlessly so that the reader gets no clues until it's time to figure it out. The writing is smart and the vocabulary used is obviously deliberately chosen to extend a young reader's knowledge and not spoon feed themwith explanations and unneccessary descriptions. The book is aimed at intelligent young readers and adults alike and very enjoyable.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Saw the movie for first time today (03/18/2007).  I can't add anything to that which has been already said.<br /><br />1. I'm getting myself a copy of the DVD<br /><br />2. I'm getting a copy of the book - so I can see what's missing<br /><br />Five stars for this one!!
B000ICL3KG|4.0|An Inconvienent Truth is one of those eye opening doccumentary type films that makes you realize that all we take for granted can be taken away due to our ignorance, greed and unwillingness to change. As I watched this DVD chills ran through my spine. The proof is overwhelming, mankind is destroying the earth's ability to sustain human life. What really astounds me is that I purchased a vehical that runs on Ethanol and due to the greed of the oil companies, I can't buy it here in California. This is further proof of the greed of the powers that be at any cost regardless of the consequences. The bible says that \\"unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved.\\" (Matt 24:22) It also says that God will destroy those destroying the Earth. (Rev 11:18) This movie enforces the truths of those scriptures by revealing scientifically just how close we are to destroying our planet, if we haven't already reached the point of no return without divine intervention.

B000069KE0|4.0|Early Chicago varies vastly from the bland and faceless outfit that delivered a string of hits during the 80s. In contrast to that limp outfit, the Chicago of the late 60s and 70s was an energetic jazz-rock band that few could match. The first few albums were edgy and vigorous, combining the horns of Blood, Sweat and Tears with the acid-rock guitar of Hendrix. In addition, the early years were tremendously fertile: the first 3 albums were all double-LP sets. Following 1969's wild Chicago Transit Authority, 1970's Chicago (aka Chicago II) takes a decidedly poppier direction and employs various \\"suites\\". How well does this work? <br />The first five tracks are the most conventional pieces. All four are relatively poppy Chicago songs, with  harmonies, horns and guitar work `a plenty. Nothing too tremendously outstanding, but nothing odd. <br /> <br />Then, we reach the 15 minute \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon.\\" However, the CD breaks the ballet down into several pieces. We start with \\"Make me Smile,\\" a blustering song with big horns, fast jazz rhythms, well-executed vocals and chorus, and of course, excellent guitar work. That then segues into shorter pieces like \\"Anxiety's Moment\\" and \\"West Virginia Fantasies,\\" which are pretty much variations on that first track's motif. We then go to \\"Colour My World,\\" which is a good song caught in the middle of all this. This is followed by \\"To Be Free,\\" and the ballet concludes with \\"Now More Than Ever,\\" which is pretty much a reprise and a conclusion to \\"Make Me Smile\\" All this reeks of prog rock excess, but its delivered in a surprisingly tasteful manner. Clearly, this is meant to be the centerpiece of the album. <br /> <br />The next songs are more conventional, with nothing really comparing to the awesome \\"25 or 6 to 4.\\" Man, that track rules. Crazy rhythms, powerful horns and Terry Kath's mind-blowingly awesome wah-wah solo. It's a classic in and of itself! <br /> <br />The last side is comprised of two rather dour songs, and one of them, \\"It Better End Soon,\\" is split into four parts. It doesn't work as well as the ballet, but its still a good experiment. <br /> <br />Overall, if you're keen to the idea of meshing horns with loud guitars in a daring and tasteful way, check out the album. The main reasons for buying this album are clear: The beauty of the ballet and its primary components (\\"Make Me Smile\\" and \\"Colour My World\\"), and the monstrously awesome \\"25 or 6 to 4.\\" The rest of the material makes for a pleasant listen, but nothing truly scales the heights reached by those compositions. As a result of the disparity between the best and the rest,  chose to give this album 4 stars. <br /> <br />Again, if you like pop-rock but want a dab of horns and urgency, try this out. If you're looking for something more even more adventurous than that, purchase Chicago Transit Authority.
B000KGGLCU|4.0|I saw Madonna's Confessions Tour concert live in Boston on July 6th, 2006.  This DVD was a great representation of the concert experience I saw first-hand.  It highlights a lot more of the Material Girl than what I was even able to see live.  There were so many things going on all over the stage at any given moment and this DVD allows me to see some things I missed at the concert I attended.  The DVD is absolutely worth the purchase price.<br /><br />The CD, on the other hand, was somewhat lacking.  Yes, it had the more famous songs on there, but it was missing other songs that I liked, such as Forbidden Love.  Otherwise it was quite good.  I think they could have had all the songs on the CD, perhaps in a two-CD format.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Madonna, especially her Confessions on a Dancefloor album.  I will admit, I was not a big Madonna fan until her confessions CD came out.
B00003CXUM|5.0|Wong Kar-Wai's \\"in the mood for love\\" is, as its title suggests, a study of this human experience we call love. But is not, unlike the title (which alludes to a famous western love song and western loves songs are elemental to the plot) and its surface plot line suggests, limited to romantic love. It does, in fact, depict the lifeline of a seemingly tragic unconsummated love affair but in the process of this exploration meditates on a range of human emotions and feelings and ways of being. I say seemingly tragic because although the lovers do not live \\"happily ever after\\" and the hero rides off into the sunset alone they are both, in fact, liberated from illusory existence in the process. Furthermore, the film considers what it is that constitutes love be it romantic or altruistic; examining such aspects as sincerity, truth, concern, loyalty, trust, honesty, and, of course passion. It is a study of the roles that we mortals and fortune play in our different relationships both as individuals and members of society. And, echoing \\"Casa Blanca\\" it is a buddy flick to boot; staged during the turbulent East of the sixties. His friend, although a comedic sidekick, is also a somewhat pragmatic earthy confidante who serves a drunken master/monk's role. This symbolic image is repeated towards the end when a Buddhist monk is the sole witness to our hero whispering his secret to the mountain. The extended ensemble of neighbors and workmates that serve as boundary lines, backdrop and compass points are also major cast components. Even French President, Charles De Gaulle and Nat King Cole make significant appearances via documentary footage and soundtrack. The film is informed by both Zen Buddhism and post post modern physics both in regards to the space/time continuum it explores as well as the cinematic techniques employed to do so. The freeze frames and blurs employed to punctuate and slow \\"reality\\" were especially effective as were the chapter titles and soundtrack. But moreimportantly the plot and dialogue themselves serve to simultaneously focus and distort to more accurately depict reality as evidenced by the role playing that isn't role playing as well as the mirrored images. \\"in the mood for love\\" is a meditation on how to be both in love and in life and it makes the point that we are by what we do and in the process, if lucky, we be.
B00005MP58|5.0|I've owned this edition for more than 3 years now, watched it for probably 20 times or more, and like all the others who reviewed this below my one complaint was that it didn't have subtitles... or so I thought!!!  Some weeks ago I discovered by accident that it did!  You won't find the subtitles under the DVD menu... <br /> <br />... you have to TURN ON THE CLOSED CAPTION OPTION of your television or DVD player! <br /> <br />Most of our TVs have a menu of some sort where you set the contrast, color, audio, etc. (consult your TV manual)  I had turned on the closed caption setting for another video and forgot to turn it off.  Days later I popped in this video to keep me company while doing the laundry, and when I looked up from my work I was shocked to see letters at the bottom of the screen!  I thought the laundry detergent was making me hallucinate! <br /> <br />Finally, after *years* of straining to hear what Mr. Hurst mumbled at the end of the breakfast scene where Mr. Bingley had invited Elizabeth to stay, I now understand what he said and why Mrs. Hurst was so vexed: \\"Is there any sport today or not?\\" <br /> <br />What I do not know is if all TV models have a closed caption setting.  I could have sworn I tried it at my parents' home when I first got this 3 years ago and was desperate for the subtitles, but nothing showed then and I foolishly gave up trying it on other TVs.  Although it could have been because I had it on the wrong setting.  Some TVs have more than one option under Closed Caption.  For instance, the TV here at my house has CC1, CC2, CC3, Text1, Text2, and Off when you select the Closed Caption menu, and the subtitles for P&P came out with CC1 selected. <br /> <br />If you're playing the video on your computer, check if your DVD player software has a closed caption setting.  My computer uses DVD Play.  It has a Closed Caption setting with only On and Off as the options and it works fine there, too. <br /> <br />I hope it works for you, so you canrediscover this wonderful TV series all over again, just like I am now more than 20 viewings later!:)
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Pride & Prejudice is simply a great romantic movie. As a \\"male\\" movie viewer <br />I was skeptical of the ability of this movie to draw me into it's story.

Geoff Emerick, EMI recording engineer, \\"demystifys\\" the Beatles persona and offers both an insightful as well as technical view of the Beatles as musicians during their recording sessions at Abbey Road studios.

B00005JPLU|3.0|I am not a big comic book fan, but I am a lover of ancient history (Greece in particular), so I was very interested to see this film. <br /> <br />With that being said, my impression after leaving the theater was that this film was ancient history meeting \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Kill Bill\\", sponsored by Mountain Dew and Bowflex and shown Friday night at 11:30 on Cinemax. <br /> <br />I liked the original film \\"300 Spartans\\" much better. <br /> <br />

B000MNP2KI|4.0|I've been a bond fan since my childhood, and I've seen all the bond films. Through it all I think I've changed the way I liked how Bond was played, there was a time I thought Pierce Brosnan would be the ideal Bond when he was chosen. Now a little older (wiser maybe? hehe) I appreciate Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig's version a lot better. Here Bond is more real and not some cartoonish playboy with cheezy one-liners. Bond is an assasin and Daniel Craig's bond doesn't give us any doubts about it. Watch the film and enjoy the different breeze coming into the franchise. It's all good.

1582701709|2.0|I am commenting on The Secret as a clinical psychologist who specializes in how cultural and spiritual beliefs affect health as well as the author of a book about converging science and mysticism to navigate our personal journey. First, The Secret is a compilation of opinions from a group of professionals in several fields, rather than a book by the author. It would be more accurate for Ms. Byrne to present herself as the editor, rather than the author of the book. Having said that, it is important to distinguish between wishful thinking and mind-body science. Although the concepts expounded in the book are beautiful examples of what we could achieve if we explored our potential, it leaves the reader with \\"feel-good\\" platitudes, by failing to convey that simply wishing something does not attract anything other than expectations that lead to disappointment. As a scientist, I have seen the mind bypass biology in miraculous ways, but this does not happen by just wishing and waiting for \\"the laws of attraction\\" to work. Instead, change requires honoring commitments, not blaming others for our failures, assessing the self-sabotaging that surface when self-esteem is compromised, and realistically defining goals.<br />The success of this book shows how hungry we are for someone to tell us that change happens magically without having to confront our demons and without taking responsibility for the life we created with our actions.<br />While I wish Ms. Byrne the greatest success, I want to caution the reader that if \\"wishful thinking\\" does not attract what you want, do not blame yourself, because it was only thoughts without action.

0374105235|5.0|I would be lying if I said actual content of this book was in line with the great contemporary writers of our time.  (However I believe the author has tremendous potential in that area.)  What is appealing about this book and keeps the pages turning is the realistic nature of the vocabulary and human connection with the author.  The subject matter is important and may only reach people when presented in such a personal manner.  No matter how versed you are in world news and the human condition, you will find yourself thinking \\"my God, I can't believe this happened.  I can't believe it is still happening.\\"  Read and it and pass it on.
0743454537|4.0|This book is a terrific read.  Great story, well written, and interesting.  The primary plot of the book is obviously the most interesting and thought provoking.  SOme of the sub-plots were a little cheesy and unnecessary.  However, the sub-plots take up very little of the book.  Definitely read this book.
0937381888|5.0|This book serves several purposes well. For the absolute beginner who is anxious to brew his first batch and to brew it right, this book helps give him a good shot at succeeding. And for the beginner with a little more patience, who wants to really understand all of the basics, including the how-and-why of all aspects of brewing, the ins and outs of the ingredients, etc, before making his first attempt, this book serves that purpose well, too. The book is so full of great information that you'll probably find yourself referring back to it over and over again as a reference. <br /> <br />The first half or so of the book covers all of the basics of beginning to intermediate homebrewing in a nicely layed-out, readable format. The last half of the book, which gets into the more advanced method of all grain brewing is more complex, but well-written and full of great information also.  When tackling complex topics, Palmer usually breaks the discussion into two separate chapters: a practical chapter that tells you what you really need to know, and a more theoretical one that really gets into the technical details. This lets you skip all the technical details if you are not interested, without missing all of the good practical advice that can make a big difference in your results. <br /> <br />The appendices are very useful, too. One appendix, for example, covers many of the typical problems that may be encountered when homebrewing, what their causes are and how to fix the problem the next time around. It is a very practical guide full of useful information. <br /> <br />If you want a book that gives good detailed practical instructions as well as very readable explanations of the how-and-why of homebrewing, I'd say this book is an excellent choice.
B000LAZDQA|3.0|I have yet to see a sexually explicit film in which the sex acts explicitly depicted within were integral to the plot or furthered the story along (Romance, Baise-Moi, Raspberry Riech, 9 Songs).  Such is the case with Shortbus. Granted, if you take away the sex scenes you still have an interesting story (hence my three star rating).  But if the story can stand alone with out the explicit sex then why bother putting it in? This film could have been just as effective with simulated sex scenes or even implied sex scenes.  For me, the explicit sex took away from the story and seemed to be a contrived shock factor ticket selling ploy from Mitchell who probably couldn't top the sheer brilliance of Hedwig. I was also disturbed that no one in this film practiced safe sex. It's irresponsible and shocking on the actors and director's part.  I am all for films that explore sex and sexuality. It can be (and has been) done successfully without show the  sex acts or the \\"money shots\\". I'm no prude but I think explicit sex should remain in porn films, not a mainstream movie trying to pawn off it's sexual explicitness as \\"art\\" or \\"true cinema\\".

B000M3452Y|5.0|...make you really, really glad you're a music fan.  'sound of silver' is one of them.<br /><br />the opener, 'get innocuous,' is one of the best dance tracks i've ever heard. it's sexy, hypnotic, and seductive. the beats are tight and addictive. and it's got great vocals, including the icy 'you can't normalize, don't it make you feel alive' that arrives 1/2 way through the song. 'north american scum' is a natural follow-up to 'daft punk is playing at my house.' it displays more of murphy's trademark wit with lines like 'to those of you who still think we're from england, were not. no.' great delivery on that one.<br /><br />my favorites are 'someone great' (taken from their 'nike original run') and 'all my friends.' the former is a synthy number with lots of nice bleeps and blips and the later a piano-driven stomper not that far removed from something off of new order's 'technique.' it may be the best thing he's written to date.<br /><br />simply put, i 'sound of silver' is a lot of fun.  and that's what makes this such a great album.  in a world where too many bands lack a real sense of fun and adventure (and take themselves way too seriously), lcd soundsystem reminds us that music can--and SHOULD--be fun.  it's the album that makes you wish you were 17 again, carefree, out all night with friends, crushing on the girl riding shotgun, and still optimistic about the future.
0385483821|5.0|The real value of this book is that it is written by someone, Andrew Grove, who has actual experiences and managed a start-up right up to a mega successful corporation. There are tons of management and marketing books written by people, based on case-studies and analysis, but lack actual experiences managing or working in a corporation. <br /> <br />The main concept of this book is on strategic inflection point, which is a time in the life of the business when its fundamentals are about to change. This change can either infer an opportunity to rise to new heights or signal the beginning of the end. Hence, this book is about the impact of changing rules, guidelines to assist in identifying those situations and about finding your way through those uncharted territories. This book serves to raise our awareness of going through cataclysmic changes and to provide a framework in which to deal with them.  <br /> <br />This book uses Porter's competitive analysis strategy in terms of the 6 forces as a base. The 6 forces are <br />1. Power, vigor and competence of existing competitors <br />2. Power, vigor and competence of complementors <br />3. Power, vigor and competence of customers <br />4. Power, vigor and competence of suppliers  <br />5. Power, vigor and competence of potential competitors <br />6. Power, vigor and competence of substitutes <br /> <br />Once a very large change happens in one or several of these 6 forces, a \\"10X\\" force is in effect. Very often the transition from a normal business environment to that of a \\"10X\\" business environment is very gradual and thus, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact time in which the \\"10X\\" force came about. Strategic inflection point comes about when this balance of forces shifts from the normal environment to that of the new \\"10X\\" environment and it is difficult to pinpoint its exact occurrence. <br /> <br />The circumstances that help to identify this strategic inflection point are <br />1. Presence of troubling sense that something is different such as changes in customers' attitudes, entrant of new competitors, etc. <br />2. Growing dissonance or misalignment between corporate statements and operation actions. <br />3. Emergence of new framework or actions. <br />4. New set of corporate statements is generated. <br /> <br />Andrew gave an analogy of working your way though a strategic inflection point to be just like venturing into the valley of death, the perilous transition between the old and the new environments. It is difficult to know the right moment to execute the appropriate actions. Since timing is everything, it is attractive to undertake these changes when the company is in a healthy financial state. This means \\"acting when not everything is known, when the data aren't in.\\", merely relying on \\"instinct and personal judgments\\"  (Chapt 2). Hence it is a matter of training your instincts to pick up a different set of signals. <br /> <br />The only way we know whether a change signals a strategic inflection point is through the process of clarification that comes from broad and intensive debate. This debate should involve technical discussions, marketing discussions and considerations of strategic repercussions (how will it affect our business if we make a dramatic move; how will it affect if we don't?).  The more complex the issues are, the more levels of management should be involved because people from different levels of management bring completely different points of view and expertise. The debate should involve people from outside the company, customers and partners with different areas of expertise and interests. When dealing with emerging trends, you may very well have to go against rational extrapolation of data and rely instead on anecdotal observations and your instincts. (chapter 6). Constructively debating tough issues and getting somewhere is only possible when people can speak their minds without fear of punishment. <br /> <br />Andrew offers a few guidelines to discern \\"signal\\" from \\"noise\\" <br />1. Is your key competitor about to change? Suggested using the \\"silver bullet test\\": If you had just one bullet, whom among your many competitors would you save it for?  When the answer to this question stops being as crystal clear, it is time to sit up and pay special attention. <br />2. Is your key complementor about to change? Does the company that in the past years mattered the most to your business seem less important today? Does it look like another company is about to eclipse them? If so, it may be a sign of shifting industry dynamics. <br />3. Does it seem that people who for years had been very competent have suddenly gotten decoupled from what really matters?  If key aspects of the business shift around us, the very process that got us where we were might retard your ability to recognize the new trends. <br />Generally you cannot judge the significance of the strategic inflection point by the quality of the first version or release of the product. You will need to draw on your experiences to discern its possible impacts. <br /> <br />Strategic dissonance is the divergence between actions and statements; saying one thing and doing another. Strategic dissonance is an automatic reaction to a strategic inflection point that probing for it is perhaps the best test of one. <br /> <br />Clarity of direction, which includes describing what we are going after, as well as, describing what we will not be going after, is exceedingly important at the late stage of a strategic transformation. This book defines strategic plans as statements of what we intend to do, whereas strategic actions as steps we have already taken or are taking. Strategic plans are abstract and are usually couched in language meant for the company's management. Strategic actions matter because they immediately affect people's lives. The most effective way to transform a company is through a series of incremental changes that are consistent with a clearlyarticulated end result. <br /> <br />This book mentions the \\"Taillight\\" approach - some companies may profitably wait for others to test the limits of technological possibilities or market acceptance and then commit to following, catching up and passing them.  <br /> <br />A question that often comes up at times of strategic transformation is whether you should pursue a highly focused approach, betting everything on one strategic goal or should you hedge. It takes every erg of energy in your organization to do a good job pursuing one strategic aim, especially in the face of aggressive and competent competition. It is hard to lead the organization out of the valley of death without a clear and simple strategic direction. Demoralized organizations are unlikely to be able to deal with multiple objectives. Thus, hedging is expensive and dilutes commitment, and is not recommended. <br /> <br />\\"Most companies don't die because they are wrong; most die because they don't commit themselves... The greatest danger is in standing still\\" (Chapter 8). <br />   <br />The leader needs to show interest in the elements leading to the strategic direction, by getting involved in details that are appropriate to the new direction and by withdrawing attention, energy and involvement from those things that do not fit. At times like this, the calendar is the most important strategic tools in communication. Andrew emphasizes that communicating strategic change in an interactive exposed fashion is important and necessary such as corporate email announcements and meetings, etc. <br /> <br />Companies that successfully navigate through strategic inflection points tend to have a good dialectic between bottom-up and top-down actions. Bottom-up actions come from the ranks of middle managers, who by the nature of their jobs are exposed to the first whiffs of the winds of change, who are located at the peripheral of the action where change is first perceived  and who catch on early. But by the nature of their work, they can only affect things locally. Their actions must meet halfway the actions generated by senior management. While those managers are isolated from the winds of change, but once they commit themselves to a new direction, they can affect the strategy of the entire organization. The best results seem to prevail when bottom-up and top-down actions are equally strong. When the top management lets go a little, the bottom-up actions will drive towards chaos by experimenting, by pursuing different product strategies, by generally pulling the company in a multiplicity of directions. After such creative chaos reigns and a direction becomes clear, it is up to senior management to reign in chaos. A pendulum-like swing between the 2 types of actions is the best way to work your way through a strategic transformation. What is needed is a balanced interaction between the middle managers, with their deep knowledge but narrow focus and senior management, whose larger perspective could set a context. <br /> <br />An organization that has a culture that can deal with these 2 phases - debate (chaos reign) and a determined march (chaos reined in) is a powerful, adaptive organization. Such an organization has 2 important attributes: <br />1. It tolerates and even encourages debates. These debates are vigorous, devoted to exploring issues, indifferent to rank and include individuals of varied backgrounds. <br />2. It is capable of making and accepting clear decisions, with the entire organization then supporting the decision. <br /> <br />This book emphasizes on the concepts by reliving a few of Intel's crisis; the mid-80s shift from memory to microprocessors business, RISC vs CISC architecture and during the fall of 1994 the floating point bug associated with Intel's flagship device; the Pentium processor. The magnitude of this crisis is so significant in that a tiny flaw in the microprocessor's floating point unit could mushroom into half a billion dollars' worthof damage in less than 6 weeks. This was later narrowed down to 2 key factors. First the success of Intel's merchandising \\"Intel Inside\\" program, which has projected a strong Intel image right to the end-user, became a double-edge sword in that end users directly contact Intel for a replacement microprocessor. In a normal incidence, it is likely to be the computer manufacturers who will perform the recall and replacement. But Intel's identity is so strong with the end-users that they became the ones asking for a recall and replacement. Second, the other factor is attributed to Intel's sheer size. Intel had become gigantic in the eyes of the computer buyers. And thus the huge cost in replacement.   <br /> <br />This book also relates the transition of the computer industry in the 80s vertical alignment to that in the 90s; the horizontal alignment. This came about with the appearance of the microprocessor and then the personal computer. The \\"10X\\" force came about when the technology permitted the integration of several chips into one single chip and this same microprocessor enabled the production of all kinds of personal computers. As the microprocessor became the basic building block, economics of mass production worked its charm giving extremely cost-effective PCs. Over time, this changed the entire structure of the industry and a new horizontal industry emerged. As a result of this trend, companies previously successful in the vertical alignment, but who failed to adapt or recognize this \\"10X\\" force failed and no longer existed today. Examples are Wang and Cray. At the same time, this change also spelled opportunities for new entrants such as Dell and Compaq. Thus when an industry goes through a strategic inflection point, the practitioners of the old industry may have trouble, while on the other hand, this new environment provides opportunities for new entrants into this industry. <br /> <br />The key characteristics of horizontal industries is that they live anddie by mass production and mass marketing, bringing cost-effective solutions and more specialization, i.e the best in class for that particular market segment such as TV monitors, memory, storage devices, etc. <br />  <br />The new rules of the horizontal industry are  <br />1. Do not differentiate without a difference. Do not introduce improvements whose only purpose is to give you an advantage over your competitor without giving your customer a substantial advantage. Example is a \\"better PC\\" departed from the mainstream standard and hence giving rise to software incompatibility. <br />2. Grab opportunity when there is a technology break or change coming along. <br />3. Price for what the market will bear. Price for volume. Work like the devil on your costs so that it becomes profitable. This leads to economies of scale whereby by being a large-volume supplier, you can spread and recoup those costs. In contrast, cost-based pricing will often lead you into a niche position. <br /> <br /> <br />To be a leader or survivor in a horizontal and commoditized industry, this book provides some food for thought. A prime example is Intel exiting the commoditized memory industry in which they were once in the lead, until the entrance of the Japanese manufacturers.  <br />
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Less concentration on the miseries of her youth, more attention to the relationship with Mr. Rochester.

0815411839|4.0|It is hard to imagine the kind of painstaking research that went into creating this comprehensive work of exquisite detail.  Spoto not only captures the unique essence of MM's engaging personality, he includes the minutiae of her life experiences to such a degree that even someone who did not grow up surrounded by her iridescent image would feel a part of this era.  Especially interesting are the intricate details of her early life, which would later so greatly affect her vulnerable psyche.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what put me off were the conclusions he draws regarding the controversial circumstances of her death.  He offers some bizarre theories, apparently of his own supposition, based on less than concrete evidence and woven to fit unanswered questions.  You may find his theories plausible; you may find them ridiculous.  Although he does argue a somewhat convincing case, I have never seen or heard of any other documentation that would support these claims.  I believe the only real conclusion to be drawn is that we will never fully answer all the questions surrounding the mystery of her death.<br /><br />This is the story of a very special lady, a lost and deeply lonely little girl who would reach her whole life for an intangible dream of fulfillment that would slip again and again through her fingers.  This comprensive work does well in capturing the spirit of that struggle, and those who exploited it.  Judge for yourself the validity of Spoto's allegations.  Beyond that, you will find this a thorough and engrossing portrayal of our most luminous screen goddess.
B000001F2X|4.0|Normally I would not write a review after listening to an album just twice, but I want people to know that I bought this CD from Amazon recently, and the song \\"Katy Kool Lady,\\" which other reviewers have noted being removed from the disc and replaced by a different song, is now back in its rightful place.  I believe my version of the disc is an import, even though it only cost $9.98.   <br /> <br />\\"5\\" is very much in the same vein as Cale's previous four albums, which is to say, it is prime J.J. Cale.  The album just before this one, \\"Troubador,\\" is my least favorite of the early albums, as it is a little too slick for me. \\"5\\" is similar in sound, but a bit punchier, which is a move in the right direction.  There are three songs on which J.J. plays all the instruments, but there are a few others where the arrangements are more fleshed out than is usual for him.  Most notable among these is \\"Sensitive Kind,\\" which clocks in at over 5 minutes and contains vibes, congas, strings, and horns.  It's a beautiful song that lives up to its name.   <br /> <br />Another difference here is the use of female voices on many tracks, which makes the songs seem less insular and more universal.  This is where Cale began collaborating with Christine Lakeland.  In fact, \\"Katy Kool Lady\\" was cowritten with her.  It has an easy-rolling rhythm and a sing-along chorus, and is one of the album's many highlights.  On the opposite end of the spectrum--which is really not a very broad spectrum because this is a man who knows what he does best and does it--is \\"Friday,\\" which is pure rhythmic punch along the lines of \\"Anyway the Wind Blows\\" (from Okie) or \\"Mama Don't\\" (from Shades).   <br /> <br />I am quite sure already that \\"5\\" is among Cale's best.  So why do I only give it four stars?  That's because none of Cale's albums knock my socks off.  But there is something to be said for keeping one's socks on.  This is honest, unpretentious music that is easy to listen to and easy to live with--perfect for listening to after a hard day's work.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This series should still be on TV!  Lots of humourous moments.  I love the entire cast.  Nathan Fillion does a great job of being complicated - noble but not afraid of doing what he has to do if he deems it necessary.  The Serenity crew fight constantly, but they are always there for one another.    In fact, all the characters on this show have much more going on below the surface.  It's just unfortunate that the series wasn't given enough of a chance to bring out more of the nuances of each character.  I think it was a big mistake to take it off the air before the first season was completed.
B00009L1UP|5.0|Taking a break from their Mindcrime-ish sound and completely removing themselves from their past works, Empire is a very clean, highly polished rock album.

1400032717|5.0|I found this book to be absolutely enchanting. Who would think of writing a book about autism from the point of view of an autistic child? Well, ok, maybe some folks would think of it, but who could actually do it convincingly? Mark Haddon both could and did in the character of Christopher John Francis Boone, aged 15 years and 3 months and 2 days (in his words). If you want to read an entertaining story, a psychological and social study of autism and a murder mystery all rolled into one book, look no further.  <br /> <br />Just recently I discovered that The Curious Incident is considered - at least in some circles - to be a children's book! Since it is written from the point of view of an autistic 15-year it is quite easy to follow, but don't be misled -- this is a book for all ages to read and cherish. <br /> <br />I believe it will become a literary classic that will endure for a long, long time.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|\\"Oldboy\\" is an excellent film.  Its violence is startling.  Korea has two major film festivals, one is government-sponsored while the Blue Dragon festival has been controversial because it is sponsored by a conservative newspaper -- like the Fox news of Korea -- and has had scandals about vote buying.  Despite that controversy, from what I've read, it is highly influential in Korea.  This film won three major Blue Dragon creative awards.  Park Chan-Wook won as Best Director; Choi Min-Sik won as Best Actor; and Gang Hye-jeong (or Hye-jeong Kang) won as Best Actress.  The film also won the Grand Prix Award @ Cannes in 2004.<br /><br />The story grabs you from the start.  We watched the DVD in Korean with English subtitles to hear the powerful original voices of the actors.  As Oh Dae-su, Choi Min-sik does a masterful leading performance.  His character goes from obnoxious drunk to the driven haggard man who seeks revenge.  Both he and Yu Ji-tae again work with director Park Chan-Wook on \\"Lady Vengeance,\\" with a similar theme, this time with a woman falsely imprisoned.  Yu Ji-tae as Lee Woo-Jin is a smooth corporate success.  The set designer creates a cold austere penthouse where Lee Woo-Jin showers in a glass stall in his office and has waterways built into the floor.  The subplot of his illicit relationship with his sister and his murder of her is chilling.  Gang Hye-jeong as Mi-do does a good job of being the unstable caregiver that adopts Oh Dae-su upon his release and falls in love with him.  Oh Dae-su's best friend No joo-hwan is played by the paunchy Dae-han Ji and fills the role with believable friendly support.<br /><br />The images in this film are startling.  Oh Dae-su eats an Octopus.  (Apparently, Choi Min-sik is a Buddhist and had to do prayers after this scene.)  The tongue scene was gruesome & hard to watch.  The actor who plays the blond assistant to Lee Woo-Jin also did an excellent job throughout the movie.  The cinematography is top rate.  From the prison set that looks like an Asian Motel 6 to the penthouse to the outdoor images, \\"Oldboy\\" visually impresses the viewer.  While I read the usual accolades on the DVD box, I was not expecting such an excellent film.  This one is stunning.

B000HBK3MM|4.0|I first heard Corinne on Saturday Night Live and loved the sound of her voice so I decided to purchase this album.  The music is delightful.  She has a surprising range and the songs are a pleasant mix.  If you have heard her sing, the album is certainly worth the cost.  If you haven't heard her, listen to the samples, the full songs are even better.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This Oscar winning movie is every bit as good as you may have heard. There isn't single wasted frame, and just about every performance is spot-on. But the movie belongs to its two leads. Joaquin Phoenix burns darkly as the young Johnny Cash. His immersion into the role of the troubled \\"Man In Black\\" matches that of Oscar Winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman's in \\"Capote.\\" Even more fascinating is how Phoenix took the time to learn Cash's vocal mannerisms and record the songs for the movie. While Phoenix lacks Cash's low register gruffness, he still convinces as a singer. It really helps in the concert sequences, especially at the climactic legendary Folsom Prison performance.<br /><br />The same can be said for Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon, who continues to grow as an actress. As June Carter, she manages to blend warmth, spunk and humility as she lives a life that runs parallel to Cash's, even as Cash begins to fall victim to his demons. She comes to terms with Cash's ongoing advances, even as she keeps her distance from his drug addiction. And like Phoenix, she sang her parts for the soundtrack. The duet of \\"Jackson\\" will stop your clock...you'll pause to wonder if they are really singing or if they are miming to the original.<br /><br />The other singers in the cast are solid in their performances, but particular credit belongs to Waylon Malloy Payne as Jerry Lee Lewis, who plays The Killer as a mischief making imp with just a brief glimpse at his dark side. As Executive Music Producer, T-Bone Burnette does his usual remarkable job at keeping the soundtrack rootsy and authentic. There's great original songs included with Phoenix and Withersppoon's tracks, making sure that \\"Walk The Line\\" never loses that air of honesty. It cuts off when June agrees to marry Johnny in front of a live audience (essentially losing 35 years of story), but the one thing I can say to \\"Walk The Line's\\" benefit is that I didn't feel cheated. You'll come away from \\"Walk The Line\\" with a firm understanding of just why June and Johnny's marriage endured.irm understanding of just why June and Johnny's marriage endured.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This movie should definitely succeed at its goal of reviving the Bond series.  Updated for current times and starting anew from the beginning it works very well.  Although there will always be some cheesiness in a Bond movie this one keeps it to a minimum.  Bond is back to a more down to earth, gritty and even vulnerable human.<br /><br />The movie kicks off with intense action and then slows down to focus more on the plot.  The second portion is far from boring though.  The acting is very good, and the characters are believable for the most part.<br /><br />Very good movie and for once I am looking forward for the next one to come out.  Highly recommended.

080701429X|5.0|The author was sent to Auschwitz. After a while, disgust, horror and pity went numb; you could not feel them anymore. Apathy was the second stage: a &#34;protective shell&#34; to preserve one's life. Under-nourishment, absence of sexual urge came third. Thus, he began to reconstruct the manuscript he lost in the disinfection chamber. People with intellectually rich life were able to retreat &#34;within,&#34; away from their terrible surroundings. Love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Salvation of man through love and in love (p. 57) He answered YES to the question of the ultimate purpose of existence (p. 60). Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even under tremendous stress. Outside influences are not the only cause of a person's behavior. Only the men who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside, eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influence (p. 90). Any prisoner who lost faith in the future was doomed: to let go of the spiritual hold on life, caused one to die. Frankl's views truly turn Maslow's hierarchy upside down (this suggestion of mine used to send my former fiancee into fits of rage, who loved Maslow's view because it &#34;justified&#34; her lack of control in her life and her innate inability to grow spiritually and mentally).

I found myself popping this in just for this one song alone.  Watching Lukather rip it up on this track is exciting every time.   <br /> <br />It looks awesome for the majority too, especially on the close ups.  The only real problem with HD is that I it seems I'm always noticing when the camera goes out of focus.  Not a big problem, but can get annoying when you are trying to focus on how amazing the detail is on their shirts or guitar straps. <br /> <br />Overall the sound is great and the visuals just pull you in and you feel like you are actually there.  Definitley a must have for any serious Toto fan or anyone who likes good live music.

B00005JPGO|5.0|Leonardo Dicaprio and Djimon Hounsou give outstanding performances in this very emotionally charged movie.  This movie brings light to the taboo subject of modern day slavery.  And the slavery keeps happening because greedy pigs all over the world feel the need to be draped in diamonds.  Hopefully many who watch this film will learn what happens in other parts of the world and start to care more.  The movie is a real eye opener.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|As a Bond picture, this movie is nearly perfect. I was impressed right from the start. The well-done opening title sequence (interestingly, no nude women but you don't miss them) with it's somewhat retro artwork combined with the best theme song (by Chris Cornell - his voice sounding better than I've ever heard it sound - alternately warm and majestically screechy) since You Only Live Twice or Nobody Does It Better immediately hooks you.     Next, I was completely impressed with Daniel Craig. Yes, at times his face does convey a certain unBondian goofyness. But you get over that right away after the stirring opening chase scene. Craig is no soft, pretty boy Roger Moore type*. He's athletic, built like a prize fighter, and viscious. For the first half of the movie, he's like Seattle Slew as a colt - inexperienced, cocky and naive - but you know he's going to win the Derby some day. And the Derby ends by the time the last scene plays - at which time I let out an audible \\"woo!\\" and \\"yeah, baby!\\" - even though I watched the DVD alone.     This movie succeeds on so many levels. It convincingly portrays Bond before he became the icon. The action sequences and location shooting are top notch. The villian is as creepy and reptilian as any previous foe. The love story between Bond and Vesper progresses expertly and is quite moving (and unexpected). But Daniel Craig stole the show and by the time the movie ended, I was immediately thirsting for the next Craig-helmed Bond flick.     At the end of the closing credits, the producers promise that \\"JAMES BOND WILL RETURN.\\" Can't wait.       * Don't get me wrong: I loved most of the somewhat campy but fun and exciting Moore-era Bond movies. I just sort of looked the other way during Roger's \\"fight\\" scenes.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I still dont understand why people keep complaining about the acting in this film. The acting isn't bad at all. Clive Owen plays the character with restraint, giving the character the right amount of mood and energy that he requires. The plot was a piece of solid storytelling, and only a person who has a hamster on a spinning wheel in his head rather than a brain can get lost in the story. The directing was fantastic, and the cinematography was outstanding. This film is a can't miss!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I am not a devoted fan of Jane Austin, but I am certainly familiar with her work and respect it's overall merit.  I watched this movie after reading a number of reviews about it; the most critical reviews tend to focus on the way this version deviated from the written works and it's rather less glamorous visual presentation.  I cannot comment on the first criticism, because I never read this particular one of Austin's works.  As for the second, I must disagree wholeheartedly.  In fact, I think the presentation of the Bennet's home, clothing, and personal foibles was probably a lot truer to the actual history of the period that many other \\"prettier\\" historical fictions.    The relationship between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy unfolds in a refreshingly \\"real\\" way as well.  They aren't petty and catty with one another up to a moment when they experience some pivotal change of heart.  Instead, they just seem to start off unsure and distant and grow to see more in each other.  The acting required to pull this off must be subtle and genuine, and I think both actors accomplish this.  This is one of those rare love stories that attempts to capture sincerity, and it succeeds.  Mr. Darcy is not a loveable, and warm-hearted prince charming; he is \\"locked away\\" and seemingly frustrated by the society he sees around him.  He seems to genuinely seek something altogether different than he is routinely offered, and yet he doesn't fall for the crazy romantic girl (too cliche).  For Lizzie is no such girl; although not afraid to speak her mind, she is not silly and trite.  Rather, she is still a girl of the times--eager to find at least a practical husband.  Again, this is much more the way I imagine the heroines of this \\"romantic\\" period of history to be--spirited but not reckless.    I also liked the way they incorporated the music of the day not only into the film score but into the story itself.  And the characters were all well-played, if not always well-liked.  How unfortunate a mother, with her shameless gossiping, eavesdropping and meddling?  And the cinematography was beautiful, without being overpowering.  It captured the visual beauty of this more simple time--both inside and out.  It is not hard to imagine why this landscape was the source of a renaissance of romantic art.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is pure, musical entertainment fit for any audience. It is fun, wholesome entertainment not easily matched in quality and enjoyment.You can't go wrong with five adorable girls singing hauntingly beautiful songs, and that wonderful little butterfly, Mairead Nesbitt, playing the violin while skipping easily around the stage. A fulfilling experience.
1400032717|5.0|Had young Christopher from the book read the title of this review, he may have been confused. As would most people living with autism. <br /> <br />Mark Haddon did an amazing job explaining the inner workings of the autistic mind. I work with autistic children and also have a younger brother who is living with autism. This book was referred to me by a friend of mine who knew that I worked w/ kids with autism and thought it was something that I would get. She did not get it right away. In fact, she had to read the book more than once to finally grasp what the narrator was trying to express. On the other hand, I read the book once and got it right away. I saw soo many of the children I work with in the 15 year-old narrator.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about how the autistic mind works. Or you can just read it for entertainment, because the book does both with style and class.  <br /> <br />:0)
0440539811|1.0|I know that a lot of people have loved this series and have come away from this series with ideas that have become a part of them. So I really wanted to read and enjoy these books. But my brain can't follow 20 shifting characters and constant point-of-view shifts even within the same character. I'm sure that the story is brilliant. But I just couldn't manage to keep all the stories and people straight. I finally gave up altogether with the reading. These books will definitely challenge you, but they're not for everyone.
6302482585|5.0|The first time I saw Casablanca, I didn't understand why everyone loved it. I tend to look at the relationship aspect of films, and in my eyes, the romance between Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) was lacking. On the set, no one knew whether Ilsa was supposed to truly love Rick or not which caused Bergman to play the part ambiguously.<br /><br />However, I finally realized that the relationship was strong because of Rick's love for Ilsa. It didn't depend on mutual affection at all. With this revelation, I was able to see the film for what it was: a masterpiece.<br /><br />Rick own's Rick's Cafe, a seedy bar in Casablanca during WWII. Casablanca is still free from Nazi control, though Nazi leaders swarm the streets. This makes it a place filled with refugees hoping to escape to America. Of these refugees is a leader against the Nazi's, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). He brings his wife to Rick's, the beautiful Ilsa. It throws Rick into a tailspin; the two have a lot of history and he's been brooding over her since she left him. From there, he begins to act rather uncharacteristically.<br /><br />No one can deny the cleverness of the script; AFI recognized many of the lines in it's 100 Years 100 Quotes... list. Also recognized in an AFI list is the theme song \\"As Time Goes By.\\" Thanks to Casablanca, it has become a standard. This is no surprise because it is a beautiful song, and Dooley Wilson's vocals make it very charming. Max Steiner's score is wonderful as well.<br /><br />Overall, this film has a little bit of everything, but blends each seemlessly. There is history, intruige, romance, great dialogue, and excellent music. If that were not enough, on this edition of the VHS is a 20 minute documentary about the making of the film narrated by Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|I was, as indeed most people were, very sceptical when I heard, that yet another instalment of Rocky were to be made. The series withered and died with the fifth movie, that was anything but good. Or so I thought. <br /> <br />Although I was sceptical, I of course had to see the movie, and I must admit it blew me away. One of my main concerns were how they would explain Rocky going back into the ring again, seeing that he's 60 years old and all, but they made quite convincingly made it plausible. The storyline is very good if a bit simple, and the acting is solid. Stallone delivers a good performance as an aging Balboa looking for meaning and purpose with his existence. You really feel for him as he goes through all the obstacles between him and the fight. <br /> <br />Also one of the things I enjoyed very much about the movie was, that there is no animosity. The two fighters don't hate each other, there's not really any bad feelings in there, only good sportsmanship.  <br /> <br />The production values are of course top notch and more importantly the fight choreography is as good as ever. <br /> <br />This movie immediately reminds one of Rocky I with its valid story and good acting and is easily one of the best movies of the year. Highest possible recommendation.

B000089RV6|5.0|This is the quintessential rock album. A fitting tribute to Bon Scott. Brian Johnson is a legendary perfect fit for what seemed an irreplaceable front man.

There is no accounting for taste. Rock On.
B000N3STBQ|4.0|Black Celebration is one of the finest Depeche Mode albums ever to have been made (second only to Violator in my opinion). Their fifth original studio release brought the band to a whole nother level of musical genius and stature, disposing of the new romantic phase of their career and focusing on the much darker tones of the Euro gothic scene in the mid 1980s.  This comes as no surprise when one learns that Martin Gore, at the time, had recently left Basildon and purchased a flat in Berlin, where he was living in Germany, soaking up all the late night clubs and cultural decadence surrounding him.  His writing reflected this as a result.  Gone were much of the lighter sweeter aspects found on Some Great Reward, which were replaced by more raw and darkly honest subject matter (life is pain), that had only scratched the surface, previously, with songs like \\"Blasphemous Rumours.\\"        The opening title track (and subsequent name of the album) sets the tone, with a deeply seductive and foreboding message, that gives each listener their own anthem of celebrated darkness, with lead singer, Dave Gahan, at the top of his game (one of DM's finest).  The song continues, without fading out, right into the next classic piece, \\"Fly On The Windscreen,\\" another excellent song about the promise of death and living amongst all the anarchy and chaos that life has to offer.  Again, without fading out, the music continues into the second single off of the album: \\"A Question Of Lust.\\"  Sung by Martin, who delivers a well crafted and melancholily vulnerable performance, this is Mr. Gore at his absolute best, conveying the complexities and the emotional resonance of relationships on a simple yet highly effective level.  These three songs all together are reason enough to praise this album, but they're only the tip of the iceberg.  This is also the only Depeche Mode studio album where Martin Gore performs more than just one or two tracks like he does on all the rest.  Along with A Question Of Lust, we get a total of four lead vocal tracks by Gore: \\"Sometimes\\" (similar in some ways to Somebody, from Some Great Reward, but much more somber, with an echoing effect), \\"It Doesn't Matter Two\\" (an effectively dark sequel to SGR's \\"It Doesn't Matter,\\" replacing romance for melancholy) & \\"World Full Of Nothing\\" (which explores the emptiness of physical relationships that have no real emotional core...yet still mean something), show a much more multilayered side to Martin's musical and vocal talents, previously unseen.  Other classic tunes, like the mesmerizing \\"Stripped\\" (the first single off of the album),  \\"Here Is The House\\" (which was performed live only one time, during the BC tour), \\"Dressed In Black\\" (showcasing Dave Gahan at his most seductively brilliant), and the fast-paced/crowd pleasing \\"A Question Of Time\\" (the third single off the album, that'll have you toe tapping to the beat in no time) turn Black Celebration into the bonnafied classic masterpiece it rightfully deserves to be identified as.        Unfortunately, this Remastered edition suffers from not giving many of the fans from different regions (including North America) the version they grew up with and consider to be the complete album. You see, the original UK LP of Black Celebration ended with the song, \\"New Dress,\\" a very dark and bleak piece that takes stabs at societies vanities as well as the many sick and twisted shortcomings we evoke amongst ourselves (i.e., murder, famine, etc.). After listening to the entire album and having it end with this song, you can't help but fall into a state of melancholy (or \\"depressed mode\\" as it were), which is fine if that's where you want to go. But the US version offered a different solution. Unlike the UK version, the US release ended, instead, with the track, \\"But Not Tonight,\\" a song about hope and redemption. Purists will of course scoff that it was never intended to become the final number on the album, and was only recorded as the B-sideto the \\"Stripped\\" single. Many also view it as \\"too positive\\" a song, that doesn't quite fit with the rest of the album ideology (kind of like the theatrical cut of Blade Runner with the tacked on happy ending).  Since all of these Remastered editions are taken from the original UK versions, what you get here is the UK release of Black Celebration which omits \\"But Not Tonight\\" and ends the album with \\"New Dress.\\"  So if you grew up with \\"But Not Tonight\\" ending the album, the way many of us here in the states did, you probably will be very disappointed with this Remastered release, as it feels very incomplete without it.        Reprise Records and Rhino really should've Remastered the US version of Black Celebration to please everybody, instead of just giving us the same UK version that was also already released in England and Europe.  In addition to \\"But Not Tonight\\" being left off of this Remastered album, there are also some other odd and subtle differences.  A loud clicking sound can be heard at the beginning of \\"Stripped\\" (which is not heard on the original US version).  Also, the opening riff from \\"A Question Of Time\\" is played just once instead of twice, like the way it is on the original US release.  \\"But Not Tonight\\" is not completely discarded.  It can be found on the Bonus Tracks section of the DVD.  The version included is the original 7\\" single mix.  The US album version is very similar to the 7\\" single mix, but it has a cleaner, thinner sound and less reverb. These simple changes make a huge difference and the song is better for it.  It should have been included on here as well.  Such a shame it's been treated this way.        Also on the Bonus Tracks section of the DVD are some additional B-sides: \\"Breathing In Fumes\\" (a sort of extended sidebar to \\"Stripped\\"), \\"Black Day\\" (another Martin Gore lead vocal using lyrics from \\"Black Celebration\\"), and the memorable instrumental, \\"Christmas Island,\\" as well as some live tracks from the BC tour concert in Birmingham.  \\"Shake The Disease\\" (which could've easily been used for this album) and \\"It's Called A Heart\\" (originally taken from The Singles 81>85/Catching Up With Depeche Mode albums) are also present, along with their B-sides: \\"Flexible,\\" and the original version of \\"Fly On The Windscreen.\\"  As with all other Remastered DM releases, you also get the short film - Depeche Mode 1986: \\"The Songs Aren't Good Enough, There Aren't Any Singles And It'll Never Get Played On The Radio.\\"  It's another enjoyable look back at a very important era in DM's career history, with interviews by the band members and others involved in the making of the album.  The DVD also boasts impressive 5.1 Surround Sound and Hi-Res Stereo mixes that improve the sound quality, compared to the original release (though there are probably purists out there who will say it could have been done even more effectively) and the Remastered CD itself is also an audio improvement.  But, for me at least, the loss of But Not Tonight, from the end of the album, really takes its toll on the overall experience of this Remastered release, which is tarnished as a result.        While we're all entitled to our own opinions, I gotta say that there is merit in having this track included at the end. Besides many of us growing up with But Not Tonight at the end of the album, much of the importance of the song (in my opinion at least) also comes down to how you want to feel after you've listened to the entire album as a whole. For me, But Not Tonight is like a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. While life may seem hopeless and out of control at times, there is still some good in this world to look forward to. When you listen to this song after experiencing all of the darkness and pain that comes before it, you can't help but feel a sense of calming relief. A sense of hope for the future. Pessimists will dismiss all of this to be sure, but it still won't change the fact that this is a very strong and powerful songthat many still love and admire to this day, especially here in the US where it even became a single on vinyl.      Again, with this Remastered release, many fans (more so in the US) will be disappointed with the changes made to one of their all-time favorite Depeche Mode albums, which is still a Masterpiece, and a tremendous and powerful experience nonetheless.  Hopefully, someday, the US album editions will receive the same remastered treatment as their UK counterparts.  It's just a question of time.

B000N3ST8Y|4.0|After proving to themselves, the critics, and fans, that life would indeed continue without Vince Clarke, through their 1982 sophomore effort: A Broken Frame, the Mode looked and moved forward once again, and in 1983, they released their third album: Construction Time Again.  With an electronic/industrial influence (which would later be used to even greater heights on 1984s Some Great Reward), the Boys From Basildon set out to go one step further with this gripping release of metallic and organic sampling, reaching another plateau of musical awareness in the process.         The first single from the album: \\"Everything Counts,\\" is a captivatingly winning number, that holds up quite well and resonates even more today than when it was originally recorded, discussing the complexities of business ethics and the lack thereof (\\"The Grabbing Hands Grab All They Can.  All For Themselves, After All, It's A Competitive World\\").  The song is easily a fan favorite, and usually finds its way onto the live setlist for a Depeche Mode tour, with the audiences singing along in unison, back to the band.  A crowd pleasing moment to be sure.        \\"Love, In Itself\\" (the second and final single from CTA), opens the album, with a high-spirited attitude about it, that moves things along nicely.  As the song begins to finish, you start to hear what appears to be some sort of train car speeding by on tracks, as the next song, \\"More Than A Party,\\" begins to play.  A very interesting motif that's used once more, at the end of the song, and on into the opening of the third song, \\"Pipeline,\\" where it is used to it's fullest effect, as an integral part of the song.  Performed by Martin Gore (the first song he's sung on an album since \\"Any Second Now (Voices)\\" from 1981s Speak & Spell), \\"Pipeline\\" feels and sounds like one of those tunes that minors or railroad workers could be heard singing, while working at their outside jobs.  Here it is all about working on and laying the pipeline, which canbe looked upon as a metaphor for life in general.  Quite nice.  Other memorable cuts written by Gore include the fast tempo'd \\"Told You So\\" (which was released as a single in Spain) as well as \\"And Then...,\\" which, according to Alan Wilder, was at one time considered for a single release, but never quite got that far.          Alan Wilder, who'd been recruited shortly after Clarke's departure, had initially found his talents only being used for the live performances on stage and not in the recording studio.  But that all changed with Construction Time Again.  Here, Wilder's contributions can easily be identified, and a few of his own songs are used as well, including the energetically fast-paced \\"Two Minute Warning,\\" the health and nature conscious effort, \\"The Landscape Is Changing,\\" as well as the underused but memorable B-side, \\"Fools.\\" (included on the DVD as a Bonus Track).  Wilder proved, with much ease, that his talents were more than just useful.  They would become an integral part of how DM would evolve as a a band, musically.        Other Bonus Tracks on the DVD include the B-sides: \\"Work Hard,\\" and the instrumental, \\"The Great Outdoors!\\" (both written by Gore & Wilder together).  \\"Get The Balance Right,\\" a song that was previously only released as a single and also found on subsequent Singles & Best Of collections, can also be found on the DVD, along with the Remix version: \\"Get The Balance Right (Combination Mix).\\"   Also included is the short film - Depeche Mode  1983: \\"Teenagers Growing Up, Bad Government, And All That Stuff,\\" which is an interesting look back at the Construction era, with interviews by the band members and others involved in the production.         One noticeable disappointment is the fact that the additional version of \\"Everything Counts (In Larger Amounts),\\" found at the end of the original US CD release of Construction Time Again, is missing from the Remastered CD.  This is because these Remastered releases are taken from the original UK versions, which never included the \\"Everything Counts\\" bonus track.  Although it's included on the DVD in the Bonus Materials area, it's still missed on the CD.  I always thought it fit quite nicely as a full reprise of one of the most beloved songs on the album, and while the short 55 second version is still retained right after \\"And Then...,\\" it's just not the same.      Even so, this is still a wonderful installment in the DM Remaster series.  The sound quality is improved slightly on the CD, and the 5.1 Surround Sound & Hi-Res Stereo mixes are a nice upgrade (though I'm sure some of you out there will still expect better).  Throw in the entertaining and enlightening documentary, and you've got a very nice Remastered release, that belongs in every DM fan's collection.

B00005JPLU|5.0|\\"O xein, angellein Lakedaimoniois oti tede<br /> Keimetha tois keinon rimasi peithomenoi\\"<br /><br />\\"Tell the Spartans, passer-by<br />That here, obediently, we lie.\\"<br />  Simonides of Ceos (555-469 BC)<br />  For the Epitaph of the Fallen Spartans<br /><br />That epigram written by Simonides, almost 2500 years ago, made a lasting impression on me when I was studying Greek history during my highschool years, and definitely, this movie did the same. I had read Herodotus of Halicarnassus' \\"Histories\\" twice and wonder if ever this will be made into a movie, or at least some parts of it. I had seen \\"The 300 Spartans\\" but wasn't satisfied with it: the Spartan soldiers looked more like Romans than Lacedemonians (i.e. Spartans). Not until the release of the movie \\"300\\". To tell you honestly saw the movie thrice and actually enjoyed it, not for its historical accuracy, but for its brazen retelling of the battle at Thermopylae: a brave new world in film making. Awesome graphic effects, outrageous costumes, cool battle scenes choreography, etc... never, never a dull moment! But even before I watch the film for the first time I conditioned myself that this is tightly based on the \\"Graphic Novel\\" written by Frank Miller and NOT the accounts given by many ancient Greek historians, especially Herodotus, regarding the battle of Thermopylae (the Seventh Book of Herodotus called \\"Polymnia\\" detailed the accounts of the Persian campaign under Xerxes against Greece). Since I had seen it thrice, I was able to confirm and/or differentiate the existing ancient accounts against the plot and representation of the characters in the movie, hence, the graphic novel from which the film is based. Here are some high-yield, but not exhaustive, comparisons:<br /><br />1. THE LACEDEMONIANS (Spartans). They look convincing in this movie. The hairstyle of king Leonidas and facial hair remind me of those bronze statues recovered from the wreckage of ships now residing in a handful museums in Greece and Italy. The only difference is they don't wear leather \\"speedos\\", as one reviewer calls it. Of course, the producers wouldn't allow to replicate naked warriors in this movie, so as not to offend our Victorian sensibilities. Then again, should be faithful to Frank Miller.<br />2.  EPHIALTES. The Hunchback of Notre Dame Quasimodo made a retroactive appearance in this movie without Esmeralda. Don't get him wrong. He was a shepherd, as one account puts it, and nothing wrong with his external appearance.<br />3. XERXES. Part Yul Bryner, part drag queen. Substantial piercings, dog collar (where's the leash?), and wearing Victoria secret underwear. Hailed as \\"a god\\" in the movie, baritone voice-over a-la Darth Vader sans the snorkel effect.  On the walls of Persepolis in Iran he is well covered (with a robe), bearded and, ironically, looks more like Gerard Butler (like Leonidas in the movie!). Official title was Shah-han-shah \\"King of Kings\\" and not a god. Most Persians were strict Zoroastrians (hence monotheistic). It would be blasphemous if they usurp the title reserved for Ahura-Mazda, even they were members of the Achaemenid royal line.<br />4. THE EPHORS. \\"More creatures than men.\\" Wearing Benedictine habits, cloistered on top of a rocky mountain, riddled with skin disease. Leprosy, I suppose? One audience even asked \\"Where do they get their food?\\" Smart kid, but don't ask me. Want to spell their name? It's actually E-force. In contrast, the ephors were highly respected men, elected annually, five of them, in charge of civic trials, calendar, foreign policy and military training for young men. Forget the \\"drunken adolescent girl\\". The oracle was in Delphi attended by priests, not ephors!<br />5. THE IMMORTALS. Teenage mutant ninja turtles complete with samurai katanas (sword). Behind those silvered Peking-opera masks is another import. The Mummy Returns! This time, a thousand times over. If you watch the movie closely, the immortals were depicted accurately in their costumes. Unfortunately, they were thrown down into the well with the doomed African messenger. A problem of transposition. Who gives a rat's patoot about that? THIS IS SPARTA!!!!<br />6. DILIOS. Who? With one eye severed, was sent back to Sparta to rally for Leonidas' cause. Becomes Pausanias at the Battle of Plataea, gives a long speech before breaking ranks (where was the famous phalanx?) to attack the Persians. Spartans were laconic and hated long speeches. Ahem! There were two conflicting accounts regarding this person. One account said he committed suicide (by strangulation) because of ridicule and in the other account joined the other Spartans at Plataea \\"to redeem his honor\\".

B000060MWU|3.0|This movie is excellent if you are into david lynch or any other movies that make you think.  Instead of the director telling you exactly what's happening, he has you experience it from the main characters point of view. The reason i gave this movie 3 stars was only because of the quality of this dvd.  I would have given it a 1 star if it wasn't for the actual movie.  Get the 2 disc version from amazon uk.  It's a million times better.  That one gets 5 stars.
B000002J1U|5.0|This like much of early Led Zeppelin's music it has a life and sound of its own. <br />This is a rock classic for a reason, original quality rock is not common and unfortunately we often have to look to the older bands and artists to get the sounds we crave. <br />This is a very strong offering, not as bluesy as Led Zeppelin #1, but there own style and sound is more fully developed in these cuts. <br /> <br />Conclusion if you like Led Zeppelin you just need to own this! <br /> <br /> <br />
0743496728|5.0|As the mother of a four-year old son, I think this is an important book to read.  You can read all kinds of self-help, non-fictional books about appropriate and good parenting, but a good ole' fiction book can really bring in down home.  My husband is reading it now, and I think it's an excellent reminder to us as parents that our every day interactions and parenting choices have a profound effect on our children from a very early age.   <br /> <br />That soapbox message aside, it's a great book, hard to put down and very engrossing.  Jodi's novels are all fantastic and great reads, but this one probably tops the list (with The Pact and My Sister's Keepers).  What can I say, I'm partial to her novels that deal with children and parenting.
B000M3452Y|4.0|Honestly I don't generally like this genre of music unless I'm liquored up and soaked with sweat in a body car wash on a dancefloor in the early morning hours with my mind on pause and my butt in overdrive. Through my headphones or my ear pods the sound and fury generally is so minimized that I tend to get bored by the sameness and repetition of the beats and the mindlessness of the lyrics.<br /><br />Somehow with this new release LCD Soundsystem manages to sidestep most of the potholes that can cause this genre to rattle like a cheap car with worn out shock absorbers. From the rousing \\"Get Innocuous!\\" (which is anything but) to \\"Time To Get Away\\" which sounds like David Byrne and Giorgio Moroder having sex under a disco ball, \\"Watch The Tapes\\" with it's social commentary (\\"read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes,\\") the wry, anti-nostalgia of the title tune \\"Sound Of Silver\\" and the downtempo closer \\"New York I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down\\" which is a great cooldown after dancing all night, either at a club or between the sheets.<br /><br />And yet for reasons I'm not sure I can fairly express it is \\"Someone Great\\" that transcends the best of the genre into \\"Something Great.\\" Listen out loud and I think you'll understand.<br /><br />LCD Soundsystem - maybe the initials should stand for Laughing, Clappinng & Dancing. Crank it up.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|I have been hearing all of the references to Zeppelin and Sabbath and yes, you hear that influence. But make no mistake, this band has it's own new and innovative sound that blends the past with the present to form one really good band. Some of the songs have that \\"glam\\" sound of the early 1970s, yet are still fresh at the same time. I especially love the song \\"Pyramid\\" (track 9). Here is hoping that this band has numerous more recordings of this quality in them.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|What can I say about this album except that since it's release back in the 70s, it has always been one of my favorite albums.  I repurchased the album because my original copy was bad.  And I guess if you listened to a CD like this one as much as I have, your copy would be bad too.  I consider this album a classic of classics and highly recommend it to anyone.  You won't be disappointed. <br />
0156027321|3.0|Look I know this won all sorts of awards and the critics went uniformly agog over it, but frankly it just isn't interesting enough to be a novel. Some of the blurbs compare this to Hemingway's 'Old Man and the Sea.' In case you weren't aware of the history of that publication; Hemingway originally wrote that as a short story and then expanded it slightly to a 'novella' size (whatever that means) and published it in the September 1952 of 'Life' magazine. It only later was independently published as a very short novel.    Martel would have been well served to follow that example. There is no doubt his writing is brilliant at times, but it is also very self conscious and, at times, really pretentious. I know I'm not the only one who was not so impressed by this book. I don't tend to read `best sellers' like this because of this very reason. Book (or Literary, as they prefer) critics often look for books like this which are well written, but not all that interesting. They then tell us that we are not very smart if we don't fall over ourselves reading these things.     The book is well worth you time, but get it from the library or buy the mass market trade edition; this is a tad expensive for what it is.

B000AWYOGE|4.0|DARK WATER's a good horror film, if a bit overlong, and it's fueled by the passionateb performance of Jennifer Connelly as Dahlia, a woman with mother problems of her own and a history of mental instability (or merely migraines)?  Her intensity is mirrored by her little girl, Cecilia (Ariel Gade), who is like a little \\"Mini Me\\" version of Dahlia, and just as exquisite.  I remember this little girl from INVASION, and I hope the poor thing doesn't grow up with hydrophobia after her exposure to dripping ghoulish water in this film and in that ill-fated Everglades based sci fi series.<br /><br />I kept flashing back to Connelly herself as the world's most beautiful little girl actress, in Dario Argento's giallo PHENOMENA, where she had the strange power to talk to insects and make them obey her.  Just as Dahlia and Cecilia seem to be haunted by the spirit of a little girl ghost turned malevolent by the trauma of being abandoned by her mother and father (and possibly murdered by a building super?), it seemed that Connelly's American schoolgirl in Italy in PHENOMENA was also \\"acting out\\" from being abandoned by her father, an American movie star on the order of Sylvester Stallone (or Al Pacino).  Thus I think Walter Salles picked out the perfect actress to play the central part in DARK WATER, for so many of his shots recall Jennifer Connelly as a young girl, so that the performance itself is haunted by an earlier performance, and we see like X-rays the bones that made this presence work.<br /><br />I didn't understand if Dougray Scott, whom Dahlia spies talking to two evil teens who menace the building and its occupants, was in cahoots with them for real, perhaps paying them to drive his former wife crazy, or is Dahlia just paranoid?  I'd be sort of paranoid myself, especially if I sat down for a nap and didn't wake up for 24 hours.  Salles and his screenwriters lay on the agony a little thick, but how can they help themselves when they have one of the USA's most expressive actresses to bring their torments to life.  One thing I don't understand about Japanese-based horror films, don't the angry ghosts ever find a shred of happiness, or do they always just want revenge on the living?  If so, why doesn't the little Russian girl go after Pete Postlethwaite?essive actresses to bring their torments to life.

In all honesty, I can very much relate to her shopping addiction and I found my self thinking, \\"I do the same thing!\\" when she tried to rationalize making expensive and unnecessary purchases. This is a smart and funny book that will make you want to pull an all-nighter to finish.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|Every critics said this is the best bond ever, but they never said why. Every body said, Craig is the new Bond, because he is the closest Bond as Ian Fleming books said, but I just wondering how many of you ever read the book. Why suddenly every body care what Ian Fleming wrote, are the previous Bonds did not based on the character. Worrying their new Bond not convincing enough, they even shot a screen in the train where Bond first met Vesper, trying to tell the audience, What Bond should be, it's just pathetic. I do not know the Bond Fleming wrote, but I saw every Bond movies, and I am sure this new Bond is not James. <br />Casino Royale plot is simple, out to date (written 1953) and confusing for everyone who do not know what Poker game is. Just like M said in the movie, how she missed the cold war, this Bond movie should have much larger scale than a terrorist that love gambling. <br />Two stars, Just because they said this is a Bond movie.
B000067DNC|5.0|Love this series. I have all the seasons. Great to view over and over from the beginning any time I want.
B000000WA4|5.0|This is such an amazing album! WHY? Because with most bands and most double albums..there is not much variety. The songs pretty much sound the same and there isn't much to explore with the band.<br />This isn't the case with \\"Mellon Collie\\".<br />I hate that I didnt discover this album sooner than I did because this is a masterpiece! I usually dont call albums that but this is a masterpice!<br />I can only describe the album as \\"genre hopping\\"..in a good way.<br />They explore so many different sounds and emotions through the record that one never gets tired of listening to the album.<br />There are 28 songs and a song for everything, ranging from EPIC (Tonight, Tonight), Angry (Zero, Bodies, Tales of a Scorched Earth, etc), Quiet (Take Me Down, Farewell and Goodnight, To Forgive, Thirty-Three), Electronic (1979, We only Come out at night), To the love songs (Beautiful, Lily) to The hard out rockers (Bullet with Butterfly Wings, Muzzle)<br />This album proves why those other bands (whom I like as well) like Pearl Jam and Nirvana could have never pulled off a double album. This is a grand, epic, sprawling set that no band would dare to rip off in the subsequent years.<br />Just so much selection and different arrays of sounds.<br />This album turned me into a fan and I consider this their magnum opus (Pinnacle work)<br />Please do listen to this and discover the amazing sound of The Smashing Pumpkins at their prime. I have never looked back!

B000FQ4M58|5.0|The big problem with this record is that we, the hardcore fans of the team that brought us the previous Bat records, love these records so much. And, unfortunately for us, the team that brought us those great records were fighting when this one was made. <br /> <br />This Bat is a part of the other two, and we love them, but this Bat is missing the magic formula, which is the singer and the songwriter, working together. Still, we have Jim Steinman's songs available, albeit in a patchwork from other projects, which makes this project a patchwork, which is a real shame. A Bat record is like Thanksgiving dinner, and you shouldn't mess it up. <br /> <br />I found my love for the other Bats and my disappointment with this patchwork getting in the way, and I'm still angry with it, but many of the songs have all slowly grown on me. <br /> <br />The lyrics are still good Meat Loaf fun, when they do work, but overall, I was, again, disappointed with the sad theme of things throughout most of it. The Bat material, and Meat Loaf, have become our friends, in a way. How could they do this to us, the fans?  <br /> <br />My advice is this: Take from this record what you want, and leave the rest. It is a patchwork, so treat it as such. <br /> <br />What you'll be left with are some great Steinman songs, and more than that, and what saves it-Meat Loaf himself. <br /> <br />He really gives you the oft-quoted 110%. The man really sings his f'n guts out, with all the depth of his experience, with all the natural gift he still has. <br /> <br />I'm angry, I'm disappointed, and part of me wants to smash this thing to bits and mail it back to both Mr. Loaf and Steinman, but man...when it works, it really works. <br /> <br />This thing is like a big LEGO set with many of the pieces missing. Incomplete, yet you can still make something with it.  <br /> <br />There is still some magic here in this flawed Bat record, and that makes it a success. <br /> <br />

B0001HAHXW|5.0|Eric Clapton lit a huge fire when he recorded Crossroads live at Royal Albert Hall, London, UK with Cream in the late 60's. That recording kicked ECs career into overdrive as every guitar player since has heard it if not copied licks from that stellar performance. Through-out his career Clapton has shown to be significantly influenced by Robert Johnson's music. He has gone as far as to pay royalties to Johnson's decendents for the use of his music. This new CD was recorded in the very same room of the now abandon Houston Tx, building where Robert Johnson himself recorded this music in (2 sessions)1936-37. Johnson's guitar technique was such that Clapton himself admitted to not be able to do it justice (all while singing and playing in one take) and therefore employed Doyle Bramhall to cover some of the guitar work. This effort is the sincerest form of tribute I can imagine. This is not music that Clapton recorded because of it's comercial value. This is a true labor of love. This is intrinsicly blues therefore blues fans and musicologists alike will dig it.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I highly recommend The World at War documentary series. It not only provides a non-biased and in-depth coverage of the multi-faceted events of the War that tainted lives of hundreds of millions of people all over the world, but also represents a masterpiece in the realm of historical films. Exciting, breathtaking, astounding - all these and more epithets can be used to describe the series. I found the quality and depth of the documentary material overwhelming, and the flow of historical facts fascinating. The series provides the Big Picture of the War, investigates the roots of the conflict, unveils the numerous linkages and relationships between nations and individuals that contributed to the origins, development and culmination of the greatest tragedy in our Planets' history - World War II. It's a must to see. <br />

6304711921|2.0|This movie.  My responce; huh?  This may be the most creepy thing ever.  I watched it, and I didn't really feel like I had just watched a movie.  It felt like I had just been stupified in front of a whole lot of people.  Was I supposed to get that?  I was thinking about watching it with my daughter, but I'm glad I decided not to.  She is still a young girl of and ACADEMIC (hint, hint) mind set.  I will always be happy to watch a movie with her, but not one that is this stupid.
006072448X|4.0|I was fascinated and impressed by this story of a school shooting and the killer's mother's attempts to make sense of her son and their relationship as a piece of writing, but I had significant problems with the characterizations.  Kevin, for example, is so appalling a literary creation that he's not credible as a human being.  This means that his father's myopia also lacks plausibility. No parent could remain so stubbornly naive and oblivious to the problems of a child like Kevin, who is not a morass of well-suppressed hostilities waiting to blow in adolescence but rather a patently-obvious disaster area virtually from the moment of his birth. <br /> <br />Eva's worries about whether her conflicted attitude towards motherhood could have produced this little sociopath are therefore also implausible.  A child this severely disturbed doesn't result from Mommy's ambivalence about whether she wants to be a mommy, and Eva is otherwise more than intelligent enough to know it.  There is one instance of maternal abuse in the story, but it results FROM Kevin's already impossible behavior, it is not the catalyst for it.  For that reason, and even while making allowances for the shock and guilt any parent in her situation would feel, I found much of Eva's soul-searching about whether she is at fault for Kevin's murderous criminality to be tedious and misplaced.   <br /> <br />Still, the prose is excellent, the story does move, and the fact that Shriver creatively avoids meditations on American gun culture and related issues in favor of exploring the psychology of parenthood and contemporary parent-child relationships (albeit via an extreme case of dysfunction) raises this novel well above the level of the straightforward thriller it might have been.  Strongly recommended.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Not that there isn't plot or eye candy or things that go crack and boom...but the characters and their interactions drive the real power of Serenity and make it a joy to watch.

B000002KXV|5.0|The Nightfly marked Donald Fagen's return to the recording studio following the post-Gaucho Steely Dan breakup.  The overall sound is very keyboard-heavy in typical Fagen fashion, and his lyrics are primarily set during the prosperous Eisenhower-era 1950's.  Some of the residual Gaucho sound is still present on \\"Greenflower Street\\" and the album's title track.  However, most of the album sways back and forth between a more contemporary sound (\\"New Frontier\\" and \\"I.G.Y.\\") and a sound that harkens back to days gone by (\\"Maxine\\" and \\"Walk Between The Raindrops\\").  Fagen even takes on calypso in the light-hearted \\"The Goodbye Look\\".  Overall, fans of early Steely Dan will likely be disappointed, but those who enjoyed the Katy Lied/Royal Scam/Gaucho years should feel right at home.
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby writes this book with a wonderful sense of humor and he makes the photography concepts he is explaining very easy to understand. Instead of just writing out a lecture on photography concepts, he tells the reader what exactly they need to do in order to take certain kinds of pictures. He covers many kinds of photography, such as nature, travel/urban, sports, weddings, and portraits. He provides some great tips on how best to compose your shots so that they turn out really well. I have taken his book out shooting with me and have used it as a reference guide for when I know I want to take a certain type of shot. It works out great! This is definitely the perfect book for anyone who is interested in photography and wants an easy way to get better and taking pictures.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|With the success of the movie `Apollo 13' Tom Hanks hooked up with HBO to do a historical docudrama with the same values that the BBC would put into a historical drama about the fall of Rome, such as `I, Claudius'. The appeal of doing something of this value on a 20th century topic such as the entire space race was just too good to refuse. In fact it was so good that HBO later hooked up with the BBC to produce the epic series `Rome'.<br /><br />HBO defined the meaning of the `early 21st century television series are better than movies' phase, back in 1998 with `From Earth to the Moon'. It is amazing that they packed so much into just 12 x 1 hour episodes. It is also fitting that the title, From the Earth to the Moon, is also the title of a science fiction story by Jules Verne. The quality of the special effects is top notch stuff, just like the film. The range of actors is amazing and all of the stories reveal some interesting facts that you just took for granted or thought otherwise about. This is the kind of thing that makes you want to go out and actually read a science book afterwards.<br /><br />All the episodes have an introduction by Tom Hanks.<br /><br />#1 Can We Do This? -- The space race begins after America is caught napping and the Soviets send a man into space. Kennedy announces his attentions to send a man to the moon. Shepard makes the first American space flight.  Mercury and Gemini projects are born along with attempts at spacewalk, something the Soviets also did first.<br /><br />#2 Apollo One -- Apollo 1 catches fire in a NASA training room and the crew are killed while under scientific observation. This congressional hearing faced some tough decisions.<br /><br />#3 We Have Cleared the Tower -- Apollo 7 mission is covered from the perspective of a documentary film making crew.<br /><br />#4 1968 -- Apollo 8 makes the first lunar flight.<br /><br />#5 Spider -- The engineering of the Lunar Module for both Apollo 9 and Apollo 10.<br /><br />#6 Mare Tranquilitatis -- Apollo 11 moon landing. America gets their first this time. The title of this episode is the landing site on the moon.<br /><br />#7 That's All There Is --Apollo 12 has fun on the moon.<br /><br />#8 We Interrupt This Program -- This is the Apollo 13 story (the film version is the one which Tom Hanks stared in). Since there is no reason to redo another Apollo 13, HBO tell it from the story of a TV anchorman who is facing a new form of tabloid reporting interfering with his scientific approach. Postmodernism after the moon landing has changed his life forever.<br /><br />#9 For Miles and Miles --Shepard goes back into space for the second time to land on the moon and plays golf.<br /><br />#10 Galileo Was Right --Apollo 15 astronauts turn scientific geologists and expert reporters. Galileo's law of falling bodies is proved again, this time on the moon's surface.<br /><br />#11 The Original Wives Club -- This tells the story of the heartache and troubles that the wives of these men had to deal with. The episode is more interesting than what it sounds at first. The statistics on astronaut divorce rates are a whopper.<br /><br />#12 Le Voyage dans la Lune -- The last Apollo 17 mission to the moon and revision of previous moon landings.<br /><br />Overall this is a real brain stimulator that could be summed up by saying that people like Shepard and Gagarin were absolutely crazy to have done what they did.

B00004TX5F|4.0|Thank goodness this prize-winning, one-of-a-kind film \\"Farinelli\\" was made, even though there are many disappointments about it.  It makes a good story about the greatest singer ever; however, the plot has little to do about the real Carlo Broschi.  Some scenes and ideas about him actually are the antithesis of the real man.  I would guess that this story is about 10% Carlo, 10% about other known castrati, 10% about castrati in general, 20% about Baroque opera and that era, and 50% just plain fiction.  As astonishing as Farinelli's voice and career were, he did not have the conflicts and drama film makers believed necessary to make a successful movie; therefore, they made it up.<br /><br />My being a true music lover and also knowledgable about Baroque belle canto, I'm most disappointed in the voices used.  The Sony techs knew how to electronically meld the voices of a countertenor and a female soprano, but obviously they knew little about the belle canto sound, regardless of the fact that there were clues in their own script(!), let along first-hand accounts written by knowledgable people of that time.  Admittedly in 1994, better trained countertenors were only beginning to appear, so the established, average-voice one chosen may have seemed reasonable to the film makers.  In addition, the breathy, warbly, imprecise approach among most female sopranos (along with their distinctly female timbre) had become engrained and accepted by most listeners since the 19th century, so the makers did not sense that this soprano's voice was inappropriate in their attempt to approximate the castrato voice.  If they had been more careful in choosing, they should have insisted that supreme soprano Gundula Janowitz participate in the production.  And for the countertenor, they should have chosen Andreas Scholl.  Regardless of the fact that he was early in his countertenor carreer, he was known for that as well as his earlier experience as a boy soprano.<br /><br />The other musical disappointment is, to keep the movie length shorter, the arias were truncated to 2/5 their original length or less.  This is understandable from a film-maker's view; however, the viewer misses the intent to the Da Capo aria form where the repeated musical theme provides the singer (who in a sense was a \\"co-composer\\") with the opportunity to \\"show his stuff,\\" i.e., his acrobatic vocal skills, high notes, and his musical understanding.  The CD soundtrack does have the complete arias and, therefore, is more informative and satisfying.<br /><br />Since this 1994 film was made, interest among music lovers in Baroque vocal works has expanded greatly with many new productions of operas, oratorios, etc., from Handel, Hasse, Bononcini, Mozart, etc.  The Center for the Study of Farinelli has been established in Bologna.  Farinelli's remains were discovered in 2006 and are being studied.  A new production approached carefully and seriously, well researched, financed, cast, and directed, would be very welcome.ical disappointment is, to keep the movie length shorter, the arias were truncated to 2/5 their original length or less.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|The fantastic film marks the start of a new era for Bond, in a stunning return to form, casting off all the silly gadgets and dodgy CGI effects that held back the recent Brosnan films.  This is the film that should have been made before any of the others, but due to well documented legal problems the producers had to start with Dr No. <br /> <br />For the first time in many years, the plot is based on an Ian Fleming Bond novel, his very first, and thankfully, the screenplay follows the novel pretty closely, bar the changes needed to bring it into present day.  Bond is at the beginning of his 00 career, he has not been on any other previous missions as 007, so for those people looking for continuity between this and the previous Bond films, don't - there simply isn't any.  As far as the classic Bond gunbarrel sequence goes, I feel it would have been wrong for the producers to use it in this film, as it would created the impression that this film follows on from the previous films.  The title song is nothing special, unfortunately, but is miles better than Madonna's effort.  The great ending to this film - \\"My name's Bond, James Bond\\", which feeds into the famous James Bond theme, creates the impression that the next film will feature the standard gunbarrel sequence that has been the Bond trademark for 40 or so years.  <br /> <br />It seems like the producers have drawn a line underneath Die Another Day and the other 19 Bond films and said \\"that's it, we're starting again\\".  I for one, am glad they have - this is just the new start the franchise needed. <br /> <br />
B000055Y0X|5.0|This film was a must-see for those of us who were part of the Strategic Air Command in the early 70's. We understood that our mission was one of deterrence and Dr. Strangelove was exactly the image that we needed to project to make the most of it. If it had not been so brilliantly written and directed, one might have suspected that it had been funded by the Pentagon. Hilariously entertaining and recommended for people of all political persuasions. <br />
B00008IHN1|5.0|This was a movie that all teens or anyone with self-doubt should see.  It shows how determination and proper help can help one be a success in life. I would recommend it to all over the age of about 12. The music itself is well worth the money spent.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I was looking for Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind for a while and when I finally saw it I wasn't disappointed. For being one of studio Gibli's first works its animation quality was better than I expected and its story had substance. I'm happy I bought it.

B000063UR2|5.0|This movie arrived in excellent, like-new shape.  It is definitely worth purchasing.  The case is beautiful and unique, and adds much more to the original movie.  The extras are great in the director edition.  Anyone who loves a good fairy-tale will fall in love with this flick.  Great purchase!
1416914285|1.0|A new entry to the young adult urban fantasy genre, but not really one that adds anything new to it.    Overall, I wouldn't say this was a great book, nor would I recommend it for younger teen readers - it's plodding and slow-going, and people will tear their hair out waiting for the pace to pick up. I think this book probably suits adults more in that respect (in a way - I wouldn't say the subjects were interesting to adults in general, just those with an interest in young adult fiction) - it's like the very long introduction of the first half of a longer story.    It was surprisingly uncool (setting/character descriptions, dialogue etc) as far as books with vampires/demon hunters in it go (sorry - I'm from the Buffy generation and that's just how I saw it), and I thought, given the supernatural element of the book, there were many missed opportunities to present new ideas on how a demon hunting otherworld might exist. Instead, old, pre-existing ideas were rehashed, and not in a way that would make them more compelling than before.    Given that the book is part of a trilogy, I expected there to be a lot of boring set-up pieces for the benefit of the next two volumes, but that's no excuse for this novel to be dull. There was potential for more here, and even though the book is quite long (because of the laboured, awkward way a lot of it is written), by the end it still felt like there was a rush to fit in important plot elements (the location of the most important relic of the book was really boring; it should have been one of the most - if not *the* most - exciting things that happened). I felt a bit ripped off that some of the more interesting things in the book were not given enough attention, and things like the colour of people's hair in certain shades of light was (I like that sort of detail, as well, but not all of the time. That the physical appearance of certain characters was constantly made light of was distracting. It even made them seem less attractivethan they were portrayed as being).    There was one big emotional pay-off at the end from otherwise unrealised lead characters. Unfortunately, despite that one pay-off, it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of it.
0374105235|5.0|This is a down to earth, heart-wrenching true story of how a boy manages to find himself pulled into a very ugly civil war. Ishmael tells a very poignant story of how his life was before the war and how he trys to stay one step ahead of the rebels. At the very beginning, he is separated from his family. He eventually is caught by the soilders and brainwashed into fighting as boy soilders against the rebels. This goes on for several years until foreign peacekeepers intervene and take Ishmael and a few others to camps to try and dissemilate them back into society. You will not want to put the book down until you are finished.
B00007LTIL|4.0|There is no doubt that these songs are among the best in American musical history. If you have never heard the Dead before or want to try to get into them, this might be a good place to start.<br /><br />But you can't review Dead albums the way you review other bands. 4 stars, because these are good but not the best performances of these songs.<br /><br />Other bands release their \\"material\\" in \\"albums\\". Other bands have their songs all written out. The Dead do not just have \\"songs\\". They have versions upon versions and arrangments upon arrangements of all their songs...so that their individual songs are more like a framework for the band to build up into a unique artwork at every concert.<br /><br />If you like the tunes on this CD, I recommend you next get the live album \\"Reckoning\\". [...]. There is a whole universe of excellent music out there, once you get into the Grateful Dead.
6304779356|5.0|When I first started teaching horror film four years ago, I quickly learned one lesson: my students born after 1986 hate this film. And I simply could not understand why ... it does not contain the deep homoerotic sensuality of Jordan's (Rice's) \\"Interview with the Vampire,\\" it does not have the uber-stylized cinematography of Scott's (Strieber's) \\"The Hunger,\\" and it does not have the frequently misunderstood black-humor of Bierman's \\"Vampire's Kiss.\\" So why such resistance? I'll tell you why . . . that super-shiny, muscle-bound, shirtless guy playing the sax off the boardwalk (during the musical sequence when Star and Michael lock eyes). No joke. And, now, I can almost see why everything after that very moment is destroyed for them ... Luckily, I was born before 1986: and I love this film! <br /> <br />Opening with Echo and the Bunnymen's cover of \\"People are Strange,\\" the films sets an immediate tone: Santa Carla is an odd little city;) But how \\"odd\\" is yet to be discovered ...  <br /> <br />The antics of Frog Brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander) easily translate as hysterical even today (twenty years later!!) I mean, to challenge the forces of the supernatural with logic gleaned from comic-books? Very funny! And to be surprised when it doesn't work? Even funnier!! <br /> <br />The soundtrack (to me) is as appealing as ever. The casting is fantastic!! Let me just be honest, this is how I know Kiefer Sutherland ... not as Jack Bauer but as David the Vampire (and, seriously, I'm just waiting for the day that Jack is revealed to be David .. keep your fingers crossed!!)  <br /> <br />I'm not a fan of \\"slayer\\" films per say ... I like my vampires alive (well undead) and biting. But, even I must admit, this film has it all: eroticism, blood & gore, comedy, a devil-dog (not the yummy kind, unless you are into that) and a really shiny guy playing a sax! <br /> <br />Just buy it already!! <br /> <br />Suggested reading: Latham, Rob. \\"Consuming Youth: The Lost Boys Cruise Mallworld.\\" Blood Read: The Vampire as Metaphor in Contemporary Culture.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|I bought the DVD today and have already gone through the extra features in addition to watching the movie again.  The DVD is well worth the money.  For those like me that can't get enough of the Rocky movies, the DVD has deleted scenes and an alternate ending that adds some things to think about as the Rocky series rides off into the sunset.  The Stallone commentary is great.  There is also a segment on the filming of the boxing scenes and I was blown away with the reality.  I'll forever be a Rocky fan.
1582701709|1.0|Opps, I feel for it again!! Another Oprah recommendation. This book reads like it was written by an eight year old, a slow eight year old. It just says the same thing over and over and then finds twenty experts to say the same thing over and over. Ill save you some money and tell you the secret, your about to lose 15 bucks.

0312954468|5.0|I have read this novel 3 times now- it is so wonderful!  There are only two books that make me so sad to reach the ending, \\"River God\\" and \\"Lonesome Dove\\".  Two very different books set in two very different times, but the characters become your friends, and you become so involved in their stories. <br /> <br />You must read this book... atleast once!
B0009VRHLK|2.0|Notice the edit when the camera moves down to his nether regions. Such chutzpah: Using an amply endowed body double to stand him for him.  I'll bet his conquests are disappointed.  <br /> <br />Otherwise, pretty amatuerish, low-budget affair, e.g., a long single take of him driving with the camera mount crooked and his face forced out of frame. Good 10-minute shot of the back of his head and the backseat, though. Maybe an amateur can be a director, but not a DP. <br /> <br />Still, VG's bizarre personality offers some dark ironical humor (I think it's ironical).  Anyway, better than Ron Howard or Spielberg.
B000MGUZMU|2.0|Neon Bible is an OK album, not nearly as good as Funeral and the band drifts into poppy Springsteen esque musings that lack the depth and intensity on Funeral. Neon Bible is OK, I would have given it three stars but this \\"special edition\\" is a complete rip off. I expected some sort of real nuance into explaining the band more. Instead you get two mini-flip books that are composed of photos the band orchestrated in order to make some lame animated still-photo junket. Very, VERY self indulgent and offers nothing special or really extra to fans. A lame hook to get people to buy this thing. I am an impulse buyer, no one but myself to blame utlimately for falling for this con job in packaging. But the band should be ashamed of tricking fans into buying this. Music is OK if you're into Arcade Fire, but this special edition is inexcusable, no extra songs, nothing really extra at all or special, unless you're into stop-action photographic animation and in the day of the internet and hi-def TV, this is laughable. Buy the regular edition, not being ripped off will allow you to enjoy this album more.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I didn't expect to enjoy the movie all that much but, it is very good.  I recommend it highly to anyone, it presents very real universal human experiences.

If you want a review from some one who has been listening to the blues since the late 1950s, read on. \\"The Hook\\" is his magical self as always. He goes from \\"havin Delta mud squeezin between his toes\\" to full out \\"boogie chillun.\\" What more can you ask. \\"The Heat\\" is a great white boy blues band and for this compilation added a touch of harmonica. My idea of the ideal blues band song would have everything that is in this compilation but maybe a touch more of piano or harmonica....This sucker is soulful and it cooks. I love the spoken line \\"let's boogie.\\" The best covering of black blues music by a white band I have ever heard. Add John Lee and you have got a winner. Buy it, play it, enjoy it and you will never regret the purchase.
B000NHPCS0|4.0|There was only one problem I had with this movie.  I understand the ending and why it had to end the way it did but what was in the envelope.  I'm the kind of movie watcher that likes to get the whole story and this movie left just a little too much up to the imagination.  It seemed like they were going on telling the story and there were points where you would think, \\"ok I'm gonna find out what that was about later,\\" and BAM, the movie's over.  Maybe it would have been more complete if it was 5 hours long........but maybe not.

1563890119|4.0|That doesn't mean that this is a bad book. It's good, but compared to the stories that Gaiman and company would come up with later on down the road, well, let's just say that it might suffer by comparison. I didn't start off the series with this. If you do, you might quit (but then again, you might not). I started off with the story collections first (Dream Country, Fables and Reflections and World's End), then I proceeded onto the longer storylines. If you are strictly into reading it in chronological fashion, that's your choice. The beauty of the entire series is that you don't HAVE to read them in order (excepting volumes 9 and 10, you have to finish the series with those). Beyond that, think of it as a giant playground for the reader to wander and enjoy.  <br /> <br />Lastly, the final story, the stand alone, \\"The Sound of Her Wings,\\" introduces us to Dream's unforgettable sister, Death. It's the story Gaiman himself said where he \\"found\\" his voice for the series and reading it, it's hard to disagree. It's the best story of this volume and fully worth the price of the book alone.  <br /> <br />Still, not the ideal intro, but eventually it becomes essential part of the Sandman story arc.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|Don't Bother TO READ THIS IF YOU ARE A FAN of MS. JONES!<br />I picked up this cd on Amazon, after finally giving in to the hype (and the cover photo too) I thought the title :Its'Not Too Late\\" may convey some meaning in my life through her music about my own regrets in life. Music often helps us find a way to feel better. BUT THIS is what I would call RETRO early 1990's \\"EMO\\" and it is awful. Musically it is not something that connected with me. I could not hear her words past the \\"EMO\\" musical style of sad compositions. I was afraid to read the lyrics, because they might actually be WHAT I was looking for, But they are not! they are the things people now call \\"EMO\\": AND it is at its worst.<br />THIS music style may be for some people and those of you know do enjoy or Understand this artist; Great. But I found it depressing and the very antithesis of what the album of the 1995 \\"JAGGED LITTLE PILL\\" was!!<br />I am past wallowing in this kind of self pity. BUY The \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" instead. Your life will be better for it. Skip this album!
1401207138|5.0|I took the enormous risk of purchasing the Absolute Edition of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' epic Watchmen without having read it previously. If I hated it, I'd be out the money I paid for it, if I loved it, well, it would be money well spent. I'm therefore pleased to report that the cash was well spent.<br /><br />DC's Absolute Editions are the comic equivalent of say, the 2 disc Collector's Editions of movies with all the extras for the truly dedicated. It isn't exactly necessary. The core story isn't changed (though due to age and technology not available, it may be remastered and recolored, and that ain't a bad thing) and all kinds of neat bonus things are included. For the Watchmen fanatic, this edition will meet their very high expectations (a difficult thing to do). Copies of Moore's original scripts and Gibbons preliminary artwork are included. The entire novel has been recolored (and approved by Gibbons, Moore has little to no contact with DC) and the results which the Absolute Editions make clear, are spectacular.<br /><br />If you just want the story, then you probably should either buy the paperback (or check it out from your local library system). But if you are a devotee of this epic story, then you owe it to yourself to pick this edition up. You won't be sorry. It will be time and money well spent and endless hours of pleasureable reading and rereading will await you.
1401307787|5.0|I had been going through tremendous stress and anxiety related to a variety of issues.  I started this book and it has helped me \\"rethink\\" the way things are and should be.  It has helped me put so many things in perspective.  I now read a small portion each morning as sort of a daily affirmation before heading off to work.  It's one of the best books I've bought in quite some time related to the subject of mindfulness.
1400082773|4.0|Well written... unique <br />All in all, I found this book to be an extremely well crafted story of Senator Obama's pre-senatorial years. Those looking for political porn (a la Coulter, Limbaugh, Franken, etc.) will no doubt be disappointed; Overt politics are not at all a part of this work (though it may help to explain/clarify the roots of Sen Obama's positions on [esp.] social issues).  <br /> <br />It is not any kind of \\"call to action\\" or manifesto either, which really makes it unique (for a politician)... It seems that it is more of a work of self-exploration of both ethnicity (both his own, his community, and their respective relationship), family, and how he fits into the puzzle. What struck me most is the honest way he explored his relationship with his ever-present yet non-existent father. This seems to be (as the title infers) the main theme of the book. As the chapters go by, the reader gets to see more and more the character of Barack Sr., both good qualities and bad, through memories, his brief encounters with his many African siblings, and how all of these things helped shape the overall outlook of the author and his relationship to and with both sides of his family (though this book deals mostly with the Kenyan side).  <br /> <br />Of all the books I've read by many politicians, this one is refreshingly candid. He didn't seem to be afraid to divulge his insecurities, anger, drug/alcohol use, etc, and to strip away the veneer of infallibility that we see so often with celebrities (be it Hollywood or political). In other words, this book feels like it was written by a human. <br /> <br />(p.s. I give very few things 5 stars) <br /> <br />
0743455967|2.0|Love most of Stephen King's books (his endings are frequently crappy, though; I mean a SPIDER at the end of 'It' when, for some hundreds of pages, we've been spooked by a clown, come on!) but his books are entertaining. I was surprised by On Writing, however. Basically, the 'writing advice' can be bottled down to 1: Start with a situation, not a plot. 2: avoid adverbs and adjectives. 3: Write at least 1,000 words per session (I know people who can't write 50 words in 3 hours, so where does this leave them?) 4: Do a whole first draft before commencing a second. 5: Read a lot and write a lot. And that's it! Er, hello? Is it just me, or does this 'advice' appear to be a tad thin on the ground? The 'advice' King dishes out in On Writing is BASIC, NO-BRAINER stuff. The first section of the book, 'CV' is uproarously funny, honest, and illuminating. But he screwed up on the 'Writing Advice' (or maybe he told us just what he wanted to tell). Shame. I really enjoy King's forewords to his books and I always thought him intelligently wacky and a class storyteller. So when this book came out I whipped it off the shelf and ran home to read it.I was looking forward to some nuggets of advice; instead I got cow dung-balls.
B000EULJLU|5.0|more and more, TOOL's music requires a great deal of focus and mental acuity to appreciate the way it should be.  Each song on this album can be interpreted in a variety of ways, filled with layer upon layer of meaning.   <br /> <br />If I could give this album 10 stars I would.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I have always thought that this was one of his strongest albums. The songwriting is thoughtful, interesting, and clever. The music is equally solid. Even his take on familiar genres--blues, ballads--are fresh and strong. His singing is as good as it ever gets, which may be an acquired taste for some, but he is at his peak here. Along with \\"After the Gold Rush\\", \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\\", and \\"Harvest\\", I think this work completes the Holy Quadrangle of early Neil Young.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is the imaginative story of a young girl in the midst of major change in her life. Her resistance to this change is transformed into character by a job at a bathhouse for the spirits. The movie is beautifully done, a class above most others. Spirited Away is full of fun and excitement, examples of challenge and growth, unique fantasy and humor. My young daughter loves it and watches it regularly. I highly recommend Spirited Away to everyone.
B000C13Y2S|4.0|Works as advertised, but pretty big for a key chain in my mind.  Uses LED's.  It is handy if you need a small light source pointed in one spot but nobody to hold it.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|This is the definitive version of the Peter Pan Story, I will assume that most reading this review have seen this or other versions.      I am glad to say that the movie on the DVD is as I have seen it in the movie theaters.  Some things that I was worried would be completely or partially edited out include the Indians, and the Pixie dust.  Although some could say that the song the Indians sing is less then politically correct and the pixie dust could be a substitute for drug abuse.  However, everything is there, Disney seems to be learning that we want them as they first appeared in the theater.  But, if you take those things out you do not have Peter Pan.  One thing that was removed after the first release, by Walt Disney himself (reportedly), is the story of how Peter assists Tinker Bell after she injured from Bomb which Captain Hook intended for Peter.  Just watch the film, one moment her light is dimming (similarly to what happens in the stage play) and in the next edit Tink is just fine.  I was hopping that they would have put this on the DVD, but, I have not found it.  The stage play uses poison instead of a bomb, so it is understandable that they did not put that in the Disney film, too similar to drug use.  From what I have read, Peter sings a song and that brings Tink back to full health.    Any how, the extra features on the DVD are great, other than the missing song mention earlier.   There are some extra features that seem strange, like the virtual fight over London, it is limited (to put it nicely).  Could have been better, if you could choose which direction to go or fly up and down, otherwise any low budget video game is much better.  Overall, I am happy with this DVD edition and will wait for a Legacy edition (a DVD with the original and all the sequels) before I by another version, even HD, of Peter Pan.  Hopefully, Disney will put all the missing senses in newer versions.
1573229725|5.0|This book totally transported me to 19th century England.  It was well written and quite engrossing.  The plot kept me reading, and I finished this book in an uncharacteristically short time (I usually take weeks to finish a book - this one took me under a week).  It shows the dark & unusual sides of that time period.<br /><br />If you are into \\"period\\" literature but hate the boring ho-hum stuff and instead want to explore thieves' dens, dark mansions, hints of deviant sexuality, etc., then this book is for you!  I can't wait to read it again.
B000H0MKGK|1.0|Can someone please explain what the record company was smoking when they collectively said \\"Yes, let's record and produce this.\\"  I've heard more pleasant sounds coming from malfunctioning power tools and flatulent livestock.

I would rather have a root canal or pass a kidney stone than to sit through a John Mayer CD.

Clean out your ears or close your eyes because yes...The Killers are the best thing I've heard in ages. I only recently got my hands on both Hot Fuss and Sam's Town and it was amazing to (finally!) find two albums I could actually listen to from start to finish.

B000007VCO|5.0|I had come across this album on lp in the Bargin Bin back around 1981 and, taking a chance,  found it to be a pleasant surprise.  I had not known of its release a few years earlier and found the music to be a bit different from earlier Santana releases.  But it was a music which would grow upon a listener with each spin on the turn table.  Although credited to Devaip Carlos Santana, it features many of his regular band musicians at the time.  The cuts don't seem to have as much percussion as earlier Santana albums, but Carlos Santana's guitar, Tom Coster's keyboards and Greg Walker's vocals provide audio verification that it is a Santana endeavor.  As mentioned by other reviewers, it is an excursion into jazz, but it is pure Santana nonetheless and it doesn't disappoint.  Even Sri Chinmoy's short spoken poems are a good fit into the overall experience and appear to aid in the flow of the music without causing disruption.   <br /> <br />I don't think you'll find any of the songs from Oneness on any of the Santana compilation albums and, this fact, coupled with lasting memories of this album finally convinced me to seek out the cd and acquire a new copy.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Picking Helen Mirren to play the queen was an act of genius but even her spectacular performance could not have saved a lackluster script. I find it quite an achievement that this movie was able to create a (sometimes) sympathetic portrait of a woman who fell out of public favor in many circles after Princess Diana's death.<br /><br />  All the politics of the situation are played out in detail, giving a look at how the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and Mirren did a certain amount of dancing around the situation and the tensions there. The Queen was criticized for her stiffness and lack of emotion, but somehow this film manages to show the cracks in that rigid facade, doing so with a certain modicum of wit and grace. Also, I found myself surprised that the film actually made me think about the possible  benefits of a certain amount of reserve and decorum, commonly known as the \\"stiff upper lip\\", although I still feel there was far too much coldness on the Queen's part after the Princess died. It is a small miracle that the film manages to make her the slightest bit sympathetic, especially considering the bias many may feel against her because of her actions after Diana's death.<br /><br />  However you feel about the terrible events of Princess Diana's tragic accident and the events that followed, this movie is a superb portrayal of a woman who may be far more complex than believed. Watch it the first chance you get!
0440238609|5.0|i loved this, and zipped right thru it.  i would say it is 100 percent suited for adults, and even though i don't like fantasy i liked this.  i found it a little sexist, but not more than other books for teens, and i appreciated the anti-narnia ideas.  mostly, tho, it is just interesting and well-written.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I must admit that I was somewhat skeptical of a different actor portraying the role of James Bond. But I felt that way when Pierce Brosnan first played the role too. I would say that Daniel Craig did a superb job in Casino Royale. Daniel Craig's acting style (persona if you will) was a wonderful marriage with the way in which his lines and story were written. The black and white sequence at the beginning was a clever touch to the movie. And definitely set the dark tone for it. Casino Royale was definitely an edge of your seat movie. My Fiance', having never really seen any of the newer Bonds, loved this movie. She thought that it was quite intense and very exciting. I was only too thrilled to hear that, but I don't think that the Brosnan Bonds are nearly this caliber. I truly hope that Craig has signed on for a few movies at least. <br /> <br />Again a great Bond!
B000GY729M|5.0|I listened to Hot Fuss and Sam's Town pretty much simultaneously, as I borrowed both CDs from a friend. I was hooked instantly, enough to go out and buy both albums for my own collection. I understand what some people are saying about the sounds being very different on each album, but as with all my favorite artists, The Killers have evolved and matured in a positive way. There is NOT a disconnect between the albums...they maintain a style and sound that is definately their own. But they have grown and changed and some people simply hate change. This is the best band to come along in eons. Well worth the money you spend to buy it. My favorite tracks are \\"Sam's Town\\", \\"When You Were Young\\" \\"Bling\\" and \\"Read My Mind\\". For \\"Read My Mind\\" I also recommend getting the single, as there are some electronic remixes reminiscent of the Hot Fuss sound.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|If you read my review on the dvd, that is why I also picked up the cd, plus you get 3 additional songs that are live. I wanted to be able to listen to the music I enjoyed on Pbs in my car so I bought the cd.
B000068FUM|5.0|<br />Sweetly chagrined rock and romantically whimsical alt, the Jayhawks finest CD.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|While I loved the movie, I strongly suggest you read the book as well. There are differences between the two and, of course, verbal descriptions of characters' thoughts are often hard to reproduce on screen. Almost always, sacrifices must be made in the script - and this film is no exception. However, I DO feel the movie stays true to the INTENT and MESSAGE of the book and it is quite a wonderful film.<br /><br />  It is futuristic and if you know anything about the author of the book on which this film is based (P.D. James) you'll know this isn't her usual mystery story. But it is one of my favorite works that she has written, telling of a time when people are infertile and of the hope that resides when there is a chance that someone can produce children again.<br /><br />  The government gets involved and there are political messages and subplots, all set against a certain, dark atmosphere. This film will make you think and I actually find the possibility of a future where infertility is almost the norm not outside the realm of possibility. Even if you don't, the \\"What ifs?\\" will keep you interested in this masterful film and Clive Owen proves that he is  becoming more interesting an actor as time goes on.
B000HT386M|5.0|Didn't think much of it. But gave it a chance and it really turned out to be a good movie.

B0000A1HQP|5.0|This is by far the funniest French movie ever released (at least in my humble opinion). This comedic masterpiece is the result of an extremely well written script where the comedy arises from the different situations and the sequence of events rather than from slapstick or clowning comedy that produces an instantaneous laughter gratification that is forgotten afterwards. <br /> <br />The movie was meant to be watched and understood in its original language to truly be enjoyed. Although the movie has English subtitles, you will not like it as much if you do not understand French well. <br />
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Wow. Where to begin. I first saw them on a Pbs special and I really enjoyed the music. The women have amazing voices. Well since I enjoyed the tv special I bought the dvd of it when it was made available. If you enjoy celtic style music, both traditional and modern, you should pick this up.
1416914285|1.0|[Moderate spoilers ahead, beware, beware!] <br /> <br />City of Bones was an incredibly frustrating book. <br /> <br />Holly Black - an author whose work I'm rather fond of - called it \\"funny, dark, and sexy.\\" Was it funny? Absolutely. Was it dark? There was a lot of killing, but only of nameless monsters - it was about as dark as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, season 1. (Which is to say, not very.) As for sexy? There are two kisses in the entire book, and neither of them could be described as particularly sexy. Huzzah for romance!, yes, but not sexy. <br /> <br />Now, moving on. <br /> <br />An urban fantasy in which a young artist named Clary goes clubbing and sees a cute guy attack people with claws and get murdered. Unfortunately, by the time her adorably nerdy best friend Simon brings the bouncer to check on it, the body's vanished, and no one seems to be able to see the murderers. Then, later, she attends some poetry readings where people wail about their loins, and gets stalked by one of the murderers who seems intent on lounging about invisibly, talking about how good-looking he is, and belittling her a lot. She goes home to find her mother's vanished, and a demon like an alligator from the sewers crossed with a hairball ready to eat her face. <br /> <br />It had some good dialogue, (nothing particularly quotable, but funny at varying points - not unlike Jennifer Crusie in her better novels, only without the sex) a fast-paced plot, and very varied characters. That being said, the writing is stuffed with errors like \\"bending like a blade of grass bending sideways\\". There is an overabundence of similes as well, meaning that \\"as if\\"s, \\"as though\\"s, and \\"like\\"s are found in plenty. Usually, this doesn't bother me much, but when there are three to every page, it grows extremely tiresome. Her prose is clear - if not particularly inspired - but those similes may make you skip them in chunks. <br /> <br />What bothered me most about it was the exposition-heavy dialogue.There was nothing remotely subtle about it, though it usually came under the guise of telling the new Shadowhunter Clary about their world. On the other hand, heavy exposition tends to slow down the narrative, and City of Bones certainly slowed down a lot. Despite the fact that all the exposition was of a subject typically interesting to me - how to kill demons, types of weapons to kill demons, demons themselves, the characters' Pasts of Pain (TM) - the blatant obviousness of the ploy made me want to toss the book across the room. <br /> <br />Neither should you pick up this book if you're looking for a subtle read. The author doesn't hesitate to hit you with brief, immediate emotional descriptions: \\"she was stunned.\\" \\"he felt nauseous.\\" and so on and so forth. The characters may lie to each other, but Clary - who seems to be a very perceptive sort except when it pertains to her best friend Simon - seems to find it easy to spot those lies immediately. But those occasions where it's necessary for Clary to pick up on something aren't as common as they could be, though not for the best of reasons; for the most part, they tell each other painful truths from their pasts immediately. You find out fairly quickly about Jace's tragic past and rapidly identify him as the anti-hero who conceals his inner pain with witty ripostes. (He tells Clary a bit of it as a bedtime story, and you might think that this can be explained by the fact that he is minorly obsessed with her. On the other hand, when a minor character who doesn't even like them tells them about a vicious incident involving his father in his childhood, you know something's up.) <br /> <br />And then, of course, there is Alec, whose secret Clary notices pretty much immediately, though adults who've known him all his life can't see it. It would matter less if she were marketed as perceptive, but it doesn't feel as though she is; her nature seems to happen by accident, a convenience for the author to let on more abouther characters. <br /> <br />The people who are good tend to fall into varying shades of gray. Unfortunately, the antagonist receives no such treatment. He abused his son emotionally! He gathered loners while he was going to school and made friends solely in order to have loyal followers! He hates all demons indiscriminately and wants them all razed off the face of the earth! There's what seems to be a half-attempt to explain his evil towards the end of the book, but it's never explored very much, and honestly doesn't alleviate any of his evil into something that even resembles humanity. At present, the villain's not a character; he's a plot point on legs. <br /> <br />Many of the other reviews have already covered the romance angle, so I'll simply add that I agree with the ones who called it a Star Wars moment in an urban fantasy novel. There never seemed to be much depth invested in it; there were some minor sparks, but it was hardly given any build-up before Jace and Clary were kissing before her room, and Simon - in love with her for the past ten years* - opened the door be confronted with the pair of them. <br /> <br />Then, of course, he stormed off after throwing his love in her face, but came back to drive her to the Shadowhunters' next assignation with the forces of darkness. <br /> <br />* They've only known each other for ten years, mind. And they were five when they first met, I assume. When he tells her about the ten years, rather than sympathise with Clary and Simon, I rolled my eyes. He's been in love with her since the moment he knew her? <br /> <br />That's probably what I find most annoying about the whole thing. Character development wasn't carried off in the least - in one chapter, Clary definitively identifies herself with the human race - the \\"mundies\\", as Jace calls them, scornfully. Once the next arrives, she doesn't bother to defend her best friend Simon when the Shadowhunters mock him, and she's thinking of herself very much a Shadowhunter.Simon's just had his heart broken, and a few lines later all is well with the two of them again. Isabelle is mentioned to dislike Clary, but there seems to be nothing in it other than a few glancing lines of mild slighting. Alec, who dislikes her because Jace is straight and only a blind English teacher could fail to notice all the chemistry, concludes the first book fine with her. <br /> <br />(What I dislike most about this is the fact that Clary tells Alec, essentially, that the boy he has a crush on Jace - called him a coward for never having killed a demon. He hits her, and I felt rather vindicated for Alec, primarily because most of the cast is either indifferent to Clary or fond of her. Later, he comes back and apologises. She doesn't, and they both behave as if she stated some sort of truth. Jace himself says it - Alec's probably never killed a demon because he was too busy protecting Jace and Isabelle. That's not cowardice - that's secondhand glory, and Alec is incredibly brave for not wanting all the glamour when surely Isabelle and Jace must be pushed into his face all the time for being the great demonhunters that they are. That Clary is wrong and no one calls her on it deeply irritates me, particularly since I suspect that the reader wasn't meant to empathise with Alec in that situation.) <br /> <br />As well, there was the Really Old Cliche of the heroine being beautiful and not knowing it. Perhaps she's only beautiful in Jace's eyes - for Jace is the one who tells her so - but really, the amount of people who show up in fantasy books unaware of their own good looks is supremely annoying, and is not growing any less so. <br /> <br />The main reason I've picked it all to bits is because it could have been so much better. The writing was amateurish (the similes! they're massing for an attack!), the characters were barely fleshed out - you couldn't tell one's lines from another's, as if they were merely devices for throwaway one-liners - and the plot wasunfortunate. On the other hand, there were some funny bits, (\\"It's the Mortal Cup, Jace, not the Mortal Toilet Bowl.\\") but it didn't give a new look on vampires, demons, or werewolves the way Holly Black gave a new look on Faerie. It's funny, but for the readers who want more from a book than funny, it doesn't quite cut it. <br /> <br />The random first-person narrative section -- told to add depth to Clary's mother's story, I presume -- was unnecessary to the extreme. At the time the tale was being told, they were in terrible danger. The character in question chose that time to pause and to expound -- in depth -- on Clary's mother's history? As I said: highly, extremely, incredibly unlikely in a character. <br /> <br />There was also an unnecessary reference -- I say unnecessary because I've heard something about accusations of plagiarism, and since the author doesn't specifically cite the text when she makes the reference, I assume people will be all over it like stink on cheese? -- where Luke asks Clary not to call him Uncle Luke, because it reminded him of Uncle Tom's Cabin. As his name is not Tom, this doesn't quite work as well as it did in the text it came from originally: Fire and Hemlock, by Diana Wynne Jones. I seem to recall a few other instances, but nothing that hasn't been repeated through culture, or that sticks particularly in the mind. <br /> <br />To summarise an extremely long-winded review: City of Bones had excellent dialogue for humor. Unfortunately, that one shining point was rather bogged down by the places where it lacked. It shows promise, and the humor nearly makes you want to wait for it, but I had no problem putting it down to attend to work - and that, for me, was the sign that it didn't work as well as it should have.
6305736650|5.0|A beautiful love story, filled with memorable quotes, and a good movie to watch with someone you love.  There's a good reason why Casablanca is a true Classic.  Over the years I've seen bits & pieces of Casablanca and I know what the story is about.  But I had never actually sat down and watched the whole thing until I purchased this DVD.  And I'm glad I did, it was well worth the money and time.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot, despite some dubious plot twists and a gruesome interrogation/torture scene that left me feeling a bit queasy.  It will take some time getting used to Daniel Craig as Bond -- his interpretation of the man is different from any before -- but the movie generates plenty of tension in the second act, and there's lots of gorgeous scenery to enjoy along the way. Not a great movie, but a good one to be sure!

B000002MU3|2.0|I bought everything they did from Murmur up to AFTP. When I heard Monster, I liked WTFK, but then there was nothing tuneful after that. If you liked grunge, this is great, but if you like good tunes, then you want the earlier REM albums.

0684843749|4.0|\\"The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding\\" is an excellent reference for anyone engaged in weightlifting.  It is the most comprehensive book I have found on bodybuilding and is very well organized.  You can easily find any topic you have questions about.  Among the best parts of the book are the chapters on the functions of the various muscle groups.  This book has clear pictures and explanations on how to perform almost any exercise you can think of and also contains further diagrams of some exercises, such as Deadlifts, that can be dangerous if not performed properly. <br /> <br />The main weakness of this book is the suggested routines.  Even the Beginner's routines are insanely long.  As Arnold explains in this Encyclopedia, muscles do not grow during workouts but during the recuperation time between workouts.  Lifting weights 6 days per week, twice a day, while doing 5 sets per exercise and often 15-25 sets per body part will not allow those of us with average or less than average recuperative abilities to recognize our potential.  Only those with superior genetics like Arnold or those using mega-doses of steroids will make good long-term progress on these routines.  For the rest of us, I recommend \\"High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way\\" as a companion book with some great routines.  However, \\"High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way\\" is not as comprehensive in other areas so I recommend it in addition to, not instead of \\"The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding\\" is a must-have for anyone who wants to learn about basic nutrition and exercise technique; just throw out the suggested routines.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Astounding collection for anyone from any generation to listen to. Hard to top this 1.
B0009X7664|5.0|I saw the movie and read the book for the first time when I was in elementary school. Since then I have read the book a few more times and seen the movie probably another 50 times. In recent years many of the movie collections are combined with interviews with the original cast. One of my favorites is with Gregory Peck. Peck often said that the role of Atticus Finch was his very favorite role in his long career as an actor. Many will remember that when Brock Peters delivered the eulogy at Peck's funeral that he remembered Peck as a man who lived his life every day as Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck has always been one of my very favorite actors so this had great meaning for me to know that someone actually lead a principled life away from the stage. <br /> <br />The characters in the book are all very realistic for any community, not just a southern community. Racism and prejudice made be bolder and more pronounced in the south but it can be found anywhere. <br /> <br />The book is also an oustanding example of how to weave a story and interact the characters. The audience for the book is not limited to any particular age. I have enjoyed it throughout my life. The screenplay and the movie is also pure Americana. No library in the world should be without this movie and this book.
B00005JO20|5.0|One of my absolute favourite movies of all time and my best movie of 2005. I still recall my enchantment watching it in the theatre. Hands down, my best cinematic experience so far.      It is a visual delight, an edge of your seat thriller, a love story of every sort and a laugh out loud comedy all rolled into one marvellous package.     Peter Jackson is a genius. Spielberg is sooo yesterday. Peter Jackson is the new Steven Spielberg.    Before King Kong, Naomi Watts was one of those actresses I see a thousand times and never remember. In Kong, she shines like a true star. She is beautiful physically and in her spirit and actively so.    My favourite character however, just has to be the demented Carl Denham played to perfection by Jack Black who is no stranger to such roles but here, he takes it a notch further and it is a riot to watch his movie making passion degenerate into exploitative, desperate madness.    Adrien Brody does an expected and usual fine job of being the noble, quiet and brave hero. I like him a lot but he does nothing new here.    After watching it in theatres, I have seen this movie at least four or so times on dvd and each time is like the first time. Kong is a wonder. He is a hero and I love watching his love for Ann Darrow develop and blossom. His protectiveness is so endearing and the scene where Ann Darrow seeks his protection from the dinosaurs and Kong goes into alpha male mode shredding the dinosaurs to pieces is one of the highlights of the movie.    On dvd however, I haven't been able to re-watch the scene where Kong gets killed. I just cant bear it and I hurt with Ann Darrow.    I am very impressed by how tactfully and tastefully the relationship between Anna and Kong is treated. In our sex-drenched culture it could have easily degenerated into something perverse but it is instead sweet and affectionate.    Any movie starring the very talented Jamie Bell is always worth my while even though he got nothing more than a bit part.    Iwill be watching this dvd many more times and so should you.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|This movie, is an incredible light humored film that is filled with great lines and action.  <br />after watching the remake i had to see this. The cinematography is breathtaking and the cars make you want to cry when they crash. and for being a british film it is amazing

B00005MP58|5.0|A great movie to sit down and enjoy.  So moving and touching.  I would recommend this movie to everyone, and I would also recommend the newer one with Keira Knightley.
B00004RF83|5.0|This is an excellent film that is just as current now as it was when it came out during the early 1960's. This is a graphic example of manipulation, old boys clubs, tainted politics and even loose canons in positions of military leadership. It even lends one to take a closer look at political leaders who have military experience in their backgrounds because this often leads to gunboat diplomacy and the big stick stigma. The cloak and dagger cliches are also found throughout the movie.  <br /> <br />There is an outstanding cast with Kirk Douglas as an investigative boatrocker with not one ounce of quit in his bones. Burt Lancaster is also very convincing as the general who wants to be a modern Caesar. Ava Gardner is also charming as the female who travels in all the circles of power. These characters are very evident in any society. It strengthens the argument to seperate military and civilian leadership from each other because the passions will always run deep. <br /> <br />The film should be required viewing for all military officers.

B000067J1Q|4.0|I've heard about \\"The Sound of Music\\" most of my life, but I never really took the time to watch it until recently. Even though it's a long movie, almost 3 hours, I found it very entertaining. When Maria and Captain Von Trapp got married, I thought that was the end. But to my surprise the movie continued on with a darker note when the family escapes from the Nazis. So what started out as lighthearted and fantastical ended as scary and realistic.  Even though Christopher Plummer is a very handsome man and a fine actor, I found him to be a very dull singer, but other than that \\"The Sound of Music\\" is a great movie
1582701709|5.0|Recently I heard on my morning talk show them discussing the Secret in a way to say it was for guiliable people. But they were missing the point of the book helping you to focus on thinking & feeling positive. It's not the point on \\"wishing\\" for things, but for you to focus on getting them for yourself.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is my most favorite movie.  In my opinion, it is better than the one from 1996.  Although the one from 1996 describes what happened more in the book, this one touches my heart more and Elizabeth and Darcy seem to have more chemistry together.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.

Beyond simply that book you don't want to put down, KC is a tell-all of those things we try not to think about when eating out. But rather than make the reader want to shun the restaurant scene, it almost makes you want to go out and catch the restaurant staff in all the little games Bordain reveals.

0800177177|1.0|I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars. <br /> <br />If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him.
B000EXZI28|5.0|I think one of the wonderful things about this album is the diverse nature of the material that they cover.  Yes the voices sound like the bee gees but they don't allow themselves to stuck in a stylistic rut.
B0009MA8V0|1.0|I'm not a fan of this group at all (other than the album Warning. I like Warning), but I decided I'd give them ONE more chance after suffering through Dookie. Oops, my mistake. Of course, Billie Joe Armstrong STILL cannot sing, but that's not exactly news. He can't exactly make good music, either.<br /><br />Yes, there's a bit of experimentation - Extraordinary Girl had a cool worldbeat thing going on at the start, but quickly melted (for lack of a better term) into the group's usual unvarying power-trio look-at-us-we're-pop-punkers formula I know all too well. But unoriginality's still the name of the game - Are We the Waiting kicked off with a drum solo lifted from When the Levee Breaks, and Give Me Novocaine has a drum intro ripped off of Are We the Waiting. So they rip off their Led Zeppelin ripoff. Interesting...<br /><br />Okay, I haven't even gotten to the most annoying parts of American Idiot yet. No, it's not even the four awful hits that are contained here (the unusually political title track and Holiday, whose big statements - America is practically run by the media and the Iraq War is going wrong - aren't exactly big-time relevations; Wake Me Up When September Ends, smarmy even by their standards; the ludicrously overplayed Blvd. of Broken Dreams, an unlistenable self-pity fest in the form of a power ballad), though those are close. No, I'm talking about the two nine-minute \\"epics\\" (Jesus of Suburbia, Homecoming) which rummage through a pile of different parts that sound conspiciously alike (as usual, they sacrifice creativity and technical skill for speed and volume) while trying to tell some sort of story. But the story's just plain BORING - more of the \\"I'm a whiny suburban kid who's mad at my mom because she won't take me to the mall\\" dreck that makes up a big part of why I hate this band. Sorry Billie Joe, but you ain't Pete Townshend, and American Idiot ain't Tommy. And, of course, none of these guys can play their instruments. But you knew that.<br /><br />Okay, when am I gonna stop being so negative? Right now. I actually LIKED the closing song, Whatsername, surprisingly tuneful for the band. But to hear it you'll have to suffer through the rest. No thanks..., when am I gonna stop being so negative? Right now.

B000N6U0E2|1.0|Are they kidding?  This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.  This fool violates the first rule of investing, by spending his life savings on those machines that he then has trouble selling.  Then his dream to transform his life:  to be a stock broker.  Give me a break.  How bourgeois.  And once he was a success, no mention is made about what he did with that money to say...help the homeless since he was one for sometime. <br /> <br />And all the Thomas Jefferson quotes, what does a slave-owning aristocrat really know about freedom? <br /> <br />The American dream in this movie is one of the false values this society actively promotes.  Don't fall for it! <br /> <br />Save your money and watch something with some value, like I Love Huckabees.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|...being well over 70+ to me this somewhat landmark cinematic glimpse by Mr. Mitchell reflects so so so much .... one cannot but be moved by the visions cemented on celluloid, etc. etc.<br /><br />I would be interested to be this boy's muse .....would be fascinating to guide him through the maze of 1939, 1914, 1812, 1776 .........<br /><br />..not quite the European ['Lulu'?] view of verite, but getting there .....somewhat like the embryo in Kubrick's 2001?
0618551050|5.0|Excellent Book!  It should be required reading for all graduate physics students!  However, it is written at a level that any math/science enthuist can understand the content.  The author does a excellent job of explaining very complex subjects in a simple manner. <br /> <br />I find this book refreshing in this world of conformity in science.  He explains that we must promote and search for different view points and in the search for truth to the major problems in physics.  When we restrict our research to a new mathmatical model and fail to continue our expermental research, we are limiting our view to a solutions that are infinite in number and have no basis in fact!  The author is a strong supporter of the drive to do smart experimental science as a basis to find facts that can be used to reduce this infinite number of mathmatical models into a final true general theory. Great book to create new ideas and direction in physics.

B000E1YVZU|5.0|If you love musicals, or even just like them...Rent is the way to go. I've never watched something with such power and emotion through song. All the actors are on point with every part of the movie, capturing what Jonathon Larson once created. I'm glad Chris Columbus decided to get the majority of the OBC in the movie - i don't think the magic would've been there if he had went with the original idea of the like of Christina, Justin and Beyoncé. <br /> <br />This DVD, is also worth getting just for the 2hr documentary on Jonathon and Rent. It is an unbelievable piece, and that will make you think twice about your life, and make you want to follow your dreams.
076781214X|5.0|First, I can't believe how shallow, misinformed, obtuse and insensitive Tom Keogh's editorial review is.   <br /> <br />\\"Peggy Sue Got Married\\" is a wonderful, funny, heartfelt and somewhat haunting story about how the ghosts of high school affect us throughout our lives.   <br /> <br />Kathleen Turner's performance, as a woman who time-travels back to her last year of high school, is nothing short of a brilliant.  It's a physical marvel - the way Turner transforms, through her subtle facial gestures and mannerisms, back into the body of a teenager.  Faced with the awesome possibility of being able to relive high school, knowing what she knows now, Peggy Sue behaves like anyone would given the chance.  What would you say to your grandmother, now dead?  What about the boy you're going to marry, and who you later divorce?   <br /> <br />The movie is very touching, and also very funny, and is definitely the last great film that Francis Ford Coppola made.  Coppola was, by 1986, in a very tumultuous period in his career - wasting his time developing cinematic technology and experimental narratives that derailed his career.  With \\"Peggy Sue Got Married,\\" Coppola had a great story, a great actress, and he simply decided to make a great film.   <br /> <br />\\"Peggy Sue Got Married\\" is one of the best films of mid-1980s.

At any rate..great film..i cant wait for the next one...oh and the dvd has some nice extra's..but it's the film that rules.  Whoever gave me an unhelpful on this review has obviously never seen this movie or is an fing idiot...uh you too ma'am.

Definately check out the first album if you haven't already, i don't know i just feel there's more energy coming from that one.  My rating of 3.5 stars means its on the higher end of and average album.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My daughter can watch this movie over and over, and so can I. Very good movie.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I saw this movie twice in the theaters, and it was so good that I pre-ordered the DVD and have watched it countless times since I got it. It's one of those movies that literally TELLS you what all the twists are through strategically placed clues and hints, but they still have a way of surprising you with at least ONE of the twists. Don't watch this movie trying to piece things together, because you might miss something. Plus, it ruins the feel of the movie if you're trying to decipher it. <br /> <br />The characters are PERFECTLY developed (much more than the book), and the actors are of course amazing. It's best if you watch it twice, though, because then you're more likely to catch all the clues and hints that you missed the first time around, and you gain MORE of an appreciation of how much expertise and detailed planning was put into such an amazing film. <br /> <br />SEE THIS MOVIE! And buy it from Amazon ... they're cheap and they ship quick! lol.  :)
B000002U9W|4.0|Contrary to popular belief amongst all of those classic rock fans who've been educated by their local classic rock station, Pink Floyd existed before the release of their 1973 album \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" A band that had made a huge transition from the psychedelic tendencies of the brilliant, yet drug addicted Syd Barrett, much of the early years of Pink Floyd were spent bumbling around in the dark, trying to find the sound that would put them on the right track. <br /> <br />I, for one, respect the hell out of these years for the Floyd. They were rewarded for their persistence and experimental nature which helped create their sound. Atom Heart Mother is one particular case of this happening. <br /> <br />This album is highly degraded by the band themselves nowadays... David Gilmour has stated on a couple of occasions his disgust for this record, and other members of the band have as well. Drummer Nick Mason's criticism of the album is much more restrained than the others, as he has noted that many of the elements, such as the long instrumentations and styles later found in DSoTM and Wish You Were Here, were first started with this album. <br /> <br />The name of the album came from a headline in a British newspaper which told of a news story about a pregnant woman who had recieved an atomic pacemaker. The cover of the album, a cow in the English countryside, was a specific request from the band to designer Storm Thorgerson to provide them something that would deflect from the overall theme of the album, which would allow them to be more creative with their music. Thorgerson went for a drive, and shot the first mundane thing he saw, a cow standing in a pasture. <br /> <br />Here is the list of tracks: <br /> <br />1. Atom Heart Mother Suite (23:44) (Waters, Gilmour, Wright, Mason, Geesin) <br />2. If (4:31) (Waters) <br />3. Summer '68 (5:29) (Wright) <br />4. Fat Old Sun (5:24) (Gilmour) <br />5. Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast (13:00) (Waters, Gilmour, Wright, Mason) <br /> <br />The opening track, on the vinyl version of this album, took up all of the first side. A very experimental and long track, composer Ron Geesin, an aquaintence of Roger Waters, was brought in with a full orchestra backdrop to add to the song. The track is somewhat dragging, definately sprawling, and a little pretentious, but it's not hard to recognize the talent in the piece. Gilmour's guitar was solid throughout the composition, and while not really leading to any place in particular, the Suite definately keeps you engaged throughout, and is an impressive, if not somewhat confusing track. <br /> <br />The middle tracks are individual songwriting contributions from the band. Waters' \\"If\\" is a folky, somewhat mocking ballad. Wright's \\"Summer '68\\" seems to me to be a mix of The Kinks and The Beatles, taking elements of both and rolling it into one. Of the solo compositions in the album, I enjoyed this one the most, as well as the fact that it's probably the strongest of the three in it's presentation. Gilmour's \\"Fat Old Sun\\" is a nostalgic song of the days of youth. He'd hit this theme later on as well, at the end of the Floyd's run with the song \\"High Hopes\\" from The Division Bell. The songwriting of Fat Old Sun is very personal, but weak in comparison with later Floyd compositions. The end guitar solo is quite good, existing also a sign of things to come. <br /> <br />The final track \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" continues where Atom Heart Mother Suite leaves off, throwing caution to conventional music. The song, complete with background noises of Pink Floyd roadie Alan Stiles preparing and eating his breakfast, is broken into three musical parts. The music itself is quite good, but a tad underwhelming. The last part of the song, titled \\"Morning Glory\\" is the strongest part of the song, and brings the album to a strong close. <br /> <br />Overall, one cannot fully understand a musical act until they expose themselves to the humble beginnings. Pink Floyd rose meteorically to their stardom... they once found themselves trying new things, and creating a formula for success. It's important, especially in the Floyd's case, not to ignore the importance of the first few albums. <br /> <br />Atom Heart Mother maybe chided as the worst Pink Floyd album by a few. But it's not. It's not their best either. It's one of my favorite, and one of their most important albums, as it really got the ball rolling in their evolution from psychedelic to progressive themes of rock.
0375704027|5.0|The narrator in this novel is Toru Watanabe, a student living in Tokyo in 1969-1970. His story is his relationship with two women. The first one is called Naoko, a sensitive person with a troubled personality since the suicide of her childhood friend Kizuki. Toru falls deeply in love with Naoko but she cannot come to terms with her depressive moods and soon has to be hospitalised at the Ami Hostel mental institution where her mentor Reiko tries to cure her. The other woman in Toru's life is Midori who is the opposite of Naoko: a sexually liberated young woman with a petulant and exuberant character. <br />A beautiful blending of the music, the atmosphere and the ethos which were predominant in the late 1960s with the story of Toru, a college student's erotic coming of age. The novel beautifully relates a young man's first, hopeless and romantic love. <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|Since other reviewers have already extensively covered the contents of these discs, let me add instead what stood out to me: 1) the design of the packaging, 2)  the DVD menu interface, and 3) the series itself!<br /><br />1) The packaging is AWESOME.  Distinctive and futuristic in that fabulous Sci-Fi Era way, while still being entirely utilitarian.  It holds the DVDs securely and safely stowed inside the plastic shell.<br /><br />2) The menu interface is great ~ one of the best I've seen on a DVD in a long while.  Easy to navigate and filled with little features I didn't expect to find, like trailers for each episode.  WOW!<br /><br />3) Obviously if I wasn't a die-hard ST fan I wouldn't have spent the money on the entire first season.  ;-)  However this really IS a great show, with far more morals and far LESS gratuitous sex and violence than what is on TV today.  It is an adult show that I don't feel guilty letting my kids watch with me.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this.  If I could give this 10 stars I would.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This release seems to have drawn out more eloquence and expertise from Amazon reviewers than most.  It is clearly warmly regarded as a classic by the great majority.  PC issues, or rather the non-PC issues have been debated with well-conceived and finely delivered statements by both sides.  As is usually the case in such matters, I don't imagine that the disputants have moved an inch from their original positions--or ever will.  As for myself, I hold sufficiently warm feelings for Disney's \\"Peter Pan\\" to endorse the many five-star ratings it has already earned.<br /><br />I clearly remember seeing \\"Peter Pan\\" during its first run, once at a grand and lordly downtown movie palace on San Francisco's Market Street and again, a little later, in second-run at a neighborhood theater on Mission Street.  I was ten years old at the time and recollect that the movie was a thing of considerable interest among my friends and schoolmates.  The consensus of opinion among discerning ten year-olds was positive but not ecstatic.  Much the same was true for the reviews that ran in the old News, Call-Bulletin, Examiner and Chronicle newspapers.  (Why was I pouring over movie reviews in four daily papers at the age of ten?  I have no idea, but there you are.)<br /><br />The big advertising hook for the film was that FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER!! Peter Pan would be portrayed by a boy rather than a middle-aged woman.  We ten-year olds were, as I recall, singularly unmoved by that.  Most of us were particularly well disposed toward Hans Conried's Captain Hook and to the Crocodile, of course.  Both were authoritatively pronounced to be real zorch.  (A San Francisco nonce-word invented by a then-popular disk jockey.  It quickly gave way before the better known \\"cool.\\")<br /><br />On the other hand, we moppet film critics also generally agreed with our  elder professionals who held that \\"Peter Pan\\" represented an artistic falling off from Disney's earlier masterpieces, \\"Pinocchio,\\" \\"Dumbo,\\" and especially \\"Bambi,\\" all of which had been re-released within our time horizons.  (I'm pretty sure that the next re-release of  \\"Snow White\\" was much later.)  Compared to those true classics of animation, we thought \\"Peter Pan\\" looked cheap, cheesy and flat--although I'm sure we didn't use those particular terms, relying instead on the ever-eloquent, \\"It was OK, I guess.\\"<br /><br />In 1955 came the first black and white TV version of the New York musical with Mary Martin.  It returned in a new live (on kinescope for the West Coast) version and again in 1960, that time in color, I think.  As I remember it, that version had much greater impact.  Mary Martin was simply better at everything than Bobby Driscoll was at anything.  The musical score was better, too--brasher and edgier than the Disney tunes, which even in 1953 were moving well along the path to the familiar musical pap so beloved by Uncle Walt.<br /><br />That was then, this is now.  Mary Martin's three \\"Peter Pans\\" are mere historical artifacts, while this \\"Peter Pan,\\" like its hero, shall remain forever fresh and young.mbo,\\" and especially \\"Bambi,\\" all of which had been re-released within our time horizons.

1582701709|3.0|This was not new information for me so I may not be the person to review this book. But I found the book to be a good discussion of how we create our own world. We are responsible for what happens to us. So it is.
B000J103PC|4.0|Lets face it. When you get into the \\"real world\\", to land a job that you want, you are going to go through hell just to get what you desire. Thats what this movie was about. That is what this movie was about, a lady named Andy landing a job as a journalist for a fashon company in New York City, and learns the hard way how to follow directions. Then she is being treated like crap and still has the strength to keep her job. It's real hard for her at first, but she learns the works and manages to keep her job, especially when she had to go get the typed manuscript for the Harry Potter book, that wasn't even printed yet. Also she chooses her job over friendships, in which comes back later on in the movie. Although this is just a movie, it somewhat teaches people (especially soon to be college graduates) on what can be expected at a job that they want at the entry position. You have to move heaven and earth just to please your boss, and he (or in this movie, she) won't even acknoledge you. I also did like the clothes that most of the actors wore. I bet most of the outfits costs at least $100,000. I believe living the life of a multi-millonare is overrated, and doubts anyone will enjoy it (not saying they want to live it though). As I said, this movie does give a little insight on what it is like working for a company such as the one shown in this movie. I think many people will enjoy it. I know I did.<br /><br />A word of advice: If you don't like your job, and your manager treats you like trash...just leave. Peace!

0465092756|5.0|This book achieves one of the most impressive displays of the strength of the scientific method, and how the various string theories failed to stand to its test - so far, at least. The book's title could not be more appropriate: it correctly describes that all of the variations of string theories presented so far fail miserably to stand to the stricter tests of the scientific method, particularly the ability to make verifiable predictions. If you are impressed with string theory and the possibility that it might embody the long searched Theory Of Everything (TOE), then read this book - and think twice.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|This is defiantly the best Bond move to come out so far.  The fighting in it was much better then with Pierce Brosnan (I realize that doesn't say a whole lot, but it is really good anyways).  I like how he didn't have to use all these strange and impossible to make gadgets.  The only slightly negative things I could think of to say about it is the Aston Martin doesn't get enough screen time and that when you think the movie is almost over you find out there is more to the story which makes it feel a little longer then it is. <br /> <br />All in all this is a great movie that any action movie lover will enjoy, regardless of wither or not they liked any of the other Bond movies (because I don't really care for them).

B000GFLKF8|2.0|While Denzel turns in a decent performance as always it is far short of his best work. If you have seen man on fire or deja-vu, this will seem down right tepid. Likewise Willem Dafoe a sometimes brilliant actor ie (apocalypse now, boondock saints) also seems to be sleeping through his performance. Jodie Foster is a pleasure as an icy cool hard as nails *itch. A departure for her that Im sure she enjoyed. Clive owen is absolutely brilliant as the mastermind and never loses control of his performance. With all this talent, this film has the potential to be great, but in fact falls so short that I really have no need to watch it again. Hostage with Bruce Willis or firewall with Harrison Ford were far better movies of this sort. And Spike Lee's need to bring racial undercurrents to every movie he makes, shows that racism doesnt belong to any one race and gets tiresome quickly. I am a man of mixed racial heritage who grew up in Detroit and has lived in Boston and New York City and my world bears little resemblance to the one Spike seems to think he lives in. In the end its a good rental just to see Clive Owen and Jodie Foster but certainly not worth buying.
B000002UDG|5.0|Awesome CD. I think some of Paul's best music was with Wings. Excellent music.  I remember when a lot of these songs came out in the mid to late seventies.  They are as good now as they were then.  These classics will always be listened to.  \\"Coming Up\\" and \\"a little luck\\" are two of my favorites on this CD. The music is really original, nothing out there sounds like it. <br />
B000E5N684|5.0|Sharon Stone is so confident in her character as Catherine Trammel in this film, and portrays some of the best sex and orgasm I've seen in a blockbuster movie before.  It is fun to see all the explicit scenes of sex, nudity and violence all rolled into one movie.  The story unravels with perfect rhythm, keeping your senses titillated all along the way.  It is timeless in its' plot, the murder mystery that even at the end never seems to be solved completely.  The viewer is left seduced, allured, and looking back on the different scenes and characters trying to figure out exactly what just happened.<br /><br />Michael Douglas does a terrific job in his role as detective Nick Curran.  He's on top of his game one moment, and the next completely clueless, giving in to the pleasures of drinking and smoking after months of sobriety.

B000LC55F2|5.0|Excellent movie.  It has so many twists and turns, it truly is a magician's movie - you feel like you're getting tricked through out.  I had to watch it twice, it is quite complex, well thought-out storyline.  The relationship between Robert and Alfred builds from the beginning of the movie, and the worst attributes of rivals is revealed as the story unfolds.<br /><br />David Bowie does a guest appearance as Tesla, which is a very interesting part of the movie.  It demonstrates the beginning of a transformation that was occurring during that period of time.  Scarlet Johannsen is lovely to watch, and portrays her character as the beautiful assistant flawlessly.  The scenes of London are true to form for the turn of the century, including the lighting, costumes, and overall feeling of the city.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie, great entertainment and challenging for the mind.

B00000J2PH|5.0|This was one of my first CDs that I got for Christmas back in '96. The issue of mine doesn't have the bonus tracks or remastered sound, though. Tapestry is the album that made Carole King a household name and it also made her more famous. It's quite obvious that most people had this title in their record collections back in the day, and it was a must have for many folks. She had released an album in 1970 called Writer, but that title was largely overlooked. However, things got a lot better for Carole King when Tapestry hit the stores in 1971. This is obviously her signature album that a lot of people would immediately identify her with. Upon its initial release, it was such a success that it was at the top of the charts for at least fifteen weeks and stayed on top of the charts for most of the rest of the 70s. This is without any doubt one of the most famous and most well known albums in the history of American music entertainment. A lot of these songs I like, especially I Feel the Earth Move and It's Too Late. She had released a few more albums in the '70s after Tapestry, but has kept a low profile in recent years. This is also the kind of album that will go on for many, many more years to come. Carole is one of my favorite singers and she has a beautiful voice.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|The first thing you will notice is the color scheme. Gold has been replaced by platinum (silver) surrounding the screen. The yellow function key [f] and its related commands are now reddish (actually a burnt orange). The weight of the model is the same as my twenty-plus year old model (Why was I afraid it would be lighter?). But the processor speed is a substantial improvement. This is what all the fuss should be about. A monthly mortgage payment calculation - $210,000 at 6.125% for 20 years, end of the month - takes 2 seconds (-$1519.69)on the original model. On the new edition this answer flashes instantly. Calculating the yield to maturity (YTM) for a municipal bond trading at 101.25 with a 4.25% coupon for 20 years takes 20 hum-de-dum seconds (\\"running...running...running\\") on my scratched-up 'old buddy'. This answer comes in just 3 merciful seconds (4.16%) on my new model. HP, you have done good.<br /><br />This 25th anniversary calc comes with a beautiful leather case-folder with a plastic window for your business card. The case is twice the thickness of the old soft leather dust cover. It fits into my inside jacket pocket, but its thickness may take a little getting used to (HP: why not a belt clip?).
0743496728|3.0|I am a big fan of Jodi Picoult and have loved many of her earlier works, especially My Sister's Keeper and Plain Truth. However, I found this book to be very disappointing. It reads as if she had taken a dare to work as many current adolescent issues as possible into one book: bullying, abusive boyfriends, etc. (I also think she took a dare to try to work the name Whit into a book-not one but two characters with this unusual name.)The story seems mostly a rehash of the Columbine incident, many situation mirror things that happened there almost exactly. I don't want to spoil the ending but I will say it came right out of left field and then, even though it shouldn't have been, everything was fine for Judge Alex Cormier. If you want to read a truly terrific book on the same topic try We Need To Talk About Kevin.

B000K7UBTI|5.0|Despite some of the harsh criticism this got, I personally thought this was a great film. Not only with a well plotted & mature storyline but also the well above average animation that's been lacking in a lot of Marvels' previous animated endeavors. This film pretty much tells the origin of Tony Stark from playboy philanthropist to armored hero. This was just as great as Dr. Strange, Hulk v.s., & the Planet Hulk animated films. A+
0783225903|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies, chaos in it's finest hour of pure insanity. Has a mind of its own but can never be controlled just like the breathing air ducts. Throw in the kitchen sink and a man named Tuttle.
B000002OX7|5.0|this seems to be the favorite who album of many fine folks out there. why argue with them? they're right, you know. this is the who's best album. \\"baba o'riley,\\" and \\"won't get fooled again\\" are simply two of the greatest rock anthems ever recorded. \\"bargain,\\" is right up there, too. \\"behind blue eyes:\\" another all-time great. not a shabby thing about this album. i would place it in the top 50 albums ever made. daltrey's voice is at it's peak, townshend's songwriting and powerchords on the guitar are rock and roll heaven material, john entwhistle's bass in more prominent on this album than any other who album, and keith moon's drumming is divine madness, as usual. there are several cd options out there for this album. i think the 1995 remastered version is the one for me. be careful and stay clear of the original cd version. the sound on that one is very substandard. anything not dated 1995 or up on the back is to be avoided for the better sounding versions. just make sure you do get this album. it is not quite a life without it.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|One of my top 10 fave movies of all time and to see it on wide screen brings so much more depth to the viewer, how can you not concentrate on the backdrops, props, and green sky with 2 moons. WIZARD OF OZ in out of space, what more can you ask for? Oz and Id are the same person, being, hidden behind a curtain of fear. The future of STAR TREK and all other sci-fi movies, definitely took sci-fi to another level.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Even though, the departed may be considered brutal and bloody, it is an amazing movie. there is so much to it. the story line is intriguing and gets better each time you view it. The acting is excellent, leonardo dicaprio and jack nicholson both portray their characters with personality and reputibility. if you enjoy mob movies, and you enjoy mystery, drama, even dark comedy, then this movie is for you!
B000E6GBV2|4.0|This album is prety good, It's got some nice melodies, and nothing that's too abrasive. The vocal style is similar to My Morning Jacket, and by extension Pink Floyd with lots of echoes and a very ethereal sound in some places. The songs are not as wandering as MMJ, but you won't be able to hear one and not think of the other. \\"The Funeral\\" is my favorite track on the album.
B000K7UBTI|1.0|I watched this movie in hopes that it would somehow stand above the lackluster and manic Ultimates animated films but instead found something far worse. I'm not going to go into much detail, but suffice it to say Iron Man is a terrible movie wrought with cliches and unnecessary amounts of exposition. <br /> <br />The Chinese characters are all stereotypes who talk in obnoxiously cryptic manners and inherently know martial arts. The worst of which being the update of Professor Yinsen from Iron Man's origin, originally a brilliant physicist who assists in the construction of the original armor, now reduced to a yellowface, monk cliche who practices calligraphy whilst describing ancient Chinese legends to Stark. <br /> <br />The blend of CG and cel animation is ugly and reminded me of the nineties Silver Surfer cartoon when the techniques were first being practiced. Movements for CG characters are stiff and awkward and the graphics themselves look dated and videogame-y. The CG characters also appear to be always hovering over the cel animation, looking as if they're skating when they're supposed to be running. <br /> <br />Also, this really isn't a film about Tony Stark. This is a movie about the legend of The Mandarin and how the world is suppose to stop it - Tony just 'happens' to be there when it takes place. Except for the original armor; updated as an absurdly over-designed, weapon strapped tool for escape, all of his armors are already built, their existence treated with the simple explanation of, \\"These are exo-suits I've been building in secret!\\" They're also displayed with the utmost fan-service in mind (The audience is treated to glimpses of the Hulk-Buster and Ultimates suit to name a few) and seem to only fail, having absolutely no impact on the events of the film. <br /> <br />Beyond that, Tony's character is the victim of a seen-it-a-million-times father/son relationship and the over-arching theme of Tony learning to conquer his ego-centric personality goes nowhere. At one point he does actually announces that he's aware he needs to be a better person, blah blah blah, but the film ends with him more self-involved than before. <br /> <br />Anyhow, this movie sucks. Hopefully the live-action film will take what is certainly a rich character and do it justice.
B000059HB7|1.0|Full but painful disclosure compels me to own up to the fact that I had this all wrong. I had just bought a new DVD player, and I had been using a B&W movie for the hook-up. This was the only movie I had seen on the new player until popping in this version of Rio Bravo, which, as stated previously, had a sickly green tint to it. I discovered only after writing the first review that I of course had an incorrect hook-up. I fixed it and the movie plays great. My apologies to Duke and Stumpy.         Saw this movie during its first run as a nine-year-old and loved it. Still do. But the color reproduction on this DVD is scandalous, and bears absolutely no comparison to its original state. The rich, vibrant color of the original has been replaced by a Dr. Seussian green, making every character look as if they are suffering from sea sickness. This makes the movie unwatchable,despite its low cost.Thank God a new version is due out soon. Save your money for that one.
0307341542|5.0|You must be very careful when writing a review on a book such as this because the addition of a spoiler can and will absolutely ruin the story for others and one of the primary appeals of this odd read is the multiple surprises the reader will encounter.  I am not normally attracted to this sort of work and as a matter of fact avoid it.  But in this case my daughter (a sensitive and gentle individual) and my wife (a sensitive and gentle individual but a more jaded reader than my daughter) both read the thing and were absolutely horrified even though they could not put the book down.  This fascinated me so I read it.<br /><br />It is difficult to place this first novel by Gillian Flynn into a given category.  But I can tell you that on a purely emotional level this writer has her stuff together!  Witness the broad range of emotions voiced through the many reviews here!  Any author that can bring out so many very, very strong emotions is doing her or his job and doing it well!  I must admit to you that a great deal of this work horrified me...but like my wife and daughter, I simply could not put it down.<br /><br />The premise of the story is two murdered girls in a small Missouri Town.  The primary protagonist is a reporter working in Chicago but since the murders take place in her little home town, she is sent there by her editor to investigate.  Now note only is our heroine a reporter but she is one sick little puppy herself...she is a \\"cutter\\" who likes to carve words, some of them rather large, into her body.  I tell you this as an indication that when you read this work you will find a family (her family) of some of the most dysfunctional people you are likely to ever encounter in a literary work...good grief!  I was unable to fine one single character in this entire book that I liked.  This is the way it should be and this I feel was the author's intent...as I said...she did her job well!  What a nasty and unlikeable bunch of characters all gathered into one book!  Folks, this took some skill!<br /><br />Now there is psychological and physical cruelty found in this work but that was sort of to be expected in this type of novel.  What caught me completely off guard was the \\"hog farm\\" aspect.  The protagonist's family is rich...really rich and their fortune has been made though the industrial pig farms.  The author's lengthy and graphic description of how these animals are processed,  and treated before they even reach the slaughter house horrified my to no end and to be frank, even though I have visited such places in my real life, after reading the author's work I had bad dreams.  Arrrrgh!<br /><br />Flynn's writing is extremely graphic so those who have a weak stomach or a sensitive mind might want to avoid this one.  I will tell you truthfully though, even though the subject matter horrified and repelled me, the writing was so good that it was worth the pain it caused.  This author is good!<br /><br />There is a double ending to this one that will catch you completely off guard...goodness, what a devious mind this young author has.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksok!

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Reason 1- The action scenes are visceral and energized in a way that make the previous Bond movies look anemic by comparison. Purging the tedious vehicle chases, all of the action, from the opening fistfight in a dingy restroom, to the truly cringe inducing torture scene, are arresting and genuinely exciting. <br /> <br />Reason 2- The script is much more intelligent than the average Bond screenplay. Stripping away the more fantastical elements of recent entries, this one provides a meaty story, snappy dialogue, an actual character arc for Bond, a meaningful relationship with his girl (the lovely Eva Green), and a creepy villain. It also helps that the writers made Bond rely on his own wits and ingenuity to get out of a jam, rather than pulling out a miraculous gadget from \\"Q.\\" <br /> <br />Reason 3- Daniel Craig. Blond but definitely not bland, he more than proves his nay sayers wrong. Bringing to the role of Bond a raw intensity and a level of humanity that we have never seen before, he is ultimately the reason this movie works. His 007 sweats, bleeds, and falls in love. From every time he beats the tar out of some villain, to the tender scene between him and Vesper in the shower, he sells the role in a way that no other actor has been able to. To put it simply, CRAIG IS BOND. <br /> <br />As someone who slept through most of Brosnan's rather bland outings, I can say that Daniel Craig and Casino Royale have made me a Bond fan all over again.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Screen favorite Tom Hanks proves that even the most unlikely soul can change the world in the award-winning 1994 blockbuster \\"Forrest Gump\\". The movie chronicles the life of Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted but good-hearted Alabama man who has been present during significant historic events in the 20th century. In his life, Forrest Gump has been an All-American football star, a Vietnam War hero, a champion Ping-Pong player, a successful fishing tycoon and an inspiration for a whole generation. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future), \\"Forrest Gump\\" is a remarkably uplifting smash hit that ranks as one of the best films of the 1990s. Tom Hanks delivers his most entertaining acting performance. \\"Forrest Gump\\" features an unforgettable story, great special effects and terrific performances by Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field. The 142-minute blockbuster opened with overwhelming positive reviews, grossed over $650 million worldwide and earned six Academy Award wins including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor.<br /><br />\\"Forrest Gump\\" Collector's Edition is an absolute must-have for any DVD collection. The 1994 blockbuster is presented is its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The 2-Disc DVD contains an enjoyably well-defined video transfer and an excellent 5.1 Dolby digital sound. Its supplemental extras include two detailed audio commentaries by director Robert Zemeckis and crew, the 30-minute \\"Through the Eyes of Forrest Gump\\" documentary, behind-the-scenes and visual effects featurettes, trailers and picture gallery. Overall, \\"Forrest Gump\\" scores a winning \\"A\\".
0684800713|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this novel.  On one level I appreciate it for the fine literary work that it is.  In particular, I admire Hemmingway's  use of symbolism throughout the novel.  But at the same time, this isn't a novel I enjoyed reading.  The novel features a cast of characters that are not especially likable and the first third of the novel moves a little too slowly (Jake and his friends lead aimless lives -and the first part of the novel is pretty aimless).<br /><br />Jake and his fellow expatriates spend the entire novel getting drunk, being drunk, or recovering from having been drunk (or `tight' as they like to say).  They pass their days eating, drinking and being as insensitive as possible to one another.  It would be easy to dismiss these characters as unpleasant, and therefore uninteresting, but in the context of the years following WWI, I found myself feeling some sympathy for them.<br /><br />Simply put, they're damaged goods.  Jake, Mike, and Bill all fought in WWI(Jake becoming less of a man as a result) and were forever affected by it.  They are now lost, drowning their empty aimless lives in alcohol.<br /><br />Arguably, the most interesting character in the novel is Lady Ashley (Brett) who is a toxic influence on nearly every man she encounters.  Jake, Mike, and Cohn are all in love with her to varying degrees and pay an emotional price as a result.  Brett's self centered behaviour complicates the lives of the men who are enamored by her.  Jake, who is impotent because of the war, demonstrates his love for Brett by helping her pursue men and then picking up the pieces when the affair ends badly.<br /><br />There is no happiness for the lost generation in The Sun Also Rises and considerable irony in the novel's final sentence.  I found this to be an interesting and insightful novel but I can't say I really `enjoyed' reading it.  As a literary work this novel warrants 4 stars.  As entertainment: 2 stars.  Overall: 3 stars.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|There is not much I can say that has not been said already.  I believe these boys have done their homework!  Who says you can't bring back that 60's-70's old rock?  I think these boys are proof that it can be done...and done with style! bring it on!  Good Rock LIVES!
032147404X|5.0|Kelby makes available to the budding amateur photographer many of the powerful CS2 techniques that can turn mediocre-to-poor photos into great photos. <br /> <br />Instead of trying to explain the chapter and verse of Photoshop CS2, Kelby describes the specific methods, literally step-by-step, for handling the typical common situations and problems.  It is a kind of very effective bottoms-up approach to Photoshop.  While the reader may not understand all of the theory of layers and the myriad adjustments described in the book, the methods work and work well.  This methodology is also effective, I believe, in providing the necessary incentive to the reader to really learn what layers really do, for example, and how and why they are used. <br /> <br />I have found the book useful in my own quite amateur work, and continue  to learn more from it as time goes by.
B000A1ENCU|2.0|Quo Vadis? is one of the worst sepctacles ever made; D Kerr and Peter Ustinov are the saving graces here, Peter Ustinov as Nero, and D. Kerr with the harder task of being Robert Taylor's love ineterest, <br /> <br />And here is the issue with this film, Robert Taylor, possibly one of the worst actors ever to dare put his face on the screen. <br /> <br />He is too old, wooden as aways, very American sounding, and no talent at all. <br /> <br />What more can be said? He ruins all fims he is in, and yet was used over and over, because Hollywood was afraid he would tell more to the House on Un American Activities, for whom he supplied many many names. <br /> <br />An informer, liar, and blacklmailer, his career ended with MacCarthy, thank God. <br /> <br />Avoid this and all Taylor films; he's terrible, and terrible even without the facism.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Short and sweet (or not), THE MUSIC IS TERRIFIC- Neil at his prime. The DVD that comes with the set, on the other hand, represents the era of visual experimentation, where the cameraman is scrambling to come up with something \\"new\\", only to leave the viewer watching a reel-to-reel sitting in for Neil on stage half the time (i.e. leaning next to the piano, propped in the chair amongst the guitars and other instruments, reels going round and round), while the music plays on. The texture and ultra-high contrast of the film is really neat-o, if that helps. If I wanted this kind of excitement I could just turn to the side and stare at my wall, it would have been easier on the eyes. Cherish the CD, use the DVD as a frisbee.
0893860220|5.0|This book is a collection of recordings of conversations between Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, and vistors who came to see him at his Ashram in the slums of Bombay in the late 1960s.  <br /> <br />It's not for everyone. But if you're a thinking person, thoughtful and reflective, and have grown tired of philosophy because it's not giving you the answers you seek concerning the nature of reality, God, the Universe and everything; and if you're skeptical of various religious systems, and Buddhism is not working for you; and if you want read the teachings of someone who knows the ulitmate, someone who talks only straight, someone with no self-interest at all --  then may have come to the right place with this book.
0156027321|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend and, without reading the synop, I went for it. I was lost in the first few moments of the book, but then I really got into it, wondering what could possibly happen next. I loved how the main character always said \\"Richard Parker\\" and didn't make up a nick name for him. This is a different book than anything i have read... and I hope you too get a chance to read it.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Continuum by John Mayer is a great peice of music.  It smacks of the genre that I grew up with as far as the lyrics, music, and beat go. It made me want to listen to it, learn the words and sing along.  Remember doing that? <br /> <br />No \\"pops\\" or \\"whitenoise\\" but just as sweet and catchy as the music from days gone-by-but-not-forgotten.  You can actually buy this CD with my guarantee that you will like more than one song on it. <br /> <br />It's a steal too at the listed price; pricing even takes you back (although not quite as far as vinyl) to better days.
1401307450|5.0|In order to fully understand music, one must understand what's behind the musician's life. How can it be that such beautiful music is produced by someone with such a poor youth?  <br />This book is absolutely amazing. Contrary to other reviews, I don't think less of Mr. Kiedis after reading the book. When in such an ugly setting such as a slum in Los Angeles, Mr. Kiedis could consider himself lucky that he came out the way he did.  <br />I learned more than Kiedis' background after reading the novel, I also now know that I will never even consider doing drugs. I absolutely love this book, and I was up until 6 in the morning reading it the day I got it. I'd recommend this book to anyone. Astonishing!
1582701709|5.0|The Secret is so complete. I have read a variety of books that give bits and pieces of the secret, but, this book lays it all out in   such a concise manner. The book leads the way to truly understand and follow-through on all aspects, all ways one can benefit by following  The Secret. The reader must be willing to work with the book. The results can then be amazing.
B00004Z459|5.0|I bought this CD knowing one or two singles a long time ago, not expecting to be what i thought it was. Five years later, it remains my most played CD. This isn't one of those CDs that has two listenable songs and then the rest is filler, for every song is just as good as the others. It's not really metal, and it has bits and pieces of electronica and hip hop to mix it up so it doesn't get old.
1582701709|5.0|I have read many other books along this line & am so happy to see these ideas encompassed in one book! The mind is a very powerful thing as has been proven many, many times in many, many different ways so why can't anyone be a success the way The Secret explains? The author, Rhonda Byrne, found Scientific, Biblical, people from hundreds of years ago who believe and KNOW the mind is powerful, as well as modern day people and has done a wonderful job of putting it together in an easy and understandable format! Prayer, knowing, believing and practicing go hand in hand in reading, watching and/or listening to The Secret! The law of attraction has always been around!  Thank You One & All!!!
B000001E29|4.0|Tom Waits's THE BLACK RIDER is one of his most ecclectic albums...and that's saying a lot, as Waits fans well-know.  RIDER features instrumentals that are just as disturbing as some of the lyrics.  The saw in \\"November\\" will have you looking over your shoulder; the macabre<br /><br />recitation that opens the album will have you dreading what comes next.<br /><br />Written/arranged/compiled with sidekick Greg Cohen, as well as William Burroughs, RIDER comes off as a piece of art--a portrait all its own, where the sum of its parts merge to create a picture whose image is distorted and out of focus, but is no less beautiful.  RIDER is proof that a Tom Waits record is thoroughly a Tom Waits record; there are a couple songs here he doesn't even play on, yet you have no doubt that it is pure Tom Waits.  Tom Waits is not just a musical artist, he's a musical EVENT, and THE BLACK RIDER is the perfect example.  Still...for anyone just getting started with Waits's music, you might want to go elsewhere first.  RIDER is not for the uninitiated.
B000002UAF|5.0|A Hard Day's Night by The Beatles is their best earlier recordings. Standout tracks include: And I Love Her, Things We Said Today, I'll Be Back, I'm Happy Just to Dance With You, I'll Cry Instead, and If I Fell. John Lennon sings most of the songs on this album and he carries these impressive songs well. Paul has a chance to shine with probably the most overplayed Beatles song of all-time, Can't Buy Me Love. All the songs are Lennon/McCartney originals and George can be heard singing track number 4 which he does a wonderful job handling the lead vocals. I highly recommend checking this classic soundtrack out and the movie too. \\"When I'm home, everything seems to right...\\"
B000MTPANQ|5.0|If you have ever wondered why Neil Young is one of the best this CD will answer all of your questions.  This is the Neil Young that we all fell in love with.  This is the Neil who lives in our hearts.  This is the Neil that has made us weep and wonder.  Look no further-you have found your answer.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love Broadway shows....and I din't think I could love the movie more than the show! I did! The movie oozzes with romance and passion that I thought the show had. Gerard Butler is incredible, Emily Rossum----- fabulous. What more can you want but a gorgeous cast with incredible voices! Buy the film you will absolutely love it!
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Yes, this is a ballet of destruction. When government is no longer by the people and only represents a fraction of the people then that government has lost its right to exist. A dictatorship by any other name is still a dictatorship. The logical consequence is revolution. Like they say, freedom isn't free. One idea this film implies is that the actively violent revolutionary is but the face, hands and voice of the silent majority. Perhaps this is also true in the middle east. <br />
0143036556|5.0|A fun read.  Entertaining.  A good look at some past societies, and how those cycles may repeat in the future.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is awesome. Although this album is from his younger days, the songs are memorable, creative and show off his talent with the guitar. It's hard to not get sentimental while listening to \\"St. Patrick's Day,\\" and \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" can't help but make you reflect on your own awkward situations. <br />No need to skip any songs on the album, although I definitely have my favorites. Two thumbs way up.

0790729342|5.0|The Road Warrior is one of my all time favorite movies without a doubt. And its story has been told many times in all the reviews below but what I think is sorely needed is some kind of a deluxe edition DVD. There appears to be few, if any, extras here. And its prequel mad Max has already gotten a special edition, why not its sequel? For instance, how about a commentary track from director George Miller? I know that getting Gibson to reminisce about this film is an unlikely proposition. And I'd love to see the original trailer for this film. If I recall it ended with a ghostly voice saying \\"...The Road Warrior..you better pray he's out there\\" On the technical side, how about some info on the famous car Gibson drove here?
075640407X|5.0|It seems to me that every year there are more books I want to read and less time for me to read them. Because my time is limited, I'm guilty of picking up the books by my favorite authors first, and fitting in new authors only when it's convenient.<br /><br />Due to a stroke of luck, I've had an advance copy of The Name of the Wind by my bedside for over six months, just waiting for me to open it.  Unfortunately, deadlines of my own kept getting in the way.  But in a way, it's lucky that I didn't crack this book until just a few days ago.  If I'd had this tale to distract me, I'd have been even later getting my  work done.<br /><br />I loathe spoilers, so I'm not going to discuss the plot of this book.  I will say it has all the things that I demand of a book. The characters are real, the action is convincing and it has a compelling story to tell.<br /><br />One of the things I like best about this book is that the magic is absolutely rooted in the book's world. Nothing seems contrived; the consistency is excellent.<br /><br />The characters are very well realized. That means that when the protagonist does something clever, it's believable.  And when he does something youthfully dumb, it rings just as authentically true. Because the characters are real and the magic is true to its own world, I closed this book feeling as if I'd been on a journey with an entertaining new friend, rather than sitting alone looking at words on a page.<br /><br />This one is well worth some of your precious reading time. I'll wager that the books to follow it will also be.<br /><br />Robin Hobb
B000A6T262|5.0|Every Star Trek fan needs this box set! It contains all 10 ST films in 2-disc Special Editions for about $8.00 a movie! You can't beat that!! I used to have these on VHS, but time has started to take it's toll on them; ST:The Motion Picture was unwatchable because of sound lines that prevented any audio! Well, ST:TMP may be one of the best of the set, which includes some new F/X shots as well as some trims to tighten the film.<br /><br />STII:The Wrath of Khan is also a Director's Edition with a couple of new scenes added (Did you know the engineer trainee that dies in Scotty's arms was his nephew in the film!?)<br /><br />OK, I'm not going to list the features on all 10 films are in this set, but just know that all contain audio commentaries (except INSURRECTION), all contain trivia text commentaries (including INSURRECTION) as well as some great behind the scenes stuff and deleted scenes. And all are in Widescreen, which is a bonus because all my VHS tapes were fullscreen; I'm seeing the entire picture on some of these movies for the very first time!<br /><br />Again, the Amazon price comes to about $8.00 per each 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. Every Star Trek fan needs this box set!

B000KQGP2G|4.0|It seems that many people are lost on what Pain of Salvation did on 'Scarsick\\", their latest release. An obvious reaction to the current events happening in our world, most notably on the Western side of it, namely America. <br />\\"Scarsick\\" plays off like the perfect insane joke, but with serious overtones. Most of the songs mimic American made styles (i.e Rap, Rap/Metal, Disco, Blues). It does well to accentuate the meaning of this album, what better way to speak out against the tragedies of our present state than through the very music that this country created! <br />Now don't get me wrong, I am in no way jumping on the \\"Bash-America for the sake of bashing something\\" bandwagon that many of my generation have found themselves, I am merely stating that \\"Scarsick\\" speaks of the current events, which it does. <br />The first half of the album mimics American Styles, while the second half seems to stray back to more traditional Pain of Salvation waters. Though, if you look at their music collection as a whole, they have done Rap/Metal since day one, the only real standout is the disco sounding song \\"Disco Queen\\", which really isn't disco at all, and sounds more like a Mr. Bungle rip off more than anything, though done really well, since Pain of Salvation are good artists. To be brutally honest with you, I still think that the vocalist of Pain of Salvation sounds A LOT like Mike Patton in many ways, as does the band as a whole. I don't really think that is mere coincidence (call me crazy, but I don't). Even Pain of Salvation cannot deny the greatness of Mike Patton...but I digress... <br /> <br />I think that the dark humor of \\"Scarsick\\" is lost by many of its fans. Maybe these fans think that Pain of Salvation have sold out to their political side a little too much and gone off the deep end, maybe they feel that Pain of Salvation have lost their creative spark. But I know different, Pain Of Salvation have always been political and have always stood up for humanity, but at the same time have also never failed to point out the darker sides. <br /> <br />While almost all of the songs on 'Scarsick\\" are amazing, \\"Spitfall\\", the Rap/metal tune on the album, gets annoying somewhat. The lyrical flow is weak, maybe as a statement that most rappers whole getup is weak(?). Or maybe Pain of Salvations vocalist isn't really that great of a rapper(?). THe chorus is really nice though, its message is deep. <br /> <br />No Pain of Salvation album is without its massive epic, which \\"Scarsick\\" has, in the form of \\"Enter Rain\\", a looong song, but has great moments.  <br /> <br />Overall, Pain of Salvation haven't changed at all, and their latest offering brings forth more musical prowess and artistic greatness.
0374105235|5.0|An amazing story by a young man who is able to put into words what his life was like as an early teen in Sierra Leone before he became a child soldier, including the ingeniuity of survival, and the horror and fear of war, as well as his love of family and life.
1582701709|5.0|No reason to judge, criticize or doubt.  This pleasant collection of interviews takes any open mind to a deep journey within our own personal thoughts of ourselves and our lives.<br /><br />Our minds have enormous power and not many institutions encourage us to discover and use that power: The Secret does!<br /><br />I highly recommend playing these CDs in the car, at home on a Sunday or during a long bath or massage.  With all the junk that gets into our heads, this one brings treasure!
B000ICL3KG|3.0|Al Gore makes a compelling case here for the fact of global warming. Perhaps the most telling part of his presentation revolves around the \\"before-and-after\\" pictures he shows. He juxtaposes slides of snow-covered Alpine Mountains some decades ago with current slides showing them bare butte naked. There are similar contrasts with then-and-now Mt. Kilamanjaro, the Antarctic glacier cover, and many others. <br /> <br />However Gore fails to present some information that might really galvanize viewers. Just after I saw this movie, I read an article that told how much carbon dioxide (the offending gas) is added to our atmosphere with each mile we drive, and with every hour he use some of the heavier duty utilities around our houses. It turns out that every auto commute, every airplane junket, adds more poundage of carbon dioxide to the air than is in the gas tanks of these conveyances. That's because the burnt carbon in the fuel combines with the oxygen in the atmosphere. The figures are astounding and Gore should have included them as a way of quantifying the damage done by casual energy use. <br /> <br />Also, I suspect that Gore's real presentations in front of audiences include question-and-answer periods. The producers should have kept some of these exchanges in the movie. So many people have cried wolf, there's a lot of cynicism to overcome. The Paul Ehrlich catastrophists of the 70s did a tremendous amount of damage by predicting global famine and death by the year 2000 - predictions which patently didn't come true. Back then, some scientists were in fact warning of the coming catastrophe of a global ice age. They also had figures and slides to back up these predictions. The depletion of the ozone layer was blamed.  <br /> <br />At the very end of An Inconvenient Truth, Gore makes glancing reference to that ozone layer problem. He says we solved that - and so with the same sort of determined will, we may be able to avert global warming. Well, I don't know that anyone can be so blithely sure that the ozone problem is solved. The fact that Gore dismisses that aspect of the problem and doesn't specifically recognize and address those not-so-bygone alternative scenarios hurts his credibility a little.  <br /> <br />As it is, Gore does a fairly good job of issuing a wake up call. It's just that I felt a little more rigorous, inclusive treatment might prevent a lot of people from pressing the snooze button, turning on their electric blankets, and going back to sleep. <br /> <br />
0143038419|5.0|There is nothing better than cozying up on the couch with a great book that you just can't put down and that not only makes you think, but truly delivers!  <br /> <br />From the introduction, I knew I would devour this memoir about the author's adventures revolving around different types of LOVE in three different and completely unique cultures: (1) in Italy for the love of food, words and coversations; (2) in India for the love of spirituality, and learning to love, forgive, and be herself;  and (3) in Indonesia for the love of balance, helping others and romantic love.  <br /> <br />The book is so beautifully written, I find myself thinking about various parts of it weeks after I have finished it. I also must have underlined a quarter of the book - her comments and thoughts were so memorable and inspiring. I HIGHLY recommend this book and think it would make a great gift for the women in your life of any age!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Having never seen any of the other Bond movies, I'm in no place to compare this one to those. And I like it that way.<br /><br />Casino Royale is an amazing action thriller. One where the main character just happens to be named James Bond. Daniel Craig's Bond is confident, intelligent, and beyond cool. But he's not invincible. He's a dedicated man who's survived because of his skill and adeptness at reacting quickly. He's a super-spy.<br /><br />The story flows quickly and with stunning cinematography, keeps the audience glued to the screen. This is the kind of movie where watching it in any form other than widescreen seems blasphemous. The director and cinematographer have put so much out there to look at, why would you want to miss any of it?<br /><br />The acting is top notch, and so is the story. The twists and turns may not be entirely unpredictable, but they're clever enough to keep the audience interested. The story falters a bit towards the end when it focuses on the love story and for a good ten minutes feels like some sort of romantic drama, but like any love affair, everyone eventually comes to their senses.<br /><br />Casino Royale is the kind of movie I would expect to see when thinking about the idea of James Bond. I've never been interested in Bond movies in the past because they seemed a bit too over the top and self aware. This film has really brought quality to the 21st century's James Bond, and I'm already looking for a sequel.<br /><br />The 2-disc special collection DVD is nice, but I wasn't that interested in any of the special features: becoming Bond, making of, trailers, etc. But if you're interested in that stuff, it's definitely there: a whole disc of it.<br /><br />Interesting piece of information: There's a 1967 version of Casino Royale starring Peter Sellers, but it's a spy-spoof movie, not a true Bond film.
B000CFLFX4|1.0|I was so excited to have a swivel sweeper. I watched the infomercial at least 100 times before I broke down and bought one at Smiths Marketplace. I charged the battery as directed. It only worked for maybe a minute the first time, and about 30 seconds every time there after. I called the customer service line, and they told me to take it back to the store. I did so, and charged the battery again, thinking I had a defective one. It only lasts for maybe 30 seconds if I am lucky. I guess I am lucky in that I only have it to vacuum my small bathroom floor, so 30 seconds is enough. It's sad, because when it does turn on and work, it works well.
B0000DC14V|4.0|I'm not a big fan of westerns, but this one is definitely worth the 2 hours and 20 minutes of dedication it takes to watch it. The story is constantly progressing and 45 years after it was made it's still an amazing and interesting story.<br /><br />Marlon Brando (directing and starring) really nailed this one. His Kid Rio is brilliantly calm, with a dark side brewing just under the surface. Five years after being left to be caught by the Mexican law by his bank robber sidekick Dad Longfellow, Rio sets out to find Longfellow and exact his revenge.<br /><br />What starts out as a revenge film turns into so much more as the characters are developed and the plot thickens. The scenery is beautiful: the kind of rolling desert hills and oceanfront shots you wish there were more of today. Also, Slim Pickens makes a great appearance as a deputy.<br /><br />The DVD quality isn't that great. As we get more and more used to HD quality images, older films like this one may be harder to watch, as suddenly everything in them seems hopelessly fuzzy, but that has more to do with current DVDs than with the original movie itself. Overall, it's a great watch and worth checking out.
B000JBWWQ0|1.0|This movie was so awful it was embarrassing. The book was entertaining, as I remember anyway, but the film was just excruciating. The acting was totally unconvincing and the plot was...... was there a plot? Can I think of anything good about it? I don't even think the scenery and cinematography were memorable. Don't even watch it on cable for free.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|I just love this movie.  I have seen it at least 10 times if not more and it is one that i just have not tired of.  It's a great blend of comedy and romance.  Meg Ryan and Kevin Klien make an interesting couple and the scattering of other French and Euro charters makes this a must have for my little library of romance movies.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This movie never gets old. Each and everytime I watch it, my heart is filled with so much joy, yet so much pain as well. This movie is so close to my heart, I can relate to the main characters. You never know who you fall in love with or when you fall in love, yet you can't have that person. I feel for them both, being in that same situation now in my life. It's funny how life deals you situations....you just never know. I truly believe there is that one \\"soul\\" person out there, for me, he's out there, I just can't have him all to myself. But I'm thankful I have him....no matter how small of a piece I have, I have my \\"soul\\" mate.
B00003CXP1|3.0|I'll say going in my expectations were at least somewhat high for this movie, which never helps. People have been name dropping it for years. All I knew was it was \\"depressing\\" and about \\"drugs\\" which is enough to figure out a lot right there. <br /> <br />It kicks off somewhere between two worlds... the intense and crude, drop out and score reality life of a young druggie son and his friend and girlfriend, and the the comic, barely believable life of his mother who's in lala land about television game shows. I really wished the two halves made more sense together, but I think they should have left the comedy side out. Some might say the mother's misadventures are a metaphor for the more subtle side of life, we need a fix from TV or food, or a fantasy, just like druggies need it from drugs, but overall this part of the film feels like it can't cover its bases with sincerity... it was a bridge too far to go and seriously hurt the ending for me. <br /> <br />The ending itself will be something you'll just go along with, or laugh at. That's up to you. Certainly an interesting film but it does not manage to represent a complex view of its subjects by the time it's over, to me anyway. <br />
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|This movies was very well done!  It keeps you in the thick of things but breaks away at just the right time when you think you can't take any more.  It is America at it's best.....people helping and caring for people!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer is a super talented guitar player.  It is rare that all songs are excellent in a CD, and this one really exceeded my expectations.  Even the CD cover shows the human and inspirational side of John Mayer, where at the end he encourages other musicians to get back to their instrument.  I've been playing this CD a lot, have not gotten tired of it at all.  My favorite song is Vultures.
B00003CXCW|4.0|This expozay of a decadent Hollywood would have packed a real punch in the 1950's. Compared to the excesses of our current breed of stars, however, Norma Desmond looks positively restrained.<br /><br />Still it has some nice comments to make about the movie business and features some entertaining performances - von Stroheim (a hoot) as the butler, De Mille as a great film director. and of course Gloria Swanson as the faded star.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|I would rate this 95% accurate (according to the <br />commentary) dramatization of the rescue of two PAPD <br />police officers with 5 stars.  This movie never bored <br />me and told a story that I personally was not familiar <br />with. <br /> <br />A number of people - probably none who will read this - <br />have said it is \\"too soon\\" or \\"too depressing\\" to tell <br />this story.  While I understand those emotions, on viewing <br />this film, I see it as a straightforward telling of real <br />life events against two popular themes in movies. <br /> <br />The first is the theme of the importance of family, love, <br />teamwork, duty, faith, comradely, and people helping other <br />people because it is the right thing to do.  This may sound <br />corny but I do not mean it to. <br /> <br />The second is the theme of battling to rescue fallen comrades <br />against real danger and time constraints.  This theme is <br />certainly one seen before in many war movies.  And in my mind, <br />this movie (along with \\"United 93\\") is a war movie, different <br />only in that we are not used to thinking of civilians on <br />the main land United Stated being targets of war. <br /> <br />Many other classic war films depict battles in which the human <br />toll exceeded that of 9/11.  (I am not trying to minimize 9/11, <br />but just to put this film in the context of other war films.) <br /> <br />That said, this film is emotionally intense (the commentary <br />tracks even more so), so people who feel they would be upset <br />by this probably should stay away. <br />
1582701709|5.0|I have believed in the teachings of \\"The Secret\\" all of my life, I just didn't know that it was centuries old.  <br /> <br />Some of the greatest minds that have ever lived practiced the principles of \\"The Secret\\".  <br /> <br />This book AND DVD, explain the rules of \\"The Secret\\" in very simple steps and make the concept easily understable.  <br /> <br />My life has been enhanced by reading and watching \\"The Secret\\".
0618551050|5.0|Lee Smolin's book operates at three levels:  <br />(1) an account of the history of the inter-twined history of relativity, quantum and string theory.  Smolin is clearly across all the interconnections and issues and the book is worth reading just for understanding that history <br />(2) his account of his personal journey through academia.  I think he has presented a very open account of where he stands. <br />(3) a critique of the way theoretical physics is currently done. This is the most incendiary level of the book but what makes it more so is that he peppers his observations about the sociology of science with his personal experiences. He really gives a no holds barred description of the state of the discipline. <br /> <br />Not being string theorist I am in no position to understand all the detail, but as a mathematician I was nothing short of astonished by his account of how the string community dealt with the issue of infinities. Very simply there is a problem with solutions blowing up but the consensus is that the problem has been solved.  Smolin not unreasonably seeks to find out who solved it and how ( I wondered at this point why he didn't know but it appears he was like many in the field who took it on faith because you can't personally validate every minute detail) and what he finds is not exactly edifying for those in the field. There is a partial solution that even its creator does not claim to be a complete solution.  This reinforces a constant theme in the book that the string community is not really interested in experimental tests of the theory and is quite happy to live with fantastic numbers of \\"landscapes\\" generated by the theory.  If you don't accept this you are apparently in some sort of denial. <br /> <br />Smolin comes pretty close to  accusing the community of pseudo science.  He does not actually do that but you can tell how strongly he feels about the state of science.  The strength of his critique is that he is balanced in his criticisms - he always brings it back to the evidence. <br /> <br />I came away from reading this book feeling pretty depressed that theoretical physics now looked as sleazy as my industry (finance).  I always knew that there were fads in science but it does seem that the string behemoth has gobbled everything else up but has done so in a largely unchallenged experimental context. <br /> <br />Where to from here?  I suspect that what will happen is that unless something dramatic happens you will see people exiting the field since observable reality must ultimately bite.  That may take a few more years. Where will they go?  I know the perfect place - finance.  They can work on hedge fund models and probably make lots of money too.  In a sense, given the picture Smolin paints of some of the denizens of the community they will fit in really well. In the world of finance reality is continually postponed until finally  you are standing in the rubble. <br /> <br />I will read Peter Woit's book \\"Not even wrong\\" as a comparison. <br /> <br />Would I like to see my smart daughter become a theoretical physicist?  I might let her make own decision by reading the book. <br />
B00005U2JL|4.0|I've known of MM for a long time: from his beginnings of always playing a local club in the early days in RI (Club BabyHead) and his shows at Ozzfest, yet I always thought he was a bit silly.  He always, to me, looked like a character out of The nightmare before Christmas. Plus, I thought it was bizarre how he hit the mainstream by the popularity of recording a Erthymics cover, since his music was distinct and was a milestone of later 90's hard rock. Much of his stuff, I didn't like until the Mechanical Animals stuff.  Yet, I always loved that song LONG HARD ROAD OUT OF HELL from the Spawm Movie.  In fact, I like alot of MM songs from Soundtracks: Sweet Tooth, Tained Love (remake), and the 1st scene into. song to Blair Witch 2: Disposable teens...So,I figured I'd add this DVD to my collection.  I did see this show at Ozzfest so knew what I was getting.  This dvd is well made, the sound is great and I have grown to respect this guy alot as a musician and his crazy-cool lyrics.  Funny, tough, I laughed hysetericly at this concert during his performance of THE NOBODIES and still laught watching it on dvd.  I just think it's whacked him on those old circus stilts.  Anyways, this is a great dvd, MM took Goth to the next level and certainly has impacted music and style--something not done since...Madonna... <br />I feel MM has grown as an artist and am actually looking forward to the release of his new cd EAT ME, DRINK ME in June 2007.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Neil Young is a music legend, and this concert DVD features Neil performing most of early hit songs at Massey Hall in Toronto Canada.  He sounds great vocally. After watching this DVD, I am convinced that he is also a talented and under rated guitar player too.  My favorite song is \\"Old Man.\\"  This song is about wanting to be loved and feeling alone.  \\"Down By The River\\" is a hit that Neil had as a member of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.  I love Neil's guitar playing on this song.  The  subject of the song is about how a man feels after he shoots the one he loves.  The subject matter is weird to me, but Neil sounds great performing this tune. \\"Helpless\\" is another classic song.  This tune is about how much Neil loves his home in Ontario Canada.  \\"Heart Of Gold\\" is another excellent tune.  I love Neil's harmonica playing here  I also liked the song \\"The Needle and The Damage Done\\"  This song is about the allure and danger of drugs, and the effects they can have on a person.  \\"Ohio\\" is Neil's anti war song  This song is  his tribute to the four students who died at Kent State in 1970.  This song is very moving and one of my favorites.  I really enjoyed watching this DVD and listening to the music here.  If you are a fan of Neil Young, this CD and DVD combo is a must for your collection.
B00005JL0I|4.0|This is one of those strange movies that is great fun to watch.  The cast is about as fabulous as you could ask for, and you get David Niven as the original James Bond (ah if he only would have been instead of Connery).  The movie is a comedy spoof and works as that, although the jokes can be bad (pay attention for 'hairloom'). <br /> <br />All-in-all, it's good fun and has a great soundtrack.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Since I bought this CD my husband and I have been listening to it daily. <br />It is absolutely fabulous.  I cannot and will not ever get tired of listening to it.  I agree with B.B.King's feelings and am so grateful that KWS and collaborators took the time to do this project with some of the best Blues players to have walked this earth.  Although the Blues has been acknowledged more in recent years, I am hoping this endeavor will bring it to the forefront of the music industry and finally receive the recognition it deserves !
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|Probably the best concert ever! As I am only 31 years old, this was my first real Streisand experience and since I heard this album I was in love with her voice forever. I have the album on vinyl, cd, minidisc and the concert on Laserdisc and DVD now...The best!!<br /><br />(The concert in LA was also great!!)
B000002H6C|5.0|AWESOME METAL CD! Necessary addition to any metal collection! ONE OF THE BEST METAL CDS EVER!
B00005JLWN|5.0|Never even heard of this in 2002 when this was released, and 2002 was a great year itself for sci-fi. We had Star Wars Ep2, Solaris and my favourite sci-fi film up to that point ... Minority Report. Then only a couple of weeks ago, went down to my local HMV store and saw this on the shelves on sale.    My expectations wasnt very high, but I am a big fan of C. Bale and to me, he was always engaging. After putting this on, and 107 minutes later, I was hooked. Not the way I was utterly impressed like Minority Report when I first watched it, but somehow, it certainly had me thinking of the movie's theme, the gunkata fight sequences, which were so awesomely jaw-dropping it outdid anything Matrix ever had at a fraction of its budget.    Then I watched it again with the commentary, and I caught all the details I missed out the first time. Then it hit me, this was a great film. No, make it a supreme film. 2nd time around, I noticed the cinemtography and the production design, which were in a word, beautiful. And the story, which whilst not original, is definitely very engaging. 1984, Fahrenheit 451 are movies that come to mind, but they were never this entertanining.     Make this the 1984 for this millennium, a movie that moves with the ultra slick pace of a Matrix, but with a more deep rooted theme of dystopia and control that is worlds apart from the philosophies and twists of the Walchowski bros. In a way, it is a simple story, but simple stories told well and acted well can also be profound and long lasting.    And the acting, I believe Bale's role is his best. It's not easy to notice at first as he plays a cold, ruthless cleric and despatches the resistance with hardly a blink. But his physical abilities and fluid movements shows off Bale's capabilities as an action hero that can give Keanu's Neo a run for his money. But what augments this immeasurably is his ability to act ... and to slowly emote over the length of the film.    Catch the scene where he awakes to a sunrise and for the first time, is able to feel and appreciate it even for this simple act. And Emily Watson's short but very effective role as the woman who first instigate him to think about turning. Their scenes are not the easiest, yet the tension and eventual connection they make through just looks and the slightest of dialogue. Sean Bean is always equally memorable in his very brief role as Bale's partner.    Round it up with good performances by Taye Diggs and Angus McFadden and this movie surpasses the usual sci-fi stilted acting that we are so often bombarded with. Kurt Wimmer, the director is also a smart director. Instead of giving us cliches, he gives us situations which you might not necessarily expect, short but stunning fight sequences instead of prolonged fights and explosions/stunts which only hampers the story and pace.    Ultimately, it's a movie that rewards with subsequent viewings, and may explain why this has turned into such a cult classic among its devoted followers, myself included. Fan fiction and fan videos have already extended the world of Libria and pay homage to the movie and its characters. While it may never reach the dizzying heights of Matrix, it doesnt need to.     This film is not for the masses, but for those who can really appreciate its intentions and its strong visuals (despite its lack of budget) and eventually, the theme behind it. As Kurt himself says, its more about numbness towards everything and how one man reacts to it and finds himself liberated by the simplest of things that we take for granted.    For myself, I will enjoy rewatching this as only the best in sci-fi movies can compel me to do so. It is simply not just a sci-fi cult classic, it is a geniune masterpiece in a genre that rarely produces one.
B00001IVOF|5.0|A year and a half after the release of the classic The Infamous Mobb Deep came out with another critically acclaimed follow up, Hell On Earth.  While covering no new ground with their lyrics or topics its still a superb album that gave fans more of the same, which is what they wanted.  Lyrically this album is probably a notch under The Infamous and because it came after it is rarely talked about in the same breath, although it is very nearly as good as its predecessor.  Where they did step up was with Havoc's production, while the beats follow a similar eerie, haunting type of vibe they are not as sparse as those on The Infamous and are more Cinematic, particularly on the classic G.O.D Pt 3 which superbly samples the Scarface theme tune.<br /><br />There are several other great tracks and guest appearances, Method Man is fire on Extortion, the title track is great, Still Shinin, Man Down, Apostle's Warning and pretty much every other track on here.  Also a quick mention to Drop A Gem On Em, they were the only people to really diss Tupac back after his multiple disses at the end of Hit Em Up (and other tracks).  Now while I am a Tupac fan i can fully understand why they chose to hit back at him as the situation was getting completely out of hand, im only surprised others didnt also, it is a good track anyway.  A very near classic album that is surpassed in their catalogue only by The Infamous, pick up both of them to hear the definitive Mobb Deep.
B000059R8Y|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable CD. From the opening smooth samba of \\"Reptile\\", to the rockin' \\"Superman Inside\\", this CD is full of fresh sounding covers and originals, with excellent playing and production. My favorites are: \\"Reptile\\" (Eric Clapton), \\"Got You On My Mind\\" (Joe Thomas and Howard Biggs), \\"Travelin' Light\\" (JJ Cale), \\"Come Back Baby\\" (Walter Davis), \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand For It\\" (Stevie Wonder), \\"Second Nature\\" (Eric Clapton), \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\\" (James Taylor), and \\"Superman Inside\\" (Eric Clapton, Doyle Bramhall II).   It's a good CD to listen to when taking a road trip, or relaxing on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.

B000LC55F2|5.0|This was, hands down, one of the best films I have ever seen. That being said, it required two viewings in order for me to realize that.<br /><br />The Prestige is so intricately crafted that first time round I missed a lot of the plot--especially towards the beginning. (As I did with Nolan's other remarkable film, Memento.) I was completely caught up in the mood of the film, a subtle mixture of repressed emotion and obsession, and in the acting, which was just marvellous. (Although Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale played their parts masterfully, it was Michael Caine who stole the show.)<br /><br />What I liked best about this film was its refusal to fall into cliche--the classic \\"good guy vs. bad guy.\\" While you can sympathize with them, neither of the main characters is particularly likeable. Their motives are, in fact, reprehensible. Yet I never felt as though I didn't believe in them. Obsession, as Michael Caine points out, is a young man's game. And these two young men played out their obsessions to the climax, which while inevitable, is twisted enough to take viewers by surprise. (I confess, I didn't see it coming.)<br /><br />Days after seeing the film I am still thinking about it. One could probably write a book about the symbolism--the caged birds, the multiple hats (Jackman and Bale \\"wore\\" several), the intricate interweaving between the magic of science, and the trickery of magic. The film successfully conveyed the  complex metaphors of Christopher Priest's book without losing any of its entertainment value.<br /><br />The Prestige is tight, well acted, beautifully filmed, carefully thought out, intelligent, and captivating. What more could one ask? An Academy Award, perhaps.
0783231202|5.0|I borrowed a copy of this film from the public library after a replica of Amistad stopped in Wilmington, DE.  Those of us who toured the ship saw the shackles that held the people and learned how they worked.  We saw the area in which the people were held.  A gentleman from Sierra Leone who claimed to be a descendant of \\"Cinque\\" explained some of the history of the slave trade and of the Amistad people.  In all, the tour was chilling because I suppose I had never been brought so close to the experiences of those men and women who were brought to this country as slaves.  I wanted to see the film and learn more.<br /><br />Of course the film is fictionalized, and maybe one has to see the ship \\"in real life\\" to better appreciate the film.  Still, since I saw it, and since I saw the ship replica, I've tried to find out more about this history, both on the internet and in the library.  I've also thought about the fact that some issues raised in the film are still relevant today.  The issue of the independent judiciary is one.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg does have an optimistic take on the story here, as he does in most of his films.  Sometimes, life doesn't bring happy endings.  Still, I liked the film because it was a great story, told carefully, acted well, and photographed beautifully, and it started me thinking and learning.  Few films these days do that.
0780622553|2.0|Any movie that starts with a man waking up in a bathtub minus a memory, but plus a mutilated body is bound to catch your attention. Especially if that man is dark, mysterious Rufus Sewell (Murdoch) and the body has interesting designs carved into it.<br /><br />From that point on, or shortly thereafter, the movie goes downhill. Visually it is sumptuous, with its moody,1940s film noirish landscape. Both Sewell and John Hurt (the mandatory hardboiled detective) do a good job with their parts, but there is relatively little in the way of coherence to hold this film together.<br /><br />Supposedly, the aliens who induce massive memory loss, followed by memory exchange, are doing this because they are dying out. With their spectacular powers, it is hard to believe that they have to go running around a city every night to individually set people up to be murderers, or wealthy, or anything else they can come up with.  If they can stop time every night with their \\"tuning\\", make buildings grow, and maintain all of this in outer space somewhere, why can't they just accomplish their goal with their minds? In any event, all the running around doesn't seem to have much to do with the aliens' quest for individuality (which doesn't seem to have much to do with their demise). And given their amazing powers, why can't they protect themselves from Murdoch? Why does Murdoch have these powers too? And why doesn't he use them consistently after he discovers that he has them? One minute he's creating a door where there wasn't one, and the next he's fleeing someone with a knife.<br /><br />If not for the acting of the two protagonists, and a lot of pretty visuals, this movie would be too lame to stand on its own. But if you don't think too much, you can have a good time.
0743289412|3.0|7.5 STARS OUT OF 10!!!<br /><br />Lisey's Story begins with a widow looking to finally deal with her past husband's belongings.  Her husband just happens to be a multi millionaire writer by the name of Scott Landon.  As she goes about her business of moving and disposing of her husband's belongings, she starts to have flashbacks of their marraige spanning 20 years.  The more she remininces, the more she realizes that her husband had a bit of a secret life that she was not privy to.  Throw in a crazed stalker, a depressed sister, some obnoxious made up language, a secret world, and you have Lisey's Story.<br /><br />This book starts off SLOW.  I mean real slow.  Slow to the point of taking the book and beating yourself to death with it.  During this time you get to know Lisey, her family, and also an ample supply of flashbacks concerning her late husband.  They seem scattered and almost meaningless, but around the halfway point of the book, it all seems to make sense.  There are a few chilling scenes which rival the creepiness of anything that King has ever done.  And that's saying something.<br /><br />As quick as the story picked up, it slowed back down though.  The last 150 pages were long, boring, and predictable.  Not predictable as in a keen reader MAY guess the ending.  Predictable as in Forrest Gump WILL know the ending before it gets there.<br /><br />With that said, Lisey was overall a pretty AVERAGE book.  There was the potential of a GREAT book during a 60 page stretch about halfway through, but when it was all said and done, the final product was just so-so.
B00005JPO8|5.0|There are 2 movies that in my mind are without a doubt the best films of 2006: \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" and \\"The Lives of Others\\". By far not the popular choices in their categories, those being \\"The Departed\\" and \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", but also by far the best stories, and the better told ones as well. <br /> <br />I will not describe the movie plot, other reviewers have done a fair job of it already. What I will restate is that without a doubt Ulrich Mühe steals the show. His acting is precise and believable to the point that it's obvious there is a devotion to his character that borders on the personal. An amazing performance. One wonders if he himself is not truly a reformed Stasi now acting for a living. <br /> <br />The film itself is less a tale of East Germany, or of oppression. You would believe that if you didn't see past the surface of the story. It's more a story about the human condition, about goodness, about the fact that good people exist, and people can change to become one. In this way, the film is filled with foreshadowing script... We first hear how \\"people don't change\\", but the artist, the writer (Sebastian Koch) is a believer of the opposite, and so his plays show this (and therefore the movie does as well). We also hear how if you are able to experience the beauty of music and indeed feel it for yourself, you must be in essence a good person... and thus the inevitable transformation of the protagonist ensues. <br /> <br />This story, in spite of being drama, is about hope, about love, about goodness and about life... and how in the presence of all of this the good in people prevails no matter what their prejudice may have been. <br /> <br />With regards to another reviewer's comment about Pan's Labyrinth deserving the Oscar over this film. I must disagree. This film relied solely on the strength of the story, its characters and its acting. Where the story told by Pan's Labyrinth relies at times on cliche, and is heavy on needing visuals to enticeyou further, I believe you could read the script for the \\"Lives of Others\\" and still be mesmerized, only to then be further blown away by the acting in the movie. Superb.
0618680004|5.0|I have been an Athiest for most of my adult life, and have suffered many set backs because of it, always at the hand of christianity. The funny thing is that I have always believed that everyone has the right to believe in whatever they CHOOSE to believe in. The emphasis is on the word CHOOSE. This book bravely brings light, and questions the mass indoctrination of our younger generation, into the three main abrahamic faiths. Some will find this confronting, some will be disturbed, some will be motivated to seek the possibility of change. <br /> <br />It was refreshing to read such an indepth and easy to read account of the continuing argument over just what god is about (be it christianity, islam or jewdaism). This book will be feared by the 'believers', provide comfort for Athiests and hopefully open the minds of those that question the faith they were brought up with. <br /> <br />This book highlights the difference between looking up into the night sky in awe at just how amazing our predicament here on earth really is, rather than arrogantly dismissing it as just another one of gods creations. It will open your mind at just how amazing Darwins theory of evolution is. It deals and challenges some of the myths that religion has spawned toward key people like Hitler, Stalin and mainly Darwin. <br /> <br />First class reading for the Athiest, highly recommended for believers.

Even on the most beautiful days of the whole year - the days when summer is changing into fall - the crickets spread the rumor of sadness and change.\\"<br /><br />There are powerful messages that every child longs to hear: life is special and worth cherishing at all costs - and against all odds.  That is the backdrop for this tale.  I read this book in the third grade and I'm now reading it aloud to my children at bedtime.<br /><br />On my daughter's level, the animals talk.  Great fun.  And on my sons' level, we struggle to survive and have to plan for the future (but how?).  Oh yeah, spiders are cool too.<br /><br />So much of E.B.White's prose is visceral - looking across a pasture at dusk: the smell of horses, the slanted rays of the sun illuminating small vortices of insects, the nearby sounds of crops shaking in the breeze, the pink hues of the sky.  This is the world of Charlotte's Web. Against this pastoral beauty, the main themes of this book center on mortality and friendship.  Life is tragically ephemeral whether this is the life of a runt pig, or the fate of the same spring pig.<br /><br />My children marvel that in a great hour of need, desperately alone, a heroine comes in the most unlikely of forms.  We learn that perhaps the greatest obstacle to salvation isn't the effort of a savior, but rather the  assent of a trusting soul - \\"But Charlotte,\\" said Wilbur, \\"I'm not terrific.\\"<br /><br />Little minds (and big ones too) can wrestle with big ideas when reading this book.  Just what is our purpose while we are in this \\"barnyard\\"?  Is it to play the role of the rescuer or rescued.  Or do we standby like the sheep and geese, and even self absorbed rats can be deliverers sometimes too.<br /><br />\\"It's not often that someone comes along who is a true friend . . .\\" maybe the most applicable truth in this tale. As I read this book at night, I look at my children, who are growing up before my very eyes.  I hope we learn from this book to be rescuers, to have the humility to be rescued, and to treasure our true friends.  I turn off the lights and in the distance I hear the crickets, warning me that summertime cannot last forever.<br /><br />DON'T EVEN THINK OF DEPRIVING YOUR CHILDREN OF THIS BOOK.we learn from this book to be rescuers, to have the humility to be rescued, and to treasure our true friends.

B000002UB6|5.0|Let It Be has taken a lot of criticism over the years, but it's my personal favorite of all The Beatles' albums. The rooftop concert is priceless (it was the band's only live performance after the 1966 concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park). In fact, the rest of the album was recorded live, too (in the studio). It all starts with a short announcement by John Lennon:<br /><br />\\"I dig a pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Def-Aids. Phase one in which Doris gets her oats.\\"<br /><br />Two of Us is a song Paul McCartney wrote about himself and his wife, Linda. He and John harmonize like old friends, and it's a simple and warm beginning.<br /><br />John rocks I Dig a Pony with an inspired vocal performance, then picks up his acoustic guitar for the surreal and contented Across the Universe.<br /><br />George Harrison gets his turn with I Me Mine, his comment on selfishness in the world. The song starts slow with a blues guitar lick played over a church organ, and has a raucious chorus with George and Paul screaming, \\"I, me, me, mine\\". Then John goes into Dig It, a short interlude that goes nowhere, really.<br /><br />Paul then launches into Let it Be, the inspirational gospel-tinged title track. It's a great song, and Paul's vocal performance is perfect. Then  the group breaks into a short ditty about a Liverpool streetwalker, Maggie Mae.<br /><br />It's up on the roof for I've Got a Feeling. With Paul and John trading the lead vocal, it's a Beatles song unlike any other, and it rocks, too.<br /><br />Still on the roof top, they  break into One After 909, a Lennon-McCartney song written when they were teenagers, still wearing black leather jackets in the 1950's. John and Paul sing like they're having the time of their lives! With it's old time rock n' roll phrases and piano rolls, the song is a blast.<br /><br />Back in the studio, Paul is on the piano for The Long and Winding Road, the last single ever released by The Beatles as an active group (it was also their last #1). Paul was furious when Phil Spector added a harp and female voices to the song, but the schmaltzy production turned a good song into an epic one; it's one of the world's most loved songs.<br /><br />The wild and windy night<br />That the rain washed away<br />Has left a pool of tears<br />Crying for the day<br /><br />George plays For You Blue, a nice acoustic blues (\\"Elmore James is got nothing on this baby\\") with John playing bottleneck slide guitar (\\"Go, Johnny, go!\\").<br /><br />Then it's back up on the roof for the closer, Get Back, a driving rocker sung by Paul (John later said Paul was looking at Yoko every time he sang the words, \\"Get Back!\\"). John plays the lead guitar lines between Paul's vocal phrases. It's one of The Beatles' best, and a perfect end to this very special album.<br /><br />Let It Be wasn't an easy album to make for The Beatles, but it's an album that has some of their greatest songs. The live aspect of the project and Phil Spector's production make the album special and unique.

1416914285|1.0|The book has a number of problems.  These problems all add up to make a book that is not worth buying.    The main character is a Mary Sue.  The more obvious clues include her name, and where she lives.  If you were to read this book and run Clary through a Mary Sue Litmus Test, she would score a raging Mary Sue.  The Mary Sue Litmus Test would advise you to do a serious rewrite.  Most people don't enjoy reading Mary Sues. [...]    The book does too much telling, very little showing.  This happens frequently.  The phone is across the room.  You don't need to tell me that.  How about \\"Clary ran across the living room and picked up the retro-red phone which sat on a table.\\"  That is better than, paraphrasing here, \\"The phone was retro-red.  It sat on an antique table in the hallway, which connected to the living room.  Clary ran to answer it.\\"  There are numerous scenes which do that.  Many of them are much lengthier than that example.     The point of view frequently shifts and in doing so, characters will repeat what other characters have said.  It makes things repetitious.  Clary describes something.  Shift in point-of-view, sometimes mid-scene, Simon describes something that Clary has just described.  When this happens, it doesn't add to the plot, nor the understanding of the characters.    [...]    The plot is highly derivative.  It rips from Harry Potter (Why hello there Draco, I mean Jace.  Hello there Harry Potter, I mean Simon).  It rips from Buffy. (Why hello there Spike, I mean Jace.) It rips from Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunters.  (And she sent Cassandra Claire, her agent and publisher a cease and desist note on the use of the word Dark-Hunters.)  You can read parts of the work and wow, [...]  It whole sale rips from Star Wars.  The plot involving parents, siblings, the reveal of relationships, the battle against evil, just lock stock and barrel Star Wars.  The foreshadowing is so heavy that you know this plot is coming by the second chapter.  And the bookdelivers on it, as promised.  This plot could be written in an original manner, adding new insight into the genre, into that plot.  Plenty of fantasy authors and science fiction authors do that.  Cassandra Claire?  Not so much.     [...]  The passages are randomly inserted into the text, clearly designed to trick the reader into assuming that the passages are original to the book.  They aren't changed substantially to give new insight into the characters, the scene, the authors mind.  They add nothing to the book.  But maybe this is really a game the author is playing with her fandom audience: Spot the quotes from her fan fiction.    Descriptions are problematic. You can read this whole book and not really know what Clary looks like.  Her hair color is never really described.  The length of her hair is only described compared to her mother's hair.  The length of her mother's hair is not described accurately. It is only described as long.  Clary's eye color is not described.  There are other things which would help in developing a visual which the author fails to describe.  As such, the reader is left with an unclear view of what is happening.  Some one else said that it is likely the author had a picture of Clary in her mind and thought the reader did too. The writing reflects that.     The problems discussed above are why people should give City of Bones, Mortal Instruments a pass.  Don't buy it.
B000002P5R|5.0|After guitar god Jimi Hendrix died, he released more albums than he did when he was still alive. Control of Jimi's music fell into the hands of attorneys who saw the opportunity to turn a fast buck, and quickly released this excellent music chopped up into several different albums (Rainbow Bridge, Cry of Love, War Heroes, etc.,etc.). After much litigation and several years, control of Jimi's music was given to Jimi's father and sister. They formed the Experience Hendrix record label and went to work. The first task at hand was to put together First Rays of the New Rising Sun, Jimi's title to the double-album he was putting the finishing touches on when he died. Through interviews with the producer, engineers, and musicians who worked on the project, they finished the album according to Jimi's specifications. The music on the album is sophisticated, energetic, and precise. Hendrix fans will recognize most of these songs. Freedom, Angel, Dolly Dagger, Roomful of Mirrors, Isabella, Hey Baby(New Rising Sun), and the beautiful Drifting are all highlights. Like The Beatles leaving behind the cute mop-top Beatlemania era with Rubber Soul and Revolver, Jimi seemed to be breaking away from the psycadelic wild-man theatrics of his early days, and getting down to the business of creating serious music with a conscience. You will find some of Jimi's best songs, vocals, and guitar playing on the aptly titled First Rays of the New Rising Sun. No Jimi Hendrix fan should be without it.

B000N4SHPS|4.0|Sylvester Stallone is back for the 6th time as Rocky Balboa. Yes he's old which had many people including myself making fun of the fact that he was doing another. Yet Stallone manages to pull it off anyway. It's about him trying to prove that he's a somebody yet again. Since spectators try to say he was over-rated and that a famous boxer of today would destroy him. A computer fight shows that Rocky would win but not many people actually agree with it. The movie isn't all about the fight though. It's about Rocky trying to move on after the death of his beloved wife Adrian and trying to get back into the life of his son. It's also about as smart as the first one.<br /><br />  I always have found myself thinking about the girl he gave advice about not smoking in part 1. She's even back in this one and Rocky is looking out for her once again. The movie could've easily have given us a romance between the two but Stallone's script is smart enough to know that Rocky could probably never get with another woman after Adrian. So they just have a little innocent flirtation thing going on.<br /><br />  The movie is good but I don't think there's even any mention of the fact that he had a serious concussion after his fight in part 4. Which is why he was even retired in the first place since another fight would've risked brain damage. But who cares really since it's nice to see Stallone and Burt Young on screen together one last time anyway. The film wasn't needed that much but still it's a respectful reunion with Stallone giving his best performance in awhile. Rocky doesn't only make a great comeback but so does Stallone since before this he has been making made for dvd movies for a few years now. I think he's going a little too far by making a Rambo 4 though...lol. But who knows, if he could pull off a good Rocky film at his age then maybe he can even pull off a Rambo 4.
006112429X|3.0|Every so often the world of literature throws up a novel like this - one that in no accounts can be called great literature, yet is gripping and compelling in a way that pure commercial drivel cannot match. Books like 'The Secret History' by Donna Tartt and 'The Beach' by Alex Garland fall into this category. They are great bad books, and they are usually one hit wonders by authors who accomplish little else of note in their writing lives.<br /><br />'We Need to Talk About Kevin' is one such book. Don't get me wrong, I am not being derogatory. The novel is one of the most remarkable and memorable I have read in recent years. Shriver is obviously a writer of formidable intellect, and the range of themes her panoramic mind alights upon over the sweep of this brutal novel is immense. In a single book she covers the following: the plight of the intelligent, attractive woman who is worried about the affects of childbirth on the quality of her life and physical appearance: 'What possessed us? We were so happy! Why, then, did we take the stake of all we had and place it all on this outrageous gamble of having a child?''; the paradoxical attraction of strong minded, intelligent women to simple, wholesome men; the dynamics of contemporary US commercialism, high school culture, family rituals and politics, and how they intertwine in child rearing; the mindset of the cold blooded sociopathic child; the struggles to maintain a career after starting a family; the tensions inherent in developing marriages, especially those that produce difficult children; inter sibling bullying; the difficulty in resigning yourself to a culture and lifestyle you increasingly despise; the struggles of coping with a sociopathic child after he has committed a high school murder atrocity. The list is remarkable. Shriver, I salute you for having the courage to take on all these themes in such a remarkably bold manner, and tie them all up in a plot that enrages as much as it enthralls. The pages keep turning right to the chilling denoument, even though it is hinted at from the start.<br /><br />That deals with the great part. Why then, is 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' such a bad book? Starting with the question of style, the novel suffers like many page turning novels in that the powerful, thrilling plot takes readers' minds off the stylistic wonders on the page. As Milan Kundera says, a strong plot acts like a drag on the style, for the reader is too eager to get to the next page to fully appreciate the subtle glories of each sentence. That said, Shriver is no natural stylist. Her voice is powerful for the themes she incorporates, not for the quality of the writing. Metaphors are strained or clanging, or cliched. The prose neither sparkles like, say, Nabokov in 'Lolita', nor is limpid enough like, say, Bret Easton Ellis in 'American Psycho' to act as a stylistically transparent curtain to the gruesome story beneath.<br /><br />The whole conceit is bizzarre. Shriver's Kevin is not a black wearing sociopath with a fetish for Nazi ephemera living in a trailer with alcoholic parents as is the prototype for American high school killers. He is a formidably intelligent, cold blooded child, who gives nothing away from the start and builds evil act upon evil act until the inevitable conclusion is reached. Some of the scenes are powerfully realistic, such as when Kevin squirts his mothers proud wall display of maps with an ink gun, others are bizzare - like when Eva comments on his staccato prose style as that of a potential killer (as if she is shoehorning her research into the prose styles of serial killers into the book). Obviously (thank goodness!) such a book is not written from Shriver's own experience, so it is perhaps inevitable that her bold imaginative efforts sometimes fall a little short of complete plausibility.<br /><br />The whole artifice is one that tells a semi-plausible story of how a child killer might develop, yet hits too many wrong notes to really convince. Then there is the denoument, which I won't give away, but let me say that it is as ludicrous as it is compelling as it is over the top as it is addictively horrifying. A fitting conclusion to such a novel.<br /><br />Another fascinating theme of this novel (which packs in so many) is the strident feminist political polemic which begins as a low whine and builds towards a screaming siren towards the end of the book. These twin themes are dualised by the characters of Eva and Franklin, Kevin's parents. The whole novel is epistolary. Eva writes to her husband, who never replies, trying to make sense of what has happened. Franklin turns out to be one of the most absurdly pathetic and stupid characters in all of fiction. A Republican who can only see good in his country and his kids, even when it is palbable that his All American, Bruce Springsteen idyll has long been ripped apart, he comes across by the end of the novel as a patsy who deserves everything he gets. Eva, on the other hand, hits all the right pc buttons. A Democrat, an Armenian (hence has ethnic outsider status), an intelligent woman who juggles family and career and is ever so hip and cynical even right up to and after the fateful day when her life is blown apart. Eva, in complete contrast to Franklin, comes across as a tragic heroine for our times.<br /><br />This is no great work of art, identify with the author not the characters type novel. Shriver clearly contrived the book in such a way that empathy with the characters is everything, to the point where we are supposed to be fuming at the state of the homely, simple minded, right wing male and glorify the tragic plight of the mother who has the foresight to see tragedy coming, goes through hell, and, following Winston Churchill's motto, keeps going. Shriver does a great piece of cheerleading for her views on modern masculinity, women, and socio-political domestic life, but is it great literature? I think Shriver has necessarily absconded that claim in order to write such a powerful polemic.<br /><br />That, in a nutshell, is why I think 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' is a great bad book. But do read it. It takes courage, but you won't fail to be riveted.to really convince.

B000NA28I4|3.0|I never got through the whole book of Eragon yet but from what I read it would seem the film is a little too fast paced. It skips a lot of character development to put the dragon in the hands of Eragon right in the very beginning of the movie. Heck it even has the dragon grow quickly and goes straight to Eragon training to be a dragon rider pretty quick. It's faithful to the book but with cutting out a lot of talking to mostly just have action. The best thing about the movie is the relationship between Eragon and the dragon. It's well done how they communicate by their minds and is faithful to the book. Jeromy Irons isn't bad either and is prety brave I must say. I mean he had the guts to do another dragon movie after Dungeons and Dragons...lol.<br /><br />  The direction is  kind of sloppy though since everything is just quickly thrown together with no real scenes of wonder. I don't think it's fair that it got bad reviews because everyone compares every fantasy that comes out to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Not every fantasy that comes out is gonna be that good. This is still a decent fantasy with nice looking effects and cool villians. But I'd be dishonest if I didn't admit that it was kind of a mess since it's too fast paced with everything thrown together kind of sloppy. The end makes it clear that there could be more but it's kind of cheesey and doesn't even make that much sense. Plus since this one wasn't that well received we might not even get a sequel that continues after the silly ending that shows that things won't remain happlily ever after. This is a bit of a spoiler but if the king had a dragon then why didn't he use it against Eragon and his in the first place ??

0307237699|5.0|Barack Obama writes with clarity, wisdom, and facility. He has a unique ability to describe the way our political life functions.  I work in my local political organization and found that Obama helped me articulate many issues which I was struggling with. For example, his description of the subtle impact of spending so much time having to raise large amounts of money in order to be elected. And he sees the middle ground between the important statements of  issues without compromising the clarity of his own vision.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is ready to move beyond cynicism and try to get a handle on how we need to reform our broken political process.

B000062XGF|5.0|Stealing the Rembrandt was just for practice. Ginny Barker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who worked for Waverly Security had a much larger goal in mind robbing the International Clearance Bank during the Millenium Celebratrion on New Year's Eve in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia but she needed help. She had been planning this event for a few years ... Hector Cruz (Will Patton) head of security had noticed she had no friends. She had no social life. She worked long hours doing statistical calculations and creating computer graphics examining all angles of the rooms and items her company insured and protected. He worried about her. She convinced Hector to let her attempt to catch and bring to justice the highly successful thief: McDougall (Sean Connery). He was a handsome foxy older gentleman, a wealthy Scotsman who had no need for the money but was a thief for the challenge of it. He was in the gallery where the Rembrandt was showcased during its opening exhibit, he was the likliest suspect. Hector was worried because two agents had previously disappeared trying to apprehend McDougall but Gin Barker convinced him because she was a woman ... she could do it. Despite misgivings, he gave her the chance to try.<br /><br />Sean Connery played the aging gray haired foxy thief to perfection. He lived in Scotland, in a castle on an isolated island. He thought he had everything ... until he met Gin Barker. She followed him about in London, and watched him wander into a computer company, where he managed to steal five chips easily worth a million dollars each. She was exhausted as she returned to her hotel room, only to discover her luggage missing. She was too tired to report it immediately, pealed off her clothes and and prepared for bed ... totally naked because her dressing gown was among the missing items. She was shocked to discover someone staring at her in the dark. It was Mac (McDougall). He asked why was she following him around London. She then presented to him her grandiose plans. He mentioned his rules: \\"first we try, then we trust\\" and the corollary, \\"it's strictly business\\" ...<br /><br />First he tested her and when she passed all his challenges, beyond his wildest expectations, he took her up on the job. They trained for the highest value monetary robbery of all time. This film appeals on multiple levels: it includes mystery, romance, tension, unexpected twists and turns in the plot and exotic locales, London, Scotland and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The May - December romance and relationship which builds from total distrust, to mutual respect, to outright admiration is fun to watch. Catherine Zeta-Jones is believable, beautiful and in fantastic form as she executes gymnastic maneuvers that would make a Gold Medal Female Olympics Champion blush with pride. Sean Connery delivers a superb performance and also delivers outstanding one line responses to her confident approach. He says, \\"I don't like surprises.\\" She replies, \\"There won't be any.\\" He countermands, \\"Trust me, there always are.\\" This is a highly enjoyable film and receives my highest recommendation for acting, story-line, plot development, action, and intrigue.

B00003CWTI|5.0|If you like subtly and nuance in your films, I'm afraid this one isn't for you.    Some of the characters and the dialog they speak are so over the top that I'd easily dismiss it,  except for some odd reason, it was pretty compelling.  Magnolia is three hours long, and yet the film always seems to be at a pivotal moment and never drags.  So many things seem to be happening at once and watching it is very intense.    It only stands to reason that such an ambitious movie production would of course take on ambitious subjects of the human condition.  It opens showing a series of humorous events, supposedly true, about strange coincidences and unexpected connections between people.  The whole movie expands on this theme, with a  large ensemble of characters are unexpectedly linked in various ways.    As we follow the characters on one particular day, we explore how hate and insensitivity cultivates itself, what it means to be in love, what it means to be human, and how small compassionate acts can extinguish hate and lead to redemption.      Quite frankly, Magnolia adds very little to these big issues that hasn't been said already.  The movie is more of a stunt show showing these ideas in rapid fire action, rather than contemplating them.  This is a movie that prefers to yell rather than whisper, but succeeds because of its creativity, ambition, and fearless risk taking with the material.

0143036556|5.0|\\"Collapse\\" is even better than \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". And this time Diamond focuses, not on how environments have shaped people, but how we have transformed our environments. He looks at various places which suffered environmental collapse in the past like Yucatan or Greenland, then at some relative success stories like Japan or the Dominican Republic. He mainly covers places where he has both personal experience and great background knowledge. The resulting tour is marvelously insightful, and close to the finest non-fiction writing out there. But his examples leave out the sites of history's greatest environmental collapses and challenges, across North Africa and the Middle East.<br /><br />--author of The Gardens of Their Dreams: Desertification and Culture in World History

0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult's idea for My Sister's Keeper is one that i have never seen before and really portrays the life of a family going through this trauma very accurately.  Anna Fitzgerald, a donor for her sister who is diagnosed with a very severe case of lukemia, sues her family for making her the donor even though she has no say in the matter.  Picoult captures each character's view on the situation by making a new voice for each chapter.  The subject of lukemia is extremely well researched and it is a beautifully crafted novel.  To set the story off side of the Fitzgerald family, she also developes a new story line into the book which ties itself into the Fitzgerald family.  It is one of the best books I have ever read and I will only pass on posotive reviews.  So touching from the moment I picked it up until the moment I put it down...this definitely deserves an applaud. Nice work Jodi!
1592289444|1.0|In the world of modern Hollywood the Suspension of one's disbelief seems to be a critical skill.  However, no matter how highly honed one's \\"suspension\\" skills they are likely inadequate to carry a reader through this saga.<br /><br />In 1939 Cavalry officer Slavomir Rawicz was arrested by the NKVD and taken to Moscow.  At Kharkob he was interrogated, tortured, and poorly fed before his trial. Afterwards Rawics is imprisoned in Lubyanka in Moscow where the torture continued.  Rawics, convinced that a confession would mean certain death, resists his captors.  Rawics is found guilty of spying and sentenced to 25 years of hard labor in a Siberian prison camp.  His journey to Irkutsk is a multi-week ordeal alongside thousands of others.  This journey involved a, a train car where men are packed so tightly that one cannot sit, followed by a multi-day hike at gunpoint across a snowy landscape to the location of camp 303.  Once there Rawic and other survivors are asked to build the camp from the ground up.<br /><br />Pg 80+ or so<br /><br />At this point I put the book down.  I could not longer suspend my disbelief.  With the assistance of Google it was not hard to discover that the veracity of the \\"The Long Walk\\" has long been in question.  It is also not difficult to find evidence that disproves, or at least seriously questions, much of what is claimed in this book ([...]).<br /><br />However, hard evidence is not really needed unless a reader is in the market for a Bridge in Brooklyn.  Comic books are well written, but we all know that there is no man faster than a speeding bullet, and Rawics, in \\"The Long Walk\\" comes close to such imagery, by making an incredible journey, building his own prison, planning an escape in short order, and then an incredible escape that involved a 4000 miles journey across the Gobi dessert, across the Himalayas in the middle of winter, and a sighting of a Bumble.  Lucky for Yukon Cornelius - Bumbles bounce...oh sorry, getting confused.<br /><br />This Story gets three stars, but minus 2 for the derogation of the publisher The Lyons Press.  There is no recorrd of camp 303, nor is there any record of Rawics seven compatriots Zygmunt Makowski, Anton Paluchowicz, Anastazi Kolemenos, Eugene Zaro, Zacharius Marchikovas, Smith, and a Polish women named Krystyna.  In short the publisher took the uncorroborated story of one man and pased it off as fact.

0446615625|2.0|I'd read all of David Baldacci's novels and anticipated settling down for a good long read, however, that wasn't the case. This is my second time starting this book and I just can't get past the first few chapters. It just doesn't hold my attention like his previous titles. For those of you reading Baldacci for the first time please don't let this novel turn you off to his other titles. I started reading his books after seeing the movie Absolute Power with Clint Eastwood. Absolute Power was his first novel and after reading that I was hooked. Several of his novels have reached number 1 on the NY Times bestseller list. I'm hoping that his next book will restore my faith in him.

1400062756|3.0|The review by C. Daly sums it up pretty well.  The idea for the book is great, that people have the ability to move from a \\"fixed\\" mindset to a \\"growth\\" oriented one.  It's filled with examples of the differences between the two and why a growth mindset will ultimately bring you more satisfaction, better performance, etc. <br /> <br />Look, I agree with the idea, but I don't really see how this book will help me move to the \\"growth\\" mindset.  After chapter 3, I wondered if the book was all just stories and anecdotes, and I can tell you after finishing it that my fears were confirmed.  I've learned very little about how to actually move to the \\"growth\\" mindset other than some basic ideas which amount to affirmations.   <br /> <br />Towards the end, she talks about how she gave a workshop for 7th graders teaching them the growth mindset, but that it took weeks, and wasn't really fit for a book like this.  The problem is that this is exactly what I (and others) purchased the book for! <br /> <br />Overall, I'm very disappointed, but I'm giving it 3 stars because I think the idea is great and it sounds like there's some solid research behind it.  I look forward to continuing my research about this elsewhere.   <br /> <br />My recommendation is to google Dweck or look up the NYMag article about this topic and save yourselves the 20 bucks and several hours on this book. <br /> <br />

074356619X|5.0|A friend recommended I get this book/CD after hearing me talk about not being where I want to be in life. Later that night I just so happened catch the Oprah show in which she did a follow up to this book and heard numerous success stories. I thought that this must be a sign and ordered my copy first chance I got. If you are a somewhat religous person or have listened to any motivational speakers whatsoever then the concept in The Secret is something you've already heard (think positive, count your blessings, act as if), but it's great to hear it in a version that is timely and fresh. The fact that its on a CD makes it great to listen to at night before falling asleep or in the morning while you're preparing for your day.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|This us an unbais review, i've never played the games before, and only heard about the games about 4 months prior to seeing the film and have no idea what the plot is about <br /> <br />now onto the review: <br /> <br />Atmosphere <br />this movie was all about atmosphere. the visuals were stunning and the soundtrack kept me on my toes constantly. the creepiness alone is enough to make me give this film a good score, but that isnt the only reason <br /> <br />Plot <br />I love this movie for the plot (yeah i know, i'm one of maybe 3 who do) the plot totally made sense to me and definitely is a thinker, if your an airhead and dont use your brain too often, it will not make sense to you. while the story telling was abstract, all the facts were there, you just have to look for them. <br /> <br />Acting <br />this is where most people have problems, they say that the acting was horrible. i disagree, i said i didnt play silent hill, but that doesnt mean i dont play any video games, and i can surmise that the acting style (and even camera angles) are meant to mimic the game. evidence of this is towards the end, there is a huge white screen which IMO resembles a humorous loading screen. <br /> <br />Overall <br />I thought this was a great film, and it definitely was worth it. if you got confused, just be a little more attentive, the plot is there.  <br /> <br />5 stars! great film, not too many will understand though >_&lt;

1401207529|5.0|Forget \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" (also by Frank Miller), THIS is the best Batman book ever written, by a mile.  I can't say enough good things about this book.  The story is so good it's almost incomprehensible, and the art is just as amazing.  The book follows both Jim Gordon and Bruce Wayne, surprisingly giving a little bit more focus to the former, as they experience the corruption of Gotham City firsthand and work to defeat it.  If you've seen the movie \\"Batman Begins\\", which draws much of its inspiration from this book, then you'll have a pretty good grasp of whats going on here.  If you've never read Batman or even a comic before, this is a great place to start, and if you're a lifelong fan, this is a must buy for you too.  Highly, highly recommended.

B000NA28IE|2.0|I have to say one thing upfront: I have never read Eragon, or its sequel, Eldest. I'm walking into this story completely fresh without hopes of \\"better than the book\\". In that regard, I simply cannot figure out just how this story got published. Not only is it derivative and oddly has some parts that seems stolen, it's not even an interesting story by any stretch. Of course you wouldn't think so considering the abundance of special features which suggests this is like some prestige title, or simply giving off the impression it's more important than it is. It's not, but then again it's not completely without merit; it's just you have to look really hard to find it. <br /> <br />In the land of Alagaesia, dragon riders were once the powerful group of people who wielded special abilities and were able to ride powerful fire-breathing dragons. But one dragon rider, Galbatorix, all but wiped out the dragons and thanks to him, the land is in turmoil. Enter Eragon, a 17 year old farmboy who discovers a blue egg one night which eventually hatches and a blue dragon appears. Eragon is now the main focus of Galbatorix and his right-hand man Durza, who is a wizard or as they're called here, a \\"Shade\\". With the help of Brom, an older man with a talent for how to survive in the world (read: a former warrior), and Arya, a beautiful Elf princess, Eragon has to work together with his dragon, Saphira, to bring down Galbatorix. <br /> <br />Even typing that, I couldn't help but thinking how nerdy it would sound with people asking if I made it up. Nope, it's all the story you need. It's unbelievably hard to get into the story when you keep seeing familiar plot devices, not just in the story but the film itself. Since it is an adaptation, the very book will have story elements similar to Star Wars (farm boy Eragon with uncle who becomes a Dragon Rider = Luke with uncle who becomes a Jedi) to Lord of the Rings (elf princess Arwen = elf princess Arya, enemy Ra'zac = Uruk-Hai/Orc). But worseis the familiar scenes like when Durza addresses his minions in a scene eerily similar to Saruman addressing his minions before Helm's Deep. Durza might as well shout \\"to war!\\". <br /> <br />So the story's way too familiar so how's the casting? It's hard to imagine a talented pool of actors looking so uninterested. At least Jeremy Irons and Robert Carlyle act like they're trying but everyone else is either haphazardly directed or they have a \\"this is a nerd movie so act accordingly\\" look. Only bright spot is Sienna Guillory since she just looks so cute. Now did they do anything right in the film? Sure, some of the dragon effects - some - look pretty convincing and like a lot of people thought, the box sure does look neat but other than that you tend to look hard for the good parts.  <br /> <br />This bad a movie you'd think the studios would cheap us out on special features right? Nope since we got tons of stuff from looks into the characters, the effects, interviews with the author where he reveals some tiny insights about the trilogy (which'll most likely have even more lifted stuff in book 3). It's quite an ingenious move though: pack the DVD with tons of features to give the impression this is like Lord of the Rings or films by Ridley Scott that are filled to the brim with special features. But in the end it's a case of either misguided optimism (\\"I don't know what people are complaining about, we made a great movie!\\" attitude) or just sucker people in thinking this is a purchase-worthy package. <br /> <br />It's a sad day when the only things you remember are the cover art, a beautiful actress and the notion that the story seems like a big combination of everything in sci-fi and fantasy literature. To paraphrase a quote from Treebeard: there's no curse in the language of Man, Tree or Elvish for the travesty that is Eragon.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|No one would have ever believed before that Rocky Balboa would go six rounds as far as Hollywood was concened but it has. if they hadnt made his son a lot older in this I really think there could have been a Rocky seven where he trains his son to go out there and duke it out for the title and surprise win it for dad.of course though Dad had to be older for this script.Other then that this most beloved series has facinated people over the years and even decades.My first rocky I ever saw was three and I just had to see the other two.About that time Rocky four was in production with Dolph Lundgren and and when I saw it in theaters fans cheered on the italian stallion.it was so loud from fans in there when he knocked out the russian it was deafening.Then when number five came out and the fight did not for once take place in the ring  Once again the Philedelphia Iron man came through.I thought thats it what a way for a series to go out.Shame that its over with now after five films .NNNNNOOOOOOO not yet.In this last installment the gloves go one one more time to prove that when you love something so much.When you want to go one more time to prove something. When your hungry for just one last time its magic within you that keeps you going.Rocky started out going the distance with Apollo Creed.he didnt win the title but showed what he had.After six films Rocky Balboa has shown that the old lion can still bite the young lion.Just ask Mason \\"THE LINE\\"Dixon.Rocky stepped over that line and showed Dixon a few things win lose or draw if you have heart you can do it.Rocky is one of the true American icons in the movies and we would all do well to follow his example.Not just this movie but the whole series is a perfectly landed KNOCKOUT PUNCH!!!!!
B000NA28IE|5.0|For those who criticize this film I say...lighten up! Let the simple joy of a simple story about good versus evil take over. All the elements are there: beautiful scenery, attractive hero and heroine, lovable dragon, evil antagonists, and victory for what is good. I found myself letting go of my jaded critical sense and becoming a child again, at least for the duration of the movie. Surely, the heart can overpower the intellect in the cause of art...at least once in a while. The story was written by a young man for those who can share his child-like spirit. I had no problem doing this. I loved the movie. My wife did not care for the film. So what? Let those who can do so recapture their childhood again and enjoy a beautiful experience. Let's face it, any dragon with the voice of a young woman can't be all bad. Enjoy!
0374105235|2.0|While I am awestruck at Mr. Beah's journey,I found his writing to lack fluidity and color. It read more like a dry recounting of his experiences than an emotional expository piece. It did make me feel enormously grateful for my life as an American. He is a truly remarkable young man.
1582701709|1.0|This isn't a book, it's a collection of silly bumper stickers. I think its basic premise is even harmful: that we can control what happens to us -- EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO US -- with our thoughts. Have a disease? You caused it by negative thoughts. Are you poor? You caused it by negative thoughts. Do you want to be Miss America? Well then, just THINK it, because even if you're a 50 year old, ugly, humpbacked, obese MAN, then you WILL be Miss America, because you send out that Positive Energy into the Universe. What a ripoff. Step right up folks, and fork over your $14.95. You won't be able to make things happen with only your thoughts--but you will definitely help make Rhonda Byrne really, really rich.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This is without a doubt the best film noir film released in the past two decades! Bryan Singer, working on a very low budget, delivers a high quality film that stands just as strong now as it did upon release in 1995. The story unfolds at a very deliberate intoxicating pace, and the characters are all so believable, even though some of them may or may not be fictional to suit what may or may not be fictional accounts of certain events in the film. Kevin Spacey, Gabrielle Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, Benecio Del Torres, and Chaz Palminteri turn in tour-de-force performances in this stunning crime-caper film noir masterpiece from the director of the \\"X-Men\\" trilogy (which I've yet to see), and \\"Apt Pupil\\", a classic film based on the Stephen King novella. The story is so twisted and convoluted that at film's end, you're still left wondering WHO IS Keyser Soze?. Even when you think you have a grasp on things and have everything figured out (even after the film's final twist), it still leaves the viewer reeling, not really sure if they have figured out just WHO the real Keyse Soze is or not, if there even is a Keyser Soze.<br />And, that is how great film noir is supposed to work. Think \\"The Big Sleep\\", a story so twisted that allegedly the screenwriter didn't even know who 'done it' at the film's end. This is definetly a five star film (I would rate it higher if Amazon allowed such, giving it a ten or higher) that any film buff should add to their collection. I know that I am glad to own this modern day masterpiece. Comparable in some ways to John Carpenter's \\"In The Mouth of Madness' in that it spirals and twists into an ending that will leave you utterly breathless.<br />This is a film that will still be talked about in another ten years from now. Thank you.

B000QUCNOK|2.0|Who knew there could be such terror and mysticism surrounding the scent of a photogenic woman? Well, as Toucan Sam says, \\"The nose knows.\\" And what the nose knows seems to be what the eyes know, except that what separates the killer in \\"Perfume\\" from an inbred madman of \\"The Devil's Rejects\\" ilk is that Jean-Baptiste doesn't rape his victims. This makes him merely misunderstood and lovelorn. So it's like \\"Interview With a Vampire\\" or the dracula movie with Keannu Reeves, DC's Sandman, \\"The Crow,\\" The Penguin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame -- just another tortured soul looking for a woman who can melt his frigid heart. I mean I like how women smell too but if I went around killing them to capture their scent, I wouldn't garner much sympathy and, not being a celebrity, I would probably even do some jail time. Somehow, up on the big screen, this sort of thing is considered \\"romantic.\\" A 40-foot head uttering such things as, \\"I can only tickle the ivories properly if the piano wire is fashioned from virgins' guts\\" has a good chance of making a female theatergoer swoon as long as the maniac looks like a Calvin Klein model.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, \\"Perfume\\" is little more than a Loreal commercial if directed by M. Night Shyamalan. You don't merely suspend your disbelief for this movie, you take it to court and slap it with a permanent injunction. Unless you buy the idea that a man on a platform can wave a hanky sprinkled with a perfume concoction so olfactorily appealing he gains complete control over the crowd below.<br /><br />But what am I saying? We're talking about a romance here, albeit a slightly mean-spirited and unrealized one, so reason has no use here. And you just can't break passion down like a scientific formula ... er, wait, that's what this movie just did.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I would rather roll myself in syrup and bed down in a nest of Fire Ants than have to watch this utterly horrible and pointless film again.  Pointless - lame story, weak plot that never develops that cannot be saved even with the good acting. <br /> <br />Why is the Japanese Girl constantly getting naked and wanting to be felt up?  And what does this have to do with Brad Pitt's wife being shot?  Or her Father who gave the gun to the guy who gave it away to his goat herding neighbor, who's son accidentally shot Brad Pitt's Wife just before the nanny back at home decided to take their kids to Mexico to see her son get married only to find out she must have forgotten that she is an illegal alien who's drunk nephew cant get them back over the border because he can't keep his temper at the border.  Nothing?  Nothing at all. <br /> <br />My suspicion is that this film is actually a collection of edited clips that were cut out from other good films and then spliced together with the common theme of.... wait for it.... 'dont trust people who dont speak your language' -  Only to make it look like the 4 stories are intertwined. <br /> <br />Not since 'Lost in Translation' has such a steaming pile of Dung been accredited with so much accolade.  This film would do more for the World if it were burned as fuel to heat a Siberian Home in the dead of winter.  At least 5 minutes of heat would do someone some good. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt - you owe me an apology and 2 hours of my life back.  Your decision to take the role in this movie is only eclipsed by your decision to leave Jennifer Aniston for Angelina Jolie. <br />Get your head examined - your starting to turn into the guy you played in 12 Monkeys.

B000NA28I4|1.0|it is so bad i could not even finish watching the DVD.  this is just another of the tired hollywood underdog movies, change stars wars \\"the force\\" for a dragon and that is the movie.  except this one makes no sense at all, is cliche filled and is terrible.  a question i have is, why is the leader of the whatchamacallitsecretninjaguys black when there every other character in the movie is white?  the typical pass the torch scene, or sword, is done no less than 3 times between eregon and jeremy irons character.  so what is eragon? is it dragon with an e instead?  i thought it may be a name of a place, castle or something but some dumb kid? give me a break.  john malkovich is in this movie just to make some $ and is a clownish bad guy.  why is the evil wizard so scared of some old bald dork king?<br /><br />this movie makes no sense, it has no story, the acting is bad, it is full of stupid cliche's and must have been written for the D&D dork crowd that would find this drivel entertaining.<br /><br />yuck!!!!!!!!!!
0374105235|5.0|<br />\\"A Long Way Gone\\" is a powerful testament to the tragic lives of children in Africa who have been forced into the ranks of government and rebel armies, or who willingly enlisted in a desperate attempt to survive. It is a story that will touch your heart deeply- one that will remain in your thoughts long after reading it.  <br /> <br />Guided by the poignant voice and memories of Ishmael Beah, readers are offered a first hand glimpse into the terrifying lives of these children, caught up in wars between the very adults they trusted to protect them. It is a story of loss, fear, separation and finally, a story of hope; hope that one day the wars will end and the children of Africa, like Ishmael, can return to their former carefree lives of just being -children.  <br /> <br />Joan Hecht - Author, The Journey of the Lost Boys - A story of courage, faith, and the sheer determination to survive by a group of young children called \\"The Lost Boys of Sudan.\\" <br /> <br />

B000069AUI|5.0|The four stages of Brit-Pop:<br /><br />1)  Oasis / Blur<br /><br />2) Radiohead / The Verve<br /><br />3) The genre takes several years off.<br /><br />4) Coldplay.<br /><br />For the past seven years, no Easy Listening artist has been able to touch Coldplay.  And 2002's A Rush of Blood to the Head is Chris Martin's masterwork.  A Rush of Blood to the Head makes pretty much all other modern Ballad-bands look silly in their efforts (The Fray's How to Save a Life, for example, is a low quality copycat of A Rush/Head). This and Arctic Monkey's Whatever People Say I Am are the best two British albums of the new millennium.  But where Whatever People Say I Am follows the Definitely Maybe / Parklife / Rocking-out formula, A Rush/Head follows the Morning Glory? / OK Computer formula of Ballad-based, intelligent musical progression.  Giant anthems `The Scientist' and `Clocks' are the new decade's `Wonderwall' and `Champagne Supernova.' `God Put a Smile on Your Face' might be the best song of Coldplay's career - a near perfect blend of high energetic percussion, memorable acoustic melodies and soaring, powerful vocals on the part of Chris Martin.  `Daylight' is a Dark Side of The Moon / OK Computer influenced gem, and the staple alternative of `In My Place' is a better version of Oasis's `Stand By Me.' One hidden song is the closing `Amsterdam,' a truly awesome display of progressive, `Bohemian Rhapsody'-style Easy Listening.  All the songs are damn good, even if the likes of `Green Eyes' sounds a little too much like a County song for comfort.  Given the popularity that Coldplay has already amassed, A Rush of Blood to the Head will go down inn history as a classic of the post-Rock era.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|I didn't expect much out of this move. Rocky V was hard to stomach, well, actually anything after rocky II was not easy.  But Stallone put together a decent movie here. I admit, it moved slowly at first, and I did get kinda sick of all the reminicing and wanted more boxing, but hey, it did deliver in the end, and it true rocky style.  Talia Shire, Adrian, was not in this movie, but much of the movie revolved around her spirit.  I wonder if after rocky V she said she'd rather be dead than be in another rocky movie.  Well, now she probably wants her publisist dead for not getting her into it.  Oh well, the movie is decent, good action, and good message. And his son Robert, all grown up, but how do he escape the shadow of a champ...learn to become one yourself. Good movie entertainment, Rocky fans enjoy.
B00008OLYN|5.0|\\"Damnation\\" is one of the best and most unique releases in Opeth's ever growing resume of impressive recordings.  Originally planned as a mellow companion piece for the experimental death metal of \\"Deliverence,\\" the material proved to be strong enough to stand on its own two weary feet.  By no means the standard thrown together soft songs one would expect from a metal act, the band and genius producer, Steve Wilson, put as much effort and ambition into the recordings as they did on the heavier counterpart. Oddly enough, what could have been their most limited album ends up being perhaps their most adventerous.     Akerfeld and Lindgren's expressive electirc guitars weep and moan like melancholy ghosts, while the folky acoustics are seductively dark and mysterious.  Lopez(drums) and Mendez(bass) form the backbone of the album with tight tragic grooves you can tap your foot to.  Eerily filling out the background Wilson uses spooky organs, keys, piano and other subtle effects to enhance the bittersweet rainy day atmpshere. While the music could be described as mellow there is often a nervous, suspenseful energy as well as not so vague hints of something more sinister perhaps even evil lurching beneath the surface.  In top form, Akerfeldt convincingly croons the gloomy lyrics like a long dead phantom longing for the return of a lost love that will never come back; his weary voice frail but incredibly rich in understated emotion.      Despite the group's progressive rock roots and influences, most of the songs are tightly structured in a digestable pop format complete with tension building verses and releasing memorable choruses you can sing a long to.( Though the music is a great deal more busy and dense than most pop structured rock obviously.)  The urgent but lengthy opener \\"Windowpane\\" is the exception with it's tasteful solos and instrumental passages. Other exceptions include: the mourning guitar led instrumental \\"End Credits\\" and the quiet bluesy Avant Garde of \\"Weakness \\".  Other highlights include the climatic \\"Closure,\\" which is the only time the band really breaks lose and goes into a lengthy, menacing freak out jam that makes the heavier moments of their other albums sound like child's play; even without the benefit of distorted guitars and growled vocals. \\"Hope Leaves\\"  might also be the band's most beautiful if not sorrowful moment with it's chiming autumn rain melodies and moving vocals.
0743496728|4.0|Can anyone who has read this book explain how Gun B got jammed??? <br />The \\"twist\\" ending explains how it was fired one time, but I am under the impression it should have been fired a second time to jam.   <br /> <br />This is the first Jodi Picoult book I have read.  I really enjoyed it from the beginning.  It was incredible and heartbreaking.  I could not stop reading it, when I had to stop reading, I could not stop thinking about the characters, and could not wait to get back to the story. <br />The characters were very likable, and the description was adequate, not overdone.   <br />I thought the ending was too quick.  It left out a lot of important information and didn't make sense.  I, too, noticed the errors. <br />The last six pages are the reason I only give this book four stars. <br />I will be reading another Jodi Picoult book. <br /> <br />If anyone can explain Gun B being jammed, I would appreciate a reply
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I've never listened to Sigur Ros before today.  I actually heard part of a track from this album on a youtube video, and decided to check them out.  This album will blow you away, it's very moody, very atmospheric, very ethereal, at times angelic, never heavy but utterly moving.  What a find!  Check this album out as soon as you can, and let others with a brain for music take a listen, you and they will not be disappointed.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I purchased tickets for my family for an upcoming WICKED performance in Denver this summer, so I decided to buy the soundtrack to get an idea of the music we were going to hear.  (What was I going to force my sons to listen to??!) Well - I haven't been able to listen to anything else since!  The music (and lyrics) are terrific!   Even the kids are now looking forward to seeing the play!  The lyrics will give away some of the plot, but not all of it.  The soundtrack is fantastic, and I highly recommend it!
B000M5AJQS|4.0|I did like the acting. In particular I thought that Jack Nicholson was good.  <br /> <br />It had many interesting twists. Although I did think that Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio looked too close so it was hard to tell them apart. I know it was purposely done  but I think it did cause some confusion.  <br /> <br />My main criticism was the ending which did not make sense. With everyone dying, I found it hard to believe that Matt Damon could come up with a credible story to get him off the hook. If the police think that Leonardo DiCaprio is a good guy who did the shooting that killed all those people. Then Matt Damon getting shot at the end in a scene that made even less sense. <br /> <br />Still it was a decent movie. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0399103422|5.0|If I read this when it came out, it must have been in paperback.  The movies were stupendous.  So recently I thought I would read the book (again?)  Bad idea.  I was trapped by Puzo's amazing writing and had to buy all the sequels and about everything else Puzo ever wrote. Haven't yet read them all yet, but I am beginning to speak Sicilian. The author's ability to read the human soul is uncanny.  No wonder his books are said to have been approved by the mafia. They tell the story of people like all others (some good, some bad), who have elevated the concept of family above that of all other allegiances, and for good reason.  Considering the \\"families\\" as countries, it seems that they are no worse and often better than other \\"countries\\" in how they care for themselves and relate to other nations.

B000007T2Z|5.0|Imagine the death of rock & roll as we know it.  What would it sound like if rock was taking it's last breath?  How would you sum up a life of rock and describe it as you lye suffering from the pain of knowing that death is certain with the next few days.   <br />     This album summarizes the above questions perfectly to me.  The music moves slowly from a near stop to peaks of pure anxiety and back down again.  As if a dying person was able to conjure enough energy every 5 or 10 minutes to express all of their lifes feelings...and then resting their eyes while they grasp for enough energy to continue their story...over and over until they ultimately pass. <br />     Slow moving progessions of a story well told slowly but anxiously build to extremely energetic peaks of excitement.  All of this done with a powerful guitar and drum supported by a symphany of instruments...almost like a soundtrack to life, thus my point.

B0000026DJ|5.0|Diesel and Dust is the perfect merger of rock and social progressivism.  Never has a record compelled me to feel as moved as this one, particularly on songs like 'Warakurna', 'Beds are Burning', 'The Dead Heart', or 'Dreamworld'.  Never has anyone described with such power and poignancy the plight of the underclass or displaced minorities (in this case the Aboriginal peoples of Australia) in a manner that anyone can relate to.  The evocative words (\\"The western desert lives and breathes at 45 degrees\\"), the tones used on Rob Hirst's drums, Jim Moginie's and Martin Rotsey's dueling acoustic guitars on the 'Dead Heart', and Peter Garrett's gravel like edge to his singing on tracks like 'Put Down that Weapon', 'Arctic World' or 'Sell My Soul' evoke the imagery of a band that traveled for miles through sandy hot desert lands in pickup trucks and tried to make sense of their experiences upon returning to Sydney.  The music intimates the myriad of emotions that the band experienced after meeting and living among simple people, witnessing their stories of hardship and difficulties and the uplifting hope and dignity they found among them.      The record, despite its serious themes, is life affirming, as the defiantly rocking closer \\"Sometimes\\" appropriately underscores.  Midnight Oil believes in the redemptive power of the human spirit in spite of the injustice and inequities in our world today.      From a musical standpoint, each song is flawlessly crafted and produced.  Warne Livesey does an oustanding job of integrating the sounds of the earth and of the band, with the sounds of electronic beats and synthesizers.  This is a modern rock record to be sure, in spite of its folksy songs and socially conscious subject matter.  This record and \\"10,9,8...\\" were Midnight Oil's finest hours.  However, this record has a power all its own, as any time we see hardship, suffering and inequality in this world, all we in the west need to do is listen to this record to understand howit tastes, smells and feels to be in that condition.  A remarkable record.  One for the ages.  Get it if you don't have it.

B000NA28I4|4.0|Eragon is a farm boy from a small town where life is simple, until one day he happens upon his destiny. While out hunting he comes across something which he mistakes for a stone, but is really an egg that hatches...a dragon. He then learns that he didn't find the egg, but rather the egg found him. A dragon will not hatch until it comes into the hands of the person it has chosen to be its Rider. As the next Dragon Rider, Eragon poses the greatest threat to the tyrannical king. And like it or not, Eragon was chosen to champion good against evil. <br /> <br />I know, I know. It's a kids movie. And it has dragons...and magic. So how good could it really be? But, for me, the reaction was more like: It has a dragon!!! And magic!!! <br /> <br />Call me crazy, but I loved it. <br /> <br />I cannot explain what it was that led me to stay perched at the edge of my seat in anxious anticipation of what would come next. Especially since, for the most part, I knew what was coming next. I have read the book, so I was familiar with the story. The movie is not 100% true to the book, but rather than picking apart the differences, I was able to enjoy this story, a different way, a second time around. While I enjoyed the book, it didn't come close to energizing me as much as the movie. <br /> <br />I just saw the movie and already I can't wait to see it again. I cannot recommend this movie to as many people as I wish I could. If you see it, I can only hope it gives you the same youthful excitement that it gave me.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I have never liked John Mayer before this CD.  I listened to \\"Coninuum' online before I bought it.  I really love it.  It is kind of bluesy, good guitar playing, and good words.

I wish most books were made to look this easy and pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br />However, content-wise, I suggest reading Maxwell Maltz's classic \\"Psycho Cybernetics\\" instead - it's tighter, less whimsical/airy-fairy and provides much more guidance to achievements and positive \\"state of mind\\".   <br /> <br />I find it funny that something as well-known as visualisation could be re-packaged as \\"The Secret\\" - talk about nice packaging and marketing! <br /> <br />In short - nice packaging.

B000LXH0AE|3.0|After a very enjoyable first thirty minutes or so, I had a voice in MY head saying \\"They'll never maintain this for an entire film\\".  And darn if that voice wasn't right.  Gyllenhaal was the only actor to breath any life into her character.  The scenes with Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah felt as colorless and bland as Thompson's apartment.  Likewise, Ferrell and Hoffman's scenes were highly uneventful.  I suppose Ferrell played his character about as well as could be expected considering the character was a simple guy who lived a very routine lifestyle, but he only seemed to shine while in the glow of Gyllenhaal's ever increasing star power.

B0000VCZKM|4.0|By now, everyone probably knows the story of Annie (Aileen Quinn), the little tomboy who longs for her real parents to take her away from the orphanage. Instead, she is adopted for a week by billionaire Oliver Warbucks (Albert Finney) under the care of his secretary Grace (Ann Reinking). They fall in love with her and try to help her find her real parents who we find out are really dead. The orphan home's caretaker Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett), her criminal brother (Tim Curry), and his moll (Bernadette Peters) decide to impersonate Annie's parents to get the cash reward, but the orphans get wind and try to stop them.<br /><br />No other version compares to this one; the cast is outstanding. Quinn is appropriately innocent, but belies intelligence under her curly red hair. Burnett is wonderful as always, playing a personally triumphant part; her parents were both alcoholics. Curry plays a menace truthfully, and yet he's still a bit likable- at least in the beginning. Even Peters' role stands out; she was wonderful during this era. Although musicals tend to be a bit silly sometimes, this one straddles the fine line between fantasy and believability very well. Viewers of any age can find themselves enraptured in every bit of the story.<br /><br />And the music! It has really earned a place in Americana. Who doesn't know the hopeful song \\"Tomorrow?\\" The music has become so popular that even Jay-Z sampled \\"Hard Knock Life.\\" Some of the lesser knowns are amazing as well. \\"Little Girls\\" features many clever lines. \\"Let's Go to the Movies\\" is very fun and serves as blanket praise for the classic movie era. \\"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\\" is catchy and wonderfully represents old time radio advertisement songs. \\"Easy Street\\" is tons of fun thanks to Burnett, Curry, and Peters and their comic performances.<br /><br />There are certainly flaws, the most glaring having to do with the time period. The opener hails the year: 1929. However, the film does not stick to that year. It includes Franklin D. Roosevelt as a character, and yet he was not elected president until 1932. Furthermore, the New Deal discussed in the film did not come about until 1933. Also, the film everyone goes to see in the theater is Camille from 1936. Even the most avoidable of mistakes occurs. In the beginning of the film, one learns that Annie is ten years old, but later, when reading her birth certificate, one learns that she was born in 1922. However, one with no interest in history could easily ignore these mistakes as they do not detract from the story.ick to that year. It includes Franklin D.

006112429X|5.0|I read through many of the reviews and noticed that not one person mentioned knowing someone like Kevin.  I picked up this book after reading a review in an old magazine, not realising how hard it would hit home.  I absolutely loved this novel, well written, encompassing, scary as hell, and sad.  My nephew \\"Mike\\" is a bad seed.  He committed murder/robbery/arson at the age of 17yrs and is going to jail for 25yrs in July.  My sister and I knew when he was born, that something was wrong.  All the traits that the character \\"Kevin\\" has, we have seen \\"Mike\\" exhibit.  I kept my own kids away from him, period.  My sister always thought that if she nurtured him enough, these nasty traits would go away.  Eventually, she began to fear him, of upsetting him, of what he would do to his siblings.  \\"Mike\\" has no empathy and a high threshold of pain - which - leads me to believe that contributes to his hate-filled antics.  Yes, she took him to therapy, he was labeled ADD & bi-polar, the medication slowed him down a little, but the anger was still there. <br /> <br />This book will linger with you for days.  When you read it, remember that there are monsters that are child-sized.

0060899220|5.0|what?  a COOKING book is one of the most insane books you can read??  YES, i tell you!  this book has it all.. sex, drugs.. lots of drugs.  how do i know it's a good book?  how about because i don't even like cooking and i have no clue what foods he's talking about in this book because i've never seen them, but i STILL read it more than once.      i do have a little criticism for this book.. for one thing, anthony bourdain is completely insane.  i'm not saying that he's a bad person, or uninteresting.. i'm simply saying he's pretty crazy.  i can't view someone as truly sane who never wants any time to themselves, who only wants to cook 24 hours a day, and who expects the people working for him to do the same.  anthony bourdain either doesn't have much compassion or wants it to seem that way, as he describes his job requirements for his workers, like how they must always work even if they're sick, etc.  then he goes on to describe his hero, a restaurant manager who sounds like such a crazy jerk, i wouldn't even want to meet him, much less work for him.      to his credit, it seems bourdain works harder than anyone, but like i said, he's insane.  the other criticism i have is that he tries too hard to come across as a cold-hearted person and doesn't reveal enough about himself.  we get this book about a guy obsessed with cooking, and guess what?  he never even really says WHY.  why is it that for most people it's enough to eat great food, but for him, he is so motivated to work constantly every day to make the greatest food he can?  it's a fascinating subject, but there is no introspection on his part about what drives him.  other than that, this is a great book.  \\"heat\\" is another great book on cooking.      if you're considering taking a job as a cook in a high-scale restaurant, you definitely want to read this book, as it will send you running as fast as you can run to a DIFFERENT job.  and there's another question..  what drives the cooks under bourdain to work such a horrible job?

B00003CX9E|5.0|For what it is, Citizen Kane is damn near perfect. But it really does have flaws just as any movie does. Critics rave about the camera angles, the script, the story.... As a film buff and aspiring filmmaker, I cannot discount the greatness of Citizen Kane. But it was only until such filmmakers as Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese, Francis Ford Coppola came along that we really did start to see just how influential this film was.  <br /> <br />Before and after Kane, Frank Capra, John Ford, Cecil B. DeMille, and Victor Fleming films were really the greatest films in Hollywood. People loved the romantic, soft, sometimes-sentimental Frank Capra pictures... in fact, he was one of the many filmmakers to inspire Steven Spielberg. People loved the harsh but ultimately Hollywood vision of reality in John Ford's masterpieces (The Grapes of Wrath)... and we still do. Cecil B. DeMille was among the chief epic filmmakers... and he still is. Then Victor Fleming came along. I know it's hard to say that Gone With the Wind was all due to the greatness of one man, but he sure helped. His other great film that year was the legendary Wizard of Oz which is still a beloved classic for children. However... <br /> <br />Even though Orson Welles gave us the \\"Greatest Film in American Cinema\\" (again, I'm not stating a fact), he still cannot be considered the greatest or most influential filmmaker in the history of film. I believe that top prize will always belong to the unmatched master of suspense, Alfred Hitchock. None of his films suggests influence of Kane. In fact, he made Notorious with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman just a few years before Kane, and that film had some pretty Hitchcock-esque shots. He was his own great filmmaker, he didn't need any influence. <br /> <br />However, Citizen Kane has aged pretty well over the years. It feels real and somewhat modern, it looks real and modern, and it sounds like it could have been made easily today. But, many people have their own favorite film. They will attack anyone who tries to persuade them differently. That's why I think it is almost unwise and definitely unfair for AFI or any critic to dictate to people what the greatest film is. Nothing is set in stone. A lot of the \\"know-nothing\\" audiences still believe Gone With the Wind or Casablanca, Star Wars or Titanic is the greatest. Are these critics elevating themselves above the average moviegoer because of their extensive research, because of all of their experience critiquing movies, because they've watched so many??? <br /> <br />Roger Ebert, who gives an audio commentary to the film... I guess he's trying to say that he's a film historian who knows all there is to know about can... he didn't like Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid. Now, that was a favorite for many moviegoers. He has the brass to put down a movie that so many people love and at the same time, he's telling them what they should see. When film critics can be that influential, I think its time we start thinking about discarding the purpose of such Hollywood bigotry. <br /> <br />Now, I have nothing against him personally, I like Ebert today moreso than I did way back when. He actually was one of the few who defended my favorite film, Titanic when it came out. But, he - like all of the other \\"know-it-alls\\" think they can tell us what is the greatest film. They can't. We're not all wise to the ways of film. We know what we like. I don't adore Citizen Kane, but I respect it just the same.  <br /> <br />I've seen well-over 700 films, including a lot of \\"great\\" films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, and I still prefer Gone With the Wind to Citizen Kane or Casablanca. But, they're all great... just different. <br /> <br />If you're a film scholar, you have to see Citizen Kane once. But do not be persuaded. If your favorite film just so happens to be Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, hold onto that, don't let the \\"know-it-alls\\" tell you different. I'm going to hold onto my love for Titanic.   <br /> <br />PLUS: Let's just keep one thing in mind, this is filmmaking, it's not intended to be absolutely perfect. <br /> <br />
6305508550|4.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  It's about this guy and his friends who work for a computer company who, for all the obvious reasons in corporate America, hate their jobs, so they plot and plan this massive scheme to transfer the company's earnings into their own account. <br /> <br />Though produced in 1999, it's surprisingly not dated, as I just recently viewed it again. It is hilarious, with quotable lines that you remember for years to come.  I think people who are in an office environment can appreciate it the most, yet I don't work in one myself and still fully grok the humor.  I don't think the acting is particularly good, but the dialogue makes up for it.   <br /> <br />There are some very funny sub-plots that add to the main one, like Jennifer Aniston's flair.  My favorite character is Milton, because he is so quirky and over-the-top funny.  And of course Lumberg, the boss everyone loves to hate! <br /> <br /> <br />
B00008A7QK|5.0|This album should really be considered one of the great classics of rock, but seems to often be overlooked. Many people seem to have either never heard of T. Rex, to mistake them for some 80's band (I have no idea what they are talkign about), or to only know \\"Bang a Gong.\\" This album literally has no clunkers; every track is essential. Next to Bowie's indispensable glam albums, this is the best of the genre and really some of the best rock recorded. The orchestration always works, never coming off as too slick etc., and the guitar is really killer. There are great riffs and tasty solos. Several of these songs, such as the hits \\"Jeepster\\" and \\"Bang a Gong,' and the superb should be classic \\"Mambo Sun\\" are simply iresistibly groovin' tracks that make you want to get up and move. \\"Rip Off,\\" the album's closer is an amazing track as well, almost a jazzish punk track, that rocks hard. Really though, any songs that I didn't mention, were omitted for the sake of this review's brevity; in all honesty, every track is not merely enjoyable, but vital, carefully crafted, and simply tremendous. Do not hesitate to get this album; you will be glad you've discovered T. Rex if this is your first exposure to the group, they were a real treasure that's never been appreciated quite the way they deserved (especially Bolan).Few albums are more enjoyable than this one.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|What a refreshing, light-hearted movie. <br /> <br />Russel Crowe does a good job in his role as Max-a-Million, a busy trader in London who goes to Provence, France to handle the estate of his late uncle with whom he spent his summers growing up.  The beautiful scenes captured of rolling hills of vineyards, the chateau, wine cellar, and warm sunsets bring the viewer to a place where you can almost feel and taste that wine glass touching your lips. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a movie that will put you to bed with pleasant dreams at night, this is it.  Nothing bad happens. <br />
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|All the characters/acting in this movie are outstanding. I agree with the other reviewers. THIS is not the Ludlum story. Neverthless, it's one of my favorites movies. Damon is just outstanding. Enjoy the action. It isn't as good as Identity (as a movie), but both are great fun.
B000M341QE|5.0|This is another Scorsese masterpiece.  It has the elements of a classic movie; Great story line, great acting, great written script, and great characters.  It was intriguing, a portrait of human behavior, and the acting in this movie was fantastic in every way, particularly Leo DiCaprio's portrayal of his character.  You could really feel his anxiety and tension building as the movie built.  <br /> <br />There are twists and turns and surprises even to a seasoned and jaded movie-goer. <br /> <br />The script had fabulous turns of phrase and storyline.  The characters were unusual, interesting, believable, and you felt like you got to know them.  You felt their motivations for things, and what they are feeling inside.  There is a particularly amusing supporting role by Mark Wahlberg.  Jack Nicholson added a lot of his own flavor to this movie and his own character, which really flushed out the \\"evils of man.\\"   <br /> <br />Everything about this movie is so good.  Highly recommend viewing it if you haven't already. <br /> <br />
B00023B1LC|5.0|I don't want to mislead you, this is one of my favorite films. I bought the Ludlum trilogy, and they have little to do with this movie and the Supremacy. Given that, this movie is a great thriller, just oustanding. The music is pretty cool too. I could watch it many, many times, and not get bored. The actors are just outstanding - Damon, Franka Potente and all are just outstanding.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Rocky V was awful. I'm so glad Stallone wasn't satisfied with how he ended things. The new movie is the right bookend -- Stallone revisits the series' roots and finds the right tone.<br /><br />Let me reveal my bias -- I loved the first movie. I watched it in theaters more than a dozen times. So let's not waste time with a real review. Let's talk nostalgia. \\"Rocky Balboa\\" ties back into every original subtext. Stallone reinforces his vision by recasting bit players like Pedro Lovell as Spider Rico (a great cameo).<br /><br />The theme hasn't changed. Keep moving forward; don't quit. This time, Rocky is older and wiser. I loved the subtext of a wiser Rocky. I believed.<br /><br />This is an emotionally satisfying movie. If you've followed the series, you've seen the ups and downs. This is the right way to end the series. Anything less would have been unfair to an original and compelling character.
0399241523|4.0|I bought this series for my children - ages 14 and 15. I started reading them too ! I grew up with Ray Bradbury, and while these are not in that category, they are fun and a great read. This series is just plain fun to read.
B00004T9VY|5.0|First off.. I spent years trying to hate Cat Stevens for becoming a radical Muslim...that's becoming a \\"radical\\" Muslim people..He was already a Muslim. I mean advocating the death of a writer (Simon Ruski) for a perceived insult, that must make him an enemy of the U.S right? I grumbled and mumbled doesn't that bastard realize he's a writer too! I put away his records (that's a large round disc of poly-vinyl used in ancient times to reproduce music) and refused to listen to him...then a funny thing happened...I started hearing litle bits and pieces of his music here and there like the outtro on Extras... then I noticed on Amazon that they had remastered his catalog...hmm... interesting... one listen and hooked again. I think this was his sophomore effort and if you only buy one of his albums buy this one, I don't think you can get the spirit of the man or the time's from a \\"best of\\" disc. The pleading timbre in his voice and baritone delivery when others of that era were doing the falsetto...genius...Where do the children play , Wild World , Sad Lisa , Miles from Nowhere..These are \\"thinking mans\\" lyrics somewhat dark and introspective...does anybody get it stuff! The remastering is perfect ,acoustic guitars are separated in the sound stream from each other just enough , the keyboards move in and out from supporting to lead roles ,the percussion and occasional brass or orchestra instrumentation seem to put the Cat squarely in the middle of the soundstage..Very nice! Buy this disc..You probably won't be supporting terrorist if you do..Just damn good music!!
B000KCHZK6|5.0|We have thoroughly enjoyed this CD.  Norah voice is great and so are the songs on this cd.  We play it all the time.
1582701709|1.0|The problem is that we have so many zombies wandering the earth that the secrets that have been exposed and known are lost.  Ultimately the zombies believe everything Al Gore or their pastor tells them and everyone else is a liar.  They fall into the slots so they can get applied labels and, well you know. <br /> <br />The Secret is really nothing more than attitude adjustment and figuring out what you want out of life.  What do you want?  That?  Go get it then, and look around you and notice your surroundings.  I don't have to buy a book that costs more than an hours wage to let me know I have things I can do to improve my life.   <br /> <br />Just remember, it is garbage out, go after what you want, and just do it.  <br /> <br />Why everyone is buying into this book being a \\"revelation\\" is beyond me, but hey, if it will wake up the zombies from their slumber then \\"power to the people\\" might actually happen someday. <br /> <br />Think about it, if you really need a book telling you how to improve your own life and take care of known issues, then you are not independent and smart enough to deserve change in the first place.  Zombies tend to take left turns and so that is why so many curbs have scuff marks on them.
0340838035|2.0|What a disappointment. I've read everything published by Ms. Picoult and loved nearly all of it until this book. She fails to create a plausible picture of the factors compelling Em to be desperately suicidal, and why-oh-why wouldn't Chris try to get the woman he loves help? -- that is help to live, not to die? Unlike Picoult's usual work, The Pact is awkward and slow-moving, and the plot is full of holes. Too bad; not up to Picoult's standards. <br />

0743200748|3.0|This is a very short book, more a collection of short essays than a cohesive treatise on male friendships.  The book praises male friendships, using the friendships between Eisenhower and Patton, Custer and his brothers, and Crazy Horse and He Dog as examples.  But most of the book deals with the author, his friendships, and his relationships with his father and brothers.  These parts of the book are somewhat self-congratulatory yet sad at the same time, because it seems that Ambrose 's relationship with his father was ultimately unsatisfying, though he claims otherwise.  For example, the only conversation that the author had with his father about God or faith, apparently, was a brief conversation during a car ride in which they both agreed that there must be a heaven, since Abraham Lincoln would surely have gone to heaven.   The author also alludes to, but ultimately skims over, his own alcohol abuse.      (If his friendships were so great, as he claims, why did he need to drink so much?)  Overall, though, the book was enjoyable and thought provoking.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|I very bleak but fun look at a dystopian future. A killer virus. Surreal story line and great actors like Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. What's not to like?
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|It is the sexiest masterpiece film and without any sex scene,BRAVO !And so uplifting too:good blood,bad blood or tinted blood,you can love,be loved,be happy,forgive,hope,be redeemed...everything is possible and nothing is ever too late...It also does a wonderful job in clearing your sinus too ! I wish I had bought several hundred shares of Kleenex stocks!All the actors are so real and so convincing ,specially Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens:perfect Jane and Mr.Rochester.They manage to convey all their longings,pains,joy,hope,regrets...it is so well done that we are no longer viewers but participants !Books are great to help us to escape but believe me ,this new Jane Eyre will transport you to The Bronte Era for 4 hrs,it is so beautiful,so touching,so romantique..not to mention the haunting music and divine locations...that you will have a hard time landing !You will want to escape again and again...
B00000G3PA|5.0|This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. It had action, it was funny, sad, and dramatic. Had a perfect cast. They couldn't have made this movie any better, no matter how much money they put in it.
B000ERU9S2|5.0|Worth watching for the car chases alone, good film, cracking pace, great acting, you can see where they got the ideas for the \\"Bourne\\" series watching this, another Jean Reno must see!
B000002U82|5.0|I bought this CD to replace one I lost.  It is exactly the same packaging and same throughout.  Great classic disk.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Cannot rate this film high enough. It is in my top 5 films of all time! <br /> <br />The acting is fantastic, the story gripping, the action feels real, and then you have the wonderful Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman, if you don't see this film, it is your loss.
084428596X|5.0|This is a wonderful reference tool.  It's very understandable, well layed out with many good examples of grammar usage.  This book is a great supplement for classroom or self study. <br /> <br />
B00004TWZF|5.0|One of those films which takes you away from your humdrum life and makes you feel that you are actually in the film. <br />The acting and photography are fantastic, it is a very long film but well worth watching.
0393317552|4.0|Very very interesting... I recommend this book to everyone who wants to know a brief human history of the world in a single book.
0375505091|1.0|GREAT PHOTOS BUT ANNOYING TO LOOK AT!!!!  Visually this book is claustrophobic.  The images seem forced to fit into a book that is too small to hold them. And probably half of the pictures are across the gutter--very annoying.  Sometimes the most important part of the picture is in the gutter.  My personal favorite is Michael Jordan with his nose in the gutter.  Random House, if you are going to do a book on a great photographer like Annie Liebovitz, do a better job than this.

B000MGUZM0|5.0|The more I listen to Neon Bible, the more I am floored by the songs that Arcade Fire have put together in this effort.  For starters, one amazing thing is that Win Butler and company manage to keep within themselves.  This album is not an incredible departure from Funeral.  But the sound is bigger, the lyrics are richer and the impact is deeper.  Every song unfolds slowly and purposefully.  There is not a single bad song on the album.  I have heard some people complain about the production on the album but I personally don't find the production to be problematic.  They use many more instruments than on Funeral, and there is a certain lo-fi quality to the production.  But this what Arcade Fire has always been about in some ways.  We still have a ways to go in 2007, but so far this is album is  the undisputed best album of the year.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I have been a fan of Muse through the years and their progression to this lastest album keeps up the high standard of music Muse has always been able to acheive. A must have for Muse fans and a great album for anyone wanting to hear something special.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I can still remember buying their first album and playing it on my friend's Zenith stereo in his room. We were both amazed and excited by the new sound. It still is my favorite Zep record. This DVD set is great. There is so much on it, I watch just a song or two at a time, as each song is nearly overwhelming. To tell the truth, my favorites are the Danish radio show, and the French tv show on disc 1. The more initmate setting of the Danish set really allows you to appreciate them on a personal level. It's fun to see them playing live, in a dinky local TV station studio, with about thirty 14 year-olds sitting on the floor around them. The French TV show is musically great also: but for me a large part of the enjoyment of that segment is watching the audience. I'v got a huge TV...that allows me to study the people watching this LOUD long-haired British band take over their normally sedate TV show. At first some are giggling, covering their ears, looking on with amusement at best. They stoically endure the first song and applaud politely. The second, when Jimmy starts playing his guitar with the violin bow, and doing something musical with it, not just making noise...well they are realising that yes, this is something  special. The middle aged stage band are on the left side of the audience...and you can see them smiling as Jimmy turns his Telecaster, with the help of his trusty violin bow, into something of a synth/orchestra.  At the end of this song, the clapping is heartfelt and strong, they have won over this French Ed Sullivan-like audience with shear musical talent and passion. Also, as a guitar player, it is extremely fun to jam along with this collection. Confused about how to play a part...just watch his fingers! And yes he plays a psychedelic-painted Tele in the Danish and French shows. No Les Paul in sight at this time. The sound quality is good. Highly recommended.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|The film itself is amazing!  One of my personal favorites in the Bond franchise.    The presentation of the film on DVD is actually pretty good, too.  The visual quality, for standard DVD, is excellent.  The sound quality, too, is pretty good.  No DTS, but decent enough.    The extras are pretty sparse.  No commentary from director or star(s) or anyone.  A few making-of featurettes, which are nice.  No trailer for this particular film, but oddly enough for other films!  The nice thing, at least, is that they restrict all the extras to the 2nd disc, devoting just the movie to the first disc.    But, **BEWARE THE DOUBLE DIP!**  Director Martin Campell is recording a commentary, and he also mentions deleted scenes.  This was confirmed in an interview with a major national newspaper in early March 2007.    [...]

As you are going through third party companies when dealing with second hand things, the cost is not the same for all. It should be noted that, many of us are looking for a bargon but if the end price goes up to more than we would pay for in the stores for a new products, we may look at Amazon as a last resort. I will say that many people look at Amazon as a safe place do to their shopping, sometimes more so than a regular store.

0738702994|5.0|I love this deck. The art work is so beautiful and inspiring. I love learning about all of the Welsh mythology and lore that Ferguson shares. I haven't been disappointed with this deck yet! I especially love that it comes with it's own carrying bag and box to keep everything together. I'm not really in to Welsh lore, but this deck won me over! It's so awsome to learn from a deck more than you expected to in the conventional sense of deck usage!

B000N4SHPS|5.0|Mr Stallone, <br />   Thank you for going to the well one more time.  It doesn't matter if you win or lose, as long as you show up for the fight and give it your best shot.  The last few years have seen quite a few \\"inspirational\\" sports movies, and I usually turn up my nose.  Not this time.  This movie has heart, and in the end, that is what truly matters to blue collar folks who go through the same battles with themselves everyday, looking for some sort of motivation.  You were able to show a caring soul, in \\"Rocky's\\" character, without crossing the overly predictable and cliched themes that a lot of movies would've turned to.  He didn't need a new love, he still loved.
0141301155|5.0|This timeless classic by Roald Dahl is better to read than both movies made to date. While I love both movies, I just find that the story is extraordinary, funny, charming, and delicious.<br /><br />I found that this book allows a child's imagination to run free, beyond all boundaries. What could be better than to read a story about a contest, candy, and the great Willy Wonka. My children and I have read this story over thirty times and it never loses its charm.

B000ETQPYM|3.0|If you are looking for something not very thought provoking and quick, this is it.  I can't say I disliked this book but I can't say that it was good enough to keep or recommend either.  I found myself not caring one way or the other about the characters.  The premise was interesting, I loved the concept however it just didn't work here.  I have far better books to read than to have wasted time on this one. <br />
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Strange as it seems, I watched \\"This Film is Not Yet Rated\\" and \\"Shortbus\\" in the same day. And some part of me wondered ... did John Cameron Mitchell even bother to submit this to the MPAA? Not, of course, because he expected to receive a \\"passing-grade\\" from the prudish parents (and the two members of the clergy) that run the ratings and appeals board ... but simply to force the cloistered collection of puritans to watch couples attempting to negotiate their sexuality.    The fantastic ensemble cast is phenomenal at arousing laughter, compassion, and perhaps a few tears. Moreover, in a weird way, watching Sofia navigate the Shortbus haven is kind of like a return to high-school parties: everyone is making out, someone is crying in the closet, a couple of people are watching television, a group of desperate goofs are playing \\"spin the bottle,\\" and your boyfriend (or girlfriend) is bored. Ohh, and you never leave very satisfied:)    What surprised me was how this film could have been painfully predictable, but was not. For instance, in the film's introduction, Sophia expresses that she has never climaxed with her husband. When she explores Shortbus, she meets Severin (a tortured dominatrix). When the two women bond and become intimate, the viewer is convinced that satisfaction will come from another woman. Not so (thank goodness!). In fact, she is betrayed by Severin's greedy lust. This is an unexpected, painful, and realistic turn for the film. I applaud the fact the Mitchell complicates sex ... there are no easy answers for Mitchell (Thank you!!)     Unlike some of the reviewers here, I do not think \\"less is more.\\" We have lived with \\"less is more\\" for way too long. We Americans think sex is shameful ... and if any films include it, they better be hidden in back rooms ... behind ugly beaded curtains. These films invariably degrade both sexes and they degrade sex itself. This film shows Americans loving-couples (in many cases real-life couples) engaging in consensual sex. It illustrates the complications and beauty of these relationships. Never does it condescend. Instead, it graceful allows its viewers to become welcomed voyeurs ... we learn as we watch. We experience the joy and frustration of these characters. It is ... quite marvelous.    If you are tired of films that ignore the pleasures of sex for women (ignore, or as we learn from \\"This Film is Not Yet Rated,\\" simply are not permitted to show WOMEN enjoying sex), if you are searching for a film which treats the sex-life of gay men with playfulness and respect, if you are desperate for a film which makes sex \\"sexy,\\" messy, and complicated, then give Shortbus your attention.    But if films with gay men pleasuring each other and women finding pleasure at all, turn you off ... well, you may as well return to the area behind the beaded curtain. The rest of us will hope that Mitchell continues to build upon his ground-breaking works!     Thank you, Mr. Mitchell!
B000063DIR|1.0|I won't go in to detail here but as many others have already pointed out the replacement of Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake on this album as well as on \\"Blizzard\\" is inexcusable. While we're at it let's take Geezer Butler and Bill Ward off the first two Sabbath albums! Something tells me Sharon O is behind this. I am absolutely appalled! I can hardly believe it! An outrage!!
B000NA28IE|5.0|Wow! This movie was truly amazing! I just saw it for the first in my living room (I rented it, but plan on purchasing it). You have to understand that I'm a huge fan of the genre. I've been watching fantasy since I was a kid and have seen my share of terrible ones (Conan the Destroyer, Red Sonja, etc ...). I can see how some who are on the realism bandwagon nowadays a la Spider-man, X-men, Superman franchises ... need to start appreciating the fact that Fanatasy is just that: Fantasy. Yes, there were a few issues with the movie such as perhaps not enough character development. But blame the studios who are probably going to release a Director's Cut or something like that. I thought the acting was well done by the entire cast and I followed the story nicely. The actors knew their roles and filled them in magnificently. I was completely engrossed into the movie, so much so that when a very good neighbor friend of mine called while I was in the final battle scene, I completely ignored him and just kept watching.
B0002ZMITY|1.0|As a big fan of the Ali G series and the movie Borat I bought this DVD. <br /> <br />Horrible, Horrible Horrible. <br /> <br />Think of any cheesy 80's movie and this compares.  Overall this movie is as bad as the pathetic Saturday Night Live movies.  Remember the bad ones?  Stuart Saves His Family (Al Franken), It's Pat (Julia Sweeney), The Coneheads, A Night At the Roxbury, Superstar (Molly Shannon).  The Ladies Man (Tim Meadows) was a great cable viewing experience compared to this. <br /> <br />Borat worked because it was a collection of skits loosely tied together, Ali G was a pathetic attempt at cinema.

0618551050|5.0|For anyone interested in the new mysteries of dark energy and dark matter etc. which have unsettled the attitude of \\"nearly finished\\" complacency exhibited by many spokesmen for theoretical physics, this book is a refreshing eye-opener for the interested layman. A new approach, String Theory, which promised a lot twenty five years ago has failed to deliver on its promises yet the aggressive promotion of this research programme and the tribal \\"groupthink\\" mentality of its adherents has led to it gaining the dominant position in terms of monopolizing grants and tenures at elite institutions normally reserved for a proven paradigm which has made successful predictions confirmed by experiment. A failed revolution has become the new \\"normal science\\" paradigm although it is unsuited to tackling most of the fundamental problems.  <br />Most popular science books and TV programmes follow the unquestioning hype approach with infantile sci-fi style visuals and narrators rehashing hubris about pet theories unlocking the keys to supposedly the greatest mysteries of existence. Smolin, once an active participant in the String story, lists the 5 major problems facing theoretical physics and shows that very little progress has been made in resolving these over the last 30 years.  <br />Unlike most physicists (excepting Bohm and Peat)Smolin dares to confront the sociological issues which result in the exclusion of freethinkers who question fundamental assumptions and put forward new ideas. Twenty years ago Rubinstein et al. wrote Science as Cognitive Process showing how a \\"paradigm\\" resembles a mode of cognition/perception and how \\"sciencing\\" resembles tribal rituals and taboos etc. Such \\"us and them\\" attitudes and the hostility to any questioning of basic assumptions means that the philosophically-minded young physicists, interested in the foundations of Quantum Theory etc., are denied career opportunities. The rise of String Theory also smacks of the \\"one true faith\\" zealotry prevalent in Western culture.  <br />Smolin recognises that the fact that String \\"theories\\" assume a particular Space-Time background rather than attempt to explain the emergence of Space-Time from a deeper quantum reality means that background-dependent string \\"theories\\" cannot be the final or ultimate theories.  <br />Smolin refers to \\"seers\\" and \\"craftspeople\\" in regard to the philosophically-minded questioners and the glorified technicians of mainstream science. Smolin, now free to work on the foundations of QT at a new institute funded by a wealthy patron, lists the philosophically-minded founders of QT such as Bohr, Heisenberg and Schrodinger amongst his heroes. However, unlike them he remains a realist assuming that physical theories can actually apprehend Reality as it is. As part of the philosophical questioning necessary to re-examine near-universal assumptions, Smolin fails to recognise the errors in Galileo's notion of primary and secondary qualities. As Schrodinger and Husserl etc. recognised, primary measurable qualities actually presuppose a conscious observer to determine them. Thus Galileo began the \\"despiritualization\\" of Nature by abstraction of measurable quantities.  <br />Whereas Smolin points to the Cartesian representation of Time as a frozen dimension as possibly the big mistaken assumption of physics, the likes of Heisenberg and Schrodinger were far more philosophically profound than would-be \\"seer\\" Smolin. So too was David Bohm whom Smolin's greatest hero Einstein befriended at Princeton. Smolin would do well to ask why Schrodinger was an advocate of Vedanta (Brahmanism), why Heisenberg said that Indian philosophy subconsciously influenced his physics ideas, why Bohm was a friend of Krishnamurti, and Pauli with Carl Jung. As Heisenberg said, it came as a great help to him to discover than an entire civilisation already subscribed to a view that resembled that of the new Quantum Mechanics which had so shocked the Western Mind (from Capra: Uncommon Wisdom). Heisenberg even checked the chapter on QM in \\"The Philosophy of Space and Time and the Inner Constitution of Nature\\" by mathematical physicist and Sanskrit-literate mystic Michael Whiteman in which Whiteman argued for a Universal Consciousness. All these mathematical theories simply explore the realm of possibilities or archetypes well known to mystics. The true Reality lies beyond such ideational realms in the distinctionless Ground of Universal Consciousness whose energetic vibrations manifest the phenomenal universe. Physics cannot even account for the most basic fact of our existence, our consciousness!  <br />Sutapas Bhattacharya <br />
B00005JPLU|5.0|Certainly this movie has its merits regarding the depiction of ancient Spartans' ethos and war prowess. The development of the story is good, the battle scenes really terrific and the tactics used by the Spartan phalanx are well depicted, but there are some oddities which I must admitt serve as a spice for this film. The monsters in Xerxes camp, the disfigured Ephialtes (who was not a Spartan but a local traitor), the mask-wearing Immortals with inhuman faces, the monster-like Spartan ephors (in fact they were common people elected for a year's term through vote, and not disfigured dropouts of society) and the improbably tall king Xerxes could have been avoided if the director wanted to follow the real historical events more strictly. I agree that the costumes of the Persian envoys thrown into the well, are more relevant to the appearance of the Immortals than the costumes they have in the film but the real purpose behind these oddities is probably to terrify the modern viewer and place him in Spartans' shoes, making him/her feel the real terror and excitement of battle. The film uses some famous historical phrases said by Spartans men and women (as Herodotus and other historians reproduced them) but also takes some liberties regarding certain details. Two of them: Leonidas should have been around 60 at the time of the battle of Thermopylae and not so young as the film implies, and also the capital letter Lamda was not in standard use on Spartan shiels during this period but after the 4th century BC. Also I was a little bit annoyed that historical names or phrases were spelled in English rather than the original Greek. Thus Thermopylae became Hot Gates, Leonidas' name was misspelled and the famous laconic reply \\"Molon Lave\\" was just \\"Come and get them!\\".

All the made up words and flashbacks just through me into a tizzy. However, as a fan with unconditional love, I will keep reading his works.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|Over three decades after the theatrical release of the original ROCKY in December 1976,the retired Rocky Balboa(Sylvester Stallone) steps into the ring one last time for old times' sake. He's probably fighting a new,much younger opponent. Instead of Rocky VI,this film was instead entitled ROCKY BALBOA. I'm sure there will be at least one more sequel. Rocky could train and manage a younger boxer. As all of Stallone's fans know,he no longer carries as much energy as he did three decades ago(Stallone is currently 60 years old). Since the original ROCKY,Stallone's fans loved him in other memorable favorites like OSCAR,TANGO & CASH,RHINESTONE,NIGHTHAWKS,OVER THE TOP,the RAMBO series,his several-second cameo in STAYING ALIVE which he directed(during the opening credits),and of course the five ROCKY sequels.

B000002JAX|5.0|Dreamland was the well-received debut CD from Madeleine Peyroux, who channels Billie Holliday like there's no tomorrow. Peyroux, a Georgia native who spends most of her time busking in Paris, shares not only a voice eerily similar to Holliday's, but also captures many of Lady Day's intangibles - the ability to sound like life has just slapped her silly whil simultaneously turning the other cheek, inflecting even the happiest song with more than a tinge of melancholy, and the ability to seem dated in a way that makes her very accessible and intriguing.<br /><br />Songs like I'm Going To Sit Right Down, Walking After Midnight, and the title cut show that she's a lot more than a rank imitator, but someone who's listen to Holliday so much that she not only sings her, she understand the pathos and the pain behind the vocals. Hopefully, Peyroux's life will have a much happier ending. Dreamland is a fantastic way to start a recording career.

B00003CXAW|5.0|PLOT: The film begins in New York City in 1933, during the bottom of the Great Depression. Filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) has charted a freighter boat called Venture to take him to a filming location somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Denham is most well-known for making adventure films in exotic locations. He is keeping many of the details about the trip very secret. His backing studio announces that they refuse to get him a leading lady for his film without more details about the film itself, so Denham goes out to find a girl on his own. On the streets, Denham finds a poor, starving girl (Fay Wray) caught trying to steal an apple. The girl is very beautiful and Denham just knows that she is right for the part. He buys the girl a meal and introduces himself to her. Her name is Ann Darrow and she happens to have some acting experience. He offers her the film role and the chance of a lifetime. Ann is apprehensive at first, but finally agrees to it. Denham and his film crew finally set sail on the Venture. For weeks they sail towards Indonesia; Denham promises to tell Captain Englehorn (Frank Reicher) their true destination once they get close enough. The first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), is a real tough guy who feels that the ship is no place for women, but he soon finds himself falling in love with Ann. Denham finally tells Englehorn that they are sailing towards a place called Skull Island. It is only charted on a map which was sold to him by a Norwegian captain in Singapore; the location of the island was given to the captain by a native who was swept out to sea. Denham tells eveyone that there is a wall on the island that is so large and so old that the natives there don't even remember who built it. Apparently it was built to keep something out from the other side; legend says that it is a monstrous creatures simply known as \\"Kong\\". The ship eventually enters through a thick fog which hides the island on the other side. The film crew comes to shore on the island's penninsula, which is the only place on the island not surrounded by rock. They begin to spy on some natives who are having some sort of ritual. Many of the men are dancing around dressed as gorillas and yelling, \\"Kong! Kong!\\" The natives are also adorning a young girl with flowers and jewelry. The native chief spots the film crew, so they decide to show themselves. Engelhorn is able to understand the native language and acts as an interpreter for both groups. When asked what they are doing, the chief explains that they are offering a wife to their god Kong. Suddenly the chief gets a look at Ann, whom he thinks is a much better choice for Kong's bride than their own native bride. He offers the film crew six native girls in exchange for Ann, but they refuse. The chief becomes angry and tells them to leave. Later that night on the Venture, Jack and Ann openly express their love for one another. Jack is called to the bridge and Ann is left alone. Suddenly, Ann is kidnapped by a group of natives that canoed to the Venture. The crew later find a native bracelet on the deck and realize that Ann was kidnapped. Back on the island, the natives open up the gate at the wall and leave Ann on the other side. They hit a large gong to summon the mighty Kong. Kong finally emerges from out of the jungle and reveals himself to be a giant gorilla. He grabs ahold of Ann and proceeds back into the jungle. The film crew then get to the wall and take control of it from the natives. A small group of them decide to go off into the jungle and rescue Ann. What they don't realize is that they are about to enter a world filled with prehistoric beasts which were thought to be extinct long ago.<br /><br />COMMENTS: King Kong has to be one of the greatest films of all time. It's astounding special effects must have blown the 1933 audiences away. Despite the fact that it was made during the Great Depression, it still attracted a huge audience. Unlike other horror films at the time, it was not based on a novel; it was a pure invention of hollywood. It was the first hit film to feature a life-like animated central character in any form, thanks to stop-motion master Willis O'Brien. Kong was created through the use of two stop-motion puppets (an 18\\" and a 24\\"), a life-size mechanical bust for Kong's close-ups, and a life-size mechanical arm for close-ups of Kong holding Ann in the palm of his hand. The combination proved to be extremely effective. O'Brien had previously used his stop-motion techniques to create the dinosaurs in The Lost World (1925). Next, he was hired to create the dinosaurs for the film Creation (1931), but the film was never finished. Many of the dinosaurs from the production were later used for King Kong. Many of the scenes in this one film alone are considered to be some of the most memorable in cinematic history, especially the scene of Kong atop the Empire State Building as airplanes are shooting at him. King Kong ultimately spawned several sequels, spin-offs, remakes, and rip-offs. Since the film was such a huge hit, RKO Pictures quickly filmed and released a sequel, Son of Kong, that same year. The premise of that film was that Carl Denham returns to Skull Island and discovers that Kong had an albino son. In 1949, a spin-off called Mighty Joe Young was released. This film told the story of a young girl named Jill Young who adopts a baby gorilla whom she names Joe. Joe later grows to a very large size (not as large as Kong, but larger than an average gorilla.) Joe is later brought to the U.S. to be the star of a Hollywood nightclub act. Joe was also created via stop-motion by Willis O'Brien. The film was later remade by Walt Disney Pictures in 1998. In 1962, the Japanese-based Toho Studios, who had created the giant radioactive monster Godzilla, obtained the rights to make a King Kong film. They decided to place Kong against their own creation Godzilla in the classic monster movie showdown King Kong vs. Godzilla. The film served as both a sequel to Son of Kong and Godzilla Raids Again (1955). This was the first movie where both of the monsters were seen in color. Rather than using stop-motion animation, Kong was brought to life using the popular Japanese form of suitmation known as \\"kaiju\\". Many Kong fans noticed that Kong is much larger in this film than in the original 1933 film. This was because Godzilla was actually much larger than the 1933 King Kong. Toho Studios decided to scale Kong up to Godzilla's size to make the fight more fair. The film's explanation for this was that Kong ate berries which contained growth hormones. Kong next appeared in the Toho produced King Kong Escapes (1967), which pitted Kong against Mechani-Kong (a robot version of himself). In 1976, Italian film mogul Dino De Laurentiis decided to produce a big budget remake of King Kong. Kong was brought to life through suitmation. The detailed suit was created by special make-up effects master Rick Baker (who also actually played Kong). The film had several major changes from the original film. It received mixed reviews from fans and critics alike, but depite all that it was commericially successful. The De Laurentiis remake was followed by a sequel, King Kong Lives, in 1986. The film was a commercial flop and is regarded by fans as the \\"worst King Kong movie of all time.\\" King Kong was remade again in 2005 by New Zealand director Peter Jackson, who also directed the highly succussful Lord Of The Rings (2001 - 2003). Jackson stated that the original film was what inspired him to be a film director. This time, Kong was created through a highly evolved CGI process in which sensors are placed all over an actor's body to create the movements. The actor picked to portray Kong through this process was Andy Serkis, who also portrayed the CGI-created character Gollum in the Lord Of The Rings films. The film was extremely faithful to the original and it became a mega-hit. This DVD presents the film in its original fullscreen ratio. The footage and audio have been completely digitally remastered.

B000HIVOI2|2.0|I love this move. I have been a fan of it since it was in the theaters. I jumped on the chance to own the high def version on Blu-ray. Anyone who has watched this movie before knows how much dialog in needs to be translated through subtitles during the movie. The problem with this disk is that the disk doesn't force any subtitles leaving the dialog completely untranslated. Even if you have seen the movie, and know what they are saying it is a huge problem. Tried to contact Lion's gate about the problem but they appear to be unwilling to even offer up a real e-mail address and they stopped answering their phones. Unless you can live with this problem do not buy this item.

Global warming seems to draw out complex reactions from all of us.  So, you can watch this documentary and believe it whole-heartedly or with a grain of salt.<br /><br />*An Inconvenient Truth* is basically Al Gore's presentation on global warming.  You really are watching a lecture accompanied with PowerPoint presentations.  You'll be shown statistics and pictures of the Earth and environments of the last few years, decades and ice ages.  You'll also be shown estimated/projected statistics for the next 50 years.  These facts and statistics aren't pretty or something to laugh at.  In fact, they should make you sit up and be alarmed.<br /><br />I learned something about Al Gore.  He is really informed and passionate about environmental issues.  He can explain these facts and statistics in laymen terms.  When you can actually understand what he is conveying to you, you can do nothing but be blown away.<br /><br />All you have to do is look back at what has been happening within the last 5 years on Earth.  Record-breaking temperatures are soaring.  Heat waves with people dying. Increased number of hurricanes, flooding, drought and other \\"acts of God\\".  Animal and plant species are fading away to extinction.  You just cannot ignore these things but be alarmed.  The question is, what are you gonna do about it?  For those of you who deny or ignore the fact that there is global warming, perhaps it is an inconvenient truth for you.  Wake up!<br /><br />So, maybe you can't do everything.  However, if you just do your part in your own home, car and neighborhood...you will indeed make a difference.  And if everyone else does their parts, the combined results will indeed make significant differences.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />*An Inconvenient Truth* is a wake-up call that the Earth is in crisis.  Listen with an open mind and heart.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|My grandfather is a gigantic James Bond fan, he has seen every film, knows which bonds fit the bond role and which ones don't. After 20 films and forcing me to watch them all for most of the beginning of my life he thinks Daniel Craig was a good pick to carry the Bond torch. I agree with my grandfather because Craig kills this role and makes a great first impression with his first Bond film. Casino Royale, which many may already know, was the first novel of the Bond series from the 007 creator Ian Fleming. It is also the first Bond film since The Living Daylights to take its name from a Flemming Novel.<br /><br />The film starts with a no license Bond and it's not his driver's license. James must kill 2 people before he can receive the double-0 and a license to kill. James sets out on his first mission as a 007 after completing 2 kills, which takes him to the world's terrorist banker Le Chiffre who is a very nasty man with a scarred face that has a huge addiction to gamble. In order to stop Chiffre James must beat him in a poker game, which certainly isn't cheap to stop the terrorists network. He is given some help from who else but his first Bond girl Vesper Lynd played by Eva Green but can she give him the help he really needs to stay alive.<br /><br />This film is very crisp; everything is perfect from the cinematography to the writing and pacing. A problem I always had with the James Bond films was that they seemed too long with prolonged over the top action scenes. On some occasions I might have had to watch a James Bond film twice to get everything that happened. I am surely not trying to knock the series cause the films were great but they also had flaws. I don't think that Daniel Craig is the best Bond though he was good but he lucked up by getting a great writing team and director that had fresh ideas and made significant changes.<br /><br />Having Martin Campbell directing was a great idea because he did a great job with GoldenEye but still brought some fresh ideas to this film. The action was perfect because it was very believable and Craig did well with his choreography and stunts. I feel that the film needed to focus a little more on the hand-to-hand fighting scenes than excessive mobile chases with gadgets going crazy blowing everything to bits.<br /><br />On the acting side of the film I think they did a good job casting. I wasn't a real big fan of Eva Green in Kingdom of Heaven but she did an ok job in this film. This was an overall great film because it was very realistic and believable. It took the good from all of the Bond movies before it and added more good to it than bad plus Daniel Craig is a good successor to Pierce Brosnan.

B000IJ79UW|5.0|The theatrical version of Richard Donner's Superman still holds up as the cinema's best superhero movie despite three decades' worth of advances in special effects and the arrival of almost every other comic book hero on the big screen, largely because at heart it's more a movie about what it means to be in a position where you have the power to do anything except what you really want. Although it's not without humor - it's dotted with neat little in-jokes that compliment rather than swamp the film, like Clark's brief glance at a payphone that's definitely not fit for his use - it takes itself and its characters seriously, with the absolute belief and integrity that Christopher Reeve brings to the part managing to transcend the inherent ridiculousness of a flying man who wears his underpants outside his tights. Marlon Brando's dignified performance sets the tone perfectly - this is indeed no mere fantasy, but something that carries some real emotional weight, with Kal El's journey to becoming Clark Kent and Superman one of loss and powerlessness despite his abilities. Yet rather than burying the picture the way the relentless one-note gloominess of Bryan Singer's take on the character did in Superman Returns, Donner mixes a classic epic style of filmmaking with a sense of joy and exuberance that makes the film seem a lot shorter than its 143-minutes, and throws in one of the great action setpieces of all time in the helicopter rescue sequence. Great filmmaking and great fun too.  <br /> <br />Also included on the 4-disc set is Donner's slightly longer director's cut and a wide variety of excellent extras including all the extras from the previously released double-sided Director's Cut edition as well as nine of the classic Max and Dave Fleischer Superman cartoons from the 1940s. However, be warned that some early copies of the theatrical version didn't include the original 1978 sound mix but featured a remastered track with additional sound effects. <br />

After all, rank imitators never past the test of time, but artists who can build on similarities and continue to experiement can last a very long time. Madeleine Peyroux is definitely not a rank imitator or a rank amateur. She has the goods and delivers them on Careless Love.
B00005JPLU|5.0|A grand violent artful epic war story that will rank with Braveheart and Gladiator.  This is the Frank Millerized version of the great Greek tragedy, with a modern message of freedom grafted on top.  The violence is immense and dramatic.  The ageless clash of civilizations is dramatized in the Greek/Persian conflict.  Is Frank Miller making an editorial on the War on Terror as well? <br /> <br />It's a fascinating movie.  The violence is part of the story of a culture of warriors.  Sure it's excessive, but that's part of the story.  Perhaps the biggest complaint is a DVD can not do the movie justice - it is best seen in a theater, ideally an IMAX.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|As one of the only 12 people who was genuinely delighted at Daniel Craig's casting a year ago, I must admit I was more than a little worried about Casino Royale. Not the kind of paranoia that those newcomers who'd never experience the changing of the guard the series goes through every decade or the staggeringly venomous hate-mongering of the more fanatical Brosnan fans who felt compelled to start libellous hate-sites, though. After all those months of arguing that he was the perfect choice for the role (especially after some of the more moronic suggestions), was I setting myself up for a fall if he turned in a disappointing performance? Similarly there was the film itself. While the producers were making all the right noises about going back to basics, they'd done exactly the same with Licence To Kill and chickened out to deliver a sub-Roger Moore effort with Wayne Newton as a comedy relief villain, inept ninjas, pointless gadgets, laughable violence and monster truck stunts. Too often in the past the franchise had been over-reliant on the goodwill generated by the earlier films, rehashing earlier vehicles to decreasing returns secure in the knowledge that the audience would turn up anyway. Take away the Bond brand, and too many post-OHMSS entries simply wouldn't have stood up to scrutiny in the marketplace on their own merits: Bond had become a tradition, a ritual like going home for the holidays that you knew was never going to be as good as it was when you were a kid but which you still went through out of a mixture of hope and obligation. <br /> <br />I needn't have worried. Not only is it the best Bond film in 37 years, it's as if the Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan years never happened. After Brosnan's surprisingly lazy and slightly seedy turn in DAD, Craig delivers the most physical Bond since Lazenby, but this time matched by the acting chops to make the most of the best script the series has had in decades - at once plot and character led - as the rookie blunt instrument bulldozes his way through his mission until emotional awakening and betrayal starts to finesse him into the Bond we knew from the Connery days. Brosnan never could have delivered this kind of performance, either physically or emotionally, and, truth be told, neither could Connery in his prime: Craig is the first one to convince you that he's not a movie star or an actor but that he really IS James Bond. <br /> <br />The updating of the plot from the Cold War era to a post 9/11 world works surprisingly well, with the first act managing to provide a convincing motive for the high stakes poker game centrepiece while also providing a couple of superb action scenes that don't become too absurd and serve the plot in a series where in the past the plot was too often an excuse for the action. The much-criticised change from baccarat to poker is a smart one too. Where Baccarat is purely a game of luck (as Fleming himself found out when he went bust in three hands trying out the novel's premise on a Nazi spy), poker actually involves both strategy and psychology, making for more satisfying drama and tension. <br /> <br />There is, sadly, one concession to gadgetry that veers into the absurd - c'mon, who keeps a defibrillator in their glove compartment? - and is an unwelcome reminder of the days when old Roge would get out of a scrape with his buzz saw wristwatch or his projectile dart cufflinks thanks to lazy writing, but elsewhere it settles for using existing technology (most of it manufactured by Sony for some reason that escapes me) rather than veering into total fantasy. And it's good to see a Bond who needs hospitalisation after the villain goes Quasimodo on his nuts with a bell rope. The film's final sequence promises one helluva follow-up, and one can only hope the producers don't lose their nerve and throw it all away the way they did with Diamonds Are Forever. The real James Bond is indeed back.  <br /> <br />Sadly, the DVD is a disappointment by thestandards of the previous EON entries - a couple of promotional documentaries, a revised version of the Bond Girls Are Forever TV show originally made for Die Another Day and a music video are your lot, meaning that down the line there will inevitable be a double-dipping 'Ultimate Edition.' Thankfully the film is more than good enough to make up for the lacklustre DVD.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|If you are expecting more of the same James Bond, be ready for a big surprise.  This movie is a totally different product from the Connery, Moore, Brosnan Bonds.  More violent, less subtle, no laughs.  Just hard core action. The plot is also a bit hard to follow - the relationship among the bad guys is at times obscure. The intro section is extremely violent and in black and white, so different from the mesmerizing intros to most Bond movies to the point where I thought I was watching a trailer for a different movie entirely. While Daniel Craig does a very credible job in the part of the almost rogue agent type character, I have never liked Judy Dench's portrayal of M, and once again I think she is a weakness here too.  And how can it be a real James Bond movie without Q, or R!  While there are a few gadgets, we miss out on the introductions! For my money I'd rather pull one of the Bond classics off the shelf and spend my time watching it instead.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|This film just doesn't feel like a Bond film.  I expect a mad villian bent on domination with his army of troops, fantastic gadgets, corny quips, larger-than-life action scenes, and a suave, womanizing Bond.  I loved the Brosnan Bond films and can't get used to somebody who looks like Craig as Bond.  I decided to check this one out anyway, with mixed feelings about it. <br /> <br />This film seems to be taking a cue from Batman Begins and re-inventing the character, starting at the beginning, with a little more believable storyline.  We know it's a Bond film and there is going to be plenty that is unrealistic.  Yet there were many elements that did seem more believable.  This Bond got his face scratched up.  He also wound up in the hospital.  There was none of the \\"leave the hero to die unattended in a creative trap\\" types of attempts on Bond's life.  His foes used guns, fists, swords, and poison.  The bad guys were merely people who helped finance terrorists, not meglamaniacs. <br /> <br />I will give the movie points for being more realistic, yet I'm not sure that's what I want in a Bond flick.  A Bond flick, like a super-hero flick is escapism.  I want to watch a hero that can do all of these fantastic things that the average guy can't.  This Bond is still that, but he was a bit more vunerable.  His challenges weren't up to what we've seen in previous Bonds either. <br /> <br />Aside from Bond himself, the movie itself was mostly uneventful.  There was a nice chase scene in the beginning and a big \\"knock the house down\\" battle at the end, but the rest of the movie was a bit on the dull side. <br /> <br />The seeming pinnacle of the movie is defeating the villian in a card game.  Sorry, but I can't stand to watch people playing cards on TV, much less in an action flick.  Then, when you think it's over, and the villian is killed, it keeps going for about 40 minutes more, where you think it's over at several points, but then something else happens.  It came off veryawkwardly. <br /> <br />During these 40 minutes, Bond falls in love, quits his job and begins living the happy life, touring the world with the latest Bond girl, Vesper.  (How un-Bond-like)  The musical score tells us everything is just perfect and it keeps dragging on.  It's overdone.  It's too perfect, we know this is either a dream or something's going to happen, just get on with it.  The later is the case.  We are led to believe Vesper has betrayed him and has been working with the bad guys. <br /> <br />During the last major action scene, a Venitian house is destroyed while Bond fights the bad guys.  I know the movie's ending (finally, I hope), so I know these guys aren't going to get too far.  But I have no emotional attatchment to any of them, making the whole scene unfulfilling.  Vesper has just betrayed him, so I don't care whether she lives or dies and it's a bit ambiguous whether he's trying to save her or kill her.  The bad guys are fairly new to the movie and I have no emotional attachment to them.  I haven't watched them elude Bond through the whole flick and am now cheering for them to meet their end.  And I know they're not going to escape and figure into the plot later because this is the end.  I don't really care.  It's a fairly predictable outcome. <br /> <br />I suppose if you like a more realistic Bond, this might be for you.  Or if a more muscular Bond is your thing, this is the movie for you.  Overall, I was unsatisfied.  Much more so with the plot and pace than the new Bond, but I still can't see Craig as Bond. <br />

B000IJ79WU|4.0|Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut isn't a perfect film by any means, but it's a huge improvement over the Richard Lester theatrical version, which I found almost completely lacking in soul and filled with incredibly awkward shifts in tone - indeed, Lester's determination to abandon the verisimilitude that was Donner's watchword and turn the whole thing into a cheap custard pie comedy showed how little he cared for the material. As with Superman III, where he had more of a free hand, he seemed more interested in an Adam West-style slapstick spoof than anything else.     Although some have compared it to a rough cut, despite Donner only finishing about 70% of the film, the reconstruction is a lot smoother than expected. Aside from the awkward 'Last week on Superman' opening which goes on forever, it doesn't look bad at all - even the screen test used for one key sequence is shot in full costume on a fully dressed set, and is more competently executed than many of Lester's scenes. Using the first film's turning back the Earth plot device yet again is awkward and the effects reintegrating the unused Brando scenes aren't always as smooth as they might be, but it never looks particularly unfinished. If anything I found the editing much more disjointed in Lester's cut, where the additions were painfully noticeable - not just the different film stock or change in tone but the fact that everyone suddenly looked so much older in the reshot footage.     Although the film is now a lot tighter, the first half is still awkward - too much Gene Hackman, too little conquering the Earth (gee but the President rolls over easy: fry a few rednecks and knock over a single Washington monument and he'll give you the keys to the planet). It still has too much of that atrocious audio manipulation of Terence Stamp's voice that makes him sound like a bad drag act as well (and this a decade before he became Priscilla). But once the second half hits its stride, it's a massive improvement. While the early Brando scenes are purely functional, there's some real emotional power in his final scene, and with all the infantile cutaways to badly-executed slapstick comic cutaways to people getting ice creams in the face or the like removed, the battle in Metropolis finally works and even takes on an apocalyptic dimension entirely absent in Lester's isn't-this-childish-crap-really? approach to the scene.     The end is a little disappointing, but still perhaps more convincing than the kiss ending in Lester's cut. Most importantly the film finally has the soul that Lester chewed out and threw away. It still would have been a disappointing sequel had Donner been able to finish and tighten it, but compared to the piece of utter junk Lester delivered (and I really do think his version is appalling and was horrendously disappointed when it opened) it's a much more satisfying number. I'm glad to see something finally approaching a decent film.     Extras aren't extensive - some deleted scenes shot by Donner (but none from Lester's cut), mostly featuring redundant scenes with Gene Hackman, an introduction by Donner, restoration featurette and commentary.
B000M341QE|5.0|I was a little lost at the end after seeing it at the theater, but watching it on DVD cleared up all my confusion. There's a lot of detail which can be a bit tricky the 1st time around. Having said that, it really is an excellent and engrossing and entertaining movie. All the actors did a great job - especially Leo & Damon. I usually can't stand Nicholson's hambone emoting but he was good in this part. His character was a composite of gang bosses Whitey Bulger, Jimmy Coonan and Joe Massino. Like I said, all the plot twists & turns & the details were somewhat hard to follow at 1st, but watch it again & it all makes perfect sense.

0743289412|5.0|Premise: Two years after the death of her husband, Lisey is finally getting around to cleaning out the converted barn where he spent so much of his time creating books and short stories. Yet as she begins this ardous task, Lisey runs into a couple of problems - resurfacing memories of things she thought she would never have to remember again, and a man who has taken it upon himself to threaten her on behalf of an educator wanting to get a hold of her husbands papers.<br /><br />Review: I totally loved this book! Though a lot of it has to do with the fact that Stephen King has put in a lot of stuff in this one for others of the craft. Don't get me wrong though, despite the fact I found a subcurrent to add way more enjoyment and content for me(as an author), it is still a great read for anyone else too. He does his usual evil hints that keep you going as you get flashes of what will be coming and feeding you just enough to wet the appetite. Also loved how he structured the time element to demonstrate the concept of pool time (time being like ripples on a pond) rather than time being a liner thing. Up to one point you have 3 points in time all tied/affecting each other. Very nicely done. (Also loved his kuddos to his editor at the end.  It is nice to know that Mr. King does appreciate their efforts, as I most certainly do as well for those who edit my work.)
B000J10ERO|2.0|It would be tempting to dismiss Superman Returns with a cursory he shouldn't have bothered. Certainly for all the noble intentions it's the most misconceived blockbuster in years, at times misjudging its audience more than any mega-budget film since Speed 2. On paper it sounds so promising - ignoring the last two Superman films and following on from Superman II as if they never happened, throwing Marlon Brando back in the mix via archive footage and bringing the Man of Steel back to Earth after an absence of several years during which people have begun to question whether they even need him anymore. And after Bryan Singer's success with the first two X-Men films, he'd seem the perfect director. Yet the end result is one of the most disappointingly dull and relentlessly glum movies of the century, and certainly one of the grottiest looking major studio films ever. It's at once one of those films that manages to look both expensive and cheap. You can see where money has been spent, but it never really counts. If anything it looks like a busted, bloated miniseries, all buildup but precious little payoff. What we get instead is endless brooding.  <br /> <br />Yet the relentlessly oppressive look of the film is merely a symptom of a far greater malaise. Where Donner mixed sorrow with joy and exuberance, Singer just gives us naval gazing as his Superman spends far more of the movie brooding, brooding and then brooding some more, not even finding any satisfaction in the few feats of heroism he performs. Indeed, they should have changed the tagline to 'You'll believe a man can brood' as he mopes his way through much of the agonisingly long 154 very long minutes. He hardly even flies - he just hovers around wallowing in wistful self-pity forever before we finally get half an hour of decent action before its back to the misery (albeit somewhat more effective than the dreary first half).  <br /> <br />The film is often genuinely monotonous in the dictionary sense of the word.There's no sense of pace or narrative economy, no joy of discovery, no eagerness to see what happens next, just an unexciting trudge through the superhero's angst as he endlessly hovers around. Worse, this is a film with no sense of wonder at all.  <br /> <br />Where the Donner films worked was their ability to juggle loss, emotion, a sense of wonder and joy and exuberance - with Reeve you got the impression that Superman enjoyed using his powers to do good, but here it's nothing but a cross to bear in a series of even-more-bleedin'-obvious-than-The-Passion-of-the-Christ metaphors. Look, there's Supes being crucified; look, there's Supes being scourged; and look - on the Third day the tomb is empty and he has risen!  <br /> <br />Yet for all the time spent on would-be character building scenes, even by the half hour point we know surprisingly little and care less about the characters, so that when Superman finally goes into action in a well-conceived but strangely unexciting shuttle rescue it carries no real weight. Only Kevin Spacey seems to be bringing anything to the party, his Lex Luthor dominating the film far more than should be good for it as he sets about his latest real estate scam at great length. On the side of good, Brandon Routh fares better as Clark Kent than as Superman, his weak voice combining with a poor sound mix to make the Man of Steel sound distinctly wimpier than the mild-mannered reporter. Kate Bosworth does her best with Lois Lane, but the character goes through the film with such a huge chip on her shoulder it's impossible to warm to her despite her best efforts. Hell, you know a film's in trouble when James Marsden makes the most impression!  <br /> <br />And it all looks so grotty all the time, with the limitations of the video photography robbing even close-ups of detail (some shots of Superman's face look more like a Final Fantasy computer simulation than a real person), limiting the color scheme (Superman's costume usually looks turquoise or green here) and seemingly limiting the action to clumsy tight shots that limit the film's scale. Even basic no-brainer shots are simply botched - hard to believe but even the would-be iconic shot of Clark ripping off his shirt to reveal - well, just a little bit of blue vest actually - flops because the shot misses the iconic `S' logo entirely as if the film was framed for fullframe TV instead of widescreen.  <br /> <br />Nor are the well-intentioned nods to the Donner films successful. The Brando footage, after the first scene, seem more gimmick than anything else, with lines thrown in almost at random to no effect whatsoever. It even rehashes huge chunks of other characters' dialogue from the first film, showing up just how short some of the players fall (Routh seems almost apologetic when delivering the `flying is still statistically speaking the safest way to travel' bit while Parker Posey does her best with Valerie Perrine's cast-off wisecracks).  <br /> <br />Although they're talking about adding more action for the proposed sequel, that's really not the solution - the 1978 film probably had less action than this, but it counted because we were involved with and liked the characters: you wanted him to rescue Lois from the helicopter, whereas this time round you couldn't care less if the surly cow burned up in the shuttle scene or not (as an introduction to her as well it's incredibly poor). What this needs is characters we like and can root for, not bigger set pieces. As it stands, Hell, even Fantastic Four was a more successful superhero flick than this. It's as if someone decided to film Lois Lane's editorial `Why the World Doesn't Need Superman.' Looks like Supe's fatal flaw isn't Kryptonite, it's Bryan Singer. Still, it could have been worse: it could have been Brett Ratner...  <br /> <br />The extras on the 2-disc set are good and at least highlight the sincere intentions behind this misfire but it's hard to muster up the enthusiasm to watch them throughout after seeing the film, especially since the expensive Krypton prolog is NOT included in the deleted scenes, being held back for a future special edition in what seems a particularly cynically commercial move. The transfer of the feature is okay, but the limitations of the original digital photography are often very apparent, meaning that it frequently looks worse than the first two films made more than a quarter of a century ago!

B00008DDSC|5.0|My first viewing of the campy film Secretary could not have been more ironic because I had been working as a secretary -- ahem, assistant -- for a solo practitioner for only two months. I recall leaving the theater feeling empowered despite knowing that the next day I would have to fetch whatever my boss wanted, when he wanted it. There are bosses, not just the lawyers, who long for the old-fashioned secretary.<br /><br />Bravo to the filmmaker for rendering Secretary's unflinching revelations about emotional pain as unsettling as its erotic depictions of the catharsis of that pain. I found, and still find, the film to be a surreal and vicarious pleasure. Not that what ensues between the boss and assistant in Secretary is unrealistic. Perhaps you know of a solo proprietor whose temp secretaries kept quitting but who now has a full-time assistant. Why is that assistant a perfect match?<br /><br />Intellectually, I admire the filmmaker's courage in commenting poetically upon the ways in which American society conditions women to be passive and to devalue themselves. Leave it to an art/indie film to expose how some (or many?) American women find themselves either stuck in a time warp of adolescent vanity or suffering through existential paralysis. Because American women are taught to identify and value themselves through their relationships with men, it is a total thrill in Secretary to watch the script flip the stereotype of the skirt-chasing boss on its head.<br /><br />In terms of casting, I cannot imagine anyone but Maggie Gyllenhaal in the title role. Her secretary is like the repressed alter ego of Elizabeth Taylor's Maggie the Cat on that hot tin roof -- full of angst but no less smoldering. Maggie G. appears to purr rather than speak. James Spader, who once upon a time seemed typecast as a snooty yuppie, gets the chance in Secretary to fully realize his erotic potential. While his character can be viewed as tongue-in-cheek, he delivers a genuinely quirky and sensitive performance.<br /><br />When you get down to it, the various vicarious experiences in Secretary will please some and repulse others.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This was a horrible movie, not just because of the numerous hisorical inaccuracies, but because of the wooden, bimbo-ish acting of Kiera Knightley. I do not understand why the director chose to make the Bennetts out to be paupers. A family of such low status would NEVER have mixed with higher society such as the Bingleys or Darcys. Also, Englishmen of the time would NOT have appreciated the common, casual manners of the actors. There is one scene of Keira Knightley flopping on a couch,and while watching it I just wanted to cry. Also, in the book, Jane was the prettiest of the Bennett girls, while in the movie she looks kind of freakish. I think this is a sad example of politically correct re-writing of history to remove the sense of class differences. The dinner free for all was a total joke. Anyone even remotely familiar with proper English manners would understand that if a family ate like that they would have been on the VERY bottom rungs of society. Mr. Darcy as portrayed in this movie looks continually like he's in need of a hug, and is not the proud character that Firth so brilliantly brought to life in the BBC version. The idea of pigs and dogs running throughout the house, of the Bennetts not owning a carriage was absurd. Don't get me wrong, I could see how a modernization of this story could be quite well done, but this ain't it.
B000BH4YFE|5.0|This one of my favorite T. Rex albums.  I never get tired of this material.  I have been listening to this album for over 30 years now and it's still rocks!  This two disc set is just great.  I love everything about it.  The packaging, the essay about the album, but most of all, the music.  Bolan was on a roll.  The sound on this is the best yet, I had second thoughts about buying this for the third time, but I am glad I did. The sound beats any of the previous issues of this album.  The first CD I bought of this album in 1986, made in France, had more bonus tracks, these were singles issued around the same time as the album.  Fortunately these are on The Wax Singles, A's & B's 1972-77, so I haven't missed any of this great material.  The second disc titled \\"Rabbit Fighter\\" is a very nice compliment to the album.  Almost the entire album in alternate takes and mixes.  This and \\"Electric Warrior\\" are two of the best of all time.  A must have, especially for T. Rex fans.
0060555661|5.0|What's really amazing in reading this book is seeing how the same scams and bad business practices that Graham complained about and warned against are still very common today.  I've been investing for a few years now and it just amazes me every time I see Graham describe a situation in his book and I recognize it from personal experience.  The commentary by Mr. Zwieg is also very interesting.  Probably the best benefit of this book is that it teaches you how to not loose money, or how to at least minimize those losses by adhering to general margins of safety.  It may sound strange, but knowing how to not loose money is what will make you money in the long run.

0142004235|5.0|I just finished East of Eden by John Steinbeck, one of the greatest American novelists. Though it wasn't this novel that inspired Bruce Springsteen to write his father trilogy (Adam raised a Cain, Independence Day and my Father's House) it might as well have been the similarities are startling, both between the author and the singer as between the novel and the songs. Both Springsteen and Steinbeck are autodidacts when it comes to social and religious matters, both have been known to weave that subject matter into their works. The most pronounced link between Springsteen and Steinbeck might be Grapes of Wrath but East of Eden shows that Bruce attraction to Steinbeck is far from coincidental. In short the novel deals with the heritage of sin. Steinbeck modeled his novel to Genesis and especially to the story of Cain and Abel.  The novel is a slow unraveling of a family drama over three generations, with the focus on the last two. It was his most ambitious yet controversial novel at the time. Although the novel works at various levels, the level of inter familiar relationships is where the relation to Springsteen's music strikes the clearest chord. <br /> <br />In the centre of the novel is the upbringing of Cal(eb) and A(a)ron, the twin \\"sons\\" of Adam Trask.  Their youth is plagued by the secret and sins of their parents. Unbeknownst to the twins their true father is Adam's brother Charles. Their mother, Kathy, they are told died at birth although in fact she rejected her marriage, her children and all that is good. Kathy ran of after giving birth to Salinas where she runs a brothel.  When the oldest born, Cal, finds out he's is burdened by this. Cal feels his mother's sin in his blood, experiences it as something he barely can escape. \\"In the darkness of your room, your mother calls you by your true name, You remember the faces, the places, the names, You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain, Adam raised a Cain\\" Springsteen sings; \\"You inherit the sins,you inherit the flames\\", the song continues. Both the novel and the song pose a question. Is sin something we inherit out of the pain of our parents, is it in our blood, can we possibly escape the trappings our parent set for us. <br /> <br />In the novel the question around the heritage of sin is discussed in length. Ironically it takes a Chinese servant, Lee, to shed some light on the case. Almost as if Steinbeck wants to tell us we need a foreign view to understand ourselves, to show us our trappings, to be our mirror. Thought Steinbeck might also have wanted to stress the universality the heritage of sin. Anybody who's ever read close into the Bible already knows that it's not free of contradiction and mystery, some of it spurns from translation as not all Hebrew let's itself easily translated in other languages. Steinbeck shows us through Lee that the whole notion of heritage of sin might be as a result of clumsy translation. In the King James Bible God promises Cain he'll conquer sin, where as in the American standard Bible Cain is commanded to rule over sin. \\"Thou shalt rule\\" or \\"Do thou rule\\", two translations, a world of difference. Both seem to imply we inherit sin, but the way we conquer sin differs. In the first God takes away our sin, in the second He commands us to stay free of sin. In both cases man is left without will. It has been decided for him what sin is and that it must be conquered, the only difference is who does it. God or man himself by command. The translation drives from the Hebrew \\"Timshel\\", more purely translated \\"Thou mayest\\", implying a far more open question, leaving it open for man if he'll recognize sin and if he'll conquer sin. Steinbeck in East of Eden radically reinterprets the Bible giving us free will and choice, close to making God irrelevant. If we have free will and choice, if we can decide for ourselves independently, God is no longer all powerful. Not only that, it means we can shake ourselves free from our heritage. <br/> <br />This realisation is close to the understanding Springsteen reaches in Independence Day.  <br /> <br />\\"Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late <br />Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now <br />I'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's Gate <br />We wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow <br />Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us <br />There's a darkness in this town that's got us too <br />But they can't touch me now <br />And you can't touch me now <br />They ain't gonna do to me <br />What I watched them do to you\\" <br /> <br />In Independence Day is enclosed the realisation that the past cannot be chanced, it is something we carry with us and between us the rest of our (joint) lives. But Independence Day is also an affirmation of free will. In this song it seems that Springsteen no longer feels trapped in his heritage, he starts to make his own choices. The darkness can no longer touch him he exclaims and Springsteen decides on a different path as the one his father set out on or may have intended for him. The analogy is almost Biblical. Cast out of the Garden man set out on his own path making choices God neither intended nor wished for us but we have made with the free will installed in us. <br /> <br />With the unravelling of the novel Steinbeck starts to focus more and more on Cal and his relationship to his father. Steinbeck lets Cal play out a question that troubled him in the Bible. Why would God take preference over Abel's offer, does God have preferences, does he love some more than others. Steinbeck also shows our basic human need for recognition, our need to be accepted as full individuals by our parents as he lets the triangular relationship between Cal, Aron and Adam unravel. In the novel Aron develops as character that seems to meet Adam's wishes and desires. Adam sees in Aron the son he wanted, in Cal he seems to see the negative no matter how hard he tries, in his mind affirming the Sin hemust have inherited from his mother, affirming he's no good. Although Cal has declared his independence earlier in the novel, his hunger for recognition fails to die causing him to hate his brother and hurt him severely. When Cal asks for his father's forgiveness and acceptance on his dying bed Adam just says Timshel, he may give him that, leaving the question unresolved but also leaving the choice of acceptance and forgiveness with Cal. He is left to forgive himself, he is left to accept himself, he is left with his own choices for bad or good despite how his father may perceive him. <br /> <br />A same kind of sentiment seems to breathe from \\"My Father's House\\", the song where Springsteen revisits his Father, looking for some closure but finding none. \\"My father's house shines hard and bright it stands like a beacon calling me in the night, Calling and calling, so cold and alone, Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned\\" <br />
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This dvd is a must for anyone who has a Celtic Woman cd's. The proformance was nothing less then fantasic. So real you think you are there in the front row.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I am not a big Bond fan but with all of the talk about this movie I decided to pick it up and am glad I did.  I think the last reviewer may have gotten a lemon because this movie has beautiful picture and excellent sound.  Very intertaining and one of the better movies to come out in the past few years.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Obviously, this is just one of those films that by its very nature gets very different reactions running to the extremes. Any time you make some major changes to a long-running series (20 films!), some people are going to be happy and some people will be upset. So, if you are trying to gauge from the widely divergent things reported about this film what you're going to think, you are probably in for a hard time. Honestly, if you haven't seen it, you should probably just get it over with and judge for yourself. I think perhaps that the changes have been exaggerated and that, underneath it all, there's more continuity than the uproar would indicate. As everyone should agree, the facts are this: they hired a new blonde actor, reduced the reliance on implausible gadgets and outsized special effects, cut down on one-liners and outright comedy, and gave you a plot that didn't involve saving the world from destruction but rather focuses on trying to win at cards so as to bankrupt a financial backer of terrorism. The movie shows us Bond's two first kills and has him as newly promoted to double-0 status but is set in the present, which seems to cause some people continuity headaches (no Q, no Moneypenny in this one). The use of traditional Bond theme music is unusually minimized here but for a good reason, since this movie is sort of about Bond becoming Bond. There are fewer big action set pieces in this one than usual; some people seem not to like the opening chase sequence through a construction site, finding some of the stunts and choreography un-Bond like. Some have griped that the style of the action scenes would feel more at home in a film about Jason Bourne or John McClane than James Bond. While I enjoyed the action quite a lot myself, I can't say either criticism is off base: the airport sequence does feel quite Die Hard-like and the opening chase had tons of trendy parkour elements (a la B13 but more over the top). The movie runs almost 2 1/2 hours and has several quiet stretches which seem to have triggered impatience in some viewers.    But of course, the really major complaint goes: Daniel Craig is no (insert your favorite Bond actor or Clive Owen or whoever). (Just for the record, I am a Connery guy (favorite Thunderball) and thought Clive would be a fabulous Bond.) This is no small matter: If you just don't like Daniel Craig for some reason, you are just not going to like this film, since who plays Bond is pretty much everything. After all, had Connery been in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, I suspect a lot of people would say that was the best Bond ever made. Similarly, Dalton, a relatively decent actor, simply didn't cut it for me as Bond, lacking the necessary magnetism and charisma that Connery had established for the character, so those films are not among my favorites. Moore and Brosnan seem to be the preferred Bonds of viewers who prefer to use words like \\"suave\\" or \\"charming\\" to describe Bond: neither actor projected real physical prowess or a dangerous quality and their films tended therefore to accentuate the quips, the technology, and the unflappable sophistication of Bond as globe-trotting superspy. Craig has been characterized by a lot of reviewers as a return to the physicality that Connery brought and this is true. I think Craig successfully projects physical confidence and manly prowess in carrying himself similar to the way that Steve McQueen used to pull it off. And Craig's Bond gets sweaty, looks to be almost in tears from pain, gets bloodied and bruised, and seems genuinely capable of pounding someone in a fistfight. I think this is all to the better: these films are action adventure films after all and having a lead who is convincing on this score is a pretty good idea.      But I think not enough has been made of the use Casino Royale makes of Craig's acting ability. Having seen Layer Cake, I felt pretty optimistic about Craig's ability to carry a movie like this but I was surprised at how much I liked him in the part. Too often, Bond has been rather bland and dull because he has been, frankly, too good at what he does. But I was impressed in this film at how, by zeroing Bond out, by making Bond a relatively untested younger agent, DRAMA has returned to this series.  Craig's Bond is impetuous, arrogant, and occasionally foolish. It is remarkable how many poor decisions, how many unnecessary risks, how many misreads he makes in the course of this narrative if you look closely at how the action unfolds. And Craig is given the chance to display a far wider range of emotions and intensities than Bond has generally been allowed. In fact, Casino Royale, it seems to me, is really the first Bond FILM in quite some time; the character of Bond the person and the small particulars of the story matter, rather than what you are watching being merely a series of big budget stunts strung together.      Whereas some seem to feel the movie drags late or becomes boring after they move to Casino Royale, I thought the opposite; when the movie got smaller and began to focus on the character interactions, the movie got better. Many people have complained specifically about the poker scenes as being too long. I disagree: they show you only hands that actually establish something important for the storyline, and the fact that nothing blows up to me does not equate to dull. There is plenty of intrigue going on in the Casino during and between the cardplaying to keep it from getting boring. Mads Mikkelsen is much more subtle here that the typical lead Bond villain is asked to play it (see Pusher 2 for more of him) and I think his casting indicates that the makers of this film want to you watch the human interactions in this film more carefully, that the characters here were not intended to be simple caricatures. And the two Bond women in this film, while both pleasurable to the eye in typical fashion, project a human quality which strikes me as rarely achieved in the series; Eva Green's Vesper is much more successfully developed than the typical Bond girl. To be clear, a Bond film is and should probably continue to be a male fantasy throwback and this film, despite the repeat presence of Judi Dench as the boss M, is no p.c. creation simply for having somewhat more realistic women characters than usual. It's notable that unlike many contemporary action films, violence is in this film a completely male domain: there's no woman beating up or shooting a bunch of guys demonstrating equality through brutality. It's just that one-dimensional bad guys and one-dimensional gorgeous shapely women alike generally make for more boring movies than multi-dimensional bad guys and gorgeous shapely women.    I'm sure this film's detractors would simply disagree that the things I describe were successful for them and would say they still didn't like the movie, whatever it was trying to do, add drama and character or not. Despite my rating it 5 stars, I readily admit that the movie is not in any way flawless and I focus here only on the positives. And anyone who loved all the Brosnan films and has kept up their interest all these years could rightfully question why there was a need for the series to take a different approach. Which does sort of lead to the objection all the little objections add up to, which is, this movie doesn't really feel like a JAMES BOND movie to the people who dislike it. And those people certainly have every right to feel that way. But for me, this series has for a long time flirted with self-parody and camp, and I didn't feel much reason to see another installment in what was seeming increasingly routine and uninspired formulaic stuff; most of the recent Bonds didn't strike me as \\"fun\\" at all and I couldn't sustain enough interest to make it all the way through Die Another Day. I know several people, similarly burned out, who have seen this movie and been surprised at how much they liked it and these are, I think, the people the franchise is trying to win back. So for me, I haven't really felt like the movies in this series have been authentically \\"Bond\\" for quite some time, and I feel that this one is the most worthwhile one in ages. I worry a bit that the next one will start to move in the wrong direction without an original Fleming novel to ground it, with the pressure to restore some of the elements they stripped out of this one to please everyone. It might not work out. But for the meantime, this one has restored my faith in the series.
B0000TB050|5.0|A friend reccomened this DVD. I had to get it since I love U2. The feeling from the band and the audience is unforgettable. You can actually see mist coming down and the castle in the background. Larry Mullen's expressions and body language conveys how he feels. They are \\"home\\" in this video and like no other rock band in the world U2's message is seen and heard vividly.The entire band seems so happy and in perfect harmony. <br />And to think this was only about a week before 9/11. That makes it only more precious.
0385512058|5.0|Yes, the author does have a bit of an ego that can be somewhat annoying at times. But the advice in the book is very good. I've read many books about networking and this is one of the two best, along with \\"Dig Your Well Before You're Thirsty\\" by Harvey MacKay.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|Very satisfying purchase.  \\"Colour the Small One\\" has a simple, near-acoustic rock style which, along with Sia's vocals, are reminiscent of Dido's \\"Life for Rent\\" and include many jazz and blues overtones.  Guitar, brass instruments, synth organ, and even the xylophone are tastefully blended with both fast and slow percussion in amounts that are often quite complex, yet carefully avoid the \\"noise rock\\" effect.  Unlike Dido, the lyrical content avoids any edgy or potentially offensive territory, making this album safe for any casual listening audience.  Presently lingering near the top of my playlist rotation.
B00065MDRW|5.0|This is easily King Crimson's best CD. Even though it is there first album, their music explores all kinds of different genre's (i.g. Progressive rock, Jazz, and other's.). I highly recommend this album.
B000NA28IE|1.0|After watching this ridiculous, plodding and boring movie, you'll feel a compelling urge to wipe and flush. And I thought Narnia was a second-rate Lord of the Rings, but sadly, it puts Eragon to shame. Aside from the stellar CG work, you have top tier actors like John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons reciting third rate, cornball lines and acting like medieval hams from a Monty Python movie, scenes that rapidly jerk to and fro like a bad Goth music video, and young unknown actors that recite lines mechanically as if they graduated from the George Lucas school of acting. There is no continuity and no emotional build up to scenes, and worse, there is little direction in trying to tell even the least semblance of a semi-cohesive story. Stay far away from this vapid nugget of juvenile Fantasy tripe and check out Dragonheart if you're looking for a decent Fantasy movie about dragons.
B00064WSN2|4.0|This album is very similiar to their first album 'In The Court Of The Crimson King.' Robert Fripp wanted to and did prove that he could have written the first album, on his own.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I happened to see the movie Serenity a couple of months ago. And like so many other reviewers here, I fell in love with the crew of Serenity and just had to buy the Firefly DVD set.     <br /> <br />Firefly has the perfect blend of humor, memorable witty dialog, suspense and action.  I too enjoyed the themes of family and loyalty throughout the series. <br /> <br />It's a cryin' shame Firefly had to be cancelled so early because it was so fresh and original compared to most sci fi shows you see these days.
0786890754|1.0|I have not received any items from this order. If you would send them to me I would be glad to give you a review.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|One of the best things Plant has done...Plain and simple... Easily the best of any of his solo albums (and I have them all!!) and right up there with Zeppelin! I was skeptical even though I am a fan, but this cd put to rest any doubts I had. You can tell he's matured but still sounds fantastic!! I can only hope we get more albums like this soon because Im already on my second copy of this one!!!
B00006AW2O|2.0|Clever moniker aside (12 songs by 5 guys. Get it?), this is probably the weakest of the Rolling Stones' first five discs. The lack of a strong a-side hurts - the highlights of the early Stones' discs were ALWAYS the a-sides, and of course this one, their second, is no exception. Okay, so It's All Over Now was their first UK #1, and it's got a cool dramatic opening riff and catchy, singalong chorus. That said, I don't really listen to it that often. Time is On My Side is a classic, but it's the only one here, at least to me. And the organ-and-harmonica driven instrumental 2120 South Michigan Avenue is bluesy fun. Now for the rest...<br /><br />I'm sorry, but their cover of the Drifters' Under the Boardwalk is REALLY BAD. Nauseating, even. Ever hear their doo-wap haromines? No? Spare yourself. It's an absolute decable. The resident Chuck Berry cover, Around and Around, is on the boring side, as are the slew of other absolutely useless covers (Confessin' the Blues, If You Need Me, Suzie Q). And while some of the originals (Good Times, Bad Times, Congradulations) are unexpectedly folky, they're also quite dull. Others are more of the blues-rock that's the Stones' calling card (Empty Heart, Grown Up All Wrong). They too are quite dull.<br /><br />I can't really see why anybody but an obsessive collector would see in 12x5 - Time is on My Side and It's All Over Now can both be found on numerous compilations. I guess you CAN find the all-too-rare 2120 South Michigan Avenue. But the rest is useless.
1416914285|5.0|As a general rule, I do not care for fantasy writing. I have no interest in reading about far off worlds or dimensions that do not exist and have no bearing on the modern landscape. <br /> <br />So I was surprised when I found Ms. Clare's debut novel engaging and imaginitive without turning me off with the more fanciful elements of the work. The true reward in reading City of Bones is the way Ms. Clare weaves in New York City. Not famous New York, with nothing but landmarks, but the real gritty New York, from the alleys of Willamsburg to Nacho Mamas restaurant. Ms. Clare has captured the essence of good urban fiction. Like Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere did for London, City of Bones reveals a hidden facet to the New York we mundanes see daily. <br /> <br />Though Ms. Clare's characters are vibrant and imaginitive, the real star in this work in Ms. Clare's vision of New York. I highly recommend this novel to any looking for a new take on urban fiction.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|I am a Blues music lover and really enjoy Buddy's music collection.  <br /> <br />
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I love movies like \\"Babel\\". I love movies that make me think, that objectively portray the world we live in, both its good and bad sides. I love the movie that can make me cry without being pathetic. I love \\"Babel\\".<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" is a movie that features four parallel stories - the desperate attempts of an American tourist (Brad Pitt) to save his wounded wife during their stay in a foreign country, an initiation toa new culture of two young children by their nanny (Oscar-nominated Adriana Barazza), a coming-of-age story of two Moroccan brothers and the frustrating attepts of a mute girl (Oscar-nominated Koji Yakusho). Unlike \\"Crash\\", which focused on the cultures crashing against one another and resolving in an \\"uh-huh\\" moment of epiphany once the different stories have colided as well, \\"Babel\\" is more interested in the personal path of these people, as they represent their culture. In every story, there is a character-defining moment, a bombastic, yet silent portrayal of humanity that these people are desperately trying to embrace. This movie doesn't have a purpose or a final resolution, which may irritate some audiences, but that is not the point - it is a movie made for its own sake, creating art that doesn't need to be justified. And art it is, as it perfectly blends fantastic and diverse soundtracks, acting-styles and photography.<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" is undoubtedly a movie to add to your collection. It is never too shocking, disturbing or exciting, as that would be distasteful. However, if it doesn't make you look at life through a new lens, check if you still have a pulse.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|No comment on the quality of the image as its crystal clear.<br /><br />Great plot, beautiful music, and 'keep you guessing ending' even though it 'ends' which is a nice touch. Good cast too. Much better than \\"prestige\\" which was not pleasant to watch.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|It's a romance with mystery, magic, and very good acting from all the major players.  I really enjoyed it quite a lot, and (very rare for me) I wanted to see it again right after I had watched it.  If you really appreciate acting that relies on body language and expression over dialog only, you may like it as much as I did.  In addition, the sets were gorgeous and the music is entirely in the classical style (no \\"latest pop song\\" interludes here.)
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I am not going to explain this movie or the plot cause every one else does this. I am going to tell you my opinion of the movie. If you read my reviews you will see what type of movies I like. I saw the original Rocky and Rocky 2 in the movie theater. I can still remember the chills I would get when the theme to Rocky would play. When I went to see this opening night and the theme started I still got the chills. It was a great moment to feel, something like that again from my childhood. Don't get me wrong  I was still skeptical of this movie being any good,after Rocky 5. I was worried the same ideas would be instilled in this movie. Sylvester Stallone could not have written this movie any better, any different then how this movie was written. In my opinion this movie is as good as the first and second. Sylvester did an amazing job writing this movie and did not make this movie a joke, like it could have been very easily. You need to watch this movie to understand where I am coming from. Great  emotion, action, flashbacks, and so many memories come with this movie!! 5 STARS!!
B000BJS4BM|5.0|Don't Listen to the 1 star reviews they just hate Madonna and have not heard the album at all you can tell from their reviews. Nothing about the album but the artist Madonna. Now for a review of each song.       Hung Up: Great song which samples Gimme Gimme Gimme A Man after Midnight the 1979 hit my ABBA. There is one part in this song where it slows down and you can hear 80's sound more pronounced and you hear a clock ticking then going off with another alarm clock going off at the same time, very clever. It smoothly moves into the next song.     Get Together: The beginning sounds like Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper. She sings \\"Can we get together I really want to be with you\\" The songs gets a little fast toward the middle with again amazing 80's sounds blended in while she is singing. It ends the same way it beginns.     Sorry: She says Sorry in 5 different languages and you hear in the background \\"I heard it all before\\" repeated numerous times with each time it gets louder and she sings \\"I don't want to hear, I dont want to know, please dont say your sorry\\". She also sings \\"don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap\\" great words. Towards the end she sings forgive in a few different languages then in English. This is one of my favorite tracks and is supposed the second single.     Future Lovers: Very different sound from the whole album. This one was produced by Mirwais Ahmadzai who is credited for producing her Music and American Life album. She sings this songs in a very seductive voice and sings \\"would you like to try and come with me\\". She sings \\"give me evidence of this brilliance\\" referring to the love. This has a futuristic disco feel to it and the synthesizers they use do wonders for this song. This is also very dancebale track and one of my favorites and I hope it becomes a single too. This type of sound puts you in a trance. The music goes into I love New York and you can hear a little of Ray Of Light while blends into the next tune.     I Love New York: My favorite track. This is by far the most danceable track on this album. The beats are very intense and has a rock feel to it. This song is brilliant. The lyrics are funny. Madonna sings \\" I don't like cities but I like New York other places make me feel like a dork\\" At the end you hear cop sirens going off. She sings this song with an attitude and near the end she sings \\" get off of my street\\" several times, its just great!!     Let It Will Be: Oddly titled track beginns with the violin and is very similar to the beginning of Papa Don't Preach from the True Blue album. She sings about success and fame. The chorus part is great and I love this song.     Forbidden Love: This is the slowest track on the album but is not a ballad. This title can also be found on Madonna's Bedtime Stories Album but this one is a lot better. The vocoder is used and she sings \\"forbidden love are we supposed to be together\\" and then sings it without the vocoder. This song is also very emotional and sad. The ending ends with numbers being count backwards from 5 and during each one a love line is said. This is just a beautiful song. This songs slowly blends into Jump. The way is blends is is pure genious.     Jump: Starts extacly like the beginning of West End Girls by the Pet Shop Boys. This is just a fun song and she sings \\"Are you Ready to jump, just take my hand get ready to jump. When she sings these lines you seriously want to get up and jump. She also sings \\"I work and I fight till I find a place of my own\\" referring back to her early years in the 80's.     How High: The vocoder is used again and it has a robotic sound to it in the beginning. Madonna sings and questions her fame again as she did in Let It Will Be and sings\\" was it all worth it\\" and \\"should I carry on will it matter when I'm gone\\". This song has grown on me a lot and has a great beat to it. It was also produced by Mirwais and Bloodshy and Avant.     Issac: A masterpiece by itself. It starts of like similar to soundsyou would hear in a lullaby story and then you hear a rabbi's chanting in the back. This song is obviously Kabbalah related. Madonna sings \\"wrestle with your darkness angels call your name can you hear what they are saying will you ever be the same\\" then you hear the chorus and the chanting again then she sings other versus and the chanting and the chorus follows through again. This songs usues quite a few sounds mixed in well expecially towards the end. There is a pounding sound an a few times near the end it's amazing then the chorus. It ends with a man talking.I find this song brilliant and hope it becomes a single. This track is the longest track a little more than 6 minutes, its brilliant though.     Push: Another genious pop blend from Issac. This song has a good hip hop feeling to it and if you listen to it it does have a little rap in it. Madonna sings \\"You push me\\" then in a hip hop rap fashion sings\\" to go the extra mile\\" and \\"when it's difficult to smile\\". This song she sings to her husband Guy Ritchie. The chorus is the best part and has such a happy feeling to it and is similar to \\"Don't Tell Me\\" from her Music Album.     Like It Or Not: A nice song to end this brilliant album. She sings \\"this is who I am you can like it or not you can love me or leave cause I'm never gonna stop\\". This song is mid tempo and not really fast. It ends beautifully with the guitars. Overall I give this album an A+. I dont skip any song. I would highly recommend it if you really want to dance hard!! Also don't forget to check out Madonna's American Life album a very underrated album indeed!    Fighting Spirit: On my god, I love this song so much. It has a good message \\"don't let it get you down\\" telling people dont ever let things get you down it is a mid tempo song with excellent use of the electronica sound. It would be worth getting this CD just for that song you have got to hear it it's simply amazing.    This Special Edition also includes a pretty journal book which hasMadonna's own writing in it from the song Like It Or Not, each part of it is a lyric from that song and is written at the bottom of each page and a few animations are drawn referring back to the song LION ( listen to the song and you will understand what I mean), the rest of the journal is blank so you can write your own confessions,  a nice picture book from the COAD period where she also writes her own confessions which is not from any of the songs on COAD or anyone other song at all that she has written, and it gives us the definitions of what the word confession means and a one month trial membership to ICON which I think is great. You can see if you are really interested or if it's worth subscribing to just for a trial period. Overall great package. Fighting Spirit of course is another reason you should buy it because it is not included in the original COAD and as mentioned it is so  good and it will help you out especially the lyrics in it if you are feeling down, had a bad day, or just feeling under the weather lately.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the most impressive nature documentary series I have ever seen.  I watched it in high definition on CBC Canada last fall, and that is the best way to see this series - in HD.  (It is being issued on HD-DVD and Blu-Ray in America - yay).  Breath-taking.  Unfortunately narrator David Attenborough has been replaced by Sigourney Weaver, sounding like a stern schoolmarm, for the American broadcast on the Discovery Channel.  I don't know yet which of them narrates the American DVD box set but if it's Weaver I will be very disappointed.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ANY AGE. I LOVE IT, IT'S ONE I CAN WATCH OVER & OVER. THE MUSIC IS GREAT, THE SETUP IS FANTASTIC, I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. JOHNNY DEPP DOES A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE IN HIS PORTRAYAL OF CRY BABY WALKER.
B000O174CM|5.0|I claim the record for a Texan seeing the original DREAMGIRLS on Broadway well over 50 times, and at least that many more in various roadshows between the August '85 closing and the movie.  The Imperial Theatre was packed that Sunday afternoon with DREAMGIRLS junkies, all of us having long before decided we'd be there for \\"the farewell performance.\\"  The live musical ended with Deena saying \\"Thank you, and goodnight.\\"  Except, this time, it was \\"Thank you.  And Goodbye!\\"  I'll never forget the guy in front of me yelling \\"GOODBYE!!!\\"  The huge sign DREAMGIRLS in front of the Imperial was turned off that evening, for me much of the charm of Broadway and NYC was forever gone.    A roadshow director, introducing the performance, noted \\"This musical affects people in unique ways,  many of them see in it parts of their own lives.\\"  He nailed it.      My concern with the movie was 'how badly would they screw it up.'  I saw an early preview,  was stunned that Bill Condon hadn't.  Adding Loretta Devine, the original Deena on Broadway, as the singer in Chicago who performs at Jimmy Early's memorial was a huge surprise, she's gained a wee bit of weight. <g>      Jamie Foxx was the only failure in the movie; he looked as if he'd rather be anywhere else than in it.  The final cut of the movie trimmed even more of his role from the early preview I first saw.  Just not enough.    I got \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" to see why Alan Arkin won Eddie Murphy's Oscar.  Life isn't fair.  Eddie wuz robbed!  Although, it's produced a trivia question,  what two nominees died from the same thing in '07.    I see periodically in the NYC papers that producers are working to bring the original production back to Broadway.  If you enjoyed the movie, you'll love the live-theatre version.  The song Loretta sings was originally sung by a chorus at a recording studio where Marty has Effie waiting for the arrival of a songwriter who's got a great new song for her, \\"Marty, I been waitin' for hours,  I heardso many doo-wops I'm ready to scream.\\"  \\"I'm sorry, his plane was late.\\" \\"Who's plane?  What's this all about?\\"      All Broadway shows are video'd for a reference library open only to scholarly researchers.  It's not likely the rights for a commercial video release of the early 80's live performance could ever be obtained.    In the interim,  get the September, 2001 two cd set from the 'one night only' benefit performance.  The original soundtrack from the early 80's, when cd's were relatively new, omitted at least half the musical so it would fit on one cd.  You'll understand what I'm writing about when you hear the September, 2001 two cd edition.    When the opportunity arises, add your votes for a video of the revival that, hopefully,  will be coming back to Broadway within the next year.  If you think the movie is powerful,  see it live!  And, hopefully, the producers will arrange to shoot the actual stage version.    \\"All you got to do is dream ...\\"
6305313687|2.0|i was eagerly looking forward to catching up with this movie id missed at the time of its release, esp since im a fan of both edward norton and eddie furlong (even as just an acxtor, lol). however, this was an overwrought and overthought mess. there is nothing here that hasnt been covered (sans the dirty language) in a slew of tv movies dating back to the episode of \\"twilight zone\\" where dennis hopper met hitler. and a bald eddie furlong is not much fun to look at. norton is less and less interesting an actor as time goes along, but at least here he was still trying.
B000002I53|5.0|The Liner Notes written by Bill Coss indicate that John Coltrane, one of the giants in the jazz scene, draw his inspiration from other jazz icons such as Lester Young, who was his first real influence and whom he learned \\"simplicity,\\" John Hodges, who filled his musical experience and became his first main influence on alto, Thelonious Monk, who answered dozens of his musical questions and the first one to show him how to make two or three notes at one time on tenor, Earl Bostic, who showed him a lot of things on his horn, Jimmy Heath, who shared his musical appetite, their friendship and practice together added a great deal to his musical development. Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were also his greatest influences.<br /><br />John Coltrane is surrounded by a gifted crew that includes McCoy Tyner (piano), Steve Davis (bass), Elvin Jones (drums). Together they present four notable jazz tunes starting off with my favorite song from the \\"Sound of Music,\\" Rodgers & Hammerstein's \\"My Favorite Things,\\" Cole Porter's \\"Everytime We Say Goodbye,\\" George & Ira Gershwin's \\"Summertime\\" and \\"But Not For Me.\\"<br /><br />Let your ears feast on the some of the most recognizable sounds of jazz music from one of the greatest jazz artists of all-time, John Coltrane. This is one of the best albums ever made and it's one of \\"My Favorite Things.\\"<br /><br />A classic of an album worthy to any jazz lover's collection.<br /><br />* * * * * TEN STARS * * * * *

1428144331|5.0|Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite writers. Ever since I picked up a copy of THE PACT, I have waited impatiently for each March to roll around, when a new book of hers appears. She is a loving, caring, sensitive woman who can make the reader empathize and sympathize with each of her characters. Who else but Jodi Picoult could make me sympathize with a wife beater ([[ASIN:0425185508 Picture Perfect]]), a kidnapper ([[ASIN:0743454553 Vanishing Acts: A Novel]]), or now a school shooter (NINETEEN MINUTES)?<br /><br />After reading this, I felt I had walked a mile in Peter, Josie, and Lacy's shoes. However, I agree with other reviewers that the abrupt ending was unbelievable and had plot holes you could drive a truck through.  A more realistic ending would have had Peter's parents becoming social pariahs, getting divorced, and getting sued until the cows came home.<br /><br />For a much more down-and-dirty, bone-chilling, brutal and realistic fictionalization of a school shooting, you have to read [[ASIN:006112429X We Need to Talk About Kevin: A Novel (P.S.)]] by Lionel Shriver. Some may not have the stomach for it, but you would be hard-pressed to find better writing anywhere.<br /><br />Give Jodi Picoult another try. Some of my favorites: [[ASIN:1416547819 Plain Truth]], [[ASIN:0743418735 Perfect Match: A Novel]], [[ASIN:0340838027 The Pact]], [[ASIN:0061374962 Keeping Faith]], [[ASIN:0743418719 Salem Falls]], [[ASIN:0743454537 My Sister's Keeper: A Novel]], [[ASIN:1416583866 Second Glance: A Novel]].
B000MCH5P4|2.0|I liked the story in the middle east, I enjoyed the story in Mexico, But the Japanese part was pointless. If you like movies like 21 Grams, and Crash you'll enjoy this film. If you dont, like me, you'll be waiting for it to finish an hour in a half into it. Unfortunatley, Directors are trying to be someone they aren't. Director's should stop trying to be a Tarantino or Scorsese and just direct films in they're own way. However, if they did that, they wouldnt have a job as a director. The movie's worth watching once when no good movies are available.
1904233023|5.0|For those of you out there with a teenage reluctant reader....this book is great! I gave it to my 14 year old son (just started homeschooling this year) to read for school. Halfway through the book he said the book was not too bad. After he finished the book he said the book was pretty good. That's music to my ears coming from someone who doesn't like to read. I think his view is starting to change.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|I love Paolo's raspy, soothing voice! Every song on the CD is great, although my favorites have to be Jenny Don't Be Hasty, Last Request, and These Streets. The CD came within 3-4 days and in great condition. This guy is brilliant and bound to be a major hit soon.
B000IFQLLY|5.0|Pretty much every song on this album is well-done and easy to listen to.  My favorites are \\"Just can't get enough\\" (a great song from the 80s) and \\"Enjoy the Silence.\\" <br /> <br />Their music is quite distinct and I listen to them always on long driving trips. This group really knows how to play. <br /> <br />Anyone who is in their 30s to 40s range will most likely enjoy listening to this.  However, I think anyone anyone at almost any age might like this CD.
B000NIVJEU|1.0|Fantastic movie but where are the special features. I thought the point of blu-ray was the space capabilities. Well once again, i think it is Sony sucking money out of customers. I was debating on the Blu-ray or the special edition version and made a poor decision as far as assuming the special features were included with the blu-ray. Don't get me wrong. The movie is fantastic (5 star) but the media was a 1 star. If your are the person that enjoys the extras (deleted scenes or making of's) then this is not worth the extra cash.  <br /> <br />And as far as i am concerned, HD-DVD should win
B00005RHGL|5.0|This,in my estimation,is one of the best Cowboy ie; \\"Westerns\\" ever made. The story line stays as close to History as possible and has a lot of humor, or tongue in cheek, from Val Kilmer et; Doc Holiday.A great cast and filmed manificiently. If you haven't seen it get it, if you have, get it for your library and watch it again, it's a great DVD.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|In my opinion the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the best rock band of our time.  I've been awaiting this new album for a few years now and I'm so pumped that it's finally here.  This was by far the best album of 2006, not just for the rock genre but all genres.   <br /> The band got back together with legendary producer Rick Rubin, who produced the band's groundbreaking album \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik.\\"  There's something about the band and Rick working together that just produces some of the best music ever done.  Everybody in the band is on top of their game on this album.  Frusciante sounds better than ever, and his solos are rockin.  Of the two discs my favorite is the first one but like said the whole album is great.  My favorite sounds on the album are: She's Only 18, Warlocks, Wet Sand, Hump De Bump, Readymade, and Slow Cheetah.  These are just my most favorite tracks, but I can listen to the album start to finish without skipping a track.  That is how I judge albums, if you can listen to the whole album all the way through without skipping a track it's a great album.  I give this album 5 out of 5 stars and can't wait to hear what they do next!
B000063DIR|2.0|Do not buy this CD.  I had the original LP and it kicked.  Since the guitar work had been redone by studio musicians, it stinks.  In the song Diary of a Madman, the guitar stomps on Ozzy's vocals.  I had to end up buying another copy of the original four days after I bought this one.  The cost of returning this one, made it prohibitive, and therefore I was stuck with this butchered version.
0451450523|5.0|In a world where men can no longer see unicorns for what they are, but perceive them as merely white horses, only one remains.  In her forest, untroubled by the world at large, she overhears a pair of hunters referring to her as the last and embarks on a hunt for the unicorns she believes may be hiding, perhaps waiting for her to save them.  In Peter Beagle's scrumptiously written fantasy novel, the unicorn's tale may seem at first glance like a familiar one: a magician as a traveling companion, encounters with evil witches and immortal creatures bent on capturing a unicorn, an evil king in his barren kingdom, transfiguration and talking trees.  What makes the tale uncommon is the telling.  Beagle doesn't so much tell the story as immerse the reader in it, the entire world shimmering to life around characters that are amazingly real for being so rooted in a world of magic.  When the unicorn is forced to become a woman to escape the powerful red bull that is hunting her, she begins to lose her sense of immortality and Beagle offers an interesting take on that staple of high fantasy, the love-struck price offering heroic tokens of his ardor to the beautiful princess.  I consider this an absolute must-read for fans of Beagle, the fantasy genre, or the classic animated movie The Last Unicorn.
1843104954|4.0|This is a well written book with plenty of information to answer all your questions.  It is techinical in spots, so you may need to re-read some of the topics. This book is recommended by therapists too in understanding this condition.
B000NA28IE|1.0|hi.....  i know that movies are never (usually) as good as the book they are based on, but this movie hits an all time low.  the book is good, not great, but good - or at least entertaining (if youve never read or seen star wars or lord of the rings, maybe you'll think its fantastic, but most of the storyline has been seen before)  that aside, i enjoyed reading the book....  i dont think the director read it.  the story flow is different, character personalities are different, the dragons voice is lacking, and so on.  i watched the movie when i was sick in bed, and all i got out of it was frustration.  i found myself saying, \\"i cant believe they did this - it must get better....\\"  it doesn't.<br /><br />dont buy it

B00006G8K0|5.0|Although Curse of Frankenstein launched Hammer's gothic cycle, it is their 1958 production of Bram Stoker's Dracula that remains their greatest aesthetic and narrative achievement. There are of course many Hammer films that rival Dracula, but in Hammer's most successful phase (1957-64) all the key ingredients reach their most successful synthesis. Director Terence Fisher, first and foremost an editor, creates some excellent parallels and doubles, and the film in fact is centred around a series of oppositions and dualities, in the shape of characters, spaces, gender, class and culture. This makes Fishers carefully composed shots and editing procedures particularly effective. Jack Asher's gorgeous cinematography drapes the film in sumptuous colour, and the beautiful gothic set designs gives the impression of a production far more expensive than the £81,000 it took to make. Furthermore the narrative hares along at breakneck speed, thanks to a Jimmy Sangster screenplay that removed much extraneous baggage from the novel. For Stoker purists, this version of Dracula would probably be rejected, but the result is a freedom and pace that almost every other version of the story has lacked. If all this isn't enough we get to see a snarling bloody mouthed Christopher Lee in one of horror cinema's greatest close ups, and the magnificent Peter Cushing leaping athletically onto a table and bringing the curtain down on the Count. Hammer's Dracula series never reclaimed the spirit of the first film, despite some interesting attempts (\\"Dracula has Risen from the Grave\\" and \\"Brides of Dracula\\" for example) and this film has now rightly taken its place in the pantheon of horror masterpieces.
B0002KQNUO|5.0|This CD is a bacchanalia.  It is ecstatic and blissful and alien and sad and insane.  There are so many worlds contained in this music that it's hard to describe.  I have to say I've loved this CD for more than a decade and it has been a source of constant agony and joy and ecstasy.  It doesn't age.  It is a classic.  There are so many nuances in it, so much fantasy, madness, passion and creativity that it is truly one of a kind.  Each song produces a peculiar state of mind.  I don't know how else to describe this experience.  I'd say my favorite experiences are Mirki, Vai Vedrai, Querer (awesome!) and Valsapena.  Please buy it and take the time to listen ... REALLY listen to it and experience it.
0156030306|5.0|This is one of the first novels I read from cover to cover, so that immediately tells you that the book is great.  I love how everything transitions by the way the main character's journal entries change.  The plot may sound more like a science fiction film, but it is really more of a drama.  I can't wait to find the time to read the book again!
B00005K1ZH|5.0|This is best mini replica version available.  Sound is unbelievable.  HDCD decoding and perfect replica or original LP.  Get it, you won't regret it.
B000007MVL|5.0|I discovered Kate Bush almost by accident when I was studying in Europe almost 25 years ago.  I only had a cheap little cassette player and while I bought just about everything I could get ahold of at the time (which was everything up to and including THE DREAMING), I knew full well that could only be that much better with a reasonable (let alone audiophile level) sound system.    But actually, the muddiness of those tapes made them somehow all the more intriguing.  I couldn't make out most of the lyrics, but what I could decipher was strangely fascinating.  (This was in the era, of course, when cassette versions of a record seldom--if ever--included a lyric sheet).  Listening to Kate was just one more example of the kind of code-breaking I had to do every day, learning another language and negotiating another culture.  (The fact that she threw in the occasional German or French phrase kind of emphasized her European-ness and may have added to the attraction--she was, however, obviously veddy British, in a very GOOD way).    Some people have made mild fun of her own Anglophilia as it's demonstrated here on the (kinda sorta) title track, \\"Oh, England My Lionheart.\\"  Penned by some accounts on the eve of her first foreign tour, it may seem at first like a schoolgirlish expression of advance homesickness.  But once I finally did get ahold of a lyric sheet, I realized it was much more than that.  If anything, the song's patriotism is muted by melancholy.  Those air raid shelters were \\"bloomin' clover,\\" but for how long?    It would only be a few years later that Kate would be singing of fall out shelters on NEVER FOREVER's \\"Breathing\\" after all.    I wouldn't be surprised if many of the tracks from this album were from her storehouse of material penned during her adolescence.  That doesn't speak ill of them necessarily, but in all likelihood the Kate Bush of a few years later would have avoided mentioning Peter Pan in TWO songs on one album.  That risks \\"preciousness\\" in the eyes of many--and certainly did in the eyes of macho American rock critics--but, sorry, both the aformentioned \\"Lionheart\\" and \\"In Search of Peter Pan\\" work despite, if not BECAUSE of their defiant whimsy.    I often risk belaboring the point of the readily apparent kinship between Kate Bush and the equally precocious American singer-songwriter Laura Nyro.  I'll try to avoid harping on that theme, since I don't even know for sure whether Bush even claims Nyro for an influence.  But it's hard not to think of Laura's famous musical synesthesia (she use to tell her accompanists to \\"play purple,\\" for instance) when listening to Kate's equally color-themed \\"Symphony In Blue\\" and her sensuous \\"In the Warm Room\\" (so reminiscent of the early Nyro composition \\"December's Boudoir\\").    But Kate also had more of a sense of the theatrical (Laura's MUSIC was pretty dramatic, but her stage presence was muted) and she exhibits here more of a sense of humor, however bizarre.  \\"Symphony in Blue\\" is puns more than once on \\"blue/blew.\\"  And songs like \\"Coffee Homeground,\\" which is either about ARSENIC AND OLD LACE style murders or the paranoid fear of same, serves as a kind of nightmare novelty song, vaguely reminiscent in its Germanic 30s jazz feel of Grace Slick's equally remarkable \\"European Song.\\"  It's also something of a precursor to the even more paranoid, in fact downright nightmarish \\"Get Out of My House\\" from Kate's own masterful 80s release THE DREAMING.    Like some of this CDs other enthusiastic (including a namesake almost directly below), I am rather baffled that this brilliant, innovative record is considered by many (including Kate herself, I now learn?) to be among her weakest efforts.  I find it a pure delight.  What it did not do is break much new ground after KICK INSIDE.  And it has fewer songs.  That hardly makes for a true \\"sophomore slump.\\"  The worst you could say about it is probably that Kate was in something of a holding pattern.  Hardly a bad thingwhen you consider the quality of the pattern.  Or when you consider how much further she would be taking her music within the matter of just a few short years.
B000K2Q7T6|5.0|You know Tupac had to have been working day and night when he was alive, since he died he had quite a few albums with previously unreleased material come out, plus all the music he made when he was alive.  <br /> <br />I think this CD is pretty good, the best songs are Pac's Life, Sleep, and Untouchable Ft. Yaki Kadafi, Hussein Fatal, and Gravy. <br /> <br />I know there was another version of Untouchable he did with Left Eye from TLC. Too bad that version's not here.   <br /> <br />
B000MCH5TK|4.0|It was a great movie. However, many people don't like these kinds of movies and we didn't feel that it had the full Blu-ray high definition. Meanwhile, I like the kind of Drama in it. The way of knowing a lot of different cultures.
6305014140|5.0|One of the best Jap Anime of all times, a true classic. Has the perfect plot and enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat. Can't help but to get lost in it all, very hypnotic. All the characters have true personality, the snake woman is my fave by far!
B000000W5L|5.0|it's been fashionable to bash the stones in some quarters for about a decade or so. heck, i've done it myself on occasion. true, they haven't made a great album since \\"some girls,\\" but i think their releases over the last 20 years have not been as bad as some would make them to be. i believe they are current victims of their early work to some extent. take \\"exile on main st.\\" is it fair to hold all of their work up to the standards set here? any band should be so lucky as to create one majestic piece of work as this. i listened to it on headphones at work today (the first time i had listened to it in over 4 years), and it was like some kind of musical epiphany. almost a religous experience; without all the wacky ideas. the religion of rock and roll. this really might be the greatest record ever made. the one two punch that kicks things off, \\"rocks off\\" and \\"rip this joint\\" are certainly as good a start to any album i know of. there's the sublime heights of \\"tumbling dice\\" for your soul to climb, the incredible beauty of \\"torn and frayed,\\" the heavenly acoustic blues of \\"sweet black angel,\\" the majestic power of \\"loving cup,\\" the keith richards philosophy lecture \\"happy,\\" \\"turd on the run,\\" with its perfect blending of rock riffs and blues, the raw hard edges of \\"venitilator blues,\\" with its wicked slide guitar work, \\"i just want to see his face,\\" the strangest song on the record, a spooky sounding sort of anti-gospel with hazy vocals drifting over a rumbling bed of percussion. there's the heart-pumping beat of \\"all down the line,\\" \\"stop breaking down,\\" another outstanding blues rocker with a pulsing beat and fine slide guitar, the gospel asthetics of \\"shine a light,\\" and the gritty anthem \\"soul survivor,\\" which closes this soul stirring masterwork. if you do not have this, you need it. if you do not like this, we could never hang together. as a music (especially rock and roll) fanatic, this album brings me to rapture. enough said.
B00003CWPL|5.0|My all time fave Lynch film! Such a classic and timeless, the mood is strong, like the shadows of your imagination. A nightmare fantasy that I could get lost in, like going into a variety of dimensions, in your wall, behind your radiator, in your light bulb, etc. This film has true substance and allows you to understand that negative space is more important than positive space or just as important. The atomsphere is thick with dimension, sometimes we forget about that, it holds together all that is and not was isn't. Love Jack Nance's hair!
B000E1155E|4.0|seems to be one of the more highly acclaimed albums by the critics in 2006. Q magazine picked it as the best album of the year, and mojo magazine selected it as number 3. it took me three or four listens to really get into, but now i'm there. these are modern urban english folk songs played out on frantic electric guitars and sung by a singer with boat loads of vocal personality. the music has the driving rush of punk, the power chords and guitar solo's of classic rock, and the quirky rhythms of post-punk. explosive stuff that i highly recommend to all rock fans.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|It's really a good colelctor's edition. I'm only slightly irked, that this was not done earlier and that there are now two collector's editons. But the postcards are of really good quality, the script and the book are intersting and most of all, we get the \\"Last Order\\" which until now only lucky few could ever see, a story featuring Zack's and Cloud's escape.  <br />A must have, if You don't already have the previous limited edition. Enjoyable too, if you do.

B000I5X81K|3.0|I bought this CD because I am going with my daughter to his concert on March 28th.  I like to preview the music before I attend concerts.  Josh Groban has an amazing voice that just matures and becomes richer as he grows his career.  The only disappoinment in this CD to me is that so few songs are sung in English. And there is no translation of what he is singing as part of the CD packaging, so I have no idea what the songs are saying.  They are beautiful, just not understandable!

1593080255|5.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray will eternally go down as a classic.<br /><br />This novel - whether you are reading it word by word or reading it knowing the historical background and many many illusions thrown throughout the novel - will appeal to you.<br /><br />From the beginning to the end this novel is amazing. It makes you contimplate your interior wishes. The ending is shocking - which just puts another tally for \\"classic\\".<br /><br />If you are looking for a classical novel that you can read over and over again and spend hours discussing it (either with people or just personal contimplations), I recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray.

6305882592|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and I was so pleased that it was in such good shape.  The picture was clear and the words matched the people's lips--always nice when that is the case!  I'm so glad that I purchased this for my library!  For those of you who haven't seen this movie, it's a little off the beaten track.  It does include quite a few special effects, and an original plot.  Also, it has a great soundtrack by Cat Stevens, with some of his music that I like the most!!!  The one drawback would be that at the beginning it is somewhat graphic---if you are sqeamish, this one is not for you.  I Love this movie!!!
B000N4SHPS|4.0|It is easy enough to say that \\"Rocky Balboa\\" is a much better ending to the cinematic saga of Sylvester Stallone's most famous creation than \\"Rocky V,\\" because that 1990 was clearly the bottom of the barrel for the franchise.  But \\"Rocky Balboa,\\" the new \\"last\\" Rocky movie is not only a lot better than the last \\"last\\" Rocky movie, it does a good job of bringing things full circle and reminding us of why the original 1976 film scored a big upset by winning the Academy Award for Best Picture.<br /><br />Adrian has died and Rocky's son (Milo Ventimiglia) is tired of living in his the shadow of his famous father, who spends his days at his wife's grave and his nights at his bar.  With his old friend Paulie (Burt Young) in tow, Rocky visits all of his haunts from the old days (that is to say, from the first film), and pretty much everything is in ruins.  The exception is \\"Little\\" Marie (Geraldine Hughes), the kids who rejected his advice in the original film with the comeback \\"Screw you, creepo.\\"  She is grown up now and a single mom, and when she denies she ever said anything that rude he assures her that she did, adding a comment about the longevity of great insults.  Rocky takes an interest in Marie and her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III), hoping to fill the voids in his life but never thinking that they are replacing his wife and son.  Then the Fates once again intervene in his life and give Rocky an unlikely match against the unpopular current heavyweight champ, Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), which means it will be time to cue Bill Conti's famous music, go through another training montage, and have Rocky climb the steps at the Philadelphia Art Museum.<br /><br />However, all of that happens relatively late in the film.  Of course, Stallone wrote and directed the grand finale, and having thought long and hard about his character that is primarily what this film is about.  The fight is a necessary part of the Rocky formula and therefore of this story, but most of the memorable scenes and lines from this film come before Rocky ever steps into the ring.  One of the casualties of the Rocky franchise was the fantastic lesson of the original film that you can be a winner without winning.  That is the sort of thing that Yogi Berra might say (or that Joe Garagiola might say that Yogi said), which is quite apt since Berra's \\"It ain't over 'till it's over\\" is the film's tagline.  But such ideas are at the heart of the Rocky mythos and Stallone has not simply returned to them, but found a way to rearticulate them in terms of the life of his character at this age and at the center of his shrinking circle of family and friends.  One of his best moves is that the big fight is meaningful for his opponent as well.<br /><br />Stallone is not only working off of the Rocky mythos but also drawing inspiration from the real world of boxing, explicitly updating the original computer match that had Rocky Marciano beating Muhammad Ali.  There is also the idea of the ex-champ's restaurant, which harkens back at least to Jack Dempsey's place, where he tells stories and poses for photos (Ali makes people pose for shots where you put your fist against his chin like you are landing a hard one on him).  Stallone knows that even those who do not own a George Foreman grill probably know that he was the oldest man to win the heavyweight crown even if they do not remember how old (Foreman was 45 when he won the title, 20 years after losing it to Ali, and would hold it another three years).  So in Stallone's screenplay Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon gets the chance to prove the computer wrong and as soon as that robe comes off in the right before the fight it is clear that even at \\"50,\\" Rocky is totally chiseled and in a lot better shape than Foreman.  We are also reminded that Stallone knows he is doing when he choreographs a fight.  Included in the deleted scenes is an alternative ending that only reinforces what we already knew: namely that what you see in this movie is the way the saga of Rocky should end (Stallone's commentary track is well worth listening to as he juggles his varying perspectives as writer, director and actor).<br /><br />For me things get a bit too artsy in the fight, where suddenly shots are looking like a cross between \\"Raging Bull\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" and every since that slow-motion fall and rise ending to \\"Rocky II\\" I start to worry when Stallone starts getting too cute.  But whereas previous bouts have been about Rocky finally landing the big blow, this one is definitely all about Rocky being hit.  In case anybody does get the point, the key line in the film echoes in Rocky's mind at the pivotal moment: \\"But it ain't about how hard you hit, it is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much can you take and keep moving forward.\\"  We have had ample reason to be cynical and Stallone and his creation for a couple of decades now, but both the creator and his creation evince a lot of the heart that made us care about them in the first place.he way the saga of Rocky should end (Stallone's commentary track is well worth listening to as he juggles his varying perspectives as writer, director and actor).

1569242739|5.0|\\"Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World\\" is the most awesome baking book I have ever had. My first try with it was the basic vanilla cupcakes for a party. Everyone loved them. They were a huge hit. And when I revealed that they were vegan, no one believed it. \\"But they're just like REAL cupcakes!\\" people said. That's the thing with this book--the authors break the whole egg/butter paradigm. Delicious cupcakes, both plain and fancy, with no animal products. My friends love them, my colleagues devour them, my mother of the million food allergies delights in them...(gluten-free folks rejoice: this book has got recipes for you.) A particularly good feature are the explicit directions and trouble-shooting help. If your cakes don't rise or are your frosting is too lumpy, they have advice. Even inexperienced bakers will feel comfortable using this book. But I have had no problems with any of the recipes I've tried: rest assured, if you follow their directions faithfully the cakes will come out perfectly. My only caveat is that the authors like things really sweet. But I frequently reduce the sugar in the recipes by 1/3 and everything comes out fine.
074356619X|3.0|The \\"universe\\", \\"ask\\", \\"belive\\", \\"receive\\", religious \\"tradition\\".  It is unsettling to apply metaphysical and New-Age terms and points-of-view.  Especially considering that these points of view have been espoused by all of the theologies. Is it valuable for us to have a secular religiosity?  Perhaps it is.  I have had a lifetime of spritual emphasis.  I have never really applied the PHYSICAL, practical lessons of the New Testament --- for example: Matthew 7:7 \\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: <br />7:8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.\\"  Of course, the grator in this case is GOD, not the universe.  The author of The Secret adequately obfuscates the identity of God and the universe as to make them one-in-the-same.  I am not sure I can subscribe to that ... perhaps some real-\\"world\\" application, including the Prince of the World will offer some enlightenment.  Three temptations were offered to Christ by satan - Matthew 4:2-3 ,  Matthew 4:5-6, Luke 4:5.  I do not know of other religious perspectives on GOD and the sovereignty of GOD ... but, I am pretty sure none of them think that GOD is the universe. and all of them think that GOD (however named, or interpreted) is a omnipresent, omnicient, and omnipotent spiritual being.... perhaps someday we will all know the meaning of GOD and of the universe.-- <br /> <br />Is \\"The Secret\\" a practical application of New Testament teachings? <br /> <br />

When you identifiy with a character on a personal level you suffer through their troubles as your own.

0439813786|5.0|i heard and interview on the radio with the author and decided to give it a try.  although not a new concept, it is one that is not used very often or to the extent that brian selznick did in the invention of hugo cabret.  combining a written story with illustrations.  the detailed illustrations do not supplement the reading, they are an actual part of the story.  when the writing ends or stops, mid chapter at some points, the next page or pages continue with black and white drawings continuing the story, and then the writing starts back up again.   <br /> <br />i have been reading this novel with my children (age 5 and 7) for bedtime reading and both are captivated by the plot following the young hugo cabret and his automaton, a mechanical man.   <br /> <br />we're half way through the book and can't wait until tonight to continue.
074356619X|3.0|This product wasn't quite what I was expecting.  While I did find portions of it motivational, the concept was the same for all areas and the CD Set could have probably been 1-2 CD's instead of 4.
0446677450|4.0|I agree with the positive and negative reviews of this book.  If you are looking for a book that tells you step by step \\"How to get rich\\", this book is not for you and you're not ready to do what it takes if you still need someone else to tell you what to do. <br /> <br />Instead, this book is for someone ready or starting out.  It relates stories comparing \\"rich dad\\" to \\"poor dad\\" and walks through mindsets and exercises.  For example, what is the difference between assets and liability and how good are you categoriztaion of items into these two areas?  This book deals with basic habits that differentiate the \\"rich\\" from the \\"poor\\".  I've read 3 books in the series and \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" is the foundation of starting out. I've read \\"Cashflow Quadrants\\" and \\"Real Estate Advantages\\" and I'm about to read a 4th \\"Own your own corporation\\" as well as another book referenced within one of them that received excellent reviews and goes into greater detail in the subject of interest.  <br /> <br />It seems that as the series progresses and his advisors take over writing books, it becomes more detailed and they do provide references.  It is comparable to the \\"Idiots guide to...\\" but gives references to follow up on if any particular section peaks your interest and you feel that you should know more.  At the very least, you can read it and understand why you'll always be a poor employee and it really is you're own fault.
B000E6UWE4|2.0|A few minor passages in the book describe characters whiling away their time by playing a card game with a divination deck, wherein one player changes the rules on the fly to benefit his hand, and the other player just goes along with it, not caring much about where the game is leading. Oddly enough, this scenario captures the essence of my reading experience; the author making up rules on the fly, and me just passing the time as one vaguely meaningful image appears after another.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I admit to being a Stallone and \\"Rocky\\" fan for many years. Yet I was disappointed when I learned that Adrian wouldn't be in the movie. Well, I should have remembered to trust Stallone's judgment. Adrian's spirit is very  much alive in this film, and Rocky's need to get rid of the anger is a stimulating plot point in this story. This story has heart. The film moves very quickly because of the story, the great acting of Stallone and Young, and also Geraldine Hughes as Marie is a delight. The final fight blew me away. This is a fitting conclusion to the Rocky series. I bought it on its release date today and have devoured it. I highly recommend it.
B00009ATIX|4.0|Solaris explores ideas about what it means to be human.<br /><br />It has the feel of a European-made film, but with a Hollywood budget.<br /><br />Soderberg, James Cameron, and George Clooney deserve high marks for being uncompromising in keeping to the spirit of the the book.<br /><br />The original Russian film was long, talky and slow-moving - with poor special effects. The original Lem book was also rather wordy. Soderberg explores similar ideas but keeps things moving forward and concise.<br /><br />The production design and visual effects are really cool.<br /><br />Be warned this film is for the 2001:A Space Odyssey crowd, not for the Alien(s) crowd.<br /><br />A fine achievement by the film-makers.
B000005JA8|5.0|In terms of tone and cultural significance it is the aural equivalent of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I listened to it in front of the Antiques Roadshow with the sound off, a bag of lemon bon bons and a shonky spiff and here's something I don't mind telling you music lover ... it were a proper treat ... \\"When Big Joan comes out her arms are too small, her head like a ball, she tied off her horse and galloped off into the moonbeams, she pulled up her blouse and compared her navel to the moon ...\\" I don't know who she is but my geography teacher was called Joan so I like to think it's about her.
0307346609|4.0|This is my first experience with Max Brooks.  I also picked up his Survival Guide, but I wanted to tackle this \\"more serious\\" book first.  If you ever loved a zombie movie or just the concepts BEHIND the zombie movies we've all seen, this will be an enjoyable read.  But its not about gun-blasting gore, its about personal fights for survival, people turning on each other, and how societies and governments collapse in the face of an epidemic that no-one can fully comprehend until it's too late. <br /> <br />Some of the personal accounts fill in the overall backstory, while others are deep, desperate fights for survival that you wished would go on for several more pages than they often do.  Very enjoyable, the kind of book you read \\"just one more chapter\\" into late in the evening.  I'm about 3/4 of the way through, and at no time have I found the book 'dragging'. <br /> <br />The only real problem I have with the writing are the thinly-veiled references to both current events and pop-culture.....because they are always ambiguous references, they completely throw me out of the moment.   <br /> <br />We are given a world that is rich in detail, and yet whenever a \\"current mid 2000's era\\" person or event is referenced, its always a vague implication. <br /> <br />Example, we are given references like (and these are examples of my own, not necessarily from the book) \\"the president who started that unpopular war!\\" or \\"the skinny celebrity girl who was famous just for being famous\\", and so on.  After seeing this referencing creep up for the 10th, 11th, 12th time, you have to stop and ask: What is the author afraid of?   <br /> <br />Historical facts about world history are presented, countries are named.  We don't get \\"The gigantic Asian landmass with the highest population\\"...we get \\"China\\".  But when it comes to people and events, we get \\"brushfire war\\" instead of \\"Gulf War\\".   Its distracting, and whenever I come upon one of these blurbs I go \\"oh not another one\\". <br /><br />Thankfully, it's a small caveat to an otherwise fantastic book, one I'm glad to have up on the shelf.    I would gladly buy a followup to this one, more survival stories from when the dead walked the earth! <br />
B00005JM20|5.0|If you ever fall in love with Mr. Bean, the UK comedy television series, you should fall in love with Johnny English as well. It is one of an outstanding comedy films that combines the clumsiness, laughing out loud moments, and romantic scenes of Rowan Atkinson who is a director himself. It can be described as the combination of Mr. Bean and James Bond 007. <br /> <br />The film has some similarities in both Mr. Bean and James Bond 007. There are many moments in Johnny English that remind the viewers of Mr. Bean. One of them is when Atkinson is in the shower with a duck toy that babies usually play with when they take a shower. This film is different from Mr. Bean due to the fact that the viewers will not be able to hear audiences laughing when Atkinson does something stupid that we usually hear from watching Mr. Bean. It is a film not one of the series that ends in half an hour. The film itself takes about one hour and twenty-eight minutes. In Mr. Bean, the viewers can easily notice that Atkinson plays in the role of a mute person, but not in Johnny English. He speaks with his British Accent in Johnny English. It is also different from James Bonds 007 on account of the film being taken only in United Kingdom instead of all over the world.
B000H305U0|5.0|I liked this CD even more than I thought I would, especially songs 6-12.  There is a nice variety of slow/fast songs, and it would be a great work out CD.  It is energetic and somewhat fun on most songs.  The last song is a good classic \\"I'm sorry, baby, come back to me\\" R&B that is really smooth and good.  Justin Timberlake is a very talented artist/song writer, and it comes through well in this CD.

0385338694|4.0|I read \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" years ago when it first came out, and loved it. Kinsella's over-the-top and highly unrealistic characters were fresh and funny. I was thrilled when she wrote a sequel to the first Shopaholic book, then grew increasingly weary of each new sequel - I felt like Becky needed to just live happily ever after with Luke and stop getting herself into such ridiculous predicaments.  <br /> <br />Then I read \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\" which was a fun book as well, and a nice reprieve from her Shopaholic series. I was skeptical of \\"The Undomestic Goddess,\\" mostly because of the trite title and highly unrealistic premise. I was definitely surprised to have enjoyed the book so much! I laughed out loud in a lot of places, was touched in others, and could (to some extent) identify with Samantha's ordeal of having to choose the simple life over her high powered career. Kinsella also did a nice job of developing characters with natural conflicts that moved the plot along quickly and made Samantha's dilemma more difficult.  <br /> <br />The ending could have been a lot better, but overall this was a fun, fluffy read in typical Kinsella style. <br />

0340854332|5.0|I have read Skellig to classes of both 5th and 6th graders with great results. David Almond writes about that \\"twilight\\" world where things aren't quite real, but they're not all fantasy, either. It's that world you see through squinted eyes. It's a world full of real problems and tangled emotions given one \\"what if\\" twist. I really like that about him. His stories are full of symbolism and metaphor to explore, discuss, and wonder about. Once kids start looking for the symbols, they run with it and find them like Easter eggs. Almond's is a very adult way of writing that is unique in the world of children's books. <br /> <br />His use of language is masterful. The book's achingly beautiful scenes are balanced by a very gritty reality that has numbed the soul of the characters. This is a common thread in all of his books: Children, or teens, are struggling with a world that is crushing them in some way. Then, through literary twists, that struggle becomes mythic and transcends. <br /> <br />I have an advanced 4th grader reading it now and wanting more. So do I. As an educator, storyteller, and poet--I love this book!

This movie truly leaves you with a heavy feeling.  I was definately affected by it.  Although the premise of the movie is mildly far-fetched, the society built around it was all too real.  I don't buy a lot of movies and I don't watch a lot of drama, but I'll keep on my shelf next to \\"The Shawshank Redemtion\\" for my viewing pleasure the next time we have a worthwile movie drought.

0802130208|5.0|This book is marvelously amoral and it will do little to raise anyone's social conscience. Ignatius is a ridiculous name for a protagonist and the author makes him so disgusting that the reader doesn't know what to make of the guy or his story. As a piece of literature it is brilliant, oddly beautiful, funny as hell, and impossible to place in any known genre. I recommended this book to my 22 year old son and he practically has it memorized. We now call each other up and talk about our pyloric valves. When I was his age I didn't really get this book. I love it now.
B000NA28IE|1.0|First of all, my sentiments agree with the March 14, 2007 review by S. Ulrich.  (Read that one.)  I had such high hopes for the movie, since the book is a great read.  Yes, it is very derivative of Star Wars as many reviewers have written, but still a good story. <br /> <br />Obviously when the author sold the movie rights to his book, he did not maintain any veto power as to how much they could butcher his book, and the movie makers did just that.  Yes, if they had tried to include everything that was in the book, in the movie, it would have been long.  So why don't the movie producers just break a long movie up into two parts and release them 2-3 months apart?  They could have made twice the money releasing a 2-part, 4-hour movie and most fans would have been thrilled.  Not exactly rocket science. <br /> <br />If you are really curious about this movie, then rent it first.  Better to waste $4, than $22.79 (Two-Disc Special Edition). <br />
0747554668|4.0|There isn't too much to say about this slender volume. J.K. Rowling wrote this book in 2001 (along with Quidditch Through the Ages) as a companion to her enormously popular Harry Potter series, as well as to benefit the British charity Comic Relief (not related to the American charity of the same name). The book is presented as one of Harry's textbooks, complete with notations and scribbles by himself and his friends. After a long and quiet amusing forward by \\"Albus Dumbledore,\\" the book presents an alphabetical listing of many of the magical beasts and creatures that inhabit Harry Potter's world. The book is mostly played for fun, but it does offer a little more information about the creatures themselves and the history of Harry's world, something any hardcore fan of the series will certainly appreciate. I really picked this book up again for the first time since buying it in 2001 as a warm-up for a planned re-read of the entire series prior to the release of the final book, and it was nice to get a little more detail as I started my reading.

B00005JPGO|3.0|I've always been a fan of director Edward Zwick. Legends of the Fall, Glory, About Last Night and The Last Samurai are all very watchable. Blood Diamond is no different. DiCaprio is solid as ever but the films theme is slightly muddled. It's a little bit like Indiana Jones meets City of God. An odd comibination to be sure. It works well at times, but at others it's hard to tell whether its a light-hearted romp or a political piece of film-making. I liked it though, and it's deinitely worth a look as it's fairly unique.

This book looks at what Christianity does to our society that blinds us.  It also looks at Muslims and Jews with the same critical eye as to their contributions to the world.  Remember Harris is writing about the whole world.  So this book is about how ideas and belief systems get in the way of having a safe world and why all societies should consider whether religious absolutes are universally beneficial.  Not to hard to think about really.
B00005JLZN|5.0|Just one of those great movies that didnt get the recognition that it deserved. Of course, Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of his time in my opinion, but overall this movie is a must see.
0618477942|5.0|I can only describe this as a comic novel.  It is a new voice for me to hear from Alison, and one that I would gladly here more from.  The story is not entirely sad, and there are some extremely drily ironic moments.  A very good, easy read that I shared equally well with my wife, and my 19 year-old daughter.  My sister is next.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|This is a great CD.  It contains many styles of music.  What doesn't change is Norah Jones' calming, sophisticated voice.  I highly recommend it.
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|These guys are very talented and very smart and very true to themselves. They obviously master every musical style of the last 40 years, and if they wanted, they could have made 'alternative rock' crap that is selling by the pound in North America and become very rich. But instead, they choose to make pure pop, that is fun, humerus, unpretentious and sophisticated at the same time. They write catchy tunes, intelligent lyrics, and they perform them flawlessly. The lead singer has an amazing voice, there's no other way to describe it. There is not a single weak song on the album. Pick up a copy and you'll be singing along after two plays. What more can you ask from a pop album?
0062513346|5.0|This just may be my favorite book ever, and I read A LOT. I have read this book several times, and have given away at least 5 copies. I sold it from the shelves of my 'Angel Store' and my customers loved it too. Coelho writes with such a presence. He weaves the spritual story as the reader rides on the back of the words of the story. After writing this review, I think I will go and read it again. I think I just may be a Valkyrie. How about you?
B000BISBDY|5.0|Cant go wrong with CD no matter what you listen to. It is full of his signature attitude and style. Not much more to say that hasnt been said about the lengend, Johnny Cash.
1400049628|2.0|ok, i was pretty disappointed with this \\"survival guide\\". especially compared to the amazing \\"world war z\\" book. the narrative style of the guide is very dry and boring, the illustrations are horrible (just should have been left out), and most of the content is repetitive (aim for the head/brain, aim for the head/brain, aim for the head/brain). the book had little humor to it (which would have made it more interesting) and very little in the way of usable survival information (you could get more useful information in a basic camping/outdoors book). i know the author is trying to explain how to survive fictional creatures, but it could have been better mixed in with real-world information to make it more believable.<br /><br />it's an interesting companion to WWZ but very disappointing compared to that book. i recommend that one well over this book.
B000IFQLSW|2.0|Sorry, but this album is actually an album by Double Trouble featuring some old school blues greats propping up the player known as KWS.  Where is the personality of this player?  When will this player come clean and acknowledge his guitar teacher in Shreveport, LA? Mister Danny Wilder taught the player for years, and is continually \\"forgotten\\" in interviews and articles. Not only is Danny disrespected, but I actually read that the player claimed he had no lessons. A natural. Hmm. An artist who alienates those who fostered his success is truly paving the road with some bricks of bad karma. And, it is even audible. The music in this CD is neither inventive or is it that exciting. Stevie Vai had it right when he cut off the artist at the Hollywood Bowl back in 1996.  Hopefully, with time, this artist might redeem himself, but with this outing it is not evident.  Where is our generation's soul and integrity? As for the performances on this CD? Lackluster. So, two stars is generous. On the positive side, kudos for  capitalizing upon and using some truly great players, which attempt to elevate the artist to a higher level. And, the packaging is very nice.
0307346609|5.0|what an amazing read. i thought the survival guide was only so-so and didn't expect much from this one. boy was i wrong. i had to keep reminding myself this was a fiction book about an imaginary war. very well written, i could see the interviews going on in my head. every \\"person\\" interviewed had a different style of communicating i believed he actually spoke to different people. their stories grip you and pull you in, i wanted each one to go on beyond the few pages they had to \\"speak\\".<br /><br />my only complaint, is that there is so much more i wanted to know about the war and what happened to different people interviewed in the book. it definitely keeps you hooked.<br /><br />ignore the \\"survival guide\\" and read this book!
B000000WHX|5.0|if there is ever an overlooked album this is definitely one of them.  from the moment \\"Safe from Harm\\" starts we are encapsulated by this unique Bristol sound.  what makes this Bristol sound so unique is the using of vintage sounds and putting them into such new settings.  this album is definitely un-categorizable.  we have soul/R&B, dub, hip-hop and even the hint of the Portishead like vintage soundtrack sound.  this album is most certainly seed planting and both sides of the Atlantic have undoubtedly taken this to full advantage.  never has an album had a \\"i know i've heard this somewhere\\" kind of attitude. <br />
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This new DVD is absolutely wonderful. It has the highest quality recording and sound quality. The selection of songs is great and the performers are at their best.  Chloe sure looks a lot better than their first concert. An added treat was the appearance of Hayley Westenra, and especially her solo performance of Handel's \\"Lascia Ch'io Pianga.\\" The orchestra and backup singers are tremendous and the whole concert is beautifully choreographed.  This DVD is definitely a classic, and a \\"must have\\" for music lovers of all types.
B000003TSP|4.0|Portishead's second release comes as a surprise.  my first listen to it i felt rather disappointed.  beth gibbons' voice was distorted almost the whole time and a much more twisted use of sampling and scratching going on.  during my initial listen i was running short on time and could only sample bits of the songs.  i guess that is why my disappointment came through.  \\"Dummy\\" is very much a singles based album that can fulfill the effect it desires through quick listenings.  i still love the album and don't take that comment to be anything other than that.  this second album is a collection of songs, it is meant to be listened to straight through.  each song flows directly into another and gives a seamless tapestry and progression of the trip-hop sound.  of course Barrow and crew give us a sampling of singles like \\"All Mine\\", \\"Humming\\" and \\"Only You\\", but seeing where these tracks fit in with the album makes these tunes seem all the more significant.  after my first couple of listens (obviously with headphones on) i now \\"experience\\" this album rather than listen to it.  when recommending portishead i still have to give the nod to \\"Dummy\\", but any avid fan of trip-hop needs to have this album in their collection.  it makes you want more, but when.....
B0000025D0|5.0|Perhaps the best album of the 70's. There is no filler on this album. It's quintessential Bruce from start to finish.
B000002MX7|5.0|To this day, when I am alone and put THROUGH THE FIRE on....and I crank it....and sit back....she makes me shed tears as I imagine her performance in the studio. She doesn't just sing the song....she becomes the song. Amazing vocal range. I'm a huge fan.
006441034X|4.0|I loved the book, I loved the way Sophie finds out about herself. How many of us have hidden gifts inside ourselves and never dare to recognise them? How many of us are strong enough to brake the spell. It was an amusing book, with many levels of reading. I only wished the last chapter lasted a little longer.
0895260131|3.0|This book illustrates what a dogmatic religion can bring, by focusing on Islam. Islam apologists: When you claim that Islam is a religion of peace, please explain why it is the avowed purpose of Islam to convert everybody in the world - by force, if necessary, as is acknowledged in public, time and again, by purportedly moderate Islamic leaders. We do not want your faith, we reject your Islamic law, we won't live our lives under the oppression of Islam.<br /><br />  The shortcoming of this book is not to emphasize that dogmatic religions, other than Islam (Islam just being the worst in despicable bunch) are also potentially deleterious. Men like Pat Robertson, and his public calls for assassination, and the religion right in US, illustrate the point only too well.<br /><br />  I am sick and tired of you self-righteous people who, on the grounds of a body of ridiculously unsubstantiated mythologies, have used such beliefs to bring untold suffering to millions world over, even your own people: Witness the internecine war in Iraq these days, where member of two branches of the same pathetic superstition think nothing of blowing each other to pieces on a daily basis, or the long years of hatred and murder between protestants and catholics in Norther Ireland, or the ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia.<br /><br />  Thanks for bringing dogmatic belief and stifling independent, critical thinking.
B0006B2A42|5.0|Students of the cold war era will be thrilled with this one.  Rock Hudson as the tough submarine captain hero protecting us from the evil Soviets and our own Intelligence gathering organizations alike.  Great military jargon with lots of cold-war weapons systems.  The MiG flying over the ice is a classic thrill ride.  This spy-thriller is a must see.
0374105235|5.0|I learned of this book during Mr. Beah's interview on the Gail King Show and ordered it immediately.  It was all I expected and more.  Ishmael Beah tells a story that is both sad and triumphant.  It is very well written and he draws you into his world that was at best, horrifying, particularly for such a young child.  His suffering was profound, but one closes his book and feels nothing but pride for how he overcame so many obstacles and went on to tell his story to others in the hopes of sparing children around the world from the life he was forced to lead.  Mr. Beah, thank you for this powerful work.
1582701709|5.0|This book is amazing.  It is written for everyone to enjoy and to incorporate the teachings into their own lives.   I consider it a treasure!
0446691437|5.0|This book is brilliant. One of the best books I've read in years. If you find yourself struggling with any kind of creative block, or with the fear that comes from starting a new business venture, you should read \\"The War of Art.\\" It will give you the fortitude to keep moving toward your goal.
0195067142|5.0|If you have ever wondered what it was like during battle on a Pacific Island in the Second World War, read this book.  Eugene Sledge is direct to the point with a no holds barred first hand account.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for every politician.
0060005696|5.0|Professor Schwartz does an excellent job of covering the topic of choice and the impact it has on consumer behavior.  There comes a point when too many choices is counterproductive and this is well illustrated in this book.  It is well documented with plenty of research results.  All one has to do is check out the choices presented by Crest Toothpaste to realize that more choices isn't necessarily desirable.  Besides, what's at work here anyway?  More choices for consumers or grabbing more shelf space to crowd out competitors?  Professor Schwartz provides some great advice on dealing with choice.  I've read it twice.  You should too.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I have watched this series before firstly on Free to air TV then on Video and Pay TV.  The DVD set is compact and has heaps of extras. The quality is good and now I have a series that will last forever.  A great buy.
B0006ZE7G2|4.0|Pink Floyd's the Wall is not your typical rock concert like Tommy or Jesus Christ Superstar, but is an allegorical story about a rock star who is descending into madness. Each bad event in his life helps to add another \\"brick\\" into the wall of insanity that he, Pink, is building around himself to shut out the real world. While Pink is fictional, he embodies in part the story of real-life Pink Floyd member Sid Barrett whose LSD induced behavior ultimately got him removed from the band and elements of the way Roger Waters was was beginning to feel after touring for a long while which led to his writing The Wall.<br /><br />At turns grim, weird, bloody, violent, a bit sexy, and even a little bit funny, this movie is very compelling to watch even though it's not as easy to understand (for instance, the marching hammers). Yet, the lyrics of the accompanying Pink Floyd music helps to hold everything together so that the sum of the parts is much greater than the individual parts of this movie. I only gave it four stars instead of five because of the letterbox format that cuts away half of the screen if youhave a small TV set. If you had a huge projection screen it would be a different matter. While DVD offers more features, if you want to see the picture in all of its glory, then until a full screen version comes out (if there isn't one already) it's best to get the VHS version.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Oh yeah tight stretchy pants...David you are my hero...e[...] movie good songs enough said.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie is wonderful. I'm sorry but I don't agree with reviewer toddo. This movie will touch your heart. It will make you laugh, cry and feel the struggle that Chris and his son go through. Will Smith deserves every award he is/was given for this movie. Outstanding job!
B000063UR2|5.0|Ok, so I have seen this movie time and time again and everytime I see it, I always have to laugh...Tom Cruise is so friggin cute, prancing around with a mythological creature...where else but a movie... yeah right, we are talking real times people, nothing has changed. He is still prancing around w/ unicorns.
B000007491|5.0|I first started to like Supertramp when i used to listen to my father's copy of their compilation \\"Classics Vol. 9\\", and started building my collection starting from \\"Crime of the Century\\". I discovered this album for the first time from a Supertramp website and bought an original British copy of the LP from ebay. I never even realized there were albums before \\"Crime\\", and that there were guys named Richard Palmer and Bob Millar!<br /><br />The songs on the album have an overall sad feeling to them and I was also surprised to find all lead vocals by Roger Hodgson and none by Rick Davies. The songs I tended to enjoy the most were the two versions of \\"Surely\\", \\"It's a Long Road\\", \\"Aubade and I am Not Like Other Birds of Prey\\", Nothing to Show\\" and \\"Shadow Song\\" all stood out to me. I think this album shows a young band trying to find a good sound that would capture an audience.<br /><br />However this would not be. Unfortunately, the album failed to impress the public when released, and resulted in the departure of Palmer and Millar.<br /><br />If you're expecting to hear the classic, poppy \\"Breakfast in America\\", you're not gonna find it here! Its something dratically different.<br /><br />Overall, I highly reccommend this album to all the Supertramp fans out there. Its too bad this album is overlooked so often, and really deserves positive recognition!
B000069AUI|5.0|To any and everyone who is sick of generic rock bands, I enthusiastically encourage you to purchase this and everyone of Coldplay's Albums.  I started with a \\"Rush of Blood to the Head,\\" then moved to \\"X&Y\\" and only recently purchased \\"Parachutes.\\"  I can sum up the whole Coldplay experience with one word...Amazing!  As a singer song writer myself, I find myself listening to the music and absorbing the lyrics almost in awe.  For instance read the lyrics while paying close attention to the vivid imagery in the song \\"Spies,\\" soak in the melody, and ask yourself one question...who write's like that?  Noone.  You cannot listen to that song and not visualize your own mental music video.
B00000J631|5.0|This is one of my favorite punk compilations and I'll tell you why.  First, the ultra-short form means that each band's contribution is condensed down to its essence, giving you the most bang for the buck out of each song.  Second, it's got many of the best punk bands around:  the Circle Jerks, Nerf Herders,  Lagwagon, All, and the Misfits are some of my faves.  Third, it gives tantalizing snapshots of bands I didn't already know, meaning I get to buy more cds.<br /><br />Overall, this cd comes off as lighthearted and fun, unlike so many comps that have a \\"message\\".  Short music really stands tall for me.
B000M341QE|4.0|The cast here is fantastic, and Leo DiCaprio has got to be one of the most interesting actors of his generation. He is versatile and fearless in a way that I have not seen in a long time. The fact that Martin Scorsese and other A-list directors continue to seek him out for their films is a testimony to his talent. He is supported by some heavy hitters in this film, but he really carries this movie.<br /><br />This was also a plum role for Jack Nicholson, who is a lot of fun to watch here. Of course, you have to wonder if this is really acting for Jack -- the character of Frank Costello almost appears to have been based on Jack's own personality.<br /><br />I find it a little confusing to put Mark Wahlberg and Matt Damon in the same movie... is it just me, or is it difficult to tell these two guys apart?<br /><br />All in all I think it's a pretty powerful film, and the ending packs quite a punch.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie, but I have to say that it is not Martin Scorsese's BEST work. I have heard people compare it to Goodfellas, and that movie is just so well crafted, this one just doesn't quite come up to that level. Goodfellas is one of those few movies that if it's on, even in an edited version on TV, I can't change the channel -- I'm stuck there watching right up to the part where you see Henry Hill out in his bathrobe collecting his newspaper, missing his days as a gangster, when he was a big shot (and complaining about the fact that he's now just an average schnook who can't get a decent dish of spaghetti now that he's in the witness protection program...).<br /><br />After watching The Departed once, I'm sure I'll probably want to see it again at some point, but I just don't see it becoming one of my favorite movies.
B000A59PMO|5.0|If you have watched even one episode of this show and semi-liked it.  Start from the beginning. Veronica's character is SOOOO  witty!!!!!!  I am 32 and can't get enought of this show so I can tell you it is not just for teens and college age peole.
B0007KIFGE|4.0|From the very first scene you know that this film is going to showcase Owen Wilson being Owen Wilson.  I happen to enjoy his mixture of arrogant playboy with being insecure and endearing, and ever-flippant.  He mastered this in film successes like Shanghai Knights, Shanghai Noon (both with Jackie Chan), and I Spy (with Eddie Murphy).  <br /> <br />As to whether this is \\"based on a true story,\\" it is true that the real U.S. F-16 pilot (Scott O'Grady) who was shot down in Bosnia in 1995, sued 20th Century Fox in 2002 for \\"invasion of privacy.\\"  The irony to that is that his chief complaints were that they got the story wrong and portrayed him in ways that were unlike him.  Owen Wilson (named Chris Burnett in BEL) cussed throughout the film and makes a blatantly stupid decision upon being shot down.  O'Grady maintains that he did not act that way. <br /> <br />Aside from that reputation-protection, this film is one more great Owen Wilson flic, that will not only keep you smirking, but this one will make you feel like your finger is in a wall socket until the end. <br /> <br />Why not a 5 star?  Hollywood needs to learn that we viewers roll our eyes whenever they show us Mr. Hero getting shot at by a gazillion bad guys, and not one bullet hits our main man.  (To see a satirical look at the absurdity of this, see Arnold in The Last Action Hero.) BEL even has tanks shooting at our evasive star scampering away on foot.  Come on, a scratch on the cheek doesn't make those scenes realistic.  And the scene where he decides to go ahead and trip every booby-trap wire to ruin the day of his obviously-going-to-be-killed followers, was ridiculous. <br /> <br />Yes, the worst was the final scene.  Enemy tanks, rocket-launchers, machine guns all ablaze at goin'-Owen, and not one frickin' bullet hits him.  Ok, even if I can accept that, why did not one bullet hit the three Marine helicopters who just kept dusting the enemy chumps who were shooting away?  And his leap off the cliff (with one arm having just been shot) to grab the foot of some dangling Marine on a rope was a bit too much to believe.  And I couldn't swallow how Gene Hackman relaxed upon the \\"success\\" of now having their man \\"safe.\\"  Off they fly into the sunset, with our invinsible hero, holding on for his not-bored-anymore life. Oh well, enjoy. <br /> <br />I agree with the reviewer who noted the poor character development of anyone but Owen Wilson.  Even Gene Hackman comes off quite wooden.  The internal military conflict comes through that guy who played the latin-lover spy in Clear And Present Danger.  In this flic, I felt like flicking him off the screen, he was so blah and annoying.  And who the heck was he, anyway?   <br /> <br />Hey, you'll get to see Owen Wilson's nose without enough make-up to cover the deformity from his previous breaks.   <br /> <br />Somehow, I can't forget the image from Shanghai Noon where he is dreaming of having his ear nibbled by a sexy saloon babe, only to wake up to the reality of being buried up to his neck in desert sand and a vulture is doing the nibbling.  Behind Enemy Lines gives him a similar wake-up call.
B0000AI45P|5.0|I don't give out stars lightly. To rate a record 5 stars means to me that its one of the greatest records ever, of which there are perhaps 100. Marquee Moon is one of them.<br /><br />Television came out of the mid 70's NYC punk scene and may have had a punk attitude and fashion sense, but their music was the antithesis of the 3 chord, 90 second songs of Blondie and The Ramones. The first thing I remember thinking when I initially played Marquee Moon was that I've never heard anything quite like this before. The awesome guitar play, the sharp lyrics and Verlaine's high pitched, quavering voice gave them a unique sound.<br /><br />In later years I noticed some similarities between Television's guitar work and that of Neil Young's, particularly in Young's Cowgirl in the Sand and Down By the River.  I have a feeling you will find some Young in Verlaine's and Lloyd's record collections.<br /><br />The hardest thing about Television is describing their sound to someone. They just didn't sound like anyone else.  Though they were never a commercial success, their influences have been heard later in bands like the Strokes, Violent Femmes, Radiohead, Sonic Youth, The Killers and many more.<br /><br />Marquee Moon is Television's finest album, though I think the follow-up, Adventure, is vastly underrated. What \\"Freebird\\" is to southern rock and \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is to progressive rock, that is what the title track, \\"Marquee Moon\\" is to alt/punk rock. It's nearly 10 minutes of one of Rock's greatest moments of guitar interplay.<br /><br />Every song on this album is phenomenal. From the opening riffs of \\"See No Evil\\"  to Verlaine's plaintive wail on the closer, \\"Torn Curtain\\" the record is solid.<br /><br />Marquee Moon is now over 30 years old. The amazing thing is that the music is still as fresh today as it was when it when released.<br /><br />When this came out in 1977, if you looked back 30 years you saw artists like Guy Lombardo, Bing Crosby,  Mills Bros. etc..., all fine  artists in their own right, but that was grandma's and grandpa's music and had little relevance in 1977. The fact that Televison is as relevant, if not more so, in 2007 as they were in 1977 is a testament to their greatness.ma's and grandpa's music and had little relevance in 1977.

0553062182|4.0|I first read this book two years ago and just recently revisited it. As someone who is definitely highly sensitive by nature, I like the way Elaine Aron encourages HSPs to embrace, rather than change, their sensitivity. I resent the number of times I've been told I'm \\"too sensitive\\" or \\"too shy\\" or even \\"anti-social\\" by people who simply had no clue what makes me tick. I especially like her suggestion of \\"reframing\\" past events with an understanding of our innate sensitivity.  <br /> <br />And I very much agree with her rejection of the term \\"shy\\" for many of us. There's nothing wrong with accepting the label \\"shy\\" if you genuinely feel it applies to you. But I was labeled shy for many years and knew in my heart that it didn't fit, but bought into others' definition of me and tried to fight my \\"shyness.\\" I was struggling with an issue that, for me, was not the real one. I was simply overstimulated and overwhelmed much of the time, which would cause me to want to retreat and withdraw. It's such a disservice to label kids who are simply introverted by nature and/or highly sensitive \\"shy,\\" because as Aron states, it does tend to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, not unlike the child who is labeled \\"stupid\\" because he or she is dyslexic and has difficulty reading. <br /> <br />What bothers me about the book is that Aron often seems to contradict herself when talking about the HSP trait. For example, she says you should take steps to keep yourself from being overwhelmed by cutting back on activities and stimulation; on the other hand, she says you should not allow your high sensitivity to keep you from participating in activities and that you CAN handle stimulation. She says you should accept that because of your high sensitivity you will not be able to do all others want you to do; on the other hand, she says you should not use your trait to manipulate situations to your liking. After quite a few pages of such back and forth, I found myself thinking, huh? What is she saying, really? I think her point is that HSPs need to know themselves well enough to know when to push themselves and when to not to push. But maybe she could have stopped there. There's a little too much \\"You want to make sure you do this -- but you want to make sure you DON'T do that!\\" I found that confusing. <br /> <br />Her writing style is a little dry and detached, which after a while I began to find a bit irritating. And as another reviewer pointed out, this book seems more geared toward the baby boomer generation than Gen X (which is, apparently, my generation). But overall this book is an extremely valuable resource for those of us who are highly sensitive, and for those close to us who'd like to understand us better. It's certainly a must-read if you think you might be highly sensitive. <br /> <br />
B000002MP2|5.0|For my generation, this was the white album.  Back in 199whatever I was but a teenager in highschool, struggling to find myself and to find acceptance among my peers.  Alas, to no avail and I just ostracized myself from everyone.  Anyway, that isn't here nor there.  This was the genre-defying album that was the new face of punk.  It wasn't political like it's predecessors, nor was it purposely inaudible and obnoxious.  It was part of a new future for punk-rock as a genre.  It was scarey because it defied the punk creed.  At the same time it was amazing because it spawned an entire generation of \\"pop-punk.\\"  But none could ever par up to Green Day.  Dookie set the standard, and set itself apart from bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam.  It was still punk and the spirit they showed here remains even in their current latest effort, \\"American Idiot.\\"  Whether you like it or not, Green Day did something extrodinary with this album and it started a phenomenom that will always be remembered.  When I think of 90's music, I will always think of Green Day as a result.  Thank these guys for changing music history.
0374105235|5.0|Ishmael Beah has written a beautiful account of his early life and eventual conscription into the Sierra Leone army during their bloody civil war in the 1990s.  It's incredible to read about the terrible things that were done on both sides in the name of restoring order and peace.  Ishmael's story is typical in terms of what child warriors were forced to do but atypical because he actually managed to get out of it.  Beah not only puts a human face on the tragedy that occurred there, but perhaps most startling of all, he puts a human face on the killers because he himself was one. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a historical account explaining the greater events and politics involved in this conflict, this is not the book for you.  It gives only enough background so that the reader isn't lost.  Still, even for those who are looking more for the bird's eye view of the events, this is a great supplement to help one understand what was happening on the ground.
B000002N2P|5.0|This was exactly everything the fans didn't want to hear.  Green Day voiced their opinions loud with Insomniac.  They said to a public \\"We're not the sell-outs, you are.\\"  But, all politics aside, this was was still an amazing record and remains my favorite among not only most \\"pop-punk\\" records but also among the Green Day catalogue.  To put it simply, this is what Dookie should have been and what Nimrod wouldn't be.  It was much more aggressive and in your-face and straight to the point.  It had attitude but with purpose and conviction.  It was incredible, like Green Day was and still is.  It showed the truth about the band, the grittiness and hopelessness.  They had been assigned a label by the public but unlike bands like Nirvana, which spiraled into a self-sucidial rampage as a result of their fame (literally), Green Day did the unexpected.  They released an angry album.  This confused new fans and ostracized old fans because it was a completely different direction.  It wasn't happy go lucky and the cynically funny approach was nixed.  These guys were pissed.  When Nimrod (their follow-up effort) was released, it was clear the band had accepted their new-found popularity but not before this monster of an album was unleashed.  This is Green Day raw.  Here you will find their inner-most anger which created a self-expression in art form like no other and made me a fan for life. Thank you Green Day.
0782008372|4.0|After hearing several reviews of dvd versions of the film I was terrified to purchase any but went with it anyhow.  I'm a film freak as well but the quality of the release is acceptable.  Its not like they filmed movies back then with crystal clear High Def cameras with 7.1 speaker setups in mind!  And who knows what the requirments are for a full digital restoration.  You've got to cut it some slack considering the time and budget it was filmed on.<br /><br />  I didnt see it in the theatre so I can't make version comparisons but it is just like I remember seeing it on tv as a kid(minus a scene or two).  Its a bit goofy, but its no goofier than any film from that period or any worse quality.<br /><br />  If you remember it from way when or are another Sean Connery fan, go with it, its worth the couple bucks.  If you've never seen it then dont get it with expectations of it holding up to this years films.  Overall worth what I paid!!

1582701709|5.0|A great tape to teach people about manisfestation.  Many teachers have been talking about this for a long time, including Dr. Wayne Dyer.  It is good that it is reaching so many people.  A man is what he thinks, is the basic message and is very powerful.
B00005JPG1|4.0|Excellent performances all around - a superbly acted and directed film. It was easy to believe that this was, indeed, a \\"police procedureal\\" from the 70s because everything from set design to costume design was right on target. <br /> <br />While this wasn't meant to be a thriller, it could have benefited from a quicker pace. There were times where it felt like a two hour and forty minute film. I think we're seeing some of that in the box office receipts, which haven't been impressive. (As of this weekend, it's third, the film hasn't grossed $30m, and cost $85m to make). <br /> <br />But it's difficult to make a movie about a serial killer when the identity of the serial killer isn't known, and isn't likely to be known. Well more than half of the fun in a film of this type is capturing the bad guy. When you toss that out, all you have left is trying to find the bad guy, and making your best guess. Not that this made Zodiac a bad film by any stretch,
B000NA28IE|1.0|Can you say GODAWFUL script - did the screenwriter (and I use the term loosely) even bother to read the book?  Certainly not the book I read.  Can you say GODAWFUL costumes?  Cheap, cheap, cheap...just shoot me now.  And how about that painted red sword, folks?  Can you say GODAWFUL casting?  Oddly enough, I thought Ed Speleers was pretty good, considering his overall lack of prior experience.  The camera loves him, he has a great voice, one you don't expect to come out of that beautiful face, and he'll learn.  Jeremy Irons, one of my favorite actors and arguably one of the best still living, would have been much better as Galbatorix.  Can you say GODAWFUL John Malkovich?  Did anybody notice his non-British/Scottish accent?  Djmon Hounsou, bad.  Robert Carlyle, another fabulous actor, miscast here I think.  And Rachel Weiz, a fine actress, was totally the wrong voice for Saphira.  Did they think they were making a cartoon?  And don't get me started on Fangmeir - he shouldn't be allowed to direct traffic.  And if he was a former \\"special effects\\" whiz, I have two words for him:  Weta Workshop.  Let's hope we all live long enough to see Peter Jackson do the remake.  All things considered, is it any wonder it died at the box office.  Poor Christopher Paolini.  He dreamed of Eragon as a film and what he (and we) got was a bad cartoon with no guts, heart or soul, all of which can be found abundantly in the books.  And for anyone who wonders what Saphira should sound like, try listening to the books on DVD or casette.  Not the same guy who does the Harry Potter books on tape, but still great and the definitive Saphira. <br /> <br />In the end, though I hate to repeat myself, it all comes down to the script.  And this one positively sucked.  Hopefully, with the bad box office showing, they won't want to make Eldest.  Or if they do, hopefully they (the producers, the cheap cretins) have PJ's cell phone number. <br /> <br />By the way, I only gave it one star because zero wasn't an option.
B000C20VT6|5.0|This is possibly the best sci-fi/Action movie of all time.<br /><br />After the presedent's plane crashes into New York City, which is now a prison due to America crime rate too high, he is held hostage and the government calls on Snake Pliskin to get him out, or Snake will die.<br /><br />The movie on the PSP is still great as it is now in high definition format, which looks fantastic.<br /><br />You would have to be an idiot not to have this movie, but a true respector of this movie should have this for the PSP, if they have one.

0141023384|5.0|I don't even feel worthy enough to write a review for this novel. It is the greatest work of literature to have come out of Nigeria and perhaps even the entire African continent and one of the most brilliant pieces of fiction in the world. It has somehow become staple reading English literature for all levels of Nigerian education and the unattainable standard by which subsequent indigenous literature is judged by.    The plot revolves around Okonkwo; a physically and materially powerful member of his village, his family, the entire village as a whole and how Okonkwo (representative of Iboland as a whole) reacts when forcibly faced with colonization.     This book deliciously tells the tale of a lost world and the way Chinua Achebe handles the psychological aspects of his tale is pure genius especially that breaking moment in time when the old is violently juxtaposed against the new and a mad, sad confusion sets in.    I like that this book affords me the opportunity of interacting with a culture I should be acclimated with but I am unfortunately too removed from.    A must read for any person who indulges in [socio-political] classic literature (Dickens, Orwell, Shakespeare etc) . Chinua Achebe is an undisputed master at this game.
B000NA28I4|5.0|Others have said it and I will, too: this movie will make you feel like a kid again!    The challenge of adapting a world as rich as Chris Paolini's Alagaesia to screen will likely leave literary fans disappointed; the theatrical release takes notable liberties with the plot and lacks the depth and character development found in the book. Likewise, lofty film critics and fantasy aficionados that watch this PG-Rated film with high expectations will likely scoff at some fantasy clichés and \\"forced\\" plot and character development.    All and all, however, the movie is a thrilling, fast-paced fantasy adventure with stunning visuals and plenty of action. As long as you don't watch it expecting to see a \\"Lord of the Rings\\"-caliper genre piece, you're sure to find it thoroughly enjoyable and have a lot of fun!

B00000F169|3.0|...that I actually thought this movie was great. <br /> <br />But I got it on DVD and now I realize that it's a collection of: <br /> <br />pedantic political humor, much of it anti-military <br />cheap costumes and sets <br />a slow-moving plot that never really gets to a point <br />mediocre dialog delivered too fast without convincing emotion <br />a beach ball alien <br /> <br /> <br />Special effects-wise, I am amazed at what Carpenter and O'Bannon accomplished on a non-existent budget.

B000B8QEYC|3.0|I hate to say this, but Enya has run out of things to say. Even to the point that Roma Ryan has made up a fictional language to burble about. \\"Amarantine\\" is something you've heard before, and often. Even if it takes Enya five years between albums, you get the vague impression that this was what you just listened to.<br /><br />Darn shame that. The billowing clouds of multi-Enya's singing like a blissed out choir were what made her great. There was no-one else out there that made songs anything like \\"Orinoco Flow\\" or \\"Storms In Africa.\\" But we're talking almost 20 years ago, and \\"Amarantine\\" just sounds like warmed over material. The songs all waft and drift, and instead of inspiring bliss...they just vanish. Only the generic ballad \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" sounds like it could transcend the album we're listening to, because this all just runs into itself, like cotton candy fluff for aging new-agers.<br /><br />Maybe it was too much to expect that Enya and her collaborators could maintain brilliance forever. But like sonic architect Enigma (or even going back to The Alan Parsons Project), eventually the striking original becomes the banal. Unfortunately, that is what we have with \\"Amarantine.\\"
6302860253|5.0|This 1983 version of Bizet's Carmen, directed by the great Italian filmmaker, Franco Zeferelli, is wonderfully done.  We really don't see enough of the great soprano, Julia Migenes, who is seen here as the title character, opposite the marvelous Placido Domingo, as Don Jose, her jealous lover.  This film glows with exhuberance and fire and the cast does a fantastic job.  I definitely reccomend this film to those who consider themselves opera fans, as well as those who have never seen an opera before.  For starters, the cinematography is so earthy and beautiful to look at.  Secondly, the acting is best-described as smouldering.  Julia Migenes and Placido Domingo have great on-screen chemistry.  Finally, this opera has some of the most well-loved and recognized operatic songs ever heard.  Not to be missed.....
0553381342|5.0|Tantalizingly fascinating, The Bonfire of the Vanities is a deeply detailed and yet enthralling account of the entwining ways in which the forces of opportunistic politics, ugly racism, greedy Wall Street, gullible public sentiments, sinister profit motive and compelling lust interacted in New York City of 1980's. It is an outstanding work of fiction so vividly depicted and so richly crafted that you might feel yourself in the middle of action. The author's creativity with words and ideas while narrating very plausible events and developments adds remarkable color and candor to the plot. Phrases such as `laboratory of human relations', `big breasted eyes', and \\"master of universe', are so apt in their effect that you find yourself longing for more.<br /><br />At the script level, The Bonfire of the Vanities is a tragedy of a Wall Street bonds trader whose sheer misfortune causes his downfall though he does not endear himself to the readers by his philandering and vain ways that he feels he is entitled too. It also is the tragedy of an unfortunate black boy who gets killed for no fault of his, of a spouse whose only fault is that she has aged the best way she could and a 6 year old girls who `loses' her father to bizarre sequences of New York life. At a broader plane though, The Bonfire of the Vanities is the tragedy of the `Greatest City on the Planet', a city that has scaled every possible height and yet whose inhabitants have not overcome even the very basic vices that plague the human race. Powered by the avarice for lust, weaved around the gluttony for pride, fired by the envy of the have not's and the wrath of the racially deprived, New York is tortured by the sloth of conscience. Rarely has this tragedy been better depicted than in this landmark novel.
B0000844M8|5.0|Born Free was a great story for kids of all ages! I feel like this is something that really brought the family together. You dont find anymore very family friendly movies.   <br /> <br />The greatest thing about this movie is that it is based on a true story.
B000LAZDQA|3.0|Films that deal primarily with sex are quite plentiful but there's usually a weakened knowledge of the film in the general media. Aside from the controversy it'll raise over the explicitness of the scenes, most movies barely get attention other than people wanting to check out a hot actor or actress do something naughty. One of the few to get attention outside of the sex was Shortbus, directed by John Cameron Mitchell who did Hedwig and the Angry Inch. So how's the film as a whole? Well it's not as great as everyone says it is. I like the approach and idea behind it; I just wish there was a better movie attached to it.  <br /> <br />The film's central character is Sofia, a sex-therapist or self-proclaimed \\"couples counsellor\\" who has never had an orgasm despite having a rather energetic sex life. A couple she sees, and other central characters are Jamie and James, a gay couple who want to expand their relationship and make it more open. They refer her to \\"Shortbus\\", a club for people looking to advance their sexual experiences. She also meets Severin, a dominatrix who finds it hard to connect with others. All of the characters have to connect to each other and figure out just what they need. <br /> <br />Of course, I must first address the sex. Unlike some unrated/NC-17 films that are just clearly oversensitive ratings board members, this film truly earns its rating. There is so much graphic sex, I was wondering if hardcore filmmakers decided to get all \\"arty\\" on us. Some of it works while others (such as the strangest Star Spangled Banner performance ever) is funny but then some is just unbelievably unnecessary (such as a character who basically self-fellates). It's of course a movie about sex but after awhile it just feels like they put it in since they got away with other scenes, what else can they do? To the filmmakers credit though, as was mentioned later in the commentary, the sex gets less graphic the further into the film we get and development characters get. On that level, it's a good balance and not just using sex as a shock value. <br /> <br />Main thing is of course the acting. Well, they're pretty good with one looking like a throwback to Ziggy Stardust era David Bowie, a really tattooed (but quite beautiful woman) to a character who almost seems to just basically cry a lot. I'm not really knocking the performances but they just don't really stand out amongst everyone else. The only one who does is Sook-Yin Lee but that's because, being Canadian, I grew up watching her be a MuchMusic VJ. As far as the story is concerned, well, at times it just seemed kind of slow. It's a short movie (90 minutes) but some scenes almost seem to just keep going and going and it would've been nice if some were at least cut down a tad. <br /> <br />Some will love it because it takes a realistic viewpoint into sex and shows it as a human experience rather than this thing we have to downplay while others hate it for what the film is or just what it didn't do. I'm in the latter partly because the topic was fine, but the execution missed the mark.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Anyone watching this movie can't help but fall in love with it (I mean who out there doesn't love chocolate or Johnny Depp for that matter). <br /> <br />A must see, you won't be disappointed! <br />
B000M4RG42|2.0|Director Clint Eastwood's adaptation of James Bradley's &#34;Flags of Our Fathers&#34; makes the fatal error of jettisoning the book's linear structure. This ambitious Iwo Jima saga goes all over the map with its excessive flashbacks and cross-cutting distractions, thus keeping the audience at arm's length. Ryan Phillippe, Adam Beach and Barry Pepper try to rise above the narrative quagmire, but it's a losing battle. The film's artistic failure can be attributed to Eastwood's astonishing lack of focus — he never seems fully engaged in the source material. By striking contrast, the more-intimate &#34;Letters From Iwo Jima&#34; is better aligned with his directorial skill.
B00005JPLU|5.0|I have tremendous respect for Frank Miller, having been exposed to his reimagining of Batman at an early age. Miller infused Batman with mature dignity, heavy with grief over what he was doing but doing it anyway.  No wonder, then, that the tale of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae appealed to him enough to create a graphic novel.<br /><br />I've heard that comics were originally movie story boards that someone decided to sell, so it's no wonder that, when the director has respect for Miller's material (as Robert Rodriguez did with Sin City), the end result is nothing short of breathtaking.  But there's a lot of ego and a lot of money in Hollywood, and it takes a clear-minded director to subsume his own inclinations and stay true to Miller's material. Zack Snyder follows in Rodriguez's footsteps and the end result...<br /><br />Well the end result was a theater packed with kids, who, five minutes into the film, become utterly silent.<br /><br />The movie's plot is somewhat beside the point.  300's really an experience, not a movie. It's everything cool about Gladiator's war against the barbarian tribes, everything amazing about Achilles' fighting style and six-pack abs in Troy, all the special effects of Clash of the Titans brought up to date for the modern age, everything terrifying about the villain from Stargate, and a whole heap of the Lord of the Rings' saber rattling wrapped up into one glorious, bloody fight to the death.<br /><br />Squeamish about gore?  This movie is not for you. 300 doesn't just show you death, it rolls around in it and makes it beautiful.  Limbs, heads, entrails...all of it spatters and smears on screen.<br /><br />Don't like violence?  This movie is not for you. 300 kills and kills and kills, and when the bodies are heaped so high that you can make a wall out of them, it kills everybody else too.<br /><br />Machismo annoys you?  This movie is not for you.  Men joke as they skewer their helpless enemies, make fun of Athenian \\"boy lovers,\\" and keep a running murder tally for who can rack up the most kills.  Gimli and Legolas would be jealous.<br /><br />Want to be politically correct?  This movie is not for you.  300 is a retelling of a Greek war from the perspective of the Greeks.  Persians are the enemy, and they are demonized in every way imaginable, both figuratively (the Immortals wear demonic masks) and literally (yep, that's a goat-headed monster playing the flute).<br /><br />300 is about a leader and his 299 best friends standing to the last to do what's right, to bow to no man when every logic dictates otherwise, to die for king and yes, country because history will remember you as a hero.  Back when we remembered what heroes were. And you find yourself cheering, because this is how many men secretly wish they could die...not in a hospital, not walking across the street, but with a sword in their hand and piles of enemies at their feet.<br /><br />I loved the movie.  My brother loved the movie.  My sister-in-law loved the movie.  My pregnant wife loved the movie too.<br /><br />And the other 296 kids in the audience?

B000N4SHPS|3.0|I don't know where Anthony C is getting his information, but everyone I know loves Rocky 5. Anyway, on to Rocky 6. <br /> <br />While it's absolutely great to revisit the old character, Rocky Balboa leaves a lot to be desired. I read that originally Adrian was included in the script but in the end he wanted Rocky to lose almost everything so the character would appear as desperate and lost as possible. I really think a much better way to do that would have been to include her in the first of the movie, go through the cancer with her and then to lose her, instead of her just not being there. We never got to see Balboa's pain of losing her, and to me that is a major drawback. <br /> <br />Mason and Steps are extremely poorly developed, and both of these \\"actors\\" have absolutely no acting skill whatsoever. A cardboard standup could have played either of their roles. Stallone should have developed steps a bit more, and chosen a boxer with more character to play Mason. I found these two characters extremely flawed. <br /> <br />I also seriously questioned the ability of Rocky to run a successful business, negotiate in the marketplace and make any money. I mean, this is a guy who couldn't read \\"smell manly\\" in the commercials he tried to do in Rocky 2, now he's a business man? Someone would either be robbing him blind or he'd be bankrupt with his level of intelligence. So for me, to say that he was running a business was a little far fetched unless it's a boxing gym or something, which would have been a much better choice for the character. <br /> <br />Stallone himself even seems tired in this film. He never really laughs, and even his jokes seem tired. I know he's lost everything, but who wants to see Rocky with almost no sense of humor, and never having a good time no matter what he does? <br /> <br />Having said all that, it is simply fantastic to revisit the character. I found myself very emotional when the Rocky theme started playing. At the end, realizing that thiswould be the last Rocky movie ever, I just sat still for a while. Not many movies have that sort of \\"punch.\\" <br /> <br />It was fantastic to see him really give the character a final send off. Production was good, camera work is awesome and I enjoyed the script for the most part. <br /> <br />After 16 years without a Rocky movie, I really feel that anything he did was bound to be a hit. I think people are overrating this movie because they aren't looking at it as a movie itself, but just thinking about how nice it is to revisit the character. <br /> <br />Rating the movie by itself, it's hard to give it more than three stars, and I am a HUGE Rocky fan.

0307237699|5.0|This book has been my segue into the political genre.  Barack Obama gives us insight to his perspective on past, present, and future political machinations, yet he doesn't lose the untested reader with a tirade of govenmental mumbo jumbo and partisan propaganda.

6305268843|5.0|I already made a comment on someone's review; so I'll try to keep this short.  This is one of my favorite films, absolutely beautiful and romantic.  Lovely music, fits the mood, and beautiful scene's.  I think all the actor's did a marvelous job; you truly believe their emotions.  I don't care whether the wife wouldn't have survived that long in the 1800's, and I don't care if the ice looked like styrofoam (as someone suggested) (it looked like ice to me - I never once didn't feel the cold water as the mother struggled to get to her daughter - it was very realistic in my mind.)   I give it an A+++.  Beautifully done; too bad there aren't more movies like this.   One point to remember to all the really picky reviewers:  In Shakespeare's day the women's parts were played by men, no-one cared about great accuracy.  The play was the thing!  You are supposed to use your heart and head and not just your eyes.  When you read a book there ususally aren't pictures (unless you're a child.)  I think technology has caused us to forget about our God-given imaginations and emotions.  This was a lovely romance.  I wish it were out in the U.S. too....
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I recieved this watch as a gift several months ago. The watch is very nice looking, much better looking in person. Mine hasn't had any issues with timekeeping, it's been very accurate. I haven't experienced the problems others have.  <br /> <br />The face of the watch is nearly impossible to scratch. There's been several times where I've accidently rubbed the face against a wall or other surface only to find no damage, much to my surprise. Other watches I've had scratch within the first week. I've had this watch for about 6 months and have no face scratches (although around the face and on the band show many scratches, not nearly as annoying as a scratch right on the face). I'm serious, I like to party and the face is still scratchless. This is very surprising to me. <br /> <br />The chronograph functions are almost entirely useless, but who cares. A stopwatch without fractions of a second is not worth using, but with this watch the features are more for looks, and they look great. I don't find this to be a big deal since I would rather not have digital functions on my watch, they look tacky in my opinion. Also my cell phone has a great stop watch funtion which I use for 12 ounce beer chug time trials making this complaint almost inconsiquential. <br /> <br />The movement of the watch leaves a little to be desired. The japaneese movement is somewhat jumpy. At this price you really can't expect an automatic movement however. This is really the biggest weak point of the watch and if you have a bunch of cash burning a hole in your pocket, maybe you should get a swiss automatic movement watch. This is a somewhat minor issue given almost all watches in this price range use japanees movements no normal person will ever know the difference. <br /> <br />This watch is about the same price as a cheap fossil watch but when you see it in person it feels and looks much more expensive. The fit and finish is much more than you would expect for $115. I find it to be a great value.The box it comes in is so nice you don't want to throw it away, I still have mine. I wear this watch every day I still recieve compliments on it.

0618551050|5.0|Ah, deep breath...<br /><br />Every once in a (long) while you read a book that truly leaves you impressed.  This is one of those great books.  Smolin has crafted a great book that appeals onmany levels.<br /><br />First, his overview of the present state of physics is excellent.  Yes, there are still parts that boggle the mind of someone with a background in physics, but it is still highly understandable for those without the training.  He covers everything from Einstein onwards.<br /><br />Then there is his view on the foundational issues within physics.  Again, he really illustrates his view very well - clearly and without getting nasty.<br /><br />And finally we have the personal story.  This really makes the book what it is - imagine, a physicist who can express his feelings.  The sectionabout Freyeraband was great.<br /><br />My only gripe, a small one, is that he forgot a few people who have made very valuable contributions.  He mentions Holger Bech Neilsen's latest theory but there is no mention of Prigogine.  Where is entropy in fundamental physics these days?  And, although I hate to inflate his ego, Wolfram should be here.  His book was not very good but his basic idea fits very well with the concept of random dynamics...<br /><br />Anyway, you should read this...
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album was a little on teh down side due to all the off collard songs. There are four good songs on this CD, which isn't as impresive as IOWA which had more like six. Its still a great CD but for me it was a millimeter dropback. this is not there best CD, but I have to say this is pretty impressive.  <br /> <br />The best song I would have to say is a debate between duality, and the blister exsists. Iowa is still the best CD.
B000LXHK22|4.0|First I watched this movie I didn't pay too much attention to it but when I saw those bueatiful scenery I bought the movie for myself. <br />Second time I watched \\"A Good Year\\" - I enjoyed it. It is romantic , easy to watch. I like it.
1579125549|5.0|Board visualization can be achieved and mastered through daily use of this book.  When you have gone through the examples in a progressive manner, mate-in-ones, twos, threes, etc, you start to develop an appreciation for and realize the necessity to analyze moves out beyond one or two steps.  If you are going to get good, you simply must be able to do this.  Sometimes my head literally gets hot from racking my brains trying to figure out some of the solutions, but it is necessary.  The problems WILL get easier with time and your game WILL improve.  No one said 'good' Chess was easy; but this book, taken with the right attitude and realization that it will take years to finish it, will certainly improve your game and your ability to focus.

It also lets you know how to use it and how you have been using it throughout your life.  Unless you are perfect you should read this book.
B000NA28A2|5.0|Luego de oirse un poco forzado en su ultimo disco \\"Para ti\\", donde el gospel y las baladas acusticas eran el plato para canciones no tan memorables, Juan Luis Guerra vuelve a lo que sabe hacer mejor: a crear temas que se meten dentro de la piel y quedan sonando en la cabeza. Altamente melodico, ritmico, y viendo hacia el futuro mientras por momentos abraza sus raices. Juan Luis aqui inventa con ritmos nuevos, con samples, y hasta con canciones en ingles sin perder lo que lo identifica y tanto nos gusta, algo que se habia olvidado un poco en \\"Para ti\\".  Para todos los fans de ahi afuera, este es un must-have.  Tendran la musica en la cabeza y en los pies por mucho tiempo.

0743496728|3.0|I should first say that I haven't yet finished the book...I'm only about half way through (after about a day.)  I love Jodi Picoult and have read several of her novels.  I am really enjoying this one as well, but I do have an issue with some of the little \\"stories\\" within it.  I understand that this is suppose to be similar to Columbine, but it is obviously not suppose to BE ABOUT Columbine.  However, several parts of the novel come right out of incidents that occured at Columbine.  They are smaller incidents that most people don't know about or maybe have forgotten.  I feel a little cheated by this, like Jodi Picoult is trying to pass off some of those intimate stories as her own.  Other than that, very good so far and I look forward to finishing it (tonight??)
B000005HLV|5.0|If you're into extreme metal you seriously need to check this album out. It's totally unique and among the darkest metal records of all time. A true classic.
B000H5TVO4|4.0|I say \\"probably the best Swedish pop/rock band besides ABBA\\" because I can't say I know a lot about Swedish music. However, I rate ABBA as one of the all time great bands, and probably the best pop group of all time [I rate The Beatles as the best group of all time and value them for their really weird songs...which aren't particularly pop]...so for Roxette to be compared favourably to them is a big call on my part.       Probably the main reason I bought this compilation was for the song \\"Fading like a flower\\". On the odd occasions I've heard this song, I've really enjoyed it. Listening to it for the first time on cd here, I can't say that it grabbed me as much as it did back then. However, before I listened to this cd all the way through, I must have listened to this song around a dozen times, which says a lot for me. I've been listening to it repeatedly since I've listened to the whole cd too. This song is back as an all time great pop classic in my estimation...up there with ABBA's best songs, and songs like: \\"What have I done to deserve this?\\" by the Pet Shop Boys and Dusty Springfield; \\"Clocks\\" by Coldplay; \\"Do they know it's Christmas\\" by Band Aid; \\"Our lips are sealed\\" by The Go Gos; and, from Australia, \\"Chemistry\\" by Mondo Rock and \\"Green\\" by Alex Lloyd.       Roxette, apart from being very melodic and catchy popsters, have a harder rock sound than ABBA in their songs. So, in songs like \\"Fading like a flower\\" you get a very cool keyboard melody introducing the song, followed by a momentary rock power chord. The chorus to this song is great and the verses are nice too. The song also features some nice changes of pace and cool guitar rhythym in that slow part as well a really nice lead guitar there too.        The other song that I tend to play a lot, though not nearly as much as \\"Fading like a flower\\" is \\"Dressed for success\\". It features a cool rock guitar sound, catchy chorus and some cool drums.        Another song I quite like is \\"Dangerous\\". This is yet another catchy melody song which Roxette are so good at. Usually the female half of Roxette does all the singing, but here the male half has his share of lines. Hadn't really noticed the weird outro to this song before-the man sings some barely intelligible words.       Rest assured that the rest of the album is chock full of catchy pop/rock, which I won't delve into too much, suffice to say that Americans might rate some of Roxette's ballads higher than I do...songs like \\"Listen to your heart\\" which isn't a fave of mine and \\"It must have been love\\", which I wasn't expecting to like but on hearing it here it did have a lyrical charm to it.        As for the rest, I'll just mention songs that had me relating them to songs by other artists, e.g. something else that Roxette has in common with ABBA is songs with daggy lyrics, these would include: \\"Joyride\\", \\"Spending my time\\" [more so for mediations on relationships than being daggy], \\"Almost unreal\\" [back to dag central here]. \\"A thing about you\\" also features one of those trippy effects that The Beatles were so fond of. It's in the intro of this song whereas The Beatles liked to use stuff like this for outros.       Other songs which remind me of other artists: \\"How do you do\\" [The Beatles' version of \\"Twist and shout\\" can be heard in this song]; \\"Crash! Boom! Bang!\\" [Dusty Springfield]; \\"The centre of the heart\\" [Savage Garden]; and \\"Run to you\\", which had a guitar vibe which reminded me of Weddings, Parties, Anything's song \\"Monday's experts\\", which is, granted, more of a stretch for Roxette to have been influenced by.       The songs towards the end of this cd are not the kind of pop/rock that fills most of the preceding tracks. Best examples of that are \\"Crash! Boom! Bang!\\" and \\"Wish I could fly\\". The latter has a nice mellow, cool vibe to it. \\"Stars\\" is also a more dance orientated song...it features a trippy intro and tinny techno beat.       Another thing to recommend this band are that they widen themusical instruments that they use, e.g. instruments that sound like music box pianos, organs, steel string guitars and violins.        If you like catchy pop songs, you should love this album, so long as you don't mind the band's forays into rock for entire songs or parts of songs.    P.S. One possible criticism of this cd is that it, according to the sleeve notes, I think, does NOT have some of Roxette's songs which charted in Europe. On the upside, the new songs on this cd are surprisingly good...I mean they are not classics, but they are much better than you would expect such new songs lumped together into a best of compilation to be.       I did neglect to mention perhaps Roxette's biggest hit, The Look. Whilst this song has many good hooks/elements to it, the lyric \\"tasted like a raindrop\\", sung about a woman, remains a hurdle for me liking this song better! I.e. it sounds a rather naff lyric!    If you like this cd, you might want to read my reviews of other albums with a good pop sensibility, e.g.    Midnight Oil for masterful pop/rock. Politics never sounded so good.  Alex Lloyd-Amazing: The Best Of  The Go Gos  Red Hot Chilli Peppers  Skyhooks  INXS
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|3.5 stars.  The most striking thing about this picture is that it's beautiful to look at.  Kudos for the cinematopgraphy and even the film's direction.  I wasn't too fond of the pacing.  On more than one occasion, I found myself twitching in my seat and wanting everyone to get one with it.  Norton's performance was exceptional as his character carries an air of superiority throughout the film.  The overly typecast Sewell, once again don the role of the villian (I think it has something to do with his eyes-he just looks like a bastard, doesn't he?)  But the man I continue to be impressed with is Paul Giamatti.  Will someone please give this man an Oscar already.  The way this man can change his whole demeanor, his voice and delivery is absolutely amazing.  Don't believe me: Watch Sideways/Cinderella Man/ The Illusionist back to back and you'll see what I mean.  Overall: This is a film worth your time.
B000KGGLCU|4.0|Great concert. The songs and dance routines were full of energy. Top notch.
0618680004|1.0|A great book, IF your religion is atheism. Dawkins is a hardcore leftist atheist, who's stated goal is to have every \\"faith head\\" (believer) read his book and put it down a converted athiest. Nice.     Dawkins has a religion too, it's called atheistic science. He claims faith in science is not necessary, as it can be empirically proven through \\"skepticism, investigation and evidence.\\" God, in contrast, requires faith because it cannot be proven and is the direct opposite of his \\"science,\\" which is therefore better. For all his academic credentials, Dawkins appears the roughian in the playground, spouting \\"my religion can beat up your religion.\\" None of this is very new. For years athiests have been attacking the bible and christianity for being false, cruel, abusive, and self-contradictory. God is a madman who demands blood and more blood. To this schtick Dawkins adds a spit-shine of 21st century science in the fields of genetics, microbiology and astronomy. Still, it's the same mixed bag, with or without his spit on it.    This book is soul food for those who tend to see christians as moronic, closed-minded bigots and/or moral hypocrites. But this book itself is rife with bigotry and patronizing contempt for the very people he claims to want to convert. To Dawkins, atheism is more moral, just, and humane than religion, yet he can't even show affection for his audience. What does THIS tell you about a world where we trade Mother Theresa for a cheese-eating athiest college professor? Sign me up! We could one day surpass the compassion and humanity of non-religious societies like red China and the Soviet Union. Can't wait...    Now, to dispatch with religion, we have to have a new basis for understanding the universe, and this is where science takes center stage. The science of Dawkins that can't predict the weather in 2 days, can't explain religious stigmata, couldn't help Christopher Reeve - proudly and unabashedly says to throw away religion, because it has all theanswers. You and I, you see, are nothing but space dust, elegantly configured, come to life, dancing naked in a vegetable-filled garden of eden, orbiting our sun in the most privileged spot in the solar system. Um, ok, I'm convinced.     Entertaining for sure, but this book earns only one star for several reasons, the least not being its total arrogance to pronounce as \\"concluded\\" the ultimate issues of the universe with such flimsy argumentation. Smart guy, but arguing isn't really Dawkins' thing. He made a DVD that entirely cut footage of an intelligent debater of his, and tends to go on interviews alone, or in safe environments. But he's eating it up all the same as the new Boy King of the anti-Jesus crowd. It's this sheltered arrogance which dooms his book; without fully engaging his critics he taunts them nonetheless. Allow me to list its offenses in no particular order, and by no means is this exhaustive:    1 - Level of proof of argument - Science is science, and religion is religion, and never the 'twain shall meet. What religion is lacking in empirical evidence, it makes up for in coherence. Science is the opposite, it demands testing and objective validation, but its domain of settled proof is quite small when compared to the task answering the basic questions of man's existence in the universe. Sure, we know a few things, for example, we know how photosynthesis works, that electrons are quite small, and that light travels pretty fast. But science is quite incapable of grasping the origins of the universe, despite its many attempts to do so. And science knows quite a lot less than this, simple biological processes and physical everyday forces still vex it. Heck, we still can't figure out the Northern Lights. If anything, this shows that science ought to stick to what it does best; proving what it can be empirically tested. When it wanders beyond its natural boundaries of thoerem, proof and validation, science has very little to say to us at all. Cast adrift to wash up on the shore of religious belief, it is naked and devoid of speech. In Dawkins hands, evolutionary science becomes the ventriliquist dummy on his lap, lamely parroting theorems that are as far away from becoming fact as another doll was of becoming a real boy.    To claim to employ science to tackle the creation of matter and the universe is like employing a person to perform \\"flight of the bumblebee\\" after his first piano lesson. It is simply too much, it is beyond his grasp. Science has made some stabbing attempts to explain ultimate questions of existence, but it has a looooong way to go.     2 - Dawkins makes a fatal logical error by confusing the impossible with the unexplainable. Because he cannot conjure the \\"science\\" to reconcile the physical manifestation of God, it cannot, by definition, exist. Though one could find the imprint of God in a delicious meal, a meteor shower or a lamborghini, Dawkins and his kind turn their nose at such nonsense. This leaves them no choice but to believe that this amazingly complex universe and the creatures such as ourselves that inhabit it and gaze upon it with awe and wonder are nothing more than highly organized space dust. This leaves a step or two behind religion, because religion must only reconcile the mystery of God, while the science of Dawkins must reconcile 1) what caused the space dust; 2) how this dust organized itself into a mind bogglingly organized system which anyone reading this happens to be experiencing... now, and now, and now, and 3) why this space dust would - upon taking a human form - uniformly throughout its species fabricate the existence of some supreme being that is clearly false. If our existence was pre-ordained by the space dust, surely then too was our evolution to form institutions to foster belief in God. If Dawkins is such a strong proponent of evolution, why is he trying to divert its path by converting us to atheism? Like Dawkins, I digress...    To further illustrate his flawed concept of man and belief, I'd like to see Dawkins transported back 1,000 years to the past, and attempt to inform the people of this time of the reality of space travel, computers, and mass-produced charcoal. The fact that his audience would be so utterly resistant to believing him - and understandably so - would not diminish the truthfulness of his description. To our ancestors, modern advances would seem incomprehensible as well as impossible, but they would only be correct on one account, since we know these things to exist. The point then is to avoid what Dawkins relies on most in this book, namely concluding that that which is beyond our comprehension must be non-existent or false. But as just shown, such a position is neither scientifically supported, or even very reliable.  Which brings me to...    3 - Substantively confusing science and religion. Dawkins uses scientific arguments to discredit and attack various aspects of belief, much as a skeptic may dig in the dirt to show that the lack of fossil evidence disproves the existence of unicorns. Religion could not by any possible definition - whether in our current culture or in a shinto hut 3,000 years ago - be something whose phenomena can be ascertained or explained in a scientific context. Sure, there are some things that employ a level of proof, such as aracheological evidence of the life of a prophet, or the occurrence of a physical miracle, but the tautaulogy should be clear enough; God is God, and he is not science, nor can proof of him be secured by same.     Yet the arguments for the universe and evolution are not offered as interesting theories, but as definitive and authoritative, and it's here where Dawkins especially bullies the reader. He starts by co-opting evolution as a cornerstone of atheism, which itself is a leap of faith. Who says God didn't create or sustain the proof indicating evolution? To Dawkins, modern man is so tied in his view to the continuum of evolution, God falls through your fingers like sand. Setting aside the holes in evolutionary theory which are not a matter of debate, is it not feasible that a deity could (or should) keep the keys of enlightenment just outside the grasp of our fingertips? Could there be anything more ridiculous than a god who could be completely comprehended by us mere mortals using the physical laws that he himself provided us? Again, this is not to stand as a proof of God, but as a plausible counterweight to the theories that Dawkins posits that are themselves incomplete. Should we bow to science when it too - like God - hides mysteries from us?    4 - Dawkins is annoying, needlessly harsh, and demeaning to believers. He ought to know you don't prove the compassion of your mindset by practicing hostility toward the people you hope to convert. He's a bad salesman, and probably ultimately counter-productive to his cause. For all our faults, believers at least clutch to the straws of salvation for humanity. If Dawkins can't offer the same through his attempt at illuminating our minds to the ultimate \\"truths\\" as he sees them then to what purpose is this book written? A truth to be shared on behalf of a world for which he feels contempt strongest of all?    5 - Dawkins mischaracterizes his opponents, needlessly, and consistently. Let me just touch on the most obvious one, that believers are oblivious to change and refuse to accept scientfic principles. Gimme a break, even the Vatican accepts certain aspects of evolution, as did GK Chesterton and most contemporary theologists. On issues of theology, he ought to join a bible study group. To say that people are closed minded or incapable of debate (which is implied, not stated verbatim) is to ignore the vigorous intellectual debates that rage among, between, and through religious communities. Science can always accept the \\"truth\\" of gravity, but change and modify its position on its cause and nature, just as christianity can agree in the fundamental truth of the divinity, yet still qualify its meaning on earth. If Dawkins cannot understand a basic truth concerning those whom he attacks, then that shows perhaps he must argue more forcefully to get to a place his own evidence cannot carry him.     6 - Failure to tackle the most compelling reasons for belief. Disbelievers and anti-clerics have been around since Jesus broke in his first pair of sandals, but many have had the honesty to submit to certain points. The miracles of Lourdes, Fatima, Cork, Guadalupe (from my own Catholic background) were witnessed by thousands upon thousands in some cases. Even those who wished to stop the gatherings personally wrote accounts of miracle apparitions, as well as the accuracy of various prophesies provided to whom we would call today, the \\"mentally challenged.\\" Healings, miracles, apparitions, and supernatural powers that defy anything \\"scientific\\" are always conveniently avoided by the science gods. Yet they have fueled conversions of peoples and of nations for centuries. To Dawkins, these experiences would be nothing more than hopeful fantasies, rich ghost stories full of error and embellishment. But miraculous holy relics have escaped plausible explanation by science for hundreds of years to our present day of electron microscopes. If you want to use science to dismiss religion, let's start with something small, say stigmata in Padre Pio, the Shroud of Turin, or the tunic of Guadalupe. Let's get some closure on those before we tackle the equation for the beginning of time, space and matter, ok? Deal. I guess miracles and mass conversions are just part of the evolutionary process, eh Richard?    7 - Finally, Dawkins' overall hubris is crippling in its breadth. If his ideas were put forth to provoke debate, that would be one thing, and would likely benefit believers and disbelievers both. But Dawkins clearly set out to write an atheist treatise for his already non-converted choir of non-belivers. (Can I get an \\"amen\\" people? No??) His arguments are basically conclusions.     For example, only a stupid person could believe that some omniscient god exists, able to read billions of peoples' minds simultaneously and manage the universe down to the smallest quark. I mean, you'd HAVE to be stupid to believe that, just think how CRAZY it is! For Dawkins, that passes as an argument when it is nothing more than a conclusion stated on terms to dissuade the contemplation of any being in existence more advanced than man. For a person who believes that space dust made everything, THAT is a startling narrow and thin-skinned reaction to the possibilities of the universe.    Dawkins can think of God, he can look at his hand, or he can look at a grain of sand. He can stare at it for years, and he will not come any closer scientifically speaking, to making it clear to us why that grain of sand even exists in the universe, let alone is perceived, studied and contemplated by an enormously complex living creature situated on an enormously complex and unlikely planet. We are back to square 1, beyond science, in the realm of belief or disbelief. Science cannot tell us why people have depression, or are nostalgic for old music, or donate vital organs to loved ones. Dawkins and his crowd write books like \\"the god gene\\" and \\"the selfish gene\\" to state with authority that all of our humanity that makes us \\"human\\" is hardwired into us like a dog's love for bacon. But while they may grasp it, they still cannot explain it, not even conceptually. Are you telling me a single microscopic gene acts SELFISH, like a person? How odd, now can you tell me where it came from, or why an evolved being would want to become weepy upon hearing an old Johnny Ray record? Can they explain why every civilization on earth has been religious in one form or another?    Dawkins obvious intellect has strangled his intuition, causing a spiritual asphyxiation that renders him incapable of relating in an honest way to the subjects he hopes to persuade. If you are not already an atheist, then the reasons already in place for that fact are certainly enough to repel the nonsense and confusion in this book.    Which reminds me... My dog wants to get off his leash and run into traffic to chase a cat, but I don't let him. He is frustrated with me, incapable of understanding my imposed limitation, that my denial is an act of love. He cannot fathom where his dinner comes from, or that medicine is coursing through his body due to my intervention, or that he is known by people who have only seen his photo, or remembered by people whom he once sniffed. He cannot know this, yet it is all true, it is all real. Of course, this entirely transparent metaphor is intended to mock the atheists who believe they have amassed the firepower to empirically disprove God with science. Thier efforts fail before they begin, as they attempt to disprove that which cannot be disproven, even if it were false. The difference between the Dawkins and God is incomprehensibly bigger than the difference between my dog and me. I knew my dog was cuter, who knew that - relatively - he was smarter too.    Again, if you're an atheist, at least have the courage to admit it is a religion. You will be very happy with this book; yet another bible to throw on the pile. For those looking to the criticisms which Dawkins avoids or answers insincerely, have a look at \\"The Dawkins Delusion\\" by Oxford peer Alister McGrath, and \\"Deluded by Dawkins\\" by Andrew Wilson. I am sure there are others, but start there.

B000GIXEIG|1.0|I am a fan of Gerard Butler and waited with anticipation for this film to be released in the U.S., however upon viewing it I was very disappointed. <br />As one who has read and enjoyed Beowulf, the script and acting for this film was completly lack luster.  It dragged on endlessly and could not keep my attention at all.  It had very poor direction and editing.   <br />Too bad for Mr. Butler, it's not his fault.  He has real talent as well as fabulous looks and a shining personality.  It would be real nice if the film industry could recognize it and give him the roles he deserves with directors and editors that have some talent. <br />   <br />If you are interested in this movie for the story line of Beowulf, don't bother.  If you aren't familiar with \\"Beowulf\\" READ the myth, it really is a GREAT story.  Don't let this movie be your only exposure to it. <br /> <br />If you are interested in this movie because you are a Gerard Butler fan, don't bother with that either.

B0002XNSY0|5.0|I wanted to have a look at what folks had to say about this film. It's over 40 years <br />old, the Soviet Union no longer even exists. I wondered how people could find it relevant at all!  <br />Well, they do, and in great numbers. Many recall the cold war either <br />through parents, or from actually being there. Most love the performances.  <br />Either because they really do enjoy them, or know they should. Yeah, they really are funny. <br />Likely what made our parents laugh so was the nervousness. The film helped to dispel <br />the fear everyone felt. I think those who found it crass perhaps had an agenda for that <br />fear. Who knows? I find it interesting that people seem to celebrate the film. Those <br />of us who really enjoyed Stanley Kubrick will always love to see his work that way. <br />He was certainly a master of the craft.

Highly recommend to read it with the same fear and frustration that Grover is expressing.  Makes for lots of extra giggles.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I Personally haven't seen this show yet but I have seen previews to it on Dicsovery Channel. It's susposed to air starting March 28, 2007. It'll be a 11 part series. From what I've seen, the moments they've captured on video are very nice. I'll be buying this for my HD DVD collection. Watch the show on Discovery Channel then go get the DVD when it comes out.
B000FDECGA|5.0|Yes, it's recut, rewritten, rescored, dubbed, and chopped down from two separate films.  Yet even my Japanese friends agree: this version of \\"Lone Wolf and Cub\\" is better than the original Japanese films.  Here's why: <br /> <br />1)That fantastic score by Marc Lindsay (of Paul Revere & the Raiders fame), which absolutely blows away the original. <br /> <br />2) The brilliantly-written and witty script (\\"Those swine will butcher anyone who walks in their way!  It's just bad taste!\\").  The highlight is  the narration of Daigoro, which is not found in the original. <br /> <br />3) A really first-rate dub.  (Even Daigoro's pronunciation of \\"harakiri\\" is accurate.) <br /> <br />4) Wall to wall action!  This is truly the \\"good parts\\" version of \\"Sword of Vengeance\\" and \\"Baby Cart on the River Styx.\\" <br /> <br />5) Lone Wolf is actually a MUCH cooler customer in this version.  The American editors have gone through and carefully removed all of actor Tomisaburo Wakayama's over-the-top emotional reactions, creating virtually a new performance in the editing room.  This version of Lone Wolf is more self-possessed and calmly lethal than the original Japanese version. <br /> <br />That much said, there are two problems with Animeigo's presentation.  The lesser is the idiotic unremovable \\"unrestored\\" notice plastered over the opening shot of Himeji Castle, which could have been handled much less intrusively by a title card before the start of the film. <br /> <br />Far worse, though, is the image quality.  This version was constructed from Animeigo's transfers of the original films (also available on DVD), yet the picture quality is not nearly as sharp as the originals'.  It actually appears to be a generation down in quality.   After years of neglect and bootlegging, poor \\"Shogun Assassin\\" still can't get a break!
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Titanic is one of my favorite movies, and this special collector's edition is perfect for me- there is so much extra material. I highly recommend this product

0793518326|4.0|I was pretty anxious to receive this book after reading the reviews and ordering it. I had researched other Beatles song boks and publications for lyrics and music and found that the others were not as complete as I would like. \\"The Beatles - Complete Scores\\" (hard cover) has everything I was looking for and more: chords, lyrics, Tab, and music score - with one problem. The book is printed in a small type and is difficult to read. As I sit with a guitar in hand, the book at arms length, initial read-throughs are tough. The main advantage for me is that the book is 98% complete and accurate. I can work out the basics and, if need be, reproduce it at a larger scale. For all it contains, the somewhat compact size is helpful and the high construction and print quality will add many years of life to its use. (I would have rated it at 4.5 or 5 if not for the small print size.)
B000FVQYYK|3.0|I am a huge Muse fan, I own all their CDs (including this one) and most of their DVDs.  I was excited to hear that Muse was working on a new album and even more excited when I bought it. <br /> <br />After popping the CD into the player, I was astounded... Muse had totally changed.  No longer was this the same band that was playing Absolution, and Showbiz.  To me it seems that they gave in to pop culture and decided to produce an album that would make more money and get more listeners, rather than keep the listener/fan base they already have. <br /> <br />This CD is great if you are into pop music and the bubblegum crap, but if you truly appreciate Muse and *their* style of music, you will be disappointed with this CD. <br /> <br />If you are purchasing a Muse CD for the first time, start out with Absolution. That is probably their best album, although I like all their albums immensely and have a very hard time rating one above the other.  However, this album (Black holes & revelations) immediately gets pushed to the back of the Muse CD pile. <br /> <br />I still love Muse, and am looking forward to their next release whenever it may be, and I can only hope they'll turn away from the pop.
B000003TAR|5.0|If you are a fan of actual Alternative Rock (Not Pearl Jam, Staind, or any band that they play on \\"alternative\\" rock radio) you will be able to realize the amazing song writing that exists in this album.  There is a filler, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, but the album is much stronger, darker, displays more cobain-esque pain, and just plain more Nirvana than its predecessor Nevermind.  The songs are not poppy like Nevermind, but alternative rock isn't supposed to be.  Remember Grunge is like punk, hte key is to keep it simple, and alternative rock places much greater influence on artistic creativity and emotion rather than musicianship, which this album does beautifully. <br /> <br />Start out with the classics <br />Heart-Shaped Box-best Nirvana song <br />Rape Me <br />Pennyroyal Tea <br />Dumb <br />All Apologies <br /> <br />Move onto the more grungy stuff <br />Serve the Servants <br />Scentless Apprentice <br />Frances Farmer <br />Tourettes <br /> <br />Finally the songs that people who don't like alternative rock call \\"filler tracks\\" <br />Milk It <br />Very Ape <br />Radio Friendly unit shifter- I will admit this song is not the greatest, but hey an album this beautiful has to have at least one blemish. <br />
1416914285|5.0|The worst thing about most books is that they forget life is a comedy as well as a tragedy.<br /><br />City of Bones never does this. Through high-risk adventure and fairly serious trauma, the voice is always fresh and funny, and that only adds to the really poignant moments. Add to that rich description and a fabulous sense of location - New York comes to glittering paranormal life in this book - and some great characters, and there's no way to go wrong with this one. The best of all best friends, Simon, is my favourite, but I'm certain that redheaded-but-refreshingly-not-feisty Clary and irritating but irresistible Jace will have their own fans.<br /><br />I hope boys aren't turned off by the Manly Chest on the cover, since I think this fast-paced tale would appeal enormously to teens of both sexes. And any other fan of the genre - or dabbler in the genre. Come on in, the water's lovely - and there are mermaids.
B0000025OP|4.0|There are some fine songs here and many other reviewers have covered the most popular of them. However, very little has been said about what I consider the best song on the album and that's \\"Dirge\\" - With just a minimalist piano dirge for backing, Dylan sings this incredibly bitter song about the urge we all feel to love and the damage it does to us when it all goes wrong.  <br />  <br />Is there anyone who cannot identify with that powerful opening line: <br />\\"I hate myself for lovin' you and the weakness that it showed\\" ? <br /> <br />Over the next few verses Dylan develops the theme of our love/hate relationship with love itself allowing the bitterness to spill over in lines like \\"I can't remember a useful thing you ever did for me\\" but then leaves himself open to love again in the last line.  <br /> <br />Been there done that... thanks for expressing it Bob. <br /> <br />Then there is the added fun of trying to figure out who he is addressing. The images are of another performer... Is this Bob at the tail end of his marriage reflecting on where he stood with Joan Baez?  Or is that reading the song too literally?  The fact that it is open ended enough to allow people to interpret it their own way is another plus for the song.  A mere \\"Dirge\\" it certainly isn't. <br />

0375414932|2.0|Let me state up front that as a working professional writer, I generally do not like books about struggling writers, and that bias may have colored my attitude toward this book.  <br /> <br />Although I have enjoyed other of William Boyd's novels, this one disappointed. It had all the frustrating qualities of reading a diary without the redeeming quality of being real (i.e. nonfiction). There was little development of the secondary characters that wandered through these pages.  People appear, are involved briefly with Logan Mountstuart, and then disappear, sometimes to pop up with a brief mention every fifty pages or so, other times to be gone and forgotten. Conflicts are introduced, such as Mountstuart's concerns about Maurius Leeping or his involvement with \\"Monday Smith,\\" and then they disappear with the most perfunctory, conflict-free resolution. Too often these \\"journals\\" distance the reader rather than allowing one to empathasize with Mountstuart. One never really understands, for example, what made Mountstuart so immediately and deeply attached to the woman who became his second wife, aside from the cliche that as soon as he saw her, he knew she was special.  <br /> <br />It is hard to care about the people flowing through these pages and even about Mountstuart. The time span covered by the journals is so great that many years are perfunctory summed up in a page or two in hurry-up tell, not show, fashion. I know that this is an authentic recreation of the way real diaries read, but for me it didn't make compelling fiction. I found the many, many meetings with significant historical figures, the explanatory footnotes, and especially the index at the back of the book, just a little too precious. I understand (I think) what Boyd was attempting. The book does read like a person's journal, but for me the format became tedious and frustrating, always leaving me wanting to know more about individual incidents, but caring little about the grand sweep of Mountstuart'slife. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JPCF|5.0|This movie caught me totally off guard.  I expected your typical kiddie cartoon movie, with no real plot.  About half way through I knew this was something special.  This movie teaches a good lesson about not casting people out because they are different, and that our vices cause pain and suffering to others.  The movie talks about humans (aliens) taking the fish, causing the penguins to starve.  Between this movie and An Inconvenient Truth, I think we have a pretty good grasp on what we are doing wrong and how to change it.  Kids cause use this as a learning material, adults can use this as a guide.  Best movie of the year so far!
B000063Y8F|4.0|Unfortunately, I must have received a dud. I agree that it's VERY easy to clean. But, as far as easy to press, mine just isn't. Sometimes I have to put one handle on the counter and push the other handle with both hands. Now, I have small hands and that may have something to do with it. I guess I need a really sharp garlic press if anyone knows of one. Other than that, it's a very high quality product. Maybe I'll wrap it up and give it as a gift to someone with larger hands.
B000M341QE|5.0|Scorsese finally won an award!!!!  Excellent cast with DiCaprio, Damon, Nicholson, Sheen, and Wahlberg...Although, people failed to realize that it was originally, I believe, a Chinese script.  Nonetheless, very good movie that has an excellent twist at the end.  Not your average 90 minute long movie. This movie is 151 minutes long and it was perfect. <br /> <br />Scorsese takes the audience from the beginning to the end of how crime and criminals don't go hand in hand and earning trust is a very big gamble.  A cop (DiCaprio) is working for the mob and a mob (Damon) is working for cops. Both are under covers trying to reveal the \\"rat\\" before the other person does.     <br /> <br />The movie was set in Boston and coming from the East Coast, Scorsese was right on the money.  The accents, attitudes, and back grounds were perfect. Not recommended for children.  Lots of dialogue and a few gruesome scenes, but what do you expect from a gangster movie. <br />

B00008DDSC|5.0|Secretary doesn't seem like the type of movie that would warrant much attention. At a closer inspection we find out that it has the potential for greatness written all over it. Maggie Gyllenhal does a tremendous job as the lead in this film, she definitely left me wanting to see more of her.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Excellent writing, expertly rendered. The reproduction of the period settings is comparable in quality to \\"Poirot.\\" American fans of \\"House, M.D.\\" might be surprised by Hugh Laurie's performances in \\"Jeeves & Wooster.\\" Great comedic entertainment without the sexual vulgarity of contemporary television. The musical content is a definite plus. You can watch this with your kids and everyone will enjoy it.
0618680004|2.0|Richard Dawkins is a tad embarrassing in that he cannot keep his focus on the facts and let the reader form an opinion -- instead, he spends a considerable time dwaddling through pages, hiding behind the bushes of comments made by more scholarly researchers & their quotes, and sporadically lurches from those bushes to take swipes at religion and religious people.  And I am not one of them.  Atheists do not desire to convert people, and Atheism is exactly that - without a faith - void.  An Atheist does not have a need to deconstruct, only a need to personally know the facts that can set themselves free from a presuscribed human manuscript.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|Its true, whether or not you will love this album, I think, has to do with which part of System you like more.  If you are like me and tend to like the faster, funnier, thrashier side of System's style of rock more than their alternative, mellencollie, more serious side, then buy Mezmerize instead of Hypnotize.  I don't think this album was a failure compared to Mez, but I thought it wasn't as good.  Hypnotize certainly wasn't nearly as fun or kickass.  This album did have some decent headbanging tracks on it, but they are not as well written or as energetic as the Mez headbanging tracks.  What this album did best is put out more of the good, soulful alternative rock based tracks System puts in everyone of their albums.  Hypnotize is by far the best track, comparably as good as Aerials and Spiders.  Lonely Day was pretty good too.  But everything else was either half way decent(kill rock n roll) or bland and very similar to other mediocre System songs (tentative, attack, ect).  What I love about both of these albums is how System hasn't lost their talent for catchy, memorable songs.  They both have some not-so-great songs (Vicinity, Old School Hol.), and Darron's singing can get really annoying occasionally, like in Kill Rock.  The lyrics were a bit more thoughtful than Mez though.  They are more comparable to Toxicity. But overall this ain't a bad album, just not their best.
B000JLTRKE|3.0|Stoney always tries to do movies about his generation.  Well he has a hard time accepting the fact that now his generation is retiring and living the good life.  Instead of moving to florida and buying comfy shoes, he decided to take on the latest american tragedy and make a movie about it.  I turned if off after I noticed several innacuracies, with the most glaring one of him portraying a black man as a white man.  Sure, ok, I know they could not find the humble marine who helped out that day, so what does stoney do???? Stoney casts some guy who is not even the same race as that guy.  I feel sorry for the real guy because he was cast wrong.  Just a glaring error that should have been fixed.  And although the jumpers were done well, it did not show how terrible it really was because people on the ground got hit by these jumpers.  Also want to say that hey, the men responsible should have been shown more as cowardly wooses.  Oh wait that will be in another movie, but by then we will get a PC movement like sum of all fears where they change them into modern day na-zis.  Ridiculous times call for ridiculous movies I guess.  Long live fireman and cops.  Does stoney have a son because is so maybe he can show who the real infidels are in a future movie!!!!
0689878451|5.0|Both of my children (ages 2 and 3) are adopted and they caught on to the message that the mommy penguin couldn't care for the baby, so the two daddies took care of the baby and loved him very much.  I think it is a wonderful message to send to my children along with the fact that it is a simple message of tolerance and acceptance of other kinds of families.
B000BEZQ18|4.0|well amazon is being politically correct and im finding all kinds of bugs in the software today.  i wonder if I put my movie review here if it will present itself in all the glory I envision.  I do not need to tell you this because you know that this film is about two boys rolling in the hay.  it had political motivation and you know it.  the sad thing is the story is not very good because unless you swing that way, you are not even going to understand any of it.  even then most of the people i see who do this type of thing thought it was poorly done.  this soundtrack is so so sarejevo so really it is not as good as the soundtrack for titanic, but almost as bad.  I wish Saline Deion was on this one.

B000MXPE7O|2.0|The good shepherd has all of the spooky appeal a film could offer.  Actors who are very well known and recognized as some of the best in the business are seen in it.  So why does this movie stink so badly?  Well what they are really trying to capitalize on is simply everyone's fascination with skull and bones.  Everyone thinks oh yeah it is a secret club with influence so it is bad, well you know most people don't know anything about it in the first place, they just see some film depict a secret meeting and turn into hordes of walking zombies, ranting and raving \\"Bush and Kerry were in it!\\" I just laugh.  The way they spied and used recon and photographs to figure stuff out is kind of neat you know, because that is how they did it back then.  The lady getting thrown out of the airplane on her way to being married was by far the most sickening and sad scene in the film.  Other than that it just plods along like a legless zombie, crawling...reaching...for something it cannot capture.  Do your research because I did and most of the supposed \\"facts\\" of this film in regards to the beginning of the CIA are not even true, which just further shows how Hollywood will bastardize anything of the truth in order to sway the masses and make some money.  They easily accomplish the former, but the latter category they may have fallen short.  Then yeah spice it up with more skull bones meetings which are really so boring and full of false pomp that it is a wonder anyone has figured out these are less deadly than the gangs of thugs that are currently residing in places like Detroit and Orange County.  DeNiro is a great actor but he really cannot save this film.  Damon is superior in this role but Brangelina is clearly distracted by something and is not very focused.  Then again was she ever a great actress or is it just her attractive figure that gets her into this movie?  This film is like some complex dream that Oliver Stone had but forgot half of it so he let some stoner write therest of the script don't you think?  Now here is a thought if you had snakes on that plane then they would not have had time to throw that woman out of there would they?  I think I will tag this movie with Brangelina and Snakes on a plane.
1582701709|2.0|\\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne is nothing more than a rehash of previously written books and articles on \\"You are what you think\\", \\"The Law of Attraction\\", and \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\". And while it's a pretty little book, it's not that well written. The focus seems to be way too much on attaining wealth. The way everyone was talking about it I expected some new methodology to achieve the state necessary to bring positive things into your life. That still remains a secret.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|I was stuck with a bad copy and nothing has been done about it as of yet.
0743289412|5.0|Stephen King has done it again and given me these feelings of inspiration and overwhelming feelings. Lisey's Story is not like anything you have read by him. In my eye it is an accumilation, a portfolio per say of King's work. Forget the suspense and horror you are use to when reading his work. Lisey's Story is of two simple things, very universal in the human language. They are love and sacrafice.<br />This love and sacrifice are between a man and women, so in tune with each other and that they are just not one, they are two- as in two sides of the rainbow or two sides of a coin.<br />The story has the same underlying mystical and psychological tones that is found in most of King's novels, but it is done in such a subtle and beautiful way that when you finish reading this fine story, you have sense that everything is alright in the world. That love can overcome most things.<br />The plot is simple. Lisa \\"Lisey\\" Landon is finally cleaning house after the death of her husband, Scott. He has been dead for 2 years from a mysterious sickness in his lungs. Lisey and Scott were married for 25 years. Scott was a world famous sci-fi/horror novelist and they resided in Maine (Yes, see the possible Mary Sue's going on? A Mary Sue is when the author puts his or hers likeness in their books as a character).<br />The book is from Lisey's point of view. From Lisey's memories and things she and Scott have acquired during the years, we see what type of person Scott was and how they lived their life together. We, the reader go on a journey from when they first met to when Scott was shot by a crazed fan and almost died. We also see the abuse and heartache Scott and his older brother went thorough by the hands of his father. And finally the other world Scott escapes to, to recover from the emotional and mental abuse he endures all through his life, up to his death. Lisey encompanies him on this journey and even enters his world from time to time.<br />Scott is so troubled that only 2 things keep him grounded- his writing and his wife, Lisey. But with any marriage there are problems. Scott abuses alcohol and goes into his fantasy world and almost leaves Lisey by herself because he feels he can't go on. It takes Lisey to save him time and again. In the end her journey about his death and life is a gift from Scott, to show her how special she was to him and about herself.<br />Some people on their blogs and in message boards have grumbled that the language and words Lisey's uses and King has made up between the characters are confusing and take away from the story. At first I was confused, but it because so important and will make sense all in due time. By page 120 my eyes were glued and didn't want to move away. By page 500 I was almost heartbroken because I knew this story would soon end and I woudl be empty, perhaps to go on and read more riduculous fluff.<br />I personally give Stephen King a big THANK YOU! As I write this I think of bools and smucks and even the long boy with the piebald side in the world known as Boo'ya Moon.<br /><br />Katiebabsunded- his writing and his wife, Lisey.

B00000637V|5.0|Berlin is everything you've heard: unbelievably sick, dark, offensive, ugly, violent, guaranteed to clear a room--a truly reprehensible piece of work. As such, it's the only thing in his solo career that comes close to the level of Velvet Underground and Nico or White Light/White Heat. Basically, if you understand what Lou means when he sings \\"how do you think it feels, and when do you think it stops?\\" get a copy. Otherwise, pass by and pick up something lighter (which, to be honest, would be just about anything...).

But the book is disappointing.  As pointed out by C. Daley and J. Williams, the anecdotal material is extremely repetitive and not at all helpful.  Notwithstanding its general reader focus, the ideas for how to move beyond a fixed mindset were limited. The Stanford Magazine article, which is excellent, is available online.

B0000009SF|5.0|I see this work as a continuation of \\"Waka/Jawaka,\\" very similar, but it seems to be more crafted, a more solid body of work. One peculiar thing about the label on this record, it is accredited to \\"The Mothers;\\" yet another assembly of musicians almost completely unrelated to the previous \\"Mothers\\" lineups. But this time around, it is a line-up of twenty-odd something players, a huge band to lead, in a studio or on a stage.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, it is a vehicle for the featured musicians to show off a little in the framework outlined for them, yet it has the trademark Zappa approach, which the true fan, as well as even the casual fan, will notice right away. A very busy, layered sound, full production, and just odd-ball enough to throw you a curve.<br /><br />This is a very beautiful performance. The title track, \\"Grand Wazoo (not to be confused with the other 'Grand Wazoo' from \\"The Lost Episodes,\\" a monologue delivered by Don Vleit with synclavier accompaniment)\\" is a swinging blues/jazz fusion piece with electronically treated electric guitar and dark, brooding horn arrangements, very ominous, but still nice. \\"For Calvin\\" is another taste of the bizarre, it has a dream-like quality, rambling sound, but still organized. \\"Cletus Awreetus-Alrightus\\" is just playful, tack piano, with its \\"La-La-La\\" lyrics and horn solos by Ernie Watts, from Johnny Carson's Tonight Show Orchestra. Somewhat silly, but very entertaining, nonetheless.<br /><br />\\"Eat That Question,\\" what can I say? This is a vehicle for George Duke to treat you to a taste of his piano playing, and the horn section's repetition of the melody line throughout provides a solid backdrop; and I have always thought a high-school marching band could win a competition with this arrangement. And \\"Blessed Relief\\" is a soft, big-band piece, soothing melody, kind of mournful, but as with the rest of this material, a wonderful arrangement, pulled off immaculately by this huge ensemble.<br /><br />On the whole, this release, teamed up with \\"Waka/Jawaka,\\" can provide many entertaining, educational hours of listening and learning pleasure.n the whole, this release, teamed up with \\"Waka/Jawaka,\\" can provide many entertaining, educational hours of listening and learning pleasure.

Nothing followed the book other than boy finds dragon and there is a war -- that's it. Waste of time
B000MQC9H4|3.0|I must say up front that I am a man who enjoys romantic comedies. I can usually find something to bring home on Friday night to watch with the wife that we will both enjoy. So I thought that a film including Kate Winslet, Jack Black, Cameron Diaz, and Jude Law would be a great way to pass an evening on the couch. <br /> <br />I was half right with this film, the half that deals with Kate, Jack, and Eli Wallach. This story ended up with more on the cutting room floor than the \\"complicated\\" Diaz-Law story line which is sad because it is the funniest and most endearing part. Daiz, Law, and the two cute girls playing his daughters are adequate, but my wife and I found ourselves longing to go back to LA to see the fabulous chemistry between Winslet, Wallach, and Black. The stories converge at the end in a very natural way that leaves you feeling OK. <br /> <br />I would say it is worth borrowing from a friend or spending a couple bucks on at the store, but I would reserve my cash for something that I want to see more than once. This is worth seeing once, but only once.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Here are a few more inconvenient truths.  Al is not much of a campaigner, but this movie gives an idea of what kind of manager he is.  If the Florida democrats had paid enough attention to the butterfly ballot and other pre-election shenanigans: <br /> <br />1.  President Gore would have paid some attention to al-Qeada prior to 9/11. <br /> <br />2.  If an attack occurred anyway, President Gore would have swiftly dispatched a sufficient presence of US forces to eliminate Bin Laden and his mob, and not get sidetracked trying to show-up his dad in foreign policy. <br /> <br />3.  We would have continued to run surpluses to finance the coming wave of retirements. <br /> <br />4.  We would have some semblance of an actual health care strategy. <br /> <br />5.  We would be driving homemade energy efficient vehicles, well into alternative fuels and less dependent foreign regimes and beneficial corporations for fossil fuels. <br /> <br />6.  We would have a healthier environment accompanied by the growth of new technology industry. <br /> <br />Yeah, Al is kinda stiff, and maybe sort of a geek.  Not very slick and not a self-assured control freak.  Guess we got to look forward and not spend too much time thinking about what should have been.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This was some of the best harmony I've heard in a long time.  Everyone should at least hear some of the songs!!!
B000HBK3MM|4.0|Ms. Rae has a tiny little voice, that is a pleasure to listen to.  Many have compared her to Billie Holiday, and I agree.  Soulful, yes.  Blues, of course.  Oh yes and that ever present R&B.<br /><br />Though the Grammy Awards snubbed her, hers is a voice that is worth listening to, and in the future only promises more delightful releases.  She is and will be a force to be reconded with as she continues to produce more, music with her very unique sound.  Give this young lady a very serious listen, I do not believe you will find disappointment.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|All is well in 007 land, long live Daniel Craig as Bond, James Bond. This was the only Bond I can remember without a super car and laser watch and it was great. The level of energy, the brutal efficiency of the fights, and having Dame Judy Dench reprise her role as \\"M\\" all contributed to a fine new start to the series. I hope that they keep the energy up and the number of gadgets down. <br /> <br />The reason I refrain from giving 5 stars is that it simply does not rise to that level. Nothing specific, it just did not inspire me the way a 5 does, nor will it be part of my watch it every year collection. It was greatly entertaining but that is all. The only thing that I can point to is the ending. The ending is a little rushed or unnecessarily complicated; I am not sure which or maybe both. <br /> <br />In the final evaluation I highly recommend this film.
0307237699|5.0|This selection was for the school library and classrooms of the Internat' Frere Jerry at Mission Pendjua in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It will be used in the schools developed for the former slave tribe, the Batwa's and the former Master tribe, the Ekondas. They are now being schooled together in the mission schools started by an American Missionary doctor, Jerry Galloway MD.  <br /> <br />It is the intent of this donor that the recipents are able to see the destiny of the world in change through the American experience. To receive the \\"audacity of hope\\" for their civilization and become prepared to be part of the rebirth of their country and continent. <br /> <br />The book gives the true experience of a person affected by race, traditions, split loyalties and claimed by both yet neither race.It is without a doubt inspiration, hopeful and a guide as the Africans come in to their own as individuals and as a society of change. <br /> <br />                                 Joyce M.

B00006SKRX|4.0|Other reviewers have aptly summarized the conceptual gist of the album, but I'd like to talk about the music itself. <br /> <br />The most striking thing about the music of this album is that, when stripped of dynamics, timbres, sound effects, and vocals . . . when reduced to mere chords and melodies . . . it is essentially the same song throughout!  Eighty percent of the time, at least.   <br /> <br />Only two songs (\\"Sexual Revolution\\" and \\"Go Fishing\\") are in a key other than A minor -- and those are both in E minor (which is arguably where Waters does his best work.)  Only \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\" and the title track have their own individual chord sequences and melodies, not repeated elsewhere.  They're also the only tunes with accessible 4/4 rock beats.  Every other song is in 3/4 (think \\"waltz\\"), and at the exact same tempo (near as I can tell, anyway.) <br /> <br />The rest of the material (which I don't mean to dismiss) rests on two or three repeating themes. Interestingly, the most common theme is a rhythm-guitar riff you might recognize from John Lennon's \\"Working Class Hero\\" (not the first time Waters borrowed from Lennon; compare \\"The Gunner's Dream\\" to \\"Isolation\\"). Oh, and just to add to the confusion, this was the year soon-to-be-ex-bandmate David Gilmour tried his hand on Lennon's riff with \\"Near The End\\" on his About Face album! <br /> <br />Another recurring theme is heard at the very beginning of the album, a little harmonium lullaby . . . but guess what:  Change the key, the instruments, and the volume, and you've got the monster guitar riff from \\"In The Flesh\\" from The Wall!  In \\"Go Fishing\\", you'll hear it again with saxophones, along with melodies from \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" and \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\". <br /> <br />Is this wrong?  Is this bad?  Not at all, in my estimation, because the arrangements display a magnificent range in adapting these themes to various moods. As others have indicated, the general \\"feel\\" of the album varies greatly, as does the instrumentation -- not to mention the progression of the lyrics.  I just want to warn you that you MAY find yourself thinking, \\"But this is the same song again!\\" <br /> <br />Well, it's a *good* song . . . . <br /> <br />Eric Clapton, David Sanborn, and the female vocalists have already been praised -- and I agree -- but I must mention the one great player who's been overlooked:  Drummer ANDY NEWMARK. One of the best in the business . . . who's worked with more stars than I can list.  He really shines on this album.  You can't make an album that's mostly in the same tempo interesting without a damn good drummer!  Newmark syncopates and adds odd, assymetrical accents while keeping rigid time.  The recording of these drums are perfect, too.  Some delightfully menacing tom-toms on tracks like \\"Arabs With Knives\\" and \\"Sexual Revolution\\".  (Aside from Newmark, Waters has worked with several great drummers since leaving Floyd, and it could be argued that loveable ol' Nick Mason is actually the worst drummer he's ever worked with.) <br /> <br />Finally, I suggest it is here, on this album, where Roger Waters does the best and most-challenging singing of his career. Sure, he may have sounded more *pleasant* on \\"Shine On\\" or \\"Pigs\\", but this is where he challenged himself the most. Of course, you have to like Waters's \\"nasal scream\\" style of singing in the first place.  He pushes it further than ever, into the range where most males would have to resort to falsetto.  At the peak of \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\", he doubles with the female singers to reach and sustain a high C; a very effective and magical technique. Then again, he masters those high notes without female assistance on \\"Go Fishing\\". Although he's written better material, he has never sung quite the same since. <br /> <br />I knock one star off this review because the concept is weaker than most of his work.  Nevertheless, a unique and fascinating piece, held together with superb musicianship, arrangement, and production. <br /> <br />
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I've been listening to most of these songs for almost thirty years, but they virtually sparkle on this incredible CD, sounding fresh as a new coat of paint.  Sometimes it's just a slight change in phrasing or different instrumentation, sometimes it's the incredible warmth of the sound, making you feel like you're right there in Massey Hall. Whatever it is, the entire album demands to be played repeatedly no matter how many times you've heard Neil Young do these songs before.  It's a beautiful recording and managed to surpass the high expectations I had of it. <br /> <br />The DVD provides visual accompaniment to the entire album.  There's lots of grainy footage of Young performing at the show but also lots of shots of a reel to reel player recording the music.  Intercut with all the performance footage are what look like home videos on his ranch but are probably from the Dutch documentary that is excerpted in the bonus material.  The extras also include a couple of performances recorded for the Johnny Cash show and some video footage from 1997 of Young looking through archival photos of the Massey Hall performance.  You might not watch the DVD many times but it's definitely worth having. <br /> <br />If the rest of the stuff from the archives ends up being this good, it'll be like Christmas all year long.  Check out the link repriserecords.com/neilarchives for a taste of what else is to come.
1579125549|5.0|I own this book and like many that do I have only scratched the surface. I have done the ~300 mates in one, working on the mates in two from the combo section, and have played through about 20 of the miniatures toward the back. I am a tournament player currently rated about 1050 so my review reflects this. I am also a professional educator finishing my Masters degree so I also know good instruction when I see it.<br /><br />So why should you buy this book, and if you are rated below 1600 you probably should. Mr. Polgar had three children and all three reached the top level of chess. Susan Polgar is the highest rated women's chess player in the US. Judit Polgar is the highest rated women's player in the world and a candidate for the World Championship cycle. So we know that Mr. Polgar knows how to create great chess players. The excellent number of varied problems is also fabulous. In what other book can you find hundreds of mates in one, mates in two for both colors, miniatures that focus on specific squares for mating, and endgame problems? The answer is of course: none.<br /><br />This is a book were you find a theme to work on, like mates in two or attacks against the f7 square and work on it for a few months [because there are that many problems] then move onto something else. You pull out this book every night and do 12 - 24 mates in one and try to know them instead of calculate them. You set up a won position on Fritz and try to keep the advantage one afternoon. In other words you live with this book because the material helps keep you tactically sharp on every level.<br /><br />One gripe about the book would be about the solutions. Having one ply [1/2 a move] for an answer is fine for mates in one and adequate for mates in two, but I find myself using software to see complete solutions to some of the problems because I still get stuck [remember I am rated 1050]. This has really not been much of an issue and the book is already so large I can barely imagine what it would look like with lots of variations in the solution section.<br /><br />So buy this book, tag the different sections, work on something interesting or a weakness, and keep your homework fun. You may not need to buy another tactics book for several years.gine what it would look like with lots of variations in the solution section. <br /> <br />So buy this book, tag the different sections, work on something interesting or a weakness, and keep your homework fun.

0201626632|4.0|According to my own experience, this book provides a casual and down-to-earth  (but also extremely accurate!) description of scientific life and the different stages of a scientific career. Maybe it is too physicist-oriented (indeed, solid-state-physicist-oriented), but readers with a different background should also enjoy. (Hope so, I'm also a solid-state scientist!)
B000NA28IE|1.0|I would love to say I enjoyed the movie. But the poor manufacturing of the DVD produced a disc loaded with artifacts. I've literally watched hundreds of DVDs on my player from movies to television shows, and this was the first disc I could not watch. I even exchanged the DVD and the second disc behaved the same way. <br /> <br />Avoid the frustration and read the book.
B00003CXV4|4.0|Knowing how this film ends ruins it, and that seems to be the special joy of too many of the reviewers writing here and elsewhere.  I recommend you just look at the ratings given, then buy this DVD and see for yourself.  Yes, its an oft-times manipulative romance, clumsily executed.  But its heart is in the right place, and it has much to say about modern city life.  In mannerisms, costumes, and decor, the filmmakers reinforce the notion that the intense competitiveness of modern urban life, which worships the 'top dog' above all others, snuffs out any sense of our connectedness to one another, our need to nurture and be nurtured.  That need is perhaps only recognized once again when it is almost literally too late.  It would seem to be too late for Nelson Moss, the hard-driving ad executive, but he hasn't yet met Sara Deever, who somehow knows otherwise.  This movie transcends its genre through the star quality of its two main actors, Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves, and through the last 10 minutes of film.  A city is full of walls, and the highest are spiritual.  She encourages him to drop his guard, but can she drop hers? To nurture and be nurtured you have to drop your guard, revealing that you're really just feeling your way along in life, as if blindfolded.  This metaphor becomes literally true in the last ten minutes of the film, where for some reason the movies big heart transcends its clumsy execution, to become one of the best 10 minutes of celluloid in all of film.

1416914285|5.0|City of Bones had everything you could want.  Interesting characters, lots of action, love, beautiful descriptions and witty lines that make you laugh out loud.  The characters are fresh, exciting and realistic.  They make for the type of people you wish you knew in real life - except for maybe the villains.   <br /> <br />My favorite thing about this book was how much fun it was to read.  I had a good time reading it and am eagerly awaiting the next two books.  If you're looking for an enjoyable story that's hard to put down, then I highly recommend giving this book a try.  You won't be disappointed.  <br />

B0002VB24K|4.0|Well, my favorite has been established. Jason Isaac's character Lucius Malfoy makes me happiest out of all the characters in the books. Sure, he isn't really the same from the books to the movies, but I like the movie look best and the book act the best. ^.^<br /><br />I think Jason overkilled the parental abuse thing, which isn't at all in the books, but oh well. Life goes on. He's used to playing abusive characters. -Smiles.-<br /><br />I love that Draco and Snape have some awesome moments in this movie. GO SLYTHERIN! ^.^ Yay.<br /><br />REALLY good movie. Certainly the best so far. Can't wait for the 5th one. Going to it dressed up as Lucius. Bought the cane, made robes.<br /><br />Well, I can't give it 5 stars with no Lucius in it, so neh... 4 works.
0800177177|2.0|There is so much wrong with this movie that I don't know where to begin, so let's start with the obvious; why is Keanu Reeves in this movie? Who thinks this robot can deliver any credibility in any movie? Winona Ryder is equally horrid and her role is that much more vital. Her gasping doe-eyed schtick is woefully inadequate to convey the power and allure of the woman Vlad pledges unending blood lust in search of. Furthermore, were there no Brits that could play these two roles or were British accents really necessary at all? If so, why in the name of Bumblebee Man did they have to use these wankers who can't keep one going consistently? Gary Oldman - an actor whose work I usually enjoy - is sadly over the top in a role that cries out for subtlety, especially when you consider how much of a cliche this character has become. His garbled accent and the hokey theatrics make me want to giggle more than stay engaged. In fact, my sixteen year old daughter and I cracked up so many times throughout this that you'd have thought we were watching a comedy...and that's not a compliment. There is just so much to laugh at and mock...<br /><br />On the plus side, I thought Coppola's back story of the romance and all was interesting, but in the end, who cares? It is nearly impossible to immerse yourself in the story because Reeves, Ryder, Oldham, and Hopkins are so wretched that you end up wishing it was a comedy - it works better on that level. If you want a good untraditional vampire movie, go rent The Hunger instead.

B000002UC5|3.0|I wish McCartney had spent the time to actually finish some of these tracks, or jettison them for real songs; too many of them are little more than musical doodles that go nowhere.  The album does contain the excellent \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", \\"Teddy Boy\\", and \\"Junk\\", but these and the handful of other songs that bear repeat listening would only 1/4 of a CD (or 1/2 of an LP, for those of you who bought it on vinyl the first time 30+ years ago).

B000NIVJHM|5.0|Usually this comment is reserved for a...well, a girl, but I'm a guy with a sensitive side that emulated Patrick Swayze from the moment I saw this back in '87. Anyway on May 8th, Lions Gate is finally making amends for all the so-called \\"Ultimate\\" and \\"Special\\" and \\"Collector's\\" editions of this film that have been released on DVD since the format was first created back in '96. None of them have the features that we've wanted. Now, it's too early to say exactly what is going to be on the disc(s), but I read on the website The Digital Bits [...] under their Archived My Two Cents, that the new edition will have all-new features including new interviews with Patrick Swayze and...the best thing on this new edition that none of the other editions had...Deleted/Extended Scenes. Did anybody even know that there were scenes left on the cutting room floor? I sure didn't! I'm extremely excited to see what was omitted. I can only hope that Patrick Swayze & Jennifer Grey get together to record a commentary for the film...then it truly will be a Collector's Edition/Special Edition/Ultimate Edition. We'll have to wait and see, but so far I think there's good reason to be excited if you're a Dirty Dancing/Patrick Swayze/Jennifer Grey fan.
B000J103PC|3.0|I watched The Devil Wears Prada on a flight from London to Newark last week. I had decided to watch it because I had heard Meryl Streep gave a very good performance in it (hey, it got her nominated for an Oscar after all) and both my mom and my sister really liked it. Yes, I know what you're thinking right now--what I was doing, trusting my mom and sister on a movie about fashion? Well, truthfully, I didn't know what myself I was doing. <br /> <br />It's a good movie. It's anything but great. The acting is a huge highpoint, though, I can't think of one actor or actress in the movie who didn't do a terrific job. I remember seeing Anne Hathaway in her premiere film role, The Princess Diaries, a million and one years ago. I hadn't seen her act on screen since so that was kind of fun. Meryl Streep definitely deserved her Oscar nomination, and Stanley Tucci never fails to amaze me. <br /> <br />Well, I don't know, maybe it's just because I'm a guy, I'm not into fashion at all, and I believe one should just wear whatever the hell they want and not care what they look like. Seriously. But anyway, it's a fun movie and it teaches a good lesson, that there's more to a person than the outside. Good, not great.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Pride & Prejudice style, this series shares the relationship between a young woman from a southern middle class family, who lived in an ideal setting, surrounded by the comforts and beauty of her hometown. Circumstances make the family move up north, where she meets a cotton mill owner who was formerly rather poor. The perennial struggle between the haves and have-nots brings this couple into an interesting ideological battle that results in great love.  There is intrigue, passion, pain, but in the end... love conquers all. Again...  BBC provides another EPIC mini-series, which we sincerely hope you acquire, especially if you have teenagers at home. We watch... discuss life... and gain by the individual growth that takes place as a result of internalizing the lessons learned / shared by... North & South! Awesome!
1582701709|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. More for what the spiritual side can bring not so much the material objects. Positive thinking is always best, sometimes difficult in this day and age but possible and so worth it. I really believe in the books message and have bought it for several friends and family members.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|While purists may balk at the idea of remixing any of the Fab Four's music, I have to disagree.  The Martins did an incredible job of blending so much of the Beatles' best stuff as only they could.  There are wonderful rarely-heard versions of well known songs (While My Guitar...) and highly effective use of modern digital technology that allows GM and son to transpose songs so as to make them fit together as if they had originally been made to do so (Blackbird/Yesterday).  The last 40 seconds of \\"All You Need Is Love\\" are beautiful - hints of Sgt. Pepper, Ticket To Ride's intro, Goodnight - wrapping up with a goodbye from John that to me was unexpectedly tender in this context.  78 minutes of non-stop Beatles beauty.  Buy this CD. <br /> <br />The DVD audio disc is also a wonderful extra.  Lots of clever mixing that makes some of the songs seem new again!  Nothing like being \\"surrounded\\" by the Beatles all these years later!
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|My cousin has been raving non-stop about this film since last summer when it opened. I didn't see it in theaters (though I regretted not after hearing his praise) so I was eager to rent it when it arrived on DVD. It did sooner than expected and I rented it a week after it made it's premiere on the shelves. First off, let me start by saying my cousin isn't going to be very fond of my review. But I will continue. The movie is shown in flashbacks and opens with Eisenheim the Illusionist, a traveling magician, being arrested. We see the movie as it goes through different time periods, from when Eisenheim was a young boy to him grown up as a traveling magician. He is instantly famed for doing tricks absolutely no one can figure out. But, as Eisenheim says so himself, everything is an illusion. One very good thing about this film was the cinematography. The colors used and camera angles were all very, very, very well done especially the mysteriously filmed sex scene. The storyline was interesting enough, and the acting was very good, but what I found about this film was that is was tedious. I had to fight myself to keep awake during a few select scenes (maybe it was because I started it at 10:30 at night but I'm not sure) and that a lot of it was redundant. I can definitely see why others really like this film but it didn't strike me as something that I would watch over and over again. It's a good film, but it's far from great.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Brandon Routh plays an excellent Superman. But, you've got to love having Kevin Spacey in this movie. His performance is excellent. The first time we saw this movie, we went to IMAX to see it. Amazing! Some of the scenes actually make you feel as though you were flying. In Superman Returns we find Superman leaving Earth to find Krypton after astronomers have supposedly found it. When he returns to Earth, Lois Lane is engaged. And, of course, Lex Luthor is creating all sorts of challenges. Kevin Spacey as Luthor, is planning to destroy California but Superman stops him. Luthor realizes that by using the crystals from Krypton he can build a new continent... and he will hold the deed to the Real Estate. Billions might perish, but as always... Superman saves the day! Would sincerely recommend owning this DVD if you want to add a classic story to your collection.
B000NA28IE|4.0|im a big fan of the books so naturally i was excited when i heard they were doing a movie about it. The only things i did not like about the movie was the fact that Arya does not look like an elf and the \\"dwarves\\" looked like short people instead of what they were suposed to be. The varden's home could have been a bit better. If the same people that did the Lords of the Rings movie did this one then it would be one awesome movie. I do hope that when they do the second movie that they add a little more details to the characters as well as their adventures, instead of cutting things a little short. They did do a great job with Saphira. Overall i thought the movie was pretty good considering it was taken from a book.  I would have given this movie 5 stars if they closely followed the books.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|I discovered Loreena McKennitt's music in the early 1990s and have collected all her CDs since then.  I saw her once live in Seattle which I enjoyed very much. Every new CD she released seemed fresh and I was immediately caught up in her \\"magic.\\"  It has been awhile since she had something new so when I bought this one I expected the same feeling as with others.  When I put it on and starting listening my reaction was sort of an \\"oh\\" that something was missing, that it sounded like a rehash of earlier material, and made me wonder if the Celtic journey had gone on one CD too long.  Having said this, I think it is difficult for any artist to sustain the same quality over time and certainly someone who is new to Loreena and her music would probably not feel the same way as someone who has been following her career over time. That is the challenge of being a long time fan of any artist.  So because I do enjoy and respect her work, I made a point to listen again and I have to admit while clearly it is not really a fresh body of work, it is growing on me and I am feeling some magic again.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|My sister brought the DVD of Love Actually home for Christmas, claiming she had seen it somewhere and that it was fantastic. I checked it out and it seemed just...well, you know...like the average romantic comedy chick flick hooey-looey horse crap that Hollywood has piled on us for the last eighteen millenniums. Shrugging it off, I didn't pay much attention. Well, this New Year's Eve 2006 on the eve of 2007, we had lots of people over and we all sat down and watched it. Now before I continue, anybody who knows me well enough knows that I am an absolute complete SUCKER for romantic comedies. It's just that, well, I haven't found a good one in a long time! Well, let's just leave it at the fact that I found it, and I hit the jackpot to be honest. Mix the movie \\"Crash\\" with \\"The Breakup\\" with \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" with \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" with \\"The Terminal\\" with \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" with \\"The Family Stone\\" and you get LOVE ACTUALLY, the ultimate romantic comedy as the DVD cover boasts. A multi-plot storyline simply about a group of unique individuals trying to find love in foggy Londontown at Christmas time, Love Actually features a stellar all-star cast that includes many, many well-known actors and actresses. In the movie, you get to experience all kinds of love from a different point of view: love between two hardcore porn stars, a young boy hitting on the most popular girl in school, the British Prime Minister and his secretary, an English author and his Portuguese maid, and a million and one other unlikely combos. The result is clear: a funny, feel-good, heartwarming, and above all romantic movie that all can enjoy...not just the romantic comedy suckers like me.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae's debut CD has captivated and charmed millions, and why not? You have a beautiful, winsome young lady who has singing, songwriting, and instrumental talent. She demonstrates a charm and a poise well beyond her youth, and her sound is like a weird combination of Sade, Jewel, and India.arie.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Like A Star,\\" \\"Put Your Records On,\\" and \\"Trouble Sleeping\\" pull the listener in and doesn't let go. With this much talent, a successful, fulfilling future seems to be on the horizon for Ms. Rae, and many of us will be along for the ride.
B000NA28IE|4.0|There is no way a screenwriter could write a move scrip that would equal the book(s).  I thought the story followed the books as best it could and the Saphria is wonderful.  I have read the books twice and listen to the unabridged audio books.  I liked this move.  I hope they continue the trilogy.
B000OLV97I|1.0|I purchased the UNBOX version, or \\"The International Release\\" of Eragon.  The movies' picture disappeared after 42.10 minutes, but not the sound.  Amazon should give me a refund of this defective download. IF they don't, it will be the LAST DL I purchase.<br /><br />As for the story.  One word:  LAME.  I've read Anne Bishop, Eddings, David Drake, all the Pern novels, and more books in Sci Fi/Futuristic than I can remember.<br /><br />Eragon reminded me of Star Wars for kindergarten.  Pern-gone-to-Thread-and-back-again.<br /><br />The movie was a bust.  Characterization was minimal, adversarial relationships were simplistic and almost insulting to anyone with an IQ above 18.<br /><br />If you're 8 and your parents don't mind your brain being sucked out of your skull from inanity...buy the book.
B000M4RG42|2.0|At first glimpse, director Clint Eastwood's \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" is nothing more than just another World War II movie. And we've seen a lot of those in life, haven't we? At second glimpse, Flags of our Fathers is an explosive war epic that will keep you on the edge of your seat. At third glimpse, Flags of our Fathers is, again, nothing more than just another World War II movie. <br /> <br />Let me elaborate a bit: I bought this movie when it came out, expecting the usual fantastic Clint Eastwood direction that I saw in Million Dollar Baby. And since Steven Spielberg was one of the producers, who did Saving Private Ryan, I really, genuinely thought I was going to love \\"Flags of our Fathers.\\" The movie starts out on its feet, running with a bang--the first 30-45 minutes of the movie are very, very interesting, involves much character development, and even packs some good humor into it. The war scenes on the beach of Iwo Jima are very, very intense with lots of good camera-work and throughout the movie there is plenty of disturbing war gore with people's insides covering their bodies, like in Saving Private Ryan. So far, so good, right? Wrong. As the movie progresses, it gets incredibly confusing, you'll find yourself rewinding parts frequently because you thought you missed something, and above all, painfully boring. I tried to keep up with the flashbacks, which I LOVE in films, but they seemed randomly placed and I couldn't believe Clint Eastwood was directing this mess. The ending is awkward and afterwards I pondered the film and thought, \\"My, that was EASILY one of Eastwood's worst films ever.\\" If I were you, I'd save my money on Flags of our Fathers. If I get the chance, I probably will see Letters from Iwo Jima, the Japanese counterpart to this film, since it was supposed to be incredibly better, and I love Asian cinema. <br /> <br />One thing I commend this movie about is the acting, which is phenomenal.

B000002J1U|5.0|THE BAND: Robert Plant (lead vocals, harmonica), Jimmy Page (all guitars, banjo), John Paul Jones (bass, organ, synth, mandolin), John Bonham (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1970) 10 tracks clocking in at approximately 43 minutes. Included with the disc is a minimal 2-page foldout containing song titles/credits/times and original album artwork (though only on rare Japanese & British versions can be found the actual rotatable cardboard piece for the CD with moving images as featured on the original vinyl album). Recorded between Headley Grange (Hampshire) and Olympic Studios (London). Certified 6+ million units sold. Label - Atlantic Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Led Zeppelin \\"3\\" is so different when compared to any of the band's other albums. \\"3\\" is the band's unplugged acoustic showpiece. You'll find some rock and blues, but mostly folk rock here. \\"3\\" opens with the band's most recognized song from the album, \\"Immigrant Song\\", with lyrics inspired by Norway's invasion of England (and I still can't help but remember Jack Black singing the opening to this song in \\"School Of Rock\\"). \\"Immigrant Song\\" reached #16 on the Billboard pop chart. Other highlights include \\"Celebration Day\\" (with it's weird guitar melody), the soft intro to \\"Gallows Pole\\" leading to a climactic end, the mellow \\"Tangerine\\", Bonham's collaboration \\"Out On The Tiles\\", \\"That's The Way\\", and one of my all-time favorite blues tracks from Led Zep, \\"Since I've been Loving You\\" - and the story it tells (a desperate man... working long hours... life is a drag... losing his mind... since he's been loving her). And speaking of different - check out the hand-clapping square-dance shuffle otherwise known as \\"Bron-Y-aur Stomp\\". Where Led Zeppelin's debut and 2nd album were true hard rock albums, this 3rd album changed the listener's perception of the band. Most notably, on five of the ten tracks, the featured instrument is/was the acoustic guitar. \\"3\\" does contain one of my least favorite songs in their entire catalog, the distorted \\"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper\\". Overall, \\"3\\" is on a different level than the rest of Led Zeppelin's releases. Considerably more mellow and acoustic, but still a classic (5 stars).s in their entire catalog, the distorted \\"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper\\".

B000LXH0AE|5.0|Nobody likes Harold Crick. <br /> <br />Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is an IRS agent who is a genius at math. If someone shoots two numbers at them, he will multiply them instantly with the correct answer. He has a wristwatch that he depends on everything for. He wakes up, gets on the bus to go to work, and falls asleep all at precise times down to the second that if he misses, his day will be forever messed up. His schedule repeats every single day of his life. Oh yeah, and Harold hears voices too. It's almost as like someone is narrating his dull life...not telling him what will happen, but what already happened. This voice comes and goes at seemingly random times. One day Harold is re-setting his wristwatch after it randomly shut off while waiting for the bus when the voice says \\"Little did he know, this simply seeming innocent act would result in his imminent death.\\" When Harold hears this, he begins to fear his death obsessively. But he is not sure what to do. <br /> <br />It turns out the voice is real. It is the voice of author Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) who has a bad case of writer's block and a heavy addiction to smoking. She is writing a new novel about an IRS agent named Harold Crick who is very good with numbers. Little did SHE know, Harold Crick was a real person, and just by writing the book, she was controlling his life. Oh yeah, and she wanted to kill off Harold in the book at the end. Fortunately, her writer's block makes the voices Harold hear go away temporarily, and he lives his life in his control. This drives her to hire the expert writer's assistant Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) who vows to help her finish the book and kill Harold Crick. <br /> <br />Harold sees a psychiatrist who recommends him to the acclaimed English literature expert Jules Hibbert (Dustin Hoffman). Together, they try to find out if this voice--who they don't know is a real author writing a real book about Harold--is trying to write a comedy, or a tragedy. So Harold begins tokeep track of issues in his life to find out. In the meantime, Harold falls helplessly in love with a young woman who works at a bakery (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who he just happens to be auditing. As you can probably guess, issues revolving around that ended up around the \\"tragedy\\" column. <br /> <br />Stranger Than Fiction is by far one of the best films of 2006, and I think Will Ferrell's best film yet. The acting is phenomenal: Will Ferrell is in his best role EVER. Emma Thompson is spectacular and soars above many of her other roles in her incredibly realistic portrayal of an author with writer's block. Maggie Gyllenhaal and legend Dustin Hoffman do a fantastic job as well. <br /> <br />Stranger Than Fiction has one of the most unique stories I've ever seen, if not THE most unique. I was SHOCKED after watching this to know this was completely ignored by the Academy, including a Best Original Screenplay award that would've totally locked sabers with Little Miss Sunshine. Hell, this is one of the most original screenplays I've ever had the pleasure of watching. You won't believe your eyes and ears that someone can actually write a movie like this. I'd say underrated with a capital U. <br /> <br />There's not much more I can say except RENT THIS MOVIE NOW. A film like this simply cannot be missed out on. You will not be disappointed.
0743454537|2.0|As a parent of a child who had cancer, I was intrigued and initially I, like so many readers, found the book engaging and a page-turner.  I became increasingly uncomfortable with the book the more I read.  The book perpetuates myths about childhood cancer that may be very harmful to children who develop cancer and to their parents in making decisions.  One myth would be that childhood cancer is an unremitting, decades-long disease process with no cure in sight, as it appears to have been for the child with cancer depicted in this book.  In reality, genuine success has been achieved in the treatment of childhood cancers in the past 25 years and 80 to 90 percent of childhood cancers are curable in a short period of time, including the type described in the book.  I won't say the year of going to chemo clinic every few weeks and waiting for test results was fun, but we became closer as a family and we saw our child get well and grow into a normal adult today. The doctors and nurses were among the smartest and kindest people I have ever met. Childhood cancer diagnosis is difficult enough to hear.  Families don't need to be frightened by the unlikely scenario presented in this book.  They need support and direction to one of the many regional childhood cancer centers (MD Anderson, Boston Children's, Johns Hopkins, St. Jude's etc.).  Certainly, the last thing parents of these children need is a trusted friend, clergyman or teacher telling them that the treatment experience is likely to be drawn-out, painful, conflict-of-interest ridden and family-destroying, like this story.  I am most concerned that such a person might advise the family that it would be ethically acceptable, even preferable, not to treat their sick child.  To me, that is the REAL ETHICAL ISSUE in childhood cancer - well-intending adults giving faulty advice to families experiencing childhood cancer, based on inaccurate assumptions drawn from personal experience with less treatable adult cancers. I also question the legal assumptions of the book.  \\"Informed consent\\" is legally required for anyone to donate an organ and is difficult to obtain in the case of a minor.  And aren't organs supposed to be distributed according to objective priority lists?  Doesn't a guardian lose power without a person to act for? From a medical standpoint, isn't the ending hard to believe?

Tears ran down my face and I hugged the book to say goodbye.<br /><br />The brilliant time line swirls are truly like a composer putting together a symphony - Zusak weaves time and story into such a deep, rich song that you are never angry, lost or sad when horrible things happen because he has held your hand through the pages letting you know gently about the horror Nazi Germany and WWII have in store for these rich, beautiful characters.<br /><br />It truly should be added to high school book lists everywhere.

B00005JMYI|5.0|<br />How rare it is when we get a comedy like this. I actually did not see Anchorman in the theaters, passing it by, thinking it was just one of those stupid crude, anti-women movies that focus all on sexual humor. Well two years later my friend sat me down in front of the TV on a rainy afternoon and we watched Anchorman on HBO. I was immensely surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It's that type of humor you have to understand to like--humor you find in movies such as Nacho Libre and Dumb and Dumber. You have to sit down and watch it with a complete open mind, because if you're expecting some genius great comedy movie, prepare yourself for a huge disappointment. I wasn't expecting a great comedy movie, and the humor is that stupid humor that makes you laugh harder than a solid, real comedy film. The acting is both great and hilarious with a side-splittingly hysterical role by Steve Carell and smart, classy roles by Ferrell and Applegate. It even features a hell of a lot of celebrity cameos, including Jack Black and Luke Wilson. And the best part about this movie? It gets FUNNIER AND FUNNIER every time you see it, until the point where you helplessly burst out laughing when you see the DVD on a shelf in Blockbuster. And then there's no turning back. You're officially owned by the Channel 4 newsteam now. <br /> <br />5-Stars

We actually listened to it during dinner. It was good straight through. Haven't heard much of \\"Death Cab For Cutie\\" other than this CD, but would definitely check them out more now!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is very well worth the money. Kenny Wayne Shephard has got such great talent, and what a great thought in getting all these blues artist on this cd. What a great vision in putting this cd/dvd together, all of his hard work has been worth it.  I have personally seen Kenny Wayne Shephard 2 times, soon the be 3 if my luck holds. All the songs on this is so wonderfully done, and thankfully you can hear Kenny Wayne play on all the songs. The dvd is just great, and being from Kansas what a pleasant surprise that the dvd starts and ends at the blues studio in Kansas. I very highly recommend purchasing this cd/dvd, I don't think anyone would be disappointed in this, I am so glad I purchased it. I will enjoy playing this for all my friends and without a doubt they will be blown away by the whole cd. Thank you Kenny Wayne Shephard.
B000E6FSPW|4.0|I enjoyed the music from Rocky IV. The Training Montage, War, and No Easy Way Out a great deal. Living In America was FANTASTIC. The other songs on the disc were fine, but those four formed a great loop in my head. When I'm doing something physical I'll mentally replay them and they provide a great pick me up. I'd recommend this to any Rocky fan, and also to anyone looking to find great music for a workout.
B00030590I|5.0|We bought this after seeing \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and \\"House of Flying Daggers.\\"  All three of these movies have beautiful cinematography.  \\"Hero\\" is a long story, told from different view points, and a little hard to follow at times. But visually, it is stunning. Every scene is beautifully designed, and worth watching. Hard to do it justice trying to describe it in words -- you have to see it.
B000AQBAUI|5.0|This album is great, a lost treasure to be sure. I can kinda hear the Led Zep influence some here have cited, I think they sound more like Trapeze during the Medusa era. Early 70's rock, with tasty licks and strong vocals. Great package with extensive liner notes, and history of the band. Recomended
1582701709|3.0|Being possitive is good advise and I agree with much of what was written. <br />ButI think this carries it too far. <br />Thinking about a parking space won't get you one. And if you do find one it is only because no one else parked there YET and not because you thought it.  Now taking action to find one by driving around will find one. So the bottom line is the action you take to get what you want will in many cases get it, not the thought of getting it.
0780624890|5.0|I have bought all of the blade movies. I decided to watch it again the other day and had almost finished the movie when it quit and I had to eject the dvd. I had bought this used but never watched it. I threw it in the trash and ordered a new one. I love the blade movies and Wesley Snipes is great in all of them. I also like kris christofferson. This is a movie that is exciting from beginning to end. Pop you some popcorn, get a coke and sit back and enjoy this movie. This deserves a five star rateing. <br />Bobby Standlee
B0000057C5|1.0|I dont get why everyone loves this band. Their music is boring and repetetive, the lyrics are stupid beyond belief, and worst more, they rip-off Type O Negative to the EXTREME!<br /><br />When I used to live in Russia and they played their, people who listen to pop actually went to the show! So I guess its better calling Rammstein a pop-metal band, considering true German metal is Kreator, Sodom, and Necrophagist.<br /><br />Avoid this garbage, get Kreator's Endless Pain and Necrophagist's Epitaph.
B00006CXXU|2.0|I ususally like Aguilera and I need a song to practice for dance so I bought this one for \\"No Other Man\\" figuring I would like the other songs as well.  I was so wrong. I hate the rest of them.
B00003CWLF|5.0|This is a great movie to have in your library. It is basically a film along the lines of The King and I. Jodie Foster is the perfect match for her role. She grabs you and draws you in, making a personal connection with the characters. Chow Yun-Fat is, also, a very good fit for his role as emperor.  <br />The film makes you take a good look at how personal realtionships within your own family are about the most important thing you have. It also draws attention to the importance of respecting others. I'm not going to use the word 'tolerance'...but for the closed-minded, tyranical types, this film will ease that person into realizing the many good qualities in other people.  <br />Oh, and don't forget the falling-in-love portions of this movie. Crossing boundries for those forbidden pleasures alway make for a good time.  <br />This is a great film for those who like to ride the emotional rollercoaster. You'll laugh, get ticked-off, cry, get the warm-fuzzies...you get the point. <br />So, grab your sweatheart, get a blanket, pop some popcorn, turn the lights down and enjoy this timeless work of art!

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This is one of the worst adaptations of Austen's novels I've ever seen.  The characters (specially Elizabeth) look and behave like XXI century people in costume. All the cleverness of Austen's novel is gone.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia was the predecessor to Crash. It was the first of it's kind and a masterpiece. Tom Cruise's performance is worth the price of admission.
B000K7VHJQ|1.0|I should have left this review a long time ago. I could kick myself for buying it, thinking it was a film, not a religous object. If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals, you risk being burned at the stake, an act of love to purify your soul.  <br />This film,as a film, disregarding the topic, is a dog. A cheap \\"B\\" grade, blood spurting, flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles. I could go on for an hour, but won't bother.
B0006J28L4|5.0|This movie definitely did not get all of the praises that it deserved.  Spike Lee basically brought Malcolm X's life story back to life. Every aspect of his life was in this film.  Furthermore, Denzel put his heart and soul into this role. If you didn't know better you would say that he was Malcolm X for real. I still don't understand why he didn't win an oscar for this role. Everybody else in the movie like Angela Bassett and Al Freeman did their thing too. This is a film that you will enjoy forever.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Not much more to say. This is a great film. Worth owning because you'll be wanting to watch it again. Great plot - great filming. Ed Norton has to be one of the finest actors since Pacino.
B000LC55F2|5.0|This movie is what a drama should be. Im not too much into drama's but this one was pretty tight. A game of jealousy and envy that spirals out of control. I enjoyed it better the second time around because you notice a lot of small but significant details that might not be apparent at first. You will like this film.
B000GT7XXW|4.0|This is a review of the Amazon Unbox Video version. <br /> <br />I saw this Hamlet a few years ago on VHS tape. It was a mesmerizing experience, and watched it straight through with a friend. <br /> <br />The only problem that I have (not 5 stars), is that the Amazon viewer that you must download is missing several navigation features that are sorely missed. Even iTunes will remember where you left off. <br /> <br />I think that they should have a scene selection menu, especially with a video of this length. <br /> <br />You should be aware that you might need to turn off your firewall software, Zone Alarm in my case, to complete the download. When I was only able to download 1/3, and then it wouldn't continue, my e-mail to Amazon was soon answered with a link to initiate a phone call with their help service. The trick was to delete the file and then to prompt it to download again with the firewall disabled. <br /> <br />This $9.99 price includes a format for mobile viewing, but the iPod is not supported, and iTunes doesn't offer this video. <br /> <br />Now, I have the Hamlet Variorum to complete the experience of enjoying and understanding some of the Elizabethan metaphors, eg, \\"chameleon's dish.\\"

As part of her speech at graduation, she again chose to read this touching and classic Seuss.  Many of us cried at this point, realizing that we really hadn't moved so far ahead, but more like come full circle.  I would highly recommend (and hope that someone decides to do so at my reception) that this book be read as part of a wedding reception speech.  It really does apply to marriage in ways.  This story will be read to my children the day they are born, brought home from the hospital, baptized, each birthday, when they begin and graduate pre-school, begin each year of school, graduate from high school, and each and every stepping stone.  They will all have their own copy, and they will learn over time about how that it really does apply to EVERYTHING, from their birth, to school, to employment and also to the births of their own children.  I highly recommend this book to EVERYONE!
1582701709|5.0|Life changing! I was skeptical at first so I tried to attract small things like the book suggested. It worked right away. It has worked for everything I've tried. Last year we tried to sell our house for nine months. Nothing. So we took it off the market. After reading this book we decided to try to sell it again and it sold in one week. Thank you Rhonda Byrne for spilling the beans and not being able to keep \\"The Secret\\".
B0009A40ES|5.0|This movie is excellent and achieves brilliance in all ways. It's funny, it's scary, it's thought provoking. the movie captures the absurd horror that is Patrick Bateman (the main character.)
B000002AEN|5.0|Fabulous singing, guitar playing that must have had a great influence on Jerry Garcias acoustic stuff. And wonderful songs.
B000002O51|5.0|3rd stage, the aptly named 3rd album from this great 70's rock band, is a journey rather than a series of songs. For this reason it is difficult to pick a favorite track. This compilation of material really needs to be listned to at one sitting, preferrably in the dark, to be appreciated. Every now and again you find a record that you love ALL of, and don't get sick of. This is one of those for me. The transitions between tracks and the works of the guitar hooks draws you into the chapter. If I was forced to pick my favs they would be the haunting Hollyann, the powerful Cool the Engines and We're Ready. <br /> <br />Buy this album!
B000M5AJQI|5.0|Although a remake this is a great movie.  The plot is full of twists and keeps you captivated during the whole movie and the casting and directing are superb.  <br />I will not got into details as I do not want to ruin the movie for the ones that have not seen it yet.  I will jusst say that it is a mob and police movie.  I should warn that there is a lot of graphic violence so if someone has underage kids or does not like seeing violence then maybe you should stay away from it.  <br />All in all a great movie that you will enjoy
B000NA28I4|5.0|I have to disagree with the one-star ratings.  I thought this movie was very enjoyable and well done.  The animation of the dragon was flawless, and you could really see the attention to detail the creators had with Saphira.  Just look at her breathe fire or see the water bounce off her as she enters the cave through the waterfall.  Seamless effects and a good storyline that draws you right in.  The psychic connection Saphira had with Eragon was a nice touch, and that if a dragon rider dies, his/her dragon dies too, which makes it even more important for the dragon to protect the rider.  Often movies adapted from books disappoint the readers, and this may be no different, but I did not read Eragon (which is rather long), I just enjoyed the movie.  It is rated PG and is appropriate for older kids and beyond.  I bought it, and have no complaints.  If you like dragons and fantasy, give this movie a chance.
074356619X|5.0|I recieved The Secret and have listened to it 2 times already. I feel that what it has to share can and will be life changing. The principles are easy to understand, and it is shared in such a way that anyone can follow the principles. I would recommend it to everyone.
B00005N6KG|1.0|These headphones are way too flimsy to stay put when running on the treadmill.  They fit fine when I'm  still, but as soon as I start running, one side comes out and rests on my outer ear, while the other side is barely in, not to mention the head band keeps migrating down. I kept having to adjust it while exercising, which was super annoying.  Next time I'll shell out the extra money to get the Sony MDR-A35G S2, still lightweight but stay put in your ears.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Although I have unilaterally dispised every other creation by Spike Lee (who gave that guy a camera?), this high-intensity movie actually through me for a loop - plus, it has Clive Owen and Jodie Foster!
1416914285|5.0|City of Bones is good. Very, very, good. It was better than I  <br />expected it would be, and I expected magic. That said , there are a few things I really loved that I want to mention (nothing too detailed--I don't want to give anything away!) <br /> <br />~I love the character of Simon and his fanboy-ness. I've always wondered about fantasy books and why they always seem to happen to people leading otherwise normal lives who are shocked about the appearance of supernatural or otherwise unusual elements into their lives. I wondered why there weren't any books about kids who liked fantasy when stuff started going down.....and now there is one. Clary herself fits the description pretty well, because of her interest in anime and whatnot, but Simon is the one who takes what he's learned from games and anime and movies, etc. and apply it to his new life, sometimes with good and <br />sometimes with bad results. He is exactly the character I have always wanted to read about. <br /> <br />~I also love Magnus Bane, because he is super cool, and because of the name of his cat. That's all I'm going to say about that. <br /> <br />~The twistyness and turns...The book is very suspenseful, and even though I did suspect a few of the things that turned out to be true, I was never completely right. Every revealed secret, every shocking development was much more complex than I'd guessed, and I love that. <br /> <br />~This book is very quotable. I found myself rereading lines  <br />constantly, because they were funny or great or so true that I was amazed  <br />they'd never been put into words before this. <br /> <br />~ Clary's New York. The world of the Shadowhunters, the demons, and  <br />the sundry other creatures is woven seamlessly into New York. There's a  <br />lot of detail in both, and that makes it seem real and believable...not  <br />that it makes you believe that there are Shadowhunters who live in New York in just this way, but that if there were, this is likely enough how it could happen. It makes you look at things new, all over again. <br />

B000E6ESL2|5.0|I like movies that beg for the contribution of the viewer. I like to be intellectually tantalized during a projection so that I don't feel like a stupid cow in front of a train. With popcorn in my hands. So when, after a few scenes of STAY, I noticed that the main character's name was Sam Foster while the director's name is Marc Forster, I knew then that I was about to watch something different, the icing on the cake being the job of Sam Foster : psychiatrist. Wow.<br /><br />Then comes the inevitable question in the viewer's mind : What is the movie about ? At first, we are prone to believe that the topic of STAY will be to show us how Sam Foster will manage to convince his patient Henry Letham to give up his intention to commit suicide. But soon, other options suggested by the director strike us. Thus, the movie could also be a sci-fi film about a psychic guy able to predict future events. Or is it rather a dream ? Numerous references to the Greek mythology, Freud or the Buddhist mystique seem point to this direction. If not, why does the director insist on showing us so many stairs in STAY ? It is evident then, the word stairs and the second part of the psychiatrist's name Fo-STER creating the kind of association we could find in a dream, that STAY is Henry Letham's dream. Finally, there is a last question the viewer has to answer : why does Henry Letham experience such a dream filled with guilt-feelings ?  See STAY to know the answer.<br /><br />A DVD for your library.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|It is true what everyone has said - this is a compelling and very well told documentary outlining the disaster that is Global warming.  Al Gore definitely knows how to manipulate his audience.  After over a thousand times giving this presentation, it is clear it has been finely honed to deliver a message he is clearly passionate about. <br />Does it stick to the facts and deliver a balanced and scientific message?  Alas, no.   <br />The argument is basically this. <br />Man = vastly increased CO2. <br />Vastly increased CO2 = vastly increased temperature. <br />Vastly increased temperature = earth pushed through a series of storms and disasters to an irreversible tipping point, beyond which we cannot save it. <br />There is no doubting man creates more CO2 and this affects the atmosphere in which we live.  The link between CO2 and temperature rise is then shown.. however, leaps in logic are made.  Does temperature rise perhaps increase CO2 and not the other way round? This is not explored.   <br />Statistics can be very compelling and very misleading.  Most of Gore's statistics are shown very cleverly but also often without scales and origins, blurring the line from science to propaganda. <br />What about beyond the science, and the movie as a movie?  Well, it is not just the powerpoint presentation it is portrayed as.  It also includes breaks in the data to show Gore's own history with the subject.  This is clearly intended as an emotional manipulation as well as a break in `boring' statistics, but has the effect of bringing a political agenda at odds with what is being said, and I feel detracts from the overall argument. <br />In terms of extras, there is a nice update from Al Gore on some additional data that has come out since the movie was made, in particular some interesting data on the effect on corals.  In addition, for those passionate about the movie, there is a `making of' as well as two commentaries on the movie, and a music video of Melissa Etheridge'sOscar winning song. <br />At the end of the day, this is the most compelling case for conservation of resources seen in popular media by a prominent figure.  I hope everyone sees it and it has an impact on their lifes and habits, as it is too important a subject to ignore.  However, I hope that is viewed with a scientific scepticism that makes people want to find out more about the facts.   <br />This movie is in effect a wonderfully effective wake up call - an emotional punch to alert people to the ideas of conservation and the changes happening in our planet.  However, it is not in itself a solution or a definitive answer, it is one sided and errs more on emotion than science.
1582701709|5.0|The information put forth by The Secret is profound, but NOT new. I think that everyone is aware of the Law of Attraction. However, it is the negative society that is shoved down our throats that keep us down. We as a society are responsible for that. Now, The Secret is the hammer that will help people (that choose to) to break down that barrier. As many have said, there are other materials that have discussed this subject. But, not a single one of them has had the impact that The Secret has had. I have heard that this book is dangerous....and I believe it is. It is dangerous because it makes us aware of what we are fully capable of. The people that call this book dangerous are scared. There is quote that defines this very clearly. \\"What scare average people the most? They are scared of people going ABOVE average?\\" Above is an understatement. I believe The Secret will open many doors for many people, again if they choose to.  <br /> <br />A million Thank You's to Rhonda Byrne!!! <br />This is the book that I have been waiting for.

1582701709|4.0|There is nothing new about The Secret. It's been taught by hundreds of people the world over. As the book itself points out, people have known about the power of positive thinking-- the power of our thoughts-- since we've known how to speak them. This book puts the matter in a light that we can sit back and arrogantly call \\"magical thinking\\",\\"-dangerous\\" and \\"superstitious.\\" Or we can give a closer look and learn something. Yes, it's been hyped a lot and brought a lot of surface attention. But perhaps our society is so glutted with media flash that it's the only way a message can reach us any more. Here's an experiment for you:I'll loan you my parking lot angel. Next time you look for a parking place in a crowded lot, ask Murray to find a space for you. Think of how pleased you'll be to find one. FEEL how pleased you are when you find one. Then note how long it takes. By the tenth time, maybe you'll begin to believe, if not in the power of your thinking, then in my parking lot angel! :)Meanwhile, read this book, never mind about Oprah and the glitz, and take note of the message. You create your life by the power of your thoughts. And the key is to FEEL the result of your thoughts. FEEL your gratitude at getting what you want. Then keep the book around for a refresher when your thoughts slip back into their old patterns. It's fun to read, anyhow.

B000000ZGO|5.0|Isaac Hayes' \\"Hot Buttered Soul\\" was radically different from anything which Stax Records had previously released. Hayes' eclectic mix of Soul, Jazz and lush, symphonic orchestration was certainly revolutionary back in 1969...but it made him a superstar. In retrospect, Hayes' 1969-74 recordings laid the foundation for Disco and this album remains a pivotal release. Indispensable.

1592401791|5.0|I became a Beatle fan in the 80s, when I was 12 or 13, so the revolutionary changes they brought to the music world had already long been standard techniques I heard in music daily.  I have always wished to somehow be able to listen to their music with the perspective of those who heard them at the time, when what they were doing sounded so unlike anything they had heard before.  This book has given me that wonderful experience, at least as close to it as is possible.  Reading this book became an interactive experience as I would read passages about the process behind recording a certain song, and then I would listen to the song with a huge grin, hearing new things I'd never noticed before.  Songs I'd always loved suddenly opened up in so many layers that I had never been aware of before. <br /> <br />For example, all the information behind \\"Day in the Life\\" showing how it grew from John's first sampling on his guitar to the complex composition I thought I knew had me listening to it over and over. I heard it in not just a whole new way, but in a deeply layered way, turning it from a song I really liked into a work of art I now am absolutely astounded by. <br /> <br />The simple note of feedback at the beginning of \\"I Feel Fine\\" never meant much to me as I grew up with feedback drenched music all around me.  But learning in this book that it was the first time anyone had ever used feedback intentionally in their music, and how John & Paul accidentally discovered it, made that simple note much more meaningful and significant. <br /> <br />It's also fun to hear the personal aspect, always keeping in mind this is one man's interpretation of what he saw. The relationship amongst the Beatles and how they worked together (especially John and Paul), gives me more insight into the phenomenon I missed.  The writing style is simple and easy to follow, even the very technical aspects.  A great book for fans of the music and the people who changed everything. <br /> <br />
B00005JLK1|1.0|I thought this movie sucked so bad...My fiance made me watch and I fell asleep during it...The best part was at the very beginning when everyone on the ship was killed...Don't waste the money or time...
B000005IU2|5.0|This is what hell sounds like. Forget the dumb reviews talking about bad musicianship, sludge etc. This is a fantastic album that grinds along, and implodes at the end like a rocket in the sky. Buy it buy it buy it.
