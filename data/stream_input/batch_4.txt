B001B5DCO4|5|great
B00DWVN08I|5|Just as expected.
B004W5SGBO|4|easy to assemble and does the jobs, help move the battery around with the handles and with the very deep well on the motorhome I could not have put the 79# battery in without the handles on the this box.
B000VUASMY|5|as promised
B00CXXSP4K|5|very bright... had to upgrade DRL fuse and flasher fuse on 00 chevy 1500 but it was worth it.... bight enough blue to get me pulled 4 times.... i love em
B00W8DBZQU|5|Made by Mopar for Jeep and at a fraction of the cost from the dealership. If you have a Jeep Renegade (first, congrats on that fun little SUV), then you will want to get these if you live in a four season climate. They cover the the entire area of the floor... are relatively deep and should do a good job come winter (but we shall see).
B004ULN610|3|Appears ok, but no PL259-PL259 50 ohm jumper cable came with it so haven't used it yet.
B00DT82INW|5|perfect fit and delivered as promised!
B00BTSF5RK|5|Worked great. And, if you go to Key Smart, I got two keys cut and programmed for only $60. Far cry less than the dealer.
B009WXGD02|1|To small  should  read  more before  purchasing
B00PIL9Y9Y|2|The 3M tape is the shitiest i have ever used . I had to actually use little bit of crazy clue so that it can stay on my car .
B00BEXFK5W|5|So far so good nice shine and seem pretty well made I hope they still look this good after the winter
B00IT4XHOK|5|Perfect fitment, awsome price.. happy to have done buisness with this company...
B0013REXO8|5|Did everything as promised; easy to install. They look great and will offer some protection to the taillights on the trail
B004QEJ6CO|4|Great alternative to heavy clunky chains
B000P72C90|1|The magnet inside was not aligned straight. If I had overlooked it, this could've been a disaster. This is NOT something you want to risk stripping. Pic included. I had just finished putting anti-seize on the threads before I noticed this. Get something of better quality, preferably American made. Gotta catch a ride to the store now to get a real socket. This product added hours to what should've been a quick job.
B009DJJFIW|5|Thanks, great
B00F5GVOX6|5|Love it!
B0041TP0WE|5|easy to install
B0002JMIEK|5|Best wax on the market. Been use it for years.
B0009IQZH0|5|Excellent towels but for the price should probably be thicker. Can't really complain beyond that.
B00CT2Z2DC|5|perfect fit for the 94 accord and a good price.
B000AYHGKS|5|Lincoln just has the best--period
B005LDBDI4|5|Incredibly easy to use.  I painted a very glossy ceramic statue with the primer intended to paint over the primer but it looked so great just with the primer that I left it like that.  I also used it as a primer on an old music box and then used the gold spray paint on it and it came out beautifully.  Very, very happy with purchase.
B008C1Y2I0|1|did not fit vehicle
B002P8T3A8|5|Installed myself and it fit perfectly on my 2007 Pontiac vibe!
B00308LYG8|5|LOVE THESE! 95  Wrangler YJ.
B002UCADVM|5|Perfect fit
B00ORX9VCO|5|Factory part, works great.
B00Y15V6A8|5|good item, fit perfect and received quickly
B009DJKVLW|4|Works well
B00HZY6I0U|1|Awkward. I tried to use it but could not.
B00CG5RYEW|5|thx
B000CLMMYO|5|Work Good
B000GU587Y|5|Cover fit perfectly material sturdy
B008875RAK|5|My Husband loved it.
B008G1X6X8|2|Were made to look, and fit, exactly like the factory lights, but unfortunately the quality isn't the same. After being install for about 2 weeks I was flagged down by another motorist at a traffic light. The piece of the light housing that holds the light I tot he truck bed had broke and the light was just hanging by the wiring harness. Very disappointed.
B00BMGU35I|5|Looks very good on my helmet
B000C9D8OO|5|the 1st one I ordered had a bad clutch and would not engage unless tapped on, replacement under warranty worked fine
B007JF3GKU|5|Works fine and transition was quick and efficient.
B013I7U35S|3|It makes my disaster of a key fob much more pleasant to look at, but now the fob does not fit into the key slot. If that's not a deal breaker for you, then this is a great product.
B000IHIAES|5|Excellent product for the price. A must have tool for any NVH technician. This is the best way to narrow down the source of a noise with definitive diagnosis in a short time. Wireless is better, but for 1/3 to 1/4 the price, this is the best option for most techs.
B00FJ19VKU|1|too larg
B00KO678FK|5|looks great and does what it's supposed to do.
B0081T54ZI|2|Didn't work with my car. Had to return it. Replacement works fine.
B00AZOWSJM|5|This is the second home I've installed one of these in.
B00BH2YW7C|5|Fits perfectly. Installs easily,just take your time.
B000RT9BNQ|5|Very good
B00H9K1ABC|3|This product is 14/6 cable.  The PVC jacket is not quite as thick as I expected but according to the manufacturers temperature ranges for the cable it will suffice.  Price was good for what I received.
B006H34ABY|3|Kind of hard to hold on to despite the grip on the back. I prefer the mitt to this.
B00TUSXGTA|5|Mirror was as specified - fit my 2010 Cooper Clubman perfectly and very easy to install.  Awesome!
B00C3OCSMO|5|Excellent Quality, Very Clean Cut, Excellent Solid Back piece. Light weight. Not allot of foo foo/pockets and such. VERY NICE Heavy Duty #10 Zipper. I would Definitely buy another one.
B001LHVOVK|1|DOES NOT WORK. i bought this and it just does not work. i tried all the steps including those in the review and it does not work. The only reason i have not returned this item is because it is to costly to return .I HAVE A NISSAN AND IT DOES NOT WORK. tried it in others cars...and guess what ..IT DOES NOT WORK.
B00538TU8C|5|Good OEM replacement. I wish they were a little heavier duty than OEM, but as long as I'm careful I won't break it again! Super easy to replace
B00YB45QGY|4|Very pleased.  Finish is very nice mounted up well and seem to hold position well so far.  I think the one draw back to any of these style is depending on the direction you have them mounted in relation to the bar is they can rotate with the weight of your foot but these have bee great so far.  Took a couple of days of different adjustments to get them &#34;right&#34; but that is more a product of the amount of ways they can be adjusted than any knock on the product.  So far very please especially with the almost 100 dollar savings of similar name brand pegs.
B000CGHR76|5|Great part & OEM!! Exactly what I needed.
B00429Y8ZI|4|Fit well in cup holder.  Got it for my husband for when he rides in my car.
B00VJTEZ98|5|Great
B001JT33LY|5|nice cover, used on our tractor.  good delivery
B00Q27KP1Y|5|great ...no alarm..yes yes!!!!!!!!!!
B001AXGT7O|5|Was extremely easy to install and came with two methods to use (ie on the roller or on the trailer). I used the trailer application which works perfectly.
B002BVXM92|5|It took two bottles costing $40.  Much better than the $2000 replacement of the catalytic converters.
B00KTSPAFI|5|Love it and you get instructions!
B000BUQODG|5|EASILY Installed!!!!
B000EQ6FHC|5|Second set of these I've had.  The first set had to get replaced after 36k miles due to a brake rotor that broke since I wasn't going to use old pads on new rotors and they still had maybe 2/3 of their life left.  They last long, don't make a lot of brake dust, don't squeal and stop great.  Perfect replacements for my Mazda 3.
B000A0EJAW|3|It fit in my car's engine so I guess it's the right one. Price wasn't too bad and delivery was quick.
B0002SA1ZO|1|[[VIDEOID:613b0fd20bece80bd0931c5750c8f0d3]]Video uploaded on 7/26/2016 - after multiple fails at getting a top that fits.<br /><br />First one I ordered took over a month to get here... think they had to make the thing. It did not fit... peachy.<br />Returned that one and ordered another of the same... the second one did not fit either. And it did not fit in the exact same place/manner... couldn't get the snaps to fasten... improper alignment.<br />So, got in touch with Bestop/Pavement Ends... They were going to try and get to the bottom of the 'situation' ... haven't heard a peep from them.<br />Par for the customer no service course I guess. It's pretty obvious that they had to make a production run for my rig as it's older and the 'batch' has the same issue all the way through, misaligned snaps.<br />Good luck to all who order this product.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Worth every penny! These are super bright lights! My Tundra is lifted so these lights are not very friendly to some because they are right in their view, but that's fine with me. Best thing I like- really shines up the road signs!! If you're one of these people always struggling at night reading signs, your struggle is over with these babies! Easy to install. Plug and play. They have their own cooling fan to extract heat and I think this a very cool feature!
B00GVVY7TW|5|Color is a very good match.  I have not used the clear coat yet.
B000C628XE|5|Just what I was looking for and response was super
B0041RZEKY|5|Looks exactly like Cub Cadet beige. I used it to paint a rim on my Cub Cadet mower.. Looked great!
B00J4S2QL0|5|Ordered to replace the same pads I've worn out on my KLR650. I have been happy with those. I had some question about the parts I received from Amazon as they were unexpectedly - 1) colored black and 2) stamped with G1651. I actually reordered from Amazon and got the same thing, so I queried Galfer tech support and was told -<br />&#34;The G1532 compound and G1651 compound are actually the same thing. They will vary in color from green to black or even purple depending on the batch. The variance comes from the fact that certain colors/compounds are for the domestic Spanish market, and some are for export. US regulations allow our factory in Spain to ship us pretty much anything as their stock and production allows. I can assure you that the pads you received are the “Kevlar/Green” compound that you ordered, and will perform the same as the green color pads.&#34;
B0016IJ7PE|5|Perfect fit
B005ASY23I|5|So far so good! I've used this on 4 occasions to air up my tank, tires etc.  I do like how long the line and the cord is.  I wish it came with a bag to keep it in, no biggie...they sell them on amazon too.  I wouldn't hesitate buying a second one for my other ride.  This one stays in the truck.
B00CTLGSZO|1|The camera stop working after two days. the lights to my trailer after installing the set up.
B0049EY6YE|5|O E M..so what is not to like..Great price and fast delivery with Prime..
B006E0OXDU|5|It's the best gasket I've ever used until now, thanks for all.<br />Mr. Clerk<br />Engineer & Certified Mechanic
B00429NKWK|5|I bought 2 kits after speaking with professional automobile restorers. This product isnt sold in my local stores in Reno, and Amazon had the best price online. It took less than 30min to do the headlights on my Sequoia. I also did the headlights on my daughter's Prius. The headlight output now is approx 4x brighter on each vehicle. I'm really happy with this product... and, it was half the cost of having it done at my local car wash & wax retailer.
B00HE66RNM|1|I got the wrong color
B012Y9YB7C|1|You should be ashamed of yourself!  I could have printed better on my ink jet.  AVOID THIS CHEAP JUNK!
B00K30NBOY|5|Delivery was prompt, scissor jack was exactly as advertized. Used it already and I am impressed with the stability of my Heritage Softail when I lifted both wheels off the ground (8&#34;). Great price too. I have no reservation now about doing business with this store.
B001RKH7FS|5|Cord broke on us after using it for 2 years.  I called customer service and was able to get a replacement cord off of their website.
B004HA0842|5|Perfect for my Corvette
B00O9H0QIG|5|very good product, Had one  installed and works just fine, kept 2nd one as a back up. thanks
B000SL4AA2|4|Slow but works really well for filling up a compact car.
B00FSAV5LU|4|I am not a pro or an expert who understands anything special on car cleaning. I bought this new Honda Civic and I was scared of taking my car to car wash. So I read hundreds of review and decided to buy chemical guys product. I use this spray with microfiber cloth as shown in the video and have been following all basic and expert level tips. My experience says this spray cleaning cannot work on heavy dirty mud or bird s*** and all. It just helps in getting off the dust. It works like a duster.    What I started doing, i take my car to self car cleaning there I wash my car with only water and I use microfiber cloth for drying and then I spray this liquid and again I wipe it with microfiber cloth. My car shines good and it makes me feel good that I am taking care of my car. If I am doing it right or wrong ... I really don't know but my car looks good!!
B008NOMBUW|5|worked perfect....Using it in my race car...nice and bright.
B00HE1BQTM|5|Perfect match, easy to install. Very satisfied!
B00Y1HUJYK|5|they work perfect very easy to program
B00VURN30Q|1|Attention attention!!!!buyers beware this is not a real engrade license plate is like fake black frame with taping of 350z. This is false advertisement!!! It deserve no stars!!!!!!!
B000NJ7KUQ|4|great deal for $130, don't &#34;hug&#34; up to the bottom of the cab, but functional
B001KR6HRC|5|Fit great.
B011RZ16Z4|5|Good deal!
B003DMFDM2|3|So I have had this rack about 2 months now.  I like the look, and it was relatively easy to install.  However, one of the upright pieces came with no threads for the bolts that attach it to the base and crossbar.  I had to run to the hardware store and buy a tap and handle to fix it before I could finish assembling the rack!  Added an extra hour and a half, since I live 20 minutes from the nearest hardware store.<br /><br />Next the finish (paint) scraps off whenever I slide my ladders up onto the rack.  The paint on my Rackit rack lasted for years of major abuse, so I am not very happy with this one.
B007PV99RM|4|good stuff
B006DYAZ4I|5|Great pads, no squeals.
B0000AZ7KR|4|Works as advertised.  Just be sure you  get the right size.
B001AX65QO|5|you get what advertised
B00DGYYDTQ|3|I guess I was expecting something different. Book seems to be OK but I guess the way its laid out and the info is not what I was expecting. I'm not saying its bad by any means but I was expecting the information to be told differently.
B003SYJ4SY|5|Just works fine! Came with bulb too!
B00EE56UAG|5|Works like a charm.
B000E7WLJW|5|Worked very well for our 3 hour trip. Held 3 suitcases when combined with our aluminum hitch carrier from Harbor Freight Tools.
B00VBK7GEG|5|Good
B00WVJQO58|5|Seems just as bright as HIDs, easy drop-in installation and the small ballasts fit inside a very small Triumph-style streetfighter headlight housing.  Only time will tell how durable they are, but getting them up and running was a breeze.
B00LIU6Q1I|5|Fit perfectly in a 2001 Accord Sedan
B00COYNWOQ|5|Great love it!
B00SSMOS5U|4|This fits the car windshield well.  I've only had it for a month and it has done it's job so far.
B00JBVB1W0|5|These lights make it look like daylight in the middle of the night
B00KTIDLGI|5|Worked on a 2007 Trailblazer.  Easy instructions and took a very short time to program.
B00G71FJNE|1|Needs more than sanding.<br />Cutting and making the shape where it meets the car is needed. surface like it was made by hand or with a mop.<br />not cost effective.not like the picture in the add, pictures attached.<br /> not good for getting in and out of your driveway. Not practical to make it look like add, might be a lifetime project.<br />Came without grilles on left or right, BIG HOLES. holes on what i got seem much larger than picture.(IT'S NOT REALLY, U JUST SEE SOOOO MUCH THROUGH THEM IT MAKES THEM LOOK BIGGER IN REAL LIFE)<br />There is a lip to mount it, but some a flimsy little strip. there are holes to mount the air blocking panel below / behind the air dam.<br />Have body experience and tools, but not planning to devote that many hours for this cover when I could get a working one more cost effectively.
B005M3A8B6|5|Necessary to mount the running boards.  But not only a necessity, they add nice detail to the boards and make the vehicle look stylish and not overdone.
B00EYNBG4S|5|Great fit
B008BVNMX2|1|Didn't fit at all
B000EQPUF0|5|good
B00D8RTDG4|5|It worked perfectly to remove a very stubborn steering wheel on a golf cart
B00KTHZMPM|5|Exactly as advertised. Worked perfectly!!
B00JA3BMDW|5|Has many uses. Read other reviews that says it is not exact. I have no idea how to verify the accuracy, but for what I need, it tells me the difference in temperature.
B00NVBW5EY|4|Good products. Just like it
B003Z9UUUS|5|Fits really nicely on my 2013 Ram 1500 Express Quad cab 6.4ft bed. Couldn't have asked for anything better - Shipped fast, excellent product.
B002R1097O|2|Update.  I ordered these in November 2013 and installed them a short time later.  It is August 2015 and these headlights have been showing signs of water intrusion for about a month now.  With any driving in rain or car wash.  The truck sits under cover at the office and garaged at night so this is a bit disappointing considering the OE units lasted me almost 8 years.  I know the saying goes you get what you pay for and these were about 1/2 the cost of new OE ones but they came up well under half the life.  If you are simply looking to sell your car in a few months or are looking for a short term solution these will work well but if long term use is your goal I highly advise going with OEM replacement parts.
B001TKA3ES|5|I can't wait to put in our van window!!
B004SG55WK|5|Perfect fit for lexus ls460 2007
B008BYQ880|3|This is ok. The piece that connects the headphone/mic wires to the actual Sena device does not have the clip that holds it in securely. It keeps falling out. It's is a temporary fix if you can't find a better one. I'd advise another with the clip that holds it securely if you can get it.
B001U8QS9I|5|GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY
B00Q87PV6M|1|rips really easily but only paid around $3 so you get what you pay for.....
B00XPTH4RU|5|Appears to be identical to the OEM I removed, maybe an OEM manufacturer that is selling in re-packaged boxes?  In any case it fit right on and worked perfectly.  Comes with the mounting foam gasket as well, thought it's usually easy enough to transfer the original one over.  I can't tell any difference between the one I took off and this one that replaced it in either appearance or function.  I have a 2005 F350.
B003EOXJ4S|3|If you have mechanical aptitude then you will be 100% satisfied with this item.  They really look good and the quality of the actually rails are solid.  However the included hardware does not fit.  The 10mm bolts will not fit through the 10mm washer, you will have to drill out the center of the washer a little.  This isn't difficult if you have the correct size drill bit and a drill.  Also the 6mm washer are too small and will go through the body weld.  I had to furnish my own larger washers.  Like I said, once they are installed they look great or just have to use some ingenuity to get them on.
B00HY31K7S|4|You have to use the adhesive Velcro to install it. When the seats are down there is about 4 inches left exposed of the back of the seat.
B003CJPSW6|5|All good A+
B00ELHNIHK|5|Works great in our 1999 Chevy Lumina, which currently has 267,000 miles!
B0009NUG66|4|As described, worked with siderails only as I do not have cross bars on my gmc.  Bought the skid pad too which is absolutely necessary as the bag didn't move at all. A good buy!
B007N69IRA|5|Gun workes great .<br />I find the cup a bit big I only do small repairs like a bumper or a fender at a time .but over all for the price I give it a five star.
B005ESTAR2|4|good!!!!
B0015PI7A4|5|The 2 times I've used it, it worked perfectly! I had to use it once on my wife's car and once on my daughters car. It helped diagnose a alternator charging problem and a low amperage problem (under load) with a battery.
B00RDNG1CS|5|This system is 35W and not ideal for bright illumination. I changed the bulb to a 55W from PIAA and its ssooooo much better. The housing is metal and the lens is glass which screamed quality when I picked it up. I use it on my lifted 98 ram and it made a huge difference in visibility. Would buy again easily
B007GMHTQ8|5|Looks and feels strong all hardware included to mount into a stock rack. I just thought it would be bigger. Perfect for a mid size SUV though.
B000H0RBWS|1|Works great
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Just what I needed for the higher-pressure trailer tires.
B001G6JYM2|5|As  shown
B00VSHL0T4|5|Well made . Also came with bolts.
B0002MABGE|3|It does not secure properly. It gets the job done, however if my dog was smart engough to push on it, I would have a different opinion.
B00FMPSJX8|3|Its ok.  Not a ton of room, but enough to store a wallet and maybe a smaller phone.
B000IYR5M4|2|Did not fit properly. I did not have time to send it back, order another, and then install. Especially since the truck was apart when I find out this one was too wide. I did make it fit, but its not pretty and may cause issues down the road. 2002 Chevy Silverado 1500 LS.
B002XMP45O|5|Great product.
B003WT6XCA|5|Best to load up lowered Ford GTs.
B00EEGC1G2|5|easy install and looks great...
B002PQU4K8|5|Fits and looks great.  Seems to be better than original equipment.  Great price too!
B000P3WWC6|5|fits and works.....hard to take off in the winter
B00BX96PHO|4|so far so good. 100 miles. will update if problems. For the money good chain kit
B0060YHRQK|4|Good tie down for my 1998 Subaru Forester. Wing nuts and j-hook threads were strong enough to hold battery in place during Rally Cross events with no tray underneath of it.
B00M0TLQ6Q|5|Great product, works as advertised and has handy basket included!
B00S67X0YM|1|Junk don't buy this product horrible reception
B00X5S13E6|5|Exactly the same as lights costing twice as much. have installed them on 2 trucks and 1 car with excellent results.
B006NZTZLQ|5|I can connect every time.  Faster than the cheap units.  Sleep mode keeps car battery safe.
B009IXNL8I|2|THIS WAS THE WRONG PUMP .
B00353M08E|4|Not as embarrassing as asking your wife for her panty hose.
B004BTAJ2A|3|Very hot in Arizona Sun....but looks great and sporty...
B00YB5GAEA|5|super bright and rechargeable long lasting tail light!
B009YXV41S|5|As advertised. Representative of 29yrs of service to my country & my Marine Corps. Very professional.
B00EOE2L6O|4|Good price,,, directions were backward... the plastic foot step trim also  pops loose easily
B00YB5GAEA|1|The light is not bright and the mount is notI have trouble getting the light to stay attached to the rubber mount. It has fallen off more than once. Not worth purchasing.
B00SQQIIGI|2|too flimsy
B000C31J9G|5|A+  all the way..
B006E2PKN0|4|easy to replace
B000C9ULDK|5|Good quality filter
B00HQT2N44|5|Quality product very easy to install!!!  Add a great look to my f-150!!!
B008OY2K1Q|5|First class service. First class material.
B00EAB1H20|5|EXCELLENT QUALITY
B004XG3PEA|4|would be better if there was a better way to anchor the wheel studs into the bracket, tack welded mine
B001LTXMA4|4|perfect fit.
B00M492HB0|5|Identical look to the factory 2003 Expedition switch and works well including the factory green LED lights (which had burned out on mine in addition to other quirky window issues).
B002AUFVWA|5|works great, got rid of speaker noise
B000BQW5LK|4|worked well
B00C5SNQYM|5|as promised
B009XQHTP6|2|Read the reviews prior to purchasing.  I received one of the used items another review was referring to.  When I opened the brown box from Amazon the first thing I noticed immediately was that the box had been opened multiple times prior.  The tab at the top was curled as you can see in the pictures.  Then I opened the box and saw the bag.  I remember thinking to myself, nice maybe I will be ok. Then I unzipped the bag and was really disappointed. The first thing I noticed was a plastic bag that had something in it originally was ripped open and noting in it.  There was also a cut zip tie in the bag as well.  Then when I looked at the unit the rubber guard had been pulled back.  I was surprised that Amazon's quality control didn't catch this one...or maybe they did and hoped I would keep the unit and not send it back.  The item was clearly a return from another customer that someone tried to put back in rotation.  I would spend about $20 and get an upgrade.  I tried this one out and it matched my dashboards tire read out on my Escalade...so I return the Viair and bought the &#34;Astro Pneumatic 3018 3-1/2-Inch Digital Tire Inflator with Hose&#34;.  Good luck!
B00U0AA5FU|5|Factory fit no issues
B00C88ALWE|5|Works great
B0002SRL20|5|You just can't beat these old school tire inflators.  My last one lasted 40+ years, and this doesn't look any different.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
B000E2CVIS|5|Thanks
B007UHPX6C|5|looks great.
B000Z0HVHA|4|Works as expected.
B00XQJMVTU|5|I put these on my 2004 fatboy and they work great and they look good on the bike. Have had them on my bike for about a month and so far so good. Put about 3000 miles riding cross country. Once I got them adjusted and tightened down haven't had to adjust since. Would recommend them to a friend.
B000C8RD3M|5|cable fit number one, I guess I ordrered the right one. Shipping was ok right on time.
B000FW7UBA|4|This product works well and the effects are long-lasting. There is a certain petroleum smell, but I wouldn't let that dissuade you from buying it.
B0027SIJX8|4|Fits it perfectly but, like other people have said, plastic seems flimsy but isn't.
B011S318OY|3|Not what I really was expecting a lil to big for a 4runner.but will due for now OEM will fit better!
B00D7T4LX8|4|Cute and easily held
B008G1XADY|5|Delivered as promised! Awesome!
B00838808A|5|A+
B000OAG2DK|3|I like it much better then the nice but very heavy one that I had ,it was so slippery and would fall and make bruises .If I could recommend to put groves in the handle it would be a 5 stars. If you make one I will buy it
B00P1RU8PY|5|Strong stuff. Good buy.
B0002MID28|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B009X3TL8M|3|product appears to only last 1-3 days.. should last a month, at least..
B001DRNNKI|5|Easy replacement for my 2010 Jetta, fits perfectly and noticeably cleaner air in my car
B00KL3ALGO|5|Fast service. Great product.
B00RJUZY9Q|5|was a great gift
B00FEX9QPS|5|Modded to fit 2015, perfect look too
B00MJUXSSK|5|Great product works as described
B00RHQBQKI|4|but I love the convenience for the car. The tube fits in a cup holder. I was going to buy a tube of Pringles and make my own, then found these on Amazon. A little scratchy, but not a problem for occasional use. Arrived in a 3-pack and I ordered refills, and I think they will last a long time.
B00KTI01DE|3|I had to place tape around the battery cover since it keeps falling off.
B00ARF6FB6|1|Worked fine a couple of days and didn't work anymore.
B0024NWX4C|5|These replacement headlights were great! They were as good as when car lights were brand new.  Awesome product for the price.
B00EJYAWS8|4|Kinda pricey for a sticker but looks cute and as expected, took a while to ship but that's no biggy for something simple like a decal.
B000IZ3K4U|5|No issues...fast delivery...easy install.  feeling the ac now.
B005FKSBEC|5|Just what I needed for my 2010 Impala. Great set, and aside from rotors and pads, this set also includes new clips to hold the pads in and new rubber dust boots for the mounting bolts.
B000AMD18Q|1|The miror in poor quality ,do not use it , frome the miror you can see a distorted ,very high price
B008402YXE|4|Could be just a tiny more space between the wheel and the bottom rails.  Great product overall.
B0058FEW4W|5|Good
B00IO9AW8O|5|Thanks for everything, I like so much
B0002STSQ2|5|Got it and it works. It is a tub.
B00F06GMCY|1|These bulbs lasted nowhere near 5500 hours. I was very good about only running them at night when needed but they still burnt out much sooner than expected. This is the second set that has done this to me. The ballasts from this company however, have outlasted two sets of bulbs.
B0021LQ3PM|5|ok
B0049E7FG0|5|What can you say about AC  Dye,  It is a great thing and it works
B00ESLBRU4|5|Specific and safe. Would recommend it to anybody doing a conversion.
B008F8Q8R8|5|Dad really liked these and got several compliments on them.
B00H03GLJE|2|Smaller than I was thinking. Little disappointing.
B00LP80N5I|4|Works fine. Not life-changing. Good for cleaning wheels. It comes with a quick disconnect fitting installed which you can remove with a wrench. Once the fitting is removed, you can screw it onto any US garden hose.
B00UMQ5P8O|5|This was easy to install and looks great on the jeep
B010C37TIU|5|Easy to put on and it doesn't blow away like the last one I bought when it's windy out.  Love that it has a underside clip to lock it in place.
B005BWI9SC|5|Works perfectly in my 05 Elantra at a fraction of the store cost for OEM. Thanks for saving me a ton!
B00JK322MW|5|Very nice cables don't twist and turn like this product very much
B00KTLA2U8|5|Exactly the same as the one I pulled out of my 1995 Honda Accord 2.7 -- no longer overheating!
B002US3ZE8|5|Every thing was fine.
B00G4F2F7Q|1|I purchased this product a few months ago and have used it a number of times for sublimation. the image that was sublimated on the tag was dull each time. I return to a company that is more expensive to get the results that I wanted. It should be noted that I used a number of types of sublimation papers and got the same results.
B000VL6AHU|5|We need a great air filter for the cars' interior as we live in the Arizona desert and dust storms are common.  Wix helps us breath clean air, regardless of the outside particulates.
B00EPA7CZC|5|All worked great. very bright. will purchase them again to finish the rest of the 194 bulbs in my car
B00M42DQPS|5|Fit perfectly on my Tundra 2014 Crew Max. Good size and looks epic. Delivery was good too. Good packaging.
B0006H8NS8|5|Great seat covers. Fit well and made well.
B004INE1SC|5|Works as well as OEM designed it
B007O0MXSQ|3|Cheap quality plastics, especially the side shrouds. They did not fit properly and took a lot of rough and tough to get them bolted on. Color is great, very pink.
B00WV1TYEE|5|Can't beat the price + it looks great!  Installing is some what tricky without removing the bumper cover because the way the grill is mounted...  But a great looking grill.
B008NMWQ6I|5|Installation was somewhat of a struggle attached the mount to the top frame rail I had to but 1 1/2 &#34; long bolts. The 1&#34; bolts provided was hard to get threaded into the bracket. The driver side top frame rail mounting hole was partially obstructed with brake lines. It took me a couple hours to get one bolt threaded. That is when I purchased longer bolts. After that I got the top frame mounts done at about 15 minutes each fro the remaining three bolts.
B00TEB0C0E|4|I was expecting it to be more like an actual license plate but it feels like sheet metal printed on top. it is nice but I wish I would have known the print wasn't dented.
B00KL3ALGO|5|I drive a route on which the sun shines through the driver's side window roasting me and blinding me. This is exactly what I needed. It shields me from the sun adequately, while still allowing me to see out the window to drive safely. I can remove it and reapply it while driving. It folds up easily into a small pouch.
B00RWO6HSG|5|On the ocean with fog and rain, the light bar blasts light out making my presence known to other boaters. Better than I expected.
B00FXK446S|3|They are ok.  I wish they were brighter and more white.<br />They project a strange bluish pattern.  For the money I cannot complain.
B000UXV9VG|5|Fits perfectly!! Quick delivery, too.
B004LSVG7I|5|They were better than I expected. I was looking for a nice pair of goggles for a motorcycle trip, I was too cheap to buy a pair that I couldn't try on so I ended up trying these. They aren't the nicest, they do have the cheap soft foam, but for the price I consider them a good deal they held up pretty nice over the corse of a 4300 mile motorcycle trip I wore the tinted or the yellow pretty much the whole time. They were wide enough to not block your vision on the sides. The foam is breaking down on the tinted but I wore them almost all day for 9 days, with sunscreen and sweat. Overall I would recommend them and will probably buy them again instead of a nicer pair that cost 10x more per pair.
B002UJVNFA|3|The quality of the glasses is pretty much what I expected. Unfortunately they didn't sent me the smoke tinted ones. I got 2 clears and a yellow, not the end of the world but it would have been nice to get the sunglasses.
B00F47Z2J8|5|Easy and quick install.
B00VKMFPZC|5|Item is in brand new condition with all tags, etc.  Perfect!!
B0089LSZC2|5|When I replaced the filter I matched it up to the old one that I removed and they were exactly the same. The old one was installed by the dealership so I'm confident it was an OEM replacement part. The filter was actually yellow, which matched the old one as well. When I first received it I thought maybe it was a little beat up because the folds in the filter weren't exactly straight, but again that is how the old one was as well.
B0007XTGCI|4|Chains could be a bit longer.
B00N6CVHQK|5|Fixed my problem. Gas gauge working like it's supposed to.
B0033YFEQA|5|works well on ford explorer. Plenty of power. Easy install. Harness clips right in.
B003WLWEPI|5|Bright shinny red but not the correct color for my Troy bilt tiller.
B00F17Q87G|5|geat for the RV
B004BL71TC|5|They are light bulbs.  They light up just like they are supposed to.<br />Delivery was fast.  No issues
B009AUVF5U|5|perfect OEm replacement. Fit great, easy install, works well.
B00BP5QN32|3|Man this thing looks so cool...until you put it on and you look like Marvin Martian. It's so big. Helmets seem to keep getting bigger and bigger. It was comfy while I test fit it but I went with something more sleek (see my other review).
B00J5EYWAG|4|Seems to do a good job at  supporting my back while driving. Only been on the road 2 days with it but but really feels like it's doing a great job. Very comfortable also.
B000N9N3SO|1|Do not buy these.  I bought them for a 1982 Evinrude and they do not seat on the spark plugs.
B00BEH5WFQ|4|Shaft worked out fine
B000C5UFQM|5|Denso is the best sensor period
B00M3NEBMK|5|Excellent
B00UC1Z6B0|4|Fitment can be a little tricky. Use the water method.
B000BUQOEU|5|Does a wonderful job in the wind!  &#34;Great&#34;
B00SVYKAVQ|5|Quite pricy, but love the fit and the look.  I definately made the right choice.
B0029XLPVE|5|OTC makes quality special tools.  Sometimes the only choice.
B000E8T83S|5|Great oil filter. Made of great quality. fits my saturn S-series perfectly and larger then the stock filter so you can hold more oil
B0031OXHAM|5|We got this for our RV. Fits perfectly and mailed out quickly<br />thanks
B00CU79L9M|4|Great glasses. They have a flexible hinge which makes them comfortable to wear. I wish they were  a little larger in the lens, but for the price they are a steal!!!
B0050DCA4Q|5|Very pleased with the Kuryakyn 1609 Passenger Grab Rail. My wife really likes the wide handles with rubber lining.<br />We ride in the Blue Ridge Mountains most weekends. It has really helped her hands. Definitely would recommend this product.
B000LNIVWU|5|If you are running a TDI or any other diesel and are frustrated by the mileage drop because of the lowered cetane rating in fuel. Buy this product and add six once to each tank and your mileage will come right back up, as will your performance.  With the governments addition of ethanol to all fuels, gasoline and diesel, mileage and performance degrade as does engine life.  Yes, they add it to all diesels to lower the sulfur content.  You need something like Redline's 85plus to restore your TDI to its original specs.  A definite must.
B00ECGP5E4|4|I am very happy with these. Good product for the price. The only complaint I have is that the button to set the clock is recessed a little to far and it is difficult to set, not that big of a deal since you don't have to set the clock to often.
B001H3NGKA|5|👍🏼
B008D15U8U|5|Very Pleased
B00WJ05RPM|5|I am very pleased and happy with the product
B00OFM757K|5|This product came in on time and was exactly what I was expecting
B008I62UE2|5|Great product.
B0065MYGF2|5|I had my father in law's 1990 Ranger repainted and I needed to really make it shine while putting on a good first wax coat. Meguiars has always been a good company that offers many options for cleaning and finishing your vehicle and with this kit you have everything you need to clean anything with paint on it in your garage. First of all is the quality of the Porter Cable random orbit polisher that has adjustable speed. It comes with a &#34;velcro&#34; backing buffer wheel that the foam pads attach to. There are many companies that offer foam pads: Chemical Guys, AMMO, just to name two, and going to their YouTube channels will give you the information you'll need to use the correct pad. The two pads that are enclosed, the peach and the black, are two of the most common nap's. The peach is used primarily to start the process of applying wax and the black would be used to remove any burnishing marks. The microfiber towels are used to remove dust at the end of your project. Once your wax is on the car, you will be amazed how easy it is to clean it the next time you wash it. Dirt seems to just roll off with the water.<br /><br />Yes the price is high, but if you really want a &#34;system&#34; to shine that automobile or motorcycle or anything that needs polishing, these are the tools you will need to get there. You can't do it with your hands and a rag, it's nearly impossible.
B00BTGSGFK|5|they work fine, although a bit small...
B00REJXDJA|5|Great product, no issues with delivery, turned up within days of ordering. Simple and easy to install, looks great on the truck. Would definitely recommend this product to others.
B008MQ38EY|5|I installed this engine in a Hammer head go kart.  I had to make some small modifications, but it runs great. Thanks
B000IG200O|3|Eh... These are ok considering what we paid for them.  Should have read the description closer.  Expected them to be bigger.
B00P1NXYL8|5|2015 GTI - does what it is supp to do
B008RDL78G|4|Installed really easy and does a great job hauling my two (very heavy) plastic paddle boards.<br /><br />One of the end caps fell off on my first journey.  It still functions fine, but that is the reason for 4 out of 5 vs. 5 stars.
B008AI3AL0|5|Very professional seller. Great product. Highly recommend it.
B00KOHHLTW|5|Great product and so easy to use. I remapped my bike after installing the Monster Squared slip-ons. The unit did need to download some updates before it was ready. It took about 10 minutes to complete its updates.
B00CZDOFU6|5|Awesome sticker pack for my kid
B0002Z9O8C|5|Fit perfectly on my 2009 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.
B000CF1WB4|5|Fits exactly as OEM and over 125 bucks cheaper.  A complete steal!
B00E9FS3QK|5|Arrived on time fits and works great
B00U0UWOZO|5|I love these. They arrived to the house nicely packaged and oh so shiny. Well, the quality is just great. I mean these are just solid full metal. It's got some weight to it. The logo just looks fantastic. I have these on my mercedes Benz. I wanted something subtle to show being a fan and be grown up at the same time. I recommend these products in whatever logo you would like.
B0006IX87S|5|Works good.  Now we feel safe drinking the water when we go camping.
B00DFANZNG|5|Worked like a champ and was very impressed by the quality of the product. Bonus: Shipping was fast also. Thank you.
B001A1PPBM|1|Junk.  Third time I put them on they ripped right down the palm (seamed opened up).
B000WG9PJY|4|Another very good kit.just get your own bit.
B000G2OY7M|5|Mechanic said it was the easiest harness he's ever wired.
B000GZPGYE|1|did not work on my virago 750...
B002PWD39G|1|Never got it to work.
B000TYLIFS|5|Five days after installation, it continues to perform very well. Glad I decided to install.<br />Recommend for older models that did not come w Multi port injection.
B00HRH9H9O|5|OK.
B00W6IYCC6|2|To thin don't fit over mirror JUNK I took them out tried them and they are cheap.
B0041TU56A|5|easy install
B003VGOBBY|5|Quick shipment.  This light looks and works great!
B001V8U12M|5|Excellent.  Makes camper set up must faster and easier!!!!
B00X013OIG|4|It cover very good
B00498YGJA|5|Another great suspension part that far exceeds OEM quality made by Moog. Even has a greasable joint on it. Remember to always buy the Made in USA products made by Moog. They do have a more inexpensive line but are junk compared to their Made in USA products.
B00BITKRRI|5|Item was as described, would consider purchasing again.
B000EOJ5VC|5|Perfect replacement part. Quick shipment and reasonably priced.
B00IOU1BPQ|5|You can definitely feel a difference on the low end of gears. Sounds great too.
B0018JXII8|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B0091YWA22|4|Like the way they look. Good price.
B003YM8YMM|2|Stitching came out on one end. Strictly used via drivers side roll bar on my Jeep JK. The roll bar straps are not long enough.
B00317046Y|5|fit well<br />fast ship
B010RIDERU|5|Truth...stranger than fiction
B000BLJHHU|5|Fit my 2004 Jeep Sport very well.
B00755JMYS|5|Exactly what i ordered just wish the where a little skinner to install in my door lights.
B003SZLWD8|5|Worked and fit perfectly
B004N78RQK|5|This cover fit the seat on my 84 200X perfectly.  The front of the seat actually fits into a &#34;pocket&#34; sewn into the material, then you stretch it over the rest of the seat and staple it to the pan.  There are no staples or loose material visible in the area between the seat and the gas tank, which is nice.
B003TESNQM|4|I had to modify the holes to get it to fit on the studs, but other than that, it's better than looking at that ugly EGR.
B005OLD7XW|1|Glue does not hold , within a day or two it started falling down , I had to keep sticking it back to the mirror everytime I stop. I like the concept of this product but if the glue can't hold on the mirror then come up with alternative like Velcro. Until then this product is just a waste of money
B007JEJQP0|5|The product is well made and fairly easy to install with a basic set of tools. I used a floor jack to lift it into place and did not use ramps to lift the vehicle so it was a little tight under there. I agree with the other reviews on leaving the plastic panel in place and cutting it on the vehicle. The plastic panel is thin and cuts easily with a sharp utility knife so I really don't see the need to use a dremel tool for the job. Cut the plastic into a flap as described in the other reviews and you can finish by removing only a thin strip about 3/8&#34; wide and taping the rest back up to the vehicle and hitch. I used a small pry bar, the recommended 5/8&#34; open end wrench and some WD-40 to remove the rubber isolators and drop the muffler/exhaust but you could use almost anything to pry them loose. You will also need a 17mm socket, a 11/16&#34; socket, a ratchet and extensions. A torque wrench would be helpful but not required. I happened to have a cheap one from HF on hand so I used it to be sure that the fasteners were close to the desired tightness. The 48 to 50 ft lbs. specified in the instructions is fairly tight for hand tools with short handles so you'll need to pull a little to snug the fasteners down properly. When reinstalling the muffler/exhaust, take note that the inboard rubber isolator must go through the notch in the hitch. I had to have it on the vehicle first and then slide the muffler hanger into it second.
B00BPFIROK|5|Identical look to the factory 2003 Expedition switch and works well including the factory green LED lights.
B00JIBFMY6|5|Nice product. Company has been great to send addition support materials via email.
B00HB0WUB4|4|I switched to RID-X after seeing a major RV help channel discuss it in an online video.  Up to that point, I was using drop-ins with either limited success, or with worries about if the drop-ins were working via biological or chemical enhancement.  RID-X has been amazing in breaking down wastes, waste paper and allowing the dump station visit to be all the more pleasant.  My issue is the scent -- strong; almost overpowering.  Storing the bottle in the bathroom vanity, and returning to the trailer after a day out the entire space smells as if I plugged air fresheners into every available outlet and kept them all on high.  The fragerance seems to penetrate the plastic of the bottle.  Today, I store the bottle inside two closed/locked freezer bags and store it in my outside locker; and I still experience a whiff if the ceiling fans are on, drawing are in via windows and locker vents.  If only they would make a non-scented version, I would rate 5+.
B00UZE88Z0|5|Use this stuff in my garage everyday.
B001JT5KSS|5|Good quality lights. Excellent replacement for my Ford Tractor. Work as supposed too, very nice is high power and deemed light option. Overall - very good product.
B002I2T8FG|5|Love the decal.  I cut it up and placed it on my Kindle cover.
B00UXUXUZE|5|If you drive a VW/Audi TDI this is the oil you need.
B000J2JED8|5|good price! don't think ill need more than 10 of these for the life of my truck.
B001KYTUGA|5|We use this stuff to take care of baby diaper and cat litter odors and it works great. It doesn't just mask the smell, it actually gets rid of it and it smells pretty good unlike some other sprays that smell like chemicals.
B00Q3B12Y8|5|Very pleased with the quality of AEM products, wouldn't expect anything less. A must for any boosted vehicle
B001IH8Q0A|5|Heavy duty hitch receiver and a great price.
B00MWNZ4LS|1|Its is not good , it was damaged after using 2 times. The clip is not fitting properlyy
B00MEVO6YY|5|pretty.
B00AC6ZCYQ|5|You can put a lot of crap in this thing LOL
B00SUTHIVM|5|Perfect for what I needed.
B00LK35H4U|5|Fast delivery, super easy to install and loved that it came with the torch wrench tool.  Plus the price is less then getting through dealer that was $260 bucks.
B005QY9G5K|1|Very disappointed--Item not as described.  Product description specifically says &#34;Packaged 10 per box for customer convenience&#34;, though only 1 was shipped.
B00M38VKG0|4|Works well, as a replacement.
B008XSGYPQ|5|Love it
B009DJY7R6|5|Everything was great! Product was at our door within 48hrs.
B008F8Q8K0|5|Works as advertised,  dropped in no problem and came with new bulbs which I didn't expect.  Great product
B00BDJCCT4|5|Fit great look, great thanks
B004ME8MZ0|5|We are very pleased with the extention mirrors.
B000VI071S|1|Junk... didn't work .
B000C94E4M|1|Died a premature, rusty death...X 2....2003 Tacoma<br /><br />I actually bought a second one, but both rusted out very fast....Looking for other options
B009B5SRXC|5|Quality looks good.
B0096BAUCM|5|Great radiator. Direct fit into my 2003 Honda Civic Ex.
B00L1S0JU6|5|By far the best drying towel I have ever used. Did the complete car without wringing it out.
B005J4Y13O|5|good price worked well for riding.
B001G7WRRA|5|Cool
B00HMZEUVG|5|Amazing
B007TG7HVS|5|Exactly what i needed. May be purchasing more in the future. Thanks!
B009IFIKCI|5|Nice fit!
B0031BAAQE|5|exactly what the bike needed..cheapest price anywhere
B00AYZB6Z4|5|Works awesome
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Good deal for a very bright leds. I just placed on the back up lamp and they are really bright.
B003YLMPPA|5|The perfect replacement for my 2006 Jeep Liberty blower motor resistor.  Now my fan runs at all speeds, not just 4.
B000I2SWXC|5|Works great for the back of my 2014 Ram 1500. Use it in combination with a tri fold tonneau cover so I mounted it towards the back of the bed. Most of the time its holding my golf clubs in place by the tailgate and the net works great for golf shoes, a couple boxes of balls, etc.  it also works great for holding luggage in place and the bag is good for groceries and the like. I have found the bar holds in place well, hasnt slipped yet for what I use it for, although i have seen some reviews complaining about it. Would buy again.
B00X9GSA36|1|Worst gear ever
B001RMYHKO|5|They are lights, red and they work! Pretty easy to install too.
B003TTL0TE|3|It's easy to wear yourself out using this, and it doesn't feel good on the hand. I should have bought a sponge instead.
B000KYWDU6|5|It was perfect and was able to get it to work!
B002UCYRYQ|4|Love the cleaner. Haven't had much need for the scratch remover but the cleaner is really good and cleans better than other things I have tried.
B00KWFNXS4|5|it works
B00NP8VBKW|5|Great, great, great!
B00X9IL5RW|5|Great touch to any Lexus! got a lot of compliments.
B0068C4KPK|5|The right oil at a great price!
B000COBWO2|5|I like my vehicles mostly stock, no lifts, no crazy aftermarket stuff. I researched a lot to see what people said and most people said these shocks were too firm/stiff, I disagree. I put these on my 96 regarding cab 4x4 2.7 toyota tacoma and I am highly satisfied. My shocks were shot, these are nice, and great quality shocks. They ride awesome, pretty smooth, not jarring. I would recommend these to anyone.
B0006IX7WY|4|Great to have
B0002MBR6C|3|It's been a couple of months now, I think, and I have had an issue with the driver's rear cover wiggling down; undoubtedly it would fall off if I don't reposition it every now and then.<br /><br />Despite my best efforts I cannot get the fronts installed at all.  Yes, I watched the pointless video, and read the directions.  I'm convinced they are too long for MY 1995 Suburban.  My next plan of attack is to grind/file 1/8 to 3/16&#34; off of the bottom and see how it works - can't be any more useless than they are now.
B00029WYEY|5|Works as advertised.  Really easy to clean your filter.  I put my cleaned filter in front of a fan and it was dry in less than 15 minutes.  All in all, from start to finish, less than 30 minutes of easy work....most of it while holding a cold beer!
B00VO83V94|5|Love the way that the tow hook looks! It is pretty light, and works well!! (We did test it)!<br /> Upon ordering it I received the wrong part, however auto dynasty had very good customer service and helped me out right away, making sure I was satisfied with my experience!
B00K8VQE7Y|5|nice product.
B00Q7TC30I|1|This les no working no on
B010LEVC1A|4|Great. Makes things much easier
B007PT3J7K|5|Works great
B00IIVO3TW|5|great item for a great price, thank you
B00FZQ169S|3|Once I got over the price of this product, it fits and works well. But come on, $25 for a piece of injection mold plastic?!?!? This thing probably cost a nickle to make and most likely made in China and now pennies to make..... Can you say GOUGING the CUSTOMER? Next time I will go to a bone yard and pick one off a junker.
B00MQ19XXQ|5|My family recently purchased a used Mercedes with a cracked mirror, which is a minor issue but an issue none the less! This product fit perfectly into our '98 Mercedes c230 with about 1/16-1/8 space all around the edge which makes the replacement almost unnoticeable! It is a simple product that does its job and does it well. If you want to get a certified Mercedes replacement you end up paying 4-5 times more than this, and sometimes even more which makes this product a great pickup for a quick fix-it solution if you want to save quite a bit of money!
B00XO2CZL8|5|It snapped in 328i perfectly!!
B00NFSNAS8|1|starts smoking after a couple minutes of use... not to mention its very loud, and quite slow. really an overall piece of crap.
B009382HA6|5|Perfect
B007Y85AF6|1|Starter failed just shy of 2 years (2002 Mercury Mountaineer 4.0L). Would not recommend.
B00062ZM3W|4|Worked well, but is an oiled filter which will coat your MAF with oil.
B001OZQEEG|5|I have used this stuff in my 04 ford f250 for a long time and its good stuff. My truck has a 6.0 diesel in it and besides the normal 6.0 stuff the truck (head gaskets due to bad egr and hot summer day pulling  Mountains with fully loaded trailer) runs great. thanks to this oil in my opinion. The truck has 418,xxx miles and still doesnt burn or leak oil and im beting its gana last a while yet
B004GZ4ZRO|4|Works fine driver switch had came out so i used the slide pins from my old one still working great
B002EPBIMI|5|Used these as tube seals for a custom built dana 44 that I made. The ID of the DOM they went into was 2.000&#34; and the axle shaft diameter was 1.312&#34;. They worked as expected.
B00UHF28XU|5|Before the car looked &#34;weak&#34; - if you get my drift - with the wheels so far inside the wheel wells after lowering. At stock height you can't tell at all since the wheel/fender gap is so much more, but now, gap is about 2 finger width, the offset becomes very apparent.<br /><br />Now, have these on my newly lowered 2015 Audi A3 Quattro and and really like the stance now. Makes the car look so much more aggressive and at this price, you can't really go wrong. Would highly recommend over other very absurdly high priced brands out there.<br /><br />If you want incredibly flush, you might want 20MM all the way around, but this did the trick for me.
B001QSZ7XK|5|Looks great
B000BPQGQ6|5|It works well
B00IO7XYD6|5|WE HAD THE KEY CUT AND IT WORKS.
B009D3D6P6|5|had it for about a month now, holds up good and looks geeat!
B000NSHW32|3|did not last -had to replace again after a short time
B002JBM9WA|3|These fog lamps fit perfectly and were a breeze to install. They don't seem to be quite as bright as the originals, but are good enough. I was extremely happy with them, however a few weeks after installing I noticed moisture inside one of them. I would still recommend, but be sure to check the seal on the lense before installing.
B00026Z3E0|5|Great product.  Heavy duty and did the job.
B006FSUFX8|5|Works great.
B000GKD6VY|5|Absolutely LOVE it! Fits perfectly in my 2003 Dodge Ram
B000GTX5HU|5|Was on the hunt for new sprockets on my 1982 Honda XR200R. They fit perfect & were a great price. Delivery was super fast as well - which is important with bike parts.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Arrived on time and works great!
B00EK6NS22|5|// , These work about as well as expected.<br /><br />However, I have some recommendations:<br /><br />1. If they go out, try replacing the batteries.<br />2. These may not work as well with motorcycle tyres, as they will affect the weight balance.<br />3. These can still be attached to motorcycles, just not on the wheels, I guess.<br />4. Don't screw them too loosely or too tightly.<br />5. Their flashing is quite the attention grabber. In that respect, they may be a slight enhancement to vehicle safety, but beware potentially distracting other drivers, of course.
B00I9HGMYO|5|Everyone should have one!
B00AETSLEY|5|Very good cables for a great price. Wire is thick and flexible and clamps are strong
B00AN5UUNY|2|Rotors were warped out of the box.  The brake pads seemed fine.
B00CASDZKC|3|I really like how they lay flat on the back of the seat. But the only problem I have with them is how they attach to the bottom side of your seat. It comes apart easy and you have to take it apart and put the strap back in the buckle.
B00L237SUO|1|Very cheap. Broke within the first week.
B00JBICD8Y|4|Good so far
B00MQKTFG2|5|Car working again speaks for itself
B000E3EXH4|5|I ordered these for a 1997 Ford F250 HD Crew Cab. I wanted a seat cover that would slip on and off easily to protect the factory upholstery from dirt and grime while camping etc. These seat covers are perfect for that and as a bonus they almost look like a factory fit! The fit on my Ford seat looks as good as the picture on Amazon. They install in about 15 minutes total. Slip over the backrest, tuck the flap, slip over the seat bottom, smooth and adjust, hook in the back. You're done!
B0096EDVRA|5|good for putting small stuff on the trunk of my 370z
B0065S6S8Y|5|Direct replacement for what I needed on my Trailblazer.
B000WJE74E|5|Has held up very well in a variety of terrains. Not my favorite tire on hard pack but a really good overall tire. I ran it flat for an hour in a harescramble, still going strong.
B009FNX2EO|5|I love the way it fit my 2011 tundra and the way it looks. Price is good too.
B00LTX840A|5|Exactly what I needed
B00K8VQE7Y|3|I bought this for my 2013 Ram Truck and it don't fit that windshield. It reaches about 90% so I'm cool with that just wish it was a little longer, more for a car than truck
B00E5OUOCQ|5|The sun shade gets the job done - it covers the windshield and keeps the car (especially the steering wheel) from getting too hot. I also like the<br /> storage pocket it came with.
B00BAZCQS8|5|Perfect match. After replacing my old 2003 original Subaru headlights, it produces brighter light than original.
B011GNPULS|5|They are great.  Now I can see in the rain
B004BQEWB2|5|Awesome!
B000QA0SKQ|5|Husband bought these to put on the camper and they work great.  Easy to install and does the job they were meant for.
B00R44MEFE|5|Great light fitting
B00EE1VYRO|5|Fast shipping  worked great ..
B002NEV31G|4|Worked
B000GTW3UU|3|Most parts fit , gaskets seem ok ....
B005DOQYNU|5|Nice set of lights. Much brighter than the dull yellow looking factory bulbs.
B00BYNJ90E|3|Installed on an '01 Sequoia:<br /><br />-1 star for 'fitment.'  Put simply, they don't really fit.  I was hoping for 0 to 1 inch of additional ride height.  After assembling them on the 'third' and 'second' ring settings, I realized that they were far taller than advertised.  The lowest setting resulted in almost 1.5&#34; of lift and required a lot of extra effort to flex the suspension far enough (including reinstalling the spring compressors).<br /><br />-1 star for poor adjustment design.  The snap rings seem to be prone to jumping out of their grooves before the spring seat has fully captured them.  After assembly attempt one, I found one of the rings half way out and severely bent.  If I had put the weight of the car on the assembly it would have ruined the ring and shock.<br /><br />During the initial drive test, damping felt very soft, not the stiff response I was expecting.  This may result in the loss of another star after I can hit freeway speeds and on rougher paths.
B00L8FPSY4|4|They look pretty good once installed.  No directions,  so you'll need to watch a YouTube video to install them correctly.  The Delboy videos were very accurate and helpful...
B000GUWOXK|5|Bought these for our 02 Ultra Classic & they make the ride so much more comfortable!  Install was easy - one small piece of advice though, remove the shocks on BOTH sides before trying to put the new ones on; took us a minute to remember that, but once we did the job went quick.  I highly recommend this company and product.
B00180J29G|5|Great price & quick delivery. Part matched perfectly. Thank you
B000IETT5K|5|My husband said it was very easy to install & only took him five or ten minutes.
B00DDL4GY4|3|Look ok but does not stretch any during installation.  Will try another brand later.
B00V6KI7KS|5|Super soft! I love the distressed look without being grungy. Perfect fit too. (I ordered a small- I'm 5'4, 120 lbs)
B000C3F37A|5|Item was a perfect match to original
B005HR2MXY|5|not bad
B000BQKBP2|5|Does was it is supposed to.  Good price.
B00C566K8I|5|Easiest muffler I have ever installed.
B00EC2CG9U|5|Excellent product.  Strong and durable.  I use these bungees to further tie down/hold tight  my bikes on my bike rack.  Will buy more if needed for other uses.
B004OXR3TK|5|A must have part for your classic car.
B001GEW502|5|Do not hesitate to by these. I loved them
B000OZS9Y0|5|Works great on our side by side,  plan on ordering 2 more sets.  One set  for the back seat and one for the jeep.  Really helps get inside especially if you're short like me.
B000K02EDG|5|Never put after market knock sensors in a gm product. You will pull them back out and replace with ACDelco!
B00IZZDRR0|5|Perfect for getting in and out of my camper.  I was especially grateful for it when we had to lift that side of the camper to level it on an uneven surface.
B006X8AP1C|4|Haven't installed in my truck yet but the quality you get for the price is amazing. Was not expecting such a stout unit for the price. Very pleased
B003VLBPJA|2|Not a tight fit.  EVERYTIME my backpack which is not more than 5lbs shifts to the right or left creating a major safety hazard for me as a motorcycle rider.  Not at all heavy duty.  After having it for a month I have a total of three hooks left as the others have  fallen off or broken off, all with out my knowledge.  They safety hazard this net brings alone should drop it to one star but because my loads have never completely fallen off (but it may have just been that I notice in time) I give it 2 stars.  I would not recommend buying again.  Very weak, not strong, and does not provide a lot of tension.  When using I double it up with two bungee cords for added insurance.  Looking for one I had previously that was more heavy duty and provided greater tension.  I would not buy this again.  I have been riding for 19 years now and this is tip toeing being a safety hazard.
B001UCEUZI|5|Very satisfied.
B00D3ZLN2I|4|Works as expected keeps wipers off windshield. Easy to spot when going out.
B005CEURS4|5|This sunshield drastically reduces the temperature and fits just right.
B00FGSN7Q0|5|Great product. Super easy install. Saved my new radiator.
B00UY374ES|3|Easy enough install quality consistent with price.
B00QWUBQF0|5|Fit great on my 1997 civic dx coupe
B007CZ2RK2|1|The throttle shaft leaked vacuum and they won't do anything about warranty
B005CLMEHE|5|Great product - easy to install.
B000CPI5ZK|5|added to coolant for protection
B002PNPF1E|3|not exactly accordingly to the original specs but it will do
B00BV0C8TE|5|This stuff really works don't be skeptical try it you'll like it
B00JK327VS|5|The OxGord 4 gauge 500 amp Jumper Cables are a Super Heavy Duty set of cables. If you need a set of Professional Grade of Jumper Cables, you need to purchase a set of these ! The clamps are also really heavy duty. I have purchased probably 20 sets of jumper cables over the years and this is the best set by far. This set will last you the rest of your life. They come in several different lengths, and also come with a carrying case. Most of the other cables I had purchased over the years wouldn't even stay clamped to the battery terminals. These will stay clamped to both the side mount and the top mount batteries. I could talk about these and make it a long review, but I won't. If you are looking for a set of HEAVY DUTY jumper cables that will last a lifetime this is the set you need to buy. I am not try to sound like I am writing a add for OxGord, but I have purchased several items from OxGord and they only carry TOP QUALITY items ! They are really great people to do business with. I am a Amazon reviewer and receive items at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. When I tried to purchase these jumper cables there was a problem with the promo code, it had expired. So I contacted OxGord  they are very courteous, and promptly replied back to me that same day and helped me with the problem. They walked me through the process in a email and everything went smoothly when I placed the order. Two days later I received my Jumper Cables and couldn't have been happier. With that said I Highly Recommend the OxGord 4 Guage 500 amp Jumper Cables to anyone looking for a Professional Grade set of Jumper Cables. I do not allow the discount I receive effect the way I review any item. I am just like everyone else and depend on other peoples honest reviews to decide on whether or not I purchase the item I am interested in.  Special thanks to the OxGord team for being so helpful, and allowing me to review their products. I hope I have addressed any concerns you may have hadabout the quality of this item.
B000CFIPRI|5|Very good item. Quick delivery.
B00JDPZPTY|5|The product fits perfectly and replaced the original easily. It functions as advertised. I am very pleased with this product.
B000B5QFE4|4|Works as described, compliments my rig fine.....Having multiple parts for different model years in the same bag caused some initial confusion and is why it's 4 stars.
B00J5W5HPC|5|Just what I needed and a good price
B0019I33FQ|4|I would have given it 5 stars, but the description says they come pre-gapped for my truck. When received I checked and all where between 042 and 044 while my truck calls out a gap of 032. Not a big deal, just had to press them down a little. Well made and they work. I hope I get 100K out of them.
B007PRPY70|5|Does everything I expected it to
B00NP472P4|5|Works great and good price!
B003WGS0RY|1|Did not stay it fell off the window 2 days after attaching it I even wiped surface with alcohol first and let dry. it also took forever for something so small to be shipped
B007GMHTQ8|5|I love it! It is just the right size and sturdy, and it looks great on my jeep.
B00IS7B0XI|5|Very easy to install, but do watch the video on youtube to see how to get the gauge cluster apart.
B001F15SLE|5|WORKED PERFECTLY
B008720YYA|1|Installed on Friday evening and it solved my problem. Drove truck 72 miles and everything okay. Got up Monday morning to take my daughter to tennis practice and truck died on interstate.  Got out and opened hood, turned key to on position and no pre start injector clatter. $152 tow later and a diagnosis of 0 volts from the FICM.  I did see that some other reviewers had bad parts also. I will try a replacement and see what happens.
B005PZMLDY|2|They Don't fit as well as depicted. ...no cut outs for seat pockets  or backseat arm rest
B00GBBEDKU|4|The front mudguards installed in 5 minutes per wheel and fit perfectly.  The rear mudguards were not made for the European Spec Corolla so I had to cut them and drill new holes and used 3M tape to secure the inside bottom section to avoid drilling extra holes in my rear bumper.  I was able to make them fit nicely in the end and you would not know that they did not originally fit the car.  The modifications and installation of the rear mudguards took about 1 hour.
B00S5ZXC7A|2|Connects when it wants to, disconnects all the time, can't get more then 30 minutes of operation, then it will disconnect from iPhone wifi.Junk
B004IBZS04|1|I bought the mickey from a different seller and this one is not 5L its smaller than mickey.. So dissapointed.
B00BRAVCEK|4|It fits my car. Nough said
B002J7VX4Y|2|new car smell??? Definitely nothing close to new car smell. More like cough syrup/alcohol mixed together smell. I will be returning this misleading product.
B00J7RB72M|5|Good quality!
B00HA1MTYC|5|Happy wife.
B00681BDXI|4|Worked OK and still works OK.
B005NLQAHS|5|I had an Inova scan tool which I loved.  I did a software update and something went wrong. It ended up being locked with no way of re-loading software or doing the update again.  The company said I could send it to them and they'd unlock/update it for me for the sum of $60.  While this is fair, I asked about a replacement. A new one would be $65.  This tool worked flawlessly for 10 years. It owed me nothing and it was a glitch on my end during update.  Still...  I checked into OBDII BT modules which would do the same thing plus have live data.  I saw the reviews on this unit and decided to try it.  I'm so glad I did. Much cheaper and works well.  I'm using it on my 2002 Saturn Vue and my 98 Jeep Wrangler.  I like the Torque app for my Android.  I also like PISTON which is a no frills app.  Both work fine. I've tried a couple other apps that don't work, and there are a couple others I want to try yet. Bottom line is its a good unit for a great price and I would definitely order it again.
B009F4JHHO|1|No software, does not work with Iphone.
B004INRUVC|5|Great torque Wrench
B003BXMAX8|4|The bag got here fast . It was a grate value . Holds enough for my wife and me to ride long distance and stay over night . Grate bag for the money.
B00JJBWMDO|4|Looks like they would work great.  Hope we never have to use them.
B000NCWK8K|3|Good Quality
B0009IQZX4|5|worked great
B007VR9P1K|5|Great stuff
B0093PKOOU|5|a great sturdy quality plate holder.
B000BNZPT2|1|The set screws broke after maybe opening my tailgate 3 times.
B003YJJS2U|5|Holding up to the elements so far. looks good too.
B00QW9DFLO|5|brighter than original
B00CHSXE38|4|Fit perfectly.  Wish it had instructions with it though.
B00J44Y9LE|5|well, it's oil what more can I say.
B00W2XE3O2|5|worked great
B004HE3V9W|5|Great for my 2006 Galant
B0117BD16A|1|Junk junk junk i know wat im doing wont work switch must be bad do not waste ur money switch is wired wrong put old switch back in works fine JUNK JUNK JUNK
B001KSCSQU|4|👍🏻
B00JRCSP3Q|1|I don't recommend this product if your using it outdoors.it's not durable like it should be.mine last only for 3 months and rips like tissue paper.
B00HAXUL0O|5|Light duty but adequate for the purpose
B0057B52ZU|5|I received a different one, I believe TYC but it was great. 5 minutes to replace, should have done it sooner
B00O2N18BQ|5|Ordered another and its still a great product. Shipping was a little faster then before. It also comes with a 20amp fuse. Got this fuse holder to use with a relay for my car stereo remote wire for amplifier. Read my other comment on what i used the other fuse holder for. Thanks
B010MHV00O|5|FINALLY....A cup holder that works for large Neoprene bottles!!!!! No more spills in the car. I can handle it! Also, it sticks up enough to allow a garbage bag to be wrapped around it to help keep our car clean.
B0006Z9SQQ|3|It attracts more dust on the car interior, specially in the navigation screens
B0002NIKHA|5|I am very happy with these mats and they look great in the truck. They fit nicely and look like they will last a very long time. Thanks for a great product.
B00FH43D1C|4|The lens that comes with it is extremely easy to scratch. My first ride a bug scratched it! Other than that pretty good. The top vents only work when your head is turned.
B000CCM3J2|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B0044EAUXU|5|nice and on time thank you
B00M4S5LAK|5|It worked perfect
B0066O21GA|5|These are wonderful tools.  Very well made, unlike some made in Taiwan.
B000CPJMFM|5|It is HUGE, but it fit perfectly using all three screws. On my 4runner, it protrudes out a bit (to about the distance my tires stick out), but I am okay with that.
B004RNJYW6|5|Permanent switch from mobil1 for me. Great Amazon price & my engine seems a little quieter with this brand.
B00PPVWTWQ|5|A+++++++
B00V5RHVYA|4|No one I know has this one. Good times.
B000BQO22U|5|love it
B00X619KJC|2|This has very thin wire. It got hot and started to fail with 35-40 watts running through it. I had to go with something else.
B00FMWCI9W|5|Just fine no issues
B005VWYP2Q|5|I installed this on my '03 Honda Odyssey.  I had an '00 Odyssey and this '03 - all of the door locks seem to go out around 100k miles.  I would rack this up as one of those parts that Honda didn't get right...
B011P108DG|5|Great product! Awesome fit! Real carbon fiber.
B00EQMNVKY|5|Everything fit and worked as designed, thanks!
B00H3UHYAY|5|As described, it was a replacement relay on my Suzuki outboard, no complaints.
B007V2DJLM|5|The best
B00RW7WMX2|5|Work well, these were my first ever replacements for my windshield wipers and I was too foolish to look at the directions on the box, as a result I put them in wrong and thought they were garbage.  Moral of the story, don't be a fool like me and read the box and put them in right and they'll work great.
B00A30W2OO|4|Seems to be just as good as the original. Very good price.
B008KWP84I|5|good...
B00DSPEFZ0|4|Shipping: The prime was was great and punctual as usual. Packaging was rather redundant, with the product being encapsulated in aseveral layers of cardboard boxes.<br /><br />Product: The actual rack is great. Sturdy as a tank, and straightforward to install with a drill and dremel tool. The only gripe I may have is the installation of a top box rack on top of this, but that is no fault of this actual product. Will probably have to rig the box on with a couple of washers/rods.<br /><br />Installation: This can be installed with a 3/4&#34; drill bit no problem; in fact I would almost recommend it. This is because since you are drilling at an angle for most of the holes, it is hard to gauge their centers when drilling. A 3/4&#34; bit is pretty forgiving, and any excess can be removed using a dremel tool or cylinder file. It bolts in very sturdy, straight to the frame; the 6 lb load limit seems a bit modest to me but I could be wrong.
B00INVEUP4|5|Thanks
B00063X38M|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B00J2CHYZQ|1|my cell phone flash has more light out put than these, not to mention they are 10k (very deep blue) , sent emails for refund with no support. DONT BUY.
B00Y1PZAIW|4|After 100 miles they are still tight. priced decent. installed well.  Will update if they fail.
B00EKTJIBY|5|Work great.
B0031I4HNE|1|Amazon needs to get their fitment s*** straight! First the wrong brake pads and now the wrong rotors I'm pissed!
B001C6L5CS|5|So far so good seems like a quality part installed without issues on 06 X5.
B00FDQPCR2|5|So far so good, soft warm light.
B008J4HOXU|5|Love it
B005ZWM0R4|5|This is just pretty cool.  I always wanted an OBD for my cars and finally had the opportunity when my daughter's 09 Highlander started throwing check engine light.  Installed software on my laptop, put in supplied software key to register the software and plugged it into the car.  Very obvious how to clear the light, shows all kinds of interesting information.<br /><br />As a point of reference, Toyota dealership charged $119 to read and clear the light after we decided not to have the work done (small EVAP leak). I could have gotten 4 of these for that!  I was on vacation so wasn't thinking straight...never again.
B003UC0OKQ|2|The Fenders themselves are a nice product/design.  The problem comes when you go to install them.  I understand drilling new holes is required for this product so that is not the complaint.  The bolts, nuts, spacers they provide to attach the fenders will only work for half of the holes provided.  To attach them you have to be able to screw the nut on the back side of the bolt, but 3 out of the 6 there is now way to reach.  I will now have to go down and find sheet metal screws for every attach point, so that all the screws match.  I have a 1990 yj and would recommend going with a different product.
B009E9KKUS|4|JUST WHAT I EXPECTED..THANKS FOR EVERYTHING !!
B000RXNLK6|5|This is a great Quick Detailer product.  Meguiars has three or four different quick detailers and this is their second best  in their line.  I use it to help remove wax and also for quick cleanups of my paint.  You can use it on any part of your car both inside and outside.  It even works on glass.
B000C5I6YA|5|Great product.100% easy on no hassle intallaton
B00EDOPBDU|5|Very bright and uniform illumination without heat.
B00HPTLL0M|5|Good fit for Honda VTX1300retro 2007. Gas mileage has improved
B0006H8BDU|5|Fit perfectly, great service
B000VKRQH4|5|Works great, easy to install in a 2005 Saturn Vue V6 AWD.
B00PZQHUF2|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B0039001TI|5|Good delivery, competitive price.
B004GCO28E|5|Awesome. Perfect fit
B00VQTLGMK|5|I placed this on my 2015 Lexus IS350 and everybody in the office was so surprised to see my car with it. They find it very appealing, though they admitted it was very rare that they see it like that. I have to admit that it is not as sturdy as I expected, the license plate has the tendency to rotate since it's only supported at one side but overall I am satisfied with this purchase. I purchased this to avoid drilling holes through the grill of the car.
B00B0WJYN6|5|Very happy with it
B000JWKE3C|4|Easy Install and well made product, The paint is really thin and starts to rust quickly
B000EBKG5E|5|Very good product for the dollar.
B0002KKIQO|3|I had bought this by accident I was meaning to buy the protectant but I has been happy with their product so I tried it ...I saw no great difference over how I was cleaning it over all other then adding another step to it ...so really at day's end I wouldn't buy it nor recommend it
B002YK9YDS|5|Perfect fit
B00UU1DPRY|5|So far so good.  Finds satellite fast and it is much quieter and somewhat smaller than the VueCube that I let go with an RV I sold.
B004C0WF66|5|Great quality,well built.
B00EECLL9O|5|We have a 2004 Sienna and when the one headlight went out I went to the auto parts store and bought some halogen bulbs. So I was very surprised when I went to change them and the bulbs were completely different. I headed back to the auto parts store and returned the halogen bulbs and check the pricing on HID replacements and they wanted a $99 a bulb. Did a quick search on Amazon and found these with so many great reviews and I thought it was to goo to be true. I ordered them while at the store and had them the next day. The HIDs easily swapped out and just make sure to take your time. The light seems a bit brighter and look great!
B00KX0SDBA|2|The set was missing the all the pieces.. The front and rear emblems were not included.
B001G6BDQW|5|Just what I needed
B001LU0ZB2|1|I don't understand, when I bought this it claimed to fit my vehicle, Finally got around to installing it and it does not function correctly, come back here to check other reviews and now it says it does not fit my vehicle WTF!
B00HBHMDUA|5|Does exactly what it says!  Used on my '99 EG Classic with 88 to 95 upgraded motor to eliminate detonation (marbles in the motor) at mid-range RPM's.  Word to the wise though, just buy the USB interface to go with it.  I didn't and I had to wait an extra week because yes, if you want to do it right...you need it.
B00C33EZ1W|5|Bad ass
B00EPLI7ZK|5|Good reading LED. Pricey, but works well.
B002SRVX9U|5|Gives the countertop a real shine while removing fine dust
B00F8M32JQ|5|Great bumper sticker - quickly shipped ! !
B0012S9A5U|5|Got the job done with ease.
B000JFHNEC|5|these adapters work nicely on my car with my dads AC gauges/Freon he normally uses for Commercial restaurant AC systems. Love the quick release/insert feature.
B00T5G53ZM|5|It's working great for me (note 3)
B000HRWXWE|5|Good product!
B000FW2MC2|5|Although these are semi large, they work perfect for us. We use two in the bedroom, one on each night stand.  Works well for water glass or morning coffee.  Works like a coaster to keep condensation off the wood, but great to keep from spilling your drink!!<br /><br />I actually ordered another for my office desk for the same reason, to make it mush less likely to spill!<br /><br />Thinking about putting a &#34;Glow in the Dark&#34; coaster in the bottom to make it easier to see at night.
B00MBPSXEM|1|This mirror is NOT a power unit, as described. It's a HEATED mirror. DIsappointed to receive it and find it was incorrectly described.
B009XIUHRQ|4|Fits perfect, looks and feels good.
B002VVHRSE|5|Works great with the Condor chock for our Motorcycles
B00DSO938A|5|Love it. It's soft and good quality. Went on easy.
B000C9MU7U|5|Works fine
B002X6VXL4|4|The Stanley J5C09 has aided me quite a few times since I purchased it ~ 6 months ago: jumped my car battery at least twice, and aired-up slow-leaking tires on at least 5 occasions. Holds a charge really good, and withstands being in a car's back hatch area in the scorching Texas summer.<br /><br />Only downside is that like any other portable air compressor, it tends to move around a bit when the compressor is running (due to the extreme vibrations). Not enough to pop it off a valve stem, but if you're using the built-in light at the time, you'll find that it ain't illuminating what it had been.
B0006MTRJ2|5|I just needed a short hose and it works great!  Thanks!
B000C5E996|2|Bought this on July 7th to replace the original thermostat in my 2005 saab 9-3. It is now Aug 30th and it has started sticking shut. I can't believe it lasted less than 2 months, and less than 1000 miles of driving. Thankfully the car is not overheating completely, it is just consistently running at a much higher than usual temperature (it is about halfway between normal and hot on the gauge). All coolant was completely flushed out and replaced when the thermostat was changed. It seemed to be working fine until now. This is unfortunate because i was previously satisfied.
B001TANEOO|1|Bought these in April 2014, died in July 2015. Tough to replace and buy these each year, definitely not worth the headache.
B00HTOB0NG|5|Bought these to replace my DDM Tuning HID Error kit that blew up. Got Prime shipping and didn't have to wait 8 weeks. I would highly recommend these to anyone coming here to look for replacement Error kits.
B010SC3ODY|5|The item fits perfectly, very easy to install, will give your car instant upgrade.
B008BLKI2U|1|This was a waste of money did not go on smooth at all !!! I used water , heat & force !!! And it came out horrible maybe it was just me but I'm very disappointment 😔 Only thing good about this was it came in the mail 2 weeks before delivery date
B00JJBWMDO|3|I wish I had looked more closely at the item specifications, the hammer is VERY light, and I worry it might not have enough inertia behind it in an emergency.<br />If you've got big hands, get a bigger hammer than these, the hammer barely reaches beyond my knuckles.
B00B32DISA|5|These work great to keep you truck level.  I also purchased the daystar air bag cradle to use with these so my suspension can articulate off road when i am not hauling a load.
B0106NR1GQ|5|Greatly improved the road wander. Fit was perfect
B00HN8BG6E|5|As it show on photo.
B0087WCI44|5|This was about $10 less than any local auto store.  Fit perfectly on my Chevy Venture, Great part.
B008X02JLC|5|There awesome. I had them put in a 98 ford escort. And it's a nice smooth ride. Top notch quality for cheep price.
B00P9QKPEG|5|Very Pleased
B00B8T1150|1|Size doesn't cover the whole windshield from the sides and top or bottom
B00Q2QGB0Y|3|This is a good looking switch, and it does what it says - turns a light on and off, but the quality left something to be desired. The pins in the back came out when I removed the connectors after testing, before permanent install. I'm hoping they stay in and don't come loose. If the pins were held in more firmly by whichever means, I wiuld have given 5 stars. It does look and feel good.
B001B4UW2K|3|This is my forth AVS Ventvisor and I've been extremely happy with the previous three. This one however fits perfectly but does not allow you to roll your window down an adequate amount. If you install them so that it covers the painted area around the window then you can open your window maybe a quarter of an inch, so the trick is to install them as low as you can so that the adhesive tape is following the bottom part of the window frame while making sure the gap on the painted area on top is somewhat equal. After doing that it will allow you to open your window around a half an inch and in my opinion is not adequate but better than nothing.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Exactly what we needed!
B01184PGLY|3|Great deal but the upper back corner couldnt go flush to the body
B000AD0VQA|5|Quick shipping, easy to install, works great!
B002N5T3J4|5|Works great
B00JH2GMMC|5|Perfect part for my repair needs.
B001V8LQ2G|3|Ok
B000C5G390|5|Great
B00GV14TQS|3|Bad paint. Peeling off when arrived due to the back  packaging. Need to care more for the consumer. Other than that they are great
B005FN4UE4|1|Poorly made and didn't fit my vehicle even though description said they would.
B003TQ4AO4|5|it pre filters oh my
B008N9WGLG|5|Solid item as advertised
B004ZF3DYG|3|Does not work for 2014 ford fusion without buying better ballasts.
B00G620ZVU|5|Awesome zombie bright ! They are awesome looking and appear to be made really well. They were very easy to mount and aim. They came in a bomb proof package and were pristine.
B00CC12NOG|5|Wanted something like these, but cost more for the popular brand.  Tried them out and need I say they are strong, and of high material.  Have them only a short time, but very pleased thus far
B00GYTEBUQ|5|Fit  properly
B00XZ9MYRA|5|Works just like the original one
B00CCYWNUM|4|Keeps Odor down and tank flushes clean.
B00JFJLDJY|5|Excellent
B003YKXTSI|3|It's a nice key chain and sturdy but that comes at the cost of lightness, very heavy for your pocket and that's not counting the keys!
B000C55MWE|5|Husband says good fit for a 2001 Nissan Altima GLE.
B00JJBNGZ2|3|not as thick as original
B00BXOO9JU|5|Great item, well painted and a good color match to vehicle that is 14 years old. Quality excellent, quick ship and received within 1 week of order A+++
B00G8XN5LO|1|Bought this part for my ford explorer, I installed it two weeks ago, and it is already leaking, So I have to buy another one and install it again..... do not purchase this part!!!
B00Q4KYSGW|5|Love this spoiler. Compliments the car perfectly. Perfect color match!
B003D2BXQC|4|Best fitting for my RHS heads on Boss 302 block
B0023VIRDG|5|Very easy to install works great.  Best price
B00GRHS8Y0|5|Great product, fit just like it was suppose to and looks great
B00OKS0YS6|5|very nice quality
B00008RW9U|5|The original...  and the best !
B00GFTV4DC|5|It's oil.
B0036ULEV0|4|The Included air fitting was to short and needed to be swapped.
B00D3OQ49Q|5|easy install, better then OEM hooks
B00CC2ZUHM|1|I installed this product in my 2011 kia optima and it started causing problems in my car. The alternator went out and the car isnt charging as it is suppose to be. Ive already spent a couple hundred dollars replacing misc. parts and still havent gotten to the bottom of this. As soon as i unplug the HIDS the car starts working again. The lights look and run great but pull too much power from the battery.
B004A2GOK4|5|Fits perfectly as you would expect a motorcraft part to fit. Replacing it couldn't have been easier; don't forget to clear out any debris (leaves, bugs, dirt, etc.) after you remove th old filter before you install the new one.
B000COTT1U|5|I bought these to combat the Squishy rear end in the my 2007 Mercury Grand Marquis. I need to be able to haul 4 people, a whole trunk full, and tow a 14 ft alumacraft. So far, I've only tested out a full trunk load and it drives great. Put about 600lbs back there and it handles it no problem. I teamed these with Police Interceptor rear shocks.
B0006H938M|5|Worked out just fine
B001FE3Z4I|5|Exactly what I needed, great quality and great pricing. The package shipped reasonable fast as well. Thank you very much for a reliable service!
B00NORK0G0|4|nice sticker
B0009IQZH0|4|They are okay, great price, but not as absorbent as I had hoped.  Next time I will buy the real deal instead of an artificial material.
B000CPI6AY|5|Everything OK
B000IYFRHO|4|Works good for price
B00P006TWS|5|Great product, works just like it was suppose to and looks great
B000FQ7OM6|4|Works as advertised.
B00FN1ZGT6|4|good
B00AZPP0Y6|4|Item arrived as usual in quick time as I have amazon prime. Product was well packaged. Came with all hardware to mount unit. Only thing I would recommend is open the side caps and seal with silicone (rtv). I do this with any cheap led light. I compared these to the 2 cube lights bi Nilight. The light bar is bright but it's a dull white compared to the 2 cubes which have a much brighter white circle. The light bar throws the light but it is a faded light compared to the cubes. If the bar was as bright as the Cubes but in a single beam then I'd definitely buy again. For right now I'll stick with the cubes. As for my uses I use them on my 4 wheelers and farm tractors. I've had the cubes on 2 4 wheelers for 8 months. The 4 wheelers sit outside and aren't covered. No problems with the lights fogging. I will have to try this bar on my utility 4 wheeler and see if it holds up.
B004QV4NG6|5|Great
B00EQ57BE8|5|Very handy!  Connected to my smartphone easily.
B00H90NL4G|3|These shackles add a finishing touch to any aftermarket front and rear bumper. My only complaint is the paint chips very easily. They aren't meant to be used it seems only looked upon unless you want to repaint them every time you hook up to them.
B000KL581A|5|Just a great product. You can tell that there was a great deal of research and time that went into the final product.<br />Underpriced for what it is worth!!great experience, can't wait for next year!!!
B000HTAH70|5|Great center punch for the money, next step up would be a Starett, but you can buy 3 of these for one of those.<br /><br />Works great on Aluminum and Brass, has a hard time with stainless and works fine on mild steel.
B003G0O1M4|5|Fits our 2013 Honda Pilot perfectly. Great quality.
B005CLL4WK|3|Easy install. Need to be made with better materials, so they don't break so easy
B002GZD8JM|5|Husband loves this
B00KWMNI6Y|3|Huge and thick but worth it
B00CXYVKKA|5|This sticker is very useful to me. It weeds out the idiots and the easily offended. I know if the mom behind me in the pick up line at school laughs at my sticker, she's going to be my friend. Thanks, Slap-Art!
B0034NKDKC|5|Good qualities and a great seller.
B0066RKX44|5|Fits nicely in my rear console.
B00E16M1S8|5|2010 Prius, perfect fit
B00QN2SZQK|5|Just what I needed
B00JBIRGBI|1|Had for a Couple days now and already lost my right hand light...and to top it off it blew my fuses
B001PP4TY2|4|Works as described...just as an FYI - 15 Dodge/Chrysler/Jeep owners needs to have their PCMs unlocked or buy an additional PCM that's already unlocked.
B00IKMWQMK|5|My husband installed 2 of these in our travel trailer. They do a much better job that the original. Great at pulling fresh cool air through!
B002SIR91A|3|It's really small.
B00R5GL9W0|5|fit perfect and easy to install.  we have a fleet of these problem child Chevys.
B000WG952Q|5|Compact and powerful
B00KHUQ9NK|1|My wife tried this for her Prius and it didn't fit very well and had a very strong odor, like the chemicals in rubber or plastic. The company was very good about taking it back though.
B00BPHV18C|5|An exact copy of the original. Should be good for many years.
B0017OAL7U|5|Easy to install for the rear break lights of a 2005 Saturn Vue.
B00DHQCWXM|5|Fit perfectly & exactly what was needed
B001EMTQMQ|5|Very straight forward and easy to install. The rug fit the tail like a glove. I noticed after a few weeks of heat it is starting to buckle a little but nothing to worry about thus far. I would buy this again as it is easy to install and looks nice.
B0000AXRH1|5|Use it for pouring bleach.
B0054WI7CW|5|This a must have tool. Keep your hands free from oil good tool.
B0049U3LB2|5|works great
B00NF1UPII|5|Very satisfied
B000AUMM1A|5|Easy installation on my '11 Acura TSX.  I really like the look of the yellow for my daytime running lights.  They also look great and perhaps show a little more detail when using the high beams at night.  Would recommend.
B002LF7CI0|4|I really do like this item but my one issue with it is it's a little off color that the rest of the chrome trim on my f150. It's not fully noticeable until you get up close.
B00JT4HB14|5|They were great
B009LZUJRY|5|This was exactly what it was advertised to be. The quality is great and it's been working fine.  What a deal!
B00MB0DO8W|5|While it was a bit of a struggle to get this steering wheel cover on, it looks absolutely amazing now that it's on securely. The trick with this cover is to completely cover the top half of the wheel and work your way around little by little, and to stretch it as much as you can to fit securely. It helps if you grab it from the back of the wheel. A little bit of elbow grease gets it there! The three green ovals on the cover are slightly padded, so it makes turning the wheel really easy! Well worth the money and makes my car look great.
B004ZF4MW8|5|Great!
B0006303PS|5|Very good product they look awesome
B007GOT6FS|5|Përfek
B008D8OQ5G|5|Fits as expected, light and comfy.  Added a bubble shield for full coverage.  Has made riding way more comfortable.
B001TCWL1E|5|excellent low current meter ... help me find a 200 milliamp constant drain on my car battery...
B00REJXVEW|5|It is really convenient putting on and off
B0012PZ02K|5|Excellent product and performance.
B00GHTE2IO|5|bought this to replace the defective one in my 2007 Chevy Colorado. The #3 fan speed pin was burned out. Installation was simple, It would be somewhat nice if the cables were color coded like the stock plug. But not a big deal at all. I suggest getting some shrink tube and a heat gun to make the crimping more pretty.
B00GUVG6TC|5|Nice added touch since I already have a chrome snake from my Shelby
B000F0Z1L8|2|The DashMat fits moderately well
B005A8MNFC|5|Easy to<br />Put on and holds a can or bottle of water. Great buy
B00LDR8T2K|5|Love these lights
B002PN53DO|5|Still stopping strong after a couple thousand miles of usage. Has a really consistent bite and brakes quietly!
B000EPP6X2|5|Good
B004ZF39T0|5|Kensun makes great HIDs. They included slim ballasts for my kits every time. Solid quality electronics, nice bright even colored lights.
B0030DISUI|5|Perfect
B0002X2MZQ|4|Nice fit. Worked great
B000AMBOI0|5|This tester is a must have for any shade tree mechanic.  It is a well made, solid piece of equipment that accurately measures not only the battery voltage but also the amp draw for the system under load. The large clips for the battery terminals grip well providing a good connection.
B0006H933M|4|worked well
B00FZJXVC0|5|So far so good. Easy install, and much better quality than the cheap LEDs you get for $50 and less.  Don't waste your time buying the cheap ones. I spent hours installing the cheap ones only to find they flicker.  Comes with relay, and all needed morning equipment.
B000COOBM2|4|great price
B00WSB8DX0|1|Came fast, but is not for an iPad, had to cut it to fit my iPad and still did not fit correctly.
B00FN2K1UY|5|Very thick mats.  Love them!  Fit my 2015 Kia Soul perfectly.  No cutting needed.
B0009H51R6|5|Fit my 1998 2.7 liter Tacoma. Now I'm chirpin gears and pulling Brodies. The engine sounds like a vortex of wind now. I am kidding. It fits. It filters air. Buy it, or don't. I don't care.
B007TZ45CS|5|Just what I wanted.  Came fast
B00VK0ATNC|5|just as expected
B00PRZCXAS|5|This spoiler really makes the car look so nice. Perfect color match. LOVE IT
B00EQD7V4U|5|Looks great on my Honda! Go Phins!
B00BHMRTF4|1|When I typed in the shield I needed for my Scorpion helmet this particular one kept coming up so I assumed it would fit.  It did not and I had to return it.
B00KVQV80Y|1|Looked cool until the entire switch melted while in use.
B004BYX8W8|5|Got my Jeep up and running in no time. It did come in pieces, but the paper along with it, showed how to put it back together. Hopefully it lasts for even longer then the factory one did. I ill update my review if I notice anything else about it. Right now, it saved me a lot of time and money.
B00KTHYA1O|5|I received this  very quick I set it up myself working fine thank you very much
B005N6WC16|1|Too small
B009JTCLDW|5|Fast delivery.. exactly what was needed.. would definitely use again
B007QI9DIO|5|Great for what I need it for
B00D9BFR8M|5|Fits my 2002 Yamaha Roadstar Warrior 1700CC perfectly.
B000CKBLW4|5|Had to get my rotors resurfaced on my 97 Honda Civic because they were warped, so I took the opportunity to replace my pads when I had the wheels off. These pads, with my resurfaced rotors, have completely eliminated the pulsing I was having while braking, and I feel my braking performance is very good, and no noise that I can tell. I would buy these again, even though I'm not sure how they'll hold up over time, but for the price they're good.
B006H34BUY|5|easy to use and store. does the job.
B000CMHNY2|4|Ideal, although the base is a bit wide which made placement a bit of a challenge.
B00VWGF1W8|3|It's messes with the knife and sprint button just have to push harder
B000P79C2U|5|Works very well.
B00PRB4NIW|5|Love it
B00OOXQZB2|5|Easy install and look great
B00CQH6J64|5|Exellent
B004WWYRL0|5|work well
B000ZINYIW|4|This is nice for my carry on luggage. Good quality.
B004J00GII|2|Magnets are junk and pouches won't stay closed. Mailing mine back today!
B005MZYKWW|5|Very pretty for my themed car. Thank you.
B0049MTFWE|5|Searched for and followed instructions  video. Plugged right in, works great.
B000IG3QUM|1|Two buttons below for setting this clock.  The mode button on the left does not work.  Worthless clock.  Cheap and worthless.  Now what?  Pay to ship it back?  It's c_ _ p.  Customers, we know better:  You get what you pay for.
B000TBCRH4|5|good quality item very heavy duty
B00FS66N20|5|Was exactly as advertised. Perfect!
B009V04J8Y|1|I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO PROGRAM THIS MYSELF WITH THE DIRECTIONS THAT WERE TO BE INCLUDED.  THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.
B001CAB8B2|5|Perfect fit and easy installation for 2004 Mustang GT.
B00ODCYL42|5|Great value for the price. I'm using this product to restore a 1960 Mercedes Benz . The degrease works great. The prep is awesome .  Make sure you use the correct personal protective gear when working over head. The POR -15 great coating . Yes you do need to follow the instructions and apply two coats as prescribed. The finished project looks better than it did from the factory.
B005MZYLN0|5|Very pretty for my themed car. Thank you.
B0039O2OAI|5|Works great on all applications from motorcycles to lawn mowers.
B006TOIO6I|5|Its exactly what I wanted.  Perfect for my new F150!
B001LHVOVK|5|plugs in great, generates accurate codes to diagnose car troubles. you'll be the most popular guy in the office if you keep this in your car. &#34;Hey, can I borrow your scanner?&#34; You'll hear that all the time. It's wonderful
B00EHIPOY8|5|great product! easy install
B005HR1K46|5|high quality
B000COBCF6|5|Perfect
B00KDRDWLE|4|Had a few issues with fit. Tuning Pros took care of it right away. They were very easy to work with. Will order from them again.
B00LI99V3O|1|Would not recommend ordering from this company. My order showed up two weeks late, as well as torn. I was not even able to use it. Very disappointed!
B0028JLO3I|3|vibrates quite a bit...put felt padding behind it...which helps...and i.m trying to get used to the (lesser with padding) vibration...but we'll see...
B004RHA7S2|5|Exact fit!  Easy install.  Jeep Grand Cherokee 2002, HO v8 engine.
B0013AG61S|5|Great product!
B004RS8XFA|5|Ordered this for my husbands Honda Ridgeline, loves it
B006KEV2HU|1|I bought the EMP Stewart 4 years ago as preventive maintenance to my 2003 BMW Z4: it has the apparent reputation of being the bee's knees, the ant's pants, and the cat's pajamas of water pumps. I paid full access price for the rodeo...<br /><br />It replaced a perfectly working 80K miles and 8 year old original BMW water pump which was supposed to be a ticking time bomb...<br /><br />Well... After 4 years and 60K miles it is leaking.<br /><br />I've decided to replace it with this one [[ASIN:B00DJ3N3SQ FMI 20669 Premium Performance New Water Pump]] and will send it back to the manufacturer to get a replacement (since they won't issue refunds) and probably resell it.<br /><br />I'll update this review to let you know if the warranty is at least any good.
B00192QBPQ|4|It is what it says it was.
B000EBMK8A|1|This seat is flimsy and hard to install. It adds very little comfort. I would not recommend it if you need back support.
B00G9SB45M|5|Great Lights, reaches to the end of my 20 foot trailer.
B00FXXWWM8|5|This products works the way I needed too thanks
B007N76NXQ|5|fits on the front of my stock FJ80
B004LPAP2I|5|Great stuff
B0009V4GD2|5|Just installed a second LeBra on my RAV4 1999.  The RAV has been cared for and has over 234,000 miles on it.  I have<br />purchased the LeBra for other cars I've owned.  It's like buying a Toyota, no need to try another brand when you have the history<br />of a proven product.  As always, Amazon came through!
B0073W7ZLA|5|I ordered my antenna on Saturday and received it on Sunday morning. I don't really listen to the radio so the reception complaints in the reviews I read were the least of my worries. I still get the same reception as I did before (I think it depends on the area you live in). Upon opening my package I was surprised how small the antenna was. I'm so happy I purchased it! It's perfect! My jeep looks so much better now. Someone needs to give jeep the memo that those huge antennas are OUT! It's 2015 lol
B011VO1HTQ|1|Fell apart instantly. Wayyyyyyyyyyy smaller then shown. Mine barely fit on wrist
B000BQWNRQ|2|This brush is well made, and a good length, has a poor overall design. The scraper is at a different angle than the brush, which puts it at an awkward angle when trying to use the brush head as a handle for scraping.
B00KJWW7GO|5|This is a great replacement cup holder for MK4 cars.
B000FPYHOU|1|Loses about 10 minutes a month, need I say more.
B00NJ008MI|5|Perfect fit.
B00NM1XL0K|1|Great prices but the reverse lights don't fit my 2015 Chevy Silverado 1500, and on the product discripion states that it does.
B001LQL5UG|5|product worked great and had a fast delivery
B00167R1SA|5|awesome pice
B00I7EKM54|5|Fit great in my 2012 Outback.  So much less expensive than through dealer...
B001MU28F2|5|Just right on my 2011 Mazda6.
B001N0IROM|5|Arrived quickly and matches original.
B0002NILQU|5|very good and fast shipping
B000VU2174|5|This worked out great in our 2003 Pontiac Vibe.
B00192JF9U|3|wrong one for my furnace
B00UCE4SK2|4|Nice radiator. Has kept my jeep running cool and no leaks from it. Fits almost perfect. if you use your original bolts to tighten a/c condenser be careful not to over-tighten them, they could go into the black side tanks. Have been driving jeep with it in for 3 months with no problems.
B00IM9AQJG|4|I want to like this helmet. I really do. But it's got a serious design flaw. If you do not have a windshield, this helmet will try to fly off your head at highway speed!  I've been riding motorcycles for over 30 years. I've had many helmets. My favorite brand is HJC. Not only do they make helmets with the inside shape that best fits my particular head, their quality is very good and the price is unbeatable. I will spend however much it takes to get the best, and I've ended up purchasing HJC helmets more times than not in the past.  This helmet looks great. It fits great. The retractable visor is a nice feature, but it's too clear to use in the sun and doesn't have the coverage to give any kind of wind protection. I have an HJC full-face helmet with a retractable sun visor that works much better than this one. But the visor is a minor point here. The big issue with this helmet is that it is simply not made to be worn in highway speed wind. I've adjusted this helmet every which way. And the only way I can keep it from lifting off my head or being ripped backward is to crank the retention strap down around my neck to the point of being uncomfortable.  Does this mean you shouldn't buy this helmet? No. There are at least three ways that it'll work fine for you.  1. You only ride around town and don't get up to high speed very often or at all; 2. You have a windshield, fairing or other wind-deflecting device on your bike for use at highway speeds; 3. You ride on the highway and don't have a fairing, but really like to tighten your helmet to the point of pain; 4. Any combination of 1, 2 & 3.  All kidding aside, this is a great-looking, well-built helmet at a reasonable price. But it's the first one from HJC that I've owned that I've found with any problem at all. And one of the two design problems with this helmet is pretty substantial. But if you fall into one of the 4 categories listed above, I would highly recommend this helmet. So 3 stars is fair.  ***EDIT: Having hadthe chance to wear this helmet with a motorcycle with a windshield and others with a fairing, I added another star. Like every other HJC helmet I've had (5 or 6), this one is excellent. It's lightweight, well-constructed & comfortable. I would give it 5 stars if it was this good under any conditions. But if you've got a Road King or any Harley w/o a windshield or fairing or a naked sportbike with nothing to break up the wind, then this helmet will try to climb off your head past about 57 mph. With my bikes that have a windshield, though, this is my go-to helmet. Highly recommend, as long as you either have a windshield or just tool around town.
B000CIZZMI|5|LOOKS GREAT,EASY INSTALLATION
B00MMC934I|5|This is beautiful in my car! fits normal and large size ezpass
B00H36XX6C|4|This battery pack is pretty handy.  It seems odd to me to bundle both a flashlight and a recharging batter pack into the same device, but after using it for a while it is quite handy.<br /><br />First off, the flashlight is very powerful and runs for a long long time.  It's an LED light, so it has the typical blue tint that LED lights do. But it is so bright it will light up an entire large room by itself.  Also, unlike a typical flashlight, it has no dark zone in the middle.  The light is equally balanced throughout the entire beam, so it makes seeing in the dark very easy.  It's also makes for a great impromptu lamp, as it can stand on its end and shine the light straight up.  It also has 3 levels of brightness and an emergency flashing mode.<br /><br />As for the recharging features of the battery pack, they don't seem to live up to the claims of the manufacturer, but it's still pretty solid and will definitely extend a cell phone for quite a while.  I charged my iPhone 6+ from 10% to 95% before the battery pack died.  I got a full charge and an additional 35% charge from a iPhone 5.  I tried this with my iPad air and only restored battery from 19% to 38%, but that's still a decent boost of battery.  So overall it can definitely help when there is no battery around.  I also like that the recharge is a USB port, so you can recharge any device without being limited to the type as long as you have the charging cable for the device you want to charge.<br /><br />The rubber grip and rugged build of this product is a nice feature.  The charging and recharge ports are protected by a rubber flap that securely closes to keep dust and moisture out.  Overall a very solid product that will probably be used more as an excellent flashlight in my house than a recharging battery pack, but when need arises it will be handy to have this as a backup if power goes out and a phone needs charged.
B0076PK6ME|5|Easy to install, factory looking fit. Highly recommend, all you need is 4 screws and 4 washers
B007262DAK|5|This is exactly what I needed to get my small engine running again.
B000A0EJD4|1|Item does not fit 2007 Acura TL

B00DPNBXHI|5|it is an awesome product as described...on my first application and showed very promising result!<br />shipped and delivered prompytly
B0002L6N08|5|So-far, this item is just as described by the seller. It fit my truck just as snugg as you would expect. Seems to do the job it's intended for also. Stays a lot cooler inside when installed. Also helps greatly o not letting the sun harm any of the dash material.
B00GIZZGLO|5|Second one I bought.
B000B66UUW|5|Part was as described and received very quickly.
B000E7YP7I|5|excellent!

B005CHT4W6|5|Doesn't shear down as quick as other oils! Increased my compression as well
B005JU5UMO|1|Not very pleased with these . Very streaky since day one .
B000C2QOAG|5|Fit perfectly on a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country Limited.  It came with the o-rings.  You have to remove the windshield wipers and cowling to reach this as it is right against the &#34;firewall.&#34;  Works great though.  Replace it along with the dryer and compressor.
B005KDO9UY|5|really bright and white. great item! my car uses it as daytime running lights and high beam, its a bit yellow when on daytime running lights because of the lower power.
B00E94KGBG|4|Good product.
B0085C2WNS|2|1. The mirrors I received are not carbon wrapped. I am a little upset that they aren't but I really don't mind that they are solid black. 2. The mirror stems are metal which is nice and the mirrors are plastic which I don't mind. 3. They are really stiff at first to move but they loosens up. 4. They are decent mirrors well priced just wished they were carbon wrapped like they advertised. Would give 4-5 stars if they were carbon wrapped.
B0056OL5LI|5|My Honda CRF250L looks great with this Decal, high quality and super easy to apply
B001REZ6OI|5|An excellent product -- so good that I bought a case of it for use on my collection cars and around the house.
B00GOFRS9G|4|loved it, just wish a bit bigger :)
B00DI3DV6G|4|Works like it should.  I little flimsy
B009AQS5H0|5|Nice item
B002X5H1YS|5|My husband thinks they are very useful
B000CEO7T4|5|Works great and good price!
B001LHVOVK|3|good little bit hard to under Stan
B004Q3OEV8|5|love love love
B000QX0E02|5|These were nice lights<br />Fittment alittle off.<br />Had to add a piece of wheather strip behind light against the fender to take up the space.
B00390RKVA|5|Great Piece of Gear For Your Jeep...!
B00ADS67QU|3|Driver side doesn't quite fit right.  Does not sit flush into mirror assembly.  Passenger-side fits good.  Too late to send back.
B00GBG3FX6|5|Everything went smoothly
B00S0LSXQO|5|Perfect
B000CN5GM2|4|good product
B00JF8YCCK|5|Installed in about 10 minutes and fit perfectly.  I hope to get many years service from these!
B002WSNFVE|5|fit great.
B0060A7VO2|5|worked perfectly, been on car for couple months now
B00480J4I2|5|Excellent 
B004UARNHO|5|Great product to secure your factory or aftermarket wheels.
B00FR2JF0W|5|Works as advertised, capable of charging my iPhone and powering my GPS.  For my application on a 2003 R6 I utilized the double sided tape method and mounted the unit on the lower facial behind the instrument cluster
B000JZZ8EO|5|Perfect replacement for my CTS-V...holding up so far.
B00K31M554|4|It works.
B00DMOSGH0|5|Fast shipping and exactly what I needed..<br />Thanks
B00EKEGRVS|1|Piece of crap
B000BYZA96|5|Too big....ordered wrong one but used it anyway
B003U1M4UA|5|Sweet! I popped it on the truck tailgate with no problem and smile every time I see it. Great item and I am very happy I bought it. As a side note for FYI,  I have a Silver 2004 Ram 1500 SLT and it looks terrific.
B002N32WTY|5|All good as described
B00556MOUS|5|At first it didn't work because i took it to the dealer but once I tryed it myself it worked perfect!
B0009VIQ1A|5|Great for the casual dusting, between car washes.  I use it on my racecar that I run in the Mojave desert & Bonneville to maintain to get the elements off between runs.
B00J00X3NW|5|Have used Mobile-1 regularly and have 215K (and counting) on my car...
B000P0ZJQA|5|a+
B00239WHLG|5|Worked perfectly for a 2002 Toyota Tacoma 3.4 L V6 oil change while using on a Toyota Genuine Parts YZZD1 oil filter. This tool is light weight aluminum, used a 3/8&#34; drive and torqued the filter down good, tool was tight but wiggled off. Many other filter wrench tools would not work, this one did so I highly recommend this tool for DIY oil changers.
B00A14QREI|5|2006 F150 FX4<br />Works perfect, tells correct temp outside<br />easy install too, maybe 2 mins.
B00BDQK3SY|5|Nice looking cover on my 22ft
B0046IC24O|5|Very fast shipping and item delivered as described!
B008YG6R1I|5|Perfect fit
B00PC0G03E|4|Took a little bit to get on but well worth the effort. Kept the steering wheels original shape. It did start to loose the top sheen pretty quick.
B00XAX4B9A|3|The front shade is okay. The extra two shades that were included do not fit my windows so I was a little disappointed with that being that that was my main reason for purchasing.
B009IFIOB0|5|This product was exactly as advertised.  I had the mirror installed in less than 10 minutes.  Make sure you follow the installation instructions.  This was a great deal compared to what the dealer was going to charge me.  Also, the package was delivered in less than 24 hrs.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I recommend this product to anyone with black interior.
B007J3DJZ4|5|Looks great and was very easy to install.
B002M9W7RQ|5|Well put together,easy to use
B00VU0YWKI|5|I ordered a radiator for a 2007 M35 Infiniti. It arrived on time and works just fine.
B0028NB1SM|4|fits as expected, id recommend measuring your glasses before making a purchase however.
B0006IX85A|5|Have purchased two of these and well......they work. Low point drain on my fresh water holding tanks.
B00II7U2LY|1|I had purchased these spacers with pure excitement and when they were received I quickly and carefully put them on the car. Within weeks if not days I started noticing some odd vibrations but thought nothing of it. I drove with them for a fair amount of time commuting back and forth from the city to the outer more rural area, until they had suddenly collapsed and broke on me. I felt fortunate enough that none of the people in my car including me throughout the time I had them on were injured, but the fact that at anytime we could have been was extremely frightening. The spacers themselves had faulty studs which broke while still attached to my lugs nuts (two of which broke off while I was driving on the front passenger side, so those are lost forever -I even went looking for them- not to mention, that there were other lug nuts that are now unusable due to the stud being lodged in them), and some of them even free spun while on the spacer itself (making the process to remove and make my car safely operable, extremely and unnecessarily difficult).<br /><br />I have contacted the customer service through Amazon sharing with them my issues, and have never once received some sort of reply from them showing actual concern or care to recompense or even remorse for having put my life and the lives of people such as my baby nephew, girlfriend, family members, and friends on the line. They continually try to insure me with some sort of poorly phrased form email telling me that their product is used on track cars and is made of high quality blah blah, regardless of the fact that even if all of those things were true; my car and those spacers were still messed up.<br /><br />I've sent them on at least two if not three different emails, photos proving my claim, and each time they either ignore it all together or try to prolong the process by telling me to send them the photos via Amazon, which on the mobile app and website don't allow for photo attachments. I send it directly totheir Amazon emails which they requested, and even asked for another email to send it to if they were kind enough to even share one with me that would suffice.<br /><br />But now here I am writing this negative review, hating the fact that I'm having to waste my time, just so I can post these dumb photos in a format/means in which they can't ignore. I held no malice towards this company, had no intention of pursuing further legal actions, but they are absolutely ridiculous, and it is beginning to feel like a burden just trying to get my problem addressed. I even told them that I had little hopes for the types of actions they could do to reconcile this, and did not expect much because I'd like to think I understand business can be tough and things do happen, but they have not been at all friendly or caring towards this very serious issue. I am not happy with the sort of repertoire this company has built for itself thus far; and I hope they do something to own up to there inadequacies.<br /><br />I have never written a review before, and this company has forced me to have to. I have more photos of the faulty products, and still have the evidence/broken spacers in a plastic bag in the garage, but for the sake of not wanting to put anymore effort into those review, I've only attached three photos.<br /><br />0/10 would not recommend.
B003TNHETA|1|cheap plastic product, just like everything else that comes from china
B008BE02R8|1|This is the second purchase of the SS H3's and I won't be buying again.  Both packages had one bulb go bad within 2 months of use.
B00LIALCI0|4|Easy to install. Had some feedback problems on the diesel truck it was installed on so had to re position the transmitter.
B0076D5OI2|5|Fits perfectly on onan 5500 marqui generator.
B00EC2CG9U|4|seem fine. made well.
B009X1WQEU|1|Description states it's a Dana 60 gasket. The package came quick but inside was a Dana 30 gasket, which is clearly labeled on the package as a Dana 30 gasket.
B00T5W0O50|5|As expected.
B0108U7XVA|5|Very pleased. Replaced older lights (probably original 1971)  bulbs in my airstream.  They fit right into the original sockets and give good light. Haven't road tested them yet but don't foresee any future problems.
B009AA2FAY|5|worked fine. shut warning light off . no special procedures to go through
B0042NWOLY|2|Does work very well on sprinkler heads<br />As described.
B009HQALNE|4|Good product, but thought it was white from the picture.  It is grey, and should have said so.
B00K8VQE7Y|5|It look so nice. It was at my home in two days fast.
B00HZOBV2K|5|Fit my 2015 Prius  model 4 perfect, bring in the snow and ice.
B008G4IUWW|5|We waited so long to replace the gas tank and if we had known it would be so easy to order one and put it on, we would have done it a long time ago!
B0075JVJPY|5|Nice
B004EDF8HY|5|Brother in law said they were perfect
B00LEXFMC8|3|One of the LED's was out on the driver side headlight, and unless I'm mistaken there's no way to adjust them
B005ETONFA|5|Worked perfectly, we had oil filling in one of our spark plug wells.  They stay dry now!
B00JLUDA84|5|Works goos
B0000AY6AC|5|Good stuff. Have used it for years. Bonds permanently to repairs I've done on wood boats for years.
B0024E6V30|5|ok
B00PAMUACQ|4|Not as thick as I would have liked but look great.
B00AR1LA6K|1|threads did not match factory tow hook would not screw in..
B00BFE2PGC|5|A/C works great now.
B011M3WNB2|5|Gr8 product!
B00BVVFH4Q|5|Great addition to my Wide Glide. Takes all the indiv fork hunting right out.......adds to the stability hof the bike and, if you have or, have riden a WG you know they are top heavy in the front and ten to be tippy, even worse on the highway and wind.
B004RCSS3I|5|Works exactly as advertised.  I like it much better than the velcro hangers I used before.  Just use caution when installing the pieces into the slot in the awning, because they're brittle, and pieces CAN snap off, so take care not to use too much force when inserting them.
B00E1SNULS|4|Everything worked as designed. The anti chatter spring clips fit much looser than the original clips so I just cleaned up and reused the original clips.
B009PQ91O6|3|Part fits perfectly but designed to fail.
B005NLQAHS|5|Great product. I would recommend.
B001LR8SDW|5|Easy to install, didn't come w instructions and I have lees than the average guy for tools. Fits perfectly. I would install on a warm day above 60 degrees if possible and clean the area where the adhesive goes w rubbing alcohol or goo gone just to ensure a proper seal. Same tint as the rear windows!
B00PVE1J50|5|fast shipping works great
B00T9LR2BQ|1|Not sure how I could be less impressed. Original Rain-X on glass makes water truly 'bead', pulling away from the glass surface. Tried this on my face shield, and the rain acted just like water on un-treated glass, with the edges of each drop spreading out and clinging to the plastic surface. Planning to see if Rain-X will trade me for real Rain-X for the car...
B00BP86U7I|5|Fuses work great
B000C5HZ24|5|Fixed the grinding while excellerating on my 09 f150
B004I6HOQA|4|arrived as advertised. Speakers are a huge improvement over the stock Sena 20S-01. I recommend soldering the Tork speakers directly to the Sena unit rather than using the headphone jack.
B000PWVIL8|4|It has improved the ride of the vehicle. Too early to tell if it will last.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Works great. Nice feature is auto shutoff.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|I have this on my john deere gator so far no problems and I love it
B001KQD7NU|1|Lasted almost a year and broke.
B007PLZGO2|4|When I found out there are window stickers like this one, I just had to have one! I immediately bought this one because of how funny it was. A I had a little problem with installing it and I accidentally put it on wrong and C in the Stick didn't come on. But why am I complaining people understand it with or without the c. Apparently, this sticker was so funny, I managed to get out of a speeding ticket because I told the cop where I got it and he let me go! I really like this sticker, may buy another one for my other car.
B00T3TK3EW|5|Great fan
B00276FOFQ|5|Great filter, great price, fast shipping
B00A7YUIO2|5|great
B002UJVNFA|5|Now just the motorcycle
B0096B9XVQ|5|So far so good. Looks to be OEM quality, hopefully it will make it the same 17 years the first one did.
B00P64H6LG|5|Got them in the grill of my 1997 s10 and are stupid bright. Are really alsome at night
B0009PSJ22|5|this item seems to be working very well.  My honey always had a problem in the car with coughing and since I put this in he has not had a problem so  I feel it must be working well.
B00E5XGETY|5|Outstanding product for its price.<br />Fits very well on my 98 Honda prelude. Looks and feels expensive.<br />Please note that this knob gets very hot in the sun but doesn't take long to cool with the ac on.
B00AMLN6YE|4|Think you
B00LA7TYGI|1|Great, made Golf cart look really sporty, also fix great. Thanks !!!!!!
B00KBKOAGY|2|Doesn't fit the card well and caused my sun visor to tilt out.  Too heavy when in use as the visor just won't hold it up without tilting down.  I got this for those days when I forget my perception sunglasses. I would have been better off getting a set of Blue-Blockers or other type of wrap around sunglasses.
B00937YLE2|5|Very good at cleaning streak free.  I would wash them first because they can leave behind some particles if not washed.
B00T8M7UUY|5|I think they look good on my car. And great quality.
B0002NILR4|5|Nice and snug for my 2002 avalanche, looks super dope
B003GC96PO|5|Perfect and much cheaper than camper store
B00D8TWSTQ|1|This one is a farce - it's got to be made by Hillary supporters to get those who oppose Hillary to buy it.  Displaying this on your car would more likely encourage Hillary support than get the message across.  Find another sticker to get your point across.
B009OBW29S|5|Had some water spots and used vinegar to clean....2012 black accord.....washed very good,, used BW with skepticism....awesome pop and shine....also little trick maybe u guys used but I almost immediately removed BW!!!!,,,,awesome job,,,use thick mf towel to remove...flawless...highly recommend!!!!
B00ECH26WM|4|I put these on my Yamaha Vino 125 Scooter.  Easy to fit. Look and work well but the chrome is not very good quality.
B001G77ZWW|5|very good!
B001UK4Z28|1|too heavy , too stiff, very hard to put on & take off & gets caught in the wind!!!
B0002JM69W|2|A puny product. Maybe suitable for young children, but not adults. The aerating wire coils are barely one-half inch in diameter.
B000TYU14C|3|These were only pins, no bushings.  I needed bushings!
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I love the car sun shade! In fact, this is the 2nd one I purchased. My friend saw mine and asked if I could order one for her. The shade covers the window so completely, not a ray a light can enter. The quality of the material is excellent. I am a very happy customer :-).
B004I0MYWA|1|Does not fit my car
B0009JKGJC|3|I bought this at my local ace hardware store and I have to say, it had a spectacular shine... for a few days. I have used chrome polish that had lasted for a month. It does not work as a rust remover so don't be fooled by it being a 2 in 1
B00WNQGYHC|3|Bought for a 2014 jetta.  It did not fit.  There isn't a bracket to make them work. Had to return them.  Did not realize that the cover for the lights had to be removed. I probably would have turned them had they fit. leaving the cover off and exposing the inside of the light to dirt/ rain would be problematic.
B0036IQ90S|5|Work fine
B0002V9IFU|5|Smells good
B00CZG6WO0|5|Works great.  Brighter than original lights
B000CIGDGU|2|Some peices were missing and the instructions are very limited to the modification needed to install this.
B002E343F4|5|great
B006NYHIJI|5|Great Product!!! fast Shipping!!
B0093KSGCC|5|OEM replacement - needed a spare for another vehicle to make change-out easy.
B00FEN5332|5|Worked as described, Much cheaper alternative!
B0002NILQU|3|It fits the wheel's circumference with a few strong pulls but it is not thick enough to cover the width of my F150's steering wheel. For what I paid, it will do.
B000C7XU4E|1|the door lock did not work
B0080DFZJK|5|Good for the look. But really annoying to take off
B00EB8F5BQ|1|wrong length
B000C44CHG|5|FORD EXPLORER FEELS MUCH BETTER NOW!
B009HL6GCY|5|2011 Titan....this fixed the problem, item as described, works flawlessly
B001PBTRYI|1|This pump didn't work as expected. It worked when cold, but not when warmed up. I've purchased this brand of other items in the past. Most of the items worked good. The pumps are very problematic. All of the pumps have either had issues or functioned like this one. I've wasted enough time on this brand of pumps and won't be buying them in the future. Spend the little extra money and get a NEW, NON oem  pump for just a few dollars more. The ones at the stealership are ridiculously high priced.
B0094MF3F2|4|Good stickers but the lines on the side are a little small but it's ok.
B00KTKF86W|5|Correct part  worked,  not much price break however
B0056J2ZGC|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B00WE6BHUK|4|It's cute
B00080QHMM|5|Works great and I haven't replaced the battery yet.
B001F0NNR6|3|The mirror is easy to install but flimsy in feel.  They describe a gloss black but the actual product is closer to matte black.  Nothing a can of clear coat paint can't fix.
B009WDX1NE|5|Unfortunately, we sold our bike and it does not fit the new bike :(
B001P4IQI8|1|product does not fit my 2012 sprinter and I couldn't return there was not button ,,,so im stuck with this garbage ,,mine needs on with a electric sensor
B002UC8LZW|5|perfect
B00GMOI98S|5|I used this to apply some dynomat like sound deadener.  Worked great.
B00S9OM09S|5|I was given this product in exchange for a review.Such a cute add on to my beetle! The perfect amount of bling, just what i needed! I tried to pick off the gems and they were on there really good, I could not get any of them off. But just in case they did add extras in the box which is great! I am so happy i bought these! My car is happy too!
B00OSVGZHY|5|I received the bars on time, but when I opened the box up, one of the bars didn't have the rubber gaskets on them. I contacted the seller, and they sent me (2) new gaskets right away, at no charge. These installed very easily, with no issues. They look great, and for the price, you can't beat it. Would buy again.
B00NF1RLC6|5|Perfect fit.
B005FNKFZ2|5|Good quality. Just as described
B000HKVDKE|5|I like them.
B00BFZK66M|5|Perfect form, fit and function
B007JSGR9Y|3|Only basic info Wont give Vehicle Info or give other functions just codes and basic info at that!
B000QSE8I6|4|good
B002TKYVI6|3|Seam to make more wind nose.  but could see very good...  thank you...  dk.
B00651C2E0|3|Floppy and blows over on the highway. But no loss in reception from factory antenna. The only thing I wish was better was that it was made for each make and not some screw on adapters . On the 2014 Silverado it has to have a little adapter which makes it stick out from the trim instead of nice and flush if it was made propely for the vehicle i wouldve given it more stars.
B004SSAFAA|5|A+
B00CGGXRK6|4|Easy to install, works great.
B007R6JSOY|1|The pieve does not fit in my k5. The inner lights wont go in the grille.
B00KG577UA|2|slid around on seat.A towel would work just as well.
B003AOF1IY|4|Bought these for my wife's 2012 Mazda 3.  The fit is decent, but I have little to no experience with replacement seat covers. To me, they seemed a little baggy in the seating area, but that might just be the nature of the beast.
B008PJY5J0|5|Original equipment. Works perfectly. Half dealer cost for part alone.
B004XG2FPA|4|Installed on a 2000 Honda Osyssey. Concealed right below the rear bumper, you can barely tell it's there. Doesn't seem to have an issue pulling a small 8' trailer with a mower and 4 wheeler either.
B000BQWHDQ|5|when you are hooked up to the sewer when you are camping, there are no mishaps with the hose coming out of the drain. nice product
B004TNEFXC|5|fit great
B00YTYMBQE|3|Looks pretty good and it arrived on time.  You will definitely need to read the instructions to figure out how to set the watch.  The English instructions are humorous as they appear to be google translated directly from Chinese.  As I can tell, the pros are the price and that it is water proof.  This is important for my daughter who is a swimmer.  The cons are that it is hard to set, and some of the smaller indicators on the watch screen (like AM or PM, etc) would require a magnifying glass to see.  Overall, it seems to be ok for a cheap watch.
B00HBHY8H6|5|great decals. Bought 2
B002ZBPXGS|5|Great
B0013ERRSK|5|I have three dogs and our other water bottle was too small. They absolutely Love this one!!! Its hot in summer in Louisiana. Its important to keep them well hydrated when we play outdoors. The water does not spill. Im so glad i found this product. I wish there were more summer products for dogs and withstanding the heat. I like that they can have refridgerated water when we are out in heat. One of my dogs has had several heat strokes and it is scarey.
B000BVRZ74|5|great one i like it
B009NVV4TI|5|Fit perfectly.  Nice product at a great price.
B00PAECK6I|5|Just because you install this carb doesnt automaically gain speed..first of you need adjust your fuel ratios..check if your trottle line is snug fit..also if it standard cable like mine shave of 1 inch from housing and cut lacing from there is plug and play.after you fire up your engine you must do fine tunning...to idle correcly as well.as.it open 100%..if it doesnt do that tune again..thats the main reason some doesnt gain because tunning  or adjust fuel  mixture ..me.personally i runs on  19:1 on hot days..cd days anyways from 25:1 to 20:1.  Assumming you broke engine in already..with these 3 fuel ratios..i still top around 35-40mph but i most run around 20mph because i dont like redlinning or get unwanted police attentions
B00D8E0SRA|5|Bought for some one else. Price and shipping was darn good. That's why 5 stars.
B00DSNN9EK|5|Pulled dark smudges from headliner without a trace!

B002UXBELY|4|better than standard halogen
B00DSCZ0U2|5|The lift supports are working great. Easy to intall. Intructions were right on and the price was very reasonable, compared to Mercedes prices.Thanks
B000N9TI2E|5|we live on our sailboat and tried several cabin fans, this one seems to work the best, very quite and 2 speeds, draws very little! We have 5 in our sailboat, very happy with them
B006CR74ZE|4|It doesn't come with anything to attach it with
B00JIIZCM6|5|Worked perfectly, I was amazed.
B0000ATZCE|5|Great product.  I use it to secure my bikes on my bike rack.
B00PSRORH2|5|works well!
B0075SCNXC|5|thx
B00LDRA49Q|4|One of my lights take forever to come on. I have to cut it on and off a few times to get it to come on. One of my lights is the 10000k blue and one has a pinkish tint. Would have rated a 5 star but the light color was off on one light.
B00881EQ1C|5|Rubber materials makes the frame very bendable to curve around the bumper.  Cushioned screw holes protects the bumper from damage.  Holds the plate firmly in place.
B00UDK58Z4|5|Good for mini cooper s r56
B003WOXOD6|3|Not the best quality, cable was lodged in when I got it, but it works well enough for the price.
B00PANW6R2|3|Look good but they have problems with auto seat belt rewind
B002YKMCDW|4|I have been using the round plug gapper for years, along with feeler gauges for more precise work.  However, I think the A & E Hand Tools 4450A is going to become my 'go to' gapper.  Very easy to use, MADE IN THE USA, bright orange handle, comfortable to hold.  I would give it a 5 Star rating if I could more easily see the markings.  Unless you hold it in the right light, these old eyes just have a hard time picking out the stamped markings.  The bright chrome finish reflects the overhead lights which makes it harder to read.  I have some plugs that need to be gapped at under .020,  so if the lower limit went to .015, it would help me (a personal 'wish', but not a deal breaker).  Overall, I like the tool and have already used it a few times.
B00LCWUF3C|5|They fit and look amazing very glad I bought them, you won't be sorry you did either! They added the perfect touch to my wheels and tires on the truck
B007F2114K|5|Very durable like Steve himself.
B004QM7V46|2|says 12, i wear a 11.5, it is way to tight on me, extreamly hard to get on.
B00A4542H8|4|very nice, goes on on/off easily and doesn't mark non-paint. got enough out of one container for a honda crv and a toyota sienna.
B004QQCEO4|4|I guess I will say I like it.....though I haven't used it yet.  I bought it along with the R-12 replacement stuff to put into our pristine 1992 Miata that does not produce any cool air any more through the air conditioner.  More on this after I put a can of the stuff into the system and see what happens.
B006STTIVY|5|Works well
B000BGHTK2|5|Good quality. Great price
B0009VA8OS|1|Need to send back not good got on freeway and the top flew off
B0038B1ABQ|5|Quick and easy replacement.  Makes the front of my 1999 F250 look almost brand new.  It took me 30 minutes to replace both lights.  I also bought replacement retaining clips and the bent awl as suggested by others.  The bent awl was the perfect tool for removing the retaining clips.  I still bent the clips removing them and dropped one.  Having the new clips just made things easier but are not required if you are carefull.  These lights did come with the headlight bulbs, but not the maker or turnsignal bulb.  I ordered orange turn signal bulbs at the same time and reused my maker light bulbs.  I did replace the headlight bulbs with the Sylvannia 9007 SilerStar Ultra High Performance bulbs.  With these lenses and bulbs my headlights are now brighter than ever.  It took a few times adusting the lights before I got them aimed where I wanted them, but it was very easy.
B000NKCIKM|5|Have used before and will use again.  Not sure it's better than any of the others, but how can one really be sure without spending a ton of $$$ on an oil analysis??
B0048E9YLA|3|A little disappointed in quality but can live with it.
B00DYSDSAY|5|They fit...time will tell how long they last.  They don't look like they would stand up to a harsh winter...but I'll give them a shot!
B000C930YM|5|Prefect
B00KZJQ2L2|5|This sunshade is HUGE!  Fits my Ram 1500 perfectly.  Perfect choice for trucks and SUVs.  Good quality, and it folds up nice and small to fit perfectly in my door.  Keeps my truck nice and cool.  A little tricky to figure out how to fold at first, but after you play with it a couple times it's easy.  Also, the company sends you a pdf with folding instructions in case you can't get it.
B008BVUCS0|5|This looks great on the truck
B000CSQEV4|5|This is the best buy at any price.  Works great and more power.
B00E1IY5QM|5|Perfect!
B00C908EQ6|5|Great, Great, Great
B00QK40UZA|5|Blades are of good quality, fit with no problems. Have used blades several times in heavy rain with no issues. I recommend these wiper blades, has been on car for a couple of months.
B001BCM39C|5|As described. Perfect fit. On time shipping.  2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.
B0006JLW84|5|Super great prices and fast service. Camco quality!
B00DSGI9JC|5|Works great awesome box
B004YMRIC8|4|good to clean rims
B001AH7GSQ|5|The coils that I put on my 2005 1500, 4x4, short box, reg. cab, 5.7, 142K m.  were the last performance mod to the truck before going to the dyno tuner. The truck idles and runs perfect. Pulled 265 rw hp @ 6000' 90 degree day 15% humidity. I'm sure the coils have some input into that. Very easy to install. Look good too.<br />Tom  Denver, CO
B00KMM6A6Y|3|Having to leave 3 stars only bexause of excellent quality of service. However, the product is not as advertized in terms of the brightness of the Amberlight. Amber Light is significantly lower brightness on my '11 Impreza. I'm not sure why this is as the white's on the other hand extremely bright
B000GZNB1E|5|Everything was as described thank you!
B009789R1Y|5|Totally awesome
B00H3WOPRM|5|Works fine so far; 1/3 cost of the dealer.  Amazing how much Cadillac rips you off.
B007GEOA9A|5|Great.  Getting veteran acknowledgments while driving.  &#34;Thank you for your service&#34;
B0067UETAY|5|Solved the issue of my blower only working on level 5! Easy to replace, works perfectly.
B001Y8HAZ0|1|Nice heavy duty heat shield,but it left gaps on both sides of the windshield ,and there was a two to three inch gap around the lane departure unit at the top of my windshield.I have a heat shield that only cost $10.00 and it covers better than the covercraft unit!!!!!!
B0082365AQ|1|What a disappointment. I purchased two carts for two kayaks. I was only able to use one of the carts and that was only because I replaced the factory strap with better one the factory strap kept coming undone  The other cart could not be used the tires were defected they could not be pumped FLAT!!
B0084UJTWI|5|I was excited to get this in the mail and to have a matching set of floor mats for my new to me 2008 Silverado.<br /><br />I took it out of the box and dropped it in the back. Fit like a charm and there wasn't any trimming needed. Already saved me from the kid spilling something back there.<br /><br />The mat was a little Mia shaped from being in the box for so long, a few days in the hot truck fixed that for me.<br /><br />Great product.
B000BYB1WQ|5|part is good; fixed my boat
B00DEU1C0A|5|I replaced the ones that were failing with these, and they worked fantastic, pretty easy installation even though I don't do this stuff much.  Save a good amount of cash.  It took me a minute to realize that you replace the ball connectors with the ones that come with it,  as well, for some reason.
B00RCFC7TS|5|I love these LED Lights. They are a brighter red than my LED brake lights but not to the extent that they throw the motif off. I would recommend this product.
B005JU5VH8|5|Product performed better than advertised!!!
B002HSD19A|2|I particularly wanted Rampage door skins to match my Rampage top. Unfortunately, the door skins were too small to fit on my 1999 upper door frames even though I followed the instructions and left them to bake and stretch for several hours in the Florida summer heat and sun. Despite multiple attempts, I wasn't able to get more than one of the four corners to fit on the frame at the same time. I finally gave up and took advantage of Amazon's excellent return policy and returned these. I subsequently purchased the Smittybilt door skins and they fit easily on the upper door frames.
B00QAMKNYK|5|Greatt kit for a great price
