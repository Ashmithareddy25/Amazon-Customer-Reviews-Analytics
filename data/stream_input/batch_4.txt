B00CCEHR80|5|Just what I expected.
B00688628M|5|All parts are superbly cast and the acting is great.  I would recommend this to anyone else I know.  It is however very old and most people have already seen it at least once.
B004DLPXAO|1|I couldn't find any of the books I had downloaded to my zoom tablet. What happened?
B004LWZWGK|1|Ultraviolet said you could download and watch this item on your IPad.  This is a lie.  The operating software will not let you watch it.  I will only buy movies with digital copy from now on.  I only bought this so I could keep a copy of it on my IPad.  Now that I can't it was a complete waste.
B00FATEJYE|5|I think this game is great the characters are awesome to and the game is really good with earning characters and learning new moves
B00FMQILBC|5|I got these for my granddaughter - she loves them.

B000GIWS7E|5|i bought this for my hubby ... he is such  big fan of this band.... he enjoyed it sooo much....it was a great buy....You should try it too :)
B007IQX1G4|2|I like to watch a train wreck of a character as much as the next person, but this was too sad even for me.
B005S9EJ46|4|Touching feel good movie.  A small group of retiree's each with their own reason, go on holiday to the newly restored Marigold.  They're in for a surprise and the story follows each of them as they discover what they were really looking for.  Humorous with a nicely written story.  The actors are first class.
B0067R0APK|5|Tons of great weather info and extras
B004VMUS9G|5|Does exactly what it says it will do.
B006VRDZ44|5|good story and actors.
B0058YPL66|5|Great, kids love this show, arived on time, good value. Would recomend. Better priced than in stores would order again.
B004GJDQT8|5|I have been a prime member for a long time. They keep raising the annual membership for prime. I don't watch movies or music, but I do enjoy down loading some free books on my Kindle once in a while. I enjoy the free PRIME Membership shipping since I order many things from Amazon almost every week. I especially appreciate the customer reviews on products on Amazon. That really helps  me decide if I want the products and who I can trust selling on Amazon.
B0086700CM|4|The only gripe I had was there was no map or diagram of the course, or a way to slow the character down to get used to him.  It would be nice to have a speed selector and a diagram of the course.  He got killed way to easy... at least I got him killed off right away.  But the game has great graphics and is fun to play for a while till all that happens is the runner dies.
B000VKW7AK|5|This compilation exceeded expectations. Very good distribution of hits and demos, and the two concerts are very cool as well.
B00A0SQBDM|4|Not a bad game, pretty fun to play
B001BANK32|5|I couldn't put it down. I had seen the movie but the book way better. Very intense and scary. Definitely recommend it.
B0089LOG02|5|Lovely story about a period in history I knew little about. Well written in simple prose. Might be of interest to a young reader. The plot development is a lite too \\"happy ever after\\" but it makes for a pleasant read.
B00003CXAR|5|Just bought this DVD yesterday,I pop this disc on my player sit on my couch and when I saw the movie the picture look great! it was so clear and  bright.The DTS sound was ok I give it 4 star for it,the widescreen format  is good too is better then pan-n-scan version.The DVD got a good extra to  keep you busy for 1hrs. and Universal Studio done a great job in putting  JAWS on DVD.DA-DUM DA-DUM
B001PPGAIA|4|The dvd arrived withing a few days of ordering it. It arrived in excellent condition. I was happy with  the service. We're planning a trip to Australia and even though it was set in a different time period the landscape was amazing and the story line was riviting.
B000U1ZV8K|5|very nice

B0025UHKNS|5|Been using this for a month now and so far no problem with the device. Love the Virtual Partner as it gives me some challenge during my run. Good online price compared if you buy it in store.     Wished there were other colors for this. Only available in light blue and I feel like it's more for ladies.     Good Garmin product! Accurate!
B00PTB7B34|5|It's good if you like clash of clans and all that
B005LAIII0|5|&#34;And so it is with God&#34;.  A brilliant adaptation, and a true feast for the eyes.
B009LQKHIO|5|A very enjoyable novel. The characters were interesting and nice. The story was well written. I can hardly wait to read the next adventure.
B000WGWQG8|5|Now that I have seen the whole of this mini serie, I'm still more impressed that the first time I wrote an opinion for this dvd.      I bought this product on Amazon.com, because when I learned the existence of this mini-serie by watching the Emmy Awards on a French channel, the subject seemed interesting for me, but there was no way at this time to see it in France : John Adams is an American President fully unknown in our country, and it wouldn't be commercial to air it or to release such a dvd in stores. Now in March 2011, we begin to see it on small cable channels TV and two or three copies in retail stores.      As for foreigners, it doen't present problem : the serie is subtitled (at least in French) and so is the first extra (but not the making of). Each episode is very long to see ; the average length is more than 1 hour, and you have to see it twice to read the English subtitles giving the historical context of what is narrated.    According to my opinion, the performance of Paul Giamatti and other actors is quite remarkable. The box set is very beautiful with its golden yellow.    I spoke about this serie with a French friend of mine working in the US who saw it on American TV : he was astonished that during this second US Administration, there was a war between France and the US. Almost nobody in France knows something about this war. I told him that according my poor knowledge, two wars confronted France and the US : the one of 1797-1798, and one on the 8th of November 1942 in Casablanca, Morocco. On both cases, the French army was defeated by the US. I told him also that it was during John Adam's administration, and because of this war, that the US Navy and the Marine Corps were created and are still existing today.     My friend concluded that he had to read an history of the United States to have a better knowledge of the country where he is working now !    For the same reasons, I encourage more French people to buy this miniserie DVD. Obviously youhave to be interested in history. But first it's an enthusiastic performance,specially the one of Paul Giamatti and also of the actress performing the character of Abigail, and second they will learn historical facts not taught in French schools.   Frankly speaking, we don't see much of the first US-French war, but on the opposite we can see Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Adams in Versailles. and if this mini serie was composed only of this part, it would be enough to say that it's far superior to Sofia Copplola's movie about Marie-Antoinette, queen of France.    But apart of this, I learnt a lot of interesting items such as the way the Declaration of Independance was signed, how they treated smallpox or breast cancer in the 18th century. And more surprising than anything else, how a Chief Executive of the USA could walk alone in infamous parts of Philadelphia to meet his son.    Who could imagine such things for a US President today ?    Conclusion : buy it and you will have enriched your knowledge for quite a reasonable price !
B0000019PA|5|It seems that the narrative aspect of Aeroplane is being missed.  At the first few listenings it isn't obvious, but once you really delve into the lyrics it is more apparent.  And no, it isn't a tight knit story, so that makes it harder to hear too.  It seems that it is about a boy who falls in love with a Jewish girl who is then killed by the Nazis.  Of course this is just my theory, but I think that it makes sense.  It ties the weirder lyrics together, and it also gives the \\"I love you Jesus Christ\\" line real meaning.

0790729385|5|This is THE ultimate horror movie. However, it goes beyond the typical blood and guts...it instills an instinctual fear toward the unknown - DEMONIC POSESSION! This movie depicts what is not only assumed to be real -  it was based on a true story, not a directors imagination. If you keep that  in mind while you watch this movie - i guarantee you will feel fear like  none you've felt before - it is THAT frightening! This is the only movie  that scares me more as an adult than it did when i was a child - because it  takes advantage of what you know...and what you DON'T know about the  underworld. ...So sit back, open your mind, and prepare to run to church -  it's THE EXORCIST!

B00005A46T|3|Like their previous release, Slipknot relies on unimaginative overdone speed riffs and screaming to sell records, it just becomes so boring.  At times though the band shows its ability to write some very clever songs, like &quot;Left Behind Full&quot;, just really really clever, but its so drowned out by yelling and monotonous playing that its almost not worth listening to.  Almost that is.  Other really good songs, Everything Ends, which has some really cool riffs, but same story, just drowned out by really unimaginitive playing.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|It's a very good game
B00PRX8UBG|5|I admit it.  I found this movie totally by accident.  I was surfing through the long list of movie channels looking for something to play in the background while I wrote and came across this.  I flipped to it without even reading the info so I had no clue what to expect going in.  Honestly, once I realized it was about jazz music, I figured I would hate it because I am not a huge fan of jazz.  However….<br /><br />The casting is excellent!  Teller and J.K. Simmons play off of each other perfectly.  Teller’s character is driven and determined.  Simmons’ character is downright scary.  Period.  Their screen chemistry was just intense.  The writing is solid and the music is amazing.  I would totally recommend this movie to anyone, regardless of your normal tastes.  It’s totally worth the watch.
B00AUN2HBW|5|This is one of those stories that endures the test of time.

B007QA3AH2|5|Love Tim Allen and the best Sigourney Weaver ever looked.  Great spoof on Star Trek with a slightly serious turn and a chance for redemption of some shallow, self absorbed characters.  Loved this movie...sorry Tim Allen never did a follow up.
B0011Z33ES|5|Very inspirational music & his voice is so beautiful.  I listen to it at work & everyone always asks who is that...he sings beautiful. His music helps because I work  in a stressful atmosphere & it is calming & uplifting.
B00P5968FC|4|Very good acting from both the mother and child.<br />A much better movie than I thought it would be...and much better than many large budget releases.<br />Great example of what Kickstarter can fund to life.<br /><br />Ending was a bit odd...but still a great flick.

B00000J631|4|This is a great CD but the songs are too short.  If they really wanted to get 101 bands on an album they should have released a few discs, but what can you do?  Now, onto the CD.  It has great songs by Blink 182, which is  just a bunch of foul language, NoFx, White Flag, Black Flag, Anti-Flag,  Ataris, and AFI.  There are however some really bad bands.(Lunachicks)  The  best thing about this CD is that the songs featured are not the best songs  by each band.  It is great in that it gives you the opportunity to discover  101 bands for eight bucks.  If you bought a CD from each of the bands on  here you would spend almost $1500, OUCH!  One more thing, there is a  confused reviewer talking about 5 yrs on the streets, which is another  great punk comp, but don't get them confused. they say blink's  &quot;Dancing w/ Myself is on here but it's not.  They also say NoFx is not  on here.  So just watch out.

B00FN2KR2G|5|When I first bought this book I thought it was about these little old ladies solving crimes. Wow was I wrong. This was a very intricate tale. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not about to spoil it for any one. All I can say is read this delightful,delicious tale. It's funny, intriguing,  and truly a page turner. You will be pleasantly surprised as was I. I really loved it.

B001LX2J22|4|Its a pretty good movie if you already into the Silence of the Lambs movies.  Still not as good as the original, its worth the watch.
B00F91RYL8|1|This movie was the worst I have seen in years. I hope you can save yourself the time and aviod the waist of time and money. I understand some may just love this type of movie. I should have known if Brad Pitt was in it, it would be a bomb.
B002ZG993Q|1|I dont know what the good reviews are about, I don't understand exactly what it is these good reviewers saw in this movie, after reading them I was convinced I would like this movie, I didn't even come close to liking it. After the insteresting beginning, where Clooney and his girl are threatened by assasins, I spent the whole movie waiting for something interesting to happen til the credits were shown I got the message that this so called movie was over.      My guess is that the director wanted to portray the lonely life of a veteran hitman and the package that comes with such a life, don't get me wrong the movie is well performed, I just don't agree that this is an interesting way of telling a story.        A lot of people think that with no dialogue, no emotion, not a hint of an interesting plot, that the filmaker is letting the spectator come to its own conclusions, but I wouldn't care reaching conclusions from a dull and pointless storyline as this movie has, and I like the type of movie this director (is my guess) tried to make, but in my opinion he missed the mark completely.       My other guess about the good reviews are what people like to see in this movie, what inspired them just by showing good actors with little dialogue, the fact is that this movie only gets mentioned because Clooney is the main character. So for me watching this movie is as interesting as watching paint dry.
B000002KYR|4|Some people like slick, some like gritty. Some like their music to have a polished studio sound, others an organic natural grunge. I happen to like both and this ZZ Top title satisfies my ears and mind just right ! Hardcore ZZ Top fans have bashed this album for its early MTV pop appeal and others who grew up glued to MTV love it. I am in neither category but am able to appreciate and enjoy Eliminator just the same after all these years. Yes, it's electronically slick. Yet, that ZZ Top trademark sound of blues/rock is unmistakeable and easily identifiable despite the &quot;studio-electricity&quot; flowing through it (yes, I have heard some of their earlier works as well). Eliminator had it's own unique individual and distinctive electric guitar and bass, drum driven sound that no other pop-rock bands or new wave groups of the time possessed or dared to even come close to !
B003XRDYX2|5|Commenting on the music found here is pretty much irrelevant, anyone who's found their way to this collection, or this package, is already familiar with the work of Bob Dylan ... probably the most influential musician of the last hundred years, if not of all time.  That leaves me with the production and presentation; though the most important aspect, the selling point, is that these are mono releases of Mr. Dylan's work.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, there is only one reason to purchase a mono recording, and that's if the original mono recording has been reprocessed for stereo.  At one time nearly all of Elvis Presley's material was converted to stereo, leaving the original mono recordings to be thrown in the trash, where they were found and saved.  A true mono recording is a totally different ball of wax.  Recordings done in true mono jump out at you, there's no fading from one channel to the other, no mixing and blending of vocals for a full bodied, full room feel.  Mono recordings are in your face, everything comes out at you full throttled, thick with atmosphere, but very one dimensional.  During the years Dylan recorded his early work, home electronics were in a state of major flux.  To be honest with you, most people only had 45 rpm record changers, and those who had the ability to play albums were pretty much limited to mono play, even though some of those systems had dual speakers ... and what most people don't remember from those days, was that these early platter systems played 78's as well as 33's and 45's, and contained a different cartridge for each.<br /><br />Dylan's work, as well as many other artists of the time, were released as both mono and stereo productions.  I won't argue that perhaps due to the technology, the mono may have sounded stronger, but in reality, that was due to the limitations of the equipment.  Yes, you're getting a really nice production here, heavy vinyl that's been created with high end efficiency, on state of the art production equipment, for state of the art equipment.  That brings up yet another issue, mono recordings require a mono stylus ... playing a mono record using a stereo stylus presents further limitations, leaving one to consider whether after purchasing these rather pricey records, one wants to take the time to install a new cartridge each time you want to play these babies.<br /><br />I now find myself at a particular juncture that I do not enjoy being at ... and that is that Bob Dylan, and perhaps those who guide him, have latched onto the notion of the concept of nostalgia, and that people of my generation, and younger, are willing to purchase just about anything the Thin Man serves up.  Listen, I love Dylan, but he has become his own worst enemy, he has become corporate America \\"... in the instant that he speaks.\\"  This is the same guy who sits at his desk, blows through a five set box of harmonicas, and sells them for thousands of dollars, and even more if you have the bucks to shell out for one that he's used for one song while on tour.  It's like those people who think they have a flag that's flown over the White House, we all know the image that brings to mind, but the truth is that there are a group of men who run a flag up over the White House every minute of the day, and then pass them off as flags that have flown over the White House ... truth and dishonesty all mixed to the point where we can't see night from day, and Desolation Row has been co-opted and gentrified by upstarts with too much money to even burn.<br /><br />But ... and quoting from Phil Gallo, a man I've spoken with many times on the subject of His Royal Bobness:<br /><br />\\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" (From \\"Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,\\" 1963)  Sundazed did a mono vinyl pressing in 2001 that minimized the tape-speed variation in the beginning of the track. Dylan sounds old on the vinyl version; his guitar crisper than on any CD version. The naturalness of his voice comes through on the new mono CD, especially from the middle of the song to the end. Here's the dig: On the original Columbia vinyl, Dylan's voice is significantly pronounced above the rhythm guitar which begs the question: Is it more important to make it sound good or sound as it did upon release? The SACD is an example of an exquisite mix with the voice in the middle, guitar on one side and harmonica on the other. Winner: The Sundazed vinyl.<br /><br />\\"All Along the Watchtower\\" (From \\"John Wesley Harding,\\" 1967) The SACD was a mixed bag. The vocals were so clear you could hear Bob's voice cracking and going every which way -- is that a gulp between \\"princes\\" and \\"kept the view?\\" But the drums sound like a snare and an empty ice cream tub, and the harmonica is piercing. The vinyl is pleasant, but lacking in dynamics. The new mono version solves all of that, with Charles McCoy's bass giving the tune a previously buried charge. The Winner: Mono Box.<br /><br />\\"Mr Tambourine Man\\" (From \\"Bringing It All Back Home,\\" 1965) The original vinyl mono takes the song's three elements -- voice, acoustic guitar and electric guitar and delicately places them in a perfect lineup. The SACD added clarity to each element, splitting the two guitars into separate channels. But the acoustic dwarfs the electric -- if the vocal is at 10, the acoustic is at 8 and the electric at 3. The mono CD version is a beautiful reproduction of the the original mono. Winner: Mono Box.<br /><br />\\"Just Like a Woman\\" (From \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" 1966) The new mono version does what the original mono version did it brings out the venom in Dylan's voice and gives the acoustic guitar lines a pronounced placement. There's minimal difference between the stereo and mono versions, and it boils down to a personal preference do you want the acoustic guitar, organ and drums between the chorus and verses to move horizontally or vertically? In stereo, they swing from one side back and forth across the playing field; in mono, they stack up like building blocks. Winner: Mono Box.<br /><br />\\"One Too Many Mornings\\" (From \\"The Times They Are a-Changin',\\" 1964) This is one of his more interesting early vocal presentations in which he experiments with shifting away from the didactic. The tonal shifts from the steely to the welcoming, lecturer to lullaby singer are in evidence in all the versions. The original mono vinyl release had a curious mix in which Dylan's vocals and harmonica dominate the recording, sounding as if the guitar is being played by another musician seated a few feet from where Dylan is standing. The 2005 stereo CD version has a more natural sound than the mono or stereo vinyl and the separation of components is not as apparent as on other tracks. The new mono version is a bit of a resolution, a combination of the best elements of both versions. The winner: Mono Box.<br /><br />\\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" (From \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" 1965) This is the greatest rock song ever, and in the top five of greatest records ever made, so even listening to a third generation cassette on a 20-year-old Walkman could not conceal its greatness or depth. That said, the original mono mix on vinyl emphasized a Wall of Sound quality with Dylan's vocals run through a heavy reverb effect. Part of the magic is that, as wide open as his voice is, it remains in your face. The mono CD version exposes a greater clarity in the instruments as the echo is reduced in the mix early on. Both mono versions use that electric guitar riff before the line \\"you used to go to the finest schools\\" to increase the dramatic effect, while the SACD version exposes a grinding quality to the rhythm guitar in the final third that is not as apparent in mono. The winner: Draw.<br /><br />\\"John Wesley Harding\\" It comes as a bit of a surprise that the album that benefits most in the mono presentation is the last one in the set, 1967's \\"John Wesley Harding,\\" which was released at a time when most people had given up on the mono format. The mono presentationenhances the intimacy of the country-folk collection of sparse guitar-bass-drums tunes. It's easy to picture Dylan, McCoy and drummer Kenny Buttrey plowing through \\"Drifter's Escape,\\" \\"Down Along the Cove,\\" and the title track with little concern for the intricacies of a consistent vocal performance, or where a lead guitar riff might be placed. It's a rustic gem that seems to go in and out of favor. The mono version might resolve that fluctuation and get it ranked permanently among his top tier discs.<br /><br />And back to me:  There's power in these recordings, and in these mono formats, though the value is absolutely personal.  These mono mixes present Dylan as he may have sounded for an in studio concert, with the band riding far behind him, presenting Dylan, his vocals, and his ideas front and center.  But ... score these as compact discs and you've lost it all, yes, the surface noise, an aspect I've spent a lifetime running from, is part of the necessary listening experience.  Me [?], I don't really care anymore, I've got an eight speaker surround system, and intend to blow out the room every time I load a disc ... I love these bright gold pieces of plastic, for the most part, I don't miss records in the least ... though I will give this set 5 Stars, I'm just glad that I didn't have to pay for it.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerblocks.

The new mono version is a bit of a resolution, a combination of the best elements of both versions. The winner: Mono Box.<br /><br />\\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" (From \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" 1965) This is the greatest rock song ever, and in the top five of greatest records ever made, so even listening to a third generation cassette on a 20-year-old Walkman could not conceal its greatness or depth. That said, the original mono mix on vinyl emphasized a Wall of Sound quality with Dylan's vocals run through a heavy reverb effect. Part of the magic is that, as wide open as his voice is, it remains in your face. The mono CD version exposes a greater clarity in the instruments as the echo is reduced in the mix early on. Both mono versions use that electric guitar riff before the line \\"you used to go to the finest schools\\" to increase the dramatic effect, while the SACD version exposes a grinding quality to the rhythm guitar in the final third that is not as apparent in mono. The winner: Draw.<br /><br />\\"John Wesley Harding\\" It comes as a bit of a surprise that the album that benefits most in the mono presentation is the last one in the set, 1967's \\"John Wesley Harding,\\" which was released at a time when most people had given up on the mono format. The mono presentationenhances the intimacy of the country-folk collection of sparse guitar-bass-drums tunes. It's easy to picture Dylan, McCoy and drummer Kenny Buttrey plowing through \\"Drifter's Escape,\\" \\"Down Along the Cove,\\" and the title track with little concern for the intricacies of a consistent vocal performance, or where a lead guitar riff might be placed. It's a rustic gem that seems to go in and out of favor. The mono version might resolve that fluctuation and get it ranked permanently among his top tier discs.<br /><br />And back to me:  There's power in these recordings, and in these mono formats, though the value is absolutely personal.  These mono mixes present Dylan as he may have sounded for an in studio concert, with the band riding far behind him, presenting Dylan, his vocals, and his ideas front and center.  But ... score these as compact discs and you've lost it all, yes, the surface noise, an aspect I've spent a lifetime running from, is part of the necessary listening experience.  Me [?], I don't really care anymore, I've got an eight speaker surround system, and intend to blow out the room every time I load a disc ... I love these bright gold pieces of plastic, for the most part, I don't miss records in the least ... though I will give this set 5 Stars, I'm just glad that I didn't have to pay for it.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B004JN1D2I|5|As I finish each chapter I say &#34;I can't believe that just happened&#34;,this is really a great read although really long.
B00CWY76CC|5|A rare treat to find a game that gradually increases the ttdifficulty level while still remaining truly fun and<br />interesting to play.  I just have to remember to pay attention to everything I see ina room. I can go back and<br />Look at a particular item over and over again to double check if I have the correct let's say color order in that<br />moment it's needed. I haven't run across anything yet that I couldn't solve simply by paying more attention to the<br />details and double checking things if needed.<br /><br />A real great game that's relaxing and a real pleasure to play!<br /><br />What am I missing on Lvl 5? I can only get about half of the Lvov done.  Any help souled be appreciated!! Thanks so very much!!
B005CMSDKA|4|First, I liked this movie, and violated my $10 limit rule for blu-ray (having paid $14 total) to buy it.<br />For the full story line, go to wikipedia.<br />Like most have said, the pace and setup was excellent until Hanna pulls the locator switch, then it drags a bit.<br />Seeing Hanna as an involuntary 16-year old Jason Bourne character who is also coming-at-age was, to say the least, an interesting story line.<br /><br />If you keep several points in mind, you'll find the movie more creditable and enjoyable.  Her DNA was altered to eliminate compassion, pity, etc. and make her stronger with increased mental focus, so 90 lbs of Hanna Heller equals 1 grown up Jason Bourne.<br /><br />She kills in self defence, and I have to admit, while I cheered for her, knocking off CIA operatives who should be chasing down Al-Qaeda terrorists instead, had me conflicted.  But those CIA operatives were scum of the earth while the soldiers were pawns who would kill tribal leaders while hunting insurgents; it is after all, a rogue operation which is why Marissa hires Isaacs (\\"Why do you want me?\\"  Marissa: \\"The CIA won't let me do some things\\", or something like that).<br />Many viewers couldn't accept the \\"reason\\" for the 14-year hunt for Eric & Hanna Heller, but the same story line exists with 3 Jason Bourne movies so just believe that if the CIA wants you dead, they won't forget.  It is a bit weak as Marissa, 14 years ago, seems to be just a field assassin.  Marissa looks hot, and would probably bother a lot of male spymasters.<br /><br />Right after her escape from the CIA compound in the middle of the No. African desert (does Morocco know about it), Hanna comes in contact with everyday life and real people for the first time after leaving the Finland artic cocoon.  The Spanish boy will now learn not to grab girls inappropriately.  It also humanizes her for the audience, and you want her to win and thrive, I did, at least.<br />At the end, everybody dies but Hanna  . . . horray,but what becomes of her ?  bleeding from a bullet in her side, and \\"father\\" and grandmother also dead.  Where does she go, and who is going to mentor her towards emotional maturity.  I wanted a little more sugar, and I'll see if my 11-year old daughter can get some Hanna training before the boys arrive.
B007HACDLK|4|This is a good story that makes great airplane reading. I didn't find it as gripping as some of Mr. Flynn's other novels, but a worthwhile read just the same.
B004HO6HWA|5|love him in almost all his movies this was no different
B00007G1ZC|5|This movie is amazing! I love how the scenery changes with the mood, while most directors just change the lighting and background music. Akira Kurosawa takes the art of movie making and takes it up to a whole other level of brilliance.
1936041111|5|I recommend it to high school students seeking to improve vocabulary for the SAT. If you can read this book from cover to cover without looking up a single word in dictionary, you will do quite well on the verbal part of the SAT.<br /><br />By the way, story is pretty good too. Not the Hollywood version of \\"I have created a monster\\" thrill-ride but a close examination of how we ambitious humans tend to screw things up and in trying to fix it, we screw it up even more.<br /><br />Monster in the book is very eloquent and I got a big kick out of that.
B009ZZDNT6|5|Good app, simple to use, nice display does everything you need for an alarm clock.  I am using the free one, and don't see any need to pay to upgrade it.
B000AJIF4E|5|I found these to be comfortable with a flat even tone which is great for real to life sound. the cord is a nice length but a straight cable would be a nice open for these but not a deal breaker at all. the band is comfortable and I love how thin the cups are so they're not sticking out so far. My only concern is the wire that runs from the cup to the headband to the other cup, it's very thin and I'm scared it may pinch on something or break easily but no problems as of yet so all is good.
B000ZNRBK4|5|This lens hood reduces the number of stray rays and doesn't show up in my pictures.  Can't ask for more than that.
B00F87ZUYG|5|I plan on continuing to purchase the shows as I don't have cable but don't watch much tv anyway. This way I keep costs down by purchasing only shows I enjoy.
B000GM0KEI|5|Although it was &#34;used&#34; the book was in great condition.  Whether or not I ever use the recipes is another matter, but I'm glad I have this classic
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Once again John Grisham delivers a trial story that is full of twists and turns that keeps you reading until all hours of the night just to see how this will end.  I can't wait for the movie.
B000020617|5|This is a great album. Each soing feels like a rock instrumental because every song has a guitars that you feel that are lyrics and the guitar is Dave Grohl's voice. But because of that, the album is made for the better.  I reccomend this to any fan of rock or just guitars!
B005D9MUWY|5|Will never use stock Keyboard again
B009NFHF0Q|5|If you are a fan of Gaiman you will love it.  It is a quick read and very reminiscent of Coraline.
B005LAIIQC|5|He loves it and the price better than department stores!
B00KA7JIII|5|Pretty quick, but nice graphics and engaging gameplay. Good puzzles.
B000LXQVA4|5|Our grandson loves his jumperoo!!!! And so do our kids, they can actually get things done while he is having a blast! He bounces for hours at a time. I highly reccomend this item.
B004HD61KE|4|Lots of action and mystery presented in a way that makes you wonder what is truth and what us fiction.<br /><br />Captivating
B004KPX4W2|5|Brilliant performance by an outstanding cast, solving crime<br />and upholding justice despite the CIA's best efforts. Words<br />fly like bullets.
B00FAX6XQC|4|This game is pretty sweet bro
B005DOL0R0|2|Needed something to keep my Kindle safe and also wanted one to give as a gift .price wasn't. Bad either.
B00005JPRF|5|This was an awesome movie.  It moved a little fast, but otherwise, it's great.  I really enjoyed imagining the apocalypse themes and being part of the story.  Iain Glen made it all worth while, as he always does.  This was a splendid film, but should have been longer, not so rushed.  I enjoyed it, and saw it more than once.  It was fantastic and brilliant.  I love the story!  The book is good, too.  I love the Resident Evil series.   Really wonderful Extinction movie!  Worth buying on DVD!
B000W91RUG|5|First sitcom on the 3 networks that I've watched since the beginning days of Fraser and am hooked; I never miss an episode.
B00005R87Q|5|I don't know what I was expecting, but I know that what I got was a lot more than I had anticipated. I remember seeing the preview and thinking I'd MAYBE rent it, because it just looked like a cookie-cutter action movie, with low-rent talent. I now wish I had taken the opportunity to see this on the big screen.<BR>What a pleasant surprise of a movie! There was a pretty good story to it, with a few nice little twists to keep your mind occupied. I can't talk too much about the storyline without giving away the twists, but definately has more to offer than just car racing and women. I am someone who needs a good storyline to go with my action, or I get bored. I was NEVER bored watching this film. <BR>One of the reasons I avoided this film was because of the actors in it. JA Rule? Vin Diesel? And quite a few actors that I had never seen, nor did I care to. Going into it, I thought the highlight would be Michelle Rodriguez, who is one of the best young acresses around (see Girlfight for proof). Were there bad performances? A few, yes. But not out of the actors that I was trying to avoid. Alright, JA Rule was nothing special - but he wasn't in the film long enough to matter. Vin Diesel though gave a pretty good performance, and Paul Walker did a very nice job as well. Both of Paul Walker's bosses gave pretty cheesy performances, but you don't see too much of them anyways. <BR>The action in the film is top notch, and the film just looks great. On top of the great film, you do get some great bonuses with the DVD. I rented this, and flipped through the extras.... THREE PAGES, and not much fluff material here! I only had a chance to look at a few things, but what I saw was great! <BR>I highly recomend buying this movie immediately... and that is coming from someone who a week ago had no desire to even see it!
B005F96URI|3|This movie began its journey slowly, making it through production but having a time of getting distribution. When it finally did, the anticipation was high. It looked so good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the execution couldn't entirely live up to the anticipation. I won't say this is a bad movie. It was entertaining, had some nice lines and okay fight sequences. The real appeal is in watching the execution of a very eclectic and risky style of filmmaking. In attempting to pay homage while also reinterpreting the artistic and narrative style of bunraku puppetry, the filmmaker created an ambitious project. I've read complaints from viewers about the sparse, flat backgrounds of this film. I thought, given the style they attempt to emulate, they were wonderful. The pop-up book approach to transitions was executed with grace. The color palate of the film, while a bit too dichotomous for my tastes, is sharp and functional as it represents the two opposing forces (oppression and rebellion) and opposing styles of the main characters (old west and samurai).<br /><br />While the inconsistent nods to classic American musical cinema puts some people off, I found it entertaining. I don't feel it was used in sufficient amounts though. It needed to be played up more, like Kung Fu Hustle, or down into a subtle nuance of Killer #2's fighting style. As it stands, it feels uneven, most likely due to its uneven application throught the film. It is either in your face or not there at all.<br /><br />I enjoyed the acting, simplistic as it was. I don't believe that Josh Hartnett's approach to the cowboy needed a dynamic drama to him, nor did Ron Perlman's Woodcutter. I will say, however, that Woodcutter had my favorite scene in the film when he philosophizes about the need for a costume with Killer #2. The only character I felt was superfluous to the film was Demi Moore's whore, whose connection to the other characters felt forced in an effort to make THEM, not HER, feel like a more complete character.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about this movie is the pacing. It starts off quickly, slows down a lot, take a long time to tell you what you really need to know, then speeds up again at the very end. In the middle, there are moments where it feels like it is moving, but it isn't. I spent more time than I like glaring at my BD-player's counter and wondering why it wasn't further along in the film. This pacing problem needed to be solved in two ways, streamlining the script and editing the film.<br /><br />Overall, the film doesn't come across as amateurish or mundane, but neither does it approach the sublime art/action film many of us had hoped it would be. The filmmaker, Guy Moshe, is new to the game and his status as neophyte is obvious. However, one could also see his shortcomings as momentary setbacks in what could be a great career. After all, how many novice filmmakers come up with an idea this ambitious or execute it with such style?<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone who loves experimentation in filmmaking. This experiment is not a total failure, nor is it a complete success. Some people will like it more than others. It certainly seems to polarize reviewers on other websites. This is definitely a film that I would say you need to see on your own, regardless of your tastes. There are a ton of reviews but don't let them dictate your decision to view this film. Make your own judgement.
0307474712|5|Having just finished the book, I came on to see what others thought about it.  I was quite surprised to see how much was given away in people's descriptions.  I enjoyed the fact that the book didn't always go the way I thought it would, even early on or in the middle.  If you appreciate that aspect of a story, I recommend steering clear of the details of most reviews.  If I hadn't, some parts of the narrative would have had much lesser of an impact.    Ultimately, I found this book to a realistic one that described the ups and downs and ins and outs of a relationship very well.  The dialog felt real as did how the characters interacted with one another.  The author also had a great flair for descriptions throughout.  And finally, once you got used to the structure (after 3 or 4 chapters), you could see how Nicholls cleverly took advantage of his unique approach and enhanced his storytelling with it.    Two more notes -- this was very British, using locations and words and comments on accents that would only make full sense to natives.  Still, me being an American, I don't think I missed anything significant.  I got the gist.  The other note is that some have described this as \\"Chick Lit\\" and it appears to have been marketed as such.  My take on it though is that it rises above what one stereotypically thinks of as Chick Lit.  It feels like an intelligent, well-written book.
B0066WJLU6|5|This app illuminates a large area.  Actually, I downloaded it as a widget so it is readily available when I need a light source.  I highly recommend it for anyone who needs to find their way in a darkened arena, e.g., the Hollywood Bowl, or find a dropped item in a movie theater, etc.
B005LAIIRQ|3|Good story of survival, though the wolves are a bit far fetched in appearance.
0316172324|1|I've never seen a more transparent effort to cash in.  This is a (really) dumbed down psych lite book about nothing.  At times, Gladwell's effort to make a strong point in confusing (I suspect there is no point).  At other times, he provides mini-overviews of the examples discussed in the book in case we couldn't remember them...There is nothing interesting and nothing to gain from Gladwell's flimsy theory about \\"thinking without thinking.\\"  If you're interested in the thesis \\"the power of thinking without thinking is so strong unless it's a situation where regular thinking is required,\\"  buy the book.  Because that's all there is to it.
B000JK8OYU|5|Excellent sound quality and material. An album 100% recommended.  An album that should be present in every home. Very good
B000XUBFE2|5|In the book thief I wen  through a series of emotions<br />But nothing adds  up to the sadness I dealt after molching was bombed or when Leisel was reunited with max. This book is truly amazing.
B004U7JYXS|5|Great price for item.
B007MNV5WU|4|only 2 level sets.  it was nice with gravity and all but small amount of. content. there are bosses though so its ok. &asymp;)
B000XUBFE2|4|Really sad and the death person really confused me in the beginning.  Also Max was left hanging as far as I am concerned.<br />Other than that I thought it was well written, just too sad.
B007IXWKUK|3|not the best story writing and starting skipping thru...
B006LSZECO|5|Gone girl was a different book. Very good with lots of twists. The ending is a real twist, held your interest the whole time.
0439023513|5|Awesome Book!
B00AB7HESI|5|Always is just agh awsome :-) !!!!!!!!!
B007GCY8FS|3|There were far too many people involved and too many new locations to be realistic. He is a great x military man but not that great. It was rather long and he is not a super man all the time
0446310786|5|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a panoramic novel; it's about all the different kinds of people that inhabit the \\"Old South\\". The protagonist is Scout Finch, the motherless tomboy, daughter of a small-town lawyer. Their neighbors are all independently wealthy spinsters, except for a man named Radley, who lives with his mentally-ill brother Arthur (known as \\"Boo\\") who we never see. Then there are the \\"poor\\" people of the South; an honest dirt farmer named Cunnigham, and a notoriously filthy cracker named Ewell. Early in the story, Atticus Finch informs his daughter that the Cunninghams are poor, but repectable. The Ewells, however, have disgusting habits, and he warns her to stay away from them.    In some ways, To Kill a Mockngbird is a cautionary tale. Scout learns that friends, family, and neighbors can't always be trusted, and you can't \\"judge the book by the cover\\" when dealing with the people close to you. Take for instance the Cunninghams; the father may be \\"honest and respectable\\", yet he keeps his son out of school to work on the farm. Though Bill Cunningham believes in hard work, he doesn't believe in education, and his son will most likely end up illiterate. Another flaw of the Cunninghams is that they are easily swayed by conservative (and racist) whites who try to lynch a prisoner. Scout foils the lynching, but I won't reveal how.    If you're not American, but you want to understand who we are and how we got this way, then you need this book. If you're looking to become a US citizen, read this book. If you're studying American habits, this book will reveal everything.
0793927501|4|Anthony Hopkins, & Alec Baldwin, star in \\"The Edge\\" I can't beleive that they really used Bart thr bear for a real live Kodiak bear!! The story is about Charles (Anthony Hopkins) & Bob (Alec Baldwin) crashes a plane in the Alaskin Wildness & lose two men. And they have to survive by hiding from the bear and find food and make warm close. You should watch this movie
6304044836|5|A wonderful performance by all. Ford is so charming as he bumbles his way into Ormonds heart.(and the viewers). The original has always been my favorite movie, but this remake outshines.  I have both in my collection  and find them both charming and enjoyable. It just makes you feel good.
B00P7PBD2C|5|Really enjoyed this one
0316010669|1|The main reason I bought this book was because of the promise of teaching you how to improve upon utilizing your gut instinct.  As I progressed through the book, my gut instict was telling me that wasn't going to happen, and it was right. It was just a series of studies and examples of where instinct has worked and where it hasn't.  I didn't read one paragraph where the author instructs on how to improve upon or develop your unconscious decision-making.  The stories are interesting but the book was a big disappointment to me.
0375851569|5|I got this for my 6-year-old's birthday. We read them nearly every night, they are the favorites! It arrived looking perfect, brand new. Very good quality, exactly what you would expect in a store. Very pleased with this purchase.
0525478817|5|My son and I loved this book.  It is a unique read, a great love story, pulls at the heart strings while staying so grounded and realistic.  I recommend this book to teens and adults.  We are anticipating the movie.
B002BSHWUU|5|This was a gift for someone on Christmas.<br /><br />The description was just what I got. The package box is really nice, everything neatly organize and easy to put everything back.<br />All of the CD's are in perfect conditions, no scratches or skipping of any track.<br /><br />Everything arrived on time. Very satisfied.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Keeps me entertained!
B001UTW7QU|5|Having made it through all of Lost & onto Fringe.  The story line is definitely more coherent than Lost.  Some of Sawyer's humor occasionally shows up in Peter it seems.  Walter, often eating during an autopsy, is delightful.  Agent Dunham and Astrid (astro, asterix...) are perfect.  If you like Once Upon a Time and Lost, chances are you'll like this too.
B00T3DNKIE|4|I enjoyed the first half much better than the second half, but that is just a personal preference. Excellent writing. Worth the read and worth waiting for
B004SIP8JI|5|Love Hugh Jackman and the character he played in the film. Good chemistry with Meg Ryan. I always enjoy time travel films and this one hits the mark.
B00DHKKN6Q|4|I bought this game hoping it would be good for kids ages 5 - 10. It is. And it's also a bit of good fun for adults. Perfect for when I want to relax.
B00D7C8NFW|5|Took these on a Kayak trip and loved them!
B00070Q8DQ|4|It's been awhile since their last CD, but make no mistake, these guys are still setting the bar for brutal death metal for the next generation. The sound these guys give are like Morbid Angel on steroids, and they have some good songwriting with lots of tempo changes. Yah, they're mostly fast and pummelling, but they have enough variety to pull in metalheads who aren't this extreme.  <br /> <br />I don't know what it is about the sound of the drums, but it really does feel like an earthquake...like hell is opening up right in front of you.  <br /> <br />Good stuff - if you're into extreme metal, this is a necessity. <br /> <br />
B003TSEEDY|5|Really took me back to high school! Uniquely written to get inside the main characters head. Good read!
B003JLA4KS|5|The people I bought this for were thrilled and loved watching it.  They had watched it on VH-1 and it was a must for their collection.  I have to admit not being hard rock fan; I was impressed with Rush members' lives.  This is a perfect gift for a RUSH fan.
0439023483|5|The description for this book is short but it gets right to the point. I found it intriguing which is what made me decide to give this book a try in the first place. I must say that this is one of the more enjoyable books I've read in a while. I've read other complaints that the book doesn't go in depth enough about the world outside of the games through the eyes of those watching (especially Kat's family) and I agree that I would have liked to have seen more. However, unlike the other reviewers I don't think this took away from the story. I would like to have had more detail only because I didn't want the book to end. I thoroughly enjoyed the weaving of the story that the book could have been twice as long and I would have wanted more. To me, this is the sign of a well told story. I found myself buying into the characters, sympathizing for some and hating others.<br /><br />When my wife read the book she couldn't put it down. She had to go out to run some errands and couldn't wait to get back home in order to continue reading the book.
B00009R6H2|1|I feel really bad that mislead buyers. in the picture are two and comes one in the package. I am not satisfied with the purchase
B003XF1XOQ|4|If you are a hunger games fan, this is the last book (and my not my favorite, but still enjoyed it).
B00SI7GDBM|5|This movie is sooo beautiful! I love the journey it takes you on. I'm not surprised some people don't like this, because it's space themed, and most Americans don't care or know enough about space to find it fascinating (not saying everyone). Quite frankly I think this went over so many people's head. I would watch the movie and judge it for yourself.<br /><br />I saw this in theatres, and it blew my mind. So a smaller screen may take away from the experience of the journey.
B00AREIAI8|5|Amazing graphics and realistic movement.  Also realistic cost lol.  I am one of the real horse poor and this gives you s true idea of the expense involved.
B002V9PEU4|5|Mammoth sound, perfict picture. Exactly what I expected. I had the LD. and that format was impressive it was even better then the DVD. But the BluRay has them all beat.
0062238868|5|I ordered this book before Kyle's most untimely death.  A great person and sad what happened.  My husband being interested in military was not disappointed and was impressed though his first reaction before the book was that Kyle was stuck on himself and his ability--he went away from reading the book impressed what a great man he was.  Hightly recommentds reading his autobiography.
B00TF7KZ54|5|Another Spielberg masterpiece! This film is about the events that followed the assassination of the Israeli athletes by the Palestinians during the Munich Olympic Games in 1972. Spielberg traces the assassins hired by the Israeli government to kill the men involved. This group of men are chosen to travel to different parts of Europe to complete their mission on behalf of their country. Some men lose sleep, some men lose their minds, some men lose their lives others lose nothing and some lose their soul. Was it all worth it? Spielberg reflects on these questions and the effects it has on the hired assassins, with palpable images and effective sound manipulation reminiscent of Hitchcock and some segments that emanate Altman’s signature voyeuristic camera work in this remarkable study of revenge and the effects it has on our humanity and beliefs.
B000AU9UYM|5|Batman Begins is exactly what Batman should be. Realistic, gritty, and the story of how a man decides to dedicate his entire being to stop from happening to others what once happened to him. I applaud the choice of Nolan to use Ra's as the villain, instead of just going with the usual Penguin or Catwoman or something that could easily be done. Ra's is Batman's greatest foe, and was done great justice in this film.<br /><br />I choose this film over The Dark Knight for one reason, really. The Dark Knight was a little TOO realistic. Batman is a comic book character, after all, and Gotham city is a fictional city, filled with fantastic villains as well as the normal real life problems that plague everyone else. In Batman Begins, the city of Gotham feels like it could be a real city, but it also gives you a view of twisted places like The Narrows that remind you of the fantastical portion of the story. The Dark Knight, on the other hand, just looks like it takes place in Chicago. I didn't get that fantasy feeling from it at all. I guess it is more just a personal preference, but I feel like Batman Begins had the perfect balance of reality and fantasy, without catering to either one more than it should.<br /><br />Both Nolan Batman movies are exactly what Batman should be, but I just feel that this one got it MORE right the first time.
B00V4JJFN4|1|CG was really heavy-handed and not very well done (I had an uncanny valley reaction to some of the dwarfs). Very little character development. Pacing was very jumpy. Just not good.
B009UX2YAC|5|It was fun but the deals are stupid. The new York one was better than the Rio one. Hope you  agree.
B002QE3CTY|5|Absolutely wonderful. I was so into this book I got caught reading it at work. I can't wait to see the movie!
B00I8H6X58|4|Hands down, McConaughey's best work to date.  Shows his full range of talents in this over.  Based on the true &#34;buyers clubs&#34; of the early AIDS era that put non-fda approved drugs into the hands of the sick.  Both a powerful and informative  movie.
B00FN2KR2G|4|An easy to read story with a few twists and turns thrown in.
B007IXWL2C|1|Wanted to go trough the trigoly event though the second book was dissappointing.<br />The books started with a good idea,  a different perspective on romance. But it failed so badly.<br />It is just a incredible amount of sterotypes, stupid dialogues and in the end failed to offer a new vision of modern relationships. Impossible to escape a prologue of &#34;happily ever after&#34;, where the girl finally gets her wish of a big wedding, two kids and a rich prince charming who along the way realizes that she is the one who will save him from his shallow existence. Pathetic... I am aways amazed that it seems there's only one role model for women. Find a rich husband, get married and breed. Everything in between seems irrevelant. Impossible to be a woman in charge of her own sexuality, exploring new possibilities in a less conventional relationship and having FUN. Well, II guess I'll keep searching ...
B00EMXBDMA|5|A marvelous story line with humor and intensity.  A friend of mine and I discovered we'd both read this book and loved it - the first time in 20 years!  I look forward to reading more from Mr. Weir.  He puts a great story together that is credible and fun to read.

B006PFC2S2|4|I thought the film quality was good and I love the movie.<br />This is a heartwarming and very romantics story
B00HYTT7BI|1|I did not even make it to the water. Captain Philip was still on LAND when I became so nauseated and headachy that I could not continue. The shaky camera techniques that start from the first second of the movie were enough to ruin it for me. I hope and pray that this era of &#34;gritty realism&#34; ends soon and directors come to the realization that the shaky cam should be used in small doses for effect - - NOT A TWO HOUR MOVIE!!!!!

B009XIXVU6|5|Khalid Hosseini writes a story that compels the reader to keep reading, following to the end. The end makes you wish it could have gone on longer. As in his other books, the story takes place in the Middle East, but also expands to the US. Khaled manages to bring together both cultures in such a way that it is easier to understand each other. In this case of &#34;and the Mountains Echoed,&#34; he also introduces a little bit of France to stir the pot a little. I tried to read this novel a little at a time to savor the tale, but in the end, I could no longer hold back and raced to the conclusion. separation during childhood, separation through dementia and stroke: there are many ways to be separated from our loved ones.

1909976172|5|SIR HENRY BROOKE IS RIGHT!<br />“THERE IS STILL AN ABSENCE OF ANY REALLY COHERENT UP-TO-DATE THINKING WITHIN GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF PENAL POLICY”<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The case for a Royal Commission on the Penal System is a strong call which will, eventually, be agreed…one day in the future.<br /><br />That matter is about all that can be conceded at the moment even though the Commission would be both cost effective to the community and would return some confidence to the public in the way in which criminal justice is currently managed by the politicians. Most are also agreed however on the need for such an initiative now and that it is a matter of growing urgency.  The question is always… and when will it happen as the numbers in custody continue to rise as our population expands.<br /><br />A clear case has been set out in this excellent short pamphlet by Louis Blom-Cooper and Sean McConville at Waterside Press suggesting a re-examination of main aspects of the UK’s view of penal policy in 21st century by this current call to action!<br /><br />So what are the obstacles?  They remain those difficult questions which political columnist and ex Tory MP Matthew Parris succinctly listed in “The Times” when describing penal policy as a taboo subject. Parris (and others) say of prisons: “They don’t work”! We know that so what are we going to do about it?<br /><br />That of itself should be quite a clear and sufficient statement for something constructive to be done. Few observers probably disagree with a view that some new thinking should be employed because of the reconviction rates and a general lack of successful rehabilitation in applied criminology.<br /><br />In the form of bullet points, Parris goes on to say and we quote:<br /><br />• Nearly half of those imprisoned are reconvicted within a year of release<br />• We don’t re-educate or train properly<br />• Drugs get in routinely and by mysterious means<br />• Suicides and assaults are rife<br />• Many prisoners are mentally ill<br />• Conditions in over-stretched jails approach solitary confinement, yet every wretched prisoner costs £36,000 a year<br />• Each next inspection does its best to outdo each last in ransacking the lexicon of shock and indignation; each is relegated<br />• Everybody shrugs their shoulders, attention wanders and the disgrace continues<br />• Our descendants will gasp in horror at our disregard.<br /><br />So why don’t we talk about this?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the answer to all these problems can be summed up with one word- disinterest.<br /><br />The current proactive supporters for a Commission make the case that, as a model, it should be reflective, effective and swift, capable of building consensus, and of providing directions for a generation.<br /><br />That these points are agreed is not really in dispute because the criminological landscape has changed so much in recent years and society needs to catch up.  It would not be that expensive for a government to set up and report on penal reform if the terms of reference are carefully structured.  So it is really about political will, and current lack of it with all the annual tinkering with criminal justice legislation by MPs, most of whom are no longer representatives with real life experience, just those with more special “adviserships”.<br /><br />However, all this is not enough because it is accepted that there is neither the requisite political will (at the moment), nor the probable necessity of public support whilst we enter a long drawn-out general election campaign for 7th May 2015.<br /><br />It is estimated that about 2% of the media’s attention or interest will be lavished on legal/penal policy as the election issues unfold.  So it is not the top of the agenda.  The issues though remain such as how much should be spent on the penal system.<br /><br />Also there is a need to set a new reshaping agenda for successive generations to adopt where an objective view of sentencing can be achieved. The view could come from an evidence based report which will have both a practical meaning and effect for a more mature society vision of how this country deals with its criminals in future years.<br /><br />We wish we could be more positive about this call to action. That fact that it has been made is a first step which will, if taken forward, be of substantial long term benefit for society and offenders. Many feel rightly that some new thinking is needed to engage the new five year government but this could be a pipe dream.<br /><br />However, there is a grave danger that the seeds of this idea robustly set out in the pamphlet remain scattered on purely stony ground as the call is refused… at least for the time being anyway. There is always hope that with a fresh team there is a fresh hope for reform.m.<br /><br />Also there is a need to set a new reshaping agenda for successive generations to adopt where an objective view of sentencing can be achieved.

0385504209|3|Overall, I found this book to be extremely cheesy. But there were interesting ideas. The times set aside for holidays were chosen based on existing pagan holidays. Romanesque churches still standing today are believed by some scholars to be the work of rural pagan craftsmen who put sly references to their belief of male/female equality and such.<br />Oh! And this document concerning PS leadership includes French film maker Jean Cocteau.
0553801473|5|i loved it.  i loved every page, i have read all 5 books and i was sorry to get to the last page of this one.  i'm not looking forward to the long wait before the next one and i'm sorry to read that george plans to stop at 7!  i don't understand any of the negative reviews for this book - ok, it doesn't move as swiftly as the first three books, but the complexity of it all is a marvel.  grrm remembers all of his characters, dead and alive, even down to the cats.  whereas the last book, which i still liked, concluded with a wtf???  this book wrapped up marvelously, resolved many of the loose ends from the last book, and left many exciting possibilities for the next installment.  5/5
B00HZ3C4N6|5|Loved it!!  Nice background to Jack Ryan's evolution as a cia operative.
B00957T6X6|3|[...]I was totally entralled with the telling of the tale. But then the fifth and final book was written and I suppose Mr. Martin just tired of writing.  He could have just ended the fourth book with \\"and everyone dies and the world keeps on going.\\"  disappointing.

B000FA675C|4|Dan Brown is an interesting writer.<br /><br />When I was younger (and hadn't tried to write much myself) I didn't like him. After trying my hand at it, I think I've changed my mind.<br /><br />He does use some cheap tricks - for example - an albino evildoer. But I use my own cheap tricks, so that's that.<br /><br />The professor protagonist is also a bit gimmicky, though it clearly does serve its purpose of getting the reader up to speed on focused knowledge that might be difficult to convey otherwise.<br /><br />Brown has done his research and it shows. That's one of the things that makes the book a rewarding read even where its execution doesn't sit 100% with me.<br /><br />I do wonder if you couldn't distill the knowledge here and in the Lost Symbol and have a more complex story - where the characters interpret the \\"clues\\" less literally. Sometimes (okay - often) the literalness and the lack of ambiguity in the characters interpretation of the clues/adventure they've set out on makes me feel like it is a Scooby-Doo episode.<br /><br />Also - both the Da Vinci Code & The Lost Symbol, feel to me as if the protagonist Langdon has actually missed the point entirely and only claps at fool's gold by the novel's close . . . maybe that's just me? I don't know . . .<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT -- For example - it seemed to me that the obvious conclusion would be that Sophie is the living grail, and Langdon doesn't really get there.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder if that's Brown's intent? Hiding mystical knowledge in plain view, in a popular format . . .<br /><br />If that's the case, then he's a genius!<br /><br />Either way, despite stylistic complaints aside, the book is a page turner. I can't deny that!

B00J0MUGZS|4|A great follow-up to a so-so start (don't get me wrong, the first one was good, but it was almost all set-up, which is important, but it made it just ... so-so).

030758836X|2|I never comment on the books Inread, but I had to on this one. It starts out as a great book. A definite page turner that is different than others on the market. However, the ending is so bad it ruins the whole book. It doesn't even make sense with the way to characters are built up. It's like all of a sudden she decided it was enough pages so she would tie it up in 5 pages or less.

B005DD7MH8|4|An aspiring writer Eddie Morra/Bradley Cooper whose life is a mess, gets turned onto a new pill, NZT-48 by his ex-girlfriend's brother. The NZT allows Eddie o focus intently and reach his maximum potential. In days he's able to master the stock market, finish his novel and impress the hell out of his publisher and basically turn his life around....UNTIL he finds the dark side of NZT.<br /><br />He finds himself pursued by a Russian mob loan shark, and an unscrupulous stock manipulator (Robert DeNiro) amidst the realization that all those who've previously taken NZT are dead or very ill. Fascinating storyline, memorable characters and a good flow to the story made this movie highly enjoyable to me.

There are numerous memorable scenes involving a protagonist that you like and want to root for as he faces considerable, sometimes seemingly insurmountable challenges. I read the Kindle version in four or five sittings and felt like the action made the pages turn themselves. All in all, an enjoyable thrill ride for this reader!
B00HWWUR1Q|5|Peter Jackson is the most suited director for the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit series movies. The story lines are not exactly like the books but do them Justice. I love watching movies in 3D and the effects a wonderful in the Hobbit. I can hardly wait for the final Hobbit in July.
B0001HAHXW|2|With all the hoolpa this cd has received, one is atonsihed by the absolute nonsense of some of the rock critics who rave about this.  Much of this collection of performances of songs that Robert Johnson recorded is on the level of a bar band doing Robert Johnson. None of Clapton's renditions of these songs match those by Robert Lockwood, Johnny Shines, Honeyboy Edwards, Big Joe Williams, Junior Wells, Eddie Taylor, Boyd Gilmore, Muddy Waters and others who have taken Johnson's songs and produced recordings that are more passionately and personally performed.  Clapton is too reverent to these songs and the lyrics which is strange for a homage to Johnson whose own work adapted and transformed his contemporaries music as Elijah Wald details in his recent book. Check out Leroy Carr's In the Evening before listening to Robert Johnson's Love in Vain and Clapton's rendition pales compared to the Stones' cover of it three decades ago.  Both Junior Wells and Eddie Taylor had standout recordings of Stop Breakin' Down that makes Clapton's rendition here sound not very distinguished.  Call Clapton a rock guitar god all you want and a great popularizer of the blues, but when you have assimilated not simply Johnson's music but also the great bluesmen of the past fifty years, than Clapton's achievement is clearly overstated.   One other point was that I was not enamored by the studio band. There are some great players (and Mr. Portnoy is a great harp player), but the rhythm section does not swing and they sound second rate comapred to some of the classic Chicago bands of the sixties and seventies.
B0000025F7|5|JOURNEY TO THE PAST: The year is the summer of '79 &amp; this is Michael Jackson's effort (aside from The Jacksons) as a full-grown, mature 21-year old.This is a record where you are able to listen to all of the songs without getting sick of them! The King of Pop still is one of the greatest singers/inspirations of our time. It should be essential in every music lover's collection...whether you like Mike or not. Buy this before it becomes hard to find! End of discussion.

Sam Elliot is a strong presence for both the boy as well as for his mother, who needs to overcome her drug habit in order to appreciate her son for who he is..as time is short in his world. A tear jerker, I cried for about 10 minutes after the film was over.

Also, not just a hidden object puzzle but other kinds are integrated as well (block puzzle, memory puzzle, etc.).  Truly enjoy this game.

0783225903|5|Produced in 1985, \\"Brazil\\" is a black (and bleak) comedy about a future gone eerily awry.  A future that, since this is 2002, is already coming true around us.  Terry Gilliam's brilliant, colorfully retro vision of the future has little in common with the styling of Orwell's \\"1984,\\" but deep inside the message is the nearly the same.  The only real difference is that, unlike Orwell, Gilliam believes that the one fragile hope is the durability of the human imagination.<br />The opening scenes of the film reveal a manic world, where a bug (literally) in the works triggers the spectacular arrest of one Archibald Buttle, whose off-screen death under interrogation triggers a flurry of clerical paperwork.  The world we see is fascinating, full of automation nearly gone berserk and the hapless human machinery that fills in the gaps.  In this world, one may not only face hard interrogation, but be billed for that service as well.  When Buttle, mistaken for terrorist Harry Tuttle, suffers a heart attack under questioning, Information Retrieval issues a refund.  However, his wife's lack of a bank account triggers a series of complications.  Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), a daydreaming bureaucrat in the Ministry of Information, takes up the task of resolving the situation by hand delivering the check.<br />Harry faces many delightfully comic situations on his quest, as machinery refuses to function for him and the people in his world seem to treat him as something not quite socially acceptable.  But all of this is brought up sharply when he finally confronts the widow.  \\"My husband's dead, is he,\\" she cries, \\"What have you done with his body?\\"  Suddenly we are confronted with the truth.  The surface is only a surface.  As in \\"The Matrix,\\" once you are past it something horrific looms.  \\"Brazil\\" will continue to play this theme throughout.  Walls conceal semi-organic, hostile masses of tubes and ductwork, room dividers separate upper-class diners from the gory reality of a terrorist bombing.  Masses of plastic surgery cover the flaws of aging beauty.<br />It is no surprise that Harry falls victim to his own daydreams.  Looking up through a hole in Mrs. Buttle's ceiling Lowry spies the face of the woman of his dreams, Jill the truck driver, played wonderfully by Kim Geist.  In his desperate attempts to track her down, Sam transfers into the dark world of Information Retrieval.  There, aided my his friend Jack Lint (Michael Palin), he finds out what he needs, but inadvertently sets in motion a series of events that can only be describes as a burlesque apocalypse.  Layer after layer of his society's illusions collapse around him and Jill with humorous, but nightmarish precision.<br />Terry Gilliam has proven himself a genius at using dark humor and sarcasm to engage in a plot that would be horribly difficult otherwise.  As in \\"The Fisher King,\\" we laugh and snicker right up until we confront the truth.  \\"Brazil\\" is a brilliant example of this.  Full of the imaginative imagery of a retro-future world and great acting by a cast that includes the likes of Robert De Niro and Katherine Helmond it is an experience that stuns the sensibilities while bringing home its message.  In his notes, Gilliam calls this a light-hearted nightmare.  One will haunt you for some time to come.st bombing.

0684857219|5|This book was recommended to me for YEARS before I bought it, what a loss of opportunity! This book has reshaped how I weight train all together. It has made me more competent and efficient in just about every area of exercising. I am not a bodybuilder and can tell you that as an everyday 40 year old guy who enjoys weight training this book will make you more effective and offer better and safer results than watching other people at the gym or on youtube videos ever will. It truly is a MUST HAVE for anyone seeking to take their weight training to the next level, or just want to know that you are doing exercises effectively and safely.

B00GIXWXEO|5|I wasn't sure about this little movie. My kids didn't seem interested when they saw the preview at the theater. Then yesterday they were bored and we saw it was available. I showed them the preview and they said ok let's try it. Well I am so glad they did. They sat quietly and watched the whole thing. At ages 4 and 7 sometimes it is hard to find a movie they both like. One is a boy the other a girl, so that makes things even more difficult. This one is good for both boys and girls, and held both of their interest. Good news is they are watching it again today. That means I truly got my moneys worth.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Well developed characters and compelling storyline make this a suspenseful, heart wrenching and real novel. It is a good reminder of what we often forget: life is not black and white.
B002ZG975Q|4|The movie was really good but the ending was lacking. The ending in the book gave so much more depth and feeling. It was portrayed almost perfectly in the alternate ending (WATCH IT! It's in the bonus features) so I don't get why it was the alternate ending. I would recommend reading the book first because it explained a lot more and went more in depth than the movie. But over all the movie was really fantastic. (Neil Patrick Harris was really good!)

1451696191|2|This book had been given to be by a friend, and when I first received it I was very excited. However, as I began reading, I found the book was very hard to relate to, I am an honor student in the tenth grade, and I love reading. Being in high school and being older than the main character I found the events exaggerated and frankly they didn't peak my interest at all. This book is mainly about sex and drugs. I am sure many found this compelling, I however, was not able to find the subject interesting.
B007TBZ63Y|4|In Mark of Athena, Rick Riordan brings together the heroes of the previous two books of this series: Annabeth, Percy, Jason, Piper, Leo, Frank, Hazel and their war-crazed chaperone, Coach Hedge. They are off to save the world, again, and they have to try not to kill each other along the way. This book is full of what you expect from this series - witty comments, oddball monsters and lots of adventure. I think because there were a lot more main characters to juggle, this book didn't flow as well as previous ones, but still worth reading.

0399226907|5|We have read this to our kids, nieces and nephews for over 10 years. Great book for young children. Highly recommended.
B00AMBLDEE|4|But, it took half the movie to figure out what the heck was going on.  I couldn't figure out if the new character was good or bad or...
B0062NAX1U|5|This movie was so realistic. It was great to see men stand for their beliefs and their families backing them. I loved the declaration they wrote up and lived by. It was heart breaking for one man to tell on another, but it showed how dealing with a situation was important and right.
B0098VXCR0|4|Special effects were great....Charlize is terrific as usual...<br />Kristen Stewart is another Mathew Broderick...It's the same emotion no matter what role they play
B000007R1M|5|I'm going to keep it short and sweet.  The blackest whitemen alive.  I haven't seen too many urban music heads review this, except for the B-Boy but I think that the influence Kraftwerk had on urban music can never be overemphasized.  Drum Machines, metal and flesh, automatons, all of this was very P-Funk-esque for urban kids.  We were already accustomed to artist creating their own 'worlds' within the music for the listener to dive into.  Krafwerk did this with the quadruple blow of TTE, Man Machine, Computer World and Tour De France.  There is no smarter music than this stuff.  Go out and buy the quad shot you'll see the magic
B00004YKUY|5|Quienes haban dado ya por desaparecidos a Journey han de volver sobre sus palabras. Con un nuevo cantante (si no te lo dicen, piensas que es el mismsimo Steve Perry con unos aos menos y con su voz tan especial) y nuevos bros han hecho un lbum redondo. Desde la primera cancin a la ltima, todas nos recuerdan a los mejores Journey: baladas tiernas -en su lnea- y rocks frenticos.  No tengas dudas y cmpratelo ( o bjalo de la red si puedes). Han pasado muchos aos desde sus inicios, pero ellos suenan igual de bien que siempre y su nuevo cantante (un autntico clon de Perry) no defrauda lo ms mnimo. Creme!

B006VJMZXY|5|Who can foresee the future of all of us.  To live in fear of a women however power is destructive. A fascinating book and one lovers of history will thoroughly enjoy
B00N1JQ2UO|5|What a fun movie. Lots of adventure and humor. Nice DVD collection although I do not need a 3D copy. Never quite understood why manufacturers need to include all of the formats in one package. I just wanted the Blu-Ray. The rest just sits in the case.
B000002H2H|5|1. Fight Fire With Fire (4:44) 10/10 <br /> <br />Do not let the opening 41 seconds of acoustic intro deceive you, the opening track is one of the heaviest songs in Metallica's whole repertoire. As soon as the classic melodies fade, a set of the most menacing, vicious and ruthless riffs slams in your face and shows no mercy. Hetfield's harsh, monotone growls fit the music perfectly and immediately, Metallica exemplifies itself as a force of devastation that cannot be stopped. There is a decent solo section in the middle of the song from 2:34-3:22 that is also worth mentioning. But make no mistake, FFWF sets the stage for the rest of the album flawlessly and provides us a mere taste of what's yet to come.   <br /> <br />2. Ride The Lightning (6:36) 10/10 <br /> <br />The title track, which has Dave Mustaine written all over it throughout the entire span of 6 minutes and 36 seconds is one of the most underrated songs of all time. Again, just 12 seconds in, we are introduced with riffs so intense, it will cause every metal fan to spontaneously snap their necks upon a listen. Hetfield's shrieking vocals does a fantastic job at setting the atmosphere here, shown best by the infamous line \\"I DON'T WANT TO DIIEEE!\\" quickly accompanied by that fierce echo immediately following through. However, the highlight of the song is undisputedly the 1 minute and 33 seconds of furious guitar shredding from Mustaine. The solo commences at the 2:48 mark and gradually builds a cresendo of sonic immensity up until 3:42, when all hell suddenly breaks loose. The tempo then speeds up greatly and Mustaine pulls off some of the most jaw dropping guitar harmonies into the latter half of the solo.  <br /> <br />3. For Whom The Bell Tolls (5:10) 9/10 <br /> <br />Enter thunder and lightning. FWTBT has the longest intro of any track in the history of Metallica's discography. Nothing too fancy, but it does a great job setting the atmosphere and mood for the rest of the song. The vocals here are done incredibly well, arguably Hetfield's best performance on the record. There are also some short moments of intervals between the verses, allowing Ulrich to capitalize on a few drum rolls in order to satisfy his gluttonous ego. The outro seems to drag for a bit, but nevertheless, this is one of the band's most memorable songs and a favorite live.   <br /> <br />4. Fade To Black (6:56) 10/10 <br /> <br />Alas, Fade To Black, probably the best post-Mustaine Metallica song of all time. From start to finish, everything here just thrives. 20 years later, it's still hard to fathom how the band managed to have the classic acoustic notes accompanied so well with the smooth guitar melodies of Hammett in that intro. If you are not moved by the powerful vocals of Hetfield, you will be by the dark, genuine emotion of that main riff. However, the spotlight here is without a doubt on Hammett; for the solo in the instrumental outro would be the best piece of music he ever wrote. Despite what Metallica has sadly disintegrated to in the last few years, Fade To Black does and will always own you.  <br /> <br />5. Trapped Under Ice (4:03) 7/10 <br /> <br />Evidently, Side A of RTL is very near absolute perfection. However, unfortunately Side B will not quite live up to its predecessor. First track up is Trapped Under Ice, although not necessarily a bad song, it definitely pales when compared to the four previous classics. There are three sections of guitar shreds and a decent riff section at 2:00-2:25, but other than that, this is an average effort by Metallica. <br />  <br /> <br />6. Escape (4:23) 4/10 <br /> <br />Escape is a definite miss for the band. It is ultimately labeled as filler by most fans, and rightfully so. The structure is unorganized, with bits and pieces of ideas distributed poorly. The songwriting is disappointing. Not to mention the closing bridge is down right awful, especially crammed in with that horrendous siren. It does have a few reasonable left over riffs here and there but do \\"escape\\" this mediocrity with the skip button. <br /> <br />7. Creeping Death (6:36) 8/10 <br /> <br />Although being one of the most popular songs on the record, Creeping Death is probably also the most overrated. However, this is not a bad song by any means. The intro riff is an infectious hook, and Hammett gives a great minute solo at 2:48. The riff section following the solo is a good progression from the one on Trapped Under Ice. During the conclusion, there are some lovely guitar harmonies that really shine through.  <br /> <br />8. The Call of Ktulu (8:52) 9/10 <br /> <br />Don't let the writing credits mislead you. This entire instrumental is written by Mustaine, and features his patented Spider Chords that wonderfully progresses and evolves throughout the whole song. Following with yet another melodic intro, the song breaks out at 1:24 and screams of total guitar technique for the next 8 minutes. Around the 3:32 mark, a breathtaking solo is weaved into the chords and changes key several times. Then, just like the previous song, guitar harmonies are greatly emphasized during the end. The only problem with this track is that it does seem to drag on too long. There also seems to be more variations in the first 5 minutes than the latter 4, which will cause the listener to slightly lose interest. However, TCOK is a great way to conclude the album.  <br /> <br />Package 10/10 <br />Ride The Lightning without a doubt has the best cover art in the history of Metallica's career. Although very simple, the metaphor for the electric chair to the lightning is just pure genius. The cover alone is so immediately recognizable that even fans in mainstream music can distinguish it from just a glance. The band logo never looked better draped in white and blue with streaks of lightning branching out. This is one of the most memorable metal album covers of all time. <br /> <br />Production 10/10 <br />Along with the music, the production for Ride The Lightning is also eons ahead of its time. It unquestionably owns all other sophomoric releases from the \\"Big Four\\" of Thrash in terms of sound quality. The riffs are heavy, yet incredibly clear. The solos are crisp, and the drumming sounds fantastic. Hetfield's voice is an immense improvement from the raw raspy performance he gave on Kill Em All. An album with such solid production in 1984 is truly incredible. A re-master is really not even necessary. <br /> <br />Replayability 10/10 <br />Ride The Lightning is really the first thrash album to include melody from the classic guitar style mostly introduced by Burton. In addition to Dave Mustaine's influences aside from his brilliant guitar writing conveyed through the instrumental and the title track, this album has a lot of variety. Thus, the diversity between songs on top of the plethora of famous riffs and solos makes Ride The Lightning even more enjoyable.      <br /> <br />Content 10/10 <br />Metallica's second album really surprised the music world with their song writing talent and maturity at such an early period of time. The lyrical content reflects as much variety as the music. The opening track is about the nuclear holocaust. The title track is about one's feelings moments before execution on an electric chair. \\"Fade To Black\\" shows a different side of the band, expressing emotions for suicide. \\"Creeping Death\\" follows its predecessor \\"The Four Horsemen\\" from Kill Em All as another variation of a tale from the bible. For Whom The Bell Tolls has some of the best lyrics James Hetfield ever wrote. The content of Ride The Lightning is a definite pivotal part of this album's critical success. <br /> <br />Essentialness 10/10 <br />Although Master of Puppets is blindly hailed by most Metallica fans as their greatest album, the true metal fans tend to prefer Ride The Lightning. Both are extremely essential albums, and undoubtedly a wonderful gateway into the realm of heavy metal for new fans. This is one of the best Thrash albums of all time, although one of the earliest. Ride The Lightning enunciates the epitome of the glory days of Metallica, a time of direction and passion for music that today seems so very distant.    <br /> <br />90.0% <br />
B000HC2LI0|5|This box set was a perfect addition to my Aaron Sorkin collection.  The brief case design along with file folders makes it something you want to display, not just a container for DVDs.
B00QXKB7X0|1|I can't help but think Dan Reynolds wife (lead singer of Nico Vega) Yoko-Ono'd the hell out of this album.  It has all the same discord, goofy noises, sound effects, and general lack of melody or hook that Nico Vega has. That's not a good thing.  These attempts to be original or avant garde have  produced a hot mess. People are loving &#34;Bet My Life&#34; but the whole song seems like an excuse to get to the 'catchy' chorus and most of it sounds like it was recorded in a monkey enclosure at the zoo.  Some crazy woman yelping and squawking in the back like a chimp on meth (Yoko) is not very pleasant on the ears.  &#34;Shots&#34; is the only song that seems to come from the same band that made Night Visions and its just sorta meh. EVERY song has an overused stop-start-stop-start dynamic that is (I assume) supposed to build emotion or tension but it sounds like the band can't play for more than 30 seconds without needing a bit of a break. It gets very noticeable and grating after a few songs.  This felt very rushed and no one involved in the making of this album had the job of quality control. I-meh-gine Drags-on.
B00HDMMISA|5|Enjoyed this book immensely. Couldn't wait to get to the end. Fast and fun read.
B000001Y2U|5|combining industrial strength intensity with death metal riffing, sprinkled with a goth feel, marilyn manson gave us the monster album that caused quite a stir in its day and gave me christian right advocates protesting when i went to see it live.  <BR>     i think this album is spectacular in lieu of trent reznor's influence not because of.  sometimes using a drum machine, other times live drums give this album a great feel.  you can never tell if the music is the result of man or machine but you always the emotion is real.  <BR>     if the music had no substance, marilyn would not be around.  he would be dismissed as a goof but this album is truly the goods delivered.  marilyn brings us the carnival evil of his imagination.  the music is hard, heavy, fast and furious.  he is dark and angry and yet sad and sensitive at the same time.  <BR>     the chainsaw guitars buzz their way through your sanity as marilyn paints such a wonderfully weird and twisted world.  the throbbing bass coupled with the almost mechanical yet explosive drums truly inspire this monumental album.

B000FVQM2Y|3|Brick is a stylish modern day noir which uniquely uses high school students as its main stars (although students aren't exactly going to class that much). Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) begins his quest to discover the whys of his ex-girlfriend's death.  The film begins with him receiving a mysterious call from Emily, her stating that she is \\"in trouble.\\" Snooping around, and enlisting his friend Brain for clues, Brendan encounters some shady types around the high school as he gets closer to the darker truth of her end, and becomes involved in a dangerous drug world.   While I loved the attempt to make this a modern day noir, somehow it just didn't work that well. For one, although the rhythm of the dialogue is quick, face-paced, and snappy, it seems like the characters are just saying lines rather than really acting. They keep the mood of a hard-broiled noir intact, but the dialogue is devoid of any real meaning. Secondly, half the time you can't understand what the characters are saying. Even with subtitles, the lingo is just way too over the top and distracting (one reviewer said it best, sort of \\"hipster noir\\"....i.e. \\"I've got knives in my eyes.\\" translation: \\"I have a bad headache.\\")Even as homage to noir, the dialogue goes around in circles without really making any sense or having much power. Finally, it takes way too long for this story to get going, and the 110 minutes for the amount of \\"real story\\" is way too long. It was painstaking to wait for key plot events to surface, and mysteries to be unraveled. When it finally does get going with Brendan encountering various thugs and bad dudes , the story does get more interesting, but it need not take that long to get there.   I really liked the effort that Brick makes to be a fresh take on the noir film, but over all, it was just so-so.
B005KTZ05G|5|i was just amazed about everything when i first saw this figure. it has very nice detail and it will basically go into any pose you would like. When i got it though, the right hidden blade broke immediately. It was not a big deal i actually just put some super glue on it and now it is better than ever. I highly recomend this figure but i also recommend to put a lot of super glue on the skinny parts of both the hidden blades. in the long run it will just make having this figure more enjoyable.
B0053KWDES|4|Since I started using my first music portable device, a \\"walkman\\" (yes I'm old) I've always felt that you can not get enough sound from them, and I've owned a lot walkman, cd walkman, MiniDisc, Smartphones, iPods, etc...<br />I bought lately a set of Bose QC15 after years of not being able to listen properly to music in an flight, you always get aircraft background noise, plus the occasional child crying its lungs out. Wonderful, it worked!!! the headphones isolated the noise from the cabin plus presented richer sound, however I felt still I couldnt get the most of the music out the iPod.<br />Until lately i came across headphone amplifiers the FiiO product line and was reluctant to buy any because it meant to carry an extra device bundled with my iPod/iPhone. However, after some some reading of different reviews and considering that the price was worth the risk I got a E11 + the FiiO L9 line out cable, and boy how it has changed the listening experience.<br /><br />So far I have tested it with another pair of headphones I own (Seinheiser HD558) and the sound is crisp and with much detail, plus you can get more juice out of the iPod. I havent tested it yet with my QC15 in an flight but I guess its going to improve the experience also.<br /><br />One thing you need to take into account, this amplifier is suitable to work best only with high end \\"over the ear\\" Headphones, not with the normal earbuds or even thirdparty high-end \\"in-ear\\" headphones. This is because the experience that an \\"over the ear\\" headphone gives you is far better since it wraps the sound over your ears, and somehow creates a sound cage, at least thats my opinion.<br /><br />I didnt give it a full 5 star because the placement of the input/output jacks should be inverted in my opinion, also the volume knob even is very sturdy and balanced should be a little bulkier so you can handle it easier when the device is attached with a music portable device.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful, go for it... its worth it... its worth it.
6304493681|5|Ghost in the Shell takes the most common themes of Japanimation and shows it to you in a different spectrum, wide open solidly in one point of departure, from there its interpretation expands to everyone's own perception of the concept. The film essential story uncovers the elusive meaning of life by this new technological era, where everything can be assimilated by computer intelligence and political will to drain information and manipulate the spheres of power with all their generous killing for the sake of National Security, but the movie goes even further, convey modern science and method is the existentialistic question represented metaphorically by Motoko Kusanagi, in a multiplex compilation of uncertainty and doubt into the depths of artificiality. No cheap Matrix Reloaded philosophy, no free given action, just pure state of the art reflection and a resolution of the story line that is completely breathtaking, the result ends in the beginning of a new frontier of thoughts and memories.<BR>Similar at first sight with Blade Runner, but far from it's point of view and treatment, Ghost in the Shell offers both emotion and sense, with smooth and much wise touches of intellectuality expressed in a level of animation that takes this genre and style to new boundaries. The Wachowski Brother (The Matrix trilogy), took from here their visual style and blended closely in flesh and blood, but always the main source stays magnificent, becoming the standard for new projects in this field; unprecedented. <BR>Complex and beautiful, the film enters a world based on computerization of the human being, over specialization, and the unique characteristics of our personalities, the Ghost is the only thing that separates the organic real from absolute artificiality. And so, we are connected to a vast net, parallel to our own world, complex overwhelmingly by information, life multiplies responses and conducts improving it self by mechanic adjustments, man defines it's actions, but actions defines mankind, no proof of existence, where no modern science nor philosophy can't give an accurate explanation of life, a fragile state of lost conscience and greed for the objective in every aspect of life. <BR>Project 2501, becomes aware of his existence, and so targets Kusanagi for his only and last attempt to blend himself and the Mayor for the organic achievement of breeding, perhaps to fully become touch by emotions and the tragic fate of dying someday, it really doesn't matter, all for the being, away from the synthetic is the goal, anything else is unsubstantial, beneath the remains, politically it ends in a draw, individually it ends in new possibilities with never before seen points of view, a completely new life, a new born child, this is the analogy of doubt becoming answer. <BR>Mamoru Oshii directed this landmark movie, far surpassing any predecessor  (including the legendary Akira), in both animation and storyline. The graphic Japanimation style blended with computer effects, along with the smart script, created an unforgettable piece of science fiction, and most important, contributed the genre with an intellectual mood, elevating Japanimation to the highest level: an adult masterpiece. The film artistic and emotional level is magnified by an excellent original score by Kenji Kawai that perfectly matches every frame and adds more Insight and atmosphere to the story. Detail, architectural design, and colors contrasting the moods by expressing them into forms, pushes every scene to magnification and simple state of the visual manifestation, straight and solid.<BR>A great DVD, where the transferring of every image is a pleasure to watch, the 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is one of the best I've heard so far, and the Making of, illustrates clearly and in much detail the ways of such a magnificent film. This is one of those few pictures that grasp its theme and elegantly enhances it in the big screen for a mesmerizing ride. The Animatrix will be the next step in out breaking Japanimation and story line concerning science fiction, but still this are short films; no animated full length picture is at this level.

6302256615|4|Point Break sports a line-up of 90s stars like Keanu Reaves &amp; Patrick Swayze. Johnny Utah (Keanu) is an FBI agent transferred to Los Angeles where the sunshine, surf and music take his fancy. Special Agent Utah goes undercover among the surfers of the Californian south coast to investigate a near perfect string of bank robberies. There he meets his dark alter ego called Bodhi (Swayze), who becomes a dangerous teacher to him. However, Johnny is quick on the uptake: he stalks his prey ever mindful of Bodhi's most important lesson: If you want the ultimate thrill, you must be prepared to pay the ultimate price. Quite an entertaining movie although it is filled with all those familiar cliches of the teen movie genre, the most amusing being Keanu surfing in the stormy waves and yelling it out: \\"I am Johnny Yooootaw ...!
B000ENWKN8|1|Let me just quote someone else's review:<br /><br />\\"My Roommate, who dosen't normally like Rob Zombie, likes this CD!\\"<br /><br />...<br /><br />Does anyone else find something wrong with that?  I'm sorry, but I don't EVER want to hear an acoustic guitar on a f**king ROB ZOMBIE ALBUM!!!!  When it comes to Rob Zombie we need to hear brutal, evil-sounding music.<br /><br />\\"American Witch\\" is the only good song on the entire album.  I'm not kidding here.  Rob Zombie's face on the cover seems to be saying \\"Oh my god...should I really release this?\\"  Go buy \\"The Sinister Urge\\" instead.
B00571F26Y|4|Davis does a good job of explaining the problems caused by wheat and other glutinous foods. Learned a lot, and now even more committed to low carb and wheat free living.
B000QCS8TW|5|Loved it.
B000002KXV|5|With regard to the sound quality of this cd, there are many out there who are concerned with such things that consider this one of the best sounding cds of all time.  This album is an early 80's all digital recording that was released on cd in the early days of the format.  In that sense it probably sounds exactly as it should.  More and more information is coming out about the current state of audio mastering, about the \\"loudness war,\\" and the virtual elimination of dynamic range in modern day cd's.  The Nightfly is an example of how cd's are suppose to sound.  If it doesn't seem \\"loud\\" enough, try adjusting the volume on your stereo.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This is the best game ever. Play this app on my kindle, then when I run out of lives I play it on my phone.
B009NFHF0Q|5|Excellent!
B006LG7O38|5|Great take on the original Fright Night movie. I think this movie is better than the first. The effects were very realistic.
B000EOTAM6|2|This movie is a great example of what's wrong with too many action adventure movies these days.  The concept is great, the special effects flawless.  Charlize Theron is terrific in the role.  The directing is wonderful.   <br /> <br />What's the problem?  They forgot that even with action movies, you still need to tell a story.  The plot has one small twist, then lies as straight as a road through Montana.  It is sort of kind of a detective \\"uncovering the information\\" plot, but none of the information uncovered is surprising or even interesting. <br /> <br />You are not told how Aeon Flux gets to be a super ninja babe, and she barely has time to establish herself as one before she has to start revealing her softer feminine side in the stereotypical way these movies require.  None of the characters in this movie are compeling.  They hardly show the bad guys doing bad things so you aren't really all that invested in them getting their comeuppance.  There is no real tension in the movie, there is no last minute saving of anything, and not really that much of a threat that gets overcome.   <br /> <br />Overall, it was a cool idea, but they should have hired some actual writers who had a sense of storytelling to do the script.
B007J4T2G8|4|This book was very interesting.  Although it could have been written a little better, it still maintained my interest and made me want to find my own Mr. Grey!  I enjoyed this book so much that I also bought the other two, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed.  It's full of desires that any woman would want but would not want to talk about.  Great book, I enjoyed it.
B00HVLUR18|5|I love these headphones! Beautiful, crisp and clear sound. I use them as my primary sound designing monitors for my various synthesizers, and having used several different brands of headphones that were double the price, I find these to be equal and often superior to the others.

B00D7Z4GQY|3|I enjoyed how the different characters (who appeared to have no ties to each other) evolved and became part of same story.  the &#34;husband's secret&#34; was revealed fairly early into the story and then lost much of its intrigue for me.

B00H43WOAK|1|I have the wired and now the wireless cuff. I will be taking the wireless one back to Apple. I need it for my 16 year old daughter who has medical problems and our doctors want accurate pressures at home. This product is highly inaccurate it will not take pressures on my daughter measurement failed error. When I use it on myself it tells me basically I should go to the hospital. The wired cuff that I've had for years now gives high readings also we took it to the doctors office with us to see how accurate it was and it is way off. Save your money don't buy this product.
B002ZP1STK|5|Fantastic movie!!!!
B0000025DV|5|one of my roommates questioned where i had heard of this album. i told him the old testament. he believed me and bought it. i suggest you do the same. <br /> <br />i like the pop on this album. if you like this, listen to merzbow, the parallels are uncanny!
B004AKCMD4|4|Visually stunning film...especially if you're able to watch it on Blu Ray. You can tell they tried to cram a bigger story in a small time space, so there were parts of the story that suffered because of that but it was an enjoyable movie and and i can definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the books that its based off of or anyone who is just into great film making.
B000JMKTLO|4|This was a pretty decent mystery/horror? I found it a bit over the top at times making it unbelievable, but still an okay and quick read.
B00KZ6WRAA|5|Messenger is a great app!
B000XUBFE2|5|I'm so happy I read this book. Although very sad and sickening in many ways, this book is written so well you can almost forgive that. I've read many books pertaining to WWII and Hitler and enjoyed almost all of them. This, by far, is my favorite. You fall in love with so many characters. And your heart aches for each one. A must read!
014241493X|1|Honestly I was expecting much more out of this book than what I received. John Green is a fantastic author but this book is one of his worst...<br /><br />Do to the fact that it was a book written by John Green I had to get it. Once I stared reading the book it didnt catch my attention right away, i mean there were parts of the book that caught my attention and made me think &#34;Is this where it gets interesting?&#34;, but nope through out the book it just seemed really boring to me.<br /><br />Not worth your money, go check it out at a library or something. Also i honestly just think that people gave such a high rate to this book just because it was written by John Green.<br /><br />Didnt finish the last 30 pages, it was just so boring and typical of a guy having a crush on the popular girl, just turns out that the girl ends up running away leaving the guy to look for her. Really boring dont get it.

B004D7GU3C|5|This album is the best!  This new album definitely shows an incredible and thoroughly different twist to Ricky Martin's style in performing.  He is a true artist. I thought the songs, Best Thing about Me is You & Shine were truly wonderful and upbeat. If you enjoy the music of Ricky Martin, this one is for you.
B00CNQ7CRI|5|I love a laugh out loud novel. This book was funny,real, had heart and just enough sappiness. It was a good, quick read.
B000XUBFE2|5|The story within; the story of the people next door, down the street--of the people and especially the children...the personal drama and familial struggle within the emergence and development of the Nazi party in the lead up to, and then the tragedies of WWII. There is a message of hope throughout the story. The characters, especially the children, are so adaptable...a historical novel about the plight of Jewish families living/strugglilng in Germany during WWII, filled with love and caring? We know how this story 'ends.' Yet, I didn't find the narrative haunting--despite what lingers the children's adventures remind us/show us the spirit of life, of survival through the harshest challenges.
B00IUBXPEY|5|Not too fond of the first one, but this one nailed it. I did not notice at all it's length, I was engaged the entire time.
B006LSZECO|5|Great book.  Very well written.  I love how the chapters go back and forth from one characters' perspective to the other.  Flynn is a fantastic novelist and Sharp Objects and Dark places are also must-read books.  I can't wait for another one from this author!
0316777722|5|I had requested this book as a birthday gift and received it.  I had heard David on National Public Radio and thought he was fun and funny.  I read the book and this collection of short stories just gave me hours of entertainment.  After I finished reading it I kept telling people about it and the stories.  Just goes to prove everyone has a strange family if you give it some thought.  I found this a great pick-me-up book and would recommend it to anyone who just wants some light and fun reading.
1501106422|5|I can't wait to see the movie.  Wonderful book.  Very interesting.  I love true stories.

B0051UP5NQ|5|If you have a kindle HDX and want an app that can create docs, spreadsheets and graphics this is your app check it out.  WOW.  G this is a fantastic d if office product.
B00005QZ7U|1|My review wont be fair because I only saw the first 15min of the movie. That's all I could take. I didn't see anything that resembled a story or acting. Just a fast moving camera, people screaming and horrible music. After 15 solid minutes of that I had to shut it off. It was making me sick to my stomach.
B00KNWYDU8|4|Although it didn't work on my ipod I redownloaded it on a different device and I can't stop playing I would recommend this app especially if you like dragonvale
B00008DDSC|2|I'm going to keep this as short as possible, as I have a tendency to write really long reviews and if I spend too much time expressing disdain for anything I get very depressed.<br />I was very dissapointed with this movie. I suppose I was deceived by the fact that it was playing at the Angelika when I went to see All the Real Girls (a far better, far sweeter, indie romance). I think this is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. Director Steven Shainberg uses dull, uncreative angles, which don't help the struggling script. James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal are both very good on their own, but don't work well together. The &quot;awkward&quot; pauses between conversation are too long, making it seem like both actors are silently counting to a number before saying their next line. The whole &quot;love story&quot; doesn't seem to fit. There is no gradual falling in love between the two throughout the course of the movie. Rather, Lee (Gyllenhaal) runs out of her boyfriends house in her wedding dress and tells Grey (Spader) she loves him. It's as if Shainberg uses it to justify the whole BDSM-thing. He dumps this pseudo-sentimental litter on our laps and expects us to take it. I didn't buy it. This isn't a love story, this is a failed indie romance. We're supposed to feel for the characters, but I don't. They just seem like they're lonely, sad people who can't help themselves.<br />Controversial movies about the taboos of society can be great, if the director is talented and the screenplay is good. Alas, the director is inexperienced, the script is weak, and the movie suffers for it. Not a good pick for a summer afternoon.
B00H7VCKKS|4|Its what you would expect from the Fast & Furious franchise.  They continue to put out great movies!  Will miss Paul Walker very much.  The franchise wont be the same without him...
B00CEZJT2E|4|Seems more like 4000-5000mAh based on my phone charge.<br /><br />Otherwise, everything about it is perfect.
B000002KET|5|This was one of my first introductions to Sabbath, often put off by the overtly `dark' vibes that seemed somewhat clich&eacute;d, I never really gave Sabbath much of a listen, that is until this album completely crushed my ignorance. This album is undeniably one of Sabbath's best, the sound is perfect and everything you'd want from a `classic' metal album. At times the band venture into a more synth-heavy sound, something a little more experimental than previous releases, but the relentless Iommi riffing and piercing screams of Ozzy are still there, and as good as ever.<br /><br />As mentioned above Sabbath ventured into new ground with a higher emphasis on synthesizers, for me it's hit and miss. The two songs that feature the synth most heavily are the dreamy `Who Are You?' and the fine closer `Spiral Architect', when listening to `Who Are You?' today, the synths are somewhat dated and become monotonous, while probably being rather cutting edge and `spaced-out' sounding in its day, its nothing special now, thus making the only weak song on the album. In sharp contradiction the use of synths on `Spiral Architect' is far subtler, instead of becoming the main feature it simply adds to the lush guitar and vocal melodies, the dreamy atmosphere really works here and provides a fine ending to the album.<br /><br />The rest of the music, except the short instrumental `Fluff', is pure guitar driven Sabbath at it's best. The title track opener is amongst their best work, the riffs are punishing while retaining a wondrous `groove' sense. `A National Acrobat' is another fine piece, much like the title track the song is split into two main sections, the latter section being a fine groove laden expedition of Iommi's distinguished riffing. `Sabbra Cadabra' is an instant winner, and deservedly one of Sabbath's most recognised pieces. My personal favourite on the album comes in `Killing Yourself To Live', the numerous riffs are all utterly compelling, especially the sinister chorus melody that accompanies Ozzy's wild screams. Once again the song takes a different direction creating another two section structure, the second part to `Killing Yourself To Live' is the perfect example of what groove laden metal should sound like, and what many of the modern era `stoner' bands try to re-create.<br /><br />This is a must have for any fan of hard rock/metal, Sabbath are undeniable metal heroes, and this album showcases their full armoury.elody that accompanies Ozzy's wild screams.

B002SR2PKG|5|I first read this book as a 13 year old girl in high school and fell in love with Bill, Ben, Bev, Mike, Eddie, Richie..and yes. Even Henry Bowers and his crew..and especially Pennywise The Dancing Clown.<br /><br />Now as a grown woman of 33, I decided to revisit Derry, Maine and it's every bit as frightening as I remember.
B00P7PBD2C|5|Awesome.
B00GLX1MG6|5|Nice for family. Being from Wisconsin it remind us of Wisconsin Dells, the people visit and those who live here. Nice vacation.
B00KMILO1E|1|does not work and other reviews have said the same
B001XVCYH2|4|Watched it for the second time (since the first release) and it was still visually stunning with great action and fast pace.
B00GTCECVG|5|I spent a long time to get where I am today in this game, and it has finally paid off! I am a master of the game, and I have 3000+ gems!!!!!! Truely epic.

B005D6O12O|3|The shoe fit fine accept they are too narrow across the instep.  I did not discover that until I had wore them a couple of hours.  Suddenly the comfortable shoe started to hurt and my feet started to swell.  Either buy them too big or wear them less than two hours.
B00005JKNF|4|We enjoyed this movie and found it entertaining.  We bought it because Maggie Smith had a role in it and she is always great.
B00BTYU3SK|5|Recieved my order on time and just as promised!!! Two thumbs up!!!
B00GY0HJ4K|3|It starts out fun, even addictive. Then it becomes all about making money. The levels get to where u can not get the level done without purchasing more time, not cool... needless to say, I have been stuck at one level for a week now!
B004PMVSFA|5|It is what it is. If you're looking for am Oscar award winning shoe, this isn't it. But if you want a good family movie to watch and spend time together, this is it.
0307895505|5|My son was very happy to receive this. He found it indispensable.

1583335080|5|Excellent.  Highly motivating, well written, funny, purposeful.  Recommend it
B003TOMAPC|4|I liked the story and the characters, and the movie keeps you engaged (OK, the ending fight scene was a bit over the top, which is why 4 stars not 5) but I recommend it because it's sorta like &#34;Mystery Men&#34; in that it's for the other guys, the guys that aren't super but keep trying until they figure it out. Looking forward to watching &#34;Kick-Ass 2&#34; to see where the story goes.
B00IX9UTLU|5|Great story ,I couldn't put it down sometimes.When I finished the last book,I went back a couple of chapters and reread them,as tothink someone can do those things to another person and hurt them like that.But what a difference when your heart gets in the way.
B000VBIGD6|5|This is the second time I have purchased this movie.  The first time I loaned it to my sister and she just wouldn't give it back, so I had to order it again.  My husband and I love the Vacation movies and the Christmas one is our favorite one.  It just never gets old.
B0000A7W14|4|What I enjoy most about this movie, is not what I particularly enjoyed when it first came out. Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can't be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is \\"I can't teach him how to be a man, that's your job.\\" How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne's charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, \\"I know you think I'm being hard on you Tre, but I'm not. What I'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don't have anyone to do that, your'e gonna see how they end up, too.\\" I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I'd have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre's mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how \\"real\\" Furious was. \\"Young\\" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe. Overall a great movie; it's success made it harder for corporate America to ignore the reality of inner-city youth as it exists today.
630463949X|2|I think Billy Burnete and Rick Vito, along with Lindsey should have returned. What I hated about this tape was &quot;Stand Back&quot; was delayed till the tour. &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot; if you  can't sing it don't try. &quot;Everywhere&quot; I hated this version,  Stevie and Lindsey should have sung lighter to give Christine,  Sharon(stevies freind and back up singer), and Mindy sing it. &quot;Go  INsane&quot; this song was tacky. &quot;Songbird&quot; showcased how much  Christine had lost her voice. &quot;The Chain&quot; oh, I loved &quot; the  Mirage Video&quot; version better, when Stevie and Chris was high it kicked  ass. The good highlight was &quot;Over my head&quot;, &quot;Landslide&quot;  &quot;Sweet Girl&quot; &quot;Don't Stop&quot; and &quot;Silver  Springs&quot; plus &quot;So Affraid&quot;<br />Where is &quot;Little  Lies&quot;, &quot;save me&quot;, &quot;7 wonders&quot;, &quot;Hold me&quot;  and &quot;Sara&quot; + &quot;Sisters&quot;
B0089LOG02|5|Great historical fiction
B00GP0G0IK|1|I can't play it yet after having to wait over 3 hours for it to download and it still hasn't finished  !!!
B005OCFHHK|4|Our family enjoyed these movies. My husband and I hadn't read the books or seen any of the movies, so after having surgery we had plenty of time to finally sit and watch them. It was great seeing the characters grow and develop, much easier to follow the story line watching them all in sequence! They are long, so 8 movies is a lot of time to spend....
B00HTYU2XK|5|I love these guys and the way the BBC has done this.  Very good  Keeps me interested in an age old mystery.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Great show! The characters are so relatable. But I was not prepared for the plot twists this season. What will they do with the next?
B00BOTCJXC|5|Just the miniseries to watch on a slow weekend. Benedict Cumberbatch delights and entertains like only he can.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is addictive u don't even know!!! And it is so fun so I recommend it(:<br /><br />If u found this helpful thank you I will pray too u.
B000EUDAWG|2|It's definitely really cool toy for about 1 hour before it dies/breaks lol. It cannot roll on anything but absolutely perfectly smooth surfaces too. The shipping was fast and nice but product is just a dud.
B00OKYQZDI|5|I just started playing and I love it. 5 Stars
B004U52VPS|5|Build it knock it down build again. My son loves this game. He either plays it the way intended or just plays Witt eh birds included. Good price for a toy that can be used multiple ways to entertain a child.
B0029LCJJS|5|Excellent
B0086700CM|5|this is a great app for anyone that is looking for seemimgly endless fun. dot dot dot dot dot dot
B00000G3I2|4|I can understand why modern viewers do not appreciate this film and give it negative reviews. I was born after Vietnam, and I was too young to watch this film when it came out in 1983, but I wanted to check out what all the hype was about. Not having been a crusader for the anti-establishment in the late 60's, only to suck it up and join the corporate world by age 30, I had to really work to appreciate this movie. It is much more natural for someone who lived through having the ideals of a late 60's college age student to identify and relate to the stuggles of the characters in this film.<br /><br />Without the historical context, this is still a good movie about friendship and the ways people change in just a decade's worth of time. I caution younger viewers to keep an open mind and to put this film in perspective when they check it out.
B00EOO55GW|5|This album is an ode to late 90's metal/rock.  Some tracks are reminiscent of Metallica and Iron Maiden.  Totally worth a purchase if you feel like &#34;Rock N Roll&#34; isn't really the same as it used to be.  I love all the songs on this album except for doing time and planets.  They are decent but not as good as the other songs in my opinion.
B0094BB4TW|4|Not enough description on how to use. Just shy of making it simple for kindle also feel same about Ipad
B002ZB26AO|5|This was a great read for anyone interested in learning about North Korea.  The  writer repeats herself a bit but the story telling is really compelling for a non-fiction historical book.  Everyone should read this.
B009PF93LS|5|Love this CD (album).  Next best thing to Bing Crosby.  Sent copies to my relatives.  Bought it specifically for my daughter.
B00DUGCLY4|5|Get Goodyear ever
B0086700CM|5|Easy to learn,  with great graphics foot the kindle fire...  a bit sensitive at first,  but this can be adjusted by the User.
006016848X|5|Not since Carl Sagan and I.S. Shklovskii's now out-of-print bombshell 'Intelligent Life in the Universe' has a single book had such a profound impact on the way humanity views itself in the context of the larger cosmos.  As I have long maintianed to my catankerous and obdurate therapist, Dr. Wittgenstein, and the executor of my trust, Richard \\"screw the visionary out of his millions\\" Enterobacterium Johnson, III, Esquire, any [person]can see the clear evidence all around us that there has been a human presence on Mars and Venus since at least the early 50's if not sooner, aided largely by the engineering help received from communication with extraterrestrials that was first initiated during Project Ozma and is covered even today by the thin charade of setiathome, which harnesses the power of thousands of computers worldwide to the benefit of the pentaveret and their intergalactic allies, while pretending to the patsies running the program that 'no signal has been found'.  Hah.  Ever since I found out the truth about the existence of intelligent life in the universe I have been alone in my struggle, but now the brilliant John Gray has joined the forces of the righteous.  The price is steep, John.  They will tap your phone- they will leave evidence to suggest to your girlfriend that you slept with her sister, and even brainwash that sister into going along with the story, when in fact you never never slept with Cindy!  ...They will hire actors who resemble you to be recorded on department store security cameras exposing yourself to patrons and shoplifting Ho-ho's.  Be strong, righteous John, for only true moral fortitude can help us throw off the yoke of our evil space overlords.  ...
B0013F1D02|5|Saw it in theaters when it first came out. Great star lineup an a real surprise for Deniro! Five stars Fer sure
B00005M1CO|3|Listening to the preview clips from this album, it sounds beautiful, catchy, and competent.  And indeed, the bits of music in the previews are all of those things.  However, the previews very poorly represent the full songs.    This album exemplifies what may be Elvenking's greatest weaknesses.  With the notable exceptions of Pagan Purity, the Regality Dance and Seasonspeech, each song sounds like it was cobbled together from a mix of half-formed ideas, spare melodies, and clips swept up off the cutting room floor.  Beautiful songs are interspersed with pieces of what sound like completely different songs.  Worse songs.  Random segments of growls - both low and high - abound, turning what might be a great blend of folk and metal into something ridiculous.  Some songs seem to have no unifying theme at all and are instead just a medley of undercooked ideas.  Worst of all, some of these short clips are breathtakingly good, and it is heartbreaking that they now will never develop into full songs of their own.    There is some good music to be found here but only if you're willing to work - or wait - for it.  If not, I'd recommend any of Elvenking's other albums instead.
B005LAIH54|5|Sam  Worthington is great in this movie, I watch it every time they show it on  TV.
B00FEMJF6O|3|Overall, it's a very fun game. But unless you're ready to spend real money for coins and crowns, the thrill goes quickly.
B00E66QPCG|4|Nothing new here but all explained in clear manner and will definitely help you to develop skills in trading futures.
B00B19DW0E|5|One of my all time favorite movies.
B002N5N5LG|5|I was a little skeptical of this show, but watched it mainly because of Joel McHale. I am so glad I did. It is very funny and the cast is great. They all work very well together. I stopped watching this show by accident when I forgot to record a number of episodes. I'm very excited for the DVD release to catch up and get ready for season 2
B00003CX96|5|The qualities of this film are exactly what make me watch movies. It's the story of a small town Indiana nineteen year old that is at that stage in his life where school is finished, and the decisions are many. It takes place in small town America and makes you want to live in a simpler time (it IS from 1979).  <br />   What is so good about this film is the relateability that I think anyone can find in it.     <br />   There are friends, teenage desires, and misunderstanding parents. It's sad that there aren't more movies like this around these days. Movies that are simple, have a strong message, and are phenomenally put together are few nowadays; especially ones that make you wish you could live in that simpler time, as this one did with me. <br />   This is the kind of movie that draws you in so much that you find yourself watching the end of the credits and have to force yourself to get up off the couch. <br />   Go watch it, you won't regret it.
B00PSLQGX6|5|Outstanding!!
B00AO2TREY|5|The album is great. I really enjoyed the first listen through of the album.  The accompanying DVD is awesome.  I totally want to see them live now.  They definitely need and deserve some air play in the US.  They are one of my favorite new alternative/electronic bands.
B000XPU5NY|4|I was hoping to see the oficial material of this new Genesis world tour after all the bootlegs I heard from it. Sure I knew what to expect, and I once again hit this same key: a wonderful idea that the band decided touring again over the world, but they lack the old energy from their previous concerts. Most part of the classic tunes are executed in a lower key, so they all miss that energy and Phil Collins felt the same way.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I still love the band, they continue to be spectacular musicians, every one of them, I still hope they change their minds and give us another album, or at least another tour, and the set of the show is very good. The only problem is that the songs are not executed in their proper keys, giving the impression that the band are tired or something like that. Besides, this is an item every fan should get and give a chance.
B00IRISI42|5|Great read love it
B008Q0B0I2|5|It's pretty good.
0446608955|5|I thought this book was one of the best that I have read in a long time.  I have already read it twice and I'm sure there will be many more times I pick up &quot;A walk to Remember&quot;.  I have read other books by Nichalos Sparks, and I think, by far, this one is the best.  I give it two thumbs up, and I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out.
1476734941|5|Following the two day a week diet has worked miracles for me; I don't really count the calories, but cut way way back for the two days.  Sometimes I put on 2-3 pounds (which I learned can happen overnight from some foods that my body has an issue with, but after one of my diet days, I'm back to my lower weight.  I have lost 12 pounds in a matter of months.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Have been a fan since season 1!
0316666343|5|&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; by Alice Sebold is an exhilarating book to read. It is full of suspense and keeps you reading until the last page of book! Sebold's word choice and descriptions make you feel like you are there in the book! I recommend that you shouldn't start reading &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; unless you can finish reading it! <BR>&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; by Alice Sebold is mesmerizing! Susie Salmon a 14 year old girl who is brutally raped and murdered by her neighbor tells the story about the circumstances of her murder through her eyes, while she is in heaven. I found this unusual story because it is told from the perspective of the murdered victim. Even though you know who kills her and how she is killed in the very beginning of the book, the story is still suspenseful through Susie Salmon's eyes, and her family and friends trying to cope with her death and find out the missing pieces of the puzzle. The question of whether Susie's killer would be caught was enough to keep me reading. You will also find yourself thinking about your ideas of life after death, as Alice Sebold presents a different picture of heaven than most of us have ever thought of.
B008XBCJ34|5|All 3D movies pale in comparison... story line, alternate world creation, cgi... flawless!  Even after seeing more than once You still grab the arms of the chair in excitement and suspense. I am waiting for someone to come close...
B007SYWFRM|5|I found this game to be really fun and lasts a lot longer than those 60 level games. I was looking for something to peek my interest. And I sure found it in this game! If you like building worlds and maintaining your people/animals in them this game is for you...
B00XQ141W8|5|Mad Max fans like myself have always wondered what George Miller would do with a 100 million plus budget, and I for one was very pleased with the results. This is basically a B movie with a huge budget. Great fun. A wonderful Remake of The Road Warrior with A list actors thrown in.
B007J4T2G8|1|This author has to have the best selling agent around. How did this book become a  #1 NY Times bestseller? I'm angry that I was duped into buying and reading it. I found myself &#34;rolling my eyes&#34; in disgust and boredom as this &#34;story&#34; dragged on and on and ... I was relieved when it ended although I do admit the final pages were the highlight. For a nano - second I was curious to know the source of Christian's problem and if it gets resolved. However, I have no intention of reading more or of recommending it to anyone. As another reviewer said, part way through I was compelled to look up the author in an attempt to fathom the source of this childish narrative. A grown woman? Erotic? I don't think so. Laughable? Amen!
B007EC27QM|5|This is a 5 star calculator a lot better than the one that comes with any devices that I seen.

B006LSZECO|5|Good read.  The characters are unreal.  Kept me hooked through the whole book. I just finished reading it and wanted more.
B00OIG3BLW|5|Great , Really Enjoyed
B000YABIQ6|5|This is a great series. Love the script, cast, costumes, characters and design. Hoping for more seasons to come. please.
B00KMX5V8G|3|Really cute, really fun, but by level 47, the difficulty has become completely unreasonable ... clearly meant to force purchases.  I would rather just pay for the game up front and be able to play more.
B007XC9BSK|5|Good
B0068857QA|5|Was entertaining for me...lots of swearing and comedy only found when a group of men have to deal with each other everyday.  Was intrigued that no one dies in their squad.
B002VHI8J0|2|I found it very hard to get into this book. Just when I had got into it the story changed and I had to try to get into a new character and different time all over again - several times. I found it irritating.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Written from an interesting perspective unlike most novels.  Good insight into the ravages of alcohol addiction.
B0001CNRS4|3|This movie was a dancing movie. It is about a girl from the projects who achievs her passion for dancing....how interesting. really, c'mon, who da @$*k would wanna see that? the only reason i saw it is because jessica alba was HOT... but really it was like a chic flick. w.e

B00A9ET4MC|5|Ms Adichie writing is just beautiful! Her style is reminiscent of the old classics and this story is brilliant! Many great 'hmmmmm' moments and my motivation to get up on time just to read on my way to the office!
B00006EXL5|5|Yeah. One of the best damn cds out there. After an...interesting...intro, the album kicks off into sheer amazingness with the first song; &quot;Honey, this mirror isn't big enough for the two of us&quot; (great live, I might add). &quot;Headfirst for Halos&quot; is a dash of inspirational music with a variety of...charmingly morbid lyrics, i.e. &quot;And I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling&quot;, while &quot;Demolition Lovers&quot; is simply an amazing tragic love song. Worth mentioning also is &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows, one of the best on the album. This CD makes my top five. And we all know how valued my opinion is amongst you fellows.
B00CDTSFF8|5|Husband loves!  If you like Sparticus, give this show a go.
B004ZGI1V0|4|I am a Liam Neeson fan, and I enjoyed this movie.  Suspenseful and interesting.  At the end of the movie I felt just as I was supposed to feel, happy about the way it turned out.  Then I thought, &#34;wait a minute, if this happens then there will be a global glut of corn on the market, the price of corn will go to hell in a hand basket, American farmers will go broke by the thousands, the price of prime farm ground will plummet, and a major part of my retirement assets will evaporate.&#34; Thank god it is only a movie!
B0001UL7RY|5|To begin with, \\"Under My Skin\\" is definitely a must have for any Avril fan or the people who is starting to be her fans, because, I think it's a bit different from \\"Let Go\\". In this album, she expresses more things and it's a more personal album than \\"Let Go\\". I think that's why it's called \\"Under My Skin\\", and I personally found it better than the debut album. There is just one song I think she shouldn't have recorded with the rhythm it has, because the letter is kind of deep; I'm talking about \\"Forgotten\\". It's the track eight and if you can hear it in the music sampler, do it.<br /><br />I have four personal favorite songs:<br />Take Me Away (1): A great song to begin the album<br />My Happy Ending (6): You must have heard it already; it was a single<br />Nobody's Home (7): My favorite song in the antire album! It's the current single. You must like it!<br />Who Knows (9): It's a very up song, which makes you feel happy, and it's the most \\"pop\\" song in the album (it's like \\"Complicated\\" in \\"Let Go\\", but better...)<br /><br />You should really buy it, you won't be dissapointed at all.
B00FATEJYE|1|Won't load<br />Stays stuck at 40-50% I love the game on Apple devices on my iPhone and iPad and I would love if I could play on kindle

067443000X|4|As a non-economist, I cannot claim to appreciate the deeper insights of this work. However, I would recommend it to the general reader as a thoughtful, &#34;introduction-minded&#34; exploration of wealth inequality in the coming century. It's not hard to 'learn as you go' with this work, exploring a variety of economic concepts slowly and diligently as Piketty leads you through his massive analysis. The book is not designed to intrigue or stun or entertain you; it is a relatively humorless but fair, precise and thoughtfully constructive mass of argument and analysis. This is less a 'bestseller' than a 'treatise,' and you should prepare yourself for a difficult thought rewarding enterprise.
B0000024JA|5|Despite of the unfortunate flooding of the studio were thiz album waz recorded (RZA'z studio) This album iz a classic if U ask me, wit' banga's like 'bring the pain', 'All I need' and Release yo' delf (actually U neva have 2 skip a song), thiz is a good hardcore album.

B00IS87HYI|5|The game is fun to play.  Although in the beginning it was a little hard to now what to do.
B005FMZX9Q|5|Love the watch, the size is perfect and it's easy to customized and change looks by changing the band on it. Perfect Father's Day gift.
B004GJDQT8|5|After the issue I was having and the quick resolution I am very happy with how prompt things were handled
B006LSZECO|5|What can I say.  Great book.  Saw the movie too.  Unforgettable and original.<br /><br />Frannie
B003M6EAXM|5|I have the other seasons on DVD and I like them all.<br />Good twists in the story and always a surprise around the corner.
B001DJLCRC|5|Probably one of the best tv series ever aired. It is very hard to only watch one episode. I'm addicted. All the actors are fantastic. Walter Whites transition makes you root for the bad guy. Its neat watching Bryan Cranston go from Hal on Malcom in the Middle to Heisenburg on Breaking Bad. If you decide to watch this show, watch it from beginning to end. Not one episode is worth missing.
B00000DHRZ|5|I did not hear about The Offspring before hearing their catchy songs on the videogame Crazy Taxi. I got \\"Americana\\" as a present and I loved it! Now I am a huge fan of the rock band. This is what I think about each song: <br />1. Intro (0:09) NO GRADE <br />A basic intro. An automated voice says, \\"Welcome to Americana\\". <br />2. Have You Ever (3:56) A <br />An awesome starting song. I love the lyrics and it is extremely catchy. I can really relate to the song, so I listen to it a lot. <br />3. Staring At The Sun (2:13) B <br />I like the beginning, but I really dislike that the song gets really fast. If they kept the same tempo throughout the song, I would have given the song a higher grade. After a few listens, the fast tempo gets less annoying and more fun to listen to. Great music, cool lyrics. <br />4. Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) (3:08) A- <br />This song reminds me a lot of one of the wannabees in my grade. I really like this song because of its great music, funny voices, and good lyrics. The video is also very funny. <br />5. The Kids Aren't Alright (3:00) A <br />This song really makes you think. Very good lyrics and music that enhances the song a lot. I like the line \\"how can one little street swallow so many lives\\". Great chorus, awesome verses. I love this song! <br />6. Feelings (2:52) C <br />I don't really like this song, but it grows on you. Compared to the great songs on this album, you will probably pass this song. The lyrics are not too good, but the fast-paced and the singing is good. The chorus makes up for the not-so-great verses. Not terrible, but the rest of the album is better. <br />7. She's Got Issues (3:48) B+ <br />Slower than most of the other songs on the album, but still a good song. The song is funny and kind of depressing at points. The lyrics are great, the chorus is O.K., and the music accompanies the lyrics well. Good song. <br />8. Walla Walla (2:57) B <br />A song about a friend going to prison. The band makes fun of the persongoing to \\"walla walla\\" which is funny. Great music, and the lyrics are pretty good. The song eventually gets annoying and the other songs on the album are better. <br />9. The End of the Line (3:02) B <br />This song is depressing because it is about death, but with this band's reputation their songs can't get too sad. The music is good and so are the lyrics. Decent song, a good listen. <br />10. No Brakes (2:04) C <br />I don't like this song very much. Kind of annoying. The verses are not too good, but the chorus is. There are much better songs out there, and a lot are on this album. <br />11. Why Don't You Get A Job (2:52) A <br />A funny parody of \\"Obladi, Oblada\\" by The Beatles. Actually, the songs have almost nothing in common, except for the chorus tune. This song is funny, catchy, and has a great video. One of the best songs on the album. <br />12. Americana (3:15) A <br />The beginning of the song is used on the Crazy Taxi menu screen. I like the part leading up to the lyrics, and the lyrics are really good, too. The music is great. This song is one of the best songs on the album. <br />13. Pay The Man (10:21) A <br />The beginning of the song (the part leading to the lyrics) is 3 minutes long. The real rock song starts at 4:53. The lyrics at the beginning are very well written. The rock song is also pretty good, featuring more great lyrics and catchy music. One of the best songs on the album. The song then takes a break at 8:06 and the \\"Pretty Fly Reprise\\" starts at 9:16, which has a mariachi band play the tune to \\"Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)\\". What a way to end the album! <br /> <br />Overall, this album gets a B+. There are a lot of awesome songs on the album that makes it one of my favorite rock albums ever. There are some decent songs and two bad ones, but still if you don't buy this album, you'll miss out on a great adventure through rock.
B00DJFIMW6|5|great...just great...!!! we need more games like this please make a second part i like it... i love it....we love it...hahaha..great job... im out of words...
B00D6SBOWG|5|AWESOME GAME!  I love it!  it is the best game I have ever got! it is golf and solitare mixed together.
B00009W0U4|3|From the start you are sent reeling as the spiraling camera work leads you down through a darkened gay sex dungeon to a scene of revenge inspired violence. The rape scene which spawns this vengeance is unflinching and brutal to the point of nausea. As the movie unwinds in reverse time the seemingly normal and unassuming events that lead up to this nightmare have a creepy subtlety, since you have already witnessed the bitter end. A harsh movie, but worth seeing as long as you take the honest depiction of such an act.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Awesome game #😀
B0047Y0FGY|4|Love! A great story and coming into your own without being overbearing. Tina showed that you can be a woman in business without losing yourself.

B000002UB6|5|Easily the most disregarded album amongst the Beatles' body of work, Let it Be contains some of the bands best tracks, even if they were basically solo efforts.  Although it was recorded prior to Abbey Road, Let it Be sat shelved for about a year before it finally saw the light of day.  The story goes that Paul and John were belligerent with each other during the making of this album but that didn't seem to effect the quality of music that they were able to contribute together.  \\"Across the Universe\\" and \\"Let it Be\\" stand up as two of the best tracks the group ever recorded, and \\"Two of Us\\" is one of the albums wonderful hidden gems.  Phil Spector's production has been criticized many times over because of his use of strings and his (many feel) innapropriate (for the Beatles) wall of sound.  However, most of the original music was unchanged.  It was clear by the time Let it Be hit stores, the Beatles were quite irritated by the restraints that the band was placing on them as individual musicians.  All of this being said, in no way do I consider Let it Be to be second-rate in any way when compared to other Beatles releases.  In fact, I consider it to be one of the greatest albums of the 1970s, which is no small feat, considering what a revolution in musical styles was soon approaching.
B000003TA4|5|I am 52, female and a music buff since my first transistor radio back in the Stone Age. Of all the bands, over all the years, Nirvana is the one that speaks to me most. Yeah, Nevermind sparked a sorely needed musical 'revolution' but if it had not, this album would STILL have been the best record of the 90's. Kurt Cobain's raw vocals and painfully astute lyrical observations express that dark yearning we all have buried whether we like to admit it or not. Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic add perfect steaming intensity; a foundation that burns like the fire beneath a cannibal cauldren. Melody is the center of Cobain's songs, no matter if he drones, screams or rages, and Novaselic's baseline is the sweet underpinning that gives this music weight and symmetry. And as Kurt said about Grohl when he joined the band \\"He can't dance as good as your MTV favorites, but he beats the drums like he's beating the s--t out of their heads.\\" Nevermind ain't surface stuff; ya really gotta LISTEN. I suggest car stereo, full blast, long drive down a deserted highway...
B005ZOBNOI|5|This is probably the best book that I have ever read! It is amazingly written, I fell in love with the characters. I felt their pain and joy. It was painful to have the book end. 5 stars, absolutely
B0000507PC|5|It disturbs me when people who have no idea of Irving's works and ideology dismiss a great film based on an even greater novel as &quot;pro-abortion propoganda.&quot; <br />&quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; is not propoganda of any sort, nor is it pro-anything. It's a movie. It's also a book. Both mediums tell a story. Yes, the story does include bits about abortion, but is that all it's about? No. &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; is a coming-of-age story about a young man who learns to shape his future. IT is about relationships, it is about love, it is about destiny. Abortion is only apart of this complex web of people and interaction; it is not IT.<br />Five stars for this magnificent film.

B006VFLIYK|4|I love the author's writing style and the way he engages the reader right up to the end!  I'll keep reading more and more.  Not many author's I can say that about.
1442426705|5|I love this book with all of my heart. It is such a wonderful fluffy read. I can't wait to read the sequel.
0525478817|5|Until I read this book. I love everything in this book: the romance, the pain, the death and the life lessons left me touched -- Touched in a way that no other book that I've read has. I laughed, I cried, and I wanted more. I strive to be as Intellectually advanced as John Green is. I recommend this book to everyone who likes John Green or has read any of his other wonderful books
B00DR0PDNE|4|It does what I want it to do. I got this for streaming hulu and Netflix in my bedroom. Cheaper than other devices. I use my Samsumg Galaxy Tab as my remote for my tv and the Chromecast. Works great for these things. I haven't really tried doing anything else.
B00AREIAI8|4|I have just started and am not disappointed. It has glitched a couple times, but nothing too serious. I will update after a while. So far, so good.
B002XED5TY|4|My personal favorite.  A classic in my opinion, and it's all the better for that unmistakable Tim Burton touch.  None of the sequels or remakes measures up to the original.
B003X2O6KW|5|I used to be like most people and hate Kanye because he was so arrogant. (And yes I'm going to mention this because it does change your view on his music) Well I gave his music a chance and he really is amazing. The first album that got me hooked was Late Registration. The whole cd was awesome. Then I got all of his other albums. This one quite possibly might be my favorite. &#34;Hell of a Life&#34; is worth the purchase alone. That track can be on repeat nonstop. Each track leads into each other smoothly, you can literally start the cd and just let it play. There's only one track at the end that's kind of bland but that's it. If your not a huge Kanye fan or just starting to get into him I suggest this album or Late Registration.
B00R7FZ074|5|It was really good.  However, don't buy movies from amazon if you want to download them and watch them later.  I had to cancel this purchase because I wanted to watch it on an airplane, so I could not stream it to my windows tablet.  This is a big problem.
B001BC2ZS6|5|Greatest classic I've read in a while. Steinbeck has done it for me.<br />The ending was a real mouth opener for me.
B000UBMWG4|1|I had to return this set and order a different type. when I got it, I found that it was Blu-ray and I don't have that. I get frustrated with all the different types of the same DVD!
B002N44XSG|5|This book is the best of its kind.  I would recommend it to any Percy Jackson fan.  The book is a definite best seller
B00GM5Y490|5|another great worship set from Casting Crowns thanks. I liked it and hope you will too. be blessed. k k
B001NLKZUA|5|Imaginative! Thought provoking with lots to think about. I'm looking forward to the next book, hopefully due out sooner rather than later.
B0063IH60K|5|I hate waiting in doctor's offices!  Let me repeat, I HATE WAITING IN DOCTOR'S OFFICE!!  Thankfully, I can now keep busy and use my brain matter a bit by using this app.  It's entertaining and quite well done.
B0015DROBO|5|A little slow in the beginning but it was a page<br />turner. I will recommend this to everyone who likes a good story.
B00M4ADWQ8|5|I love this movie I can't watch it enough! :-) I give it 10 stars
B008TRUDAS|5|This is another excellent book by Coleen Hoover. I highly reccomend it and her other two books Point of Retreat and The Edge of Never
B000002TYK|5|I bought this the day it came out, and knew it was something special. Every track is special, yet unique in sound, which is quite hard to do. It rocks fast, slow, hard, and soft, yet sounds astonishing. Dave Grohl played every instrument on this album, displaying his genius. This album still holds up after 8 years.
B00B2V66VS|3|This game is fun and challenging! I love it! My only problem with this game is after you run 3000m or so and you try to use more than one &quot;Save Me&quot; it force stops and closes out of the game but still takes your gem. It wouldn't be that bad but when you go to use for a third time in one run it kicks you off but still takes your gems that's a lot of gems altogether I have lost 17 gems because of this! It's a bit ridiculous! I hope you guys can fix this problem!
B0063IH60K|5|This app works great on my Kindle Fire. The graphics are great and I haven't had any issues at all.
B00FHATBGW|5|So im a huge fan of this genre, but this game is great and possibly one of the best. The puzzles are challenging ( and sometime difficult ), the HOG games are fewer than others but just enough. And the length of the game is well worth the price and time you will spend on it. A ++++
B0000DYJM6|5|A collection of rarities written throughout PJ's career.<br />Play it loud, play it often..
B00992CF6W|5|it is really fun just like the computer version you can't stop playing  it like a magnetic and you can also play multiplayer with other people but it has to be on the same network you can build anything my little cousin like play this game
B0097GVJWQ|5|Excellent! I loved all the clues. the backtracking got to be tiring but entertaining game overall. now I want to do the 2nd one
B00004Z4WQ|5|This moive is carzy, funny, and hilarious!!  Most buy this outrageous movie!!!
B00OXE341G|5|I love it so much.
B00NSN70EK|4|[reviewed version &#34;Amazon-V1.8.0&#34; on Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34; on August 4, 2015]<br /><br />If you like tower defense games, and you like light science fiction, this game is probably worth trying.  It has a touch of light comedy, fairly heavy on the caricature, and just a little bit of stereotypical story.  There are the usual ad networks and analytics and Facebook button and &#34;Please rate me&#34; prompt, but it plays offline and exits cleanly with the back button.  The most annoying thing it does is play fullscreen video ads, at most once a day, but you get a few points for letting it.<br /><br />The graphics are a bit cartoonish and caricatured, but that works well on small screens with lots going on.  They rendered smoothly and quickly on my Kindle Fire HDX, even when there was a lot going on.  Lots of enemy units of many types, defense towers, stationed and air-dropped marines, and all sorts of weapons fire and explosions all over the place, and the graphics kept up without being too hard to tell what was going on.  It could be difficult to target a specific enemy when an important target had to be taken out, but maybe a stylus would help with that.<br /><br />The brightly colored main map is good looking and easy to use rather than realistic.  It only scrolls left and right, yet it starts in a jungle and proceeds through a Nevada desert to the Arctic circle and ends in Egypt.  The individual battle maps are tad more coherent but still focus on looking good and playing well over making sense.  And that's fine.  You should probably be focusing on your strategy anyway.<br /><br />The sound is adequate.  The background is a short loop that would get pretty annoying if you heard it for very long, but once you get into the action, it's all gunshots and explosions and lasers that basically meld into a wave of battle sounds that roughly tell you how well things are going, maybe.  You can make out individual noises when something distinct enough happens, but big waves of mixed enemies encountering all your different towers sounds pretty much like generic battle noise.  And I guess that's just what it should sound like.<br /><br />The gameplay is simple and straight forward.  If you've ever played any tower defense game before, you'll know how this works immediately.  There are only four basic tower types. Machine guns are the basic cheap fast-firing low-damage single-target tower.  Infantry barracks spawn troops that get in the invaders' way and slow them down, but the soldiers can be killed and take time to respawn.  Rocket towers fire slowly, but are the only ones with an area effect.  Laser turrets are the only ones that do full damage to shielded targets.<br /><br />Upgrades and specializations for each tower type can be researched by spending coins that are earned in battle or bought in the shop for real cash.  Research can be accelerated by spending gems that can also be purchased in the shop.  You get a few through game play, but not enough to make a difference.  You also have a squad of heroes that gain experience as you use them and have special abilities that make certain levels easier.  You get to try them out once for free on certain levels, but to keep them regularly available, they have to be purchased for cash.  Gems can also be used to level up the heroes if you don't want to wait for them to gain their improved abilities through practice.  That sounds like a lot of cash shop requirements, but the game is playable without them.  You might just end up grinding levels over and over after the first dozen or so, to earn enough coins to upgrade your towers and experience to upgrade the one free hero.<br /><br />You do not have to make any purchases to unlock levels.  All you have to do is collect stars from previous levels, up to five from each level.  For just surviving the level, you get one.  If you survive with more than half health left, you get two.  If you let none of the aliens past you, you get three.Once you have three stars on a level, you can opt for an extra challenging &#34;Veteran&#34; mode, where you have only a single life to defeat 6 waves of enemies, and only two of the tower types are available.  Beat that, and you unlock SpecOps mode.  For 5 stars, defeat one massive wave of enemies with all four towers again, but still only a single life.  After a few levels, various &#34;challenges&#34; are also unlocked, where you return to previous stages with a variety of different conditions to make them more difficult.  These reward a good number of coins to further your upgrade research and keep the grinding at least a little more varied.<br /><br />There's no advertising for other games from this developer, but you are offered the option to watch a video ad to earn a few coins now and then.  Sometimes it even just plays the ad after a mission without asking, and then gives you the coins if you let it play to the end.  Amazon GameCircle is active, but it's not particularly in the way.  The &#34;How's the game? [Hate it] [Love it]&#34; prompt does go away after you use it once, even it you don't leave any feedback.  There is a button in the options to connect to Facebook, but it doesn't nag you to do so.  Still, if you want to back up your progress or play on a different device, that's the recommended way to do it.<br /><br />The game exits cleanly with the back button, even if notifications are enabled, and it does play offline.  It has permission to access your accounts list, but that's presumably just for in-app purchasing.  AppBrain Ad Detector identifies AdColony, MoblieAppTracking, and Amazon Mobile Ads ad networks, Amazon GameCircle, and mixpanel and Fiksu Mobile App Marketing analytics libraries.  Facebook SDK is curiously not attached.  Overall, not too terrible and pretty much what we've come to expect from free game apps.<br /><br />It's a pretty good game, but not especially outstanding in any way.  It has a few minor or occasional annoyances, but nothing extreme.  If you like sci-fi tower defense, this is a decent choice to keep you occupied until you find a better one.Once you have three stars on a level, you can opt for an extra challenging &#34;Veteran&#34; mode, where you have only a single life to defeat 6 waves of enemies, and only two of the tower types are available.

B000002UJQ|5|OK Computer is simply one of the best rock albums you will ever find. It is more creative and unique than their first two albums, but at the same time it isn't completely out there like their later albums. The variety of guitar sounds is amazing and it's almost unbelieavable that there are very few electronic sounds used. The music ranges from slow laid back songs like The Tourist to powerful guitar driven songs like Paranoid Android. Paranoid Android features some of the best guitar playing you will ever hear. Thom's lyrics explore how technology is affecting humans for the worse and how he wants to escape. <br />    This is probably the best Radiohead album. It is an album that any music lover should own.
B000002ULO|4|Ahhh... Flaiming Pie! Thank you Paul McCartney for this album. Before I start this review I must state that this is my personal favorite of all paul albums.. With that said, I will attempt to give a fair review of it to the average listener..<br />Released in 1997, Paul hit #2 in his first week on the charts with Flaiming Pie. A very 'bare' album, it features mainly Paul himself on all the instruments (Featuring Jeff Lynne, Ringo Starr, James McCartney, and Steve Miller assisting). With simple arraingements and great lyrics throughout, Paul brought himself back to similar situations of recording(ala The White Album).<br />With McCartney playing as the core rhythm section on all but two tracks (Ringo on drums for Beautiful Night and Really Love You) it brings an intimacy and an unpolished feel that has bogged down many of pauls output since the mid seventies. By playing all natural instruments (including NO synths), it makes this album a pleasant experience throughout.<br />But in comes my only complaint to the album... Jeff Lynne in his producing loves to make sounds as bare and loose as possible. This works great for the guitar, bass, and keyboard tracks, but his drum recordings always come through with a very 'boxy' sound. When he records his vocals, he barely, if ever, uses effects to make the vocals shine a little more to create an ambient effect. These are the only reasons I am rating this album at a '4', and not '5'...<br />With that out of the way, lets focus on the material itself. The melodies in the tracks are as strong as ever. Classic McCartney really. But the stand out (which is what suprised most McCartney Nay-sayers) is the lyrics. For the first time in quite a while, Pauls lyrics are very stripped down and bare with simple, clear messages in them. Now of course you have the one or two on the album (Really Love you, Used To Be Bad) that are filler, but they actually seem fun and playful paired with these finely crafted 'compositions'. George Martin (former Beatles Producer) lended a hand on scoring some orchestral arraingements on a few songs here, and he is even quoted as telling paul about the album \\"Your Back!\\"<br />He's definately back in deed! And Paul, what a fitting album to a very retrospective time in your life. Now if we can just keep you in this frame of mind................<br />Buy It! It grows on you...<br />All The Best, The AndyMan!(former Beatles Producer) lended a hand on scoring some orchestral arraingements on a few songs here, and he is even quoted as telling paul about the album \\"Your Back!\\"   <br />He's definately back in deed!

0735204314|2|In an attempt to make his book accessible to the masses, Dr. Murphy has taken a useful truth that contemplatives throughout history have known for centuries and diluted it and dumbed it down to the point that it looses much of its believability. For example, on page 22, he relates a story in which a man says, he would, \\"...give his right arm\\" to see his daughter healed from her arthritis and psoriasis. He then goes on to say that, \\"one day\\" the family got into an automobile accident in which the man lost his arm, but from that point on the daughter's medical problems disappeared. Oh come on! I know an urban legend when I hear one! If your going to make a wild claim like that, you need to back it up with specific documentation, something Dr. Murphy fails to do. Another example of an extraordinary claim which he fails to back up is on page 19 where he states, \\"Your subjective mind can leave your body, travel to distant lands and bring back information that is often of the most exact and truthful character.\\" A claim like that needs to be thoroughly backed up by pages of specific, documented accounts, not just thrown in to be believed without a challenge! I've studied at length the results of the CIA funded SRI study on remote viewing and I can tell you that there is no evidence whatsoever that such a thing is in any way possible! Another problem I have with the book is it's insistance on using Christian references and biblical verses as proof of the doctor's claims. While he does this in a more deistic fashion than mainstream Christianity, it still becomes an unwanted and unnecessary distraction. He also has a rather unique definition of prayer which he uses often when a more accurate word for what he proposes would be meditation or self-hypnosis. He also mentions nothing about the corresponding brainwave states - in this case alpha and theta - which relate to the proper mental state for self-healing. Finally, he looses what little credibility he has left with his useof infomercial-like \\"carny\\" sales technics. Phrases like, \\"Get the promotion you want...\\", and Miracles will happen to you, too...\\" make the book sound more like a Robert Tilton fundamentalist pep rally than a useful strategy for improving your life. If you're interested in this subject, I would recommend any of Ken Wilber's books, particularly, \\"The Simple Feeling of Being\\". Ken's books are extremely useful and don't insult your intelligence like Dr. Murphy's does.
0788812408|5|I think that every girl who grew up in the U.K. within the years of 1980-1995 should absolutly love this movie.  It's a classic!  I love this movie a lot and i hope you do, too!
0618918248|5|I've read quite a few people telling Dawkins to \\"stick with science, and stay away from philosophy\\" when it comes to this book. Personally, I don't really see it as all that philosophical; in fact, it seems to be based in logic with examples to back up his points, as well as some scientific explanations if necessary.    I would like to point out that if you don't understand or appreciate irony, you may find some parts confusing or irritating; -- I find such humour entertaining, and so have no complaints there. There was also some swearing, but I think they were all quotes; I only mention this for those that are offended by \\"bad words\\" in general. There were some quite grotesque things as well, pretty much entirely from the Bible, hate mail, or quotes.    I think many people, particularly Christians, would benefit from reading this. Unfortunately, many Christians that need to read this won't. But his target audience is right on the mark: Either those that already agree with him in general (such as myself) or those that were brought up in a certain religion and were unaware there was even a question against it, and are interested in reading on, rather than sticking to lackadaisical practices.    I gave the book 5/5 stars, but there were a few things I did not like, but it could just be nit-picking, and definitely didn't warrant marking the rating down, unless by half or less:    <!-- Spoilers ahead -->    (1) His definition of \\"agnostic\\": Dawkins says there is \\"TAP agnosticism\\" (temporary agnosticism in practice) and \\"PAP agnosticism\\" (permanent agnosticism in principle).    Firstly, it's just confusing to use \\"TAP\\" and \\"PAP\\" which are very similar (regardless of whether it was for humour or not), but also because no agnostic actually uses these terms, regardless of whether they're TAP or PAP agnostics. I know many works can create terms that then are used for clarification purposes in the future or in popular culture, but I think this is unlikely to be one of them, specifically because most people that call themselves \\"agnostic\\" as their stance on whether a god or gods exist or not are actually, more often than not, just ignorant of what \\"atheist/atheism\\" mean.    It would have been easier to say \\"original agnosticism\\" and \\"modern agnosticism,\\" or something similar. Agnosticism by its original meaning is that we can't know or don't know something, and has zero to do with a god, which is why we need to say \\"agnostic atheist\\" or \\"agnostic theist\\" (he comes up with a scale from 1 to 7, gnostic theist to gnostic atheist, for this). Modern agnosticism is more of an \\"on the fence\\" position, often only because they seem to think \\"atheist/atheism\\" says, \\"There is no god!\\" when it does no such thing on its own.    I'm sure Dawkins knows what both usages are, what they mean, and all of that, but I think he dressed them up and explained them in an awkward, roundabout manner.    (2) In chapter two, Dawkins says, \\"Any creationist lawyer who got me on the stand could instantly win over the jury simply by asking me: 'Has your knowledge of evolution influenced you in the direction of becoming an atheist?' I would have to answer yes and, at one stroke, I would have lost the jury.\\"    Again, maybe this is nit-picking, but it bothers me that he didn't make the distinction that, even if evolution were wrong, that would not indicate there is a god. He thoroughly describes this when he talks of \\"God of the Gaps\\" later on, but it just seems to me that it could be mistaken for \\"Dawkins does not believe in a god because he believes in evolution,\\" -- which is obviously not true, but I can see many short-sighted readers seeing this and saying, \\"I will disprove evolution, and then I will get Dawkins!\\" -- Which, of course, they do anyway; we just don't need to provide them with any more reasons to.    (3) The Unmoved Mover theory was attributed to Thomas Aquinas, but it's actually Aristotle's. I'm assuming Dawkins is aware of this, but I felt it lacking when this wasn't pointed out, though he pointed out some other similar things elsewhere.    (4) He had a slight rant, -- actually, a rather long one, -- about not teaching children the beliefs of the parents because they are too young to make up their minds: I can't see this changing the minds of many people, particularly religious people. Personally, I would teach children to use logic and to educate themselves, but that is because I see it as the best way for them, and people in general, and I have no religion or god, and therefore find it would be quite easy to do so. But, for someone very religious, the idea of not teaching their child their religion would be absurd. Whether they truly believe the religion or are in denial, they would see this logic as beyond faulty; if they didn't teach their child their religion, it could be damning them to hell, or something else just as terrible. Aren't we all just passing on the knowledge we think right or most important? Wouldn't Dawkins be doing the very same? Wouldn't anybody?    So, yes, perhaps they're technicalities, maybe I'm being anal, but this is small in terms of the book as a whole, which I think to be well-written, logical, ironic, and filled with some interesting facts and theories that I was unaware of prior to this: Usually tidbits here and there, -- why a moth is driven to the flame, &c. -- but I was particularly interested in cargo cults and John Frum, the section called \\"Love Thy Neighbour\\" in chapter seven explaining that it was not very likely the admirable laws in the Bible actually included everybody, but rather just the in-group (the Jews), and the suggestion that bats \\"see\\" colours with their ears and similar perceptions unimaginable to us in our limited world view.    <!-- End spoilers -->    I should point out that I actually listened to the audiobook in favour of multi-tasking, so I will comment on that also: It is read by Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward. It was at first very awkward: I thought it would be Dawkins reading the book, and Ward reading the quotes (which would have been preferable), but then it turned out they took turns doing this, and it was strange and a bit annoying. But, after a while, it was something I hardly noticed. Other than that, the only thing I have to say is that if you have a difficult time understanding sarcasm in written words, you may find it more beneficial to listen to the audiobook.
B008P1EWIM|5|i like the way it pulls up so fast and the detailed info. my go to when I need weather info.  great!
B007FEFLTO|5|In my eyes, Ken Follett can do no wrong.  Winter of the World is yet another Follett masterpiece, sweeping you through a horrific time in history from many different points of view.  I can't wait till the next book in this trilogy comes out and, in fact, I have pre-ordered it. I'm just sad I have to wait till the next one!
B00HN1SVFU|5|The latest installment of Thor does NOT disappoint. As a person who is moving toward not buying hard copies, I found this a great alternative. If you like all the Marvel series and Thor, you will love this. The ending will lead right into the opening for the next sequel. The LONG set of extras at the end are a particular treat. I am VERY happy with this purchase. Watching it on my Roku!
B001F63D66|5|Great, hilarious, sexy, and clever I absolutely love this movie.At first I was unsure, but as the minutes started to go by the better the movie got. Definitely want to watch it again and again. Not the best to watch with kids around.

B000OPPSXK|5|I first heard Krips conduct when he led the NY Phil in a Beethoven cycle in the summer of the late 1950's. I was hooked but good. The performances were cerebral and emotional. Needless to say, I purchased the LPs on Everest and later the CDs.<br /><br />This led me to explore Krips conducting other great music of the classical period. I bought the later Mozart on LP and was really happy. It was not Szell-Cleveland, but Krips brought out new feeling. Once again, Krips was thoughtful with emotion.<br /><br />When I saw this reissue coupling earlier works on 6 CDs it was a no brainer. Krips proved himself as much a master of Mozart symphonies as the Beethoven conductor I listened to in a week of rapture in Lewison Stadium.<br /><br />If you read this far, BUY THIS SET.

Both of us have had the movie memorized for a very long time but still love it!! (Who else wouldnt love Will Smith dressed as a cowboy????? YUMMY!!!!!) Mom kept &#34;forgetting&#34; to bring that one back and I kept picking on her about it. When she got back from the lastest cruise, I had her own copy waiting for her!!! She's been back for about a month and she just changed the movie in the player. LOL

B000FVQM2Y|2|Yes I will agree that Brick is clever and engaging to a point, but what point? I wanted to love Brick after all I'd heard but now I'm left just wanting so much more and that's too bad. People who had a gripe about this movie spoke about the dialogue delivery coming from these ultra suburban teens but my problem with this little almost gem didn't lie there, in fact that \\"hook\\" as it were, had to be the film's best edge. What I didn't like was the feeling of a hundred films being welded together as one, but never truly extracting anything of real value from any of the movies it tries to emulate. The result is a fragmented sickly feeling empty storyline filled with the main character (played by Levitt) being beaten senseless at every turn. so the bottom line here is that maybe some other directors should try out this magnificent approach, but inject it with a little more coherent storytelling. A hook is only a hook. Once you have it, the rest of the movie needs to fall into place, not fall apart. Originality:3.5 acting: 4 story:1 believability: 2 direction 4.25 rewatchability: 1 overall score:2.5
B007FG9LIE|5|I enjoyed reading this book immensely and just couldn't put it down. The mystery and suspense is both compelling and gripping. The conclusion unpredictable and chilling. Although there were times in the first 3/4 of the book where I thought why didn't our protagonist try this or that, nothing can subtract from the thrill of this book.<br /><br />This horror thriller is a must read for fans of the genre!
1843118858|5|SUPERB OVERVIEW AND GUIDANCE ON THE ISM CODE: A MUST-HAVE PURCHASE FOR SHIPPING LAWYERS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Maritime safety is the aim of the ISM Code – (International Safety Management Code) -- which every practitioner involved in shipping matters should know about.  The Code came into force in July1998 and occasioned the publication of the first edition of this book.<br /><br />It was duly noted when the first edition was published, that the Code was one of the most important developments in maritime safety to be put in place during the decade of the nineties. (And we all remember the Exxon Valdez disaster of the early nineties). The Code is now mandatory for almost every commercial vessel in the world.<br /><br />Previous attempts to improve safety and prevent pollution had focused largely on the construction of ships and their equipment.  The ISM Code by contrast, concentrates on the way shipping companies and ship operators are run, as many accidents at sea are fundamentally the fault of management.  As the ISM Code is basically about good governance, the aim of this book is to help companies achieve increased, or rather, total IMS compliance.<br /><br />The author, Professor Phil Anderson, has been an ISM Code expert witness and/or marine consultant in nearly 150 legal cases around the world where compliance was an issue. Some of the cases were criminal prosecutions; others were civil law actions often resulting from navigational accidents, collisions, personal injuries, pollution incidents and contractual disputes, with subsequent or consequent challenges by insurance companies.<br /><br />Anderson then goes on to explain why it is -- in view of the 150 cases he refers to -- that so few cases have come before the courts, which is obviously why there is so little case law available in this area. One reason is that many cases went before an arbitration tribunal.  Another is that the majority were settled out of court.<br /><br />The book of course provides all the relevant details which shipping lawyers will certainly find enlightening.  It covers, for example, the underlying principles of the ISM Code, the key players and the compliance requirements themselves, together with their legal and insurance implications.  Concerning issues which are still the subject of debate, Anderson has made it clear that the opinions which he believes to be correct are specifically his own.<br /><br />Published by Informa Law from Routledge, the Taylor & Francis Group, as part of their ‘Lloyds Practical Shipping Guides’ series, this book, written by an experienced expert in his field, offers a clear and clearly written approach to this often complex subject and thus fills an important gap in the current literature on matters relating to the ISM Code.<br /><br />For shipping lawyers and others professionally involved in matters of maritime safety, this book is an important purchase particularly in this latest edition, in view of the many amendments to the ISM Code and other developments that have taken place since the publication of the second edition in 2005.<br /><br />The publication date is cited as at 2015.s that the majority were settled out of court.<br /><br />The book of course provides all the relevant details which shipping lawyers will certainly find enlightening.

1594633665|5|I absolutely loved this book.  I usually can figure out who did it, but this time I never dreamed Tom did it.  Loved it.
0385338082|5|I hated the \\"Shop-o-holic\\" books, so I thought I was hate this one, as well. Someone recommended it to me, so I got it from the library. I LOVED IT!!! I ended up staying up all night to finish it. The main character is likable and sympathetic. The hero is dashing and sexy. The side characters are fun to read. A lot of books claim to be the next \\"Bridget Jones\\" but this is one of the few that can actually be put in that category. Not to be missed!!
B009CREQJS|4|Just don't accidentally buy the [clean] version. Billie Joe drops the f-bomb quite a bit, which is fine with me, but on the clean version, the editing is distracting. As far as the music goes, it isn't like either of the last two albums as far as being a so-called \\"rock opera\\", but it's not supposed to be. It is a bit similar in sound, and my teenage son and I ended up in a long discussion about whether or not this and the next two albums might just be stuff that didn't work with the last two. Overall, we enjoyed it.
0671034065|5|This is a great book! Earthy, sexy, and fast reading. Jaine Bright and three of her co-worker women friends sit around a restaurant table and  wonder what each thinks would be &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot;.  They make up a  list which includes personal traits and also physical traits!  This is a  joking matter to them and becomes known as &quot;The List&quot;.  Although  they had wanted to keep it private, the list is inadvertenly leaked and the  four women are suddenly thrown into the public spotlight including tv  appearances.   However, there is one twisted mind that seethes at these  women making up such a list.  This mind believes they must pay for the  disgusting things found on this list.  The list then no longer is a joke,  but a deadly game with a murderer on their track. Quick witted talk between  Jaine and her hunky next- door -neighbor cop, Sam, is delightful. Of  course, Sam becomes involved in the case and Jaine drools over the day when  they can hop into bed together!.  A must read for all Linda Howard fans.
B00785P2QC|5|it is amazing! I recommend it for anyone who likes city building games! I playnthis game all the time! it is about the only game I play!
1934030198|3|If you're a recreational triathlete who just likes to train and doesn't want the sport to take over your life, don't get this book. I think this is written more for coaches and serious triathletes. I like to do Xterras, have some fun, and get outside. This book reads like a text for a college course. I expected it to be more accessible.
B004SJ3BCI|5|it is a very intrigging game and time passes way to quick when i play I love it and so does my husband

B000JK8OYU|5|After listening to the results of the Martins work on these recordings, and thoroughly enjoying the new life breathed into them, my only thought was, \\"Man, it's time to have the whole catalog redone.\\" With the announcement of these coming out on 9.09.09, I am one happy fan. My wish has come true. To all Beatle fans, the lads are back! It been a Hard Day's Night and a Long and Winding Road, but Here Comes the Sun, so don't be a Nowhere Man and miss out. Come Together, buy a Ticket to Ride and even if it takes Eight Days A Week, revel in the greatness of this music. I Will.
6305841861|5|ED2 has got to be one of the baddest, coolest Horror flick ever!<BR>Bruce Cambell kicks ass in this movie!  <br />The DVD is good too.  But the movie was what you're looking for.<BR>Im not gonna explain the story but I will say this is a very UNDERRATED FLICK!  The story is original and the acters are pretty good.  <br />It's much more funny than scary.<br />But a word of warning: This film is brutaly violent.  Just watch when Ash has to sacrafice his arm and you'll know what I mean.<br />This is an over all Awesome flick to watch at home with the lights off.  I personaly enjoyed this better than the first.  This is also one of my favorite horror flicks.<br />GET IT!!<br />Later.....

B00004T9UF|5|This album is great.  It really shows off his talent, as does the 1st album, the Slim Shady LP.  Marshall Mathers LP is a lot angrier than his 1st LP, which really adds to the album.  There isn't as much talk about  drugs as the 1st album.  The best song on the album without a doubt is  Stan, about a crazed fan who only wants to be with him.

B00006J9OV|4|Aproppriated scenarios,excelent singers,a good music making by Levine and almost all singers.. However,as some people say  Haydn's bad luck was to be Mozart's contemporary,we could say  many conductors ,in some works,are not comfortable to be contemporary of Karajan,forgive me those who hate the idiosyncrasy and vanity by the Austrian conductor.His recording of Parsifal,despite uneven P Hoffmann,has an orchestral texture reaching a matchless supernatural rapture,a difficult concentration on the adagios and a heavenly athmosphere in the \\"eucharistic\\" moments,so that every other version seems to lack some sublimity,although they would be excellent once we did not know Karajan`s recording.  Flavio J.Morsch , Brazil
B00CH3DBNQ|5|A must read for all. Everyone says that about books they like. This is different. It does not point out one religion being right or wrong. It does not point out the atrocity of following false leaders. It points out the empowerment of education and what havoc lack of it can reek. It encourages the flames of bravery within each of us to speak up about injustices. Once I saw what she sacrificed, I could not help but be appalled at my own lack of voice in even small injustices lived out around me daily. It is inspiring to say the least. Life changing to say the most. Buy it, read it. Her voice will help you find yours.

B00CS65JS2|5|Coming into this album, I was not a Daft Punk fan, per se.  I own the Tron Soundtrack, which I believed made the movie.  At best, I was a peripheral fan.  With Random Access Memories, they have won me over.  This album is 10/10.  Perfect.  So good.  Seriously, I don't own speakers worthy of playing this music.

B0073LWEXK|3|The Lost City was a good game.  The visuals are nicely designed and the game puzzles are easy to solve.  The game is sort of escape from dungeon where you wake up and have to solve puzzles, explore rooms and interact with stuff to escape.  Given that it was free, I'd recommend this game to try once.
B007UXSPK2|5|Very exciting movie.  One of the best of Mission Impossible films. The action sequences were very Challenging and interesting, especially sice Tom Cruze  did his own stunts.
B0002ZMJ5M|5|A blend of old and new songs....all recorded new for this album. I found myself loving eevry song. Ian's voice is really good and you can tell he cared to make this as strong a personal performance as possible. This is one of those \\"solo\\" Ian projects that had the rest of the band chip in later. No matter, as with any good Tull album, it starts and end with the quality of Mr. Anderson's voice, flute and accoustic guitar, and then gets the \\"warm wrapper\\" from Matin and Co. A must have Tull album - don't let the title turn you off - the theme is Christmas - and it'a a little better with JT.
B001AQT0UY|5|\\"Gremlins\\" is one of the great guilty pleasures of motion pictures. It's an absolute classic, tremendous fun every time you watch it. As one reviewer said, it's \\"a hoot\\".<br /><br />Though \\"Gremlins\\" comes across as a perverse take on the holiday cheer of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" (the dis-connection is explicitly made within the film), one cannot overlook \\"Forbidden Planet\\". Just as the \\"Great Machine\\" allowed the Krells' inner demons to take physical form, so are the gremlins a representation of our normally suppressed murderous impulses. Otherwise, why would Billy Peltzer * be so careless about the rules?<br /><br />This is not as much of an interpretive stretch as it seems. Most of the scenes in which the \\"bad\\" or unlikeable characters are punished or killed were removed from the final cut. Mrs. Deagle (the film's equivalent of Old Man Potter) is murdered in a grotesquely comic manner, but the scene which \\"justifies\\" her offing (she's forcing the bank to foreclose properties on which a chemical plant will be built) was deleted. (Though the director's desire to keep the film moving along is justifiable, most of these scenes should have been restored for home video.)<br /><br />In Renoir's \\"Boudu Saved from Drowning\\", the title character is another \\"id monster\\" whose animal presence utterly disrupts a middle-class family. There's little doubt that Stripe blowing his nose on the curtains is an homage to Boudu wiping his shoes with a satin bedsheet.<br /><br />\\"Gremlins\\" also has an element of Hitchcockian voyeurism. One of the film's \\"pleasures\\" is watching punishment meted out to those deserving it, through an agency (the gremlins) whose behavior we are not responsible for. Our \\"murdering id\\" can be vicariously gratified without legal or moral consequences.<br /><br />\\"Gremlins\\" anticipates films like \\"Puppet Master\\", \\"Hostel\\", and \\"Saw\\", which tittillate the audience with scenes of people being murdered or mutilated in a graphic, detailed fashion. **<br /><br />\\"Gremlins\\"' iconic scene, in which Billy's mother kills three of the gremlins -- by grinding up one in a mixer, stabbing another repeatedly, and (classically) blowing up one in a microwave oven -- was the one that most aroused audiences (both pro and con), as it cuts close to the bone of how we would /sometimes/ like to handle our personal problems. Mrs. Peltzer isn't killing rats -- the gremlins are sentient, consciously malicious beings. Like, your boss, maybe?<br /><br />In the running commentary, Joe Dante remarks several times that, had CGI been available, \\"Gremlins\\" would have been an altogether different film. Indeed. One of the film's charms is the audience's awareness that it is watching fur-and-rubber puppets \\"live\\" on the soundstage, performing an especially nasty \\"Punch & Judy\\" show.

B008Y2FRFO|1|Kind of gets boring after a while
B00005UK1F|5|I have been an avid lover of progressive/concept rock for over 30 years, especially long tunes, but I do not know how I missed this epic song by Green Carnation for over 10 years since its first release. I came across it accidentally when I googled \\"long progressive rock songs\\". Usually, I am not lacking of words, but I cannot find the proper words to describe this phenomenal composition. You have in this one song a fusion of Pink Floyd, Genesis, ELP, Yes, Black Sabbath, and ambient New Age. Whatever your taste in progressive rock, you'll find it here somewhere.<br /><br />The song starts off gently with playful baby sounds in the background. Gradually the soft melody builds up to a crescendo of sustained eruptions of drums, guitar, and grunge vocals. We have this pattern repeated throughout the 60 minutes length of the song. Except that it's a different, highly appealing melody each time, each rhythm rising and falling in a beautiful weaving consistency. The transitions are also seamless.<br /><br />Then at about 34 minutes into the song, we are treated to a lovely solo, the haunting wailing of a woman in deep lamentation. Listen in silence and you journey with her in painful agony as her \\"ooooohs\\" and \\"aaaaahs\\" rise to the highest pitch, and fall to the deepest depth of her very soul, to the equally melancholic weave of a horn. This section lasts for about 5 minutes, but you don't feel the passage of time. Instead you emerge from it in harmony with her painful emotions.<br /><br />Towards the end at about 56 minutes, the song becomes more upbeat and you almost feel an emergence from darkness into light, like a triumphant return home from a long uncertain journey. The last minute is once again the sounds of a playful baby mingled with the soft rhythmic melody of baby toys.<br /><br />Ever since I discovered \\"Light of Day, Day of Darkness\\" less than a week ago, I have listened to this 60 minute song entirely and repeatedly everywhere - in the car, at home, at work,and while running in the park. Each time, it ends too soon, like a 3 minute song.<br /><br />I have wondered what inspired Green Carnation to produce this masterpiece, especially considering they have not had any significant production before or after. However, I command you to go out and get this music now, if you have not already.<br /><br />I need not say more.
B00G3L6KQI|5|As always deborah Harkness has hit it out of the ball park.  Although a long book it was easy readings.  Yes, sometimes she gets too technical on the witchery stuff but you care about her characters.  Most of all you want to know how the twins turn out in her next book.  Part vamp part witch, now that's a heady combination.
B0009XRZ9M|4|Me and my family watch this movie every Christmas. This has been a tradition we do every year. This movie is great for all ages.
B00785P2QC|5|This is a fun game and easy to navigate.<br />This game reminds me of Sim city and other similar games.
B0054JZC6E|5|great app tons of fun! stayed up for hours playing it . I cant put it down. I would highly reccomend
B00JSBVDBC|3|One of the music choices is so annoying it'll drive you crazy.  Repetitive ridiculous and frustrated you cannot change or delete it.
B008602KQI|5|I loved the service in providing me with this video.  Watched it twice now and loved the movie.  Tastefully done. It did not just go for the gore.

0440243661|4|With BAD LUCK AND TROUBLE Lee Child takes our 6 foot five inch 250 pound Robin Hood out for a run with his Not Always Merry Men and Women, this time for revenge against one or more of their own. While I have a problem with the notion of an Army unit being made up solely (or nearly solely) of officers...eh, and properly functioning, I like Jack Reacher's people none-the-less. A pity a few more of them couldn't have been enlisted men or women because the Army likes to say that Sergeants are the backbone of the Army. We former Sergeants like to believe that occasionally some of the officers were a little further down. In the real world it's the enlisted folk that make the Infantry work, that load and fire canons for the Artillery, that make helicopters and airplanes fly, that make better coffee in the morning, better snide remarks during the long work day, and well, you get the picture. Also, there is no 81st Airborne...82nd sure, 101st okay but no 81st...small nits, little pick.<br />  The fact is Lee Child has a good character with Jack Reacher and a good character for the times and come on, folks...who doesn't like to see the good guys win in a manner that befits the crime. Add a Lee Child novel to your reading list. The books, this one included, are well done thrillers and whodunnits.
B007IXWL2C|5|I wish you would write the same books but from his point of view I read all the books twice I could not put them down please please write another book
B00HZ3C4N6|3|Started off really slow but picked up and got better
B000B7HZXM|5|Excellent
B00FVVR2ZO|4|Lots of excitement and many rooms and locations to explore.<br />You may think it's easy but the game becomes more intriguing and challenging<br />As you progress.  The characters  are so interesting and colorful. You must try it at least once.<br />DCI Stina
B0064NTZJO|4|I was all psyched to see this in the theater. The trailers made me believe it was going to be a movie about a boy and his GT. I was hoping for lots of driving and V8's rumbling my seats. Not to give too much away, but there isn't a lot of that in this movie. One of the chase scenes felt like an \\"homage\\" to Bullitt, that was a bit of a dud for me. I left the theater thinking, \\"meh.\\" It wasn't what I expected.<br /><br />But something about that movie did stick with me. The cinematography was good, the music stands out, and there was a great chemistry between Driver and Irene. Plus, there's a major cool factor with this movie. He doesn't have to say much, he's just a bad ass.<br /><br />If you sit down to this movie with expectations of tons of car chases, you're going to be dissapointed. Watch it with an open mind and you'll want to see it again. That's why I ordered it, can't wait to watch it again.
B00BJ9VBLI|5|Great game worth the money
B005D9MUWY|4|I read about this software and it had good reviews. However, I don't really enjoy texting so much, so I didn't buy it.  Then, I saw it for free and I just had to try it.  The word suggestions are very good. It also has the ability to be used like the Swype keyboard. I like it
B00FXMECS6|5|The RED cast if back and funnier. Rated PG-13, the violence is even amusing in spots.  Frank and Marvin have their hands full with Sarah's enthusiasm for being part of the action.<br />The stage is set.  I hope for a RED 3.
B00005JKHP|5|Always wanted to buy it ! Some people thought it was boring but I really loved it. Everyone looked young and the story was great !
B0001611DI|5|This review is of the single disc, Divimax Edition from Anchor Bay.  I had never seen this movie before and my wife and I are fans of zombie movies, so we threw this in with a bunch of movies we bought for the Halloween weekend. We didn't really know what to expect from it, other than we knew it is a cult classic. During the opening scenes, there were two things that were evident. One, the movie looks like it was filmed last week! Beautiful! The other, we thought maybe we had made a mistake because of the way the movie opens with a bunch of hectic scenes. Those fears soon subsided as the story starts to get going and we learn who the characters are that we are supposed to care about. Other than the odd opening, I'd have to say that this is my all-time favorite zombie movie, by far. But it's the quality of the remaster that really impressed me. The only movies I've seen that look this good for their age are the frame-by-frame remasters of the James Bond series. It was really hard to believe that this was a movie from 1978. It's about as close as you can get to going back in time. If you like zombie movies and haven't seen this one, you need to see it. NOW! :) This version's quality far outweighs its price.
B00BETX5PS|5|Great movie! I loved the retro Astin Martin and theme music. Lots of fun! James Bond has seldom been better. Excellent Bond villain too!
B0064TVQ5E|5|I love the challenge of the game. It is a very interesting and I am now trying it for the first time.
B00H4M3GXK|4|Very good story and the acting was good as well.
B00A9ET4MC|5|So well written.  Long time since a book left me thinking so deeply.  Everyone should read this book.  Just wonderful.
B002QE3CTY|5|this book was easily the best book I've read in a long time! I could not put it down, It kept me constantly turning pages. The plot was twisted and never let me down. I have and will continue to recomend this book to my friends.
B00CDV6WDS|5|The game is great with good graphics.  I can play for hours.  It is a great stress reliever.  Please add more layouts and tiles!
B000YHG72E|5|Anything with Will Ferrell is phenomenal!  Funny and it has a nice message to it too.  Definitely a must see!
B000GG4Y32|4|Well written, overly self-indulgent in its direction.
B003Y74AZ2|3|This fits a little loose.  Nice cover, but it will slip a bit coming out of or into a pocket.
B00FZRMIYY|5|When I listen to this recording, I feel at peace.  It is not overbearing or pop oriented.  Rosanne has very deep messages that hit home.
B004H4XDBI|4|I really love how it continues the story and tell a about what happens after mia stays. I could not put the book down!! if you loved the first you must read the second!
059035342X|4|A Review By Kory<BR>A young boy, Harry Potter lives on Privet Drive with his aunt, uncle, and cousin. His mother and father died from a black magic wizard named Voldemort, even though he was told they died in a car crash. Harry is sent many letters by a school called Hogwarts School of Wizardry, which he is not allowed to read because his uncle treats him very unfairly. The family goes to a secluded house out by the beach thinking no one would find Harry there, but Hagrid comes to Harry's rescue, and later takes him to Hogwarts where Harry meets many new friends on the way.<br />This story was very fun to read. I really liked the way the author laid everything out in the story, and made the story very suspenseful yet adventurous at the same time. I also enjoyed how Harry and Hagrid became good friends and they were always there for each other. During the beginning of the story Harry had a very rough childhood having no parents and having to leave with his horrible aunt and uncle. Harry finds out around the middle of the story that he is one of the most well known wizards alive, because he was the only person strong enough to live through Voldemorts powers. Harry notices that someone is trying to take the \\"whatever\\" Fluffy the three-legged dog is guarding, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione go on an adventure of there own.<br />I would strongly recommend this book to almost anyone. It is a very fun and adventurous book with all kinds of curves. The reading isn't the easiest, but definitely not horribly hard. I am definitely going to read the second Harry Potter and hopefully read the rest.
B007REV4YI|4|Experience OK
B00EHMFC78|4|This is a great read.  The action is fantastic and Baldacci's ability to combine several stories to create one continuous novel is beyond compare.
B001AQO3WY|5|I have to say, I watched this series in the summer when it came out and i was hooked on it. I was so impressed with it, just the way it was filmed made it feel real. Another great series by HBO.

B00DJFIMW6|5|Much better than the other version. I love it
B0000844IT|5|ARMY OF DARKNESS is the third entry in Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD TRILOGY. It is a great comedy that mixes genres and has some of the best one liners in cinema history. This BOOMSTICK EDITION is the 1,000 time the film has been on DVD and is the definitive version. Here are the bonus materials:<BR>-Director's Cut: Along with the original theatrical version is the director's cut which runs 15 minutes longer. Of the two, I prefer the theatrical version. Although I love the alternate ending in the director's cut, I think the humor in the theatrical ending is more in tune with the rest of the film. The other added scenes are good but the final battle now goes on far too long with there being long periods of no laughs or even interesting action.<BR>-Commentary (only on director's cut): By Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Ivan Raimi. A very funny and informative track.<BR>-Featurette: A good featurette that goes into the makeup and monster FX of the movie. Although it would've been better as a full documentary.<BR>-Deleted Scenes (with optional commentary): Some good scenes that should've been in the director's cut but might've brought down the pace of the film.<BR>-Storyboards: You can view the director's storyboards as you watch the film.<BR>-Photo Gallery: Concepts of the monsters.<BR>-Trailer: A very funny trailer.<BR>  Also included is a booklet written by Bruce Campbell, making this one of the best horror/cult movie releases on DVD.
B003TJR2HS|5|I bought this because my Pioneer nav unit charge cable didn't fit anymore when I got a new iSkin case for my iPhone4. The charge port opening on the iSkin case was just a hair too small, and the cable's connector was a bit too thick to stay connected. This adapter worked perfectly. It is the same thickness as a standard Apple charge connector, and fits really securely to both the nav unit cable and the phone. I leave it connected to the nav unit cable, and just connect my phone when I need to charge it.<br /><br />I did not have any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers of the fit on the phone end being too tight - it is just right. I do not have any problems with nav unit controls - everything worked exactly as it does without the extender. Great find--thanks, CableJive!
B00004XPOZ|5|SPOILERS AHEAD<BR>This Episode ties all the loose ends left from &quot;A New Hope&quot; and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, with the best special effects of the Trilogy, and maybe of all Sci-Fi movies. Personally, I love the fact that Darth Vader, my favorite character in motion picture history, turns good, and that his spirit(as Anakin)can be seen at the victory celebration alonside the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda. The ending is just perfect.<BR>Also, the music is the best from the Trilogy, adding depth to the characters and underscoring their development. Arguably, John Williams did his best work here.<BR>Anyway, this should have been the last Star Wars movie, so that people could remember this series as the greatest achievement in cinema history, and the greatest story ever told.
B00OKYQZDI|4|Highly additive and fun game. Good way to clear the mind. I would like to have more opportunities to &#34;earn&#34;bonuses within the game.
B007B6VOG0|5|It has been a awhile since I have bought an album that I just want to listen to on repeat, I love the classic rock feel.  I enjoy the fact that the band's role is just as important and incorporated with the music as Nate's awesome voice. Also the fact that each song has an idividual feel with the album is not monotone. I generally do not like autotune, due to the fact that I think musicians are using it more as a crutch versus enhancing the talent that they have, but Fun. does it right.<br /><br />Wish I would have found thier music sooner and I am excited to see how their sound will evolve in the future.
6304140711|4|This movie rocks!! It has a good plot, story, and interesting characters. If you liked Fatal Attraction, then you'll love this! It's got a lot of thrills, suspense, and some very harrowing moments, especially the showdown at the family nest! Sometimes the film gets a bit boring, but delivers one heck of a thriller! The rollercoaster scene is very steamy! The performances are very convincing. Fatal Attraction is still just a little bit better, but this movie still kicks butt!!
B003VANOFY|1|[[VIDEOID:mo3MVCBK84TWVZI]]The g930 is actually an awesome headset. The design is great, listening to music is crisp & clear, wireless is now a luxury I won't be able to live without, and these could very well be the best headphones I've ever had.    However, there is a major problem plaguing this headset, and while it could most likely be fixed with a simple driver update, sadly logitech just doesn't seem to care...    The deal breaker occurs when using the mic, there is a constant buzzing/interference sound.  It doesn't matter if it is completely silent when I'm recording, the sound won't go away!  Doesn't matter if I'm using the logitech drivers, or windows default drivers, laptop or desktop, doesn't matter if I'm on Win XP machine, or Vista...    If you browse their support forums you will this is a rampant problem with everyone who owns the g930.  And you'll also see that support is pretty much non-existent too.  Such a shame, I would love them except for this one issue, and these headphones are now going back...
B00IJJUIMY|5|Another great book from MIchael Connelly. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK. Always great story lines. Hope we don't have to wait to long for the next book.
0515123447|5|I enjoy Lee Child's writing style and I appreciated his unconventional hero, a guy who is true to his upbringing and training and doesn't waste time moralizing or wallowing in self-doubt.  This book is a page turner, I stayed up way past midnight reading it and only reason I put it down is because I couldn't focus any longer on the page.  I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; books.  This book is for you if you've also enjoyed the following:  Bourne Identity, Without Remorse, Point of Impact (and all Bob Lee Swagger stories), J. Maxim's Bannerman series, Daniel Silva's Gabrial Allon, or Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series.
B004LQI0QK|4|Good army movie to watch on a rainy day!
B001QB9H10|3|I have already seen the movie several times, so the content was what I expected.  I just wanted it around so I could view it whenever I liked
B008JFUPK8|4|Once upon a time &#34;SuperMan&#34; was a comicbook hero and a television series, one aimed at the younger crowd and the other tried to find a broader audience. Then came another series, and then another.  They are all different in presentation and details, but none had the punch that this one has. This is the &#34;what if&#34; version, to me anyway - what if he was really tormented and life was really tough? What if he was pushed just a bit further? Well - here we see it.<br /><br />Well done - quite intense, and yet it's the first movie that gave me any reason to give a darn about Clark Kent other than a super hero. Here we have reason to look into the issue of choice, consideration, and bonds that form between people.

0446691437|5|I generally avoid self-help books like the plague, especially the ones with the smug author on the dustcover grinning like an idiot. But this one is in a class of its own, and the only self-help book you will ever need. The reason is that, unlike all the other books which specialize in obstacles in a specific area, this one gets to the root of EVERYTHING that goes wrong when we try to explore an artistic impulse, resolve to make the world a better place, embark on a diet or exercise regimen, etc. The reason for our frustration in these areas is that they all involve what Stephen Pressfield calls Resistance: a force which ironically comes from deep inside us and that tries to prevent us from actualizing our potential, whatever that may be.<br /><br />The first part of the book describes the characteristics of Resistance in detail. While it may sound like yet another piece of psycho-analytic mumbo-jumbo, Pressfield's analysis rings truer than anything else I've read as an explanation for why we are thwarted in our endeavors. The second part outlines Pressfield's solution for overcoming Resistance: what he calls 'going pro'. Professionals, unlike amateurs, play for keeps. They've heard their soul's inner calling and are devoted to creating the conditions necessary for creativity to flow. Unlike people's romantic fantasies about creativity that strikes the artist when she is not looking for it, professional artists know that there is a lot of grunt work that has to take place before the Muse begins to whisper in their ear.<br /><br />Pressfield almost lost me when he started articulating the metaphysics underlying his concept of Resistance. I don't care at all for his quasi-Buddhist view of the soul and his theory of the real existence of the Muses. But the last part can be skipped over without any substantial loss. The rest of the book is just too valuable. Pressfield is an immensely talented, insightful writer who knows what he is talking about. His prose is laconic but piercing, the product of a man who has obviously 'been there' many times. He writes from the vantage point of a veteran in the struggle against Resistance. Before you take up yet again the challenge to lose 20 pounds, write that damn book or make that big change in your life, read this short, marvelous book. I guarantee that it will open your eyes and energize you to know your enemy and successfully overcome it.product of a man who has obviously 'been there' many times.

B000ESSTKQ|4|That's because Rhino is now owned by the WEA group and they don't support SACD. They could have used DVD-Audio instead, considering all the trouble they went to creating surround versions. The DTS 96/24 tracks are decent IF you have a newer 96/24 DTS decoder, otherwise you'll get 48/24 output. This same problem will plague the upcoming Genesis reissues as well, you'll only get the SACD layer if you buy the import and that means the videos will be PAL format.

And NOW they decide change the look of the box?!?!?!?! Did IQ's suddenly DROP at the company responsible??!<br /><br />I'd like to find the imbecilic MORON who ok'd this change and punch him/her in the head!!! (well...if it's a woman...I'd just yell alot!!)<br /><br />This is right up there with the DEMONS FROM HELL who release DVDs that won't let you skip over previews!!!!<br /><br />Yes...I LOVE the show and this won't change the quality of the shows contained on the discs inside but......this travesty sticks out like a sore thumb on my shelf!!!<br /><br />I'm seriously tempted to deduct a star or 2 for this screw-up, which I KNOW is about money (the new box is probably cheaper and you KNOW all the greedy demons really care about is the $$) but that wouldn't be fair to one of the best shows on TV.<br /><br />As for the show itself....what can I tell fans they don't already know? That it's back in fine form after 2 not-quite-as-good seasons? That it REALLY makes me look forward to the final season? Well..........you already know that or you don't watch the show and probably will never see this review!!

B0006A9FKA|5|I obviously don't buy movies unless I absolutely love them. This movie is awesome. I do not like scary movies, but I love this. The humor takes off the pressure. And oh, the humor. It is non-stop funny, and yet somehow very realistic. If there was a zombie epidemic, this is in fact how it would be. Enjoy.
B00AIUUXHC|5|Good game<br />This is for all you lovers of this shark game good game for children and a family that likes shark.
B008LP8QE8|3|The book is great, BUT the search option is WAY too slow. The only fast search option was with the pocket guide, but the format in that book is horrible.  Purchased both but ended up returning them. going to try the Apple iBook version.
B00EMXBDMA|5|A super page turner. Great characters and plausible happenings. Will be a great movie - alas they will probably have to slice out some superb bits.
B00BI73CVI|5|I have seen this movie twice now. I loved it even more the second time. I can't wait to watch it again. It is so full of emotion, of kindness, of the best sort of love.
B000B8IA2G|5|If you liked SG-1, you'll probably like the whole SA series. It's nice to see some of the SG-1 team pop in now and then, but we like this team and series as well.<br />Lots of interesting new characters and good plots with some humor thrown in.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|I like this game a lot I would want to be able to create your own online map. Also you should be able to tag or other fun games thanks bye.
B00ECU2SGS|4|Great acting!
B007ZYJT1U|5|Haven't seen one like this in a really long time, if ever.  Gets deep into the psyches of troubled people whose journeys intersect with hard-hitting results.  A favorite.
031606792X|5|This was my favorite book of this series.
B000069AUI|5|This is an exicting time in music isn't it?  Coldplay, White Stripes and Queens of the Stone Age give me hope in a world of Justin's, Britney's and Cristina's.<br />This album is wonderful - not so different than Parachutes but in no way repetitive.  &quot;Daylight&quot; (#6) blows me away....but the whole thing stirs deep emotions - the same way U2's &quot;October&quot; did years ago but without the politics.<br />Buy it - if you regret it then you just don;t get it!
B0064X7FVE|3|Not crazy about the format, but it gets the job done. And the weather channel is usually pretty accurate. Kept use from running for cover when we didn't need too.
B009LXEBD4|5|Nice album, quick shipping A+.
B003MC5N28|5|The kids and I read this book and loved it. It actually sparked a lot of great conversation and we touched on some important topics like -- what makes a person evil or good,  what are emotions and why are they important,  is it more important to be happy or to be free?<br /><br />There is just SO much rich parent-kid chatter-fodder in this book that you just have to read it with them and discuss.
B00008J4P5|1|I just cannot understand what all the hype is about this album.  I bought it looking for something new to listen to.  True, I grew up listening to the hair bands and rock and roll bands of the 70's and 80's, but I feel I can listen to most &quot;music&quot; out there.  This was absolute trash.  This is absolutely the first time I've ever bought an album and literally threw it away after the first time through.  Sometimes music will grow on me, but I hope that this band never does or I'll have it surgically removed!!!  Don't waste your money.  Go buy something from Incubus instead.  Now there is some real talent.
B003V4AK8E|5|First off, I never buy 3rd party controllers. However, you will get more than your moneys worth with this one. I bought 2 of these because I wanted a PS3 controller that was configured more like an XBOX Controller. It works about as good as the PS3 controller but you are not going to get any other 3rd party controller that is even close to this good for this price. The first 2 I bought wore out pretty fast because I was playing with them very heavily with Marvel Vs Capcom 3 which will put a lot of ware on them.  Amazon replaced them though and I still use them steadily but they are holding up way better now.  Bad for Fighting games, good for shooters and adventure games.  PS3 only has 2 USB ports so you can only use 2 of these at a time, they use a wireless dongle.  They will disconnect rarely, because it is not as reliable as the PS3 bluetooth controllers.
B00JDMY58Y|5|My seven year old daughter loves this special edition Barbie. The dress is not the normal clothing in style or quality. It exceeds the normal!
B0063GORYU|5|This game is so entertaining. So much fun and really helps you to focus and give your brain a work out. If recommend it highly.....
B007PTJOV0|5|My 6-year old is loving this game!  My older boy and I have found games to enjoy, but I 'm glad we finally found a game for the youngest to enjoy.
B005MJFA2W|5|It's not that often that a book falls into your hands which makes you stop and think, reassess, consider and smile in recognition, and most certainly not a book which could be considered a textbook rather than a view of life as we see it in our day-to-day lives. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is that famous exception which attempts to prove the rule that not all is as it seems. It is a textbook which appeals to the masses, written in a free-flowing and easy style which appeals, which draws the reader into ever complex ideas, into a deep spiral of realization that our lives and thoughts, our actions and reactions are not quite as simple as we may wish to believe.<br /><br />We are subjected to a vast array of situations each and every minute of the day, whether we realize it or not, which require some form of decision. Some are seemingly automatic, some require more thought. Many can change the way our life goes from one moment to the next, can alter our opinion, can bring drastic financial, emotional or other major changes depending on the information we have, the information we consider in forming our judgement. Let me give you a current example:<br />A young gay woman posts a service receipt to the Internet which shows a refusal to give a tip because the customer does not agree with her way of life.<br /><br />Many people will have immediately formed an opinion on what has happened simply from this one-sided statement, this public action. Reading through Kahneman's book, however, we get to see that our opinion is based on a lack of information, on information which has also be augmented by recent events, memories of similar actions, personal feelings. We see that our opinion is formed and accept it as such without necessarily knowing why we came to this decision, or even how. We also learn that our decision, since we have no other information than that which is contained in one statement, could well be false, formed through misinformation or a lack of appropriate information.<br /><br />Decision making based on information received is a far more complex act than many appreciate. For most it appears to be a very easy matter: we read what is presented to us and base our final reply, our actions and reactions upon what we already know coupled with what we have been given. In fact, as Kahneman points out, there are several levels involved in good decision-making, and we do not always take advantage of all the possibilities. We take, automatically, the easy way out. Sometimes we do not even address the problem at hand, but seek out a simpler, related problem which can be answered quickly, without too much thought. We do not delve into the depths of a problem, but take it at face value.<br /><br />With a wealth of examples, Kahneman takes the reader through many different scenarios covering how we think, how we make decisions, what we use to arrive at our decision and how this process can fool us. He does it, however, in a manner which is easy to understand, taking us gradually one level after the other towards the more complex problems of risk and reward. Each stage is covered with plain examples, then completed with more information, and a solid explanation of how we arrived at our first decision, how further information, even a slightly different wording of a problem, might have changed the manner in which we think, the result of our thoughts.<br /><br />Let me return to my example (above). The information we have, at first glance, is that a young gay woman has been refused a tip despite her service as a waitress. There is nothing to suggest that the level of service received by the customer was bad, their refusal to tip is based exclusively on the fact that she is gay, and they do not agree with her lifestyle. If the service was not bad, we reason, then there must be another excuse for not tipping: this is given to us. We automatically imagine a very conservative family, straight-laced, set in their ways, not in tune with modern society and the acceptance of different lifestyles, different personalities, different sexual orientation. We recall that there have been many examples in recent months of people refusing tips to waitresses for the most obscure and irrational reasons. Coupled with this, we remember that many waitresses - and other customers - have picked up the bills for others who they felt either needed financial assistance, or who had, through service to their country and fellow citizens, earned it in one form of another.<br /><br />This background knowledge influences our decision. We feel offended that anyone could refuse a tip for someone doing their job properly simply because of who they are. Some will feel the need to comment on the family involved, even though they know neither the waitress nor the other people. Some will feel the need to compensate the waitress, who has done nothing wrong. With his clear examples, Kahneman shows us that this is not unusual. We have reacted to the information presented, coupled with what we already know from elsewhere, and come to a decision. We take some form of action, even though we have very little information to go on. Our reaction requires very little thought, it is, in effect, a very shallow reaction and absolutely normal.<br /><br />What when we receive further information, though, could this change our attitude? Two more pieces of news may have reached us after we had initially reacted:<br /><br />The waitress is prone to excessive lying.<br /><br />The family concerned publish another copy of the same receipt without a handwritten comment, but with a tip.<br /><br />Our available information has been greatly enhanced, and our decision about the whole course of events changes drastically. There is more than a shadow of a doubt cast upon the original story. Our thought processes go beyond the shallow level with this new information and, in all probability, our opinion of the waitress and the family she served changes: we side with the family.<br /><br />Decision making is an everyday part of our lives, even for the smallest things. It is automatic, in most cases, and requires little apparent thought, even though our thought processes must be active. Decision making, so clear-cut and easy, is far more complicated than we had first imagined, taking more information - present, past, learned, heard-of - into account in a fraction of a second. In his highly accessible work, Kahneman takes us, one step at a time, through the thought processes involved across several different levels and shows us how we work, where, through a lack of information or just pure laziness (on the part of the mind) we might be failing ourselves, making errors which could haunt us for years to come. He brings complex psychological thought across in a factual and fascinating manner, and makes us, the reader, consider what we are doing, how we made a decision, and whether it was, after all, the right one.ne with modern society and the acceptance of different lifestyles, different personalities, different sexual orientation.

B000002JSN|5|Oh the seventies.  Its a real shame that I was born in '79.  I've been an avid rock fan for the last ten years or so and after listening to tunes from every decade its my opinion that the music was definately at its creative peak in the late sixties and early to mid seventies.  Sure its bands, even the great ones, weren't without their excesses.  And yes many times they would play long elaborate solos where short ones would do.  Plus who can forget that these bands also had to release a mandatory live album with plenty of extensive jamming and a bloated double album with more than enough filler to go around.   <br />While these criticisms are valid, it is what makes these bands so much fun to listen to.  Whether its the spacey concept albums of Pink Floyd, or the super long blues jams of the Cream and the Allman Brothers Band all these factors contributed to an era where the muscians were musicians and the music was for the fans.  Now rock is just another souless, faceless, corporate, over produced, over processed product with little if any passion.  (ok not all modern bands suck, but the great ones are fewer and farther between.) <br />Ok now to the review.  Physical Graffiti is Led Zeppelin's bloated double album with its share or filler. (boogie with stu, black country woman.)  But it is truly one of the era's great double albums.  This album is also marks a change in Zeppelin's sound.  At this point Jimmy Page was really into layering his guitar tracks.  This produced a very dense and heavy sound. <br />On the first disc we are treated to four Zep classics.  \\"The Rover,\\" has a great riff while \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" is a homage to Zep's muscle.  Bonham's drums are especially powerful on \\"Dying.\\"  \\"Trampled Underfoot\\" is exhillarating blend of funk, blues, and heavy metal.  Closing out the first disc is my personal fav from the Zep repetoire, the immortal \\"Kashmir.\\"  This song is again a showcase for a hypnotically powerful Page riff and the Bonzo thunder.  The song with its eastern influenced lyrics is complimented with an orchestra of Indian musicians.  All these factors lead to a truly epic listening experience. <br />Disc one is a powerful album in itself.  However disc two despite some of the filler has many great moments.  \\"In the Light,\\" is an underrated epic, while \\"Down By The Seaside,\\" is a dreamy ballad.  \\"The Wanton Song\\" opens with a truly powerful and funky riff.  As great as those songs are they pale in comparison to heartbroken \\"Ten Years Gone.\\"  \\"Ten Years,\\" is a perfect break up tune about regret and the feeling of emptyiness that accompanies losing someone you thought was your soul mate.  A true classic.  After some filler, the album closes with the heavy and rockin \\"Sick Again.\\"  Its a great way to close one of rock's greatest double albums.  (It is second only to the Beatles delightfully uneven White Album.)
B0052RDHTM|5|Great read
0307155102|5|Fantastic from one generation to the next!!!!!!
B009IJJ5B4|2|i really wanted to like this show, and it is just ok. I think they are trying to hard to make sherlock like a bad@ss hipster guy, and really the main thing i like about the show is Lucy Lu
B007PT3QOQ|4|I love this game, but MAN is it glitchy!
B0027BOL4G|5|I cannot believe the practices that are outlined in this movie.  How sad is it that WE as Americans trusted the FDA to do the right thing regarding our health, only to find out that AGAIN capitalism is more important than the health of the citizens of the United States of America.  I'm appauled and pissed off that this has been swept under the rug.  Not only are we suffering, our children are suffering, and dis-eases as being allowed to proliferate and kill individuals every day as a result of the processing that is taking place!    Watching the Oprah Show may have saved my life and members of my families life, it's that simple!  This FOOD SYSTEM is killing you!  Do yourself and YOUR FAMILY a favor and start shopping local.  Find local vendors and use them and stop buying and feeding your family the crap that they so arrogantly put on the market!  I know many people who have illnesses that have become RAMPANT since this processing started, going green has changed their LIFE AND THEIR HEALTH!  Think about all of the chemicals that they are using to process those meats, and the fact that you are ingesting those chemicals, and the fact that you have allergies, and the fact that you have hormonal imbalances, and the fact that you have no energy, and the fact that you have CANDIDA, and the fact that your child has a learning disability, and the fact that your hair is falling out, and the fact that your child can't control their temper, and the fact that you have fibro, ADHD, lyme disease, thyroid disorders, mental illness, constipation, gerd, etc.  That list is long and while the doctors will be happy to provide you with a prescription, the prescription that will cost you a little bit more on the front end but HAS NO SIDE EFFECTS, is ORGANIC FOODS!   Save your life today AND VOTE WITH YOUR POCKETBOOK, THREE TIMES A DAY!!!      YES, this prescription will take you more time, YES this prescription means that you have to cook EVERYTHING, yes it will get you closer to your family, YES, YES, YES, but in the long run you'll feel better so you can exercise and feel good about it and have more energy to spend with your family!:)
B00008F8HE|5|If you haven't purchased this album, you're stepping over a gem. I just love John &amp; Carlos. This is a great collaboration. What was created on this LP is magical. Great pioneers. It's a shame John gets not credit. He is one of the fastest guitar players, I've ever heard. The way he phrases is bone chilling. When I first listened to this CD, I was blown away. <br />A must have for a fan of Jazz, Rock or Fusion and someone who is studying guitar. These guys were ahead of their time.<br />Carlos &amp; John rocked this composition......<br />Nuff Said
0345803507|5|You wouldn't think a 90 year old LADY say that but I was loaned the first book and found the author very good and decided to order the next two for myself and the person who loaned me the fist one.  Good Story, Good Author and well written.
B00DYOOGYK|2|I downloaded this game for my son on his Nabi Jr, and it was constantly freezing. It was more problems then it was worth. My son loves this game but it shut down his whole tablet completely. Not a very happy customer at all. I rated it 2 stars because my son loved the game, but if your tablet doesnt have a fast enough system on it do not download because you will have nothing but a lagging game that freezes constantly. I had high hopes because it is a Gameloft game, but was extremely disappointed.

6304535570|5|There are some who say that fans of Simon Templar should not see this film, but I say that Templar fans should make up their own minds. Some detractors accuse this Saint of being unrealistic and \\"corny\\", but fans of The Saint who dislike fictional escapism and \\"corny\\" entertainment should really find a new hero. There has always been a great deal of escapism and \\"corn\\" in The Saint canon, films, radio shows, comics, and TV shows. This Saint is certainly no worse, and in many ways is far superior, to other later day Saints like Ian Ogilvy or Simon Dutton. They each had their strong points, but Val Kilmer's Templar is by far a more intriguing character. I have very little knowledge of Val Kilmer's other work, but he's engaging and entertaining in this role. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that the origin of the character is revealed for the first time. Some have said this only takes place at the start of the film, but in reality the entire film IS the origin. It includes Simon's journey from criminal to Saint. His transformation, and three \\"miracles\\", kept me hooked from start to finish.  All Simon Templar fans should give this one another look. This Saint is a damn good picture worth seeing.

B002QNTNL6|3|Cute girl, cute story.  Nothing deep here, but it is good entertainment.  Amanda Bynes kept me watching a predictable plot and made  interesting enough.
0811875555|5|This book is filled with just a small portion of all the concept art for the film, Tangled. Seeing these beautiful pieces of art just makes the film even better.<br /><br />My only complaint about the order of this book is that it took almost a month to ship, but I knew that going in. But the book is amazing and it arrived in perfect condition.
B0002OERI0|1|What kind of overrated pop band is Green Day? They are super overrated with all I hear is guitars. There is not even 1 guitar <br />solo in this album, it is just lousy. Even Boulevard Of Broken Dreams is overrated as their crappy new single. Green Day is now <br />over, stop reviewing this terrible item everyone, go hide this in the closet in your room right now.
0060736267|5|Quick delivery.  Fine condition!  Wanted to read this book for a long time - excellent read.  I'm passing it on to a friend, unless ... would you like to buy it back from me?  Just kidding!
B001ED7C58|4|Good CD but didn't have both of rob Pattinson's songs on it. Would recommend buying the CD online through Itunes.
B004DLPXAO|5|My Kindle stays at home but it is great to get the same book on my phone so if I end up waiting or just bored I can pick up right where I left off on my Kindle by this app being on my phone. then when I get back to my kindle it takes me right back to the page I left off on.
B008IJTFYW|5|This is amazing for those nights when you just can't seem to sleep. It allows you to make your own music to which you feel relaxed and it would be great if they could offer this as a computer program so that you could listen to it there as well. Just listening to this makes me feel relaxed and more at ease when I am needed just a little bit of a meditative state to help and focus through a situation. Highly recommend:)

030726999X|5|I couldn't find this 3d book of the girl trilogy anywhere locally.  It was on Amazon and in hardback and in good condition.<br />I just finished the 500+ pages of the ...Hornet's Nest and am thrilled I could get it so quickly without hassle.  The series itself is a phenomenon so don't miss any of the series.  Buy on Amazon to save money and get the same new quality that you can then resell.  I recommend this seller who was prompt and honest.
B0036TGSRG|5|\\"The Ghost Writer\\" is a Roman Polanski political thriller of the first order. It is very cleverly plotted with gripping suspense and narrative drive that pulls you into the story. Some movies of late have seemed endless; in this one I was completely unaware of time passing and was completely enthralled by this story of the deepest intrigue. It's full of conspiracies, and the whole thing is done in a very classy, sophisticated manner that will remind you of Hitchcock at his very best. It's engrossing and involving.<br />The acting is top-notch with Ewan McGregor very effective as the ghost writer who has been brought in to liven up the memoirs of a former prime minister (played extremely well by Pierce Brosnan). He is a Tony Blair figure who has been fingered for war crimes by one of his former cabinet ministers. He has ordered the arrest and rendering out of Britain of suspects so that they could be tortured for information.<br /> The movie begins in gloomy, leaden weather on the ferry to Martha's Vineyard. A car is discovered without a driver. The man's body turns up later on the island, the victim of accident, suicide, or as we rightly assume, murder. Foul play indeed! He is the previous ghost writer who has now been replaced by McGregor. And of course he found out too much while doing his research. McGregor, of course, knows he could be a target as well.<br /> Polanski has deliberately made very mundane matters seem full of import and menace. It's full of clues and mysterious doings in the austere modernistic house so alien to the Vineyard. The cinematography and atmospherics are terrific. A lot of sinister-seeming goings-on.<br /> They don't make them this good anymore, and I think viewers will be pleasantly surprised. The intellectually curious and politically savvy will be impressed, I think. Pierce Brosnan by the force of his personality makes Tony Blair seem like a naïve schoolboy by comparison.

0316067598|5|Meaning most libs will want to stay away since the book offers a perspective not typically characteristic of the left mindset-love/pride of Country, self-reliance, ruthlessness, realization of true evil/repudiation of moral relativism, vociferous expression of male aggression (feminists definitely stay away), and of course the destruction of-as opposed to having crackers and tea with-our enemies. There is a reason you don't see many-or most likely any-libs in SF-you have to be a Patriot to the bone to go through that training; and most that I have seen are proud of America for the \\"first time\\" because a black man is running for Pres. How would I ever imagine them putting their lives on the line for it?<br /><br />That said, Mr. Luttrell is a harder than iron and steel Hero of the highest order. I simply cannot express by mere words my admiration for him and EVERY SINGLE Special Forces operative who has ever served this country. His will to survive is utterly incomprehensible to me, an Army Vet with just a modicum of hardcore training.<br /><br />The book is an unfortunate indictment of American ROE as well as the poor judgment of military and civilian leaders who underestimated the threat and prematurely split the war into 2 fronts. The 3 dead heroes in the book should have been alive today-I wish they were-if not for the incompetence in conducting both wars. Leaving blame-names out of it, the Team should not have been in the position to have to decide whether to kill the goatherders or let them go.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Luttrell for sharing your experiences with us armchair quarterbacks, for only you and those who have been on the front lines are truly the ones who have the right to tell how it is and how it should be, and all we should do is nod. (Unless you're a clap-trap leftist of course, in which case I hope I've REALLY pissed you off)<br /><br />That said, this book is a powerful inspirational journal of an unbelievable story-if it weren't so true-soon tolight up the big-screen near you.

So by then the music box is almost gone, and before I'm even half way done re winding it, another robot attacks and BOOM Jack-in-the-box is after me. If you could fix the time it takes for robots to go away after you put the mask on, then this will be a five star game.

B005UG542S|4|A great movie, great story.... You know... You've either seen it or heard that you have to see it! Buy it!
B006PZBR8S|4|Honestly, this movie isn't at all what I expected, in a good way.<br />It was entertaining and had a great &#34;underdog&#34; appeal to it.  Great movie for kids, and the effects are just great with the robots.<br />It's not &#34;top 10&#34; type of movie, it's just solid and entertaining.
B00EMXBDMA|5|One of the most tense and riveting works I've read ever. A true story of survival based on real science. While it can get a bit boring as the book struggles to hold readers interest with Marks logs alone, it finds a much brisker pace as the book continues to end up at its remarkable conclusion. Highly highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5|I absolutely loved reading the book and am looking forward to reading the next in the series.  A well written suspense!
B00CS74W0C|3|I was very disappointed that this was a trilogy with no ending and when and how it ended literally made no sense......I am going to have to buy the last book just so I can find out how this story ends...........
B00G70K1HY|2|I ordered the Wolverine thinking this would be a fun action movie.  I was not a fan.  The story seemed to drag on for me.  I the movie needed better pacing.  The premise seemed to have a lot going for it.  The acting was good but the movie was too slow.
B00BEZTMFY|5|My wife is a collector.  We just watched part 2 and was disappointed it was not the conclusion.  But, we are also glad that part 3 will be even better.  Ian McKellen is a great actor.
B006RUJST6|4|Colleen Hoover did a great job with the intensity of their relationship. My heart was pounding away in my chest through the entire book. I cried and cried for this couple and their situation(s). This book turned me into a complete sap! I can't even describe just how beautiful their love was. It was passionate and tragic and beautiful... I really don't know what else to say about it other than WOW, JUST WOW.<br /><br />The secondary characters were just as amazing. Lake's mom & brother. Will's brother. Eddie and Gavin. They all had such amazing personality and I loved each and every one of them.
B008602KQI|4|I usually do like the book better than the movie but in this case, I liked them both. The movie you can understand why it needed to be cut shorter and left a few things out that may have helped the plot but all in all it was great. The make up was good, the acting was great, I really enjoyed it. I do Hope they have a sequel to follow the rest of the series.
B004EPYZUS|5|loved this one . so very glad there working on another as we speak. tom cruise sure knew what he was doing taking over on the mission impossible products.

6304078145|5|I personally liked this conglomerated offerings of several different directors (the most noteworthy of which being none other than Quentin Tarentino, the man, the myth, the legend). I'm too darn lazy to look up the other contributors so screw it, on with the review. This movie is all about  Ted, the bellboy (played by Tim Roth, of at least two other Tarantino  films), who is stuck at a sprawling Hollywood hotel on New Year's Eve. Ted  is faced with four equally nerve-wracking sets of guests, which nearly  drive him over the edge. At least he gets something in return for his hard  work in the end (in the Tarantino directed segment). The soundtrack is done  entirely by the incredibly talented but underrated band Combustible Edison  (insert fanfare here), who are one of my favorite bands, of not my current  favorite. All in all I'd say this movie is at least worth a rental and  probably a purchase too (if you can find it, stores generally tend to  listen to big, biased evil critic demons from Uranus). Huzzaw!
B004ZMWUCU|3|I rated this a three. Because it seemed a little slow at getting to the story.  It did have a nice twist at the end.
0802473156|5|Often, when I buy a self help book, I end up starting and never really finishing it or getting in to it.  This book, however, has been quite different.  It flows and is a very easy read without a lot of difficult jargon and has really opened my eyes.  Yes, once you read this book it will seem like pure common sense, but it has diffused my anger at others (such as in-laws) and other people close to me.  For example, it drives me nuts that certain individuals are CONSTANTLY showering my children with gifts but now I understand WHY.  For me, it doesn't not speak love while for others, it is their way of showing their love.  It is also helped me to understand myself in ways I SHOULD have already known; I understand, now, why I have felt so lonely at times in my marriage.  If you are having a disconnect with a loved one, someone who you know loves you but you always wonder why they don't \\"show\\" it...this is the book for you.  In addition, I thought that I would skip the repeat books, such as the one for understanding your children, because I thought they would probably be redundant.  However, I now think I will be buying that particular book as I can already see how one of my children is more of a physical touch type person and would love to explore these ideas further for showing my children love in their own languages.
B00002Z88D|5|This album is really great.  You can really hear the mix between rock and classical music. This is a superb addition to their already great collection ! Metallica Rules !  Next year at the PROMS in Antwerp !
B007RP4D5Y|5|I've really been enjoying this album since I received it as a gift this Christmas. The playing is very genuine, and there is a feeling of freshness throughout. Relaxed, yet virtuosic. Really enjoyable!
B00B5HQLMI|5|An intense action drama more so than usual and right up to the very end of this very enjoyable flick.
B00HI48XOG|3|It was a little more violent for my taste, but others may find it ok. For that reason, I didn't watch it all.
B00GXKVZSW|5|Hannibal keeps you on the edge of your seat. Its unpredictable, shows intellect, and reminds you why Hannibal Lecter always was a man not to be messed with.....
B004LSJCJM|2|Turning point in acclaimed musician's career? One has a ground to put up a question after listening to Dust Bowl notwithstanding praised reviews by majority of European and American critics.<br /><br />The character of the music all throughout the album is hindered which is so unlike Mr. Bonamassa although listener can hear lengthy and technically perfect guitar solos. But technical performance is a physical thing only although very important. What is crucial here is that Blues have been vaporized and this might've happened because hopefully Mr. Bonamassa is in process of searching new style. Blues has gone; even those Blues tunes that can hardly be found on this album sound languid.<br /><br />Obvious example of Blues extinguishment is black lungs, matadors and whales Mr. Bonamassa sings about. Opponent could argue these are new attributes of new Blues Joe Bonamassa is trying to embed and I would agree if not just one \\"no\\"...We could not hear a Blues. One can change theme of the Blues song but nobody can change its musical essence.<br /><br />This work could be best described as mixed genres album with Blues elements to a lesser extent thus marking probable change in direction of Bonamassa's musical liking.<br /><br />Personnel: Joe Bonamassa - vocals; guitar; Rick Melick - keyboards; Tal Bergman - drums, percussion.<br /><br />pastblues.com
0880796863|5|I have used the Rider Tarot off and on for years. This deck published by US GAMES is a Wonderful Reproduction of the Original Rider. The deck is a good price, and great for beginners! The back of the cards have a nice pattern, and the cards are Sturdy but Easy to work with. Included is the book THE KEY TO THE TAROT, which is historical, and a nice read, it includes a poster to lay out the Celtic Cross. I recomend this Deck Highly.<br />-dop
B000002H33|5|Perfection, You can not ask for anything better and this one is equally great to RTL and AJFA. You cannot just own MOP when you can own all three equally perfect releases in Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and And Justice For All.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Haven't read a book I liked so well, in a while.  Characters were so well betrayed, I really felt I knew them. Wanted to thank John Grissham for writing such a entertaining novel.
B00BSBU4EC|4|Seriously. This movie was great. It was adorable, yet enjoyable. I'm 17 and I thought this movie was well done.
B004EPZ07K|2|I hate this type of movie, and don't get me wrong I'm a big DC fan. I just hate this type of movie. You got great actors, great special effects, a decent villain, and a hero that I would love to see again in another movie. What's wrong is that it's boring. This is the type of movie that I hate. Green Lantern is not a terrible movie, it's given so much that it has the potential to be a great movie. But on the other hand there is nothing for me to hate about this movie other than that it's boring. I'm stuck in the middle, can't decide whether I like this movie or hate it. I will say that I did not see a bad movie.<br /><br />Green Lantern is about a hero who police the galaxy of scum, and where was the setting? On freaking Earth! Green Lantern is a space opera like comic book hero, you set it in space where we see Hal Gordon beat the living pulp out of alien scum, not on Earth. Nothing big happens on Earth. If you love this movie and disagree with me, more power to you. I don't blame you, I see why you like this movie. It's just not for me.
B00007KWHG|5|Oh Man! If you're a fan of the 4 Seasons you must have this wonderful collection of their music! Wow
B00QW8TYWO|5|All I can say is that it's awesome.
B007TK77QE|3|OK
B00CSR2J9I|4|Really fun to play and entertaining. Id play this game on roadtrips anytime. Fun to play with friends and see who can do better.
0062107321|2|I have read and enjoyed several other books by Amy Tan; this one not so much. It is fairly well written but is slow moving and predictable, particularly in the chain of depressing elements of the story line. Basically if anything good happens it is incredibly short lived and basically a set up for the next terrible event to happen. I get that the life of a courtesan was not happy one and that pain and trying circumstances are going to be part of a life story saga but overall this book reads like a feminine version of one of TC Boyle's darker works.
B000V63CI0|5|This one is Bat Out Of Hell two. Look at my review for Bat Out Of Hell one. It includes both.
B00HZ3C4N6|5|Great movie
6303542352|4|\\"House of Cards\\" may be the most fun many of us can have watching \\"Masterpiece Theater\\".  It's story tells little more than the ascension of Francis Urquart (Ian Richardson) from a \\"party whip\\" in British Parliament to the ultimate position of Prime Minister.  Schooled in the mechanics of parliaments' nastier side, Urquart outclasses those who stand between him and his prize. Aided by his wife, but finding much help in his rivals' wooden-headed resolve to play fair, FU is all but assured of triumph.  While political evils are normally excused based on their good intentions, Urquart's are so irredeemably blackened that you'll never doubt how evil a guy he is - associating himself with greed, the police state and, when that's not enough, Americans (the epitome being a loud and corpulent sod who, while Urquart has yet to become PM, discusses his plans for FU's government; to drive home what those plans entails, the villainous yank presses FU while halfway through a steak large enough to have come from 2 cows).  While FU counsel's caution, the only obstacle, ironically, is his love for a young journalist who has enough material to expose and bring his march on Parliament (like FU himself) to its knees.  Will the evil FU (who communicates to us the depth of his dark ways with an on-running soliloquy ala Richard III) succumb to love, or will he stay true to form?<br />Though Urquart wears his evil openly, he and this multi-parter are actually full of surprises.  For his wicked ways, FU is probably the most compelling hero you'll likely see on \\"Masterpiece Theater\\", and, if you're not up on that show, \\"House of Cards\\" is probably your best excuse for watching it at least once.  Suggesting Shakespearean scheming and character-destruction (besides the \\"Richard III\\" monolog, there is Urquart's Lady Macbeth of a wife, while the young reporter with whom he courts love and his own destruction hints at a coupling of King Lear with Ophelia), the centerpiece is Ian Richardson as the smiling usurper-in-waiting who breathlessly outmaneuvers his clueless enemies.  (FU implicates the PM in a stock deal over new drugs his government certifies).  Never hesitating to tell us how much fun he's about to have, FU suggests that his audience is a whole lot smarter than the Brits over whom he's to govern, even though he ends up fooling us both. Only Mattie Storin, the reporter seems to have an insight into the real Urquart, and maybe that's why we're so eager for the mean FU to take action and win out over FU the good guy.  \\"House of Cards\\" is \\"Masterpiece Theater\\" that gets you to root, even if for the bad guys.
B00BF123WG|1|Never ogt to see the movie.  ZIt kep dopwnlaoding and stopping and froze up after awhile.  Went to Netflix and had no problem<br /><br />So I never got to watch the movie and feel I was shorted out of the rental fee.
B002OMZTSU|5|This is a great book that I couldn't put down.  Sad and funny but uplifting too. Well written also. Bravo, Craig ,a. SCOTSMAN with an American soul.
B00015YVD6|5|I won't write a story about this movie, I'll make it short for you. This movie is a classic, must have collection. It's a good movie about a mermaid who falls in love with a boy, who she then meet again when there all grown up as a coincidence. She falls in love with him over again, as if this was her destiny she looks for him and both of there worlds are turned up side down, with laughs and tears you can't hold back, this movie is pure enjoyment. This movie is really good, so you watch it now and conclude the rest.
B008TVLRU4|3|There's a lot of information here. It's in an unstructured format and so is hard to digest. Particularly as I switched from audio to reading.<br /><br />I would highly recommend reading this. Then going over other analysis of Marcus Aurelius to make it stick.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Love the entire series, however, so disappointed that you have to pay for season 5, what's up with that?
B00DPM90C4|5|Great read. Looking forward to more from Terry Hayes.
B00005O3VC|5|Monty Python is one of those things people think is incredibly funny - or incredibly stupid. I fall into the incredibly funny camp. This film still makes me laugh so hard I almost pee my pants. I think you can tell a lot about a person by asking them what is their favorite line from the movie. Mine: \\"Watery tarts handing out swords is no basis for a system of government.\\"<br /><br />I only wish that they had restored the film for this supposedly deluxe special edition. The picture is still as washed out and grainy as I remember it from the late-late show.

B0002EXH4A|5|`Rust In Peace' is usually hailed as Megadeth's crowning glory, but there are still a fair number of Thrash fans who prefer the album's heavier predecessor `So Far, So Good...So What!'. <br /> <br />`So Far, So Good...So What!' saw Megadeth as a band at it's most dangerous. Dave Mustaine was hitting the heroin and the booze like they were going out of business. Half the band had been sacked, and the producer replaced. Capitol Records were becoming concerned about the behaviour of the band, and sent them on tour so they couldn't do any more damage in the studio. They need not have worried, as `So Far, So Good...So What!' rapidly went platinum on its release. <br /> <br />Despite the obvious success of the album, Dave Mustaine had always been dissatisfied with the way `So Far, So Good...So What!' turned out, so he went into the studio in 2004 and remixed it, along with much of the rest of Megadeth's back catalogue. He disliked the sometimes muddy mix, which detracted somewhat from the power of the album. There were also a few small details either hidden or missing from the album. The remixing is like an archaeologist scraping dirt and dust from a prehistoric skeleton. It was always obvious what was there, but once the detritus is cleared, sharp, clean edges are revealed, details unveiled, and it all seems more complete. <br /> <br />The instrumental first track \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" is one of the best lead off tracks on any Thrash album anywhere, bettered by Slayer's \\"Angel Of Death\\", but not by much else. Thrash instrumentals are generally about lead guitarists showing off, and in Mustaine and Jeff Young, Megadeth had talent aplenty to display. The lead guitar throughout the song is sharp, bouncing from one man to the other in what sounds like a frantic guitar duel. There is an undefinable quality to the song, giving it a feel like a reinterpreted Classical composition. The remix added a triumphal brass fanfare to the beginning of the song that was absent on the 1988 release. To be honest, the horns don't add a hell of a lot to the guitar-fuelled maelstrom, but they made MegaDave happy. <br /> <br />\\"Set The World Afire\\" was the first song Mustaine wrote on his departure from Metallica, but he did not use it until he was happy with it. The first riff sounds like it would have fitted onto `Kill `Em All' quite neatly, but the rest of the song shows Mustaine's songwriting metamorphosing and developing. The lyrics are suitably cheesy, a song about nuclear war, which it was just about compulsory for every 1980s Thrash band to have at least one of (Metallica's \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\", Kreator's \\"Fatal Energy\\", Carnivore's \\"World Wars III and IV\\", Sodom's \\"Nuclear Winter\\", Nuclear Assault's `Game Over' album etc.). <br /> <br />The cover of the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy In The UK\\" actually features Steve Jones from the Pistols on guitar, but apparently he played so poorly that his guitar work was deliberately buried deep in the mix. Legend has it he turned up drunk, plugged his guitar in and just started playing, without tuning his guitar. Inexplicably, Mustaine messed with the lyrics, swapping the line \\"I want to destroy the passer by\\" with \\"I want to destroy, possibly\\", along with a couple of other minor alterations. <br /> <br />\\"In My Darkest Hour\\" is far and away the best song on the album, and the remixing adds another layer of vindictive menace to it. Mustaine wrote the lyrics of the song in a single sitting on hearing the news that friend and former Metallica band mate Cliff Burton had been killed. It is his best lyrical effort, bar none. The song uses a building narrative structure with no verses or chorus to detract from the momentum. The rhythm guitar follows a series of relatively simple riffs that swell to an almighty crescendo. The leads hold a certain angle grinder type quality, which only appear on this album. <br /> <br />\\"Liar\\" and \\"Hook In Mouth\\" follow a similar venomous lyrical streak, which unfortunately Mustaine abandoned after this album in favour of conspiracies, aliens and witches. Oh well... The solos on \\"Hook In Mouth\\" in particular are impressive as Mustaine and Jeff Young trade licks perfect for air guitar aficionados to imitate. Surprisingly, Young's solos are the heavier of the two. <br /> <br />The weaker tracks \\"Mary Jane\\" and \\"502\\" and the inclusion of the Sex Pistols cover pad the album out somewhat. None of them are particularly poor songs, but they seem to have been written and recorded like the band was on autopilot. Still, Megadeth circa 1988 on autopilot was still a hell of a lot better than a lot of stuff being palmed off on Metal fans at the time. <br /> <br />As a bonus, four of the tracks originally mixed by producer Paul Lani have been included on the album. Lani struggled in producing the record, and was eventually replaced by Michael Wagener, who was responsible for the final 1988 production job. Even to the untrained ear, a number of problems are immediately obvious. All four songs sound very thin, even compared to the 1988 release. \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" still has the horns of the introduction left in the mix, but throughout the song, the guitar lines drift in and out, like they were recorded outside on a windy day. Even a song as powerful as \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" sounds flat and a bit gutless. <br /> <br />The original mix of `So Far, So Good...So What!' suffered somewhat because of limitations on time, budget, technology, and probably substance impaired musical abilities, but it was the best that could be done at the time. Metal production in 1988 was far from the refined science it is now, and the leap in the power and scope of technology between 1988 and 2004 is enormous. `So Far, So Good...So What!' was hailed as a flawed masterpiece on it's original release, and has rightly remained a much admired work from a highly influential band.
B007J4T2G8|3|I had no idea what this book was about.<br />It sure makes your imagination wander.😊 I had no idea that sort of thing actually happens.
B00HA8WNZ0|5|This is a fun progressive game I very much like the fact I can pick it up and put it down without missing a beat. It is very cerebral and keeps your mind active.<br /><br />It does start with easy levels that progress with difficulty. I breeze through some and others not. I just spent the last 24 hours off and on trying to complete level N puzzle 24. I thought it was a bug in the game and then finally cracked it.<br /><br />While some games are intense and consume vast amounts of time, this can entertain for the moment or for an hour. I highly recommend.

B000BW7QWW|5|I recently finished watching the series on DVD and enjoyed it, but I was blown away by this movie.  I enjoyed it so much that I immediately watched it again with commentary by Joss Whedon.      For me the standouts in a fine cast were Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau.  Glau's fight sequences were astounding and surprising considering that her character spent most of the series in a catatonic state.  There are also some surprises that will shock fans of the series.    Finally I was very impressed with the cinematography and lighting.  I highly recommend the Whedon commentary to gain an even greater appreciation of some of the intricacies of this very fine film.
B0052UZIFA|3|I had this on my previous phone and it was a great game, that I couldn't put down when I started playing. I haven't managed to get through two levels on the Galaxy Nexus before the game locks up though.
156898443X|4|Gregory's crude drawings are reminiscent of Ralph Steadman and Bill Gallo. I particularly liked the whimsical self-portraits, including Happy Hedgehog Gregory. In short, Gregory's journal is intimate without being self-indulgent. It's also cathartic for anyone who has been damaged by tragedy. We're all a work in progress and I applaud Gregory's honest outpouring of emotion.

B00DJYKFXG|2|I purchased this for the DVD of the New Years Eve show. I was in the first row and thought there was a good possibility I would see myself at 16 years old. If not I would have the show on DVD. When I opened the box and put on the DVD it was not the footage I was lead to believe I was buying but the original CD with still photo's of the band. I purchased the record when it came out in 1972  and the CD years later. A few years back I purchased the CD again when the Dylan songs were added.  It was a great show in fact all four shows are great but if you think you are getting the Band DVD and going to see them actually doing the songs you are mistaken. It is a shame and I think this was wrongfully advertised by the record company and Robbie.
B00H71PHS0|5|I didn't think I would care for it when it first came on TV but I got hooked.  It is great.
B0038M2AZA|5|This movie is one of my favs.  It gave me an honest and eye-opening view of autism from someone who actually knows what they are talking about.  Highly recommended. I would also recommend Temple's books, The Autistic Brain, which gives a more clinical view of the autistic brain, and The Way I See It.  Temple is such an inspiring woman.

B00LZ7GSX0|5|&#34;Undertow&#34; took me completely by surprise in how much I enjoyed reading it right from the opening paragraph to the very last line. A Dystopian storyline about ALPHA soldiers that live in the deep waters who emerge to live on land. Lyric Walker, sixteen year old high schooler, is fascinated by the Alpha's and feels drawn to one in particular. Lyric is asked by the government official handling the transition of the Alpha's into the school system to befriend Fatham, the crown prince. Lyric is instructed to help teach him english and hopefully provide an opening for the rest of the students to become more tolerant and accepting towards the Alpha's.<br /><br />This is such a fascinating read and I particularly enjoyed the way the author presented the conflict amongst the students and the tension that can arise between races.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing more by this author.

B008IJTFYW|4|Kindle Fire HD - 8.9&#34;<br /><br />Sometimes in the middle of the day a person just needs to take a nap and drown out everything around them. Turn on this app, select your mood (tunes), and relax away. A nice selection of sounds to choose from that loop constantly. You can turn one or ten... your choice. Plus you can actually adjust the volume of each sound in case the bells are too loud or the thunder is too quiet.<br /><br />Aside from wishing there were a few more tunes (types of music) to choose from, the one annoyance is that this app uses only portrait mode. That means when the Kindle is propped up in its case, which is landscape, the app doesn't turn. Not a big deal except when you are trying adjust it on your nightstand as you doze off for a while. Overall a good app to have, even with the ads.<br /><br />Warning: Sounds may appear more realistic than you realize. Fell asleep once with the claiming rain and thunder one time only to wake up a short time later thinking it was pouring rain outside and that I left my car windows down. Took a minute to figure out where the thunder was coming from as I looked out at a clear blue sky when I jumped too my feet to look out the window.

B000GFLAI0|5|Bob Dylan has been called a cultural icon, a voice of a generation and by his own admission, a song and dance man. After reading his brilliant memoir, Chronicles, we find he has little use for labels of any kind. With the new Modern Times, Dylan continues on by making music that can not be pigeonholed under a specific label. It's certainly not a pop or rock and roll CD, that's obvious. What the bard has done here is fuse blues based sensibilities with a hint of jazz and some down home country musings. Dylan fans are use to brilliant lyrics, so when he compares \\"sleep to a temporary death\\" we tend not to gasp with excitement; rather we shake our heads in disbelief that at 65 he still has some sting. What's fascinating after all of his work is his ability to write such melodic music. After just one listen, these melodies are still with me! Modern Times is the perfect antidote for the modern times in which we live. This will be filed under D for Dylan at your local retailer, but it belongs under B for BRILLIANT! I guess there is a label for him after all!
B0050CQY1W|4|Breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Though I loathe the hard and over singing sometimes (you have a great voice, no need to over do it, let it flow!), this is a nice album.  Definitely for the older set.  I'm not one that feels age should dictate the kind of music you should make, but it's nice to hear a mature sound from her.  Kinda puts you in the mind of \\"Dangerously In Love\\" with it's more R&B oriented influence.  The flow of the album is also nice--her previous albums, for me, didn't really seem as cohesive.  It starts off slow/mid-tempo, then picks up momentum towards the end.  Nothing really bad to say except that \\"Run The World\\" completely throws the album off.  I'm interested in how she will tour with this new project, and future videos.  Also curious as to how the fans that have liked her other stuff will feel about this.<br /><br />Good music.
0517118297|1|This review is regarding the quality of the 1994 hardcover edition published by Grammercy. I ordered this edition several weeks ago and was extremely disappointed to find it was poor quality. The binding is acceptable when new but after a week of light use, I already noticed deterioration on the front binding. Actually the binding is so poor that, if not careful, you could easily tear some of the front pages out. The paper quality is cheap and is the same used for mass media paperbacks expect slightly thinner. Overall, I was so dissatisfied with this edition that I returned it.<br />However, I would also like to make a recommendation. After returning the book, I was still looking for collection of Austen's works and happened to find a 1995 hardcover edition of this exact book by Grammercy. The edition costs five dollars more but the quality is ten times better. The book has a faux leather cover with gold trimmed pages and a ribbon bookmark. The paper quality in thin but polished, smoother and more refined. The binding is very durable and I have noticed no deterioration yet after a week of use.<br />If I had to a chance to redo my purchases, I would have skipped this edition completely and ordered the 1995 edition. If your interested in this edition, it can be found using search under ISBN # 0517147688
B000001F7R|5|This was hard rock/metal the way it should be.  If you have read my other reviews you will know by now that I was a teenager when these albums were coming out.  Unlike many of you who probably weren't born when this was released, I remember the period when these albums came out (well I sort of remember, some of it was a blurr)..<br /><br />First, what was metal?  It was raw agression.  There was no need to fine tune.  You went into the studio drunk, you plugged in, you played, you recorded and you left.. THAT was it.. But what you got was incredible metal.<br /><br />Just listen to this stuff.  Rock Brigade, Hello America, It could be you, wasted, rocks off.. This stuff was awesome.. I won't go into detail on every song because earler reviewers do an adequate job, but this album absolutely rocks.<br /><br />Is this album as 'refined' as later Lepard albums.. No.. But what would you rather jam to, an unrefined Wasted or a polished 'Pour Some Sugar On Me'?..what a freaking joke)<br /><br />Def leppard released two great albums, this one and High and Dry, then Mutt Lange AKA Mr Shania Twain (after producing High and Dry) started tinkering with them, leading to Pyromania, which was the beginning of the end.  Joe Elliot decided that it was more fun singing silly love songs to teen age girls, and the party ended for the head bangers. Yeah it was great to go to Def Leppard concerts, not for the music but for the women, but after awhile it was almost an embarrassment to say that you were seeing them live...<br /><br />So do yourself a favor, Buy this, buy High and Dry, and then if you want to waste some money on watered down Def Leppard buy their greatest hits. At least with the greatest hits you get the best of their worst.
B000UBMWG4|5|The Blu Ray 5 disk set is without a doubt the most in depth treatment of a film that I have ever viewed.  I think I can safetly say that I now know everything there is to know about Blade Runner. No stone has been left unturned.    I have always found this movie interesting, but this collection has skyrocketed it to being one of my favorites.  The story behind the movie is just as, if not, more interesting than the movie itself.  The new documentaty \\"Dangerous Days\\" is one of the most fascinating I have seen in a while, and is alone reason to buy this new set.    If you have any interest at all in this film, this set is a must own.  This is one of the most beautiful sci-fi flicks ever made, and the 5 versions presented here are all viewed in wonderful high def.  I have never been to film school but I definatley think I deserve a diploma, now that I have graduted the school of Blade Runner.
B00910Y1OQ|5|I got this game and now I can't leave it alone! It's challenging the more times you complete it but it does glitch frustratingly often. The music is pleasant and the graphics are ok. Pretty good time killer.
B002GZQYMA|5|Muse have not only met the high expectations that came with this album but have surpassed it which may not amount to much with any other band but Muse.<br /><br />Absolutely amazing.
B00CL50LEC|5|I love this movie. It is great. Anyone you that loves both action and love story's needs to read it.
B000089RVX|1|if ya only knew how much i hate this album, you would be knocked down with all the hate. how dare amy lee and her pack of hoodlums run around making this garbage music. if this was released in the good old days of hard rock, it wouldn't sell a stinking copy. how dare they name the band something so silly and fluffy. how dare they win the best new band grammy. the best new band should not be them. more like the most overrated, disgusting, silly, worst band of the year.
B00E3VTR1K|5|This was a refreshing read.  I have become a huge fan of LR. This book embodied what I love most: short stories, science fiction and adventure. If you love science fiction and technology with a mix of the unknown, this would be a great read.
B00K2CHWYI|5|I really like this movie. It is to bad it was so poorly marketed with it was released in theaters. I am glad I could convince my wife to go see it, as she had almost no interest in it at the time. However, she left the theater quite impressed and was glad we saw it. So if your wife is the type who usually binge watches movies like &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; but can give this movie a good review, I think that says a lot about how well done it is. And if my wife reads this review, I love you. :)
B002GYI9C4|4|I read these books on the request of my wife, who loved the Mistborn series, and now places it as one of her all-time favorite book series. I had been invested in another series and needed a break from it, to try something different, so I picked up Mistborn. I'm writing this after having read all three books.    This is the first of a trilogy that follows Vin, a poor street girl from the slums who has barely survived. She comes to learn she has extraordinary powers, and learns from Kelsier, another of the books main characters how to use her power. The book defines a Bad Guy, the emperor: Lord Ruler and his minions, the Good guys: Kelsier's Crew, and the Unknown: The Mist. These elements all set the Base for the entire series.    The series has a wonderful and refreshing approach to \\"magic\\" in that its not some inane ability, but is a genetic ability that is only activated during a traumatic event. The ability itself is using metals that give people specific abilities. This plays into the plot as does almost every other detail revealed in the series. Every race of people, place, religion, and history all come into play, and makes the series very detailed. The downside to this detail is everything gets defined at some point, and causes the series as a whole to feel less epic, and the world a little small.    I didn't find any major plot twists or significant moments that made me feel \\"that's just wrong\\", as other books do with the fine line morality and survival. This overall is a PG/PG-13 style book that is a fun, easy to follow read that is very enjoyable, but not quit epic.
0670033375|4|It's worth the time even if you've read his prior works. Yes, there's some duplication, but only a little. <br /> <br />Very interesting.
B003L77GG0|5|Like new and operating smoothly. Thanks for a fine product.
0399146253|4|Having gone through the devistation that happens when losing someone you love, I am relieved that Patricia Cromwell didn't gloss over Kay's loss, as she has in the past.  All the characters in Kay Scarpetta's life touch her and deserve to be mourned when they pass over.  Through her grief, Kay, not only becomes more human, but now has the chance to move forward in her emotional life.<br />I found the parts about the Loup-Garou to be a bit dissatisfying.  It would be interesting to know about his life story more as a human being than as the monster we think of him to be.  However, that would probably be another book.  <br />The twists and turns were not as clearly defined and easy to follow on a first reading and could have been paced a little slower.<br />All in all, I found this to be an excellent book that allowed the reader to feel everything that Kay is feeling.
B00003CWL6|5|The image that got a lot of people interested in this film was that of Mena Suvari lying back in a bed of roses. What endeared it to sensitive souls was its' masterly use of score and mood. Sour-faced critics and others loved its' likeness to 60s satire- its pithy put-downs & side-swipes at the suburban 'American' dream. All these things are known about American Beauty- 'The Graduate' is its' closest forefather. But I would like to look closer. Spacey and Benings' performances have been praised enough- but this is an ensemble film. Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley are all excellent. What? the critics might say. Sure, they're ok at highlighting the vacuous of American youth but they're not that interesting- that's what they're thinking. This utterly fails to understand what American Beauty is about. By that criteria, the adults are just as vacuous- concerned with a sofa, their body, the car, the house, the image. It is more complicated than that. Chris Cooper's character's repression manifests itself in heavy-handed discipline. We see his  wife, kind but blank,  as blank as Lester Burnham  is beginning to feel, just as Bening cries in quiet desperation. Ricky Fitz tries to find meaning in art and nature and, in him, Janie has found somebody who mirrors her own dark nature but who, to her, seems to have an overwhelming confidence in his own abilities- confidence she lacks for she is a suburban rebel, discontented at herself and her parents more than the world at large- she is part of the Nirvana generation. Like the others, she craves personal happiness. What we see in the film is how adults can become radical while their children are conservative and vice versa- tension rides throughout the film  punctuated by violence, sex and dark humour. But those who purely see it as a damning indictment on sleepy suburban mall-going America are forgetting that, throughout, it shows you that there is beauty, emotion, and dreaming in the apparently mundane , like an EdwardHopper or Rene Magritte painting. It's intelligent, light, dark, sexy and funny.
B00BEZZBFO|5|This is the second product I buy from NOCTUA. The first was a CPU Cooler, I'm so satisfied with this product that decided to try this fan for back air output. The fan is super silent and I noticed a couple degrees cooler than the stock cooler that comes with the case.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Really funny, actual people besides animals, good graphics.
B009YQJ322|4|I like it because it does not it does not overplay the action. not really much more to say. good-by

B00821OX98|5|Makes you want to never stop watching.  Great show!
030746363X|5|After reading the good reviews and the bad reviews, I had hesitated on getting this book.  What ultimately drove me to purchase the book was how much I got from Tim's previous book, The Four Hour Work Week.  His writing style carries over to this book and within a few pages I found myself smiling at the unique, unfiltered writing style of Tim Ferriss.  I have to admit, there were a few chapters I breezed through as they were not for me and my current goals.  But, what's important to note is that one of the very first things Tim will tell you in this book is to skip around! Be skeptical!  To me, this book was about \\"Hey, this is how I did it and what worked for me, now you go try and feel free to tweak\\".  People who take this book as a literal how-to are missing the point.  The point is to open yourself up to self-experimentation and find what works for you.  Keep tweaking until you get the most results with the least amount of effort.  With that said, I have to focus in on the first few chapters.  While I'm not following the slow-carb diet to the T, I'm down from 225 to 215 and I had 3 trips to great restaurants Saturday in which I partook in meals such as NY Strip Steak, Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi and Chocolate Rasberry Truffle Chessecake to name a few. (Thank you cheat day!)  I hardly work out and just by using Tim's map of what I can and can't eat I've changed my eating habits drastically with minimum motivation.  If you're curious about this book and wondering if it could help you with your specific goals, just look at the table of contents.  If there's anything you want to do, from losing weight to jumping higher, it's worth checking out.
B00AZMFK3K|5|I enjoyed the movie. What great is you get three for the price of one.
1401938906|5|If you think, like I did, that this is another book just like all the others you have read about inspiration, spirituality, and self-improvement, you could not be more wrong.<br /><br />Heck, even if it were  like the rest, that in itself would still be awesome support and reinforcement.  But. It's. Better.<br /><br />This is support for moving from theory into action.  From knowing to experiencing.  I can learn all I want about the field of potentiality (FP), but until I live it I haven't yet understood it.  This book gives nine simple experiments that anyone can do, using scientific processes so that we can prove to ourselves that we each have an active role in our relationship to this energy.<br /><br />Pam's writing style is very down-to-earth, relaxing, and funny.  It's a great read, a series of truly scientific experiments disguised as a conversation with someone you discover you want to spend more time with.  E-Squared allows an individual to successfully prove the following, and I am not kidding:<br /><br />1. There is an invisible energy force or field of infinite possibilities.<br /> 2. You impact the field and draw from it according to your beliefs and expectations.<br /> 3. You, too, are a field of energy.<br /> 4. Whatever you focus on expands.<br /> 5. Your connection to the field provides accurate and unlimited guidance.<br /> 6. Your thoughts and consciousness impact matter.<br /> 7. Your thoughts and consciousness provide the scaffolding for your physical body.<br /> 8. You are connected to everything and everyone else in the universe.<br /> 9. The universe is limitless, abundant, and strangely accommodating.<br /><br />These are ideas that you may have read about and even experienced; this book will prove it for those that need it, and for those who may just need a reminder.<br /><br />I received this book from Hay House in trade for my unbiased opinion of it.  Way to go, everyone--good group effort!
1616550414|4|The books wrapping was broken and I had two scratches on the book. I was really upset getting it like that but it isn't that bad. It still is a good book.
B00FAX6XQC|3|Game is entertaining and time-killing but often crashes for no reason. That  quite annoying. If they were  to fix this glitch then the game would be beyond awesome!
B004GJDQT8|5|Ooops... Somehow, I wrote a review for Amazon.com, & I think I may have posted to the wrong inquiry....?  AMAZON.COM IS BY FAR...THE VERY BEST SHOPPING WEBSITE I'VE EVER SHOPPED ON. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
B00C7KXUOE|3|Alright
B00B2DSK06|5|great movie absolutely loved it!
B008Y7N7JW|5|I was impressed at how well they captured the storyline even though the book is mostly narration. Hard to do in most cases. Even when some of the characters are missing, the main story is complete. Looking forward to the sequel.
B0083P1QUM|3|I've been reading Kay Scarpetta books for 20 years at least.  This is better than her last few but not as good as the early days.<br />That being said, still glad I read it.
B009UX2YAC|5|The  subway  surfers  are  awesome  and  very  cool, GM 7 yrs old
B00BLCHZC2|5|This show actually surprised me. I didn't think it was going to be good and I started watching it and i love it! It keeps my attention and makes me want to keep watching!
B008IJT0CE|5|Simply the best
B00AHQNHSY|4|Great Player. Supports so many formats. there is occasional instability forcing you to restart the tablet, overall a very good player
B00DUGCLY4|5|Love it but I kind of really hard but it's a good game
B00OKYQZDI|5|Thus game is just like candy crush. So I just love it. Lots of hours of FUN!! I love the colors too. Very colorful .
B000OXHRRC|5|Russell Crowe plays Max, a wealthy stock broker who inherits a wine vineyard in the South of France, from his favorite uncle. Upon his arrival, he finds the place shabby and the wine &#34;that gives you a headache&#34; and a woman from his past (Marion Cotillard). It's a charming love story and worth the watch.
B002WY65VU|5|The DVD came in Excellent condition.The movie itself was freaking funny i loved it.and it came in a short amount of time. I really got my money's worth
B000002GYR|5|This is the Greatest Album Of All Time From start to finish you can feel the pain and bittersweet joy. This is a must have.
B0063IH60K|5|I love solitaire, I can play this game forever. l just never seem to get bored with it. l highly recommend this game.
B003H9M1QM|3|This was a gift for my Grandson. I was embarassed to learn it arrived all mangled and the case broken. The discs were ok but since it's a special edition they like the cover and case to be intact. Hopefully they can figure out how to exchange without too much hassel.
B000ASATZ8|5|Great movies, especially Tremors!  The others are a lot of fun too though.  AssBlasters lol, gotta love it.  I got lucky and found the attack pack at walmart for $13.99.    I didnt realize people were looking for a collectable set or anything like that, but judging by some of the reviews, they are.  This isn't that type of set.  But if you want to have all 4 movies, this is the way to go.
B00881VLCE|4|This is such a fun app. I have always enjoyed working puzzles and now I can take it on the go with me anywhere. I would one day like to see puzzles from my childhood on here. Popples, Starwberry Shortcake, Mickey Mouse and more.
B00HYTSTNU|4|Movie was great but left some serious questions around international maritime law about arming merchant vessels. I mean you have four vagrants in what amounts to a motorized rowboat taking over a huge cargo ship.  Really....???  A couple of men with M16s would have put a quick stop to that.
0425256391|3|I don't even know what to say about this book :( I put off reading it for a very long time. I didn't want the series to end, but all things must come to an end at some point.<br /><br />I'm going to miss all of these characters so much. It seems like so many were crammed into this one as I guess a good-bye to each one. I felt like I didn't get enough of them. I felt like they were just taken from me too quickly.<br /><br />I will miss Sookie and all of the characters. I'm not even sure how to rate this book because I didn't think it was as good as the other books, but I still love the characters. All of the previous books were set up with such strong feelings, desires, love, lust, and a whole lot of crazy. There was a little crazy in this book, but it just didn't feel the same. I'm not really sure how you would end a series as full of strong characters like these.<br /><br />I wasn't very fond of Sam in this book. I know how it was explained that he didn't feel like himself, but he seemed like a big dork to me. That's not the Sam I remember.<br /><br />Part of me wanted it to be a wacked out crazy fantasy ending where Sookie has all the supernaturals as her boyfriends :) She would be Sookie the Super Slut! But, I digress.<br /><br />The ending did go out nice and sweet and I guess I'm glad for that, but I just feel bummed about the whole thing.<br /><br />MY REVIEWS:<br />www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com<br />https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1345967616
0142410322|1|I am the mother of a two children, ages seven and five. We have read and reread nearly all of Roald Dahl's children,s stories. In general, I love this author. His stories are entertaining, even magical, and so beautifully written. When reading Dahl, I am always aware that my children are exposed to high quality literature with a richness of vocabulary and ideas. Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is the only exception to our general delight with Roald Dahl. It is dark and lacks the sense of optimism, the charm, the magic of his other stories. Neither of my children enjoyed this book and I did not either. My advice would be to stop after Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and not pick up this sequel. Instead, grab Matilda, the BFG, or James and the Giant Peach and treat yourself and your kids to a real treasure!
B00001SIES|5|Like a lot of people I was first introduced to Muse through reading the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer. Since she drew so much inspiration from their music I was curious to check them out. My first stop was Wikipedia, where I learned as much as I could about the band themselves, then I hopped on over to Amazon, where I listened to sound samples from most of their albums. It's fair to say I liked what I heard.    Showbiz is surprisingly solid for a debut release. From the opening notes of Sunburn to the closing, this is definitely a worthwhile album. There are no songs onthe CD that I actually dislike, although I like some less than others. Particular favorites of mine are Sunburn, Muscle Museum (which has one of the coolest basslines ever as well as some of the coolest lyrics), Cave, Showbiz, Unintended, Uno, Sober and Overdue. I'll grant that the band's sound and Matt Bellamy's vocals bear some similarity to Radiohead, but unlike Radiohead I was instantly hooked on Muse. About the only song of Radiohead's I really like is Creep, and even that got seriously overplayed on the radio. But I liked Muse enough to buy all their albums, well except for HAARP and the as yet unreleased new album, which I do intend to own at some point. All in all a great start for a great band.
0307352153|4|An excellent book based on solid research. Well written and organized and thought provoking. I know that in the future I will certainly be paying more attention to my own quiet side, suppressed though it may be, as there much to offer.
B00G0A7KG6|5|I recommend watching this movie
B0000AZJXQ|5|Perfect Circle..truely is a perfect band..if your a maynard keenan fan this is a must have.
0780631684|1|The first movie is awful,boring plot and horrid acting unless you enjoy the Dawson's Creek cast. This movie starts out bad with a plane crashing(how original) and ends up dragging along the rest of the movie too. Also what happened to Ali Larter she looks nasty in this movie,at least she could have kept my attention to make up for a boring movie. This is an example where a sequel can be better than the first. SEE THE FINAL DESTINATION 2,INSTEAD OF THE DREADFUL FIRST ONE
B009CPJHY4|5|A wonderful story of learning how to grow; of change, of loosing and finding love, of acceptance, of changing one's attitudes and beliefs, of making new friends, of life and death, of growing old.
B004EPYZXK|3|\\"Apollo 18\\" takes the 'found foootage' horror methodology (think \\"Blair Witch\\" or \\"Paranormal Activity\\") and takes it off world. You thought Apollo 17 was our last lunar mission? You think the Russians never landed on the moon? Got news for you conspiracy minded types out there; neither of these is true. Sent up under the guise of a National Security/Department of Defense kind of Top Secret mission, our three astronauts board the Liberty and Freedom vehicles for one more investigation of what's really up there. It ain't the Sea of Tranquility, that's for sure.<br /><br />Before you know it, something is making creepy noises outside the Lunar Module. Samples are suddenly not where the explorers originally left them. And them dastardly things ripped up the USA flag! Not only are these critters scary, they're downright UnAmerican! Then again, they weren't too nice to the Ruskie that landed there before Apollo 18, and the unlucky astronauts realize that their government may not have told them everything about their journey or its intended mission. The handheld cameras soon begin jerking and spinning, the automatic cameras are going static, and the humans just might be losing their minds.<br /><br />\\"Apollo 18\\" mixes just enough \\"now-you-see-it\\" spookiness to add some real scare jolts, but mostly, it's dopey space B-Movie fun. The Metal Munching Moon Mice from the old Bullwinkle cartoons were about as believable as the space bug monsters wreaking havoc on our helpless heroes, and some of the effects are laughably bad. There's plenty of stock footage in use to help make the original bits work chronologically, however, as a horror movie is concerned, the green cheese that is \\"Apollo 18\\"? It certainly isn't rocket science.
B00CH26TL8|4|This game is fun and can be addictive!! I enjoy playing it several times a day. The only draw back is it is slow on the updates. Almost Thanksgiving and still showing Halloween.
B001UV4XIS|3|I liked seeing the final chapter in the Harry Potter saga. It was, I believe, the darkest movie of the bunch, even darker than \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\".<br /><br />I know, I know, it's supposed to be good versus evil, but how convincing would someone who is evil be if it was always dark around them? Might that be a tip off? No, in my experience, evil usually presents itself in a more comely manner.<br /><br />I thought the movie suffered from what ailed almost all of the later movies, the movies based on big books, in that you really had to have read the book in order to understand (at least part of) the movie. These movies don't stand on their own; they are like in jokes that you must know a certain something in order to get.<br /><br />These movies also suffered from taking too long to make, and the characters aged far too much for the supposed time spent. It's too bad that the films couldn't have been made much closer together, even if they were released later. The three main characters looked a lot better in the first movies than in the end.<br /><br />Speaking of the end, I thought this movie's end was a let down, a petering out rather than a finish. The movie seemed to be going through the motions, the obligatory motions at that.<br /><br />Yes, I have criticisms of this movie, but I'm pleased it finally came out. Nevertheless, it would be nice if there were more movies like the first two Harry Potter movies, with more awe and wonder. Kids grow up and many become troubled and sullen, shy, self-conflicted, and unsure, but I an not certain that makes for good movies.<br /><br />Of the three main characters, in the movies, only Hermione (Emma Watson) did a credible job throughout. Radcliffe is sometimes difficult to watch, especially in his non-HP roles I have seen. Ron (Rupert Grint) is okay, but never as good as he was when younger. And, sadly, there was too little of Maggie Smith in the last movie. Her role took an enormous hit in the editing, it seems.<br /><br />It's too bad Peter Jackson didn't make these movies.
B00DVKOYBM|4|Its fun. You get to interact with other people. Sometimes the game kicks me out while im playing but other than that i like it.
0780626966|5|Much cheaper than buying them all separately. Great for a horror fan. Comes in a nice box.
B00FOQRNPA|4|Still reading it, the information is amazing, I just can't take in too much information at once! Worth the purchase.
0307276902|5|This book took me away to another world that at times I wanted to run away from.  There is something in the way he writes that the words penetrate you, and you can feel his pain, addiction, and love.  He describes his battle for sobriety one hour at a time, and it can make you cringe, shake, cry, shout, and leave you searching for someone to hold.  There is a point where he describes these dreams he has frequently after detox, and I found myself having the same dreams after reading it.  When he fell in love with Lilly - I fell in love with Lilly.  And the others he met in rehab, well I consider them to be very good friends.  This is a fast read because it will consume your life untill the final page.  And I have never rushed out so quickly to buy the next book an authur writes.  I just hope James Frey is working on another one because I can't wait.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Challenging and fun
B000002GB9|5|This is the grand illusion, come sail away, fooling yourself and miss america. half the album classics.As on those previous albums, Dennis DeYoung's proggy keyboards lead off with the title track, a melodic and attractive piece. Styx, though, are sometimes prone to cliches and obvious philosophies. Couched in this grand production is the message that 'deep inside we're all the same.' It's rather like rolling out the red carpet to introduce a film extra. The album's theme is fame: the aspirations, disillusionment and pitfalls. DeYoung (I suspect they're his lyrics) tends to recycle his material; on separate songs we're told 'come on in,' 'step right this way' and 'climb aboard.' Tommy Shaw's two songs are quite refreshing as a result, especially the rocking 'Man In The Wilderness,' the most intense track on the album. By contrast, 'Superstars' is bland by the band's standards. DeYoung's big triumphs here, though, are the anthemic, six-minute 'Come Sail Away' and the brooding tale, 'Castle Walls.' James Young has  'Miss America.'
B00EUS9JNW|4|I bought this after seeing Sir Paul live.  His show was outstanding and he played several tracks from this album.  I found them so catchy that I had to have the album.  It's not in my top 10 but it's definitely an album I'm glad to have.  McCarney still has it.
B004X6PRO6|5|Successful at understanding the mindset of communism with great writing. Personalities really well developed, so real, ...everyone deserves sympathy. Great.
B000EHSVQ4|5|The theatrical release of Kingdom of Heaven was interesting to me because I am an amateur historian, but the film was notably flawed and felt too forced in some areas. The director's cut, while still not a perfect movie, has made up for many of those problems: It gives more substance to the characters of Balian and Sibylla, and in doing so it gives both a more vivid and somewhat more accurate portrait of what life was really like nearly 1000 years ago. The performances in this film are really stellar, with the unfortunate exception of the movie's star, Orlando Bloom. He's not a bad actor but I just get the sense he was miscast in this movie. All the rest of the actors are absolutely fantastic: Liam Neeson is once again at his grumbly, father-figure best, Marton Czokas makes a believably hatable villain, Eva Green is magnificent as the Queen of Jerusalem. Of course, the real standout here is Ed Norton as the leper king Baldwin. Unfortunately, the only flaw I found with the director's cut is that it seems that much of his dialogue was redubbed and sounds more muffled and low-quality than the original theatrical release. Having had a pretty good idea of how his performance in the original release went, it was slightly disconcerting to hear the strange drop in sound quality in this version.    But aside from that, this movie is a huge step up in cinematic quality from its original version. If you liked the original, you will love the Director's Cut.
0451228731|5|Heck YEAH! almost done with Daemon, this story is epic this will probably be the first book(s) I've read first before seeing the movie, they will probably make one I bet. (I hope it's well done!) This could be \\"The Godfather\\" of this century. Only book I've ever been obsessed with reading. I can't wait to get \\"Freedom\\" to finish the saga!  I've always been leery of getting too reliant on computers despite being an IT guy.  Now is the time to be thankful some aspects of present are still somewhat private, like some cars, and paper money! Someday this will be a thing of the past.  I actually got a little creeped out the other day when the debit card readers asked me Charge $*.** to account? YES or NO? Or calling some IVR systems ahhhh!!!!  You'll understand once you read it.  Thank you Three Wolf Moon Shirt for guiding me online to purchase this book!!![[ASIN:B002HJ377A The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee]]
B0055S348W|5|Works great
B000TDGGVU|4|Barry Schwartz does a good job presenting one of our modern day man made dilemmas that we all face; an overwhelming amount of options and choices.<br />  He does go into detail on how people deal with choices and the different approaches that people have, before opening up on the pros and cons of each of these methods. He also breaks down ways that we can actively improve our perception of and then living with the choices that we make.<br />  There are some great points to walk away with and to consider when faced with a multitude of choices.<br />Worth a look if you enjoy this type of book.
B00HWWUQWQ|4|Grandson was very happy to have his own copy of The Desolation of Smaug.
B00000JCOV|5|I must say, when I heard Surfacing (edited of course) on my local radio station, I was stunned. Being a Spineshank/Korn/Soulfly fan, this album blew me away with songs like (sic), eyeless, surfacing, and prosthectics. If you have a little extra money, pick up their Digi-Pack, which includes 6 extra tracks (demo's, remixes, live.) I like &quot;Get This&quot; particulary. Not only do they amazingly blend soothing/screeching D.J. mixes with pissed off screaming vocals, but the guitar and bass riffs are fast, blazing, and sometimes even melodic. If you're a KoRn/Spineshank/Soulfly fan, you must, I repeat, MUST pick up this amazing album. You will be very pleased you did.
B00PSLQYWE|5|Brilliant.
B000ZLJOW4|3|It is what it is. Mildly entertaining, a little weird but passes the time if there's nothing else to watch. Probably more like 2 1/2 stars.
B003L77GH4|5|Great Service, it came two days early and I was super excited when it arrived! I can't wait for season 4!
B00AREIAI8|5|This is a very interesting game.<br /> I love this game
B006885LZM|5|Very well done - like &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;, but in the Pacific theatre WWII.
B008LZHA3G|2|For anyone new to Dylan, please listen to his first album, and Blonde on Blonde, and Blood on the Tracks, and Time Out of Mind, or many others, before you buy this.  It's wonderful that he is still recording, but anyone who says it's one of his best is fooling themselves.  The songs are plodding, not lyrical, as in the best Bob Dylan.
B00IK1J9QM|3|Exciting and suspenseful as always
B00JVZ0DQG|3|Everything was awesome til last week. Now I'm stuck on the third stage of the wedding and it keeps giving me the same stupid pair of earrings!  I love this game, so please fix it. Also, a pop up says I need to restart for new content, but it just turns the wedding decor purple.
B00J0LH16Q|5|Just a perfect concert; great all around. The band sounds and looks great in this concert DVD. Joseph Williams is magnificent as the lead singer as is Steve Lukather and David Paich. Toto has mixed in professional musicians over the years to compliment their sound in studio and live concerts and the result is pure perfection. Grab this DVD and purchase the CD album as well for the car. The entire concert is covered on the CD as well; a lot of groups usually leave a couple of tracks off the CD, but not Toto. Looking forward to seeing them in concert this year as well as the new album. Music perfection= Toto.
B007MLDC2I|5|Outstanding, suspenseful film.  Rooney Mara is superb.

B008JDAC7G|3|This is a fun game from adultswim games, but the super version allows for more challenging play, power ups, and level ups.  It would be great if Super Monsters Ate My Condo was supported by kindle.  Is there anything someone can do about that?
0743290119|4|This is just like all the other single gal in NYC books. I love them all and I thought this was a good addition. It is a quick and easy read and was an overall good book. All these books start to blend in together after a while but I continue to enjoy new ones. It is a nice escape!
0062502182|5|Paulo Coelho's THE ALCHEMIST is a wonderfully charming book for anyone at any age. I received this book as a gift from a friend and a gift it truly is. This is the absolute book of following a dream through to the ends of the earth and discovering that what that dream is can change over the course of time.

B004TTHLBE|3|I had a love, hate relationship with this book.It dragged on too long, I was glad it was over, but on the other hand I did finish it.
B006ID6NDQ|5|Written very well.
B00ETHPJ1U|5|It's a treasure for me!
B000W93CXQ|1|I really wanted to like this book, but it just never got to a \\"real\\" place for me. Trust me, I had tough high school experiences myself and of course the thought of suicide came up on more than one occasion, but somehow I managed to suffer through it. Back to the book though...You hear about people writing suicide notes, but the premise that Hannah made multiple audio tapes full of these detailed accounts of events that she found to be the cause of her demise seems a bit far fetched. My opinion (because that's what these book reviews are for, right?) is that the idea for the book was very intriguing, but executed poorly. Possibly if it had focused more on Clay and had a bit less from Hannah it would have had a more profound effect. Oh, and also maybe rethinking what actually drove Hannah to kill herself. On a side note, there was a distracting comment about Clay being in contention for valedictorian that I felt added nothing to the story and seemed unlikely to be true. Good effort Mr. Asher, but I think this needed a more critical eye to look at it before it went to publication.  Truly...I hate giving bad reviews.
B00BEIYMZ6|5|i saw this movie with my friend and we both loved it! now we can sit and laugh with each other!
B005NFJAT4|5|I am a civil war buff and love this movie. I have done Civil War reenacting and actually know a few people in this movie
B005CMSDLE|5|We watched the trailers and were spellbound.  Too many movies today are essentially the \\"trailer\\", but not Hanna.  If i were ship wrecked on an island and could choose 10 movies, Hanna would be in the top 5.  The movie makes you think, and laugh so  hard, you might need a break for the toilet.  And if i could have Hanna with me on that Island life would be grand.  She is an innocent with skills and a mind set that trips you out.  She knows so many things that she doesn't even know she knows.  Hanna takes \\"home schooling\\" to a higher bar.  I hope they have a sequel.  Several sequels.  Watching Hanna on DVD tops the theater.  You can rewind to see a scene you thought you comprehended, but  as you re-watch, you see Hanna as the perfect person.  She is the Honey Badger of women.  You will not regret watching this.
0393035158|5|This book, in spite of the necessity to constantly go to the notes section, completely resonated with me.  As a scientist, I am duty bound to search for evidence to either support or reject various hypotheses.  The principles I use for my work also apply to my everyday life; it is just how I am wired, how I think.  I am unable to separate the two.  I think that Sam Harris has done an excellent job at explaining why this characteristic of my own behavior (which may or may not be shared by other scientists) is the way it is and why it should be applied to the non-work facets of our lives.  I think that it is possible to condense the thoughts here to a simple statement.  \\"If life is a book and you already know the ending, what is the point of continuing to read?\\"  I don't know the end of the book (in other words, I don't know the answers to the big life questions), but I am not willing to take it on another person's authority that they know the ending any better than I, because the ending is not \\"viewable\\" (i.e. technology doesn't exist to discover the answers, testable hypotheses aren't available, etc.).  Somehow, not knowing makes life worth living every day.  I am excited when I wake up in the morning because I get to go do science (something I really love) and the possibilities of finding something new are my driving force.  Surrendering to some concept which lacks evidence would somehow be antithetical to the way I have chosen to live my life, and would also somehow say that I felt like I or the rest of humanity lacked the intelligence and willpower to continue researching to find the answers.  Perhaps this is the most important part.  Humans are inherently inquisitive.  If we stop asking questions, somehow we stop being ourselves. <br /> <br />Read this book.  It will both enrage you and encourage you at the same time.  It will also make you think and most importantly, it will make you ask questions.
0761119752|5|Sandra Boynton does it again.  She knows the routine, she sets it up perfectly and bedtime is easier because of her efforts.  Our kids and grandkids loved these stories in a poetic rhyme.  Now we are giving them out as Godparents to our neat friends we help mentor along life's way.  Wonderful books!
B00H3NPER6|5|Best movie EVER!!!!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4|Play it all the time. My family also enjoy playing coin dozed. I would recommend this game to be added to your kindle.
0783230079|4|This is one of those thought provoking movies.  Everyone faces a crossroads in his or her lives that is a turning point.  Four people at those crossroads die prematurely before they are able to make a decision, and are fated to roam the earth until they resolve unfinished business.  Their only human contact to figure everything out is Robert Downey Jr.  The entire cast was actually very good, and well chosen - Kyra Sedgwick, Charles Grodin, Alfre Woodard, and Tom Sizemore give emotional heartwarming performances.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I like the chickens, Eddie
B00AHGSVKS|5|I can remember my high school English teacher's favourite word was \\"transcendent\\", which is exactly how I would sum up this book (as pretentious as that word is).<br />Looking past the fact that Childhood's End is now 50 years old and much of the technology and world perspectives are dated (though the predictions of the future are sometimes eerily accurate!), the themes are as timeless, but in a broad, worldly (literally universal) sense, rather than the nitty gritty of traditional character plots/motivations in most other novels.<br />The characters here are fairly dull, being products of their new environment, but that is partly the point. It works, and they remain relatable on a \\"rooting for the home team\\" level.<br />I'm sure like all great novels many people will have different opinions, to be endlessly discussed!<br />I found it a tiny bit slow in the middle section, but it is a fairly short novel so the plot flowed quick enough for me to pick it up again without any trouble after putting it aside for a couple of days.<br />Otherwise, this is a beautifully written classic which everyone should read (just don't try to adapt it for the screen unless you're Stanley Kubrick!)<br />-Peter Laurent, Author of [[ASIN:B00B95YRQ8 The Covert Academy]]
B00CW6DAKC|5|I love this game ...<br />If you get this game you can do things like plowing plots, sending gifts out to neighbors, and asking for things yourself, you can get animals too, pigs cows ostrich pigs<br />And a whole bunch of other things<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything so<br /><br />Bye!  😁😊
B008OOYALE|5|Thud game is one of my favourite game's to play on my kindle fire . It is so fun raising the dragon's. So I would get the game if I were you.
B000GW8RX4|5|A must have for any real metal fan.The holy trinity of Ronnie James Dio (the all time master) Blackmore,and Cozy is the end all be all,of all time.30 years old and this show is still a master work. After that line-up sadly Rainbow was no longer Rainbow. Thank God Dio still plays some of those songs live. Buy this DVD NOW!
B00004NHCC|5|Listening to this collaboration between Sarah Vaughan and Clifford Brown (among others) today makes you feel as if time stood still since it was originally recorded in 1954. Vaughan's voice is as crisp now as it will ever be and brings you a sense of what a truly timeless performance is and what art is all about. Packing classic after classic, you hear her perform jazz standards like it is the first time you've heard the songs, such as the case of \\"Lullaby of Birdland\\". Her wide ranging voice will simply never die and will continue to save a place for her in music history as one of the best singers ever.
B005KR6OBM|5|love it thanks
B003ZK58WM|1|My first issue with this book is the price. It's obvious that there is an adjenda against e books from this publisher. This price is a slap at the people who buy all books. It is a poorly thought out counter productive move.     My second issue is how very bad it is. My friend passed me his review copy because I like tomes. This book isn't writing it's typing. Poor plot, no depth. I got to page 282 before I gave up.      Don't buy this book.
0618680004|5|If, as a parent, you indoctrinate your children in a belief system based on no evidence of validity, and one whose perpetuation leads to more than less suffering for humanity--then you commit an act of child abuse, however unwittingly.  Dawkins develops the argument and answers the objections. You can evaluate his position by reading the book with an open mind.
B0099Y2MYK|5|Excellent series, glad I found the DVD on Amazon, that's what online shopping is all about! Quick- easy and the price was right!

B00MBEF1G6|5|This app is very much enjoyed by all ages, my son who is 2 and my niece who is 6 really enjoying playing and taking care of Toto.  My son really likes to watch the turtle dance, sleep, play, bath time & especially feeding him.  I know this is something that he will enjoy playing for some time. The only thing I would recommend is downloading on a bigger screen than a cell phone, it gives a better video and they don't have to squint their eyes.

0307951529|5|This is a great starter manual for solopreneurs. I really liked the business plan template. When I started my freelance/consulting practice, I didn't consider other ways I could make money from that venture, now I know that's something I should consider before I start. I also like the different examples of people starting businesses on a shoestring.
B00SI7GCJK|5|Incredible moive. Makes my heart race just thinking of the journey they went on. I wish i was them. Will watch again. Also this specfic one came with all three formats which is incredible too

B000B8IA2G|4|If you are looking at this page you are probably already familiar with the show, and if not, the other reviewers have covered the show's strengths and weaknesses completely.    I would like to talk about the dvd set itself.     First off, if you are concerned about the problems some of the others are having with the 5th disc, I read recently that it is a problem only in the Canadian release and not the U.S. release. I bought my copy from amazon.COM (as opposed to amazon.CA) and the 5th disc was just fine. So don't worry about that.    One thing that bothers me about this set is that there are no chapters for each episode except for the ones that let you skip the credits and the reviews of previous episodes. I find that very annoying. Sometimes it's nice to skip to a favorite scene without having to fast forward through the rest of the show to get there.    Also, unlike the dvd sets for SG-1, the dvd's come in the slim dvd cases which hold 2 dvds each. I don't particularly like these cases because I feel if I ever accidently step on one I am going to ruin 2 of my discs.They also don't hold the dvd's very securely and I think over time they will start dropping out of the cases when you open them. Sure, they take up less shelf space, but I'd rather not have to buy another set because a couple of the discs got broken.    The show itself looks great but the graphics they came up with for the beginning of each of the discs are fairly cheesy and not up to the usual standard of quality set by the stargate sg-1 releases.     The set is also a little light on extra's, although I love that there is commentary available for most of the episodes. The cast and crew all seem to have a great sense of humor and genuinely seem to like each other and have fun working with each other. It is very interesting to hear what went on behind the scenes for each episode. If you've never seen the show , don't listen to the commentary until you have seen all the episodes for this season becausethey do let slip with spoilers for shows later in the season.    BTW, one of the previous reviewers said:    \\"...you cannot return to the menu if you are in the middle of watching a show.\\"     That is incorrect; I had no trouble getting back to the menu from the middle of the show.    Still, you don't buy a dvd set to get the extras or a particular type of case, you buy the set for the show and this show is definitely worth the \\"price of admission\\".    Stargate Atlantis - 5 stars  This dvd release - 3 stars    Buy it, watch it, enjoy it.
B00IXF8PLU|3|A good movie, but lacks the emotional depth and complexity of character found in the book.
B001N26GFM|5|Alot of people comment on the 'sheltered' nature of the protagonist Bruno, and the childlike naievity he displays, and yes, I would say that the movie has its flaws...but in a larger sense, the movie is important in raising the issue of culpability in German society at large in regards to the Holocaust. It really makes one stop and think about how much, and what, the populance at large really knew about what was going on, and to what degree the wives and children of the men who were perpetrating this knew and how they dealt with it.. The Nazi propaganda machine was a very powerful force, anyone who has seen the films they produced as justification would agree that they are both evil and effective. SPOILERS-(The video made about the camps in the movie definitely made me think about those other propaganda films I had seen. One of the most haunting moments is when Bruno recognizes the stones from the propaganda film near the end.)While some parts of the movie are not incredibly believable... the overall issues they bring up are what is important. I have taken a lot of psychology courses that have dealt with cognitive dissonance and specifically with genocide and the Holocaust, and this movie is definitely a powerful force in bringing those issues to bear. Flaws or not, think it is something that everyone should see.....

B005CRQ4XI|3|Cheryl Strayed falls. She gets lost. She gets confused. Her boots cause her immense pain. She gets blisters, she loses toenails. She carries more than she needs. She runs out of water. She heads into town for supplies and encounters various situations, some good and some bad. She runs low on money. She is showered, occasionally, with kindness and occasionally takes a shower. She finds some beauty, gets into a rhythm, and ponders her past.<br /><br />The cover sold me--a beat-up, worn-down hiking shoe. That is a great cover. I thought I'd spend the entire book on the edge, eating nuts and berries and learning how a non-hiker and non-wilderness person survived a long trek up the Pacific Coast Trail.  But Strayed spends about half of \\"Wild\\" either getting ready for the trip, fixing problems in town along the way, or reminiscing about her personal history. So, be forewarned.<br /><br />\\"Wild\\" is as much interior journey as it is footsteps on the trail.  Strayed has a colorful past with lots of problems and issues and this makes for the many layers to the book.  There are memories of her father and her mother and her brother shooting a horse (probably the toughest scene to read in the whole book).<br /><br />Strayed has a good writing style. There is energy on the page. I read it easily. She pulled me along.  Other than cringing at all the mistakes made by a novice travelling alone in the woods, I really don't understand why she waited 17 years to put it together. That gap in time gives my journalism-trained brain some pause. She says she used extensive journals to write the book but, again, I wonder: why did she wait?<br /><br />The end was the biggest problem, at least for me.  Certainly, I hoped for some payoff--some nugget of from the navel gazing. Perhaps the 17 years was needed to process what happened, to look back and recognize the changes.<br /><br />It just didn't happen. The end of \\"Wild\\" comes quickly. She reaches Ashland, Oregon and then it feels like a flash to the finish.<br /><br />\\"Wild,\\" it turns out, isn't necessarily about where Strayed heads. It's as much about her as it is her environment. So, be prepared.h to the finish.<br /><br />\\"Wild,\\" it turns out, isn't necessarily about where Strayed heads. It's as much about her as it is her environment. So, be prepared.
B004UJAOLM|4|Love the archaic English. So quaint and so excellent a throw back to life nearly 150 years ago in the wet English moors. The bulk of the novel was filled with unhappy, angry and sickly folks that died all too soon. Their ill health must have been due to consanguineous relationships. It was nice that the story ended on a positive note. Finally we read of a happy couple of Earnshaw pairing with his cousin Catherine.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|Love it, would love if she would do more!!
B0002OERI0|5|I been reading the reviews for American Idiot and I am wondering what most of the people are talking about. Everyone seems to hate it just because it less punk and more pop than there past albums. If you want an album that is more punk go listen to Dookie and get over yourselves. American Idiot and Dookie are probably my two favourite Green Day cd's even though they are really different. I think American idiot is a great CD. It is a mixture of punk, hard and classic rock. Can you expect a band that's been playing for over fifteen years to stay the same. Billie Joe, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool are over 30 years old. They matured from there punk days. \\"Punk rock is dead...and I f---ing killed it\\" -Billie Joe even admits it.  The reviews goes from one idiot saying that Green Day should stay punk to another idiot (like Batman)saying that Green Day has released the same bumble gum pop thing over and over again. I don't know how you can call American idiot unoriginal.  I looked at Batmans other reviews and I saw the same that they pretty much wrote the same thing that they wrote about Green Day (say old boring story). Can this person come up with any original ideas for writing a review? In all his review all he does is winge about how bad they are. Is this guy queer or what?  Batman probably has some weird taste of music that alot of others wouldn't like.    Then I see some stupid kid that says that the story of this rock opera goes on about how St Jimmy and Wahtsername move to some haunted house. Somebody please tell what's wrong with this stupid kid or at least what he is huffing. Don't listen to that review they have no idea of the story of American Idiot. One of the most accurate review on her i s probably The Wiseguys which is found on the third page of the reviews    You should ignore these reviews that don't eaplain American idiot and just say wrong info or that its the same old pop crap.    Anyway, I leave you to read the other morons reviews and actually talk about American Idiot.    As you can see it is a rock opera anjd you've probably already read about what its about in the other reviews (as I have already sai The Wiseguy's review is really good). I brought this album for the first three singles that were released (which I thought were excellant) and found about how good the other songs are. I don't care what the retards that have written the bad reviews say I still think it's a good album. And apparently so does many other people cuz it won the Grammy for Best Rock Album of the Year in 2004.     It's not as if the whole album just pop as the other reviewers have said.St Jimmy is a fast-paced song that like other revieweres have said would seem to belong on one of their previous punk albums. Other songs I like for the speed are She's A Rebel and Letterbomb. It's not like the songs that are   more pop are about mushy crap as it may seem. Extraordinary Girl has a different sound to it that has never been heard before on a Green Day cd. Whatsername is a great song. I especially like the change in the rhythym from a soft song to a heavier song. Whatsername and Holiday are two of my favourite songs. I love the Holiday's lyrics and the introduction is great. I think it deserves more recognition than it's gotten. I never would have thought Wake Me Up When September ends would haven't gotten so much recognition. I think it's a great song but the video clip is overdone especially the beginning. We all love American Idiot and Boulevard and you'll probably love the other tracks too, unless you expect the same thing that they've been doing for the last 18 years. Green Day has changed (for the better) and leaves there punk roots to do something which is original and unexpected ( I don't know how people call American Idiot unoriginal. they probably need to actually licton to it and read the lyrics to find out it's a rock opera not just some anti-Bush Cd).     I recommend you check out Favourite Son A Green Day song that is on Rock Against Bush Vol. 2. That is an actual anti-Bush song. You should also check out The Offspring and Simple Plan, especially if you want more punk.     If you want softer rock you should check out Something For Kate.    \\"I think the little bush is a bit stupid and more or less the puppet of his old man.\\" -Billie Joe  \\"All my religious beliefs are based on Star Wars.\\" - Mike Dirnt  \\"It's fun until someone gets hurt...then it's halarious.\\" - Billie Joe    I got these cool quotes from [...]you should check it out.
6305342776|5|If it's sci-fi, I'll watch it!  The Black Hole is a movie I'll watch over and over again.  It may have gotten a bad rap, but I'm very pleased with it.  I'm surprised it didn't do better since I think most younger kids would really enjoy this movie.  The music soundtrack is also wonderful!
0446572764|5|Simply amazing story taking place in Russia 1950s. The writing is excellent and the story thrilling!  I was blown away!
B005IKZ60G|5|Guetta on this album far exceeds my wildest expectations for electronica.  Honestly, I'm more of a country-folksy type of listener, but I can't turn this album off from my MacBook. Each song is its own skillful composition, made by the clever layering of vocal tracks and electronic beats.  Some of my favorites from the album are the [[ASIN:B005IKZ73M I Just Wanna F. (Feat. Timbaland & Dev) [Explicit]]], which is a very catchy collaboration with Dev and Timbaland that sounds like one of those very seductive songs with its clean vocals and very thoroughly \\"frayed\\" (i.e. blurred, or less than clear) beats, [[ASIN:B005IX1T0E Where Them Girls At (Feat. Nicki Minaj & Flo Rida)]], which is one of those catchy songs that is played over and over again in the clubs which you should hate, but just can't bring yourself to do so (honestly, I've gotten more than a few stares just from the fact that I've shamelessly memorized the entire Nicki Minaj rap; it's just that catchy!), [[ASIN:B005IKZ6EW Turn Me On (Feat. Nicki Minaj)]], which is one of those songs with those hard, rough-n-ready club beats ready for the consumption.  Overall, this album somehow manages to woo me out of my typically [[ASIN:B0017PIADG Apple Tree]] style of music in lieu of a much more rough and electronic, and frankly, equally catchy, type of music.  Guetta on this album combines this skillful arranging skill, with the beauty of his featured artists, to help create a more whole composition of the album in general.
B007SGLZP8|5|I will admit to being totally confused a the end and had to go back and figure a few things out!  I liked that!
B0089LOG02|5|Although I do not know anyone who has been on an orphan train, I am familiar with journeys and new beginnings and feelings.  I feel that this book helped me to relive some of my own journey and the journeys of members of my family.<br /><br />This book tells the story of two lives -- a ninety-year-old woman orphaned right before The Great Depression and a sixteen-year-old growing up with foster families.  I feel as if I know these two women.  I hear their voices in my mind.
B00HPYMVD8|3|Seem like Will Robie and Jessia Reel series is coming to an end ...? Lacked the usual high octane energy very sedate action!
B00DR0PDNE|4|From a technology standpoint I'd probably rate this 3 stars, but it fits perfectly into how I wanted to use. If you're looking to stream everything from your mobile devices then you're probably not going to be entirely happy. If you're looking to stream YouTube on your TV from your phone then you'll really enjoy it. It works pretty well with the supported applications and formats, but don't expect any other magical compatibility.
B00CKJTVHW|4|I absolutely love Dexter. It is definitely one of my top three shows. Season 7 is still very good, but I think previous seasons were better, thus the 4 stars. It's still a phenomenal show.
B00EL6AAEU|4|This movie will change how you feel about Sea World.  Must see.  We watched this before our trip to FL and we ended up not doing Sea World on our vacation because this movie made us look at Sea World in a completely different way.
B00DUYUFZS|5|I read book after watching the movie.I must say the movie didn't do much justice to the book. But I cant decide whether its a good thing or bad. The movie would have been more powerful if was adapted as per the book. But the movie does a hell a lot of justice to the female lead &#34;Tiffany&#34; that the story does. While the movie is centered around 'Pat' and 'Tiffany's' explosive chemistry which makes it a great watch..the novel is more centered around Pat and the presence of Tiffany is a little too less for my liking. But like all novels this one too will move your heart like no movie can. I have never seen a full American football match in my life but I loved every second of reading about them. I never heard of Bonnie Tyler or Kenny G before but just to get into the full mood of the book, I dredged up Kenny G's 'Songbird' and Bonnie Tyler's &#34;Total Eclipse of the heart&#34; from Youtube and listened to them while reading which made the reading experience all the more powerful. Just imagining being in Pat's or Tiffany's shoes when listening to the lines and music of &#34;Total Eclipse of the heart&#34; is enough to make you give your heart out to them. The dance practice and the exhibition is narrated beautifully. The characters are described beautifully. Definetly a must read

The Six of Swords and the Five of Pentacles are among many of the images that encourage fresh insight.<br /><br />The colors are muted and dark rather than popping, which is why I gave 4 rather than 5 stars.

B00005N9CV|3|The cover featuring the very beautiful Diana Krall certainly will help sales. My apologies to her many fans as I must confess to not being one of them.  I am sure the enjoyment she seems to give people is real.  This is simply my take on her overall sound and impact.<br /><br />  Diana studied extensively with Jimmy Rowles and seemed to be on the inside early on when she was very young. With so much assistance and encouragement, she learned to play. She worked hard at it and it shows - you can only applaud that. However, the playing, IMHO, is not distinctive.  It sounds like good jazz piano but there is no unmistakable sound.  There is nothing that separates her playing from the fold.  Great jazz musicians develop a sound, a trademark approach, something unique and new.  You can easily tell Bill Evans apart from Monk or Peterson for example.  This is very competent playing but there is no signature concept or sound yet in her still young career.  Her singing can sound nice also, but she has no show stopping voice, nor show stopping style.<br /><br />  I do believe she will continue to develop and perhaps someday I'll eat these words.  I truly hope so!  In the meantime she is still in search of her own sound. Again, simply one mans opinion and I encourage you to take a listen.  We need more women in jazz and the piano - voice one two punch she possesses could still be a poignant force in the future.

0062009540|3|Remember that friend when you were in middle or high school that seemed absolutely perfect? The one who was always perfectly put together, that every girl wanted to be and every guy wanted to be with? Insert Alison here. She is one of five girls who are friends in seventh grade, along with Emma, Spencer, Aria, and Hanna. Only, these girls don’t just want to be her. They secretly hate her, too. Alison is not only the girl who they had sleepovers with, and talked about boys… she also knows each of the girls’ darkest secrets.<br /><br />Then, Alison disappears. And three years after her disappearance a lot has changed in each of the girls’ lives. They mysteriously begin to receive e-mails, text messages, and IM’s from someone by the name of A. They are each scrambling to find out who A is. Is it someone they already know? Are they being watched? Or, has Alison returned?<br /><br />&#34;Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.&#34;<br />-Benjamin Franklin<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the first book in the Pretty Little Liars series. It wasn’t the type of young adult book that I would normally read, but it was a nice break in-between some more serious books. So, if you need a break and want a lighter read (or are actually a young adult), this is a good choice. A “guilty pleasure” type of a read. One of the things that did keep me reading was that it wasn’t all superficial, as it felt at the beginning. There were serious issues that these girls had to deal with, that made it feel a little more “grown up”. I will likely read the second book in the series, but I won’t be rushing into it.
1416550550|5|Cassandra's grandmother is passing away at the beginning of the story and as she passes she whispers some mysterious words to Cassandra.  Cassandra soon begins a search for her grandmother's history as well as Cassandra's own.  Along the way, Cassandra will deal with demons that haunt her as well as the demons that have haunted her grandmother, Nell, all her life.    In 1913, Nell was found on a wharf in Australia by a kind and gentle wharf master.  He brings her home to his wife who wants children badly but has been unable to conceive.  On the eve of her 21st birthday, her father reveals to Nell that she is adopted and tells her what little he knows of her background.  He gives Nell a small suitcase that she was carrying when he found her on the wharf.    With the contents of the suitcase, Nell begins the search for her past but is waylaid in her search when, Cassandra, at the age of 11 is brought to her, by her n'er do well mother and Nell raises Cassandra.    Kate Morton has written a fairy tale of sorts with this novel.  In fact, one of the protaganists in the story is Eliza, who writes fairy tales and \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" is an adult fairy tale with undercurrents of darkness.  The story starts in the early 1900's in London when Eliza's aristocratic mother runs away with a sailor and leaves her children to fend for themselves in a tenement in London and the story moves to present day, England on the Cornish coast where Eliza lived in a small cottage with a forgotten garden.    Kate Morton writes a mesmerizing story that parallels the dark fairy tales that Eliza writes in her Cornish cottage by the sea.  There are some elements of surprise here although you will probably figure some of the secrets out before the ending.  This is well worth reading as are all of Kate Morton's novels.
B004YM6JI2|3|I have been watching SuperNatural for quite some time now and have enjoyed every season except the last 3 have not been good at all. Starting to get bored with it and don't think I will continue to watch or order this movie anymore.
B004SIIBGU|1|seemed like a very nice app at first,well sized for viewing on my kindle, can see what i am selling as well as searching.  that is until i bid on something i wanted to watch to see if i'd won---the MAIN thing anyone goes to ebay to do.  it's an incredibly laughably horrible oversight to exclude this.  i dont really care about items i won 2 months ago--shown brightly under my ebay. i want to see what i am bidding on and perhaps bid more if i'm outbid. whomever made this app obvouisly never used ebay.  just terrible.
B005IQZB14|5|Very enjoyable read for baby boomers for sure, except for the glorification of heroin. A really positive and beautiful story overall.
B006MW3UZW|5|this series has it all.  History, emotion, comedy (albeit British humor).  Great viewing for any age, background, or gender.  Must see
B00OKYQZDI|5|Five
B00GT4V5DM|5|Works great and even for android systems.
B009XIXVU6|3|My least favorite of the three books I read
B004SJ3BCI|5|I would recommend it to anyone who owns a Kindle Fire HD and to all of my family and friends.
B007TXN4TK|3|This game is entertaining for those who enjoy classical elementary music. Its challenging and fun. Its a lot better if you purchase the full version it has more songs and is more difficult.
B00ESNE696|5|Love this show! Was totally caught off guard with the Will/death twist!! I'm still recovering!!! It will definately keep me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next episode :)
B0087JTAKW|5|Very insightful, thought provoking and as usual well written.
B000TGJ8AS|4|Season 4 starts with Ziva being framed for murder, and of course only one person can save her GIBBS!!! Naturally Gibbs comes out of retirement to help an old friend, but don't be fooled. The last thing he wants is his badge back. Although eventually the Director does convince Gibbs to return to NCIS. But lets face it folks, we all knew it was gonna happen. Surprisingly not everyone on the team is happy to see Gibbs back. Speaking of team, we have a brand new probey, Lee who seems very timid until the episode she goes undercover.<br /><br />Now what I've noticed with all the seasons of NCIS is that there is always an underlined theme to the season. Last season was the \\"season of change\\" with the death of Kate, and the introduction of a new team member(Ziva) and a new Director(Jenny). This season for me was the \\"season of Growth\\". This season showed a lot of character development for the majority of the cast, love, as well as loss. Somehow while all the drama with our beloved NCIS special agents was going on, they actually managed to solve crimes.
B0090SI3EI|5|What can I say, my daughter loves this movie!
B00FATEJYE|5|It was 1 of my most favorite games ever
B005HSL626|5|You should download this game. P.S. What ever it says about the name of me it is lying. Its Liv.
B008JGSM6G|5|I dowloaded this game on a whim.  I was instantly hooked. Taught my 6 year old grandson how to play. Great skill for him. Now we are all hooked. Have fun!
6305627347|5|This is the best feature length film ever made.  Comedic geniuses Trey Parker and Matt Stone are at their finest.  They point out the fallacies and hypocrisy of our society.  The... poor parenting, that is widely accepted, is displayed in it's true form. The music is superb and the Disneyesque overtones are fantastic.  <br />Displaying Satan as a likable battered &quot;spouse&quot; is a master stroke of Biblical accuracy.  The mothers blaming Canada for their children's behavior is incredibly insightful of today's parents.  <br />The government, schools, medical profession, entertainment industry, church, and family are all under attack in this movie.  And for all the right reasons.  <br />Definitely a must see!
031632406X|5|Incredibly heatbreaking and inspiring. These Navy Seals: Lieutenant Michael Patrick Murphy, Marcus Lutrell, Mathew Axelson, & Danny Dietz are Men of Honor.  They are deserving of the highest respect.
0394806220|4|My son really enjoys this book and he is 2 1/2.  He has a lot of books.  It is not on his fave list but he listens to the entire book at bedtime.
B00005QGAZ|5|Bought this for my sister in law as a gift and she loves it she is always playing it many thanks
B00B5HQLMI|4|it's good, but it's not your typical espionage james bond movie.  there's lots of action to make it modern type
B000I5X824|5|Thank you
B0083TXXZ4|5|This is an awesome nerf product! War games has reached a new level with this beast. Be sure to buy extra ammo clips and a ton of ammo as you will go through it much faster than a regular nerf gun.

B005CRQ4GU|5|I guess it was...............  awesome awesome awesome I have least read it like about a hundred times it is not as good as other ones it is better
B003PVPXOE|5|Gives you the sense that, even if life isn't predetermined by physics... just knowing that there is a beginning and an end limits the possibilities.
B00004U8H4|5|As long as your not a concrete thinker, and your thoughts travel beyond your nose, then you'll love the movie. Anyone seeking for an amazing adventure would love this movie. I would say, that if you've seen A Clockwork Orange, you would adore this movie. This movie was brilliant, and you have to think to understand this. If you really analyze the movie, it really shows how perverse and twisted up people in America can be. Definatly buy this movie!!!
B004TI5N38|5|I could not put it down.  Fast moving action with many unexpected turns along the way. I would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense writing.
1419701533|5|My 1st grader wanted this series because his 4th grade friend had it.  Because my son is an avid reader, I decided to purchase the series.  There is some humor that is a little sarcastic that is geared to an older reader.
B00EMXBDMA|5|This is a very good book and I am thoroughly enjoying reading it.  It is very well written and makes you feel like you are there next to Mark Watley.  Very well written and funny.
B00000GAIW|5|Always liked this album. Best I think  they ever did. My granddaughter plays a flute and loves the flute solos on this CD
B0066WJLU6|4|Good light
B00AREIAI8|5|I loved it because is fun
B003VANOFY|1|I waited about 2 years to write this review; this headset is the most frustrating piece of garbage ever produced.  The constant disconnects and reconnects are bad enough, but when the headset reconnects it does not remember your saved settings, so the sidetone gets reset to 20% and you can't hear yourself speak at all.  I am constantly alt+tabbing out of games to pull up the software and manually set the sidetone to 50% every single time the headset disconnects/reconnects, which can be upwards of a dozen times in just 30 minutes.<br /><br />I am going to shatter this thing within the week, and it will be soooo satisfying.  Your days are numbered you little gremlin.
0312360266|1|I haven't finished the book because I could barely handle the ridiculous, \\"Oh my gosh!\\" theme throughout the book.  Maybe this book is good for 10-12 year olds--oh but wait, maybe it is too mature for them during the sexual (BJ) moment and other sexual and drug related moments/contents.  So that is why I'm confused, is this book for mature audiences or pre-teens?  I'm embarrassed that I purchased this book because the cashier must have thought I was nuts.  I'm too old to read a book like this and I'm not sure who I could give it to since it seems to invasive for anyone under 16.  This book was a waste of time, paper and space. Yuk!
B0054JZC6E|5|its a great game!!!!!!!! =] hope your up for a challange and hope you have paitents! Cuz a lot of these games are hard and come with great aggravation!
B002JXK5VU|5|Good fun.
B004SOR4H6|5|I had been going online to access twitter but recently installed the app.  Gosh it is so much better than viewing it online.  Feeds update faster and more tools that what you could do online.  Thrilled!
B00004NRWH|2|Two songs: \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Leader of Men\\".  Those are the best two songs on here, and both get old really quickly.  All of the songs basically sound the same, and don't exactly leave you with a good impression.  Don't get me wrong here- Nickelback is a great band, I just don't like this CD.
B004VYYA2K|4|Great for storing all your Barbies.
B002HJ9PTO|1|The static was louder than my voice.  It is definitely not a good microphone for podcasts, etc.
B00IEG0JOY|5|With the limited memory space of my tablet, and the need to have certain items be available on different machines, this app, and one note in general, is something I use regularly.
B00BB8SKPW|4|Great movie but very intense from beginning till end. Had to watch a comedy afterward so I could sleep that night.

B004478GNI|4|My son loves this toy, it isn't very sturdy so I imagine I'll be helping him fix it quite often.  The side wings/guns move around giving him something to play with which makes a big difference over a completely static toy.  He also has a Lego set of a bulldozer that he remade into a spaceship (at half the cost) that he plays with just as much.  However as someone who grew up on Star Wars it was tough not to get him one when he asked since it was a birthday present.  Overall I would recommend it if you want/need the brand, otherwise I would get a larger \\"plain\\" Lego set for the same money, they wind up making it into whatever they want anyway.  That's what I see myself doing unless it is a special occasion like a birthday.

B00CFA222M|4|This movie was suprrizingly good. Somehow I thought it would be sillier and less exciting than it was.  It's mostly an action movie.  My family and I liked it quite well.  We decided we would buy it if we ever found it cheap.  Then we did.  Thanks, Amazon.
B009FZHYKU|5|My whole family loves the Walking Dead Series from episode 1, with every episode leaving you wanting more when they end. So much has already happened when episode 4 ended of the new season, I can't imagine what the finale will be?? BUT I can't wait to find out.

B00HV2KPNW|5|I grew up in the early 90's and I think this is one of the first Disney movies since the Lion King that really got back to what was great about Disney movies.  There is a lot of great jokes in this movie that made it entertaining for the adults that watched it too.  Overall it was a great movie.
B008P1EWIM|5|Downloaded it using it love it I retired the other weather app I was using love the background compared it to other it's faster than other one<br />Wish I could set it up with my area on the radar but that's minor<br />Love it!!!
B00000IPAX|1|very dull album. what we have here is a very formulaic, prefabricated mtv joke band. the lyrics are horrible, of course. blink 182 is basically an  experiment gone awry. wanna try some REAL rock? listen to green day[ who  blink rips off extensively, and who happen to be excellent muscianas who  have been doing this music game for over 11 years now[ blink's got a good  year, year and a half on them...], my bloody valentine, the red hot chili  peppers, nirvana, sonic youth, the beastie boys, or the smashing  pumpkins.......avoid blink 182 at all costs
B008476HBM|5|I just loved reading this book. Though initially little too much to understand considering the old English. But as one starts comprehending its a gem. Extremely nice writing, superb story and lovely characters. A classic indeed.
B00Y6QF0PE|4|I saw the mixed reviews and I was hesitant to read this, but it does help to fill in the gaps from the first book. I recommend it for any 50 Shades fan!
1400049628|5|Listen...    I'm not a huge horror fiction fan, but this was very well done...Just like a proper survival manual, FUNNY! And, the short accounts of attacks at the end were chilling and well written. Were zombies medically possible, Max Brooks would have sold me on this completely. Well done.
0316067598|5|Absolutely excellent story and easy to read!
B005HEK3JW|5|I remember watching some of the episodes when I was growing up but was not able too see all of them. Sense Amazon Prime I now can watch all of the season of Star Trek Next Generation and its even better than I can remember. They don't make many shows like this anymore.
6305949980|5|This will be one of the Christmas classics in your house. This movie delivers the meaning of Christmas with romance and a little thriller. This is a movie your kids will watch over and over again. Now lets not forget the special features. The behind the scenes footage is phenominal. The featurettes were interesting, and the deleted scenes were so funny you'll laugh your head off.(literaly) This is a great buy for any kid above 5. Go ahead, laugh your head off. Idare you.
B00F1J3G9C|5|It is amazing that the application connects using webmail and provides features supported by exchange.
B00DUGCLY4|5|Nice app really fun
B006LSZECO|5|Once I began reading this novel, I had an idea of where the book was headed and who the characters were. Then everything was turned on heads and I was left wondering who the characters truly are and what has actually happened. I loved that Flynn did this and I was completely engrossed in the story line. It reads really well and I found myself laughing out loud at times. There is a lot of discussion about how the books ends and people feeling dissatisfied with the ending, but I think it was a befitting ending. It wasn't a Hollywood ending or one where we see justice served, but it was believable and in line with who the characters are. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys clever characters and good writing.
B005OCFGTO|4|Seriously. The only review I have is that I love Harry Potter.<br /><br />DISADVANTAGE: This set is not the extended version set....the theatrical set and I was caught off guard by that when complete scenes that I had watched before were not in the movie...the movies were much shorter and less exciting.
B00JFGMXAU|3|Evidently, you do get access to 37 downloadable MP3 files which are book related. There are 16 files relating to Retrurn of Sherlock Holmes, 13 Agatha Christie files, and 21 HP Lovecraft files  for a total of 31 MP3 files.  There is also at least 1 ebook of Agatha Christie.<br /><br />So, there is some truth and some fiction to this download of alleged great fiction :-). At least, it was only $0.99 that went.<br /><br />Happy reading and I hope to be helpful
B0017SWPXY|5|I loved this book. Read it continuously and finished it in one day.  I tend to read good books that way.  I liked that it was written from the perspective from a dog, so different.  It was a story that made me laugh out loud some times and cry others.  You will love this book!
B00EF460ME|5|this is a great app to add to your mp3 player on your phone if it dosent have a EQ built in,my last two phones don't have a EQ and I cant get that deep rich bass and customized sound I need that my ear is trained to,this app does everything it says and you will consider that1.99 well spent, check it out, its a must if you are into sound quality!!!!!!!!!
0399157565|3|I keep hoping for vintage Scarpetta to resurface, but that is not to be it seems.<br /><br />Evidenced here is a mish-mash of dysfunctional relationships between Scarpetta & all those closest to her. I hate that Benton has been made to appear like a mere appendage. Scarpetta is acting like a victim, really, in her position, this so unlikely & unattractive.<br /><br />She has made all her characters so horribly jaded & unpleasant it's hard to digest. It's impossible to feel the slightest connection with any of them anymore.<br /><br />I found the murder mystery story line interesting up to a point & then was completely flabbergasted at the end. All I could think was `HUH?\\" What a let down. It made absolutely no sense.<br /><br />Having been so taken with Dr. Kay Scarpetta from the very beginning I am sad to see the series disintegrate into this shambles. Having said that, this novel is much better than the last 2 or 3 or 4 but then, that's not saying much.
B00M25DDQE|1|Save your money. Here's a simple accurate review. ABSOLUTE CRAP!!
B009KYXEY6|5|I liked most of the songs on this album and knew that I had to buy them. I couldn't stop listening to it. I was so anxious for her next album, and I'm glad it came.
B00AAQHP66|5|This is a beautiful heart warming story.<br />I don't know why it wasn't rated higher.<br />Probably because there is no violence in this movie.<br />This is a real story. Great heroic person who loved to surf.<br />His memory lives on to this day.
B005I1AQ14|5|I love this movie and when I went searching for it on DVD found the studio has not released it in a format usable in the USA, only PAL format for region 2 (Europe). This is one of my all time favorite movies because of the plot, characters (especially Edgar and Virginia Madsen), and incredible music!
B0067Q42BY|5|Easy to enjoy
B002U0KHMY|3|I am lazy about watching the DVDs I purchase, so I have not yet watched the DVDs in this season of White Collar, partly because of the Neal/Kate thing.  I don't enjoy that kind of thing because I feel it interrupts the plot.  I am very plot- and action- driven in what I read and watch.  I want to get past it and enjoy Neal Caffrey as I enjoyed him in the fourth season, which is the only season of White Collar that I have seen.  Instant addiction!!  I plan to purchase every season of this show as it is issued on DVD.  BTW, Matt Bomer should be the only choice to play Christian Grey in that movie!
B004DI7HZ6|5|I really got into this book, but the ending was a little disappointing. However, I can see how it leads right into the next book in the series so I am planning on starting it right away.
B005K17RU0|5|This App works great on my Kindle Fire and my Droid X.  Simple to navigate through features allowing you easily setup of modify locations.
B00MEOD4KI|4|the movie was ok, i did enjoy most of it.  will arnett helped make this movie more enjoyable for me and the turtles werent bad either.  i just wished there was more character interaction between the turtles and more scenes with them in it.  i think the all-cgi turtles film years back had more character development than this one.  for the record, for all its goofiness, the original is still my favorite(wish that one had a special edition release).<br /><br />if you did like this version though, the target blu-ray/dvd special edition may be the one to go with.  you get:<br /><br />*  feature film on blu-ray with special features, dvd copy, digital copy, and bonus blu-ray of extras.<br />*  your choice of a specific ninja turtle cover.  i thought leonardo looked the coolest, but i went with donatellos due to the extreme purple nature.<br />*  a target ticket rental offer.<br />*  a bonus blu ray disc of extras( about 30 minutes i think, havent watched it yet)<br />*  a coupon for a free pizza/drink combo at target food avenue.  get it?  the turtles like pizza so they...oh nevermind.  you could probably peel this off in the store and redeem it without buying the movie, but that would probably be frowned upon by the turtles.<br />*  a free mask (mine was red despite me picking donatello).  i havent torn it out of its plastic wrapper though cause this baby is going up on ebay for $200-300, so watch out for that turtle fans;)<br />*  that's about it.  i just wanted to see if you were paying attention or made it this far.<br /><br />overall, 3-stars for movie rounded up to 4 for a very special edition which was on sale for $18 last week, and is now on sale for $15 this week at bullseye central!?!  price adjustment, here i come!
B0040GSVH4|5|good album
B009LDD5E0|5|Awesome show!!! My daughter loves this show!!!
B004N66XYE|3|Not many episodes.  Overpriced for con taint.  I have all of the original Up/down on tape ( yes I have working VCR's).<br />The original gets  5 stars, this 2 and a half!
1400032717|5|I could not put this book down and look forward to more from this author. <br />
B000V6BE6C|1|Hey if you think listening to korn, nickleback, and three days grace is cool then I would recommend you pick up this horrendous, awful, and embarrassing record.  If your a bone-head who thinks the war in Iraq was a great idea and your favorite beer is bud heavy (even though you know it is awful), and if you just started another cycle of HGH rush to the stores immediately to pick this hot one up! I know I have just formed a gross stereotype of people who might potentially enjoy this record but I could not have done it without Avenged Sevenfold's willingness to belong to this stereotype.  I mean is this the first record besides Toby Keith's to defend the war on Iraq? Fred Durst would even think these guys are retarded meat heads. He would \\"break stuff\\" knowing that there are idiots bigger than him in the world.  This band was actually once innovative believe it or not. I remember hearing \\"second heartbeat\\" on a subcity compilation (one of the hopelessly devoted to yous) and thinking wow this band has done something really interesting.  They literally brought so-cal melodic hardcore sounds and mixed them seamlessly with classic 80's style thrash, and all the while, molding them into giant rock opuses.  Music fans everywhere shed a tear b/c those days are long gone and I am sad to say I liked this band at all. I even chose to watch their set at warped tour instead of watching taking back sunday and bad religion playing back to back (in retrospect a god awful decision). I mean seriously if one was to make a film about the downfall of America culturally and intellectually I would start with an introduction by Bill O'Reilly, and the soundtrack of the film that followed would be provided by these inbred mutants (we could also insert some trivium and stone sour if you want as well). Seriously if I was millionaire, I would pay each and every one of you to not buy this record because IT IS AWFUL. Also, if you were wondering how long it took me write this review don't worry ITWAS ALMOST EASY. I just cut and pasted half of it from a review I wrote  about disturberd's new record, MAN!
B0031KC8OC|4|the story is great the characters were interesting a good tv show unlike now a days great detective show .
B005IF5H2S|5|I play this album 3-4 times a week. Just like their previous album, the musical arrangements blow me away. You would swear they have a complete orchestra performing with them. The lyrics are first rate, making the album one you will play over and over.
B009EE4T8C|5|7 Academy Award winner  what else needs to be said
0440419514|5|While I had already read the entire trilogy, upon re-reading it I realized it was so worth it. The writing is impeccable, Pullman really knows how to tug at one's mindstrings. Although, definately NOT for those who struggle to look outside the box. Also, I would be slow to reccomend this book to someone that is very religious and won't appriciate reading a story about a land that could or could not be real. Overall, simply enthralling and wonderful.
0553208845|4|Siddhartha was an amazing book.  I had a difficult time starting to read this and trying to get into it since it was required for a college class.  However, Siddhartha's story started to unfold and I found myself wondering what he would experience next and where his journey would lead.  His search for inner peace through so many situations was fantastic and I realized that we can all relate to this search.  It helped me understand that the journey for inner peace is not an easy one but is worth it when it happens.  I definately recommend this to others.
B00F87ZUYG|5|I am completely hooked on this story. You get so attached to these characters, but you really can't bet on any of their lives. S*** is crazy!
B00DJFIMW6|4|I love the game but have not been able to download the last 2 updates and now I cannot even open the game to play, just keeps me in a loop for the upgrade
B00A9X9ORI|4|Not a bad movie, but very slow at times...Wish it had more special effects like other Bruce Willis' movies. Any takers?
B000002HEP|5|Ok, it's official. This is the best Kyuss album. No doubt about it. Josh Homme's low-tuned riffage, Scott Reeder's Geezer-ish bass lines and fills, Brant Bjork's energetic drumming, and the stoned voice of John Garcia all combine into one energetic groove of an album.<br /><br />From the opening notes of \\"Gardenia,\\" this album grabs you and never lets go. There are different atmospheres throughout the whole cd. With songs like \\"Supa Scoopa\\" and \\"Whitewater,\\" the feel is agressive, yet mellow too. Other songs like \\"Space Cadet\\" feels like a calm wind blowing by. Other tracks like \\"Conan Troutman\\" and \\"100o\\" are pure agression. Yet there is a cohesive flow to the whole record.<br /><br />While some people might complain about the album being tacked onto 3 tracks, I love it. I think that each part has a powerful beginning, a cool middle, and an explosive ending. It works on that behalf.<br /><br />So, if you're interested in entering the world of Kyuss, get this album, or their other masterpiece, Blues For The Red Sun. You can't lose.
B0002O7XW2|5|Always love love love watching this movie. Came to me in the plastic and in great condition!
B00HV2KU5A|5|Great!!!!!
B00E8KLWB4|3|It's a good game, just wish it didn't have any limits. But I have enjoyed it thus far. It also does not hurt that it is free.
B008673ZAQ|4|:)
B0000C7PRY|5|This album is just beautiful.  The music is beautiful, the story is beautiful, the lyrics are beautiful, Everything about this album is beautiful.  Morse has really pushed the envelope with this album.  Portnoy's drumming is awesome, and Morse's use of orchestral instruments is really cool. It is the most spiritually uplifting CD I've ever heard. If you are worried about how preachy the album is, you have no need to worry. The story that Neil tells is presented in a very honest, uplifting down to Earth way that is not forcefull or imposing. This album with Feel Euphoria is evidence that Neil is Spock's Beard. If you were slightly (or like I was, monumentally) disappointed with Spock's Beard's Feel Euphoria, I would strongly suggest buying this album because it will not let you down.
B007SNMVH2|5|Thrilling and exciting
B00JVZ0DQG|5|Very fun game to play. My 6 year old daughter loves to help out!!! I recommend it to all ages!!!
B003L77G2Y|5|This is a fun-to-watch series.  I recommend it if you like twists and turns ...
B006GLM5EQ|5|Love this series; wish I could watch all the seasons. This is the only Vamp series I like.
B00HDMMISA|4|Big Little Lies<br /><br />This is an interesting look into people's lives and has a really surprise ending.
0312330537|4|I'm by half of this book, recommended to all traveling to India, especially Mumbai.<br />I liked it because it's true and the author seems to have a very good grip and understanding of the culture.
B0012QE4Q2|5|Great and very interesting movie. It arrived in two days. I loved the movie. Thank you.
B0081SRJSY|3|I've written to the developers about this but haven't heard back or seen improvements. The game is fun however it's not accurate in keeping track of your achievements... For example,  Unbeatable where you need to beat at least 3 computer opponents. I've won several times. ... More than 5 times to achieve the badge but it'll say I've won once then twice then three then go back to once then go up to two then back to one. ... I had it up to four finally then won again but the achievement was back down to once. Please fix as this is not only unfair but makes the game unfun.
0385338724|5|I have read and loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. I looked forward to this one, and it did not disappoint. As all of her books have been, it was a quick read - one I didn't want to put down.
B00MJ114YE|5|Well done Doctor Who amalgamation.  Have watched three times!
B000244FDW|3|In my opinion, there are only two adaptations of P&P worth watching: this one and the 1995 miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. The other ones suffer from shortness. The essence of P&P is not the love story; it is the portraying of a society and its manners and virtues, and you cannot do the book justice in a two hours movie. Thus, I will consider only these two versions in my review. <br /> <br />The 1980 version is, in a way, truer to the book. It changes only some minor details and does not add anything that is not in the book - the 1995 version adds three scenes at least, with the intention of better explaining the character of Darcy to a modern audience.  <br />In fact, it has the air more of a theater play than of a movie, in the style of all BBC series of the time. Darcy is just as handsome and stiff as in the book, Lizzy just as witty. Many dialogues are exactly as in the book, and some narrative passages are included by way of characters meditating.  <br /> <br />But most of the other charaters just don't match. Mr. Bingley is very, very dull and in no way does justice to the book character, which was funny and engaging. Mr. Bennett was another big disappointment, he always seems so unhappy and serious, when in fact he is a man who assumes and accepts his own decisions and mistakes and tries to make the best of them. Wickham shows his true colors in his face and manner right from the beginning, he looks just the scoundrel he is, is is hard to imagine how a sensible girl like Lizzy did not see right through him. He, and especially Lydia, are not expanded well enough, thus their elopement comes out of thin air.  <br /> <br />The only exception were the Gardiners, who look just as in the book. <br /> <br />Lady Catherine will come as a shock to those of you used to the 1995 version, because she is a very different person. Where the 1995 one was perpetually bored and in slow motion, and old, the 1980 one is younger, agile and sparkling. Both interpretations are equally valid, I guess, I cannot decide which one I like best. <br /> <br />As to Darcy and Lizzy: I know Jane Austen never said that Lizzy was beautiful, just that she had very \\"fine eyes\\", but I always felt that she was the kind of person who more than made up for that by her wits and spirit. Lizzy was passionate, and in this movie she is not. (In the discussion with Lady Catherine, she doesn't lose her temper even once.) She acts very well rehearsed lines, but does not get into the character. Or perhaps she just isn't Lizzy as I have pictured it. She and Darcy have no chemistry at all. Chemistry might be a modern concept for the XIXth century, but still, you would like your hero and heroine to look like they belong together, and these two do not. That is even more true for Jane and Bingley, which look like they belong in different movies. <br /> <br />My opinion may be biased because when I first watched this mini series, I had already watched the 1995 version at least 5 times, and to my mind, the characters, dialogues, places and events were well fixed. To me, it was like walking into a familiar house and finding all things just slightly out of place. I felt the impulse to go and put everything back like it was. I guess to any viewer, her favourite of the two will always remain the one she watched first.
0062238868|5|It seemed extremely realistic, not only in the battle experiences but also in his personal life.<br />He did an excellent job telling his story.
B000W94FIW|5|Loved it.
B00634GHJA|2|While this app does what it says, and does it just fine, but sharing with Picassa or E-Mail via the standard Gallery app is easy enough that I find this app redundant.
