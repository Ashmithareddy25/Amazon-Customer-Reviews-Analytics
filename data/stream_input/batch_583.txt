B000E8N690|4.0|Walk The Line shows the legendary singer, Johnny Cash, during his impressive career. This movie will keep you entertained from start to finish and will only make you want to see it again and again, it's that good. With stars like Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon portraying Johnny Cash and his wife, June Carter, this movie is filled with powerhouse performances. <br /> <br />Walk The Line is unique and entertaining because it has all the singers actually sing their own songs instead of editing Cash's own voice into the movie. Reese Witherspoon took singing lessons and really shines in some music scenes as she sings for audiences in the movies. Pheonix shows he can sing too and gets the crowds going so well you can't help but tap your foot along with the music. <br /> <br />The acting is great also, as every character adds their bit into the movie to make you feel as if you were witnessing Cash's life when he was still a young man. Some great scenes have him starting to sing for a record company and sing about his problems with the air force and his lifestyles. <br /> <br />The movie starts off with Cash as a young man back in Arkansas who is noticed for his unique voice and how he sang about different topics that normally would create controversy and disbelief with people. His life takes a turn for stardom as he takes a tour around the country and meets up with June Carter, who he later starts a relationshp with. <br /> <br />Reese Witherspoon was absolutely wonderful as a young woman who was great to every fan who talked to her and went out of her way to start a conversation with anyone who asked for an autograph from her. She and Cash had a rocky relationship as they both fall for each other, become disgusted with each other as Cash's drug problem gets out of control, and eventually agree to marry one another in a great scene where Cash proposes on stage in a show in Canada.  <br /> <br />It's great seeing how Cash became famous for his singing, and we also see greats he is travelling with such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley. I also found the scenes with Cash dressing up all in black and his performance inside the prison the best scene of them all, with Cash taking his hat off to the inmates who have to drink horrid, brown looking water. <br /> <br />This is one movie you need to see to understand how great it really is. Phoenix and Witherspoon are fantastic, the singing is wonderful, and the entertainment is off the charts. <br /> <br />Extras: <br /> <br />10 deleted scenes <br /> <br />commentary by James Mangold, the co writer and director of the movie <br /> <br />Plus More!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I often enjoyed Cash for not only not caring if he didn't fit the \\"country and western paradigm\\" but he was also double hard and didn't care who knew.  He seemed to be perfectly capable of transcending all boundaries, even to people like myself who normally can't stand country. <br /> <br />Yes, it's a fine day when all us \\"S&M influenced Depeche Mode listeners\\" sit around at a party dressed in black and New Rocks start singing with Johnny Cash to \\"Hurt\\" at a part (full of drugs and sex and violence and sacrificing of chickens to the devil...*eyeroll*).  I suppose Mr Fire-And-Brimstone forgets Cash himself was jailed twice for drug use.  I suppose in Ohio they are without sin, hence they can cast stones... <br /> <br />The good thing however is Cash himself never bothered to label.  He never beat someone over the head with his own biblical interpretation and understood - as it seems some people don't - that music from the heart, from the roots of the soul, is still music, no matter who is singing it.  Like it or not, Johnny Cash singing \\"Hurt\\" worked because those lyrics meant something to him. <br /> <br />So go ahead, take a chance on the album, give a listen even if you never thought you'd ever pick up anything country-and-western - and if you live in Ohio, move somewhere where you won't have to deal with the nutters.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I think it's sad that a lot of people because of their conservative narrow-minded views, are going to miss out on a beautiful piece of cinema like Brokeback Mountain. When I heard all of the buzz surrounding this movie, I had to see for myself what all of the fuss was about. I must admit, I was reluctant to purchase the video at first due to my own conservative attitudes. But I am glad I changed my mind. If you enjoy nothing else about Brokeback Mountain, the breath taking cinematography alone is worth the price of the video. Heath and Jake give stellar performances in this movie and they deserve every award they received even if they didn't receive the oscar. It takes true actors to pull off a role like this and these guys more than deliver. The power of Brokeback  Mountain lies not in what Ennis and Jack say and do to each other, instead it lies in what they don't say and do. The silence is so loud in this film. From the very first scene when they first meet, they never even say hello. They never really make eye contact but instead steal nonchalant glances at each other. This scene sets the tone for the entire movie. Even the most naive person can see the chemistry between the two men. Throughout the entire movie their feelings are never verbally expressed. For instance neither Jack nor Ennis ever say the words \\"I love you.\\" Again it is in their silence that they say the most.  Some people condemn the movie as promoting homosexuality. First of all sexuality can not be promoted. If a person is gay or straight they were probably that way all along. Watching a movie would not influence them one way or the other. Others lament over these guys getting married and raising kids while maintaining their relationship. Yes, infidelity is wrong and it always will be wrong. But it has existed since the beginning of time and will continue to exist forever. If you would lay down your fundamentalist gavel and see the film with an open mind, you can no longer deny its brilliance.You don't nessesarily have to agree with the subject and contents of a movie to enjoy it. I for one can enjoy a movie for what it is. Just that, a movie and nothing more. I am proud to have this film as a part of my video collection and you will too. Anyone with half a heart and an ounce of compassion will be moved by this piece of cinema. I gotta admit however I was a bit disappointed with the ending. I thought the movie would have been even more moving if Ennis had honored Jacks final request and spread his ashes on Brokeback. But I'm not the director. Maybe mister Ang lee thought it was best to leave this way. But can you just visualize an emotionally stricken Ennis on horseback riding into the sunset with his lovers ashes being tossed into the winds on Brokeback Mountain. I felt this would have given the movie an ever more powerful emotional impact. It was also unclear to me as how Jack was killed. Did he die the way his wife says or was he severely beaten to death? Despite these minor technicalities the movie is still worth seeing. Give Brokeback Mountain a chance and I guarantee by the end of the film, after wiping away tears, the only word you will be able to utter is \\"Beautiful\\".
0345475674|3.0|Pompeii is in the tradition of the best historical novel.  Set right in the period of time right before and through the eruption of Vesuvius, Pompeii is told from the point of view of the water engineer for a nearby town.<br /><br />Harris portrays a period in Roman history.  He has done enough research to make the people and their culture come to life.  His writing is adequate to the task but not brilliant--but who cares--this book is a lot of fun and a quick read!
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|I hear these movies take 3 to 5 years to make. That would make one assume that the script would consist of more than drawn-out stuttering, lame jokes, old songs and every cliche known to man repeated over and over. Now I like kiddy movies. I do. I thoroughly enjoyed Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and the Shrek movies. They were witty, humorous, intelligent and cleverly made to play to all ages. Not so with Chicken. The plot needed to either hold together or entertain - both preferably, but it suceeded in neither.<br /><br />While the animation was very good, they overdid facial expressions and gestures, as if proud of themselves for their abilities. Rightly so, but subtlety is what makes it look real, believable.<br /><br />The main problem I saw was lack of originality. They had obviously been watching Nemo and Shrek in the key moments of script and plot writing. But the father/son motif fell short of moving and wandered into the painful-to-watch relm. The \\"sly\\" allusions to other movies were not only outdated, but presented in such a \\"please laugh hysterically now\\" fashion that I simply rolled my eyes.<br /><br />Kids will like it, but kids like Scooby Doo and Herbie too.<br /><br />With such creative characters and invenite plotlines as Nemo, Incredibles and Shrek, I would have been more than a little chicken releasing this foul mess.
B00006I53S|5.0|I've had this lens for almost 2 years now - first for my 300D and now for my 350 XT.  I find it super-sharp, even at full zoom and wide open.  The IS feature is good to have and is fairly quiet.  Fairly compact lens and easy to take everywhere - I use this most of the time, even for landscapes.  I will use the kit lens for indoor shots, or when a wider angle needed in landscapes, but the 28-135 is sharper throughout its range.  I would highly recommend this lens.
0439673631|5.0|This film I have heard many bad comments about it such as: \\"Boring, Not the best, Rubbish Story etc\\" I never got the Chance to watch it in the Cinema, so I said I would buy it when it is Released on DVD.  I have bought it and its Fantastic its on for 2hrs 59 minutes which is a long film but Hey its Fantastic, Most say its like \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" NOTHING like it, If it was the same I would have fallen asleep as I did when I watched that... You must buy this the effects in it are Fab!!! I enjoyed the Original but this one is better picture and better altogether...
0312330537|5.0|I had been meaning to read this but had put it off, finally, I was visiting an old friend and saw it on her bookshelf, apparently unread.  She urged me to borrow it, I devoured it, and now, I'm going to have to buy my own copy, send it back to her, and beg her to read it for herself.  It's just that kind of book.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that spoils you for other books.  The next several you read will seem weak and boring by comparison.  Nearly impossible to put down once you start it, addictive and all-absorbing, it can break your heart and make you laugh on the same page.  I never wanted to visit India before but now, I wish I could book my trip tomorrow.  Simply amazing-  you won't be disappointed by this masterpiece.
0205313426|5.0|This is the best book on style, or even writing in general, that there is or ever will be on the market. Why? Because it follows its own rules. Strunk, the original author, wrote 22 general rules of usage and composition (or style when put together), and writes all of them with conviction and even a little humor to lighten up something that has always been a stuffy, that being the English language. With the exception of the last chapter, added by E.B. White much later in the lifeline of this book, Strunk's original work was a cool 60 to 70 pages long. Yet it covers everything needed for a writer to get a grasp on his or her own personal style.<br /><br />If you're an aspiring writer, then you should have this book. If you don't, then get it immediately. If ever there was a book that was as important to writing as the pen and paper was, this is definitely the one. This is the original, and every over-sized style book to date has failed miserably at what this \\"little book\\" (as Strunk and White refer to this book as) has achieved. It's easy to reference, it covers everything needed, and it's concise in all its points. And, once again, it follows its own rules, as you shall see when you read this book.
B00005JLFC|5.0|Please please PLEASE release this wonderful film on DVD! One of my very favorites!
B00000C28M|4.0|Love it or hate it, the main reason for the release is for historical reasons.  The performance, and especially Bernstein's pre-performance remarks, caused a huge controversy in the press, and the story has been relayed ever since.   <br />This recoding, and the excellent liner notes, correct a lot of misconceptions:  Gould was in favor of Bernstein's remarks;  Gould's interpretation is no longer considered exceptionally slow by today's standards (meaning the Gould must have had some effect on a few of today's artists).  It is fascinating to hear what all the commotion was about. <br />The most interesting part is that the critics fared the worst in the judgement of time:  the critic from the New York Times absolutely seems ridiculous (in his review that was written in the form of a letter to an imaginary friend!) with his snide remarks that come off as a cranky senior citizen criticizing the youngsters on the stage.  And the fact that so many other newspapers picked up the story as if it was a boxing match. <br />Reagrdless of recording quality (originally meant to be a mono radio broadcast), this is a fascinating performance that documents a very interesting concert in the history of an American conductor and orchesetra, and deserves this wide release.  It shouldn't be the only recording of this Brahms concerto you should have, but it should sit right next to it.
0316172324|4.0|People tend to either believe in the power of intuition  or not, as their own decisionmaking preferences guide them.<br /><br />This book is a collection of instances and examples that will make a lot of sense to some, and leave others muttering 'where is the proof'?<br /><br />For the former: take heart.  you may not always be able to explain what you conclude but if it works, you won't need to.  For the latter: proof is often in consequences and conclusions, not processes.<br /><br />Well worth reading - if only because it challenges the supremacy of logical processes in every day decisionmaking.
B000BKJ78U|3.0|THE STAR WARS movies (the original trilogy) are perhaps some of the greatest movies ever made.  They had great characters, a fantastic story, brilliant acting (at some parts) and were just all around fun.  I grew up, of course, after they came to theaters, but like most people, I had them on VHS.  I was also one of the millions of people who said Star Wars deserved a huge DVD release.  In 2004 I got it, and much to my dismay, it wasn't exactly what I expected.  Some of the changes are not for the better.  On the contrary, the majority of them are worse.  The DVD set released in 2005 is essentially the same, only you don't have bonus features... which is alright, the bonus features were nothing special anyway.  The release in 2004 had four documentaries (the only good one being the A&E Special: Star Wars: Empire of Dreams), an XBOX demo (not a big XBOX fan) Star Episode III Preview (useless now) and commentary.  That was about it (at least the bulk), and after such a long wait I wanted more.  Like say... the holiday special that I, someone who grew up in the 90's NEVER got to see.  Ever (say sorry).  I also wanted the indiviual makings of the movies.  When this DVD relese came around, I was disappointed that none of that stuff was included.<br /><br />Star Wars was full of fun, action, loveable characters (well developed too), story and just about everything that could make a good movie.  The Empire Strikes Back is often cited as the greatest sequel ever made (especially with the line: \\"Luke, I am your father\\").  With how successful and well accepted the films became, why did George Lucas decide to change it?  Especially to connect it with the prequels?<br /><br />The changes aren't just small things either.  They're things that have me pretty upset.  I'm talking more than just \\"Who shot first?  Han or Greedo?\\" (but we all know the scene really is messed up and somehow lessens Hans' character).  What I'm talking about are the even bigger changes such as Hayden Christensen appearing in Return of the Jedi, the CGI which is supposed to be superior, but looks a lot worse.  I'm also tired of Lucas doing things like, replacing real life extras with CGI characters.  This might stem from the fact that then Lucas had virtually nothing to work with, and now he has just about everything to work with.  He's opting for Computers over raw talent.  I'm not against computers, I'm just saying these films were already perfect the way they were, and now that Lucas has come in trying to make them even more perfect, he's destroying them.  A trilogy that once stood above everything, is now being reduced.  Boba Fett's voice is now the same one who did Jengo Fett in the prequels, Anakin's ghost is Hayden Christensen, even the music score has been altered to some extent.  Conversations have been altered with terrible dialogue (most notably is the conversation between Darth Vader and the Emperor in The Empire Strikes Back), things that were already given CGI treatment for the 1997 release were given even more CGI treatment and it looks terrible (most notably, Jabba the Hutt in A New Hope).<br /><br />Overall, I'm disappointed with the DVD release.  And this isn't the last to come.  According to IMDB, Lucas has another release of the trilogy scheduled for release in 2007.  I probably won't pick that one up.<br /><br />The 1997 release was much better than this.  The 1993 release even better.  Movies shouldn't be altered to let them compete with \\"newer\\" movies.  I think people have enough common sense to say to themselves, \\"You can't expect a movie made in 1977 to look like a movie made in 2006.\\"  There's a reason why the color version of Casablanca caused an uproar, and there's a reason why the original Star Wars trilogy being tweaked is causing an uproar.  You're supposed to preserve classics, not ruin them.  I doubt Lucas will ever let people nostalgic for the original have it.  Honestly, he should have two sets out.  One that's completely the originalversions, every single mistake every CGI taken out and everything we loved about the original and one with all these \\"tweaks\\" for those who actually like them (you can always strap that one with a warning sticker or something).  But don't limit our choices to only being able to have a trilogy that's been tarnished.<br /><br />I'll let it slide with a three.  Three stars because they were three great movies.  But some of these changes aren't for the better.  Digitally restored pictures and sound I can deal with, altered sequences I can't.the original versions, every single mistake every CGI taken out and everything we loved about the original and one with all these \\"tweaks\\" for those who actually like them (you can always strap that one with a warning sticker or something).

B0000CEB4V|5.0|George Harrison died on December 1st, 2001. Three days before that, on November 28th, my beloved wife was diagnozed with cervix cancer.  <br />Imagine that, if one of these guys, so rich and powerful, with access to the better clinics in the world, the best doctors, the latest and more expensive medicines and technology, could not beat the deadly cancer... what chances do ordinary people like us have? I read the news of his death and that was the thought that first crossed my mind.  <br />Needless to say, I felt sad to hear it. If there was a world-wide Beatle fan ranking, I guess I would be in the top ten.  <br />I cried when John Lennon was killed as I was driving on my way home and I heard the news on the radio. But George was always my favorite with his spirituality and quietness. <br /> <br />When George died, there where a lot of nice things said about him, like those last words he said about people loving each other. They also talked about his great human qualities and his ever-present desire and will to help people in need. He undoubtely was an extraordinary human being. I shared that with my wife. <br /> <br />As several of the people who have written reviews, I found out that this concert existed a little too late. I had heard about it, but I did'nt know the DVD had come out. I ordered it on January 10th, 2004. This time I was not able to share it with my wife. She passed away a few weeks later, on February of that year, after fighting bravely for more than two years against an unbeatable enemy. George did that to. He passed on peacefully, and so did she. We were married for twenty five wonderful years. <br /> <br />I don't recall how long after that I watched the Concert For George. A few days or maybe weeks later, but it was... inspiring to me. You see... we are all the same after all, and it all comes down to LOVE! That is what this is all about! <br /> <br />I am not going to analize the music, the great musicians and friends of George who organized it, and all of that. It was all just... magnificent! Wonderful! This music and the ones who make it have been and always will be part of our lives. <br />But many other reviewers already said that very well.  <br /> <br />A few days ago I watched this concert again, and I still feel the same way. It is definitely one of the greatest, better, more heart-felt music tributes ever! <br />  <br />I wrote this because I had a story to tell and I felt like sharing it with whoever cares to read it.  <br /> <br />Maybe it is my small personal tribute to both George and my beloved darling wife.
0321344758|4.0|For those of us who do not design Web sites but must distill what makes them effective, this is a great resource. Design and usability expert Steve Krug has pulled together an easy-to-read book that is not only instructive but visually appealing and often amusing. His tenets are basic, but he is smart enough to recognize how everyone has an opinion on Web design and not necessarily a very informed one. Krug's philosophy is that the most effective Web sites come from solid, integrated design that addresses a need tangible to the user. He spends the bulk of the book proving just how valid his philosophy is.<br /><br />The author cites successful examples recognizable to even the most mundane surfer, for example, the tabular navigation structure of Amazon. But he doesn't shy away from those sites he finds lacking like the now-defunct Productopia site, which I agree had a confusing home page. Krug even presents site redesigns given his druthers, and the improvement is quite discernible. Using the helpful analogy of street signs, the author identifies the criticality of using persistent navigation, clear site sections and utilities and a search tool as components of a highly usable site. In order to engage the reader, Krug provides what he calls \\"trunk test\\" sites in which he tests us to identify missing elements and attempts to elicit site improvements. I particularly like this approach since it helps make Krug's guiding principles resonate more clearly.<br /><br />The last part of the book provides a precise overview of usability testing. He provides helpful examples of questions to ask users and even includes a session transcript he conducted himself. Krug strongly believes in not structuring the testing to the point where honest feedback cannot be attained. In fact, he feels that instead of placing the onus on one expensive scientific test that it makes far more sense to conduct many simple affordable tests from beginning to end. I agree with Krug that the value of testing does not come from the collection of quantitative data but rather the qualitative findings that lead toward better design decisions. Krug expresses some similarly strong opinions about home page design and the credibility of so-called subject matter experts. Fortunately, with a decade under his belt at leading Internet companies like Netscape and AOL, he is certainly someone that deserves your attention.come from the collection of quantitative data but rather the qualitative findings that lead toward better design decisions.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Its not about 2 err...cowboys making out.  Its really about relationships.  Families.  Love.  And of course, love lost!  Its everything a movie should be.  If you are afraid to see this movie you really should give it a chance.  Its a well written story that puts you right there at the characters path.  It also shows you how things were right here in America not long ago, with some things still holding strong today.  Hate, prejudice, and fear of acceptance are all a part of it.  Open your mind and watch it.  Then open your heart and understand it.
B000DWMYQ8|3.0|Chicken Little is a funny movie.  It's one of Disney's first computer animated movies(not counting the Pixar films) The music is good.  Chicken Little's friends are funny and enjoyable, especially Runt and Fish. <br />   Chicken Little has things other animated films of today lack. For one thing the movie is about a child.  Another thing it has details seen in classic cartoons.  It also shows what a child feels about his father.  (Unlike Finding Nemo where it's the other way around) <br />   Chicken Little is a great family film.  The father son story is touching.  The townspeople are cute, especially Mayor Turkey Lurkey(Don Knotts last role ever) The sci-fi story was not overwhelming.  The only real disapointment is there isn't enought LOL humor in it.  It's probaly a good enough movie that there will be a ride at one of the Disney Parks based on it.
B0001932ZA|5.0|Basically I'm giving this dvd five stars just on the film alone.  I'm not gonna do much of a Running Man review, coz...it's The Running Man!  The Running Man sells itself.  My gripe is this so called \\"special edition\\".  Honestly, you're better off getting the cheapee Running Man dvd Artisan put out a few years back, coz you'll probably be disappointed with this one.  This is one of those 2 disc editions that only needed one disc for it's features.  Ever notice there's so much of that going around anymore?  \\"2 Disc special Edition\\" used to mean something.  Anyway, disc 1 has the film and a documentary about President Bush, spying and wire taps.  Boy, that sounds like a great featurette for the Running Man dvd, doesn't it?  I mean, who gives a s#%T?  It's a so-so documentary if you caught it on the learning channel or something, but here?  I know it's supposed to be some kind of half-assed attempt to make the Running Man seem like a prophetic film or something, but any kind of \\"spying\\" subplot in the film is rather minor anyway, the focus was more on the media.  Disc 2 has a fullscreen version of the film(again, who gives a s#%T?), onscreen profiles on the Stalkers(big whoop!) and a documentary on reality tv shows.  This documentary attempts a little more of a comparisson to the film than the disc 1 documentary did, but it's still unnecessary.  I hate reality tv and I don't want to watch a bunch of reality tv jagoffs talking about how reality shows are made.  I don't know about you folks, but when I buy a Special Edition of The Running Man, I want bonus features pertaining to The Running Man.  Where's the retrospective documentary?  Where's the interviews with Subzero and Buzzsaw and  Fireball?  A complete and total waste.  But the Running Man still kicks!!
B000E6GBV2|5.0|I have been listening to alternative/ underground music since 1973, with the releasing of the New York Dolls in 1973.  Recently I have been getting music introductions from KEXP in Seattle- awesome radio station, great dj's, tons of quality new music, and this is where I was introduced to Band of Horses.  Wow....what a great cd. <br /> <br />There isn't a medium song on `Everything All The Time'- excellent song writing, great melodies, and inspiring lyrics.  As said by others, the vocal sound is somewhat reminiscent of My Morning Jacket, but BOH is much different and very compelling.  Excellent debut cd, especially like `The Funeral' and `The Great Salt Lake'.  Excellent stuff.  If you like the music off the beaten path, buy it, you will not be disappointed. <br />
B00000AF98|5.0|just got lost in the Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Poison craze for power ballads & pretty-looking men. Kiss was in the midst of it, but they blended 80's power pop-metal with some nifty 70's retro lyrics & hooks. They've gone from wanting to sex females right away (or not) to hanging out with them for a while, i.e.; I'll Fight Hell.. & Turn on the Night...  <br />
B000E33VWW|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  It was not as I expected.  I did not read the reviews prior to going to see the movie and was pleasantly surprised.  The story underlying \\"In Cold\\" was...all I can say is that I would highly recommended it.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|So, the story goes like this: young, beautiful woman enters her local Tower Records on a sunny afternoon in search of new musical delights. She goes to the jazz section to browse. No pretense, no expectations, just one of those leisurely gestures of listening to music...when lo and behold, she picks up a cd cover where a handsome and dapper white guy a la Frank Sinatra meets Matt Dillon has his hands in his pockets and is staring intently into space. So she picks up the pair of headsets and presses \\"play.\\"<br /><br />Okay, so I'll speak in first-person now... When the horn intro of  \\"Feeling Good\\" came on, I shuddered. Then Buble's velvety voice  entered and I was just literally blown away. I still crown Nina Simone the best vocalist for \\"Feelin' Good,\\" but Buble comes mighty close.<br /><br />The rest of the album is equally as astonishing. He just has a great voice that begs to be listened to. For me, the highlights of the album are \\"You Don't Know Me,\\" \\"The More I See You,\\" and \\"Home.\\" \\"A Song for You,\\" and \\"How Sweet It Is,\\" were a bit dull to me. I wasn't fond of the arrangement or his vocal style for this song genre. Sorry, but no one can really mimic Donny Hathaway or Marvin Gaye.  Overall, the album has a refreshing up beat/big band flavor to it. He reminds me of this vocalist that once sang with Cassandra Wilson. The name escapes me but I remember listening to a duet she did with him years ago... Anyway, enjoy!
B0002SROT0|5.0|It's always a shame when an artist dies before completing work on a new album, especially if it's years in the making. There's always a sense of unfinished business, as cliched as it is, and imperfections that either flaw the album as a mess of embryonic ideas, or make the album a classic, out of grief of an artist's passing. There are a few posthumous releases that are just excellent, though. Elliott Smith's, from a basement on a hill, falls into that category. <br /> <br />With Elliott Smith, who took his own life in October 2003, the stigma of an unfinished product follows his ghost, especially with others completing his songs after he died. In fact, it has been reported that he only actually completed a small amount of songs at the time of his suicide. However, I feel a sense of completion with from a basement on a hill, released a mere 2 days before the first anniversary of Smith's untimely death. The songs play like an extended suicide note, with Elliott Smith longing to \\"find some beautiful place to get lost,\\" \\"staying down where no one else can give me grief,\\" and meeting \\"the only maker you'd wanna meet.\\" Some of the titles are ominous as well, and they express his struggle with addiction and depression. The last line in the first verse of \\"King's Crossing\\" state that \\"I can't prepare for death more than I already have.\\" <br /> <br />I guess Smith's self-inflicted stab wound was inevitable, as FtBH lays out clearer than Jimi Hendrix when he recorded \\"Angel\\" one month before his 1970 death. The consolation for Smith's dark farewell verses is that his penchant for Beatlesque pop, and ornate acoustic fingerpicking makie the music intensely beautiful, as well as his use of heavier, fuzzier arrangements on \\"Coast to Coast\\" among tohers (or was that posthumous touch-ups by Jon Brion?). The music is a hard paradox to pin down. Take George Harrison's Brainwashed, and Nirvana's In Utero & Joy Division's Closer. Brainwashed was a ce;ebration of life and accepting that the end was near, thanks to an inoperable form of brain cancer, wheereas Closer & In Utero were preludes to the suicides of Ian Curtis and Kurt Cobain. Elliott Smith didn't have the abrasive spirit of Cobain or the obvious dysphoria that plagued Curtis, or Harrison's optimism and strong belief in transcendence. Smith did pick up Harrison's subtlety (after all, the Beatles were Smith's reported favorite band) in the fact that his life would soon end, but he also had the dark side of Kurt Cobain & Ian Curtis to end his life himself. <br /> <br />I won't deny that suicide is an act of cowardice, or a last resort if circumstances seem to be way too overbearing, and there can always be a way around it. Yet Smith's lyrics reveal anguish that after listening to this album (extremely difficult to listen to all the way through with 15 songs at about 57 minutes), you can be hopeful that he is in a better place, away from his private hell. Nonetheless, his tremendous gift of writing beautiful, mostly acoustic, songs is sorely missed in the music world.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|I was just a kid when Maverick was on television but I still remember how it was a must see for my parents. Despite a couple of reviews saying that this was just three episodes I bought it and saying that it was the most rewarding purchase I've ever made here is an understatement. Go back to the good old days when shows could be clever, when good writing kept an audience rivited with humor or mystery or romance and they didn't need graphic displays of sex or violence to do it. These three episodes of Maverick were so funny I could not stop laughing even after rewatching them several times.  They are intellegent, imaginative, timelessly fresh, \\"Pappy's\\" sayings are always apropos and yet even a child can get a kick out of the stories. I recommend these and hope that Warner comes out with the full run of the shows because I will certainly buy them.
B000EGCITG|4.0|First off, this album is pretty amazing!  Musically it is diverse and with each genre Pink tackles she shows that she is a true musician that excels.  Her voice is incredible, the sound quality is first-rate. The musicality, recording and production are just unbelieveable. <br /> <br />Pink tackles many issues of the day and leaves few stones unturned.  For those reviewers who write that Pink is of two-minds on this album, learn how to listen and interpret music...Pink uses musical satire to get her message through.  For example,  I have read a number of reviews that stated her song \\"Cuz I Can\\" is Pink boasting about her wealth...give me a break!  When was the last time you saw Pink in the tabloids rubbing her wealth in anyone's face!?  She is mocking how stars in entertainment live with their riches on their sleeves.   <br /> <br />This album is a heartfelt effort by a very talented artist and how she approaches each subject may seem bold or harsh to many but she is creative and clear with what she is communicating.  At first her writing antics may seem juvenile but don't let the \\"attitude\\" fool you, she is quite witty...which is where I believe her album breaks down... <br /> <br />Why, oh why, did she have to drop the f-bomb on her album and recieve the explicit lyrics rating?  Her intellectual tackling of pop-culture becomes marred by her own inability to produce an album that doesn't need to \\"f\\" this and \\"f\\" that.  Because of that, I am very very dissappointed. <br /> <br />Musically - stunning <br />Subject-wise - bold, courageous and witty <br />lyrics - everything is great until the f-word is used as an adjective numerous times.... <br /> <br />The album was almost perfect...almost.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I thought this was an excellent film - but then I read reviews from people who hated it and have to warn those of you reading this that it may not be for everyone.  People with short attention spans who need fast-paced action to be stimulated will probably be disappointed with this flick.  Fans of independent films, who like something different and original, however, should love this one.<br /><br />Napoleon (John Heder) is a high school loser. Napoleon's brother spends most his hours looking for dates on the internet and his uncle, who is temporarily \\"babysitting\\" them, is mentally stuck in the year 1982, when he was a high school (or was it college) football star.<br /><br />Napoleon befriends a new student from Mexico, Pedro, and helps him campaign for student body president.  All the while he tries to build up the courage to ask one of his female classmates to the prom.<br /><br />That is the gist of the plot and it might not sound too exiting, but it is very entertaining and is all done with great acting and lots of humour.  I loved it!
B000001EXR|5.0|Kiss made their name in the early to mid 70's with their very creative live shows and fun, dare I say poppy, hard rock of the day.  They continued putting out rock on the harder side but with a polished sound which made their music sound less hard rock than it could have.  Their sound didn't change too much except for a song here and there (ex: Tears Are Falling with a disco sound).<br /><br />In the mid-90's and their career moving along (as in not doing great but not doing bad) they decided to switch up the sound and try an album influenced by grunge which was very popular at the time.  What resulted was 'Carinval of Souls' and their best ever.  When you listen to Carnival of Souls you hear straight ahead in your face rock and roll like they'd never put out before and sadly will probably never put out again.<br /><br />This album gets totally lost as they'd hardly released the album when they announced a reunion tour followed by retirement tours etc...To my knowledge they never toured on this album and I woudln't be surprised if they never played any of these songs live either since Ace Frehley and Peter Criss had nothing to do with them.<br /><br />This is a great album and deserved to be promoted by touring and in my opinion, Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer deserved to make cash off it as well.  It's also my opinion that Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley really owed it to Bruce Kulick, Eric Singer, the fans and the music of this album to promote it but the past is in the past.  Luckily the music is still with us...
B000E97Y6K|2.0|If you like special effects, you'll love this movie. If you like good acting and intelligent script, don't waste your time.<br /><br />There is very little to like about this movie other than the CGI effects. Watch either of the other two King Kong movies instead.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|::WARNING::<br />  this review will probably end up very lengthy<br /><br />  PART 1 : BUYING THE CD:<br />it's 2006 nearly the end of March,I was walking around listening to the LCD Soundsystem on my way to Rasputins(a music store) after going to Target and finding out they no longer carry Frances the Mute.Half way there my batteries die to my CD player.<br /><br />  I get to the store it looks like they have no copies used or new of Frances the Mute.<br />  After looking around a little I almost give up hope, but then I remember sometimes they stock cds underneath the Displays. There at a gleaming sale price of 7.99 was Frances the Mute.<br />  I am not really sure if I will like the band not ever sure what kind of music they are, but something told me that I needed to have this album.<br /><br />  PART 2: The Process begins :<br /><br />So after buying the cd and a 2 pack of cheap batteries after being hounded by some rap artists trying to sell there cd to me, I open the case and pop the gleaming red disc in my player.<br />  The first part of Cygnus playing ok it's sounding good.Then out of nowhere bang an onslaught of Guitar meyhem.<br />  Cedric and his amazing vocals,Omar and his astounding Guitar Playing. I am hooked. For the past week and a half to two weeks this is all I listen to. Oh My God this cd is nothing short of amazing.

Sparta hails in comparison to At the Drive in and most certainly The Mars Volta.<br />  Sure the music styles are completly different, but that doesn't have anything to do with the amount of talen they have, so in my opinion, Afros all the way baby.<br /><br />  This concludes my longwinded review of Frances the Mute which I guess isn't much of a review as just praising the band. BTW L'Via L' Viaquez is quite possibly the greatest rock epid ever laid down to a recording.<br /><br /> ~laterz Electroite and my taste are varried.

B000E6UWE4|5.0|Being a fan of good, intelligent fantasy means you have to sift through many authors and books before finding one you like and can get wrapped up in (i.e. George R.R. Martin).  The Malazan books are excellent for Martin fans as it brings in unique characters that play the hero role but have their own faults, gods are not allpowerful and can fall, and complex plots that are original. It is hard to call anyone in the books actual heroes, they are ordinary characters set in extraordinary circumstances.  If you are in the military you will appreciate the battles and references, however anyone can follow it.  The battles are complex but not so much that they become hard to follow.  It scratches the hard to reach spot where fantasy is the backdrop to a GOOD story.  Without the fantasy the story would still be good.  All in all it is a great read.
B000002L9W|5.0|This is a fun solo album that has a lot of what post 1984 Van Halen might have sounded like if Roth would not have been kicked out.  Eddie's guitar is replaced with Steve Vai's guitar and it all works out well.  Roth gets a little more creative freedom and we get a great bunch of songs.<br /><br />So, do we miss Eddie and the gang?  Of course.  You can never replace the formula that was the original VH.  But this cd is better than the first Van Halen cd with Sammy.
0812550706|4.0|I spent a long time thinking that this book was really bad, but I couldn't tell you why. Honestly, I can't even remember where I got the impression. <br /> <br />It is a good thing that I read this after I was a teenager, though, lest I fall too far into believing that Ender is me, as Orson Scott Card suggests many kids do.  <br /> <br />Other reviewers have probably said enough about what the book is about and why you should read it. As such, I will keep this brief.  <br /> <br />Orson Scott Card, much like Robert Aspirin, writes an excellent tale that makes us consider one key question: What is acceptable behavior when the very survival of your society is at stake? The draft? Worse? Enslavement? Genocide? What?  <br /> <br />Both of these raise this question, and they answer it with VERY different answers. The truth is that if you've read one and enjoy it, you should read the other. You will enjoy it, too.  <br /> <br />Definitely worth picking up. I read it in a day, so it is not too long. Buy it, read it, and pass it along. Not so deep as to need more than a week of thought, but not so simple as to make you want to throw it across the room for being worthless. A keeper. <br /> <br />HarkiusAbsurden und wie man sich als Mensch sinnvoll damit auseinandersetzt bzw. arrangiert. Ebenso der Glossar, der alle in diesem Buch ge- bzw. missbrauchten (*scherz*) Philosophen mit kurzer Beschreibung und ihren Hauptwerken aufführt. Salomon verläßt - dankenswerterweise - bei der Auswahl seiner Philosophen gelegentlich die breitgetretenen Hauptstraßen und bringt auch mal etwas weniger bekannte Persönlichkeiten (wie z.B. Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, dessen Buch &quot;Ich bin&quot; ich sehr empfehlen kann) in die Handlung ein.<br />Für die gute Unterhaltung und die wirklich unkonventionelle Handlung gibt es von mir vier Sterne ****.
B000002UEB|5.0|Not a long review here.  This CD speaks for itself.  It's simply one of the most perfect works ever released by any band.  It comes across even better when you see them play it live.  Anyone who disagrees is simply retarded.  Go listen to St Anger or something.
0425180638|1.0|The book starts off where Black Notice left off.  Although I have read Black Notice, that was a few months ago, so I found the book confusing and lacking in necessary detail.  And I think that writing the book in first person present was a huge mistake.  While we see through the characters eyes, the view is bland and colorless.  I did not feel that there was any connection with the character, but that she was trying a writing exercise in communicating what you physically see.
B00003CWPL|2.0|I am a moderate fan of David Lynch.  Some of his movies I absolutely love (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, the Twin Peaks series) while there are others that I see as being absolutely pointless (Blue Velvet, and this film).  Eraserhead is an exercise in style, and nothing else.  If you just look at it from that angle, it is a very stylistic, cool, creepy movie.  However, looking at the film from the viewpoint of a normal movie fan, you will get absolutely nothing out of this movie.  It basically has no plot, and the film is tough to follow because of the complete lack of dialog.  Conversations are sparse in this movie, and when people do talk there is nothing to give the viewer any more clue as to what is going on.<br /><br />The main character of the film, Henry, is a paranoid, nerdy man who lives alone in a one-room apartment.  Henry has apparently been in a relationship with a girl, and when he goes to her parents' house for dinner, he finds out that she was pregnant and gave birth to some sort of creature (definitely not a human child).  So they get married (I assume) and move into Henry's apartment together, while keeping the newborn creature on top of a dresser.  The rest of the film is basically about how the creature drives both of them crazy, and, as most David Lynch films do, the movie ends without really revealing anything of what it all means.<br /><br />I like some of David Lynch's stuff because while it might be impossible to \\"get,\\" he at least makes good movies that are interesting.  This film wasn't even interesting, and it had no semblance of meaning or purpose.  Mostly it was just a creepy, unnerving film about horrible things happening to weird people.  I see how this film made David Lynch famous, but I think he has made much better films since this.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|...and some thoughts on why the 1976 version was in some ways better.<br /><br />This new KING KONG is worth a look but I find it not as overwhelmingly great as to justify all the fawning reviews it has received.<br /><br />The first hour DESPERATELY needs trimming.<br /><br />The interaction between the ape and the girl is very very good. The ape is very expressive. Great animation.<br /><br />Some of the actions setpieces are ridiculously overblown (and run too long). I have no problem with humans running from stampeding brontosauruses and Rexes but they survive far too many close calls and calamities for there to be any real sense of danger anymore. A few close calls would have been fun and exciting, but for there to be close call after close call after close call after close call.....it gets silly real quick. And the suspense and sense of danger is diluted to almost nothing.<br /><br />King Kong runs with the girl in his grasp, drops her and recatches her time and time again. Unless she were made of steel or rubber she would have been squashed like a pea long before it was all over. Didn't even break a rib. What the hell is she made from?<br /><br />Things like that, the elements that s-t-r-e-t-ch-h credibility within the confines of a fantasy film, are the kinds of things that cheapen these movies and make them look like expensive video games.<br /><br />I never got a sense that there was much real love between Ann Darrow and the male lead (Adrian Brody's character). Attraction, sure. But love, no. So when Brody's character goes through hell and high water to rescue her it seems more an act of chivalry than love.<br /><br />Shall I go on? Why not.<br /><br />The bi-planes attacking Kong on the top of the Empire State Building -- that part was pretty cool and well-shot (especially in terms of camera POV and set up, all within the computer, I know). I am deathly afraid of heights and those scenes gave my vertigo a real workout.<br /><br />Ann Darrow/Naomi Watts atop the ESB: In the dead of winter and at that height, she would have been blown off the top of the building by the chilling and powerful winds. Looked like Spring up there in the movie. And though the sunrise looked nice for the scene, the elapsed time of the whole third-act NYC sequence leads us to believe that the great unveiling show at the Times Square theatre must have taken place at about 4 o'clock in the morning.<br /><br />New York scenes: -- other than the crowd in the theatre district, the town looked deserted. Hardly a soul in sight.<br /><br />Skull Island: The first native we see is a little girl. In typical Hollywood fashion, she looks like a very cute young actress wearing \\"make me look grimy\\" makeup. The Old Lady native is obviously a woman in heavy amounts of \\"make me look old\\" makeup. That stuff almost always looks fake and calls attention to itself. Couldn't they just find a good senior-age actress?<br /><br />Note how the Skull Island natives just disappear from the movie after they attempt to sacrifice Naomi Watts. Our heroes return to the Natives' area later to trap Kong (no mention of how they got Kong back to NYC on that little boat) but the natives are nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />Notice that in the long and protracted fight with the T-Rexes (or V-Rexes or whatever) Kong sustains several strong bites to his forearms but still muddles through as if nothing happened. But our heroes shoot a relatively tiny harpoon into his leg and Kong is pretty much disabled. Watch Kong almost fall down when he takes that harpoon to the leg. It shouldn't have felt like much more than a needle stick to him. Sure, they used some chloroform on him too but it was a negligible amount meant for incapaciting animals about a tenth of Kong's size.<br /><br />The fact that the Skull Island wildlife is at such odds with each other while our heroes are on the island invalidates the possiblitiy that those species' populations could have co-existed for so many thousandsor millions of years together.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but there is no way in hell ANYONE could have survived that \\"bug attack\\" sequence, machine guns or no. It all looked like a video game. Did you see how many close-range machine gun hits the bug on Adrien Brody took from a nervous gunner and Brody never got a scratch?<br /><br />I have other beefs too, but suffice it to say that a lot of this movie was overblown video-gaming and I find it VERY hard to believe that so many Film Critics would grade this film so highly and uncritically. This film gets compared to \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" a lot, but \\"King Kong (2005)\\" is succeeding on spiffy visual effects and the patronage of a quality-starved moviegoing public. \\"Raiders\\" succeeded because it had real fun, real suspense, and a central hero who was in real jeopardy but climbed believably out of it. You never really sense our heroes are in any real jeopardy because the danger sequences are too ridiculously elaborate and overstuffed to be believable or credible (again, within the confines of this obvious fantasy world).<br /><br />This KING KONG suffers from what I call \\"George Lucas Sequelitis\\" -- the story is nothing but a vehicle for the effects sequences. Given a choice to make between any particular moment's or scene's narrative integrity or to beef up that same moment's or scene's spiffy and elaborate effects, Jackson (like Lucas) chose the latter.<br /><br />This film rates a 3 1/2 stars out of 5 at best. It is a fun movie, but the parts that don't work so well and are transparently thin will not hold up well to repeat viewings, and thus the film's value will not have the same kind of \\"legs\\".<br /><br />I was 10 years old when Dino DeLaurentis' 1976 version hit the screens and I actually liked that movie a lot, even if I though the Great Ape looked like a human in a suit (which it was) more than an actual ape. But it DID have two very important things going for it: the first was Quality Actors. Watts and Brody are good actors, but they are given rather thin dialogue and we really don't get much characterization beyond the two-dimensional sort. Watts gets a few moments late in the film, but mostly it is \\"damsel in distress\\" stuff. 1976's Jeff Bridges, Charles Grodin, and Jessica Lange managed to rise above the so-so script and lend some gravitas to their characters.<br /><br />The second thing the 1976 version had that this version flirted with but never nailed was a character like Jeff Bridges' character. He was a scientist who knew that this undertaking was foolish and was the voice of reason and perspective. \\"We took away their God. A year from now that place will just be an island full of drunks\\", his character said when they had Kong safely aboard the oil tanker headed back to NYC. That is a very important part of that story's mythology and it didn't get addressed properly in this new version. You felt that Bridges' character was the lone source of intelligence in the whole proceedings. In this new version NO ONE fits that bill.<br /><br />\\"King Kong\\" (2005) will make a ton of money, sell a ton of DVDs and video games, and probably win a few technical Oscars. But it is also an overblown and overstretched piece of indulgent filmmaking that is riding a wave of hype and Peter Jackson's post-Rings Trilogy reputation. If you look at the film even somewhat critically (as apparently our nation's trusted movie critics have largely failed to do) you will see that its flaws are large and in great number. In fact, I would venture that the filmmakers were \\"too close\\" to the project and lost their narrative objectivity because they were having too much fun with the concept.

B000EHQ8AU|5.0|<br />Some have said this is an album for people who love Placebo, as if it was written for the fans. If there is one band that has proven time and time again through their craft that they are not in the business of pleasing their fans, it is Placebo. <br /> <br />Most Placebo fans would prefer it if Brian was still running around in a dress and about to get a sex change. Most Placebo fans would love it if Placebo played 'Nancy Boy' at all of their concerts. But neither of those is the case any longer. <br /> <br />No. This is 2006. And one can't help talking about MEDS without also talking about how Placebo have changed over the past 10 years. <br /> <br />Brian is father now (hence the line \\"Out of the womb and into the void\\" from 'One Of A Kind'). Gone is the bitchy and antagonistic tone in interviews. There are no more stories about Placebo \\"leaving a trail of blood and spunk\\" across the globe. <br /> <br />You can't say MEDS is a return to Placebo's roots, because that's what the buzz has been for every album since WITHOUT YOU I'M NOTHING. <br /> <br />What you can say, is that MEDS is a damn fine record, and one that Placebo has every right to be proud of. <br /> <br />It was written fast. It was recorded fast. <br /> <br />Every song has a sense of urgency about it, a sense of being all about the moment. <br /> <br />The opening and title track 'Meds' begins with solo guitar and just Mr Molko's voice, like a bird of prey circling silently far off in the distance, getting closer, getting louder, getting faster, and then it proceeds to swoop down on you like a predator, and by the end you just can't help but be tapping your foot and screaming \\"Baby, did you forget to take your meds?\\" The vocals of VV from The Kills add a nice touch to this track. It's good that her and Brian didn't sing over each other like Placebo has done with other duets in the past. <br /> <br />'Infra-Red' is somewhat of a distillation of all the ill-feeling left by past relationships that Placebo has always sung about. \\"Someone call an ambulance, there's gonna be an accident...Forget your running, I will find you...\\" That pretty much says it all. <br /> <br />'Drag' is about everything you feel when you're in love with someone and can't help but feel you're a mere insect, a stain on the bottom of their boot, an entirely unworthy speck of dust just lucky enough to even be in your lover's presence. <br /> <br />'Space Monkey' takes you on a trip out of this world. <br /> <br />'Post Blue'...well...I honestly don't know what this one is about. It's just fun to listen to. <br /> <br />'Because I Want You', the first UK single off MEDS, is a pretty damn good piece of pop rock catchiness. The lyrics don't really mean much, but then they're not supposed to. This song is all about grabbing your attention. Mr Hewitt's drumming on this track, however, is pretty fantastic. <br /> <br />'Blind' is, I must confess, my favorite song on the album. Yes, I know Placebo have said it's \\"a track for girls\\", but I don't care. Brian's vocals are absolutely stunning on this track, and they really remind me of the highs he can, and does reach during a live performance. Not to mention, the lyrics are simply extraordinary. \\"Don't go and leave me, and please don't drive me blind, You don't believe me, But you do this every time...If I could tear you from the ceiling, I'd freeze us both in time, And find a brand new way of seeing, your eyes forever glued to mine...\\" <br /> <br />'Pierrot The Clown' has a sadness about it that just can't be explained. Imagine being horribly abused by a lover and still laying around on the bed silently thinking to yourself, \\"And if you're ever around, in the city or the suburbs, of this town...Be sure to come around, I'll be wallowing in sorrow, Wearing a frown...\\" Not to mention some of the best lines, in my opinion, that Placebo has ever put to paper: \\"When I dream, I dream your lips...When I dream, I dream your kiss...When I dream, I dream your fists...your fists...your fists...\\" <br /> <br />'Broken Promise'...eh. Placebo really didn't use Michael Stipe's vocals to their \\"full potential\\" shall we say. <br /> <br />'One Of A Kind' is one for all the people out there who sat in the back of the class as a student, or who still do. \\"I'm on a race and I'm doing fine, thank you.\\" Ever felt like that? Then you'll love this. <br /> <br />'In The Cold Light Of Morning' is a track I can only recommend closing your eyes and listening to in a dark quiet room, either with headphones or with the sound pumped way up. It's perhaps the most dreamy and hypnotic of all the songs on this album and it really takes you on a mental journey. The visuals, of stumbling home early in the morning, when the rest of the world is just starting their day and you're ending yours, and hating yourself for it--these visuals are strong enough. But more than what images this track conjures, the piano and drumming and vocals just come together in a perfect anesthetic mix. <br /> <br />'Song To Say Goodbye' shows more of that classic Placebo style by putting a song with the word \\"Goodbye\\" in the title at the end of an album (much like literally putting a young man romantically entangled with a ghost on the cover of an album titled SLEEPING WITH GHOSTS). That being said, this song is also a single, and it's far better than 'Because I Want You' because at least the lyrics go to darker and more original territory. <br /> <br />So there we have it. <br /> <br />Placebo's latest magnum opus. <br /> <br />Is it \\"their best work yet\\"? <br /> <br />Hell if I know. That's for you to decide. <br /> <br />PS, the bonus DVD is actually quite good. Aside from the \\"documentary\\" being way too short, it's quite a nice addition. <br /> <br />Good things about the DVD: <br /> <br />* If you're technically handy, you can extract complete instrumental versions of every track on MEDS via the 'Lyrics' section of DVD <br /> <br />* The included demo songs are actually better than the finished album tracks, if you ask me, and that's only because they really come alive and have a \\"raw\\" quality about them that the polished album tracks lack <br /> <br />* HOORAY! We finally get a crystal clear version of one of the best Placebo songs to never make it onto an official release until now, 'Long Division'
0316666343|4.0|This book I thought was very good and well wrighten. When I was told that I had to read it in my school I didn't like it because I don't like to read . But I finished this book and for not being a reader I was an incretable book.If I had to I would read it again. Susie is a very good charactor the reason why I gave it a 4 is because I realy didnt like the end of the book but other then that it was good. <br />
B000002UV9|5.0|After the masterpiece that was Operation Mindcrime, I wasn't expecting much on the next release.  I was sorely proven wrong.  This is yet another QR CD you can listen to front to back.  No filler here.  A fine demonstration of musicianship.  Unfortunatly, everything put out after this CD was utter crap.  Their saving grace came a few days ago with the release of Mindcrime 2.  It seems the rut is over!
0312323867|5.0|I really enjoyed the characters. I found myself hoping/waiting for Darcy and Ethan to get together. Sure, I don't know if Darcy's personality transformation was entirly beleivable, but that didn't take away from my interest in the book or characters. I've had a hard time lately finding a good read that is hard to put down, but this fit the bill- I couldn't stop reading. I liked Something Borrowed just as well, and can't wait for her next book.
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is beautiful in every sense of the word. The Mellon Collie album was more than an album to me; it helped me through many rough times growing up. Almost every emotion you could think of is on this album, from angry and agressive songs to soft poetic pieces reaching out and touching your soul. I recommend Thirty-Three, In the Arms of Sleep, Beautiful and We Only Come Out at Night to name a few (all from disk 2). These are as I said just a few (I could list many more!). Whatever your thing is whether it be downloading the album on Limewire Light or going through iTunes or even CDNOW this is a album everyone should own. Truly a classic.
B000EGF0B4|4.0|Historically the Golden Globe Awards have always tended to behave one step ahead in what moral codes or conventional scruples concern respect the Academy Awards. The film deals with a very special relationship widely commented around the world between two men.<br /><br />This delicate issue is handled with special care, without hurting sensibilities, the script nevertheless is built on non solid basis, making just emphasis on the surface of the things. I missed for instance the necessary dramatic density or nourishing flashbacks. There is an excessive employment of arresting visual landscapes and some well made violent dialogues. But the epilogue is so artificial in what dramatic expression that really disappoints as final corollary or deserved tribute. It's like you open the door but not entirely, leaving to see imperfectly certain diffuse and distorted images in a mirror.<br /><br />Just imagine what about this film in hands of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, but if I had to pronounce for an actual filmmaker, I would have suggested three names without special preference: Nagisa Oshima, Pedro Almodovar or Peter Greenaway.<br /><br />Special  acknowledgement to the arresting photography, artistic direction and splendid performances of the two main protagonists.
B00003W8NM|2.0|10. Your idea of \\"movin' uptown\\" is living in a refrigerator box under the G.W.   9. You envy the comparatively toothy smiles of Tennessee still operators.  8. You tried to get a life once, but it was already checked out.  7. Your ability to suspend disbelief is powerful enough to believe Brad Pitt actually taking a bath.  6. You've heard of Jack Kerouac, but can't remember whether he drove for Richard Petty or Junior Johnson.   5. You join an clandestine army without a cause or a clue, mostly 'cause you get to say \\"yes, sir!\\" all the time.  4. You're not into girls all that much, but your imaginary friend is.   3. Your taste in shirt colors decidedly runs toward brown.    2. People keep making the odd comment that your fists resemble boomerangs.  1. As Barf said in Spaceballs, \\"I'm my own best friend.\\"      I'll have to admit that Fight Club deserves credit for generating so much discussion. If you're looking for that perfect slacker-fascist flick to unwind after a long night putsching the Beer Hall, this is the movie for you! If you think anarchy, nihilism, and cliches about consumerism and corporate America are philosophically deep, you'll trade in your dog-earred copy of Catcher in the Rye for Fight Club. But I agree with the person who said the giddy reviews are a lot scarier than the movie itself--which is just manipulative and self-indulgent.

B00005QFE5|5.0|This dvd is excellent.  The subtitles take nothing from the beautiful cinematogrophy.  The subtle nuances leave the viewers imagination the pleasure of wondering what this beautiful woman is thinking and feeling as she yearns for her true love.  Zhang is brilliant and genuine.  This was a joy to watch and a fond memory to hold.  A pleasure.
B00005JO20|5.0|Let me begin by telling you my dislike for Peter Jackson coming into Kong. After LOTR (a better book, excellent films though as well) the fans and media turned me off on the series to a large degree. So I went into Kong with my girlfriend with almost a gruge against Peter Jackson, I wanted him to fail. Anyone living before this movie would know the press built Peter Jackson up to be untouchable, a god. Anyways, to what we are all here for the film review. With all this in mind I came out upset at myself, for I like so many others had become enchanted with the \\"magic\\" Jackson is capable of creating. The movie which has been re created more times than I care to think about brings life to this old story. I left the theater enchanted and still have those sentiments months later. I remember seeing the previews and thinking \\"how stupid\\" another King Kong, bravo Mr. Jackson very original. Well, I was wrong. King Kong really didn't even intrest me (i went because of my g/f) I always thought the idea of a huge gorilla parading around Manhattan was silly and downright ridiculous. However, when I left the theater I had all those emotions one gets who likes this film (happy, scared, sad, hate) and to this day, months later, I still hold the same sentiments. Do yourself a favor and at least rent this movie.
0553801503|1.0|Shame about Martin, when he started the series it had such promise. This book was, as he admits on his website, only half of a book and to add insult to injury he wants his fans to stop bugging him because he will finish the other half when he gets round to it. Since his last update on his own site was January 2008 when he said that he had no idea when the next volume, which will bring the series about half way would be finished, I would not hold my breath. Personally I shall be boycotting his books in future.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|Once agian David takes 2 cups of water and adds it to water agian whips in air to produce more of the same predictable nothing that he has made his trademark during his post Roger music career. Makes me value Roger more and more. <br /> <br />Those folks who missed Pink Floyd during the years they were a bright creative light will scurry to obtain this mass of Fraud-floyd-kinda sounds like it don't it?.  <br /> <br />The only redeming factor that raises it above the terrible junk he produced before is that thankfully he didn't try to palm this one off as \\"another Pink Floyd album\\". For that alone I gave him ONE STAR! <br /> <br />
B000BEZQ18|1.0|It is my opinion that the oscars were rigged. No one who listens to the instrumentals on this soundtrack along with the glorious music of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" can make any comparison, unless they have no musical background. It's like comparing the wailing of a hound dog to the strains of a Rachmaninoff masterpiece.  <br />   Your money could be much better spent, unless you want to be lulled to sleep by monotonous music without a singable melody.
B00005JO20|2.0|Anyone that hasn't seen the original will love this movie with it's endless action and special effects. However, the true Kong fan will be very disappointed if he expects to see the original movie redone with state-of-the-art special effects. The movie is an hour too long, with everything over done. The acting is so-so. Naomi Watts is ok as Ann Darrow, but she surely isn't up to Fay Wray's performance in the original. Jack Black fails in his attempt to equal the role of Carl Denham, masterfully played by Robert Armstrong in the 1933 release. Credibility is lacking in many ways. The antique cars are painted bright colors, something that never happened in 1933. Dress and language are totally \\"today\\" with words like \\"stiffed\\", an expression invented in the 70's, sticking out like a sore thumb. I could go on and on, but you get the picture. This movie could be improved by editing out over an hour of superfluous material. Enjoy it as an action packed adventure, but don't expect to see an improved King Kong. It falls flat on it's face in it's attempt to do just that.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This is the best (film) love story since Out of Africa. Seemingly slow at first, the film is gently and lovingly wrapping itself around your heart. Heath Ledger gives a perfomance that is so acutely aligned with the story, he opens up the real world of the sorrow that must be lived by two people who cannot be theirselves because of the restraints of our historical society. His posture, his tightness, the barely audible cry of his voice are the stuff of Brando, Dean, and Penn. That he never pushes anything on us is the miracle of allowing us to see - full heartedly - the real life of this sweet, decent, unfulfilled man. And, miraculously, we never get a sense that we could judge him harshly. Ledger brings us into Ennis' soul. (One particular moment of astonishingly good acting is when - without ever letting Ennis' shoulders come down, or his body to let free, Mr. Ledger laughs so sweetly; holding on to the forced into a corner body of Ennis, while showing us - heartbreakingly - the joy that lay so deeply beaten into this man. It is some of the best acting you will ever see). Jake Gillenhaal is the perfect gem of a character that, in other circumstances, would have made the perfect love partner for Ledger's Ennis. All heart and love just emminates from him when - especially in the beginning of the film - as we get to watch just how much he desirews real connection with Ennis. Michelle Williams - in what could have been a thankless role - gives a deeply felt truth to the events she witnesses that must have torn her inner self assunder. From her first discovery of their shared passion to her final disclosure to her husband, she makes real the genuine loss that she has lived with. (I was completely flumoxed as to why Crash won best picture; other than that it touches on a more real part of life in Los Angeles today. As a film, I found it lacking - more like a TV movie than a work of art. As we watched Crash, I kept saying before each scene; \\"oh, now he'll pick up the wrong truck... Oh, now he'll treat the black people badly\\"; and, so obviously, \\"now they'll show us what a nice guy he is\\"... (when dealing with his father). The movie was just always so obvious in what was coming next). With Brokeback Mountain, I found myself haunted by the sorrow of the life they had to lead for days after seeeing the film. That has not happened to me while watching a movie in decades. This is a must for all who believe that art is a reflection  of life; as it was for Ennis and Jack. This film beautifully, sweetly, and emotionally holds the mirror right up to nature (as it were). This is a movie for all people to see and feel. It is a genuine - heart on it's sleeve - romance; and we are due for that.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|This is one movie that I had looked forward to for a long time. Words were spread out that this was the most disturbing movie of all time. Which was all the more reason I wanted to see it. But to be honest it didnt hold up to what I was expecting.<br /><br />From the director 'Eli Roth' of the earlier cabin fever, this is definetly an improvement to his work. I have noticed from some people say that this is actually one of the most disturbing films of all time. Sure it has its blood and gore, some disturbing effects in certain scenes but it also has its limits. Like some of the torture scenes through out the film you dont actually quite see what is happening but viewers react with the victims reactions, which I would consider a good thing. But people have went over the top with this movie. Most disturbing?..Not a chance.<br /><br />The thing is this movie does have its buckets of blood and gives certain good impressions of realism killings, which I would consider this to be the most successfull part of the movie, and for all the horror movies made within the last year Hostel definetly is one of them I would consider one of the few decent and fun horror films to watch.
0064435962|5.0|We have enjoyed another of Eric Carle's books--Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do You See--since my son was a few weeks old.  So, when my son was about 7 months old, I bought From Head to Toe.  It was a wonderful purchase!  After a few reads, my son was imitating the animals just like his mama--waving his arms like a monkey and on his hands and knees like the cat.  It was so wonderful for me to see that my son was understanding and processing the books I read to him.
0553382179|4.0|Many reviewers have insinuated that you'd have to be either a) dumb or b) devoutly Christian to enjoy the book (some imply that they are one and the same).<br /><br />I'm neither.  I'm university-educated, have been a single mother, working mother, etc., for the last 11 years... and just happen now to be at home with my baby, having realized that she will not be my baby for very much longer.<br /><br />Although there is much overlap, I enjoyed this book as an adjunct to the website and email \\"reminders\\".  Sure, you could read almost all of it online - but I find that online reading is far different from really-paying-attention reading.  You can glance at a website in passing, but reading a book really takes a committment of at least a couple of hours.<br /><br />To say this book is an easy read is understatement.  The book is written to a lowest common denominator, in a homey, intimate way that I notice has turned off quite a few reviewers.  Fine.  I've heard Marla's radio show enough to realize that's her real voice, and at least she isn't trying to sound phony or intellectual.  This is HOUSECLEANING, after all... not particle physics.<br /><br />And, hey, for all my university education and work/life experience have taught me, I still had no CLUE how to keep from tripping over junk, letting hazardous clutter pile up in the kids' rooms, not to mention how to make my own room a haven, a retreat I can find peace in at the end of the day.  So who am I to call Marla, or this book, dumb?<br /><br />The book outlines FlyLady's few and simple principles:  stuff like showering and putting on shoes; stuff like shining your sink even if you feel like you're drowning in stuff.  Yeah, some of it will take elbow grease - but not hours and hours of it; baby steps is all she ever asks.<br /><br />Oh, and that religious thing?  I personally believe in God, but if you don't, try substituting some less \\"offensive\\" term where she refers to her own personal inspirations.  She'll never foist it on you if you really don't want it.<br /><br />Some reviewers - who were looking for more of an organizational book for the already-organized, I suppose - have clearly thought you must be deranged or stupid to be wandering around in a nightgown at 3:00 in the afternoon.

They place copy protection, so I can't use it in my computer, so I either have to listen to it in my stereo or play the DVD side in my computer.  Not the best way to treat a fan who just dropped $15 of his hard earned money for their music, and the music indsutry wonders why they are losing money.  So, no more buying Bond or Decca products.
B0001I55SS|4.0|Capt. Don Holland (Robert Forester), Lt. Charles Pizer (Joseph Bottoms), Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine), Dr. Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins), Dr. Kate McCree (Yvette Mimieux) and their droid VINCENT (Roddy McDowall) are the crewmembers of the spacecraft Palomino.  While exploring deep space, they come upon an apparently abandoned spacecraft hovering near a large black hole.  However, the spacecraft is far from abandoned.  It turns out to be the USS Cygnus, commanded by Dr. Hans Reinhardt (Maximillian Schell).  Originally sent into space to search for intelligent life on other planets, Reinhart disobeyed the order to return to earth after his mission was deemed a failure.  He has spent the past twenty years formulating a way to journey through the black hole. <br /> <br />Dr. McCree's father was a member of the crew, but when the Palomino docks with the Cygnus, there is no evidence of the crewmembers anywhere; only Reinhardt and several of the robots he created. Reinhardt tells the others of his plan to enter the black hole.  Alex is immediately intrigued by the possibility and decides to stay aboard.  Capt. Holland senses something is up with Reinhardt and sets out to prove his suspicions are true.  Even little VINCENT has stumbled upon some important information.  He discovered another droid that looks like himself: BOB.  BOB informs VINCENT that the crew didn't die but in fact have become humanoid servants of Reinhardt.   <br /> <br />Just as Reinhardt is about to take the Cygnus into the black hole, a large meteor shower strikes the ship and causes severe damage.  Harry Booth tried to escape from the ship by himself aboard the Palomino, but Reinhardt's evil robot Maximillian shot the ship down.  Maximillian also turned his evil ways on Alex.  Only Capt. Holland, Charlie, Kate, and VINCENT are left.  Their only hope of escaping to safety is to reach Reinhardt's probe ship.  Will they make it before it's too late? <br /> <br />This is a very good movie.  The special effects are good, considering the movie was made in 1979.  The swirling black hole is especially well-done.  The meteor shower was exciting to watch, especially the large meteor that strikes the Cygnus and rolls down the middle of the ship.  The acting is good, and the story is well-conceived. Science fiction fans will be sure to enjoy this fine movie from Disney. <br /> <br />I
B000DN5W4I|3.0|i have enjoyed joes c.d's including his blues cd's so i was looking forward to this dvd to get an up close and personal look at this fine guitar player and i am a bit disappointed, while he is very tasteful and his leads are well thought out on his cd's this is just an hour of a guitarist showing off. yes he is very fast and he has a boatload of chops but this gets old and repetitive after about two songs. comparing the song blues deluxe from the cd to this dvd is night and day. on the cd he starts off tastefully and quiet and lets his guitar build momentum. on the dvd it is in your face from the get go. overall a major disappointment from a talented young superstar.
6305291446|2.0|I remember when I was in fifth grade, I snuck downstairs late at night to sneak a peek at the original Halloween when it was on HBO. I was mesmerized and scared to death at the same time. \\"The Shape,\\" aka Michael Myers, was a chilling and oddly fascinating character. The sight of his shadow on the side of a building sent shivers up my spine.<br /><br />I remember a scene that showed his silhouette against a house for a few seconds and the camera cut away as someone caught a glimpse of him. When the camera returned, he was gone. Little things like that scared me more than what little blood there was. Halloween sparked a number of imitators that added buckets of blood, but none of them had those little scary touches like the scene of \\"The Shape\\" against the wall.<br /><br />So when Halloween: H20 was announced, I was at once a little skeptical but excited. Jamie Lee Curtis would reprise her role as Laurie Strode, the survivor of the first and second Halloween movies. H20 would be ignoring those sequels from 1982 to 1996, that had basically turned the storyline into another slasher epic, with the addition of psychic powers, strange secondary characters and a complete loss of focus on the true nature of what had made the original so powerful. With a lot to live up to, Halloween: H20 had the potential to disappoint as easily as it could return the series to greatness.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie does not live up to the original. It barely matches up to 1981's unnecessary Halloween II. It tries very hard to be better than those other, now ignored, sequels, but it doesn't quite make it.<br /><br />It's now 1998 and Laurie Strode has moved to Northern California to take a job as the head of a private school. She has a 17-year old son named John (Josh Harnett), who attends the school. Laurie and John have been battling the demons inside Laurie's head in different ways.

B000EHRVP6|2.0|The last time i checked \\"Unconfortable\\" doesn't mean scary. \\"Gore\\" doesn't mean scary. \\"Violence\\" doesn't mean scary. But...horror movies...they're supposed to be scary right? At what point did this movie scare you? It was totally disgusting so yeah at times you almost have to look away. Uncomfortable? yes. Gore? yes. Violence? yes. Scary? NO.  A big budget snuff film at best. If you don't hate it...you probably own the \\"scream\\" collection that sits next to your copy of \\"The Grudge\\". Get a clue.

B000E1MXSW|5.0|\\"The Nun's Story\\" is a movie I watch everytime it shows on TV (unfortunately too rarely), plus I've had the VHS version for years. I'm not sure exactly what I find so compelling about this movie, but I find it incredibly moving everytime I see it.  <br /> <br />Audrey Hepburn is just tremendous, as is the entire cast. The story is thought-provoking in a way too few movies made today are.  <br /> <br />I grew up Catholic (though admittedly a bit lapsed today) and was educated by nuns up through high school. This movie reflects what I saw in the sisters from school - some were mean and petty, others unbelievably generous and spiritual, but all ultimately human. This movie really resonates for me, maybe because of my memories growing up.
B00005JOE8|1.0|I didn't expect this comic book-to-movie adaptation to be perfect. They never are. But this is so beyond my worst fears. A great frightening, satirical, political, and also fun and emotional adventure story has been completely ruined. Every single scene that is from the original story has been diluted in some way, not just in the sense of softening the political edge, but just plain making them less emotional, interesting, tense and original. And the new poison storyline makes no sense; it's boring, and poorly executed. And usually good actors like Natalie Portmans (accent is awful), and John Hurt (a clown, instead of the deranged but still dangerous leader of the comic) do worse than ever. This movie might impress someone who never read the original, but only because usually Hollywood action movies are even worse. Let's hope the director never gets another job ever again.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This collection is worth the money alone just for the live version of \\" Thundercrack \\" For those complaining of not hearing any quality difference in the sound I think it is time to get a new stereo . I hear things that i missed for the last 30 years . Remember this is recorded way before digital when the dvd wasnt even a thought . We were still suffering through post Partridge family , Seasons in the sun by Terry Jacks , and the emergence of the Bay City Rollers .Bruce offers refreshing lyrics and music that wasnt being heard at that time . the total collection to me is a gift at the price compared to mariah carey rereleasing the same cd for the holiday season . I thank Bruce for taking care of his fans  BRUUUUUUCE !!!!
B000E6ESL2|1.0|My word, this is a bad movie.  Confusing, boring, senseless, pointless, shall I continue or are you beginning to get the point?  I am not sure what possesses an actor like Ewan McGregor to participate in a movie like this, but then again he has made tons of horrible movies (like the Pillow Book for example).  I am losing faith in Naomi Watts, who I once considered an ally in the neo-femme movement.  After this and her atrocious work in King Kong, I've nearly forgotten how good she was in Lynch's \\"Mulholland Drive\\". <br /> <br />Speaking of D. Lynch, this movie is very much a rip-off of his style.  But it misses by a mile in it's attempts at surrealism.  Oh, and speaking again of neo-femmes falling from grace, who should turn up in a thankless cameo but none other than... Janeane Garafalo (I don't care if I misspelled her name after what she's done to us in the movement- i.e. become a turncoat).  How do you feminize Benedict Arnold?  Feel free to contact me with suggestions, but I think you catch my drift. <br /> <br />No stars would be far more appropriate.

B00003CXBH|5.0|The Mission is a great movie about the effects of a Mission in Latin America, and the effects of Colonial expansion. The Mission is not only an entertaining movie, but also holds many themes that are still relevant today. ALthough the movie is set in the 1750's, many of the themes that are taught in the movie still hold fast in the common era. From standing for what you believe in to seeing the good in everyone, there is a lot to be learned from The Mission.  <br /> <br />The Mission is a movie that everyone should see. Not only is it entertaining, but it has deep themes that really make you think.
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|A long drawn out film that is hot on action and short on people being nice to one another.  Sharon Stone is here, she's all that and then some.  Pesci is in it to, using every bad word in the book in his vocabulary.  The movie is good at going behind the scenes of what is up with the gambling industry and the mob.  It shows you what happens when people cross the wrong man.  Sooner or later of course, camelot falls, and all the kings horses, and the men on them, fall with it.  NOT suitable for children under the age of 18!dritte und vierte Band, &bdquo;Die Gilde des Todes\\" und &bdquo;Dunkel über Sethanon\\" entpuppen sich auch als &bdquo;Paar\\", denn die Handlung in diesen Büchern beginnt einige Zeit nach dem Ende des Spaltkriegs.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|It may take that many angels to provide us the same joy that Johnny Cash did in his long and fruitful life. Rather than talk about the entire CD which I think is uniformly great, I just want to make a remark or two about the title track \\" The Man Comes Around.\\" Christians and Christian theologians have been wrestling with the book of Revelations for a long time and none of them have, to my mind, ever been able to make much sense of it; then along comes J.R. Cash and in three minutes makes the most compelling and accessible intepretation of that work I have ever heard. In the liner notes he says he never took longer to write a song than this one and it really shows. He takes a complicated subject and makes a powerful and lovely artistic statement accessible to every feeling person. No need to think it through very much. I think he probably was the greatest troubadour of the last century in our language - a troubador is a worthy man who communicated important spiritual messages to ordinary people in the form of music. I wonder if something important died with Johnny Cash, something irreplaceable.

B000E6UK5K|2.0|David Gilmour is probably best known as (in his own words) \\"the voice and sound of Pink Floyd\\" and it's true that Gilmour's blues-based guitarwork is one of the reasons why Pink Floyd are still remembered today. However, we shouldn't forget that Gilmour's also had a long career as a sideman and session guitarist. He's worked with Paul McCartney, Pete Townshend, Paul Rodgers (to name a few), and has put out two solo albums in the past. To be honest, I hoped this wouldn't sound anything like Pink Floyd and wondered what the CD would be like - no samples were available for me to listen to prior to purchase. I also could care less about the Waters/Gilmour feud of the past.    Gilmour's gone after a New Age/atmospheric/ambient sound on this release, which will probably not be your cup of tea if you're looking for anything remotely similar to rock music. There's no rhythm section to speak of, and the songs fade pleasingly into the background. The vocals are always soothing, and the production values on the CD are technically excellent. I can appreciate that Gilmour is trying a different style here. I'm no expert on the genre, but I do have a few Vangelis, Kitaro, and Tangerine Dream CDs and I must say that all of those acts created music that's more interesting than what's on this CD. The opening track on this CD is quite good - when Gilmour's guitar bursts in towards the middle of the piece I was reminded of the bluesy jazz in so many classic Film Noir soundtracks. I wished there were more moments like that! By the middle of the CD, however, a sameness of material sets in. Gilmour probably intended it to be this way, but it doesn't make for a very engaging experience. I enjoy modern chillout music by groups like Air, Zero 7 and Mellow but even after several listens there's little here \\"On An Island\\" that truly stands out in my memory. There is virtually nothing that sounds like Pink Floyd, despite the frequent ambient sound effects, and like I stated earlier this is nota problem or a concern for me.    What does concern me is that this album does not succeed on its own terms. There are far better CDs in this genre for you to seek out, and if you're looking for a more engaging David Gilmour solo record, you'll have to wait until his previous two CDs are rereleased later in the year.
B000002J1O|5.0|While some may differ Selling England By The Pound, to me is the finest album Genesis released - period.  <br /> <br />For the first time Genesis spend time in the studio and make the best of it. The recording quality is miles beyond their prior albums, including the wonderful prior release Foxtrot. Beyond the vastly better sonic quality is the cohesive skills shown here. For the first time Genesis puts out a complete album where no song could go missing and not be considered ruining the album. Much as I like prior releases there are songs that could be removed and not much would have changed the album other than missing some track time, something Genesis was unusually kind about considering their long running times for an era where 40 minutes was long for an album. <br /> <br />And before people get angry, I'm not saying Supper's Ready should be excised from any album, nor many other fantastic tracks on earlier Genesis albums. I am saying that for the first and only time with Peter Gabriel, there is not a song that did not belong, although some felt differently when \\"the drummer, Phil Collins\\" sang lead vocals on \\"More Fool Me.\\" <br /> <br />Of all the Genesis albums I find Selling England By The Pound to be essential, vital and most capably played of their catalog. Opening with Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, Genesis start with what would become the launch pad for many a progressive song in the various eras progressive rock has endured.  <br /> <br />Unlike Yes, Genesis were seen as a more subdued band, or so it seemed, particularly because of it's older, less capably recorded and produced albums. What is true is that Genesis were far more economical as composers and as such, could get the point across in six or seven minutes what Yes would take ten or twelve, much spent on solos, beloved as they are. <br /> <br />Looking back, Genesis is the more direct of the Symphonic Progressive artists. They create their music, waste nothing on repitition or solos that didn't help make the song better. They wrote etherial songs along with darkly brooding and wryly funny moments. Of the progressive rock bands they were the more human. <br /> <br />Each musician was technically excellent but were also superb ensemble players and that ethos they had for years comes to fruition on Selling England. Bands would kill to have written a song of Dancing With The Moonlit Knight's quality, not to meantion lyrical prowess, something I found the worst part of many prog bands.  <br /> <br />While not a concept album, or not as far as I know, much of the album deals with English mythology and sociology with some Pythonesque commentary in songs such as The Battle Of Epping Forest and the classic, The Cinema Show. Even the ending song, Asle of Plenty has a wry humor related to what we've experienced as a song and in term of lyrical content. In that way, if Selling England wasn't a concept album there is good argument that it is. <br /> <br />On this album there are no less than five masterpiece songs, all of them the lenghtly ones. Those include Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe), Firth Of Fifth, The Battle Of Epping Forest and The Cinema Show. These tracks are the basis of the album as well, which is not to say that the remaining tracks are unnecessary. In fact, they work like connective tissue, adding tension and release and in After The Ordeal, the means of going from a rock based Battle of Epping Forest to the more dual acoustic guitar attack of The Cinema Show. <br /> <br />The lyrics are stunning throughout the album proving Peter Gabriel was more than \\"the vocalist.\\" We'd find that out a couple of albums later, but for now, read and listen to Gabriel's phrasing and stylized voices. If nothing else, I was always impressed with what Peter Gabriel could do with his already distinguished voice, but here we hear the depth to which his voice changes, and we hear it with exceptional lyrics which are his finest.  <br /> <br />As the band wrote as a group we are very much hearing a group effort, one where everyone is on the same page and thinking in complementary ways. <br /> <br />Every song on this album matters, there are reasons for them being on the album, not just that they are good songs, but that there are lyrical segments that tie into another, musical passages that have bearing upon one another. Having been a fan and seeing all their concerts for years, much of this album remained, even through the Genesis as pop stars era band using this album as the basis for their 'old songs' sub-set. <br /> <br />But of vastly greater importance few bands achieve an album that connects as their best impression of what Genesis, the band could do, Genesis, the explorers did...like introducing synthesizers as more than a flashy sound and more as another, more esoteric and melodic sounding part of the band. This is important in that their contemporaries were using synths more as a novelty the first few albums they had them whilst Genesis made it another instrument on equal footing with guitar or flute where melody was concerned. <br /> <br />Besides King Crimson, I don't feel anyone did more with less flashy playing. King Crimson brought the mellotron to the attention of many artists as more than just a cheap way of having orchestral sounds. And Tony Banks was probably the most understated keyboardist in a genre that would be cluttered with them, and yet his phrasings and actual work were nothing short of stunning! The intro to Firth of Fifth was all I remember hearing when auditioning keyboardists for my own band. Every one of them tried to play that intro, and some actually got the notes correct, but not the feel or soul that Tony Banks managed to bring to all his work. And yet there are no massive 10 minute keyboard extravaganzas to be found in Genesis' music, nor in the era this masterpiece of an album was released. In fact, it was common to wow the crowd with your musical prowess.<br /> <br />To their credit Genesis did so by playing some of the best crafted ensemble arrangements to be heard in the 70s, or any time. That this album is timeless is yet another reason why I love it so. <br /> <br />Using Firth of Fifth as another example, the solo by Steve Hackett is tremendous in it's scope. It is literally epic, so much so that to this day Hackett and anyone involved with the band have left it extant, a guitar solo that took on the place of a melodic line, and one that was climactic to boot. Phil Collins proves why he was such an amazing drummer and one of the hottest session drummers in the U.K. His style was steady yet had elements of sophistication years beyond his young age at the time. He is at his prime here and on Genesis' next opus, The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. It is no surprise that so many drummers have borrowed his style and many sounds, including some breakthrough work on Peter Gabrial's third, and many consider, best, solo album.  <br /> <br />Mike Rutheford always seemed the backbone of the band, whether playing guitar or as the bassist with sophisticated and endless fills that made you think, how did that one come about? <br /> <br />Though maybe 5 years older than me, I see artists like Genesis as the reason I plod on in music well past my prime...because there is proof that music isn't flashy sounding, handsome/sexy media candy, but a bunch of blokes that enjoy what they do and have ideas that many of us would kill to be honored to have said, \\"that was my song.\\" In the end, that is why Genesis exemplifies the progressive sound in so many bands. They were able to make listeners think beyond our normal boundries, more like artists of the written word than simply musicians. Beyond that, they were entertaining as a playing band, incorporating masks, lighting and themess on the stage; and while bands like Pink Floyd did this first, Genesis had a stronger group of songs to work with. Their images were visual in an impressionistway, leaving plenty for listeners to think for themselves, and even in the great days of the original progressive rock bands, few were able to hold a candle to Genesis, even, if only for a short time, after Peter Gabriel left the band. <br /> <br />In fact, I wrote this review because I reviewed the Wind and Wuthering album and felt that these two albums were in their own way, the best of what Genesis had to offer it's audience and music in general. Few bands can make an album of Selling England By The  Pound's quality, let alone create songs such as Cinema Show, Firth Of Fifth or the quirky I Know What You Like (In Your Wardrobe), it is equally impressive that every album they made for at least the first six years they were a band, had at least one song of the caliber found in near obscene quantity here. <br />This is a must have album for fans of Genesis, Peter Gabriel or anyone who ever said they liked progressive rock. Your parents probably loved it and their parents, still in shock over rock music, could come to enjoy it. Because great music trancends age and social boundries, and this is one of the finest rock albums made.

B0002TX4QQ|5.0|What a powerful, powerful book this is!  Deeply disturbing, yet so compellingly written, and so incredibly honest.  Kevin is a fascinating character, but I think the mother, who narrates the account of her son's murdering spree, is the real reason this novel works so well.  She is sympathetic at times -- who wouldn't sympathize with a mother who has to go through this kind of ordeal -- but only because we occasionally see her very human side, full of flaws -- like when she throws her young son across a room in anger and breaks his arm.  This is not just a story about a mass murderer; it's really more a confession of a mother who is struggling to determine where she may have failed.  The narrative exquisitely builds in dramatic tension as Kevin's cruelty towards others get more and more serious.  It's a train wreck that you see coming a mile away, and yet the suspense is palpable throughout.  Despite it's disturbing content, I would recommend this book to anyone, as long as they have a strong enough stomach for it.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie is a perfect combination of action and comedy. I never laugh out loud in movies but I do when I watch this. This is truly one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. All the deatils of the story are so strange that it is captivating. The cinematography is awesome and complements the clever plot. The chemestry amongst the cast is what makes this film great. Just watch it.
0446677450|2.0|After getting through all the fluff Rich Dad is basically for people who want to embark in a career in real estate or their own business.  It can work, but it is not a realistic approach for the average guy or girl who want's to have more money over time.  This is more like a get rich quick idea then common sense on living below your means and investing small amounts over time.  He kind of looks down on us regular folks who don't want to flip houses or take those kind of risks in real estate.  Their are some good ideas in this book and some motivational stories too, but as a realistic approach on retiring with dignity, don't bother.  If you want to go out on your own and take a chance, then it will be a worth while read, but if you want a common sense approach on investing, buy the Automatic Millionaire instead.
0895260131|3.0|This is a good look at the bloody history of Islam, a religion founded by a man who was his own prophet and apostle.  He spoke to god, and god somehow always backed what was best for him.  And it points out the falsehood of Islamic \\"justice\\".   <br /> <br />But it does this while defending and even promoting Christianity and Judaism.  Spencer comes across as a bigoted preacher than an academic.  His word choice spins Islam in a completely negative light while painting a rose sepia over the bloody history of the other two middle eastern born religions.  Why can't an academic look be just that and not be a treatise to build up one (or in this case two) religions while destroying another?
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is one F'ed up movie, but in a good way.  The movie makes you think and you know from the first frames of the film that this is one of those you'd better pay attention to or else risk missing something important.  If you're not prepared to challenge your mind then you may want to wait until your brain is ready to watch this.<br /><br />The movie gives the viewer humor, horror, teen angst, family drama, psychological thriller and sci-fi rolled into one and remains fun to watch and interesting which is the feat, I think, that makes it as popular as it is.  Donnie, the perfectly cast Jake Gyllenhaal, is a darkly troubled teen that is either, crazy, a genius or a cog in a universal scheme that has the power to save the world.  The only consistent thing is that we have to see what he's going to do and say next.<br /><br />Frank the Bunny is his horrific companion in his adventure and helps direct Donnie along his path, helping him to escape death and commit acts of violence that may or may not serve an important purpose.  Or is it all schizophrenic delusion?  This is a movie that a few minutes in you will know that many questions will arise and maybe not all will be answered by the end.<br /><br />Many people who were faithful to the original cut of the film will point out that the director's cut may not be as ambiguous as the original and therefore not as challenging for the viewer.  That may be correct.  I was very proud of myself for figuring out the main plot (well, mostly) on my first viewing, but then I had the help of the time travel book text to assist me whereas, as I understand, the original did not.  I do know that even if the director's cut is \\"easier\\" it is still one of the most thought provoking and intelligent movies around.  It is also of note that the director does not expect us to forget the original but states this is just a re-mix and can co-exist with the original release.  Considering the subject matter of the film I don't see why that can't work.  He's not pulling a George Lucas on us anyway.<br /><br />To sum it up, the movie is just too interesting to pass up.  It may sound like sci-fi but it has so many elements that it really defies that simple tag.  Watch it and enjoy the ride.that can't work.  He's not pulling a George Lucas on us anyway. <br /> <br />To sum it up, the movie is just too interesting to pass up.

B00009W0U4|3.0|Did you know that rape is a bad thing?  And beating a woman into a coma after sodomizing her half to death is also a bad thing.  If youve ever wondered if these things were truly bad then might I suggest viewing \\"Irreversible\\"... sorry about that.  What did I like about this movie?...  I think what I liked the most about this film was the camera work and how it begins with a crazy mixed up \\"Blair Witch\\" sea sick ride and then slowly calms itself as the movie slips backwards past the violence and ends (begins) with a more subdued flavor (but then spins out into Lynch land once more).  I would be wrong not to warn you about the two notorious scenes of murder and rape/beating... its pretty hard to watch, esp. the rape scene, and thats simply because it goes on and on and on - the man wants us to know that rape is a bad thing, I think.  The murder is really incredible though; the special effects and camera work for that scene is something to behold.  There's also allot of explicit gay sex and never ending dialogue about sex which gets old and uninteresting very quickly. Im not quite sure as to what Noe (the director/writer)is trying to say through this flick... life is fragile?  Maybe a ying yang thing - life is equally bad as it is good?  I dont know, but if you want to be subjected to some really bad trips then go ahead and watch this mother.  Its put together well, but it gets pretty innocuous throughout the last half - by that time you really have forgotten about the future of the characters, and for some reason you could really give a crap about what's on their minds... pretty brazen and stupid of me, I know, but thats just the way I felt.  and maybe that's what Noe wanted to say - we dont really care about people unless something bad makes us take notice... and that's sad because by that time it's usually too late to care.  check it out, it's not a real fun ride, but if you watch it you'll be able to say that you've seen \\"Irreversible\\".

B000AARKW6|4.0|Carlito's Way is the second collaboration between director Brian DePalma (The Untouchables) and Oscar winning actor Al Pacino (Scent Of A Woman), the first being 1983's cult classic Scarface.  <br /> <br />The movie, like Scarface, is about a Latino gangster only this time our main man is Carlito Brigante, a Puerto Rican, who's just been released from prison after serving 5 years. The events of the movie are narrated by Carlito himself as he recalls the last part of his life while he lies dying from gunshot wounds.  <br /> <br />Unlike Tony Montana, Carlito, played brilliantly by Pacino, does not want to to be part of the gang life anymore; instead, he wants to get 75,000 dollars and begin a legitimate business and a clean life with his old flame Gail, played by Penelope Ann Miller (Kindergarten Cop). Unfortunately for Carlito, leaving a life of crime is not going to be that easy. The District Attorney is still trying to pin something against him, his corrupt cocaine snorting lawyer David Kleinfeld, played to maximum perfection by Sean Penn (Mystic River), wants to get him involved in potential trouble with a made man, and an up and coming gangster, Benny Blanco from the Bronx, played by John Leguizamo (Empire), is really pissing him off.  <br /> <br />The movie has some cool action sequences, especially the pool table scene at the beginning of the movie, and excellent cinematography and direction (the train station chase scene at the end is vividly mesmerizing). But the best that Carlito's Way offers is the intense drama and character study, and Sean Penn's amazing adaptation of a good guy turned crooked and evil. The only flaw in Carlito's Way is the exaggeration of some action sequences (the escalator scene), and unneccesary use of parody (Benny Blanco killing Luis Guzman's character at the end of the movie). <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B+ <br /> <br />

B000AA305M|4.0|... but then that would have been one hell of a trick if it was. <br /> <br />The problem with David Gray's records post-\\"White Ladder\\" is that he now has a reputation to live up to, unlike between 1992 and 1999 when he was a failing folk-singer looking for his breakthrough. <br /> <br />2002's \\"A New Day At Midnight\\" had the unfavourable task of following up \\"White Ladder\\", and while on the whole it was not a bad record, it simply sounded like a deliberate attempt to either pick up where \\"White Ladder\\" left off, or perhaps be a clone, or even both... <br /> <br />However, despite some techno wizadry on this album too, \\"A New Day At Midnight\\" harks back more towards his early records, which therefore gives the album a less \\"bland\\" and more \\"organic\\" sound. <br /> <br />Lead single \\"The One I Love\\" went Top 10 in the UK last year, and proved a good preview, with it's joyous lyrics and upbeat yet pensive melody. <br /> <br />\\"Hospital Food\\" is more sarcastic, full of wordplay punches, while \\"Alibi\\" evokes David's 1995 album \\"Sell Sell Sell\\".  Elsewhere there's very little to equal the quality of such songs as \\"Please Forgive Me\\", \\"Late Night Radio\\", \\"Babylon\\", \\"Sail Away\\" and \\"The Other Side\\", bur fair play to David for sticking to his guns and not going the being led into trying to clone James Blunt and Daniel Powter after their success during 2005.  If his future albums continue to maintain his standards, David will be hanging around for a long time to come by the time Blunt and Powter have faded from the public memory...
B000EGCITG|5.0|I guess you just can't please some people. No matter how immaculately amazing something is, you can always... always guarantee some pesimistic individual to pop his or her head in the midst of all the celebration of a fine piece of work. In all honesty, this IS a fine piece of work. I am so very  much thankful that hard work is being put into the entirety of albums again. Now, I'm having trouble deciding which album is better... the legendary 'M!ssundaztood' or this 'I'm Not Dead'. She holds nothing back, and the guitar riffs are thick. This record reminds me of 'Breakaway'.... only, it has the twist of P!nk, her classic ingenuity, and it does to P!nk what 'Breakaway' did for Kelly Clarkson. I love her uses of political angst and social satire. Thank goodness, \\"Stupid Girls\\" reinforces the theology that sticking your finger down your throat does not guarantee success, thought it's almost a sure-fire way to gain physical emaciation. Breathtaking can't even describe the lyrical and melodic beauty of \\"Dear Mr. President\\". \\"Long Way to Happy\\" is one of those songs that can be released as a second or third single and attain Billboard's number one spot for God only knows how long. \\"U + Ur Hand\\" rocks, simply that. \\"Conversations with My Thirteen Year Old Self\\" is eerily revealing and grows on the listener. It's hard to imagine the genius of Linda Perry is absent on this album.  <br /> <br />   I highly, highly recommend this album to any fan who enjoys classic P!nk. Now, I guess all we have to do is wait for the Grammy nominations.  <br /> <br />   Welcome back, P!nk. You most certainly are NOT dead.
B000E33VWW|2.0|Philip Symour Hoffman is a good actor, and his performance in this movie is good, but not good enough to make it worthwhile. There are two keys to why this movie doesn't work:<br /><br />1. There is no conflict/climax. The thin story revolves around Truman's research and subsequent struggle with writing his book, but a short time into the movie the viewer soon says \\"who cares?\\" because there's nothing at stake. You're not rooting for or against anyone.<br /><br />2. We've seen this type of movie before (several times). You know the type - murderers are captured, and there's a person with influence who befriends/falls in love/sympathizes with the killers, and mourns them when they are executed. The difference between those movies and Capote is that they are vastly better, not to mention that the concept of convicted killers being shown as victims is troubling as it is, and is an irresponsible message.<br /><br />In all, this is a boring re-tread of a movie, especially if you are unfamiliar with Truman Capote (which most of us are). Sorry, but a writer who was popular in the early '60s has no appeal to anyone under 45. Avoid this movie. Honestly, why this was so popular with the academy had nothing to do with the quality of the movie.
B00006IRJU|4.0|I first heard the Man Of Colours album in the late eighties and fell in love with it.  It was never off my walkman and as soon as I got a CD player it was one of my first purchases.  I have to say however that I'm a little disappointed with this remastered release. <br /> <br />The version of 'Crazy' is the single version and as such is shorter.  The song 'Electric Blue' has been subtly tampered with, with the sound of the background synthesizers and some of the songs arrangement, (i.e.- going into the first chorus it used to say 'In those eyes', now it says 'I just freeze').  I now have two versions on my digital music player, the original and the remastered. <br /> <br />This album I would normally give 5 stars, but I'm giving this remastered version just four.  Remastering in my opinion is about cleaning up the sound and removing background noise, leaving a sharper clearer sound.  I have the greatest of respect for Iva Davies and his work, but an album should be left untouched once it's in the public domain.

0767827694|2.0|This film was kind of disappointing, especially since my expectations were high: an adaptation of a Woolf novel, a costume movie, gender issues... <br />Not everything about this film was bad. Tilda Swinton was quite good, the images were often beautiful, and the narrative was (on the surface) not too difficult to follow. <br />But my problem is that the film leaves so much unsaid you very quickly have no idea any more what it is about, and worse: it loses its dramatic tension. This probably has everything to do with it being an adaptation of a novel. I have not read Orlando but I know Virginia Woolf's style of writing with the long introspective passages. Maybe if you have read the novel the film makes much more sense, but now I felt like the 'knowing' glances Swinton every so often throws at the camera served to replace pages of inner monologue. <br />I can give much more examples of scenes so minimalistic that it becomes ridiculous (the moment Orlando finds out he has become a woman; the moment when Orlando is pregnant and walking on the battle fields of WW1), but I think my main point is clear: please directors, when you really want to adapt a difficult and literary novel to the screen, remember the people in the audience that don't know the book. There are already too many films that are barely more than a meagre summary of an incredibly good novel.

0670032506|5.0|David Allen's best known work is \\"Getting Things Done,\\" a guide to stress free productivity. Allen, in many ways, is a philosopher. not a time-management or productivity guru. His insights into the correlation between \\"open loops,\\" as he calls them (the things undone that rattle around in our mind)and stress are remarkable.<br /><br />  But \\"Getting Things Done\\" can be a very rocky read because Allen combines an explanation of his philosophy with a method for clearing the clutter from your mind.<br /><br />  \\"Ready For Anything,\\" on the other hand, eschews the methodology and focuses instead on the philosophy. In 52 short chapters, Allen lays out his thinking about time-management, stress and productivity. In each of these short chapters Allen expounds on his philosophy. It is much easier to digest in this form than it is in \\"Getting Things Done.\\"<br /><br />  Allen's basic thoughts aren't new or novel. If you're confused about what needs to be done, than what needs to be done won't get done. It's that simple. But Allen brings together basic principles in a new, easily understood way.<br /><br />  I see both books -- and frequent references to them -- as necessary and helpful. Allen's reputation is well justified and \\"Ready For Anything\\" is proof of it.<br /><br />Jerry

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I saw this movie three months ago, and there is not a day that goes by where I do not think of this movie.  I am not gay, but the story touched me soooo much. Everything about this movie is perfect...the breathtaking cinematography, the touching,simple score that contrasts with the complex feelings of the characters, the brilliant acting, and the flawless script.  Two of the scenes, when Ennis talks to Lureen on the phone, and when Ennis visits Jack's parents, are about as close to film mastery as you can get.  What I love about this movie is that it is so so complex, the characters, including the wives, are so incredibly rich.  Ang Lee does an amazing job with every little detail, from the bit of red nail polish on Lureen's finger during that phone call to the speckled pot that Jack's mother uses, to the different color hats that the two characters wear-Jack wears a black hat and Ennis a white, showing their ying-yang connection- Lee has truly created a GEM of a movie. The biggest praise goes to Annie Proux, whose short story was lovely. I will say this however, I loved the movie even more the second time, I just noticed so many more things.  Anyway, to sum it all up, SEE THIS MOVIE, it has touched me in a way that few recent films have. <br />I just can't seem to quit Brokeback Mountain!!:)
0142000663|5.0|This is one of the great books of this century, if not the greatest. Within its pages, it plumbs the depths of both hope and despair, hostility and love, family ties and soulless corporations.<br /><br />Probably most people are aware of the basic story line: the Joad family, forced off their land by the confluence of the great drought of the late twenties, the beginnings of mechanization of farming, and banks that care only about their bottom line, travel to California in search of work as harvesters. But once arriving, instead of the paradise they were led to expect, find little work, a hostile local population, and living conditions far worse than those in prisons.<br /><br />But this bare-bones description of the story doesn't begin to indicate the power of this book. Steinbeck's characterization of the Joad family, Ma, Tom, Pa, Uncle John, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and the tag-along former preacher Casey are extraordinary. Tom is the nominal protagonist, the decisive one who does his best to plan and get things done, but I think most people identify more with Ma, the rock around which all the vicissitudes of life thunder and break till they must retreat, defeated. Her main priority is just to keep the family together, keep on going, while still maintaining the dignity and honor that being human implies.<br /><br />But perhaps the real protagonist is America itself as it existed during this time period. The portrait of America is painted in alternate chapters from those dealing with the Joad family, mainly told from an omniscient viewpoint, and much of it reads like a prose poem. Here we find the description of the weather and farming practices that led to the Dust Bowl, a turtle determined to continue on his course, a truck stop vignette that just might break your heart, the soulless actions of the banks and land owners, the desperation and determination of those forced off lands they had farmed for generations, the used car dealers out to make a profit regardless of the pain their junk jalopies will cause the buyers, the vast river of migration that occurred in those same jalopies, and the communities that formed each night during their arduous journey to the magic land of California. These images have remarkable staying power - I don't think I'll ever forget that turtle or the dust-laden house knocked askew by the tractor. Much of Steinbeck's message and theme is presented in these chapters - one of the evils of unbridled capitalism and the virtues of socialism.<br /><br />This is a portrait of America in transition, from a mainly agrarian society to an urban mechanized one, and like all great changes the `little' people suffer the most. Here we find workers willing to work for less than starvation wages, just to try and put one more meal on the table, before their children die in front of their eyes. And the owners can offer such wages, because they know there are always enough people who are desperate enough to take those wages, and that unionization and working towards a common purpose will not work as long as there are such desperate people. Steinbeck does indicate that there might be another solution to this dilemma, namely that the people in such straits must learn some other trade (car mechanic, radio repairman), but also shows that the great majority of people will never actually make such a change in their trade.<br /><br />After each of these chapters we return to the Joad family - and see the general portrait painted in living detail, forcing the reader to see more than the abstract, to see the pain and suffering, to hope against good common sense that there is some better ending ahead. But there is no paradise, no Pollyanna future, only a slide into more and more desperate conditions. When you reach the final pages, you will find what despair truly is, right alongside the indomitable will to keep going, just keep going.<br /><br />---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)k jalopies will cause the buyers, the vast river of migration that occurred in those same jalopies, and the communities that formed each night during their arduous journey to the magic land of California.

B000002KCC|1.0|It's obvious that most Neil Young fans are thrilled with him no matter what sort of dreck he comes up with.  But speaking as a long-time (since Buffalo Springfield days; I saw the first CSNY concert) fan myself, I have to say that this one just doesn't cut it. <br />I saw Young in concert not long before this album came out, and he performed many of the songs.  These versions are poorly performed and sloppily produced.  And the album has no real point of view; despite the efforts to portray it as having an anti-drug message, it also contains such pro-drug gems as \\"Roll Another Number for the Road.\\"   <br />Young deserves credit for his ambitious musical reach, but this one, which was well within his territory, thoroughly exceeded his graasp.
B0002DH8L4|2.0|ich hatte mich wahnsinnig auf diesen film gefreut, denn ich LIEBE die 70er jahre version von king kong und dachte die neue version müsste ja mindestens genauso gut sein. falsch gedacht.<br />zugegeben die visuelle gestaltung des films ist toll, und damit meine ich nicht nur die special effects. aber wieso um himmels willen tyrannosaurus rex für einen king kong film herhalten musste, versteh ich bis heute nicht. king kong an sich ist schon eine spannende geschichte die bisher auch ohne anleihen auskam, die dinos machen das ganze bisweilen einfach nur lächerlich - vor allem bei der wilden verfolgungsjagd zwischen der crew und einer dinoherde, das nervt einfach nur und passt überhaupt nicht zur story.<br />auch die eingeborenen finde ich &quot;etwas&quot; übertrieben dargestellt - <br>die sollten wohl besonders gruselig wirken u wirken fast schon wie zombies. nun ja warum auch nicht: dinos hatten wir ja auch schon.<br />richtig ernst nehmen konnte ich den film auf grund derartiger ausrutscher aber nicht. die 70er jahre version kommt ganz ohne zombies und dinos aus und wirkt vielleicht auch deshalb viel authentischer und tiefsinniger.<br />bei dieser king kong version wurde einfach meiner meinung nach zuviel wertauf oberflächliche action und schocker-szenen gelegt, die aber letztendlich die geschichte eher ins lächerliche ziehen, auch wenns vielleicht gut gemeint war.<br />fazit: king kong fans sollten sich den film vielleicht ansehen um den vergleich zu haben, aber wer die älteren version kennt wird höchstwahrscheinlich enttäuscht sein. action- und adventurefans denen die story weniger wichtig ist, sind mit diesem film meiner meinung nach besser bedient.
B000002KCV|5.0|This is probably the Neil Young most people know and appreciate.  It is also his most consistent country-rock album.  Strangely, the best cut is his brilliant cover of \\"Four Strong Winds.\\" <br />Not many people realize that Young sometimes records songs that he has written years, and even decades, before; \\"Human Highway\\" is one example of this.  Even when this artist seems simple he is complex.
006441034X|5.0|In the land of Ingary, in a small town called Market Chipping, lives a 17 year old young woman named Sophie. Sophie's family owns a hat shop, and between her stepmother Fanny and her Father Sophie has been named the heir apparent. While Sophie learns the business of making and selling hats Sophie's younger sister Lettie (16) and half sister Martha (14 or 15?) go off to apprentice at Cesari's bakery and a watchmaker's named Mrs. Fairfax respectively. Soon all the businesses are booming, what with Sophie's ingenuity and Lettie's good looks the custom just explodes.<br /><br />One day in Market Square Sophie meets an elegant young man with blond hair who compliments her as she runs off to see Lettie. When she meets with Lettie she is surprised to discover that Lettie is not really Lettie, but in fact she is Martha under an enchantment to look like Lettie. Evidently the girls did not enjoy their assigned positions and switched with each other after administering a magical glamour that altered their appearances.  It is Lettie who tells Sophie she must stand up to Fanny by demanding a wage for her efforts at the hat shop, that she is worth more. With these thoughts in her mind Sophie heads off to the hat shop where she encounters a woman who changes her life, the Witch of the Waste, a powerful enchantress whose reputation is legendary. At first the Witch arrives on the pretense that she is hat shopping with her assistant, Gaston, but it quickly becomes obvious that Sophie is going to be compromised for her indifferent attitude towards the Witch. The witch casts a spell on her that makes her age drastically from a girl of seventeen to a woman in her later years.<br /><br />When Sophie realizes just how extreme the change is she decides to leave Market Chipping. She journeys for a time, encountering first a scarecrow that is no longer standing up. Once she rectifies this she encounters a magnificent sight, a floating castle. Now, the reputation of this castle precedes itself, it belongs to a wizard called Howl, whose dastardly deeds of consuming young women's hearts is legendary. Sophie enters the castle and discovers that it is inhabited by three persons, a young man named Michael (15) who is an apprentice to Howl, a fire demon named Calcifer who is confined to the hearth by curse and an agreement with Howl, and Howl (Howell Jenkins) himself, who turns out to be the very elegant young man whom Sophie encountered in the market. Sophie decides to stay on the pretense that she is the new cleaning lady, but in reality she is staying long enough to break Calcifer's contract with Howl so that he might break the enchantment on her once she does.<br /><br />While Sophie is there she learns all sorts of information about her hosts. Michael is a stalwart scholar determined to be a good wizard even when he falls in love with one of Sophie's sisters... Calcifer is stubborn but genuine, and Howl... at first Howl seems to be nothing more than an arrogant playboy. Why, he barely ever attends to his official duties as a wizard to the several kingdoms he serves, Michael ends up doing the brunt of his dirty work while he is off chasing women. Even when Howl is asked to find the Prince Justin he shirks this responsibility at every opportunity, too busy chasing first Sophie's sister and then his nephews school mistress to care about the missing Prince. But a curse drawn up by the Witch of the Waste that Michael unearths in the form of a spell proves that Howl's time may soon be up and it is up to Calcifer, Michael, and Sophie to redeem their friend before he falls prey to the Witches evil clutches.<br /><br />Needless to say I love this book, but let me tell you why. Initially I decided to read it because of the fact that it has been adapted into a film, and a Miyazaki film no less. I adore Miyazaki films with every fiber of my being, so when I saw this book I decided to read it before watching the movie... what a rare and splendid treat this story was.I tell you, it's been some time since a story has sucked me in to this degree. The story and plotline are wonderful, the characters so real they leap off the page at you, and the writing is so sweet, funny and nerve wracking it keeps you reading at breakneck pace. I found myself laughing loudly at Howl's vain efforts to get others to pay attention to him, and yet found it sweet when he would bestow kindness onto his comrades. And Sophie...Sophie is one of those heroines that sticks with you after you close the book, a newfound Dorothy or Alice caught up in her own version of Wonderland... this story is the stuff that classics are made of, and I am not just merely gushing because I loved the book...

I always liked her take on Me and Bobby McGee and the driving Move Over.  Try Just A Little Bit Harder is kind of spunky and I certainly appreciate all the feeling put into Summertime.  No matter what songs you prefer or not, Janis certainly left her mark on the 60's era.  This is a good keepsake to remember her by.
0449227421|4.0|This was my first experience with a Ken Follett novel and I was very impressed. The controversial topics that he explored were gripping. although parts of the story were a bit racy, such as the molestation and sex scenes, it was made obvious that it is not a children's book. I enjoyed the suspense and was literally unable to put it down. One night i was up until about 2 am so that i could get to a some what acceptable stopping point. Even then I had dreams about the upcoming events in the story. I am personally very interseted in forensic science and the theories behind crimes hoping to persue a career in that field, therfore this book was a perfect fit for me.  The clonig secrets and genetic engineering that was way before its time in this story send a chill down your spine and really make you think about whether it has already happened or not. Maybe it has!? I would suggest this book to all forensic and suspense mystery enthusiasts. Great book with tons of twists and turns that will trick you and make you cringe!

0780020685|5.0|i can't decide if this film or les Enfants du Paradis is my all-time favorite film.  (or the 7th Seal)<br /><br />I could say something obvious about this film inspiring many other films like the magnificent Magnificent 7.<br /><br />what really interests me is the way the fascinating characters interact and what each character symbolizes.<br /><br />(I could add that this film is my 16-year-old son's favorite film although he can't put into words why.)<br /><br />So as not to waste people's time, let me just say that Toshiro Mifune shows his full genius in his acting as Kikuchiyo, one of the most fascinating characters in cinema.  What is he really?  A clown or a hero.<br /><br />The other intense hero types are obviously great heroes in the tradition of Hector and Achilles but is Kikuchiyo the court jester?
0440238609|5.0|Not only has Phillip Pullman created a world of dark fantasy filled with things that pull at the depths of your imagination, his writing uses enough reality to make the events seem almost possible, but elusive, like a flash of movement that just catches in the corner of your eye. <br /> <br />They could be a little bit hard to follow at times, so I wouldn't recommend them to anyone with a short attention span. The violence wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been; most twelve-year-olds could probably stomach it. <br /> <br />These are definitely books to buy and read over and over. I'm loathe to compare them to \\"Harry Potter,\\" but both series share an aspect of adventure and mystery that keeps you enthralled right until the very end. A must-read if I've ever found one.
B000000H7I|5.0|Suffocation released their first (and best) album, Effigy of the Forgotten in 1991. This is easily one of the best DM albums out there.    I'm a huge metalhead, I listened to a lot of kinds of metal, but nothing sounded like Suffocation. From all the DM bands (or at least from the popular scene of DM) only Cryptopsy can rival it's brutality, and even they are not as good. This also has some melody (although not that much). Frank Mullen is an excellent vocalist, what constantly turned me off about several DM bands, is that the growlers sound like they vomit and it just sounds dumb. Mullen's growls are deep and low-pitched, but they are far from being ridiculous, and in my book he's 2nd only to Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt as a growler. Terrence Hobbs and Doug Cerrito are 2 of the best metal guitarists I've ever heard, they have awesome dual guitar attack which kinda reminds Slayer's axemen (Kerry King & Jeff Hanneman). The drums are also great, the bass is not really audible but it still kicks. The production is great also. My favorite song here is 'Seeds of the Suffering', and it's solo worth alone the price of the album. Other favorites are the title track, 'Habitual Infamy', 'Mass Obliteration' and 'Jesus Wept'. I love every song here but these are the best.    As the title says this is probably the best album in technical death metal. This is the best DM album to come from the early 90's. If you like grindcore, old-school DM or TDM in general you'll like this. If you're a nu-metal wh*re who thinks that Korn and Limp Bizkit are the best, STAY AWAY (and if you're one of those people, you suck).

The best thing about the book is probably the whole subplot about Ender's evil brother and loving sister, and trust me, that ain't saying much. The bulk of the novel, however, is devoted to young Ender's rather unbelievable extended military training, which mostly consists of excruciatingly dull faux-battle scenes whose outcomes are thoroughly predictable. How will Ender and his minions outwit the bad boys-yet somehow earn their grudging respect-this time? Gee golly whiz, Tom Swift, I can't wait to find out! Oy. The capstone of this book's awfulness, apart from its obvious glorification of war for children (maybe Army recruiters should hand it out to junior high schoolers in West Virginia) and its characters' obsession with farting, is Card's utterly pretentious introduction to this \\"author's definitive edition.\\" What a pompous bore! 'Tis a sad commentary on things that this man got rich and famous off of such nonsense. Anyway, if you like sophisticated science fiction with well-drawn characters and intricate plots, you should definitely look elsewhere.
B00000F5KH|4.0|Just in case you are in a hurry, I will begin this review in a non-traditional way, that is by the end. So, in a nutshell, I believe that \\"Central Station\\" is an excellent Brazilian film that you are highly likely to enjoy.<br /><br />The reasons for that opinion are many. Are you interested in them? Well:<br /><br />1- To start with, the plot is engaging. There are two main characters. One of them is Dora (Fernanda Montenegro), a somewhat cynic retired teacher that earns money writing letters for illiterate people in Rio de Janeiro?s Central Station. The other main character is Josue  (Vinicius de Oliveira), a young boy who meets Dora when his mother pays her to write a letter to Josue?s long lost father, someone that Josue longs to meet but that lives far away. Due to unforeseen circumstances, Josue ends up under Dora?s wing. The question is, will Dora help him to pursue his dream of meeting his father?<br /><br />2- Secondly, this film is directed by Walter Salles. If you have already watched another of his films, no further explanations are needed. If you haven?t, it is hight time you did. I specially recommend you to start with \\"Behind the sun\\" (= \\"Abril despeda?ado\\") and \\"The Motorcycle Diaries\\" :)<br /><br />3- Finally, \\"Central Station\\" has a talented cast that lightens the screen, and that makes justice to a story that we wouldn?t appreciate so much if the film had actors not capable of expressing so well the nuances of what their characters are feeling.<br /><br />All in all, recommended :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat
0060899190|5.0|Postsecret is an amazing and much needed effort to awaken the general public to mental health issues and healing. I, along with everyone I've shared this book with, find the contents touching and enlightening. Some of the secrets shared are incredibly humorous while others speak volumes about life's struggles. The art is as unique as the secrets themselves. This book reaches everyone. I highly recommend it.
B000E33VWW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much, but I would not recommend it to others without mentioning that the pace of the movie is \\"controlled.\\" Other viewer reviews on this page find the film to be glacial, boring, or a snoozefest. To be sure, this film has a lot of quiet in it. There are lots of long takes, reaction shots, and pauses. Background music is generally absent. This was a conscious choice on the director's part, and it worked for me.<br /><br />I've read and admired IN COLD BLOOD, and as that \\"nonfiction novel\\" is the backbone of this movie, I had a pre-existing interest level in the material. Others who might enjoy it include folks who have read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, or subscribe to THE NEW YORKER, or don't mind a slowly-told story with absolutely killer (no pun intended) acting.<br /><br />As for myself, as a kid I remember Truman Capote as an odd and boozy guest on TV talk shows. Who was this strange man with the lisping Southern accent? This film taught me how this extraordinarily gifted writer's greatest success led to his ruin. It was fascinating to someone like me, who had only known the \\"ruin,\\" not the man.
B000002URV|5.0|Listening to this album is like having a roller coaster ride. \\"Turn -off the lights!!! Take a deep breath. Relax....... Start moving slowly....very slowly. Let rythm be your guiding light.\\" - Voice of enigma.<br /><br />Sounds like meditative music. Right? Well thats the way meditators want to intrepret this album. Personally I think its like a roller coaster ride, if you listen with full involvement.<br /><br />Track1-Introduction(slow paced)(Its like you are preparing yourself to sit on the roller coaster and fastening your belts.)<br /><br />Track2(fast-medium-slow-fast paced).(Well the journey has begun and you will start to realise what I am tryin to say here.)<br /><br />Track3 (slow paced) (You are back at the begining. Two more rounds to go.)<br /><br />Track4(medium paced).(You are not having fun but eagerly waiting for the forthcoming excitements along your ride.)<br /><br />Track5(Back to origin.) (Prepare yourself for another thrilling ride.)<br /><br />Track6 and 7( The most exciting and thrilling part of the whole roller coaster ride.)<br /><br />Then you are done. Wait!!! But the kid inside of you is saying let me go for another ride . So be it.<br /><br />Must listen album for everyone. Energetic music. Micheal cretu's first official album release. If you are looking for experimental music that stands out itself from others, then look no further. Get this album and let the journey begin!!!.
B000CPGZHA|5.0|Nathalie Tineo hat es gut: Sie muß sich gar nicht erst groß um den Aufbau eines eigenen Fanstamms kümmern, die riesige Gemeinschaft der Dieter Bohlen Fans wird ihre CD sowieso kaufen. Und sie wird gut bedient... tja-wenn sie auf Dieter's Baladen stehen. Nicht alle Bohlen Fans mögen Dieter's leisen Töne. Aber &quot;Ich liebe Dich&quot; ist ein typischer Dieter Bohlen Titel, irgendwo zwischen Ballade und Midtempo Song, quasi wie aus seinem eigenen Love-Song-Lehrbuch. Das Besondere an diesem Titel ist, dass Dieter auch den deutschen Text geschrieben hat. Das ist eher ungewöhnlich, da Dieter in den letzten Jahren meistens Texter mit dieser Aufgabe betreut hat. Warum eigentlich, er kann das auch alleine ganz gut.<br>Ein netter Song, mit einer guten aber nicht überragenden stimmlichen Leistung der Protagonistin. Für Bohlen Fans ein Muß für alle Anderen vielleicht ein Anlass, es mal mit einer Bohlen Produktion zu versuchen. Für die solide Leistung 4 Sterne.ox. 4 minutes long. However, she did a \\"radio edit\\" version found on the \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" CD, therefore it is played less than one would expect. This could be both good and bad. Good if you wish to get to the next song quicker (there are plenty to go around!) and bad if you really like the song and like watching Kylie perform it.  <br /> <br />Now, one last thing. I know some songs are missing. Let's take the song \\"Light Years\\" from the \\"Light Years\\" album. If you wish to see Kylie perform that song live, check her out in the \\"Live in Sydney\\" DVD. That one is her last concert from Australia, her home town. It was made in 2001 (Showgirl was made in 2005) and has a running time of 2 hours 7 minutes. The track listing is as follows for \\"Kylie: Live in Sydney\\": <br /> <br />1. Love Boat <br />2. Koocachoo <br />3. Hand on your heart <br />4. Put yourself in my place <br />5. Medley: Step back in time/Never too late/Wouldn't change a thing/Turn it into love/Celebration <br />6. Can't get you out of my head <br />7. Your disco needs you <br />8. I should be so lucky <br />9. Better the devil you know <br />10. So now goodbye <br />11. Physical <br />12. Butterfly <br />13. Confide in me <br />14. Kids <br />15. Shocked <br />16. Light years <br />17. What do I have to do <br />18. Spinning around <br /> <br />DVD Extras include the following: <br /> <br />1. Promo video for the hit single \\"Spinning Around\\" <br />2. 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround <br />3. Backstage footage <br />4. Subtitles in English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian <br /> <br />Well, from a huge Kylie Ann Minogue fan to, hopefully, another, \\"Thank you for flying KM air. We hope you had a pleasant flight. Please, fly with us again\\" --\\"Light Years\\".
B000002UB3|5.0|It's hard to say that any album is the best one ever recorded, but this one comes close. The second half of side two builds in anticipation until \\"the end\\". I still have memories of recording this album onto cassette and watching the turning tape as the end nears, hoping that I don't run out. This album is a masterpiece. Is it the best ever? Maybe, but \\"dark side of the moon\\" and \\"days of future passed\\" are albums you should also consider \\"must haves\\". All three have to be listened to in their entirety a few times to \\"get it\\".
B00025ETIW|5.0|The fresh sound of MCR makes them easily stand out in today's generic music industry as they bring a new approach on all fronts and blatantly refuse to conform.  <br />There is not another band right now anything like these guys.  <br /> <br />In `Revenge' they showcase their new handle on song construction (virtually invisible in `Bullets') creating epic songs with story-like fluency, most notably the 3 stand-out singles `I'm Not Okay', `Helena' and `The Ghost of You'. Yet the whole album is full of songs that add into the overall themes of the band as each are great and frantically paced songs that most importantly carry the unmistakable signature of MCR.  <br /> <br />This original and genre busting major label debut is a must have for any true music fan.
B00005JOE8|5.0|\\"Remember, remember the fifth of November. <br />            Gunpowder, Treason and Plot. <br />       I see no reason why the Gunpowder Treason <br />              Should ever be forgot.\\" <br /> <br />I knew nothing about the film V for Vendetta going into it. Ideally, you shouldn't either, so don't read this review if you haven't seen the film! And you MUST see this film. It is the most interesting, subversive, and important film I've seen in decades.  <br /> <br />The movie presents a parable for our times, a post-9/11 world in which freedoms have been traded for security with disastrous results. The \\"former United States\\" is a mess. The UK has become a fascist regime enforced through the near-total surveillance of its citizens. One man, a literate, intelligent, but vengeful man, who goes by the name of \\"V\\" for reasons revealed as the film progresses, has a vendetta, indeed, but it's much more than a personal one. Knowing that he has the power to change things, possibly for the better, he decides to take matters into his own hands. V cloaks his identify behind a Guy Fawkes mask, and becomes a terrorist. <br /> <br />Or is terrorist the right word? He isn't trying to terrorize the citizens of London. He's trying to rouse them from their fear-induced slumber. He tells them that if they are unhappy with the way things are going, if they are looking for people to blame, they need to start by looking in the mirror, as they were the ones who stood by complacently as their world disintegrated. He invites them to join him at Parliament a year from that date, the next November 5, so that they can witness the act Guy Fawkes never got to finish. Why? Because there's something wrong with the country, and everybody knows it.  <br /> <br />Natalie Portman portrays the character Evey (\\"E V\\", V articulates with relish, noting that there are no coincidences). Throughout the film, after every new revelation about V, Evey asked my own questions. Was V a good guy or a horrible guy? Should one support his choices or not? Would I choose his path, given similar circumstances? At what point is the law the problem, when the law is used to justify heinous deeds? At what point is one justified in breaking it? <br /> <br />As someone who believes in the power of nonviolent, legal, collective action, the film was both disturbing and intriguing in its implications. The act of blowing up Parliament in the film had nothing to do with violence, and everything to do with symbolism. As Evey noted, the people needed hope more than they needed the building. And the blowing up of Parliament was a show of strength. As V had said early in the film, \\"People shouldn't be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people.\\" Blowing up Parliament was a way for the people to reclaim their power. And feeling that power, they might yet right the wrongs that had been done in their name. <br /> <br />I loved the story and movie on so many levels. The writing was brilliant, even Shakespearean at times. (Indeed, the Bard was nearly a character in the film, so often was he quoted.) The images were sleek and dark and sterile, like the world in which the story takes place. V's underground home was strange yet inviting, and warmed considerably by the slow jazz emanating from his jukebox. And everything had a meaning, including the signature roses V left with each of his vendetta victims. <br /> <br />The acting was compelling. You wouldn't believe a man in an immobile mask could make you feel so many emotions. Through his voice, his body, and somehow through that masked face, I felt every joy and anger and pain that V did. I will be forever in awe of Hugo Weaving's impeccable, faceless performance, as well as Natalie Portman's moving portrayal of a woman who came to discover ultimate freedom by choosing integrity over fear. And the love story between them was incredibly compelling. I was falling in love with V too, even as I deplored some of his actions. <br /> <br />I was surprised at the fairly overt parallels to the 9/11 controversy, especially given that the graphic novel on which the film is based was written in the 1980s, well before the attacks.  <br /> <br />In the film, the big \\"terrorist attacks\\" that resulted in the newly fascist society came in the form of a virus unleashed in the UK which wiped out hundreds of thousands of people. At one point, one of the government investigators searching for V, portrayed by the always interesting Stephen Rea, starts to open his mind. He asks his fellow investigator a question to which he requires no answer. In his world, the act of asking the question was itself a very bold step: \\"If our government was behind the attacks, would you really want to know?\\" <br /> <br />Perhaps my favorite sequence was the one in which Rea suddenly starts seeing all the puzzle pieces fall into place, how \\"Everything is connected.\\" In a brilliant series of intercuts, he glimpses the past, present, and future--the throughline of history. As V says, \\"for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\\"  <br /> <br />Interestingly, the future Rea envisions in that moment does not entirely come to pass, but might have, had he been successful in his effort to capture V. Ironically, his failure to stop the \\"terrorist\\" ends up saving an untold numbers of lives. <br /> <br />The most thrilling part of the film, for me, came at the end, as masses of people come out to stand in support of V's actions. There's something about people taking massive, collective action that inspires me to no end. We have the power to do amazing things, together. No force on earth can resist the masses when we act righteously in unison. As V said, in a quote I'm badly mangling, you can kill people. But you can't kill ideas. And ideas carry tremendous force. <br /> <br />As some reviewers have noted, with a sentiment I want to echo, we should all take heart in the fact that a major studio (Warner Brothers) backed and released this film. If we were truly living in V's world, such would not have been possible.  <br /> <br />The movie is a warning, not a reflection. But we would do well to examine the road we are on.  <br /> <br />And then do something about it. <br /> <br />Remember, remember the fifth of November.... <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004VVND|4.0|A bit campy in spots, a bit ahead of its time in others, Westworld looms as a potential goldmine for trilogy-happy Hollywood.  Introduce an all-star cast at the beginning, split them up to the three different worlds, and end the first film with the characters escaping their grisly fate... only to find themselves in Medieval World.  Repeat formula for the second part, adding in the characters who went off to that park, then shunt the survivors off to join the rest at Roman World for the big third film finale.  Seriously, why is somebody not making this already?
B00005JO20|5.0|I've never really been a big fan of King Kong, but I have seen all three versions. I think my mom took me to see the 70s version when I was a kid. Anyway, last night I sat down and watched Peter Jackson's latest version. Although the movie is 3 hours long, I didn't even notice. Some movies are too long at 2 hours, but Kong was just right at 3 hours. The length of the movie matches it's grand scale. Overall, I must say that King Kong lives up to the hype - a wonderfully wild ride. It reminded me of the first Indiana Jones movie - a modern movie with an old serial adventure feel.<br /><br />Kong weaves a fantastic story in a believable fashion, pulling few if any punches. The relationship between the female lead (Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow) and King Kong is both refreshingly realistic and poignant. The movie has a depth of story which I wasn't expecting. The scenes of depression era New York are absolutely stunning in it's realism. Jackson should be commended for this alone. He also spends a good deal of time on character development. Most of the characters are multi-dimensional, but it is clear that the main characters are Ann Darrow and Kong. Interestingly, it is Kong himself who undergoes the greatest transformation from beginning to end.<br /><br />Be warned - there is plenty of violence - Skull Island is no place for the faint of heart! I'm not particularly squeamish, but there are two scenes involving larger-than-life bugs that I won't soon forget - ugh! I read an interview with Jackson who said the original 1930s version had a similar scene which was removed after the initial screening - apparently people in the audience got nauseous and some even threw up. Jackson pointedly (and eagerly) added his version of the 1930s deleted scene - gee, thanks!
B0007NMKB2|5.0|This CD has no less impact than when it came out eighteen years ago. As Byron Coley says on the band's website, it shows their sound becoming more orderly as they were ready to burst from internal strife. Well, sad but true, but tension often makes for the best music of a band's career, and J didn't live up to the manic glory here ever again. (Now this line-up is reunited! Got to see them for the first time with Lou on bass last week. HO-LY CRRRRRAAAP!!!).<br /><br />So many highlights, where do you start? I think Kurt really learned the soft/hard dynamic from J, and in many ways J's use of it sounds more fresh (likely because a trillion J wanna-be's failed to ever pop up--only a score, Kurt being one of them). The album starts with this in somewhat famous fashion on \\"Freak Scene,\\" where there's a major chord strumming pattern that is mildly distorted. Within in a minute, the low E power chord is thrashed so hard that the piece resembles a form of proto-death metal. The middle part is really pretty . . . and then back to the death metal. A lot of the songs feature this dynamic & it really never gets boring. If you have the right tools, use them to make as many creations as possible. I think my favorite use of this dynamic is in \\"Pond Song.\\" It starts out with a delicate picking pattern: \\"Long distance left you undecided/ I'd sprinkle enough to let you know,\\" J pathetically croons to the girlfriend he never finds. Before you know it, the song is awash in fuzz, reverb, and thrashing chords. This pattern happens to match J's attitude towards his love interest, which alternates between tender yearning and murderous disenchantment, best reflected in \\"Freak Scene\\": \\"Sometimes I don't thrill you/ Sometimes I think I'll kill you./ Just don't let me f**k up will you,/ 'Cos when I need a friend it's still you.\\"<br /><br />There's so much more to say about this classic, but I will leave it at the guitars for now. Simply put, the interplay between J on guitar and Lou on bass remains a high watermark for alternative. Sometimes muddy, but always evocative of new and fresh emotions, there have been few power trios who have got as much out of their guitars (Rush comes to mind, tho' I know the hipster \\"cognoscenti\\" would poo-poo me for saying this). Lou ups the ante with his use of chords and arpeggios on the bass for one thing. J himself is certainly one of the top guitarists in the history of alternative. He's not a harmonic genius in the technical sense: more in the intuitive sense. His use of feedback is heartbreakingly beautiful at times (the solo in \\"No Bones\\" amply evidences this). He uses dissonance strategically, creating hooks out of repeating skronky lines after a particularly melodic run (again, the second solo in \\"Freak Scene\\" is great for this). He shreds the thing like he's, well, ready to break it in two. Oh yeah, and it's LOUD. I saw them live (without Lou) back in the early '90's. J would play solos and my head literally felt like it was being cleft at the lobes. It hurt!!! But it was the true definition of sublimity: intense pleasure mixed with intense pain. You, too, may be able to feel the pain if they come to your area and smash your head on the punk rock.<br /><br />Last contrast: I played this to my girlfriend for the first time today. She liked it a lot. Of all the grunge bands in the '90's, this was a good one for the women, 'cos J writes more traditional melodies and also wears his heart on his sleeve, unlike, say, the phrygian modes and D&D bludgeonings of Soundgarden. Male/female, yin/yang, silence/noise, love/hate, within/beyond . . . _Bug_ has more than enough contrasts to keep you occupied for a long, long time to come.ass remains a high watermark for alternative.

B000001ESF|5.0|Ok, first I want to comment on a reviewer here. Granted, this is America, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but the reviewer Prigles,Die! is an angst-ridden 16 yr old who thinks Green Day and Linkin Park are \\"great bands\\". I'm sorry to say that anyone who thinks GreenDay is great, but Nickelback, who did a ROCKIN! cover of Saturday Night's Alright(for fightin) with Kid Rock(!) of all people, sucks, should really have their sense of values checked. As to great bands, well, as great bands go, neither Green Day nor Linkin Park will stand the test of time the way Rush has.<br /><br />Started in the late 60's and still packing Stadiums today, this trio of Musical Magicians continue to wow audiences all over the world (Want Proof: Rush in Rio: 50,000+ Screaming Fans!) with a dynamic sound that seems to flow with the changes. Even today, when operatic rock has normally left mainstream radio airplay, you can still find cuts from 2112 on Rock Radio. (Want more proof: Stream some [...] and you'll see what I mean.)<br /><br />I enjoy all types of music, as my Media Player can attest to, having a wide range of artists from AC/DC to ELO to Judas Priest and Iron Maiden to Red Sovine to Styx to Toby Keith (I love this Bar!), but a serious hold over from my youth has always been Rush.<br /><br />As a cross country trucker, I find myself listening to their music more then any other, and really just LISTENING to how they play, the individual instruments and how they work so seamlessly together.<br /><br />All time favorite Rush tracks: Live La Villa, Red Barchetta, Time Stand Still, and Ghost Rider.<br /><br />All Time Favorite Album: A three way tie between 2112, Signals, and Grace under Pressure, with Moving Pictures a very close second.<br /><br />To my fellow Rush fans, don't be put off by people like Prigle, he/or she just needs to mature...alot..<br /><br />To the rest of you, don't let time stand still...
B0001932ZA|4.0|I thought the movie with Anold Schwarzenegger was exellent and well done.  I liked the plot and special effects.  It was well done with action, suspense, and drama. I relaly liked how he dealt with hard times and how he fought to the end. It brought back great memories of when I originally saw it.  It should be a collectors item.
B000EGCITG|5.0|P!nk's new album totally blows me out of the water, and shows great musical maturity all while keeping the same definat and willfull aspects of her personality. Her first single Stupid Girls is a hit and a great song. <br />Keep up the good work, P!nk
B0007XT87G|5.0|Deadwing is not a bad album at all. The first time I was exposed to it, I was somewhat disappointed. It took me a very long time to appreciate it. Compared to In Absentia, Stupid Dream, Signify and Lightbulb Sun and other PT albums Deadwing seems flat and uninspired. Comparing Deadwing to the entire field of music put out at roughly the same time is easy. Deadwing is clearly better.  <br /> <br />With Deadwing,  I miss the beautiful fusion of very hard rock and light airy music playing off each other in perfect harmony on so many other PT albums.  Deadwing seems a bit flat to me. Deadwing should not be the first Porcupine Tree album for new Porcupine Tree fans to listen to,  because that would give the wrong first impression of the band.  <br /> <br />The point is, Porcupine Tree has put out much better stuff than Deadwing. If Deadwing is all you've heard from Procupine Tree, I have a piece of advice for you. Backlog! You won't be disappointed!
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is wonderful.  My eight year old daughter loves it, and what is great is that my husband and I also enjoy playing this game.  It is great in getting a child to figure out a strategy so you will have room later on in the game.  I would recommend this game to anyone.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I awoke to \\"Put your records on\\" on the clock radio in London and couldn't get it out of my head. I loved it at once, and as soon as I got back to the states I started trying to figure out what the song was. Had to go to the BBC website and find it on their playlist. Thank goodness they had it listed or I would have gone mad trying to find it -- it's a great song, a new classic, and every other song on this CD is just as good. This is my new drive-with-the-sunroof-open, clean-the-house-with-stereo-at-full-blast, remember-the-lovely-nights-we-had-in-London CD that I'll play over and over and over. CBR, please start work on another one!
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|Sample based music has not sounded this good since DJ Shadow stepped on the scene with \\"Endtroducing.\\" Not that I am comparing Dilla to Shadow, they are both masters of their craft and very different crafts they have mastered. Where Shadow only works with a select few emcees, Dilla has been producing for emcees most of his career. His work has shown no particular love for either coast being involved with both Tribe and Pharcyde heavily in the early to mid nineties before going home to link up with his Detroit brethren Slum Village. As he grew his sound did to demonstrated by his work with the Okayplayer collective. Dilla eventually found his way to Madlib and the stones throw family and one could say that was the first stepping stone to the birth of this album. Dilla was always  known for his samples and the art of digging up just the right loop for that perfect beat, and Donuts is no exception. Made in large part while he was in the hospital fighting Lupes (the disease that would eventually claim his life on February 10, 2006) and other complications arising from it, Dilla never could put in enough work. He had released three other beat tapes similar to this one to the mixtape circuit in the last few years and has two more albums on deck for this year and next. Donuts shows all his artistic influences over the course of its thirty one tracks from dusty drums, to the soul and funk of the sixties and seventies, up to that new Madlib funk that must of rubbed off on him. Dilla was a genius with the turntables and sampler always knowing what the beat needed to be complete. With this album he knew that his time was coming and as it draws to a close you can just feel the samples he chose shouting out to you saying thank you and goodbye. Well Jay Dee it is us the listener who should be saying thank you, we love you and goodbye, Rest in Peace the one and only J Dilla AKA Jay Dee.
B000001FY5|5.0|This is one of Marley's most perfect statements - maybe his best album. It contains 5 of his most famous songs and 5 of his most underrated songs.. This is probably Marley's most profound statement as an artist and songwriter - it is not quite as raw and hard edged as the original wailer albums with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer - but this is his most mature album as far as song writing goes..Essential!
0812975219|2.0|We are experiencing a dramatic shift in America where individuals are assuming greater risks.  The old defined retirement benefits plans are being replaced by defined contribution plans (i.e. 401k plans).  Under these contribution plans, it is the employee who makes the investments decisions and faces a loss in retirement wealth when these investments sour.  Job security is not what it once was.  Our future well being is becoming increasingly dependent on random events.  This makes the topic in Taleb's \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" very timely.  In order to make good decisions, we need to be both financially and statistically literate.<br /><br />Taleb's book gets us off to a good start.  All too often we mistake random events with deterministic ones particularly when judging a person's past performance.  If this book is worth buying it is because of the Table P.1 that summarizes how we can make faulty judgments by \\"being fooled by randomness.\\" After this, it deteriorates.  He does not explain important concepts correctly, and he tries to give the impression that nobody accounts for randomness.  He criticizes mathematicians for ignoring randomness, even though there is an entire field in mathematics devoted to understanding randomness.  Taleb is confused.  Risk adverse individuals attempt to avoid the potential ill effects of randomness; however, this does not mean that they avoid the understanding of randomness.  Randomness can be synonymous with vulnerability.<br /><br />The book is filled with contradictions where he says one thing and a few pages later reverses himself.<br /><br />For a PhD he has an amazingly poor grasp of probability theory.  No wonder he does not like mathematicians, he does not understand the discipline. Although he claims that financial markets are unpredictable, he claims to have a trading strategy that guarantees him positive profits. Go figure.  No where in his book does he discuss the concept of conditional expectation.<br /><br />His fictional characters are not convincing.  The \\"risk averse\\" Nero is supposedly buying Treasuries when he could get a higher and equally safe after tax return with buying municipal bonds.<br /><br />The worst part of this book is the moral implications.  All of life is uncontrolled randomness.  Our decisions and our efforts do not matter and there is no role for personal responsibility.  People who do try to explain randomness or who try to take responsibility are personally attacked.<br /><br />After writing this book, Taleb appeared on CNBC TV.  He told the announcer that if a person comes into your office and uses the word \\"standard deviation\\", you should throw him out.  The announcer asked Taleb why this should be done. And Taleb responded, \\"Because everything is not normally distributed.\\"  Do I need to say anything more?fictional characters are not convincing.

156898443X|5.0|Such real writing and drawing here. I couldn't put this book down yesterday when I got it. This guy combines his drawings and his thoughts about life in a way that is just so honest and human. He opens up his life (and medicine cabinet) for everyone to see. I highly doubt that you can read/look through this book and not want to start your own drawing journal.<br /><br />My favorite parts:<br /><br />* Danny's Drawing in the beginning of the book where he traced Jack's hands and then drew the view from Jack's window. -Oh, I loved that!<br /><br />*The honest account (the thoughts and the drawings)of the trajedy that changed their lives.  (ie: - \\"I didn't know anyone who was married to a cripple. I didn't know anyone who was disabled at all.\\")<br /><br />- And the part about how the people acted to him at work following his wife's accident.<br /><br />*I liked the drawing of the Books with the statue book end- I've read almost all of them!<br /><br />*I liked the drawings of people in various places. Which makes me wonder what people must think when they see someone looking them over and then writing or drawing in a book. How funny that these people are out there somewhere and most likely have no idea that they've been drawn and included in a book. Makes me want to get brave enough to go out in public and draw.<br /><br />I love this book. This is a book I will revisit many times over.  I got this book after I bought \\"The Creative License\\" -Which I also highly recommend. These books have changed the way I look at ordinary things. I see normal/boring things that I usually wouldn't pay a bit of attention to -and now, I think about how I would draw that. I take a small sketchbook with me everywhere now. It's really cool.<br /><br />One of the great things about this book and \\"The Creative License\\" is that it gives you the confidence and the desire to draw/sketch even if you've never drawn before. You see Danny's drawings, and it just makes you want to try it too. Once you start it though, you're hooked and you want to draw or sketch everyday!-And why not? It's fun!nce you start it though, you're hooked and you want to draw or sketch everyday!-And why not? It's fun! <br />
B000003C2U|5.0|With this album, the band took the progressive sound they had hinted at on Spiritual Healing and brought it forward even more. Around this time, Chuck pretty much gave up on working with a regular band, and chose to just work with session musicians. And here we have some damn good musicians. On guitars we have Chuck (of course) and Paul Masvidal. Steve Digiorgio is on bass, any metal head knows who he is. Sean Reinert is on drums, and he is AMAZING, when you hear this guy, you wonder if his drums are being annihilated as he is playing! This album also has more melody than previous albums, but still stays fast and crushing.  <br /> <br />The album starts brilliantly with Flattening of Emotions. Sean does good drumming at the start, and then some heavy riffs come in. About 50 seconds into the song, the song just comes out of nowhere and destroys you. The drums on this song are insane. The solos have somewhat of a sad feel, very good melodies we have here. Suicide Machine is an all-out killer, with some of the most brutal riffs, but still a keen sense of melody in a few of the riffs. The solos have a bit of a creepy feel to them in my opinion. Together as One proceeds to kick your ass immediately after it starts. Very fast playing from these guys! I love the part when Chuck goes \\"A living hell has begun.\\" And he immediately begins his solo, which has a great melody. It is amazing how a death metal band can add so much melody, yet still stay brutal. Some of the riffs during the verses are pretty catchy as well. Secret Face starts off mid-paced, but not long after, the speed picks up. Sean is a monster on the drums here. I aboslutely love Chuck's solo on this song, it starts off very melodic and then turns more wild.  <br /> <br />See Through Dreams begins pretty heavy, but it actually has some pretty melodic riffs. Chuck really does write some amazing lyrics, I wish I had the songwriting skills this guy had! His lyrics really make you think a lot, something not a wholelot of death metal bands do. This song really does show how the band can combine sheer speed with a keen sense of melody. Cosmic Sea is an instrumental, and a damn good one at that. It starts off very peacefully, then it soon gets going, but it never gets brutal. The guitar sounds are absolutely incredible, if I could play the guitar, I would be so desperate to learn this song. Some of the best solos you will hear are on this song, and the middle section about two minutes in is mesmerizing. It is very atmospheric and calm, with neat sound effects. Lack of Comprehension has a beautiful intro, with soft guitar sounds. But don't let your guard down because this song gets pretty brutal. And fast as well, I can't help but headbang! Sean again shows his drumming talents, and Chuck gives us another solo filled with melody. This brilliant album ends with Vacant Planets. It begins with some cool-sounding riffs, you have to hear them. Is it just me or is this the heaviest song on the album? It sure seems like it to me. Paul and Chuck give us some wild solos on here, and Sean is all over his f*cking drum kit. The lyrics \\"Are they the examples of regression/A life form's abusive progression\\" stand out to me, I told you Chuck was a good song writer! <br /> <br />Well there you have it. This album showed metalheads just how far metal could be taken. Can you imagine hearing this back in 1991? People were probably at a loss for words! I know I would have been. There is so much brutality on here, yet there are also many beautiful melodies. And to think that Chuck's genius would increase even more with their next albums is mind blowing. Human is definitely an album for people that want to headbang, but tire of the usual \\"blood and guts\\" lyrics that death metal bands tend to give. This album gets a big recommendation from me!
B000E5N62U|1.0|I saw Fagen in Chicago on 3/18/06. He started 20 minutes late, ended early, and only gave an encore of one song. He did mostly stuff from this album, and didn't seem to want to \\"entertain\\" that night. \\"Bright Nightgown\\" is the most tedious song he's ever done, with his backup singers repeating that title for a good 5 minutes or so. In light of his \\"performance\\" if you want to call it that, there's no way I'd buy this album.
B000002JOH|5.0|I've been reading some of the reviews and some of them just dont respond very good ( the ones that are idiotic when it comes to righting stupid and poor reviews). I think personally what separated Pantera at the time and made them call themselves the king's of modern-day metal was that they could go commercial and present it in a very heavy way, that's why the genre is called \\"heavy metal\\", anyways, just a balls to the wall cd. recommended if you like this style of music.
B000EGCITG|2.0|I like the subject matter she goes after,but the problem is to me she just ain't convincing of a All-around artist to make it work. to me she is one more Brick from being almost forgotten. in truth for that she claims to not stand for She is more closer to it. I think Pink would be a good fit in the Black Eyed peas because Pink has a Commerical 6th sense,but doesn't always get the results fully out there. Pink is trying to be a Cross Between Pat Benetar with a Bette Midler sass,but Pink also has a Britney spears pop vibe that is obvious.this album is aight.I  think Pink is a workable vocalist who has some interesting subject matter like the song with her dad,but when She is talking about other chicks&what they do within the context of there career&then seeing the way Pink's own musical stylings are I just don't bite it. dime a dozen.
B0006L0LOS|3.0|You know, with all the limitless amount of bad reviews and even worse word-of-mouth, you sooner or later start believing in them as well. That's exactly what happened to me. I accepted all the big name critic's reviews, and what everyone else has thought of this movie. And so, I began trashing the movie too, ever since pre-production. I snapped out of recently, realizing how it foolish it was not to give something a chance just because of the bad reputation it gets. This was definately not the way I was raised, and so I watched the movie. And yes, to a delightful surprise, it definately is not as bad as you and everyone has said it to be.<br /><br />Halle Berry plays Patience Philips, a very shy and picked on woman who isn't happy about the way her life turned out. Working for a beauty company, she untiringly creates ads as her job. One day, through unfortunate events, she is resurrected as a Catwoman, which we'll soon find out has been a strong and very independent line of women in history who has been given a second chance and look on life.<br /><br />Seeing that Halle played the out-of-costume Patience very genuinely and without effort, I was kind of expecting the worse when Catwoman was being brought out of Patience. I remember what people said when Catwoman did the many cat traights in the film, like the purring and in the infamous \\"catnip\\" ball scene. I expected to cringe at those moments, but smiled at how campy they were. Very essential to the character, but not in excess it'll drive you crazy. Actually, those moments were very short, and realizing that Patience was getting used to her new personality and cat habits, it's not surprising that she'll lose control and go catty. But towards the end of the film, you see how Patience is beginning to control her dual personas, a job that I think Halle did very well on. And this Catwoman is not as horrbile as those played in the 1960s, by Eartha Kitt for example. If you've seen and remember the old shows and movies, you know how bad this Catwoman could've been; every word coming out of Halle's mouth would've been with a purr of the end, and she would've been much more ditsy and loose, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is a little cheesy, yes I agree with that. But it was something that I definately haven't seen on screen before! A beauty company turning their consumers into addictive, cracking human boulders?! Laughable, but something orignal at least. I also thought this Catwoman not being associated with Gotham or Batman was also trying something new. We've already seen the orignal Catwoman in \\"Batman Returns\\", and  Selina Kyle's story. As nice as it would've been, making a movie about Selina Kyle would have just been recycling much of that character from \\"Batman Returns\\".<br /><br />There were many things that I ddin't like about the film. The costume is too exposing and unrealistic. Purely there for eye candy. It doesn't really matter though, the costume doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film for me. There was also way too much CGI in the movie. Although many of the skyscrapers, for example, were realistic, most of the others things weren't. Things that could have been filmed with the real things, were replaced with CGI. Cats, surroundings, and Halle herself. Even moments when Halle was just standing on a balcony were completely CGI. And I thought Frances Conroy's character as the \\"Catmaster\\" was really out of place, but at least Patience's transformation doesn't go unexplained. And the best friend character played by Alex Borstein is so cliched, but a girl has to have some girlfriends.<br /><br />So bottom-line: This movie is perfect for a night of lazy entertainment. The acting was good by all the characters, the action scenes were realistic and well choreographed, the sets were dazzling, the chemistry between Tom and Patience was very romantic, and the message of the film; being strong, independent, and unafraid of life's joruney is something we all can live by. And cats!! So many cute cats too. :-)cute cats too. :-)
B00005YW4H|5.0|I thought this album was great. It was a very stressful time in my life and I went into the vitamin store and they were playing Norah Jones and she just calmed everything down and I didn't want to leave the store. If you need some peaceful moments with a high tech stressed society at times Norah is a good voice to hear. I always received the same calm blissful feeling from her dad Ravi Shanker's playing since a tiny kid. I love their music and spiritual energy. I too have sung my whole life and I feel a kindred spirit with Norah's music. I bought a copy soon as I could. I used to teach voice and coach voice students but Norah has this beautiful natural voice that is timeless.
B00005221M|2.0|The movie itself is a romantic epic in fabulous and dramatic style. However, I'm not writing this review to review the movie itself, I want to comment on this release. <br /> <br />The Director's Expanded Edition of Last of the Mohicans is a real let down for me. First of all, I picked up this DVD at Wal-Mart as an impulse buy even though I already own it on VHS. When I saw \\"Director's Expanded Edition\\", I instinctually expected a multitude of special features, deleted scenes, added content, and digital quality to a movie I already place on my list of all time favorites. I really should have looked past the shiny foil box to look at what I was actually buying. <br /> <br />First of all there are NO special features! NONE. NADA. ZIP. ZERO! Not a single feature. Not a \\"making of\\" special, not a single deleted scene or commentary, not even a trailer. A French audio track, Spanish subtitles, and an animated DVD menu is all the features you get with this DVD other than the feature itself. A real pity since this is a movie deserving of a behind the scenes featurette and perhaps some more features relating to the period. Especially given the feature itself was altered, you would think that there would be some added material from the director to highlight the changes (as was done with the Extended Edition of Gladiator, for example). <br /> <br />Sadly, the lack of features isn't the only problem here. The feature itself is not the movie you and I all remember from the theater and from years of VHS existence. No. The director, in his infinite wisdom, has decided to re-edit the movie: thus, the \\"Director's Expanded Edition\\". From what I can tell, some material was added and some removed, and some tweaked around a bit. Now this is all well and good, but then at least tell us what you've done, where and why, and more importantly you BETTER give us the option to view either this new version OR the original theatrical version. No, this DVD breaks the cardinal rule of DVD directors cuts... it takes the option out of our hands of whether we liked it better BEFORE or NOW. Especially with a movie like this which is so loved by so many and has such a respected place in movie history (I would call it a modern classic), you had better let fans of the old version have the option of seeing it plain in addition to your \\"improved\\" version. Sadly... we got jipped.  <br /> <br />To add to the frustration, there isn't a \\"regular\\" edition even AVAILABLE right now in the U.S., so we're all stuck with the director's new judgment (which can't be that great if he had to change his mind about a movie that he made a decade ago and won so much praise in its previous state) unless we want to get a British copy (the British version is the original edition) and get a region-free DVD player. UGH! I HATE DVD politics. I'm tired of trying to find my favorite movies on DVD only to be confused by 4 different editions, or in cases like this getting jipped by not having ENOUGH choice. Sometimes I miss VHS, buying my movies was much simpler then... when no one really cared about features or audio formats or widescreen. But I digress. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that if you want the original movie... you gotta get the VHS version or go British. Either that, or buy this version and see if you notice a difference... and mind not getting any extras. Either that... or wait until they release another edition. I hate to say it, but I wonder if maybe they just want to be able to re-release it again later, and get more of my money. <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It's out, it's about and it's still a moving love story.<br /><br />Unless you broke your back and have been incommunicado or living off in the vast wilderness on some mountain, you've heard much - perhaps too much - about this film. But Ang Lee's groundbreaking film, as much about the restraints of role-playing and societal expectations as the angst and amore between two itinerant male ranchers, deserves, deserves repeated looks. Seeing the film on a small(er) screen works for and against the movie; the haunting sadness that permeates the tale is a tangible, claustrophobic ache; the awesome expanse of the outback is reduced to screen-saver souvenirs. The acting is subtle and superb; we are consistently drawn to the subtly nuanced performance of Michelle Williams. She may have lost the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, but her work remains powerfully passionate and potent, an essential reminder that love - all love - that will never grow old.

It's a ground breaker!
0790729725|5.0|The movie itself is bar none one of the best mob movies ever made...no arguments there.   What disappointed me was that this particular DVD release was not enhanced for widescreen tv's even though the DVD packaging indicates that it is enhanced for widescreen tv's! This was an error made by Warner Brothers and they have not fixed the problem (bringing into question whether this is false advertising on their part).  So if your looking to buy the movie and want it compatible with your widescreen tv then DO NOT buy the cheaper single disc version of the movie..you have to buy the more expensive two disc special edition.

0446607274|4.0|First of all let me start off by saying that if anyone else had written this novel it would probably get a five star review.  However, when it comes to comparing Connelly with...well, Connelly-Angel's Flight falls a bit short.  A hotshot civil rights attorney (You get one guess who this character is modeled after) who has made a career out of suing the LAPD (of course we have never heard of him until this book) is killed one night on a sort of subway train on his way home.  Bosch and his team (more like gofers) are called to the scene.  Bosch soon finds he has to work with IED, FBI, and even the master general on this case--but still all of them are extremely absent.  Plus, I was struck by how much this book resembles another Connelly novel: The Poet.  The Pedophilia websites and fake suicides.  Plus, Bosch is making mistakes that Bosch doesn't usually make.  Bosch even retells a story about he's able to figure out a suicide of some young girl was really a homicide by the fact the girl boiled eggs on the day of her murder, but when it comes to his ex-partner (again, a character I never remember hearing about) supposedly takes his life with a mysterious gun, Bosch buys it hook, line, and sinker???  Plus, Bosch hates loose ends, but we never find out who the pedophile is with the kincaid's daughter.  (The mother says it wasn't her husband)  So we never know.  I was hoping it was going to be grandfather Kincaid, a sort of father like son kind of thing.  Nope.  The matter was just dropped.  And what about Irving.  The man who was so ashamed how Bosch mother's case was handled is now the same kind of spin doctor he supposedly hated back in the day.  Plus, given how Bosch works cases, I surprised he put Bosch on this case at all.  Surely, Bosch, Rider, and Eggar aren't the ONLY three never sued by the attorney.  As far as L.A. ready to riot at the drop of dime, I find this highly unlikely.  Especially for the circumstance presented here.  Connelly swerves into a social political territory where he is ill equipped to handle and it's not pretty.  Plus, the ending flew wide into the unbelievable realm.  Bottom line-it's still a well written piece, but not classic Bosch (Black Ice excluded).litical territory where he is ill equipped to handle and it's not pretty.

B00005NVDF|4.0|I have a special fondness for this lightweight 1972 romantic comedy from the pen of Woody Allen. Directed surprisingly not by Allen but by the more studio-friendly Herbert Ross, it represents the noteworthy first pairing of Allen and Diane Keaton, and the combination of their unerring chemistry and Allen's clever, often hilarious script makes for great viewing after all these years. Allen plays his usual nebbish character, this time a film critic named Allan Felix, whose free-spirit wife leaves him for being a boring observer of life. He seeks solace from best friends Dick and Linda Christie, he a workaholic stockbroker and she a model. They set him up on a series of hysterically bad blind dates, which Allen plays out with physical abandon. Whether inadvertently flinging an album across the room or swinging spastically at a discotheque, he is a master of slapstick, a gift he has too rarely displayed since. Eventually, the inevitable happens when Linda and Allan fall in love.<br /><br />What makes the predictable premise unique is the way Allen celebrates classic movies, mainly Warner Brothers melodramas, and has the characters reenact famous scenes to move the story along. He even has the spirit of Humphrey Bogart act as his advisor when he faces romantic complications since Bogie always knew how to treat his women or so we all seem to recall. It's all deftly acted by an expert cast. Beyond Allen, Keaton shows the first signs of her unmatched comic prowess as Linda, though for the most part, she is called upon merely to be the conflicted leading lady (with fake eyelashes, no less). Tony Roberts, another Allen favorite, especially as the best friend, plays Dick in his typically sharp manner. Jerry Lacy does a reasonably good impersonation of Bogie, and the long missing Susan Anspach plays Allen's wife with spacey vitriol.<br /><br />While the film obviously lacks the emotional depth and improvisational style of Allen's later films (the obvious comparison being 1977's \\"Annie Hall\\" starring the same three leads), it still has a quaint charm to go with its romantic comedy conventionality. Its risk-averse nature is what makes this film an invaluable addition to Allen's filmography, as it shows how far he has come as a film auteur. Credit should also be given to Ross for bringing Allen's picture-perfect screenplay to life and also to cinematographer Owen Roizman for capturing the picturesque San Francisco locations while evoking classic Hollywood in key scenes. Unfortunately the DVD has no extras.arring the same three leads), it still has a quaint charm to go with its romantic comedy conventionality.

B000002WPI|5.0|The \\"36 Chambers\\" album is one of the few ever that completely revolutionized hip hop. I'm not going to say that it's the greatest ever, although it's easily in my top ten, but it's easily one of the most important, changing the face of the music genre for good. In 1993, hip hop was slowly drifting away from the Native Tongues, east coast mindset towards a gangstafied, lyrically simplistic style from the west coast. And then all of a sudden, \\"36 Chambers\\" arrived and produced something like hip hop had never seen before. 8 ultra talented MCs, simple yet intricate beats, metaphors, samples, hooks, something totally different. In fact, if it weren't for \\"36 Chambers\\", much of what is so prevalent in hip hop today would never have happened. There would be no posses the likes of G-Unit and Bad Boy, no skits in hip hop albums, no metaphoric raps the likes of Nas and AZ's mafioso or MF Doom's cartoon style, no movie samples, and no spinning piano beats like on here. Wu took over hip hop for the next ten years and beyond thanks to this album. \\"36 Chambers\\" is tough, funny, raw, amazing, entertaining, catchy, and head spinning all at the same time. Their style remains hard throughout, often metaphoric through kung-fu and such in describing a hard, distorted world of their hometown \\"Shaolin\\", aka Staten Island. The 8 MCs move in and out over RZAs production consistently, and it's easy to see why \\"36 Chambers\\" is regarded as such a classic album.<br /><br />The album leads off with \\"Bring Da Ruckus\\", an introductory type of track that lets everybody know who the Wu-Tang Clan is, hard raps from all, a silly intro, and a great song all around. \\"Shame on a N**ga\\" is a funny, catchy, loopy song led by Method Man and RZA. After the classic \\"Clan in da Front\\", with its looped beat, comes \\"7th Chamber\\", a track with a crazy intro skit followed by a great story. On \\"Can it All Be So Simple\\", the Clan drops some raw philosophy over a classic beat and hook. \\"Da Mystery of Chessboxin'\\" is one of those tracks that exhibits everything we love about Wu, with a crazy silly theme that you really have to listen to to know what they're talking about. Of course, \\"Wu Tang Clan Ain't Nothin' to F**k Wit\\" is on this album, one of the classic tracks of hip hop history. One of the hardest and craziest songs ever, it has a creepy hook and is a straight classic. This is followed by what many consider one of the greatest songs ever, \\"C.R.E.A.M.\\" It has a simple piano and bass beat, with a classic hook (\\"Get the money...dolla dolla bill y'all!\\") and storytelling lyric. \\"Method Man\\" is the first introspective track from the namesake that launched him to stardom, with a funny intro. The last three tracks, \\"Protect Ya Neck\\", \\"Tearz\\", and \\"7th Chamber Part II\\" are all classics in themselves that helped produce the legend that is \\"36 Chambers\\".<br /><br />\\"36 Chambers\\" is an album that is so strange and amazing that you can listen to it a million times and find some new beat, lyric, metaphor, or skit that you love each time.

B0000797IO|5.0|The Good Girl is one honest movie. Jennifer Aniston does a terrific job as a bored, depressed woman working her fanny off at the local retail rodeo. What i enjoy about this movie, is that it balances the drama/comedy to a T. Mike White wrote this sweet low-budget film and also appears as the security/relgious fanatic where Justine (Aniston) works. Check out the deleted scenes, i think all of them should had made the final cut.  Isn't there a good girl in all of us?
B000EQH2QK|4.0|from the opening chant of \\"Our Father\\" through to the reprise of \\"La Tortura\\", which was obviously added to boost sales (as it was the biggest Spanish-language song since Los Lobos' \\"La Bamba\\" in 1987), Shakira takes us on a musical journey of many different styles and does a great job. <br /> <br />Track by track: <br />How Do You Do - part of it sounds almost too Avril Lavigne/Kelly Clarkson like, but the addition of religious imagery and various languages makes it a good track. <br /> <br />Illegal - the made-for-AC-radio ballad includes some fierce guitar playing by Carlos Santana. Very pretty and almost sounds like something from the 1980's <br /> <br />Hips Don't Lie - just added to the album... Shakira successfully did what the likes of J. Lo and Mariah have always failed to do when collaborated, she made Wyclef Jean assimilate to HER style of music, as opposed to her doing a hip hop number.  A Latin-sounding booty-shaking fun track that is climbing the charts. <br /> <br />Animal City - one of the two most rocking tracks on the album, Shakira sings about celebrity and the way people change around her and become greedy.   <br /> <br />The Day And The Time - a beautiful track about hope and redemption <br /> <br />Dreams For Plans - meloncholy but beautiful, with just a hint of Portishead trip-hop to the mix <br /> <br />Hey You - this sounds almost like something No Doubt would do, very fun song that you will tap your toes and sing along to, a potential single IMO. <br /> <br />Your Embrace - one of the saddest songs on the record, but another pretty melodic ballad <br /> <br />Costume Makes The Clown - instead of being the cheated... Shakira is the unfaithful one and she's trying to apologize to her boyfriend, a rocker <br /> <br />Something - Shakira sings in French and gives us another ballad, albeit more alternative sounding than the other tracks <br /> <br />Timor - this is the dance track, sounds a bit like a Madonna track.  Shakira is singing about theoppressed and the government... even though she's singing about South America, I think Shakira's gay fanbase can definately adopt this track because it applies to them too... definately remix-worthy <br /> <br />La Tortura - this was one of the big hits last summer, added on the reissue to help boost sales (much like Hips Don't Lie), this is an alternate Spanglish mix with a little English thrown in <br /> <br />Not an award-worthy album and not a life-changer, but Shakira's album is still a very worthy listen and the second wind it's catching is well worth it and I hope this album holds on well.  There's a little something for everyone, there are a few too many ballads, but the slow songs all work and are some of the best tracks here.   Definate thumbs up.
0310250110|2.0|Nun habe ich leider auf Grund der vielen positiven Bewertungen diesen Film gekauft uns seit langem mal wieder richtig daneben gelegen. Die Erhaltung der Natur ist sicherlich richtig und wichtig, aber die Art des Hauptdarstellers den Zeigefinger zu erheben nervt gewaltig. Auch die ganze \\"unfreiwillige\\" (?) Komik und den netten Heimatfilm-Bilderchen von hüppelnden Hasen lässt einen lieber peinlich berührt abschalten. Diesen Film in einem Atemzug mit 2001 - ... zu nennen ist wahrlich lächerlich. Spätestens bei Joans Song war alles gelaufen. Netter Fehlkauf, mehr nicht und ich bin kein Knall-Bumm-Bang Fanatiker!
1594481717|4.0|I got this book as a present.  The person who gave it to me has an autistic son that attends a social skills group I run.  Given my own books on Asperger syndrome, he was interested in what I would make of the 'right-brain' arguments - since he hopes his son will get into IT in the longer run. It is a measure of the challenges these admirable parents cope with every day.<br /><br />Well, the first thing I told him was that I didn't think this book could help him shape his son's future. But he already knew that I reckon.  And the second thing I said was that the book was a little confused in its right brain thinking. In fact, if we all became right-brained it would probably be due to testosterone poisoning prenatally.  Our right hemisphere would be forced to take over some of the functions of the left hemisphere.  In other words, we would end up with pretty good visuospatial skills put pretty poor on communication nunaces.  Now the author doesn't say this but it running through the book is a recognition that automaton thinking devoid of human sentiment might be no bad thing. What the book does say however, and this confused me, is that we have to adjust our emotional make-up to accommodate R-thinking - and that means more or less getting rid of it or at least turning it into something unrecognisable to the Western household.<br /><br />The book makes all kind of claims for Right brain superiority, I won't get into these. Some are fanciful. However, it fails to deal with cultural (environmental) influences on how cognition and impicitly values are shaped.  This isn't a new flaw in this genre of book.  In fact it is pretty much the hallmark of the genre. I am old enough to remember the swamps of books that appeared in the early 80's recommending that we all become more Japanese to survive. Adopt Japanese culinary habits, modes of domestic activity, management styles and away we go. Now look at Japan. This book, unfortunately, is in the same vein.  It could have been entitled 'How to be more SE Asian than the SE Asians and be home for dinner'.  What the book is hobbled by is the assumption that learning from another culture entails an imperative to copy it.  It clearly doesn't and this kind of flawed socio-economic chutzpah infects the plausibility of many interesting conclusions.  The unpalatable fact is that none of us has a copy of tomorrow's newspaper.<br /><br />It is always nice to get a present and I was able to answer that father's questions, but if I hadn't got the book as a present I would probably have bought it anyway.  It is good to be provocative at times.be more SE Asian than the SE Asians and be home for dinner'.

1558908455|4.0|From Dusk to Dawn is a really fun movie. At first it starts out as one of those types of movies that barely holds my interest- George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are bank robbers on the run with a hostage. They shoot an Abilene Texas Ranger and a convenience store operator and end up at a sleazy hotel with their hostage where they run into Harvey Keitel, a preacher who has lost his faith upon the death of his wife and is taking his kids to a new life in their motor home. <br /> <br />At first things are very slow, but I should know better than to take a Quentin Tarantino film at face value. After a while you realize that the character played by Tarantino is two tacos short a platter and that George Clooney is one of those nice criminals who doesn't really want to hurt anybody. He tries to keep control of his brother, but that becomes increasingly difficult as Tarantino rapes and kills the bank hostage and then turns his sights on Keitel's teen age daughter (a strong performance by Juliette Lewis), who he believes is coming on to him. <br /> <br />Clooney decides that the best way to get over the border is to take over the motor home and hold Keitel and the two kids hostage. Once over the border, they stop at a trucker/biker strip joint where Clooney is supposed to meet a friend who will help him disappear in Mexico with his loot. <br /> <br />Suddenly things get really interesting and the action moves fast with lots of gore, goo and splattring. It turns out that the bar is actually a hang out for vampires who lure truckers and bikers in and then feast off of their blood. Clooney and company are trapped in the bar until sunrise. (Hence the title of the movie.) <br /> <br />There's lots of humor, some subtle and some in your face throughout this film and the character development and the relationship that develops between Keitel's family and Clooney is quite believable. There are also several marvelously funny moments with Cheech Marin in multiple roles. <br /> <br/>This film is not appropriate for kids below high school age because of strong language, sexual violence, graphic violence and nudity. But for everyone else, it's a fun romp with the vampires!
0375831002|5.0|An incredibly beautiful book!<br /><br />This is a story of a young German girl abandoned in the late 1930's and her ordeal of survival over the war years in Nazi Germany.<br /><br />The story is told by the personified spirit of Death; a sympathetic Death who is so worn out and so tired from the countless millenniums of collecting souls. A Death so discouraged  by man's inhumanity to man that when is sees something special in our heroine (the book thief) he decides to follow her story over the next few years.<br /><br />Deeply, deeply moving, insightful and, as is often the case in periods of dire circumstance, occasionally humorous. There were moments of profound revelation, moments of quiet discovery that took my breath away; moments when it was difficult not to stop reading and reflect on what one has just read.<br /><br />Reading this book reminded me somewhat of  \\"The Diary of Anne Franck\\" and although the stories were completely different there was a connection because of the era involved and the wonderful, emotional impact of the written word on the page.<br /><br />All in all, a beautiful, compelling story.  Highly recommended!  5 Stars,  more if  I could.<br /><br />P.S. surprisingly enough this book is found in the young adult section of  most book stores; this I feel is a inappropriate classification. This novel really is an adult book and should  be placed as such.
0393307050|3.0|I really had a difficulty settling on a star level for the whole series. The beginning of the first book in the series I found to be dry, focused more on relating the details of naval actions than on character development or plot; after the first few chapters the author seemed to find his fiction \\"sea-legs\\" and got into a rhythm with his story sufficient to carry me through the rest of the series.  The historical details were very interesting and well rendered but ultimately the characters, although given interesting character attributes never really came alive for me--they never became much more than their descriptions.  By the last few books I was a bit bored by the repetition.  O'Brian excels at setting the scene,and describing the action,(which was, I think, his primary motivation--to bring the historical ship's logs to life) but somehow never quite knew what to do with his ingeniously conceived characters--how to engage on an emotional level--other than making some of them abruptly and without much fuss disappear!
B00003CWTI|4.0|\\"Magnolia\\" is a movie of several stories and several personal connections.  It is a movie of urban legends, wrath, human sense and sensibilities.  Paul Thomas Anderson (\\"Punch Drunk Love,\\" \\"Boogie Nights\\" among others) both directed and wrote this eclectic film.  IMDB.com used the word mosaic in the description of the film and I agree fully with that word, but other than that, I don't know how you can provide a description of this film as it goes all over the place, yet it worked.  The film was very creative in using narration, the beginning history lesson on chance and during the film, chance sums up the film.  It was one of the most creative films made, packed with stars and I will guarantee you that you have never seen another film like it.  The film follows the trials of people, successful and outcasts and had some great performances and ended with religious overtones (the wrath part), maybe as a metaphor for how the people in the film lives developed and ended.  When watching, look for clues, especially numbers and other sequences that lead to the overall finale of the film.  The film was very good, but at 188 minutes, there was bound to be some low/slow points and that was the only downfall of the film.  The DVD is loaded with extras and the film is worthy of purchase as it is one of the most unique/creative movies that you will ever see.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|Continuing his unparalleled examination of human relationships, Wong Kar Wai returns to the character of Chow from In the Mood for Love, who had one chance for love, lost it, and has never gotten it back.  (While it is not necessary to have seen the former film to understand 2046, In the Mood for Love is such a wonderful film, that I recommend it to anyone who likes 2046).  Tony Leung gives a wonderful performance, clearly showing that he knows he should treat his women better than he does, but after giving his heart once in vain, he is not prepared to ever do so again.    2046 appears at first to be a year in the future, but is ultimately revealed to be the number of a hotel room where Chow had his one chance at happiness.  He finds a modicum of that innocence once again, this time in 2047, with a different woman (the daughter of the innkeeper, played by Wang Faye), the only one he treats with anything like the affection he had for the woman who had shared (platonically) 2046 with him earlier.  He writes a story for her, called 2047.  She says she likes it, but wishes it had a happier ending, something fans of Wong Kar Wai sometimes long for, but realize would not be true to that which goes on during his stories.       Aside from Tony Leung's masterful performance, 2046 is the perfect platform for the greatest Chinese actresses of today, demonstrating once again that no one can break your heart like Maggie Cheung, no one can make you happy like Wang Faye, no one can be a [...]like Zhang Zi Yi (albeit one that can still have her heart broken because she uses a hard exterior in a vain attempt to protect a brittle interior) and no one could ever be as beautiful as Gong Li.      Like most of Wong Kar Wai's movies, the ending can be called bittersweet at best.  He has only had one semi-happy ending, in Chungking Express, which also featured Tony Leung and Wang Faye (the only other time she has appeared in one of his movies).  This time, the only character who ends up happy is Wang Faye's, largely due to Tony Leung's intervention.  I don't know if that is a coincidence, or perhaps a comment on the fact that it isn't really possible to have anything but a happy ending when her luminous cheeks and eyes bless the screen.  For all of the other characters, however, we see much of the same unfulfilled longings and reconciliation to the alienation so many feel toward their families, friends and lovers.      Each of Wong Kar Wai's films has built up to this ultimate piece on what it means to be human and to know other humans.  You should really watch all of them, but even if you just watch this one, you will be the richer for it.
B000002IST|5.0|Peter Gabriel Genesis and Phil Collins Genesis...for the most part, they are two different animals...both GREAT STUFF! And honestly, both \\"leaders\\" also had some \\"duds\\". I believe the reason this great album...yes I said GREAT, has only a total 3.5 star rating is that the older die-hard Gabriel-era fans are disgruntled that their favorite band refused to remain in the past. We, as fans, have seen this played-out over and over again...our favorite bands try to branch out and evolve---sometimes it works e.g. Genesis, Santana,etc...sometimes it doesn't, e.g. Metallica, ZZ-Top, etc... So, with that said, I'm giving 'We Can't Dance' 5 stars to try and offset the undeserved current rating. Likewise, I wouldn't give 5 stars to an album that did not deserve it. This is a very good Genesis album that rates 5 in my mind, and not for the \\"hits\\"...though they are worthy. The real treasure with this album lies with the unknown songs. Driving the Last Spike, Fading Lights, Dreaming While You Sleep, Living Forever, etc...some of which contain some very cool \\"proggy\\" passages. Many other reviewers have rated the individual songs quite well, so I will simply say this album means a great deal to me and provokes many emotions within me (probably due to a \\"tricky\\" relationship I was going through when I first heard this CD). This is one of my favorite releases of the past 20 years, so beware of every review you read...you may miss out on something that might have become a treasured part of your collection/Life!  Jeff
B000E6ESL2|5.0|This film is extremely underrated. I loved this movie. The story, the scenes, the acting. I loved the trasitions between scenes. The movie had a great deal of emotion. Love it.
B000002TQV|4.0|I'm quite glad I chose this album to introduce me to Radiohead's music.  After owning it for a while now, I would say that it's a very good place for people who are new to the band to start.  It was on this 1995 release that Radiohead start to reinvent themselves from being a fairly unremarkable nineties alternative rock band, to becoming an ambitious art-rock band like no other. 'The Bends' does a fantastic job of treading the thin line between relatively accessible rock and the sweeping progressive rock of Radiohead's later music and the shift between the two genres is quite apparent. The songs here manage to be quite ambitious, and still palatable at the same time.  Some fantastic music to be found here.  Better still, there are hints of bigger things waiting in Radiohead's future.
B000001GYC|5.0|In contrast to many other musicians, Mendelssohn had an evident, fruitful and fortunate association with the visual arts. Keeping in mind his education was conceived as part of the Renascence man, so we should not ignore his classical-humanistic education, so that explains why his Symphonies maybe basically, considered such arresting visual landscapes: the Scottish, Italian and Reform would seem confirm it.<br /><br />The Songs without words conform ostensibly, a great stylistic and conceptual unity. It could not be other way, noticing the fact John Field was essentially the grandfather of the nocturnes for piano and Chopin the most expressive and intimate explorer of the human soul, Mendelssohn had all those variables in mind and decided to create a portrait album. As other artists as Liszt and Goethe the exerted fascination after being in Venice would work out as febrile inspiration. Every little page of this kaleidoscopic reflects different state anima; they are structured and interweaved similarly respect Robert Schumann with his Carnival or Childhood scenes; with profound lyric and evocative accent, destined to recreate the tourist memory. He achieved then to make a voluminous album of feelings but without that marked introspective mood of Frederic Chopin, for instance.<br /><br />Daniel Barenboim decided to record these ebb tide piano pieces with personal conviction and lyric imagination. The result was simply refulgent and deeply inspiring.
B000EGDC14|5.0|I have been a big fan of Goldfrapp when I discovered them back in 2000 on a now defunct music program on cable tv. The duo's first cd \\"Felt Mountain\\" was a sensuous mix of trip hop and ambient music. There was definite Shirley Bassey comparisons in Alison Goldfrapp's lush vocals. A couple of years later, the band followed up with the electro-clash sounding \\"Black Cherry\\" which was a drastic departure from the sensual, lush sounds of \\"Felt Mountain\\". Nevertheless \\"Black Cherry\\" was an excellent follow up. The songs were unquestionably catchy. 3-4 years later, Goldfrapp is back with the excellent \\"Supernature\\".<br /><br />I knew immediately \\"Supernature\\" was going to be a worthy follow up from the moment I heard the infectious synthesized melodies of \\"Ooh La La\\". The cd never loses its momentum. The music is irresistably catchy and fun to listen to. There are brief glimpses of \\"Felt Mountain\\" on \\"Supernature\\" like on the stunning ballad \\"Time Out From the World\\". It is really hard for me to pick out favorite songs on the cd. All the songs are just fun to listen to. Dance music hasn't sound this good in a long time.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, however I have made dozens of purchases based on helpful reviews here at Amazon. So when an album/artist affects me like this one, I feel its time for me to possibly try to help someone who may be indecisive about buying Testimony (as I originally was). I could simply talk for hours about this release and what it means to me, but I'll try to limit my biased opinion. Firstly, you must know that Neal Morse is a musical genuis (sorry, that statement may be biased). Secondly, he is equally effective as a solo artist as he was with Spock's Beard...his string of \\"spiritual\\" releases are all pure GOLD! As other reviewers have said, this is Neal's testimony of his journey from typical rocker guy to rocker guy for God...and it is a very moving experience (just listen to all the different emotions in his voice and lyrics). And as usual, Neal gets the top \\"cats\\" to accompany his musical vision. Please understand that this is a concept album of sorts that will probably take a few listens to get a \\"grip\\" on what Neal's trying to convey. After that, good luck getting some(or all) of these songs out of your head...this CD stayed in my car player for almost 3 months straight! Now, to try and describe this undescribable album. Obviously, anyone who's familiar with Neal's music will expect a wonderful fusion of prog and pop rock that 9 times out of 10 is simply delightful...and this release is certainly on par with that...you will hear odd-meters,orchestral granduer, re-acurring themes, some \\"over-the-top\\" playing and his unique vocals and lyrical phrasing. The album is broken into 5 parts that gradually tell the story and as with any \\"concept\\" album, is best digested by listening to the whole album uninterupted. As for the individual songs, they have been well covered by other reviewers so I would simply add that after a few spins of this disc, you probably won't want to skip many, if any, songs...YES, its that great! I will say however, that Part 5 isnot quite as great as the others in my opinion. One more thing to cover concerning this CD...will the non-believer be able to enjoy this? Yes,I truly believe so, Although I would guess it won't be nearly as poingnant. So, should you, the indecisive buyer, spend your hard-earned money on this release? You bet...don't even give it a second thought!Oh, and if you find yourself consumed with this one, go out and get his next two releases; 'One' and '?' and also the companion live DVD of Testimony which is STUNNING! Lastly, Neal, if your out there, thank you for \\"putting your heart on your sleeve\\" for all of us to share and also for giving us Believers an exciting and adventurous christian music form that is light-years ahead of the normal(mundane) christian music.

B00005JMFQ|4.0|It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.<br /><br />I love this film. Despite the clearly fantastic story lines, I like the characters, and the amazing A-list cast does a great job.<br /><br />\\"Love Actually\\" is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe I could list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader of my review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time.
B000068OCS|5.0|The slender visual touch, as well as the sublime contrast between nature and civilization, is expressed with austere elegance and powerful expressiveness. The imported term talks by itself \\"Life out of balance\\".<br /><br />For all those who have followed the wisdom spiritual lessons of Krishnamurti, Alan Kardec  or Fritzoj Kapra this film is a true helmet.<br /><br />At the special historic moment USA was living (it was the year of major unemployment index in North America, without include the political disappointments) , the movie found out an authentic legion of fervent followers.<br /><br /> A true icon by its own. A must-see.  .
B000E41MS6|3.0|I've revised my original review.    The general quality of the show, the writing, the acting and the plots have overwhelmed my criticisms of the alien effects and I'm totally on board with this new Doctor.    Long may he travel in that beautiful blue box.
B00004TFRF|1.0|Make a movie that's a piece of rubbish and put David Lynch's name on it, some will call it a work of genius. Even taking into account that the middle of the movie may be the desired recollection of the main character, Fred, or that the movie purposely mixes-up scenes, this movie, The Lost Highway, is still garbage. The first act with Fred as himself is boring! <br />  <br />David Lynch is a fine director, but his screenplays and ideas are just plain dumb. The avant garde crowd may think he's a genius but it takes the average Joe to point out the truth: most of David Lynch's movies are really stupid.
0345389409|5.0|Great book. Probably the best I've read in my entire life (no kidding). Everything about this book is awesome. You have to read it with an open mind though. If you're an atheist and dislike Catholicism, then this novel is probably not for you, I guess... <br /> <br />Anyway, I rate Anne Rice higher than John Milton and Dante Alighieri combined together. They got nothing on her (yes, I'm serious). <br /> <br />Oh and I loved the part where Veronica came into the picture. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favour and buy this book and read your brain out of your mind with it. I sure know I did.
B000EAT246|5.0|This is by far the best complment, so far, to this timeless adventure epic tale of a \\"whirly-bird\\" Red October. This DVD release could be topped only by a two disk superbit-dts-version with a platinum case.  <br />I have waited a long time to see this movie reproduced in the quality reminscent to that of which I first viewed it on the big screen.  <br />People that enjoy such movies as Top Gun and Stealth, won't mind reliving this earlier version of Man, Technology, and the \\"Great Blue Beyond!\\"
B000006IUQ|5.0|Did the grizzly get an oscar? He deserved one! This movie has some fantastic actors, such as Hopkins and Baldwin, but the bear stole the show. After their small plane crashes when an unexpected flock of geese comes their way, three men become the hunted when a grizzly bear being tracked by locals for being a 'man killer' picks up the crash survivor's trail. But the grizzly isn't the only danger. Hopkins has a pretty, model wife that seems to have become an obsession of her photographer (Alec Baldwin). Was the photographer plotting to kill the rich husband all along? Great scenery, fantastic action and plot twists that keep you on the edge.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
0380789035|5.0|I'll be the first to admit it - the first five times I tried reading this book, I couldn't get past the first chapter. It actually took me awhile before I actually sat down and read it. But when I finally did, I read it from cover to cover.<br /><br />This book is excellent. Some creative writers out there may argue that the sentences are short, but for the pacing and the main character (a man named Shadow), the short sentences are appropriate. The characters all have distinct personalities and all change over time. Even the minor characters stand out, from the lady at the gas station, to the other prisoners Shadow knows but never actually encounters in the book. (Except one, but that's a spoiler.)<br /><br />And the gods-they being a main part of this book-come from everywhere. They're not generic Greeco-Roman gods that everyone knows the name of; there's Czernobog and Anansi. There are even some modern day gods thrown in the mix.<br /><br />This book should also be noted for its rereading value. Each time you read it, you discover new things. Often, while reading it, I can be found exclaiming something like \\"Wow, I didn't know HE was in here!\\" or \\"Woah, I do not remember that happening at all.\\"<br /><br />Definitely one of my top five books of all time.
B0007RT9LW|4.0|I was contemplating on getting the Director's Cut of Gone in 60 Seconds until I looked at the time length.  Usualy a director's ct has more added to it, not taken away.  Believe it or not but the Original; released version of Gone in 60 is 118 minutes long where the Director's Cut release has a minute less footage.  For those that don't care it's not a big thing, but for movie goers, a minute off takes alot away...  Unless you're in it for the new extra features.
B00004CJ99|4.0|Based on the Alistair MacLean Cold war thriller, \\"Ice Station Zebra\\" is an above average military and espionage drama with significant submarine footage.<br /><br />An all male cast features Rock Hudson playing U.S. nuclear sub captain Commander Ferraday who has been ordered to transport secretive British spy David Jones played by the mellifluously tongued Patrick MacGoohan to Ice Station Zebra.  Ice Station Zebra a remote North Pole weather station has been transmitting an SOS signal.  Along the way the sub picks up imposing no nonsense Marine captain Jim Brown and friendly Russian spy Boris Vaslov played by Ernest Borgnine.<br /><br />They carefully navigate their way under the polar ice cap, surfacing by cracking through the icy crust three miles away from the weather station.  Creeping their way through a howling Arctic ice storm the U.S. team finally arrives at the fire decimated Ice Station Zebra.  Once there Hudson manages to learn that the reason for the mission is to procure a sensitive bit of film that was contained within a downed Russian satellite.  The film contains information containing the location of all U.S. missile installations and due to an aberrant orbit also reveals the location of Soviet missile locations.  As expected the Russians have also sent a team to the Pole to recover the film.  A stalemate ensues between the opposing forces in the remote and icy confines of the North Pole.<br /><br />The John Sturges directed flick while short on action and about 15-20 minutes too long does a decent job in chronicling the chess match between the two superpowers during this pivotal era of the Cold War.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I'm Not Dead is one of my favorite albums EVER!! I have been so disappointed with the music scene lately because there haven't been that many good albums put out. This is defintely my favorite album since The Emancipation of Mimi by Mariah Carey which I absolutey loved. <br /> <br />I admit, when I first heard \\"Stupid Girls\\", I thought it was just another song of the \\"washed-up Pink\\". But my curosity lead me to get this cd and I am SOO GLAD that I did. This album is completely deserving of 5 stars. My favorite tracks are \\"Runaway\\", \\"Long Way to Happy\\", \\"The One That Got Away\\", and \\"Dear Mr. President\\". This cd is AMAZING and I recommend it for everyone. I am in love with Pink now.  <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I finished watching this movie about an hour and a half ago and still find my eyes welling up with tears. Unable to visit the theatre, I eagerly awaited it's arrival on DVD. Being the center of so much controversy, I couldn't wait to see the movie and decide for myself. I am truly amazed. Heath Ledger pulled off his most amazing performance in this film. And Jake Gyllenhaal...wow...I admit I haven't seen many movies of his but I will now. Brokeback Mountain has to be one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen. The subject of the movie has made some of my family members a bit uncomfortable when I've expressed my desire to see it but I've never seen such a beautiful story. The emotion throughout the entire movie was so strong...I was moved to tears several times (and that does NOT often happen to me during movies) The conflicts, the passion, the obvious love the two felt for each other..so wonderfully portrayed by the actors made the movie all the more amazing. And the ending! Oh! I won't give anything away...but the shirt..that's what got me. Thinking about it even now, almost two hours later, tears. Such a beautiful movie. Everyone should see it. Tugs at the heart and gives some of the best performances I've seen in a very long time.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|i love the o.c. <br />and i love that with the dvd's,  you can watch the show commercial-free.   <br /> <br />the only bad thing about this set is that i spend too much time sitting in front of the tv because i can't quit watching!!
B00009L1UP|4.0|This is one of those cds you can play all the way through with out skipping tracks, aka, Perfect Highway Album.  I would consider every track to be more than decent.  The only problem I have with this album is that there are only a few stand out tracks such as \\"Silent Ludcidity, \\"Della Brown\\" and \\"Empire\\"  The rest are good but i rarely will go to a different track just to hear a different song.  This is just one of those albums you just have to listen to from start to finish
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I was not planning on buying Brokeback Mountain, but it was offered as part of a package deal with the new Walter Mercado DVD (which I knew my Girlfriend wanted), so I bought both.  Being a typical Latin Macho Guy, I had pre-conceived notions as it relates to this film, but it turned out to be a well done movie.
B000BEZPQE|2.0|You know, it is interesting that many good hardcore bands like Demon Hunter get outcasted and rejected from mainstream metal because of their faith; while other groups with opposing religous ideas get away with singing about it.  To me, that shows who is really hardcore.   <br />Slipknot sings about the same old religous views that many of the people in this country believe, yet they are not lumped into the religous music section next to Amy Grant.  Why is that?   <br /> <br />Well, I'm not joining your religion, it seems as though you have enough followers and the same religous views as Brittany Spears.
6304493681|5.0|Let me start out this review by saying that this anime should be a martar for other anime to follow because it is an amazing anime. The plot is basically a cybernetic government agent, Major Motoko Kusanagi, who goes and tries to catch a computer virus called \\"The Puppet Master\\". From start to finish this movie is amazing with great animation and storyline. I think almost everybody should be able to see it as long as they are mature enough. There is a lot of violence and some language. Also, some slight nudity, but very non-sexual. Overall, I think this is one of the best anime ever.
B000EGCIU0|5.0|this is the follow up of 2001's \\"Missundaztood\\"  cuz \\"try this\\" was a [...]...but this album its so hot....best tracks: Leave me Alone (Im lonely)...my favorite so far.., Who Knew, Dear Mr. President, U +Ur hand. Best album of this first quarter of the year.
1400062071|5.0|Describing a whole world in a few words, as someone said, and such a resonating world - this is what great literature is made of. <br /> <br />I couldn't put this book down.  This is a writer with a sure grasp of the relationships between men and women, our foolish and guileless hopes and disappointments, how the landscape of our lives is reflected by everything around us. Every word in this book is true, even though it is fiction.   <br /> <br />The ending of the book doesn't disappoint, either.  Truly a marvelous work that will live in my mind for quite awhile.   <br /> <br />I think it deserves 6 stars. <br /> <br />
B000069HZP|3.0|\\"The Game\\" starts out interestingly enough: Michael Douglas plays a Nicholas Van Orton, wealthy San Francisco investment banker who also happens to be a selfish control freak. His burnout brother, Conrad (Sean Penn), buys Nicholas a part in \\"the game,\\" which is a mysterious personalized \\"experience\\" developed by a company called Consumer Recreation Services. Nicholas suddenly finds himself immersed in a series of unexplainable events that become increasingly dangerous and manage to shatter the secure, controlled environment that he has built for himself.<br /><br />This film does an excellent job of illustrating what happens when a person's world literally comes crashing down around them. Douglas does an amazing job of showing how \\"the game\\" takes over his character's entire life and transforms a once powerful, conniving man into someone who is completely overwhelmed with sheer terror. Unfortunately, the movie drags a lot (especially in the beginning) and the ending leaves a lot to be desired. The whole concept of \\"the game\\" is so ridiculously absurd...I think the film could have gone in several different directions, and I was ultimately disappointed with the way things turned out.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Game\\" boasts excellent performances by Douglas and the rest of supporting cast. There are some great suspenseful moments in the film, but the whole concept of the story is too ridiculous (even for a movie) and the ending is so anticlimactic that I can't really claim to have enjoyed it all that much.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|\\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is one of the few albums- The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\", The Beastie Boys' \\"Check Your Head\\", The Velvet Underground's self-titled third album, Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\"- that are already viewed as a classic by some of the eminent critical voices of our time yet deserve still more acclaim. It transcends the minimal constraint that prevented the group's previous two albums from reaching such a phenomenal height- namely, that both stood in the shadows of the Beatles' at times only minimally superior work- to become a definitive \\"great album.\\" Yes, the \\"Bye-Bye Love\\" cover is insignificant, but it is also more than competent. Yes, \\"Baby Driver\\" is a throwaway, but it's irrepressible, and quite superior to The Who's similar \\"Goin' Mobile.\\" But neither of those songs undermines the record's overall tone and texture, nor do they dilute the strength of its unbelievably moving title track. \\"The Boxer\\" and \\"So Long Frank Lloyd Wright\\" are also quite beautiful, and the latter possesses an intoxicatingly rhythmic bridge that often gets overlooked by listeners in favor of the easier pleasures of the album's two more well-known ballads. \\"The Only Living Boy in New York\\" is breathtaking and grand, both a ballad and an anthem; of all the songs S&G recorded, it's the nearest in style and scope to \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" though \\"America\\" might be said to hold this title as well. \\"Cecilia,\\" on the other hand, is possibly the catchiest song of the entire 1970's. The instrumentation throughout \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is impeccable; the writing is understated and evocative- in its concision, it states as much as Dylan often could in twice its length; and both vocalists are represented at their peak here. Simon would never top his work here, though he came close on his underrated first solo record, and Garfunkel would record a few good albums and make a few half-hearted attempts to become a movie star before sliding into relative obscurity. \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is the greatest achievement of two of the sixties'-and all-times'- greatest pop artists, and deserves every plaudit it has been and will ever be served.
6303201954|5.0|This is often a criticized entry along with \\"The Final Frontier.\\" I agree with Roger Ebert. This is a very cerebral, enjoyable film with built-in \\"expectations\\" from a television show cast. They almost don't mix but if you sit back, relax and open your mind they do come together splendidly. I prefer the theatrical cut from late 1979. That is why I own the widescreen VHS version. It is the only way to see the film in its theatrical cut. The pan & scan VHS and DVD are different cuts. One of the best themes ever written musically for an opening.
B0009HKH6Q|4.0|The Original and the best-not much to say read the suppliers review and you won't be disappointed.
B000008H4E|5.0|This is a great collaboration between two of my very favorite musicians, a truly miraculous and deep set of songs, one of four excellent discs by Jon and Vangelis. After a rousing introduction, quite electric and spacy, during &#34;Curious Electric,&#34; &#34;Each and Everyday&#34; is a stately and welcome ballad. Jon's lyrics are evocative of innocent, caring times, and are reflected beautifully in the lovely melodies of Vangelis. &#34;Bird Song&#34; is an innocent march, which builds in majesty and tempo. Jon harmonizes with himself to gorgeous effect, a song about the wonder of the first embrace. &#34;There's a road that takes me back,&#34; begins the beautiful &#34;I Hear You Now.&#34; &#34;In the midst of all creation, there's a road for you and me.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The Road&#34; begins with a chant, and tympani and bells introduce a driving, indeed manic piece. This fades into a lush, unabashedly romantic aria, for want of a better word, accompanied by shimmering atmospherics.<br /><br /> &#34;Far Away in Baagad&#34; begins in a playful way, and seems truly possessed of a Middle East flavor. In &#34;Love Is&#34;, the depth of emotional expression reaches its deepest point on this record. The words are very moving: &#34;Although the future is so uncertain, take heart my good friend, your time is waiting, no thoughts of sadness. Of all the feelings, there's one that matters, the gift of loving, the gift of love is calling you. Oh heart of mine, be true! I know we're ready, like ships a-sailing, let all nights seem like this, forever I could hold you. Come to me. There we find true love.&#34;<br /><br />A whimsical introduction on the highest notes of the keyboard lead into another deeply thoughtful and inspiring song, &#34;One More Time&#34;. &#34;Should have known that things were getting out of hand, when you told me that you'd gone and left your father's ways behind, and you thought that you couldn't understand him and he didn't really answer the dreams that you planned.&#34; Well, I sure remember when I realized that about my father, and this song gets to me every time, and should for anyone who is in touch with their feelings about their dad.<br /><br />The enjoyable &#34;Thunder&#34; is a short A-B-A piece, soft-heavy-soft, that leads to a long final number. A reverberant introduction leads to lovely ballad, followed by a short section with a rousing rock beat. Jon asks the musical question, &#34;Are we everything, a play within a play?&#34; and this great journey of the soul spins off into a reverberant, melodic space.<br /><br />This is obvlously a journy of the soul worth taking.I sure remember when I realized that about my father, and this song gets to me every time, and should for anyone who is in touch with their feelings about their dad.  The enjoyable &#34;Thunder&#34; is a short A-B-A piece, soft-heavy-soft, that leads to a long final number.

0790740443|5.0|The spiritual opposite of \\"Star Wars III - Revenge of the Sith.\\" Transcends sci-fi genre with a focused look at the essence of warriorhood, and what is sacrificed to create a \\"perfect killer.\\"  The evolution of the Kurt Russell character is a touching transformation from a souless Storm Trooper to a true citizen soldier in the ideal American tradition. But there's nothing textbook preachy about it.  A lot of visual flash and pizzaz, considerable tension, and unpredictable twists because things could easily go either way, including the ending.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|When I heard (or read) that Peter Jackson was going to remake King Kong, I was excited to see it, mainly because special effects have advanced so much since the 1933 original film and the 1976 remake. I knew Jackson's work in the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy was spectacular, so I figured that would translate well into King Kong. I was not disappointed one bit. The special effects were amazing, as I knew they would be. What I did not expect, and quite frankly, what no one expected, was the incredibly emotional and heartbreaking aspects of the film. I rarely shed tears at a movie, but this one had me shedding quite a few. I have never seen a more moving film than King Kong. The reason why is because 2005's Kong is not a \\"monster,\\" as he has been portrayed in the past. He is a real gorilla in this film (albiet 25 feet tall), and that is the difference. When you see him suffer, you're watching a majestic animal suffer, not a \\"horrific beast.\\" The relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow is a friendship, not a \\"love/lust\\" interest. You realize Kong is very lonely, the last of his kind, and in Darrow, he has finally found a friend, one that he is willing to give his life to protect. That's what makes his ultimate demise so heartwrenching in this film.  <br />Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece. Yes, the special effects and action sequences are stunning, but what is more stunning is the emotional impact of this monumental film. If there's one thing I wish Jackson had changed from the original film in his new version, it was the tragic ending-I just wish Kong would've lived. Ultimately, however, I think this film is unquestionably the greatest remake ever, and one of the best films I've ever seen.
B000050FEN|4.0|Excellent thriller, dark and with a surprising end. Great performances of Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow and especially of the extraordinary Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. Simply brilliants. Probably the David Fincher's best movie.
B00000IN5G|5.0|I'm not going to write a huge review, but just backin up what everyone has said. How anyone could rate this below 4 stars is beyond me. Every single instrument is performed brilliant, especially during the keyboard/guitar solos. The neo-classical sound usually found in power/progressive metal music makes its way into this fabulous melodic death metal album. The vocals are good, and although they are high-pitched, fit it well with the music. The blast beats are well crafted, the keyboards are awesome, the bass is rich and deep, and the dual-guitar work is amazing. Although all the songs are amazing, the 'great' songs would have to be Bed of Razors, Downfall (just listen to the keyboard work!), Warheart and Silent Night, Bodom Night. Other good songs are Black Widow, Towards Dead End... oh forget it, the whole album is good!
B0000A98ZP|4.0|One of the John Hughes's most admired comedies. I admit that I did not see it in the eighties and now turns into a real surprise. Funny and cinical, in spite of the stereotypes it is a very interesting movie.
B000BCE918|5.0|This is definitely a set worth purchasing. All three movies are great, and what I've seen of the special features are nice too. The packaging is eye catching, although slightly annoying. There's nothing to keep the doors on the front shut, and the box was too tall to fit in my DVD rack. It's still nothing to get really concerned over, the set is a great deal and definitely worth the money.
B000000H66|5.0|I wish I had gotten into metal before you died, then I may have been able to donate something to this legend. His death is as painful as any death in the rock/metal community (Dimebag,Staley,Burton,Samuelson,etc.). These guys are the creators of death metal. Chuck Schuliner's vocals are harsh, as expected. His guitar playing is complex and powerful. It's sad that he met his end like this. Why does it never happen to people like Fred Durst or Feminem? Yet the great legends are the ones who always die. It's just not fair!
B000E1MXSW|5.0|You do not have to be Catholic to appreciate the towering schievement that \\"The Nun's Story\\" is.  This is an example of what Hollywood used to do very well in portaying an intimate character study against an epic backdrop.  Audrey Hepburn is simply tremendous as Sister Luke, a woman torn between her devotion to God and service to humanity.  Peter Finch matches her as the world-weary humanistic doctor.  As a Catholic and educated by nuns this film gave me an appreciation for the sacrifices these woman make to better serve Jesus Christ and humanity.  It's surprising that a film of this magnitude took so long to make it to DVD.tatsächlich funktioniert. Aber Spielspaß ist auf jeden Fall garantiert. Vorsicht: Suchtgefahrt!!!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It's not about being gay..or a gay movie...it's all about love....I was amazed by this great story. As a person who really disregarded homosexual....this movie has changed my attitudes toward the homosexual commununity... this movie is A+ and should have won the Best Picutre Award, instead of CRASH.
B00004XQP4|4.0|As many people have noted Green Day took another step in another direction with this album, and in my opinion it's one of their best (with their best being Nimrod) and far, far better than American Idiot (which I feel is their worst album.) Yes, it's mature, but not \\"look at how clever we can be\\" more just another step forwards in the direction hinted by Nimrod. While Nimrod still had straight-up rockers and even ska and metal, Warning! follows a more poppy sound, but in the best way possible! The old Green Day sound can still be found in Minority but when they decide not to retrace themselves, they can really shine. The stand out tracks are Warning, Church On Sunday, Castaway, Jackass, WAiting and Macy's Day Parade, the latter being possibly the best song Green Day have recorded. For those of you slagging off American Idiot, have a listen to this, Nimrod and Dookie, it should change your mind.
B0000508U6|4.0|Having listened to both this album and X&Y, overall, this is the better album. X&Y contains my all time favorite Coldplay song, Speed of Sound. But that's basically the only song on that album I could really get into. This album, for some reason, was different. The tracks just seemed to flow more. Shiver, Yellow, and High Speed were three of the best, and Everything's Not Lost was a great way to close the album, although I wonder why the last two minutes were quite necessary, I thought it detracted from the song. Overall, though, this is better than X&Y by far.
B000002J1U|5.0|There is no question that their previous albums were full of energy and set our expectations for more of the same. Well, I found that this album was the richest of their creations. \\"That's the way\\" is my personal favorite with it's melodic guitar runs & Plant's vocals weaving their way through Page's strumming conclusion. \\"Immigrant Song\\" , \\" Celebration Day\\"& \\"Out on the Tiles\\" with it's driving, pulsing sounds connect to their previous work. \\"Bron-Y-aur Stomp\\" &  \\"Gallow's Pole\\" bring a diferent folksy tone to their music.  \\"Since I've been loving You\\" is a classic blues rendition that touches the plight of the under-appreciated working man with Page's vocals driving through Page's winding guitar runs. This album definitely stands the test of time.
B000929AJQ|5.0|First off I do not want to write like 100 pages of why NIN(Trent Reznor)is a Genius, because I can, but a quick review on this album that I urge everybody who has given this album negative reviews to LISTEN TO IT AGAIN. I've been a NIN fan since the beginning and each album is different and unique in it's own way. There is no possible way that I can put one album above another because they are ALL MASTERPEICES, and WITH TEETH is no exception. If you don't like it at first just listen to it again with an open mind and I think that you will be able to at least give Reznor some credit. I'm all about people having their OWN opinions but at least give things a REAL try. Even though I was a diehard NIN fan I must admit that at first I was maybe a little disappointed, but now I can truly say that this is as good as anything he has ever done. So If you don't like it, that is fine, and if you do like it then all the better. I loved Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, and The Downward Spiral the first time I heard them. I think what causes the Initial let down with The Fragile, and With Teeth is completely based on Impossible Expectations and Anticipation due to the very long layoffs between the albums. But after awhile I think that they have either met or exceeded the expectaions, which is AMAZING, because they were so big to begin with. I love, and will support anything and everything that Reznor does whether it is for himself, fans, or both. ALL I CAN SAY IS....A.WITH..A.TEETH.A.
0446604844|2.0|Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get \\"done in\\" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|First off, this is a fine performance of the Canadian rock trio on their first tour in many years. As well, you get just about every Rush song you'd ever want in a live setting. BUT, what was guitarist Alex Lifeson thinking (or hearing) when he helped mix this thing? Singer/bassist Geddy Lee's vocals are so deeply buried that I found myself straining to hear them on almost every song. After awhile, this became so frustrating I stopped listening to the album and have traded it in at a used record store. For a far, far better listening experience, pick up the R30 DVD/CD concert package celebrating the band's 30-year anniversary.
B000DZIGDU|2.0|I didn't read the book, just watch the DVD, and it leaves some questions: <br />do the Marines Crops live in the bay, even the permament party? <br />does Fergus listen to their leader or follow the common sense??? he made open flame on the Humvee which has boxes of ammo!!! <br />one of the supporting character, Alan Troy (Swoff's battle buddy), nobody knows why he dies <br />I don't know did Fowler ever go to cultral awareness class? he stared at an Arab lady and make funny face, this is rude against Arabs <br />when the group of 6 marched on the desert, the Arab guy told their camels got shot, but they look OK through the screen <br />this movie sounds degrading Marine Crops, the Kuwait scene is FALSE (currently I am here for OIF), don't ever think every desert is the same, wrong! <br />personally I don't recommend the movie, except you're Jake Gylanhaal fans
0142405787|4.0|I think the fifth book of the Alex Rider series, Scorpia, was great. It had a lot of action. In this book Alex really is trying to figure out which place he is loyal to, but once he finds out that at least 1 million school children will be killed he helps the good guys, MI6. At the end of this book I was sure this would be the last, because of an incident, but the good news is that you can buy the next book on Amazon, the next book is called Ark Angel! I think that if you like fast-paced action you should definitely read these books!
0312995423|3.0|For me, the biggest problem with this novel is I can not sympathize with the good guys. The protagonist, Susan, is basically a selfish, arrogant and stupid woman, though the author tries to say the opposite. If you are against the bad guys depicted in the movie Enemy of the State, you are going to dislike her.  <br />Her boy friend David is no better, he used money to change clothes with a man to avoid being a target of a killer, knowing pretty well that he put the  poor innocent man in life danger. The guy did get killed and what he did wrong was going to church and sitting beside Susan's boy friend.    <br />The plot and the rationale behind is questionable(if not ridiculous). I was able to figure out the password before all the NSA experts could (I don't think I could be that smart). <br />Having said all of that, I admit the book is a page-turner. I didn't get bored, just can not root for the heroes depicted in this book.
B000E6GBV2|5.0|Thanks for a incredible beautifull and mindblowing record. It?s a long long time ago I have had such a fine surprise regarding good blistering rock (For me kind of Indie, kind of Emo) - not since The Feelies - The Pixies - olign. Give it a listen, when you have heard it 3-4 times it hits (It did for me) and I?m looking forward to follow this Bands music. <br />All the best <br />Krydolf <br />
B000E97Y6K|5.0|King Kong was great in so many levels I was wanting to watch more and more. the only downfall this movie May have had was the fact it was a 3 hour epic. Some people get ADD ish and cant stay that long I stayed the whole 3 hours and was rivited, there were great perfomances from Jack Black Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts all in one film. I was mesmerized at what Peter Jackson can really create when his mind is set on something. I was specualate on the whole remake of King Kong Idea and never watched it in theatres while it was out I opted to go watch Chronicles of Narnia..(also good...different review) however when I got the DVD and ousted the 28 dollars for the Special edition DVD, the movie rocked me with greatness, They just film and perform everything to beyond standards, its quite phenomenal so if you got the time for a 3 hour epic this is what you want to use your time for.
0679422714|1.0|I don't have the habbit of writing book reviews and, in fact, have never written one before.  But I could not help myself with this one.  I am only halfway through this book and just cannot stand to continue, feeling it is utterly waste of my time.  I believe the lead author, June Chang, had one purpose in mind in writing this book, that is to smear and degrade Mao Tse-tung (for whom I have absolutely no sympathy).  And she did it as in bad gossipping tales and without the fundamental repect to hisory and logic.  This is what turns me off the most and prompted me writing this review.      Despite of its claim of telling \\"history\\", I found the book offering very little in terms of real history.  In fact, it only tried to portray an evil man (or possibly the evilest man known to mankind) largely by distorting facts, mismatching events, or simply making up things on her own.  I came from China and belong to the same generation as her.  So I have heard and read about some of the events she referenced in the book.  I was astonished and appalled by how they were stretched and used against Mao in this book, regardless of what one's view is toward him or his legacy (I happen to be not a big fan of his).  In fact, to any logical mind (even if you don't know anything about this period of Chinese history), this book is full of self-contradiction and logical errors.  How could the Mao-lead Reds commit so many purges, cleansings and atrocities against the populations everywhere they went and yet, their territories kept growing and more people joining their army?  How could Mao be disliked or even hated by most of his peers and colleagues and yet, he kept ascending the party leadership ladder  and eventually to the thrown?  The book attributed the Nationalist failure in Mainland China to the \\"pre-arranged moles\\" planted by the Communist Party in its very early and vulnerable years.  Some of them ended up at the very top of Nationalist Army, like Hu Tsung-nan, who was equivalent to the top general of a major US command today.  The book stated after twenty some years as a \\"sleeper\\", Hu would cut his own troops up and fed them \\"piece meal\\" to the Reds to be annihilated.  He would do it systematically, and against repeated protests from his subordinates, until his forces were totally defeated.  How believable is that?  She discribed the Reds exerting terror to the local population while facing the overwhelmingly stronger Nationalist Army in early 1948, to such an extent that \\"at least some 16 million people were on the receiving end of some degree of physical abuse and humiliation.  Hundreds of thousands, possibly as many as a million, were killed or driven to suicide.\\"  Yet in some mysterious way, Mao won the spectacular victory of the well-known Hua-Hai campaign.  Her conclusion: \\"this genealized terror in Shandong that built the foundation for the Huai-Hai victory.\\"  How real is that?  In her account of \\"history\\", Chiang Kai-shek was a kind-hearted man who tolerated the men who betrayed him and brought his downfall in Mainland China.  Even the Japanese did not seem so bad.  In fact, it was Chiang's general Zhang Zhizhong who in 1937 forced Japan into all out war with China, by attacking them first.  This was probably the most ridiculous claim I've ever heard.  Absurdity beyond measure!    It is clear that the authors tried to woo the readers with sensational tales, especially those in the west who don't know much about China.  They would repeatedly employ a technique of putting shocking words, such as \\"massive arrests, massive kills\\", in quotes in the same context of someone (like Mao) saying something to give one the impression that he actually said or demand it.  There were so many quoted single words or phrases (not full sentences) intermingled with authors' own accounts or statements throughout the book, that it is hard to tell which is a quote and which is not, or what is true and what is not.  Some were just outright unbelievable.  They went so far as to tell stories that defied the physical ability of human being.  Example: \\"She had just had a baby and her milk was dripping.

There were just countless examples like this and, soon enough, you start to lose confidence on the next paragraph or story and question the foundation of the whole book.    I brought two of her books together, this book and her famed Wild Swans.  Now I don't think I would have any interest in opening up the other book.  I think she has done wonders in discrediting herself as a serious writer, let alone historian.  I have read a few history books, in both western and Chinese cultures.  I have never seen anyone stretching truth and distorting history the way she did it in this book, even to convict a known tyrant.

0312979479|5.0|This classic Who-Done-It by Agatha Christie reads as well today as when it was first appeared in 1939.  Ten different persons are invited to spend a weekend on remote Indian Island, guests of a mysterious host.  At dinner on the first evening a recording is played that accuses each guest of serious wrongdoing.  Soon Anthony Marston drops dead from poisoned wine.  By morning, another guest lies dead.  The boat from the mainland won't be returning for days, so the surviving guests are in a fix and rightly terrified.  A search of the island proves that nobody else is on the island - but which guest is the culprit?  \\"We must be very careful,\\" warns one guest, but still their numbers decline.  The author reveals more about the surviving individuals as their numbers dwindle; their thoughts, desperation, and guilt for which they were accused.  Christie gives a couple clues, but only tiny ones.  Will the killer be discovered in time?  Will anybody survive?  Don't peak at the ending - this classic is worth your best effort.<br /><br />Agatha Christie (1890-1976) was a mystery-writing legend, and at this writing she's sold more books worldwide than anybody other than Shakespeare. This gripping mystery is one her best - and some say she was the best.

B0007P3582|1.0|Thanks to people like Curtis \\"I been shot 9 times\\" Jackson, being a violent, sadistic, drug pushing, woman beating, homophobic, criminal sociopath is now the premiere way to proceed through life.  The mere fact that a person like him has such an influence over a young generation is painfully disturbing.  <br /> <br />Kiddies, let's face the simple facts here. 50 Cent is a perfect example of the cult of celebrity. His music is played everywhere. He has his own clothing line. He has his own \\"gang\\" (sorry, I couldn't keep a straight face saying that). He's a household name due to some ingenious PR campaigns which portray him as some sort of poor vagrant who was dealt a few misfortunes in life and now deserves all the accolades afforded unto him. I don't buy it for a second. <br /> <br />Fiddy is as phony as the BS tales he spews. He was shot AT 9 times, but only 3 bullets connected. Why was he shot? Who knows: maybe he actually shot AT someone first and the other gangster fired in retaliation? Or perhaps he was pushing drugs on children in some other criminal's turf? Shyne calling him a joke was probably the most accurate statement ever said about 50 Cent. He cherishes the gang life so much that he now owns several mansions and drives in a bullet proof car, surrounded by sycophants, PR consultants, and lawyers. Maybe he should go back to the wonderful life of getting shot and living on the street with other drug-addicted \\"homies\\", you know, kind of like in the songs he sings? Who am I kidding, 50 Cent is the biggest Uncle Tom around.  <br /> <br />It's sad indeed that this is the kind of person who kids look up to, rather than someone like their parents, who probably work their butts off earning a decent living so their ungrateful children could have the kind of future the parents never had. If they spent even a single day living the disgraceful lifestyle espoused in these kinds of songs, they would run back crying to their middle-class suburban home.

Every aspect of each song is so meticulously created; every single lick and riff creatively produced in a delicious blend of metal and classical is magnificently put together in this amazing musical achievement. Loved it. My favorite tracks include \\"Icarus' Dream Suite Opus 4\\", \\"Black Star\\" and of course \\"Far Beyond the Sun\\". Buy it!

0812550757|2.0|This book could have been a lot better, but for a few things. <br /> <br />First, the understanding of Orson Scott Card of Catholicism is, quite frankly, obnoxious. In his Introduction, he states that he wanted Novinha to have several children, so it would be clear that was not why she was separated from society. I would point out that Catholics and Mormons say identical things about each other's religion in this aspect, and that this is incredibly disrespectful. Even as a non-Catholic, I found this offensive. <br /> <br />Second, his constant usage of Portuguese in the book was distracting and annoying. I know that he did his mission in Brazil, but that is no excuse. Frankly, I find his idea that Portuguese is a language that is used on other planets much, MUCH less probable than the faster than light communication and the dramatic misunderstanding of the nature of biology that he employs here. <br /> <br />Third, the biology is SO bad. I can't even use proper words to describe how incredibly implausible this is. When I read it, I just set the book down for a few minutes and walked away. Biology doesn't work that way. Not on Earth. Not on any planet. Period. <br /> <br />Fourth, the characterizations in the book are more like caricatures. While many people think that the characters herein undergo some kind of significant development, the characterization here is actually much, MUCH worse than in Ender's Game.  <br /> <br />Quite simply, this book was not a good successor to the goodness that was Ender's Game.  <br /> <br />If you absolutely drool over OSC's work, go ahead and pick this up. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother. It really isn't as good as the reviews make it out to be. The \\"secrets\\" are fairly transparent, the character development is shallow (at best), and the languages used are irritating.  <br /> <br />Oh, yeah, as a parting shot. The \\"piggies\\" should have been referred to as pequeninos throughout the story. I understand the value of referring to them as\\"piggies\\" for the purpose of degrading them and making them seem like less than ramen, etc. Whatever. Regardless, it was irritating, and the mischaracterization solely serves to make it more difficult to imagine them (physically) as they are described. <br /> <br />Harkius
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I was often recommended Oldboy by loads of people but kept putting it off for some reason. Well, I'm glad I just decided to go 'what the hell' because it IS actually really, really good.<br /><br />Even though the plot has been outlined a zillion times in other reviews, I will simply say that some seemingly random dude is plucked from the streets, imprisoned in a shoddy apartment for 15 years and let loose with a wallet full of money and a cell phone. He has 5 days to find the man who imprisoned him and why.<br /><br />An absorbing set-up and the clues as he slowly finds them and slowly puts them together make for a brilliant mystery movie with a wicked dark sense of humor. The plot has layers and layers of mystery and our hapless hero wades through thick twists and turns, always keeping us on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />There are some brilliant fight scenes and some truly bizarre moments, such as a live octopus being eaten whole. But what really floored me was the ending. I won't tell you a tiny little bit of it. But...wow! As is the case with EVERY SINGLE Asian MOVIE, Oldboy is currently being remade by Hollywood. Because anything that the Asians can do, Hollywood can apparently do better. In my opinion this film really doesn't need a remake as this version is strong enough to appeal to the whole world.<br /><br />Too bad most of the planet are philistines who would rather 'watch' a film than 'read' it. A complaint I hear often enough. If your impression of Asian films is they are all shoddy and not very modern looking then, in the case of Oldboy, you are very much mistaken.<br /><br />Among the many strong points of the movie are the faultless editing and stunning photography. Oldboy is the slickest movie I have seen in a good while and can easily out-gloss anything by Michael Bay.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and check this movie out. If you don't love it then you truly have no business watching films at all. I'll save you time and tell you outright that if you like stuff like Crapper By The Dozen 2 and Miss Congenatiliality 2 then is best you just stick to stuff like that. At the risk of sounding like a pretentious ass, leave the more important films to the brainiacs.<br /><br />The DVD is in immaculate 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen with a brilliant Dolby/DTS 6.1 sound design!utright that if you like stuff like Crapper By The Dozen 2 and Miss Congenatiliality 2 then is best you just stick to stuff like that.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's hard to add anything significant to the good things already said about this series. Indeed, has anybody ever said anything that WASN'T complimentary? So why did it not survive a handful of episodes? Is there, it makes me wonder, a kind of entertainment (story-telling or whatever it is we're talking about) that will be universally appreciated and liked (loved even, occasionaing amazing devotion and appreciation) by those who receive (read, watch, listen to) it, but which nonetheless doesn't actually make it to the 'blockbuster' or 'raging success' stage? <br /> <br />How can this be? What kinds of demographics are we talking about?  Who are the people that watched and almost invariably came to love Firefly, and the follow-up movie, Serenity? It appears, from what I've observed, that they come from every walk of life and, if my experience is anything to go by, from a wide spectrum of philosophies and political persuasions, as well as what one might call 'artistic' inclinations and/or predilections. <br /> <br />What does that tell us? I wish I knew. I'm sure it means something; if only we could figure out what. Has it got to do with those kick-ass ladies? (See my 'Serenity' review.) Or is it just the focus on 'character' rather than convoluted plot? Is it because those characters are shown and revealed by what they DO, rather than what they DID or how they came to be where they are. Or does it just tell us that there is an audience truly interested in 'character', without wanting it either in soap-opera, obscure 'concept' drama, or arty-farty high-brow DAMNs ('Deep And Meaningful Nothings')? <br /> <br />I'm just speculating here. Someone might use it as a subject for a Ph.D. thesis. Stranger things have happened. <br /> <br />So, again, why did the series tank? The world sometimes appears to make no sense at all... <br /> <br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I've seen many films in my time and been moved by many. I and a great number of people I know--churchgoers, executives, professionals, garage mechanics, athletes etc.--have been nearly unanimous in admitting that this film broke their hearts whether they were straight (a majority of those I know) or gay. \\"Brokeback\\" reaches deep into the spirit to touch the existential loneliness we all feel, however loved we may feel ourselves in this life. Amid the stark contrast of lush cinematography of the natural world and the bleakness of man's deteriorating structures, Ennis and Jack have a gnawing hunger to escape this loneliness through each other, and, when that proves impossible because of the interdiction imposed by the time and place, through what passes for a \\"normal\\" life of marriage and children. This is a disaster for Ennis and Jack both, a profound agony for Alma, a painful realized truth for Lureen, and aching sadness for Ennis' daughter, Alma Jr. <br /> <br />Everyone knows the story by now, but you have to be there as so many people have commented to me, when Ennis breaks down in Jack's arms at (what they don't know to be) their final meeting. Ennis realizes for all of us, whatever our lives have been, the crashing of the house of cards we've built on an emotional relationship--the fear of changes Stevie Nicks sings about in \\"Landslide.\\" He is facing the Void and is himself empty. <br /> <br />This film has more depth than any other I've seen in a long time, surely the best by a hundred miles in the last year, including \\"Crash\\". Ledger's performance is way beyond what his young years would make us expect. It is a finely textured rendering of a lost soul barely holding it together--not even the estimable Ang Lee could have gotten that out of an actor less supremely talented; Gyllenhaal brings his \\"A\\" game as a perfect counterpoint to Ledger. All of the women are amazing, right down to the waitress who fruitlessly falls in love with Ennis. <br /> <br />This is a\\"must-see\\" film for anyone whose god is not a homophobe, for this is not a \\"gay\\" film by any means, though it includes gay people as just another part of the human family, which is what they are. This is the story  of the human heart stripped to a sad ultimate truth. We each feel that truth in a different way, but we feel it nonetheless. <br /> <br />The DVD is fine. The extras are skimpy but fine. Truthfully, the film is so overwhelming any person with a modicum of sensitivity will watch the film several times and not care very much about \\"extras\\". Thanks to everyone concerned with giving us this deeply realized work of art.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Let me start by saying that I had not seen the original King Kong, until after seeing Peter Jackson's King Kong.  After watching Peter Jackson's King Kong, I ran out to Best Buy, and picked up the King Kong Collection.  I watched the 1933 version, and was amazed at how much I appreciated BOTH films.  I could certainly see the love that Peter Jackson has for the original film, reflected in his absolutely amazing version.   <br /> <br />Peter Jackson has taken the original, and really given it depth.  We get a great deal of backstory on the characters, and the first third of this film really delivers on character development.  The film sucks you in, and doesn't let go until the final, heartwrenching climax.  Even though it's over an hour into the film before we actually see Kong, the film does not lack substance.  Once we see Kong, the film kicks into high gear with some of the most insane (in a good way) action sequences ever conceived.  Jackson, and his team, deliver the special effects like you've never seen, yet, they are secondary to the story.   <br /> <br />Finally, the film moves into New York, where the bond between Kong and Darrow becomes an intense sequence, leading into the best climax I've seen in a film, for quite some time. <br /> <br />I purchased the 2-Disc Special Edition without hesitation.  I'm so glad that I did.  I've enjoyed this film several times since bringing it home, and the bonus features are very interesting, and informative.   <br /> <br />Pick this one up, and enjoy one the greatest films ever created.  It's a must own!
B000002J1S|5.0|Released in 1974, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is THE magnum opus in the Genesis catalog.  A sprawling and impenetrably dense concept work, this double album saw Peter Gabriel pulling out all of the stops in the concept department.  Interestingly enough, the album was an attempt to move away from fantasy matter and take on a more modern subject which, in this case, involved a Puerto Rican juvenile delinquent named Rael who had a split personality. As an aside, Mike Rutherford initially suggested that the band use the story of The Little Prince as the concept for the album, but Peter felt it was too much like \\"prancing around in fantasyland\\".  I for one am glad they went in the direction that they did.<br /><br />Peter's story mixes Rael's recollections of his home in New York with images of a nightmarish world populated by colonies of hideously deformed Slippermen; the deceptive and wily Lamia that are part female/part snake; blind \\"seers\\"; factories where people are \\"made\\"; and most importantly, Rael's alter ego \\"brother\\" John.  Ultimately, the differences in Rael's split personality are reconciled at the end of the album, as he saves John (Rael) from certain death in the raging rapids of a large river.  Rael is surprised as he pulls John from the river only to find himself staring at his own face.  Peter referred to the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway in interviews as his version of a \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", and was ultimately a \\"transformation\\" story.  Sound intense?  Trust me, it is.<br /><br />The music itself is proportionally intense and features classic Genesis workouts with pieces like In the Cage; The Colony of Slippermen; and the mind-numbing complexity of Riding the Scree.  In addition, Genesis wrote very experimental tracks such as the Waiting Room (which was alternately titled \\"Evil-jam\\").  Although there are some tracks that may seem like filler, I feel that every single note on this album is absolutely essential.  In general, the performances by Steve Hackett (guitar); Tony Banks (Hammond Organ, piano, mellotron, ARP Pro-soloist and 2600); Mike Rutherford (bass, 12 string acoustic); and Phil Collins (drums, backing vocals) are simply breathtaking.<br /><br />The sheer length of the album stemmed from the length of the lyrics themselves.  In fact, it got to the point where the band would finish recording the music, only to have Peter ask them to write more to fit with his additional lyrics.  When Peter was finally done writing, he went into the studio and recorded his vocals over all of the music - much to the shock of the band. Based on what I have read, it was assumed that a number of sections were going to be instrumental, so when lyrics appeared everywhere, they were a little irritated.  I admit that I have to agree with them.  In fact, the medley of the album performed during the 1976-1977 tours (entitled \\"Lamb Stew\\") included instrumental versions of certain tracks and the vocal-less tracks were very powerful, especially Fly on a Windshield.<br /><br />When the album was released, Genesis played it in its entirety to an audience that was expecting concert favorites like Watcher of the Skies and Firth of Fifth - as you can imagine they were completely baffled.  To make matters worse, Peter's vocals were sometimes unintelligible, especially when he was wearing the Slipperman costume - apparently he could not get the microphone close enough.<br /><br />Sadly though, this album was to be Peter's last performance with Genesis and also marked the end of the classic Genesis period.<br /><br />This album is very highly recommended along with Nursery Cryme (1971); Foxtrot (1972), Selling England by the Pound (1973); and the 1967-1975 box set, which includes a live version of the Lamb recorded at the Shrine Auditorium.r); Tony Banks (Hammond Organ, piano, mellotron, ARP Pro-soloist and 2600); Mike Rutherford (bass, 12 string acoustic); and Phil Collins (drums, backing vocals) are simply breathtaking.

B00005JOFQ|3.0|Okay, as a queer rights activist, I was interested in all the hoopla about it, but as a disability rights activist, I rarely go see a film that has no closed captioning (much less a description track).  Also, I am usually bored by love stories, tragic or comedic.  For such reasons I did not see this film until yesterday.<br /><br />I loved the music. The film was pretty dull. I am glad it sparks some more discussions, and if it opens more folks up to justice and kindness, that is wonderful.  But as a movie...eh.  Lovely vistas, barely drawn characters, sturdy livestock, and another couple of stock Hollywood gay characters. (Hollywood gays have come in two main types for about a century: Asexual witty/bitchy style-focused queen or occasionally manly martyr.)<br /><br />Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />Ennis was a right jerk.  He was a jerk to Jack, to his kids, to Alma and to himself. The notion that he was hurting and confused sucks, but it is no excuse. When Alma suggests birth control, he takes her responsible query as an insult. She doesn't even confront him with his affair with Jack until after they are divorced, and when she does, Ennis assaults her - when she's pregnant!<br /><br />The stifling atmosphere of the closet was well-presented, and the pervasiveness. Jack's wife was in the closet, unable to be honest about how Jack died; Alma seemingly had no one to share her knowledge of Ennis' decades-long affair; Jack's parents clearly knew more about Jack than they were willing to say: his dad was full of resentment for his dead son, and his mom had to be sneaky in her grief. Her scene of sharing the truth with Ennis in the only way either dared, with eyes and careful words, was one of the most depressing and brave scenes in the film. The tension was scary, as I waited for Jack's dad to haul off and hit someone, most likely his wife, to prove his manhood.  Those two depressed me more than anyone else in the movie.<br /><br />But, all in all, it was another tragic lovestory, another case where the lovers could only meet rarely and out of sight. As romantic as such episodes can be, I keep thinking that, like so many of these tragic love tales, marriage may not have worked for them. One would squeeze the toothpaste tube \\"wrong\\", one would leave his underwear on the sofa, one would resent the other for emotional distance, different parenting techniques, money issues, jealousy....all the usual crap couples in the world face. Homophobia is only one of the pressures gay couples have to deal with.<br /><br />Torch Song Trilogy, a quarter century ago,  was more groundbreaking than this, in that it showed gay couples actually living together, in the world.  The exotic aloneness of the Ennis and Jack Brokeback interludes, like so many secret trysts of folks having affairs, easily blinds people to how completely contrived and otherwordly the interludes are.<br /><br />The main tragedy is not that these these guys could not be a rancher couple, openly married, the tragedy was that they could not explore any number of options. Ang Lee gave us little of any of these characters.  Maybe that was deliberate, so folks could project multiple things onto them?  Maybe this allows folks to see many different movies.<br /><br />I know I felt choked at the end, not with tears, but with the dust of many dried up lives.  Jack was the juiciest one in the film, the one with the most life. And he was killed just when he was going to live maybe a bit more openly, on a ranch, with a man.  By Hollywood formula, he had to die.<br /><br />Yawn.
1878424319|5.0|This book discusses the four agreements - be impeccable with your words, don't take anything personally, don't make assumptions and always do your best - which help alleviate emotional pains and suffereing faced daily by human beings. Some of the concepts are variants of what I learned from other similar books, and the logical development of the four agreements brought me realization from a different perspective. The most powerful part of the book for me is contained in the last two chapters - the Toltec Path to Freedom and the New Dream. The vivid description of the restraints of individuals by our social expectations reasonates inside my mind. The analysis and solution provided lightened my heart, which has been burdened by my constant conformity to the expectations from people around me. During the reading, my mind and soul were rejuvenated, and joy and hope, which I longed for, once again overflowed inside of me. I hope this book will do the same to you.
1559409002|5.0|<br />Gallons of ink have been devoted, (justifiably) to this film. But few have perhaps paid sufficient due to the cinematographer, Maurice Prather. <br /> <br />Mr. Prather aids and abets the script at every turn in his rendering of Miss Hilligoss's (in the role of Mary Henry) isolation from those around her. From his crow's nest shots of her wandering through the deserted carnival to the scenes of her lone sedan traversing the twilight prairie highway, he unfailingly delivers a picture of un-peopled vastness--a vastness that cannot be breached by human or psychic outreach. <br /> <br />And that is what this film is really about--Mary Henry's inability to accept the fact that she has already departed from the world she continues to haunt. <br /> <br />Ultimately she knows, (as does her personal Charon--the Carnival Ghoul) that she must be reclaimed--and it is in her persistent refusal to yield to his summons, from which the conflict and tension of the film springs. <br /> <br />This is perhaps revealed most disquietingly in a scene near the beginning of the film, when the minister accompanies her to take a look at the abandoned carnival--but refuses to accompany her across the barricade. Thus, though the visit is without ostensible horrific incident--it concludes with a silhouette of the Carnival Ghoul dropping his head in resignation from behind a gated doorway inside the pavilion, while at the very same moment, Miss Hilligoss, (seemingly safe in a car already miles away) is stabbed with a sudden deja vu--reflected with a rueful knowing in her eyes--one of many brilliant moments in a film brimming with them. <br /> <br />And it should not merely be to the cognoscente that such an inevitable moment as this, terrifies far more meaningfully, than any knife wielding Friday the 13th slasher might. <br /> <br />As to Mr. Prather, note how similar are the contrast and tone levels he uses to depict the vast American mid-western landscapes under over-cast skies, to thatused by Sven Nykvist in Bergman's \\"Winter Light.\\" Though the Bergman film is set in Sweden--surely the similarity is not coincidental. <br /> <br />Indeed, some scenes call to mind Caspar David Friedrich, as in the shot of Mary on the sandbar approaching her rescuers on the bridge--a heart in your mouth visual if there ever was one.  <br /> <br />This is your comment, you may delete or edit it.     <br />  <br />
B000BEZPQE|5.0|To retaliate to your reply to Spike's review I will defend Slipknot. I think that Slipknot is a very talented group. The masks they wear are no different than the face makeup and tongue gimmick Kiss uses. Kiss is a very popular band. I don't think you'd say the same thing about Kiss; referring to the fact that you said the only reason they wear the masks is because they can't perform. The masks make them original; they catch attention through looks, to draw a person in. Corey is a also a very talented singer; if you listen to a Stone Sour song, or Vermilion. His voice is very pure in these songs. <br />Joey is an extremely talented drummer. Many of the beats he plays are very complex, and he pulls them off beautifully live. <br />And the masks are quite well designed, Spike, if I might add. <br />I hope I can change your opinion a bit by this Sir Hoek.  <br /> <br />

B000E97Y6K|2.0|The 2005 version of King Kong started out great, with a good flavor of New York during the depression. Eventually it gets too long: dinosaurs and people getting killed or injured all over the place, over and over again. And the Empire State Building scenes also drawn out at the end. And why were those guys in the planes shooting at Kong when Ann was up there too in bullet range. Maybe he was such a menace that they had to sacrifice her in order to bring him down? I wonder why I never thought about that when I viewed the original 1933 version. <br /> <br />So this new version shows a relationship between Ann and Kong. Cool. They could have cut the film down by at least a half hour and accomplished the same thing. When we watch the extras on other DVDs, we see those good deleted scenes that were taken out because they were dragging out the film or parts of it too long. How come nobody thought about that here? <br /> <br />As at least one other reviewer said, I won't be watching this again.
B00005JOWR|4.0|There are a lot of funny bits in this film (William H. Macy saying \\"The great state of Vermont will not apologize for its cheese\\" comes to mind) and in the character of Nick Nolan (a spin doctor for the tobacco industry) it has found someone you love to watch just to see how he'll pull of his next stunt.  He's not an admirable guy--he's a self-absorbed, morally smarmy cad--but he makes a great movie anti-hero.  TO it's great credit, the film does not try for a \\"happy ending,\\"(e.g. lost soul sees the light and switches sides to try to make the world a better place rather than just being motivated by money and \\"paying the mortgage\\".   <br /> <br />The film takes a pretty grim view of Hollywood (some of the best scenes are between Nick and a powerful movie mogul into all things Japanese), big business, politics and, of course, the tobacco industry.  In fact, I can't think of one admirable character portrayed in the film.  Everyone's selling out to someone and for the most part, they're proud of it, as long as it's not depicted in the press in the wrong way. <br /> <br />A thought provoking, fun film.
B000068IEU|3.0|Alright let's be honest here.  The Last House on the Left is a bad movie.  However, it is still worth your time.  Its SEVERLY dated (just look at....everything).  Half of the time you are either shocked or laughing you butt off.  I threw a horror movie festival over spring break one time and this was one of the movies we watched.  Well it was hysterical, most of the time in the beginning we expected porno music to kick in and for a pizza man to show up.  However once it got going, we still found ourselves laughing but also found some moments that were cringing and awesome (from a horror fanatic's point of view).  My favorite scene has to be the dentist nightmare.  What makes this film so shocking has to be the back and forth segments of horror and humor and that this movie was released in 1972.   <br /> <br />Here's the story.  Two girls are on their way to a concert and on their way want to get some pot.  They run into four convicts who end up raping and murdering them in the woods right next to the house of one of the girls.  Since the murderers' car broke down, they decide to stay at the girl's house.  The parents willingly let them stay at their house, feed them and so forth.  Slowly they find out that both the girls are dead and then extract their revenge.  There is a chainsaw scene and might I add that the chainsaw can barely cut and it's amusing how long it takes to saw through a chair!   <br /> <br />This movie is also the first of Wes Craven's directing career.  I've seen several of his films and most of them are good but not great.  This one has a great story but because of an inexperienced director, an extremely low budget and so forth it suffers greatly.  They recently remade Craven's second film, The Hills Have Eyes, and I read online that they are considering remaking this one as well.  After viewing this movie I thought that this is one of the few movies that really deserves a remake providing it has good actors.   <br /> <br />The Last House on the Left is still amusing and I would watch it again.  It's shocking, it's unintentionally funny, intentionally funny (the scene where the policemen run out of gas is hysterical) and most of all cheesy.  Yet at the same time, there are parts that you would not see in movies today and I'm surprised that this was allowed release in theaters back in 1972.   <br /> <br />I'll admit I don't have this DVD, but the cover makes the film appear to be darker than it really is, as the house never looks evil like it does on the box cover.  You'll see what I mean if you watch the Last House on the Left.  Rent this movie for a few laughs and disturbing scenes.   <br />
B000099T3P|4.0|I cannot help but laugh every time I see people bashing each other over a movie. Disliking a certain film is one thing. But for somebody to go out of their way and flagrantly insult a total stranger over their enjoyment of a particular film they happened to hate is unnecessary and immature. Amazon should police these reviews a bit more seriously. <br /> <br />\\"Critters\\" is a fond and harmless throwback to the sort of monster movie so prevalent in the mid-1950s sci-fi boom. I cannot so easily classify the plot as straight-up horror, because it really isn't. This is more of a hodgepodge. You get a smattering of horror, comedy, and science fiction all rolled up within a singular and satisfying package. I caught this in a theater with my father twenty years ago, and it has always remained a guilty pleasure of mine. None of the special effects are overdone, the writing is suitable, and I found most of the cast agreeable and entertaining. <br /> <br />I have found over the years that many of us tend to take our movies way too seriously. In the end, I could really care less that \\"Critters\\" doesn't follow the rules of reality. Because, when I pay to see movies like this, reality is something I want to escape from.
0920668372|1.0|I work in the children's department of a bookstore, and can honestly say that this is one of my least favorite children's books of all time. The artwork is amateurish at best, and the storyline itself, especially at the end, is very weird and rather disturbing. People often ask for this book, and I just don't get the appeal, particularly given how many truly excellent kids' books are out there. Unconditional love is great, but the mother climbing in her grown son's window? That's just plain weird.
0790731002|2.0|The third Batman movie has a new director, a new Batman, and new writers. This would be a pretty good comic book movie - if it was about someone other than Batman. There's too much childish silliness in this film. This silliness will appeal to pre-teens, but will turn off Batman's older fans.<br /><br />Gotham City is a much more technologically advanced city than it had been in the Burton movies. A city famously known in comic books for its dark and gloomy architecture is now as bright and colorful as the Vegas strip. Even the sub-machine guns of the goons are decorated with neon lights. I do not like the look of this movie - it's WAY too bright and colorful for a Batman movie. Danny Elfman was replaced by Eliot Goldenthal. His music for Batman Forever was OK, but his music SUCKS in the next Batman movie. And Robin (Chris O'Donnell) was a good character to have in the Adam West TV show, but Robin's incredibly annoying in this movie - and it never really seems like Batman needs his help either. The new Batmobile looks ridiculous - it seems to be too flashy for a Batman vehicle. And there's WAY too many one-liners, most of which fall flat.<br /><br />Edward Nygma (Jim Carrey) is a disgruntled employee at Wayne Enterprises who becomes obsessed with his boss, Bruce Wayne (played by Keaton's replacement, Val Kilmer). Nygma hopes Wayne will agree to market a new item he created called \\"the box\\" which can beam TV images directly into the human brain, or something like that. After Wayne rejects his idea, Nygma wants revenge. So he becomes the Riddler, and goes to Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) for help. Two-Face and the Riddler are entertaining, but I don't like the way they're portrayed - and that's entirely director Joel Schumacher's fault. I always preferred to think of Two-Face as a cold, calculating, and humorless mob boss. Carrey's Riddler also seemed WAY too hyper. Needless to say, Jones and Carrey give the two best performances in the movie - everyone else gives a bland and/or irritating performance in Batman Forever. Jones is a great actor, but I didn't think he could play such a loud and obnoxious character as Two-Face. But he did a good job, and I commend him for the effort.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne seemed to be a rather reclusive multimillionaire in Burton's movies, but in Batman Forever he's a multibillionaire who is outgoing and has substantial business interests - sort of an `ultra-capitalist' if you will. I guess inflation rates forced the writers to make Wayne's fortune even bigger. Wayne did make investments and such in Burton's movies, but as far as we know there was never such a thing as `Wayne Enterprises'. But I actually am glad that Wayne Enterprises and Arkham Asylum appear in this movie, because they're two of Gotham City's biggest landmarks in the comics. Kilmer showed promise the way he delivered the line \\"You need help Harvey.\\" In that instant, it looks as though Kilmer might be able to recapture the malevolence that Keaton brought to the role. But after that moment passes, Kilmer is a crappy Batman for the rest of the movie. Kilmer's performance is so wooden it seems as though he's uncomfortable in his role. And Kilmer has even less than Keaton to work with as far as Bruce Wayne goes. Wayne is even more of a caricature than he was in the Burton movies. Batman's lack of character development and lack of malevolence are major disappointments in this movie.<br /><br />Two-Face is responsible for the death of Dick Grayson's family. Of course, Wayne feels somewhat responsible for their death. He can also relate to Dick, since Wayne's parents had also been murdered when he was a kid. So Wayne adopts him. And of course, Dick becomes Robin. Batman refuses to accept him as a partner for most of the movie. Then Batman decides to go after the Riddler and Two-Face, and he suddenly changes his mind, saying \\"Two against two are better odds.\\" I have the impression Batman was more concerned about his own self-preservation thanRobin's well-being.<br /><br />Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) adds nothing to this movie. But a love interest for Batman is necessary for the final showdown, or else the movie would completely lose its punch - not that it has much anyway. She and Batman/Bruce Wayne have absolutely no chemistry - especially in the last scene of the movie.<br /><br />There's some cool stuff in Batman Forever, like the rotating platform the Batmobile is parked on and the Bat Signal. There's some cool parts too, like when the Batcave gets destroyed, when the goons machinegunned the elevator, and when Two-Face shot the helicopter pilot. I was also impressed by the big fight Batman has with the goons when he comes out of the elevator. But I hated that tazer gun - it's too silly a weapon for Batman to use. There's also some horrible parts, like when the Batmobile drives up the wall of a building. Batman was always capable of doing stuff that's impossible in our reality, but there are limits to how much absurdity I can take in a Batman movie. Schumacher crossed the line with that scene. And seeing a dog using \\"the box\\" is another instance of something that doesn't belong in a Batman movie. And I wonder what the people of Gotham were thinking when they saw all that green stuff floating through the city's air? I refer to the green stuff that gets transmitted by each individual \\"box\\" to a \\"huge box\\" that obviously looks like it's channelling all the green stuff for EVIL purposes. You'd think that federal regulators would at least check out what that \\"huge box\\" was doing. I used to give Batman Forever three stars, but after seeing Batman Begins, it's flaws become even more glaringly apparent.tion than Robin's well-being. <br /> <br />Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) adds nothing to this movie.

B00000IN5G|5.0|This is an awesome melodic death metal album. Proper TRUE metal. None of the junk fake metal found on MTV (Nu-metal, Metalcore etc) but excellent and heavy. There's lots of melody in the whole album, none of this grungy droning sound. The vocalist is good at delivering death growls, compared to the lame emo-screming found in, let's say Trivium. The whole album contains loads of instruments, instead of the usual guitar, bass, drums. Bed Of Razor stats with harps, there's lot of piano sounds in Downfall, and strings in Warheart... to name a few. Buy this album, and marvel at the talent!!
0790730960|4.0|Batman Returns is the sequel to 1989's Batman. It has a lot of flaws, but I still enjoy it everytime I sit down to watch it. Keaton's back as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Wayne has a little more personality in Batman Returns, so he's not as boring as he was in the first movie. It would have been nice if the first action scene was longer, where Batman fights the (don't laugh) Red Triangle Circus Gang. You'd think that if some circus performers were tearing apart the city that they'd send in a SWAT team or a heavily armed riot control squad to restore order. But the cops don't really try to stop them. I guess they're lazy, and just leave all the hard work for Batman. The comic book Batman would never kill criminals. Burton's Batman has no qualms about it. That is sacrilege to most Batman fans, but it didn't bother me. I treat Burton's Batman movies the same way I treat a Batman storyline such as Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns. Comic purists will understand what I'm talking about. It's good to have a reinterpretation of old comic book heroes every now and then, but I found Schumacher's movies to be so offensive and uncool, that I detest the way Batman is portrayed.<br /><br />The Penguin (Danny Devito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) are more formidable adversaries for Batman than the Joker. Unsurprisingly, they team up to take out Batman - and come up with a great plan. Batman blew through the Joker and his gang, but this pair give Batman LOTS of trouble. But the problem now is that Batman is overshadowed by not one, but TWO major villains in HIS OWN movie. Batman Begins also had two major villains, but they remained in the background - Bruce Wayne was always at the forefront.<br /><br />The Penguin is a deformed (and lecherous) fellow. He was entertaining at first, but by the time he `saved' the baby I began to find him irritating. Towards the end of the movie, he's INCREDIBLY ANNOYING. The low-point of the movie is when he gives a speech to the penguin army (yes, there actually is an army of birds with rockets strapped to their backs). It looked like Burton was trying to make the Penguin look like Winston Churchill or George S. Patton. As a huge Batman fan, that scene embarrasses me. The Penguin also has some amusing scenes, like when he makes everyone gasp at Shreck's party (after announcing his plans), and when he's screaming at Batman on a video monitor in the Batmobile.<br /><br />Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) is a lousy villain, and he shouldn't be in this movie. His screentime should've been given to one of the other main characters. Max is trying to take over the city (*yawn*) and build a power plant that doesn't make energy - it STORES energy. So Max tries to manipulate the Penguin into becoming the mayor - then Max would be the `power behind the throne' if he wins. But the whole bit about the Penguin running for mayor should've been cut - it would've been better if the Penguin was just a popular celebrity in Gotham City, who worked on fiendish plots behind the scenes. And why on Earth would Shreck use the head of Felix the Cat as his corporate logo?<br /><br />Back in the day, the action scenes in this movie was what I liked best, but Danny Elfman's music during the opening credits always kept me spellbound. Elfman's music sounds even better than it did in the first movie. If not for the music, I'd enjoy this movie a lot less. The scene when the six penguins walk out near the end of the movie is one of the most preposterous sights in cinematic history, but Elfman's music does give the scene a degree of emotional power. The same can be said for the scene when Batman drives by the Hall of Records and stares coldly at the Penguin (as Batman doubts whether the Penguin is the saint he's being made out to be). And the music sounds great when the Penguin goes to the grave of his parents.<br /><br />There were some really cool scenes, like the fights between the Catwoman and Batman. And when the Penguin fell through the skylight as the Arctic World was being destroyed. And when Catwoman tore apart her apartment after she was nearly killed. And the close-up of the Penguin's face as he sinks beneath the water. And when Batman went down on a harness to the Penguin's lair. And the noise of the Batskiboat as it approaches the Penguin's lair (and the look of dismay on everyone's faces). And when the organ grinder sees Batman's reflection, right before he gets yanked out of his seat. And like the first movie, there's a cool scene where Batman dons his suit, set to Elfman's awesome music. And no, Burton DID NOT film it anything like the way Schumacher did in Batman Forever.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite part of Batman Returns is when it shows Wayne alone in a darkened room, and looks to be deep in thought - he's in a pose that makes one think of Rodin's `The Thinker' (does anyone actually sit like that when they're thinking?) Then a spotlight comes on, and the Bat Signal illuminates the room. Elfman's music suits that scene perfectly. But if I was Bruce Wayne, I wouldn't have a huge spotlight like that on my roof - it would look awfully suspicious.<br /><br />Most people say Pfeiffer's Catwoman stole the show. But I didn't think anyone's performance stood out. If I had to pick someone, I'd say Keaton was the best in this movie. But I'm admittedly a biased Batman fan, so my opinion doesn't count for anything. I'd say Batman Returns features an incredibly talented cast stuck in a movie where the action is a lot more important than storyline or character development.

B000B5XOYI|3.0|There are two DVD box sets that contain the Batman movies of Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher - The Batman Legacy and The Batman Motion Picture Anthology. My advice is to see these movies ahead of time, and buy the ones you like individually. I GUARANTEE YOU WON'T WANT TO BUY ALL FOUR MOVIES - unless of course, you're a DVD collector like me, who loves DVD extras. A serious DVD collector will not buy The Batman Legacy - they'll shell out some extra coin to get The Batman Motion Picture Anthology. That box set comes with 18 hours of extras. The Batman Legacy doesn't have any good DVD extras, so movie buffs won't be interested in getting that box set. But if you don't care about DVD extras, and just want to acquire all four films, you may as well get The Batman Legacy.<br /><br />As a fan of the Batman comics, I can recognize a lot of problems with all four movies. The first two were directed by Tim Burton, and are generally well-liked today. But the last two were directed by Joel Schumacher, and they're generally reviled by everyone. These Batman movies show what happens when a popular series is put in the hands of a director with a completely different vision, who ultimately destroys the series. THAT is the lasting legacy of this series. The series lost a lot of steam after Schumacher made Batman Forever, a movie that alienated a lot of Batman fans. Then Schumacher made Batman & Robin - and the series lost all credibility after that movie came out. In the case of the Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus (who directed the first two Potter movies) said he wanted to ensure that the next Potter director would not stray too far from the style of his first two movies - and he cited this Batman series as an example of what he hoped to avoid.<br /><br />Burton's movies are enjoyable - but a little ridiculous. Some of the villains and goons were a bit too cartoonish for my liking in Batman Returns, but they're WAY too cartoonish in the Schumacher movies. However, the character of Batman in Burton's movies is perfect. Batman may be a hero, but the character is so dark and gritty that there's a real malevolence to him. The Kilmer and Clooney Batmen didn't have that malevolence - so viewers won't experience the sense of awe and wonder that Keaton's Batman evoked from them.<br /><br />Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) is in the first Batman movie. He doesn't turn into Two-Face in this movie. I figure they wanted Dent to appear in this movie with the hope of making him a villain in a future sequel. Williams doesn't add much of anything to this movie - but it would have been AWESOME if Burton had Williams play Two-Face in a Batman sequel. Too bad Two-Face doesn't appear until Batman Forever, when Schumacher took over. Even though Batman Forever is a sequel, Schumacher completely ignores Williams' portrayal of Dent, and cooks up a completely different character for Tommy Lee Jones to play. In a Burton movie, it's safe to say that Williams would be playing a leaner, meaner and less eccentric Two-Face than we saw in Schumacher's movie. The first Batman is also the only movie of the series where the villain's goons are cool - but they would have been cooler if they kept their old fashioned mobster appearance of fedoras and trenchcoats. The goons in Batman Begins are ninjas - and there are few things on Earth that are cooler than ninjas.<br /><br />Batman Forever was a rude awakening for those of us who expected the Batman series to retain the same style as Burton's movies. Schumacher and the writers didn't know how to make a good Batman movie, and Kilmer was miscast as Batman. Batman didn't deserve the title of 'World's Greatest Detective' in Batman Forever. He should've done some investigating into Nygmatech when he suspected that \\"the box\\" could be used for evil purposes. Batman certainly dropped the ball that time. Anyway, Schumacher was trying to make Batman Forever a much more lighthearted film. Then he made the travesty that is Batman and Robin, which is like an updated remake of Batman: The Movie and the Adam West TV series. And for the record, I'm a big fan of the Adam West TV show. That show was a product of its time. But IT'S NOT suitable for this day and age - Schumacher should've known better. But I imagine he was a huge fan of the TV series, and this was probably his way of paying homage to it. Another serious problem with his movies was the way the villains were portrayed. Bane, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler, and Two-Face were all too obnoxious and/or annoying for my liking. I expect The Joker to behave like a clown, but TWO-FACE and MR. FREEZE? What was Schumacher thinking?<br /><br />Let me put it this way. If you loved Batman and/or Batman Returns, you'll probably be able to tolerate Batman Forever, but you'll HATE Batman and Robin. If you love the Adam West TV show, you might like Schumacher's movies. But it's hard to say, because Batman & Robin is a terrible movie, whether you like bright and cheerful superhero movies or not. Fans of the Batman comic books will appreciate Burton's movies, dislike Schumacher's movies, and LOVE Batman Begins - but that movie isn't a part of this Batman series, so it's not in this DVD set.<br /><br />I myself will be getting the Anthology - I'd LOVE to hear the commentaries from Schumacher.

B0006A9FMI|4.0|It's very sad, really, that Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence was handled the way it was. A lot of people just can't forgive Dreamworks for basically throwing this together as quickly as possible to make a quick dime from the fans of anime. And the exclusion of a dub track is what really damages this movie. There is a lot of dialogue in this movie, long moments when the characters are basically stationary and the only action is the moving of mouths. It can be frustrating having to read a movie as gorgeously animated as this one, especially for fans who don't have much of a care for foreign or subtitled tracks.<br /><br />But I don't think it kills this movie, mostly because, though I generally prefer a dubbed track, I will watch a subbed track if that is all that's available. And the subs weren't bad in this, so that makes things a little better.<br /><br />Plus, like the last Ghost in the Shell, Innocence has a quality story filled with plenty of side-plots and mysteries to unfold. Also like the last movie, it's great getting the feeling of accomplishment when you finally begin to put all the separate pieces together. In this one, it follows Batou, the Major's partner from the previous movie, as he investigates a series of murders done by robots. Along the way, he finds \\"sex-bots\\" are some of the ones responsible for these crimes, and finds himself in an interweaving world of internet hacking and tough crime fighting. And during all of this, Batou continues his search for the Major, who is still missing after the events in Ghost in the Shell.<br /><br />Despite my ranking of a four, it is still difficult to recommend this. That's more a personal four than an all around four. I felt the story and the animation still hold up despite the dismal DVD release. So, if you enjoy subbed tracks over dubbed, then you will most likely find nothing wrong with this DVD in any way. Also, if you liked Tokyo Godfathers, Millennium Actress, and/or Memories because of the great stories despite them having no dubbed track, then I also think you'll find Innocence worth watching. But if you don't like foreign movies, and hate reading subtitles, then stay away from Innocence; it will only leave a bad taste in your mouth and you'll find yourself disliking anime because of it.dubbed track, then I also think you'll find Innocence worth watching.

Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.<br /><br />Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.<br /><br />What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.<br /><br />This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read.

B000BT97AO|4.0|Well, it isn't \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" but this movie is worth watching simply for the special effects. Nor do you really think \\"special effects\\" when you are watching the movie; more like \\"window into another world, one of incredibly original and beautiful design.\\" Think flying stone giants, fish swimming through the air, a pillar of key-holes, winged cats, and flying books.  <br /> <br />That said, the storyline is a bit spotty, and sometimes it is a bit hard to tell exactly what is going on. Don't expect an explosive conclusion, although all the loose ends are tied up nicely.  <br /> <br />Despite the patchy story and occasionally shallow characters, the humor is near-constant. The dialogue rarely drags, as the script contains a lot of snappy one-liners. Someone else noted that the opening felt television-like, but I liked the sock puppets immensely.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Knowing that I was a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, my co-worker lent me the Firefly series to watch. Now this guy is a big science fiction fan and I am not. I truly find shows/movies with space travel, overblown CGI and characters (aliens) with elaborate prosthetics to be insipid and one of the lowest forms of fictional entertainment. I endured the recent Star Wars movies with my family since I felt it was a Constitutional duty. Begrudgingly I accepted my co-workers offer and felt compelled to watch at least some of the shows since I knew he would want to discuss them with me. <br /> <br />I must say that I surprised myself when I was so readily hooked on the show. Sure there was this weird hybrid of Western/Science Fiction that yes, does include space travel, but what makes this series and every other script-based show successful, is a strong story line and endearing characters. After a viewing a few episodes, I was sure that Kaylee was my favorite character, but by the time I finished the set, I couldn't decide which character I cared for most. This is the hallmark of Joss Whedon; strong storylines delivered by likeable yet flawed characters. The viewer can not only relate to the characters, they can empathize with them. When I returned the series to my co-worker, I thanked him and told him that I would be purchasing the series and the Serenity movie. I told him that the set is in the top 20 sales at Amazon and the word must be spread about this show in order for it to return rightfully to television. My co-worker has turned on three people to this show and I plan to continue to spread the word. Firefly deserved a better fate; it is up to those who left positive feedback to try to reverse that fate. <br />
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Some films work more effectively on a visceral level than a logical one, and this 2005 film adaptation of U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 biting memoir is one of them. Chronicling the author's time from boot camp through the brief 1991 Gulf War, director Sam Mendes fills his sometimes blackly comic film with brutalizing images that give it a consistently propulsive urgency. Written by William Broyles Jr. (who had wartime duty in Vietnam as a pilot), it is not really a combat film as the focus of the story is the incessant waiting that the ground troops endured before realizing the conflict was over almost as soon as it began. Mendes and Broyles have us look at the preparation for the ground war within an episodic structure that keeps everything at arm's length emotionally. Moreover, they borrow liberally from previous military-themed films - not only obvious references to scenes from Stanley Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and Brian DePalma's \\"Casualties of War\\" but also paeans to the group dynamics in WWII-era movies with each of the Marines representing familiar wartime archetypes.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the fresh-faced Swofford and does an admirable job here as he outwardly expresses his enthusiasm, especially when he gets chosen to be a surveillance sniper, but inwardly has gnawing misgivings about his tour of duty. His becalmed voiceover is what ties the loose connective tissue of the story, as well as the constant punishment Swofford receives from his superiors, including a humiliating demotion from lance corporal to private for covering an act of false bravado by a fellow recruit. Peter Sarsgaard plays Swofford's scouting partner Troy in his trademark elliptical manner given that his character's motivations remain suspect until revelations come to light toward the end. Due to the nature of the film, other characters are not as fully realized, including Jamie Foxx doing commendable work in a relatively small role as the unyielding Staff Sgt. Sykes (his one personal scene when he discusses his life at home seems shoehorned in), Dennis Haysbert in a couple of scenes as the arrogant Major Lincoln, Chris Cooper effectively Schwartzkopf-like as Lt Colonel Kazinski, and the young actors portraying Swofford's fellow recruits. It took me a while to recognize Lucas Black, who plays the horny redneck Kruger, as the young boy in Billy Bob Thornton's \\"Sling Blade\\".<br /><br />Performances aside, the standout work is Roger Deakins' cinematography, which captures the surreal atmosphere of the deserts with the mirage-inducing heat during the day and the burning oil wells at night. There are few scenes more painfully evocative of the war than the one where the Marines come upon the charred remains of locals frozen as if caught in an A-bomb attack. The overall realism of the movie is what makes this noteworthy, and to the filmmakers' credit, it has no political agenda beyond showing the agonies of serving in prospect of a war. The soundtrack has period-appropriate music that runs the gamut from Nirvana to Naughty by Nature to C+C Music Factory. The obvious comparison the film engenders is with David O. Russell's 1999 \\"Three Kings\\", which shares the same setting and a similar orientation toward black comedy, though I have to say that Russell's film is more inventive. Still, Mendes is an individualistic director whose work is always worth experiencing.<br /><br />The DVD has several solid extras, including two separate commentary tracks. Interestingly, the one with Swofford and Broyles, both familiar with military service firsthand, is more informative than the one provided by Mendes, who focuses more on the themes and his inspirations. There are a handful of deleted scenes which were understandably excised, including one with Sam Rockwell playing Swofford's gung-ho military uncle talking to the camera (actually to Swofford in a flashback), a seeming rip-off of a Christopher Walken's scene in \\"Pulp Fiction\\". There is anotherset of scenes under the umbrella of Swofford's fantasies, also deleted, but intriguing for the black comedy aspect that they seemed to serve. Also included is a longer version of the interview sequence where the media volleys questions to the recruits in documentary style. Veteran film editor Walter Murch adds his commentary to Mendes' on all the deleted scenes.umbrella of Swofford's fantasies, also deleted, but intriguing for the black comedy aspect that they seemed to serve.

B00000F169|1.0|This movie is terrible.  The synopsis is completely misleading.  Don't waste money or time on this one!
B000F6IOC0|2.0|\\"Underworld: Evolution\\" (just saying that gives me the giggles) is all about brotherly love gone way wrong. Or right.<br /><br />Or out of control---I mean, really, who's to judge, when you're a bloodthirsty immortal critter, way long in the tooth, with big old fleshy batwings who's been consigned to the vamp-version of Solitaire for 600 years or so?<br /><br />Whatever. At the very least, \\"Underworld 2\\" manages to answer the question: \\"where does a Thousand-pound p*ssed-off Werewolf sit?\\"<br /><br />Answer: any-damned-where he wants.<br /><br />I was a big fan of the first installment, which was all somber-gothic moonscapes and undead power politics and some gory bloodshed and high style and---umm, did I mention Kate Beckinsdale in a leather catsuit yet? No?<br /><br />Anyhoo, I wish I could say nicer things about director Len Wiseman's latest paean to things that flap, howl, and bump in the night, but what it boils down to is really three things:<br /><br />1)Len Wiseman doesn't really *like* vampires. Or werewolves (cough, cough, *Lycans*). Or more to the point, monsters.Why? Because he really takes great pains---in the last flick, and finally, totally, in this one---to burn both classic monsters out of the running.<br /><br />Forever: hence \\"Evolution\\". In other words, he wants to make his movie monsters normal, full-blooded, all-American, apple-pie eating, suburb-living, SUV-driving ordinary gals and dolls.<br /><br />So: death-dealer Selene gets a little hybrid-juice in her veins, hangs around in broad daylight, and gets some missionary position good love from hybrid hubby Michael Corvin (the horrible, godawful, still annoying-as-ever Scott Speedman), maybe buying a ranch-home in Colorado and having a couple kids and a family dog.<br /><br />Sure. If you want to see daylight and get a tan, sweetheart, try a tanning bed.<br /><br />2) Nobody seems to be having any damned fun in the world of \\"Underworld: Underworlder\\"---and that's really a shame. What's the point of living forever if you're not going to loosen up and enjoy yourself? All we have is War, War, War.<br /><br />Look: if I'm a vampire, I'm not gonna hunker down in some stinky, squalid, dim-lit bunker arsenal, fidgeting and twitching about getting it on with the hairy gang down the block. And---anyone?---why are we all hanging around freezing our undead butts off in the Czech Republic, anyway?<br /><br />Nobody seems to be having any fun in \\"Underworld\\": certainly not vampires Selene or her black-eyed buddy Corvin, nor poor vamp pater-familias Alex(Derek Jacobi, who prisses around in what looks like the castoff duds from \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" before dying like an ineffective, whimpering little b*tch), and certainly not uber-vamp-flappy-thingy Marcus (Tony Curran).<br /><br />Indeed, the only guy living it up with chicks and booze and rock n' roll is Andreas Tanis, and he's a hated exile living in prison, who is quickly and nastily put down like a sick dog. I rest my case.<br /><br />3) Look, if you're a batwinged-flappy thing (Marcus) or his 10-foot-high lupine brother ummm, William, don't flap or stalk out in front of a high-velocity machine-gun and just hover/stand there. Not a good career move. Very damaging to the pelt.<br /><br />Now, don't misunderstand me: Underworld: Deader\\" isn't without some hair of the dog that bit me---the opening carnage in a snowbound medieval village between a troop of vampires and their hairy buddies is gorgeous, slickly shot, and caked with blood and gore.<br /><br />And the backstory---a ravenous, blood-hungry werewolf entombed in a fortress-prison designed for him---is delicious. And the trappings here are ultra-glossy and very slick, whether it's some long-deserted oubliette or high-tech battle gear.<br /><br />And hell, at some point---and I confess, I was pretty liquored up by the end of \\"Underworld: Catsuit\\", so this might not actually have happened---someone brought a helicopter to the gunfight. Seriously. Oh, and a decentamount of the red sauce is spilled.<br /><br />But in the end, Wiseman has traded the politics of betrayal that infused the first flick with a little dignity for the wham-bam action wild rumpus of a chase flick: monster breaks out of prison, monster chases heroes, heroes chase monster, big-a**ed battle, close credits.<br /><br />And frankly, it's just not all that interesting to watch. With that in mind: does anyone think the DVD cover art makes it look like Selene is holding twin scalpels? And does anyone think that might have made for a better movie?<br /><br />JSGer to the gunfight. Seriously.

Some of the parts couldve been taken out, eventhough they might have been interesting, but it was just too long. <br /> <br />This is definately more a commercial movie than a literal or entertaining movie.  <br /> <br />But still, I liked watching it once.

B00009ATIX|5.0|I am embarrassed to admit that I was not aware of novelist Stanislaw Lem until learning about his recent death.  And no, I have yet to read the novel this movie is based on.  Is that good or bad?  Often, it's better not to be familiar with the original creation.  This particular interpretation should have never been released to mainstream audiences.  The masses were never going to be pleased.  Solaris is a \\"fine arts\\" production.  George Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Steven Soderbergh, and the other major artists were essentially committing themselves, whether they knew it or not, to a work of love.  Who am I?  Is there a God? Do our lives make any sense?  What does it mean to have a soul?  Can a copy of a person be almost as good as the real one?  Are the dead able to be brought back to life in some way?  These existential questions underpin the story. George Clooney effectively portrays a man who is reacquainted with his dead wife (McElhone).  Is it really her---or is this a monstrous joke inflicted on him by unseen forces?  This film is slow, but try paying attention.  The investment is likely to pay off.  I will almost certainly be haunted by Solaris for a long time into the future.<br /><br />David Thomson<br />Flares into Darkness
B0007YMUZW|5.0|As a devout Ryan Adams fan, I didn't think he could exceed the level of brilliance he hit with Heartbreaker and even Stranger's Almanac (Whiskeytown).  However, the album is clearly his finest work.  It is starting to rank with Wilco's Summerteeth as the finest album I have ever heard.<br /><br />Sweet Illusions, When will you come back home, Easy Plateau, If I were a stranger, and Cold Roses are simply incredible songs.  Sweet Illusions is a song I think we have all been at.  What a treat.  I can't get enough of it.<br /><br />Adams has a way of putting a twist on simple lyrics to give songs a deeper meaning that you can keep coming back to and finding new things.  The way he describes feelings and emotions that you have but haven't verbalized or even put into thought is simply incredible.  And while he does this on all his albums, Cold Roses reflects this act perfectly.  I highly, highly recommend this album.
0553804227|5.0|Als ein hervorragender und gar nicht mal extrem amerikanischer (Anti-)Kriegsfilm kann &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; bezeichnet werden. <br />Vorgelegt wird eine schöne, relativ edle Metallbox mit 10 Folgen eben jener Miniserie auf 6 DVDs, die eigentlich aber als überlanger Film zu bezeichnen sind; die Geschichte beschreibt die wahren Erlebnisse der Soldaten der Easy Company der 101st Airborne Division von der Ausbildung zum Fallschirmjäger über den Absprung hinter den deutschen Linien am D-Day über die &quot;Operation Market Garden&quot; in Holland, die Ardennenoffensive in Belgien und schließlich das Kriegsende in Deutschland, bei dem die Easy Company sogar Hitlers Kehlsteinhaus okkupieren dürfen. Hier findet sich allerdings eine kleine historische Ungenauigkeit, denn eben dieses von Martin Bormann 1938 in Auftrag gegebene &quot;Teehaus&quot; hoch in den Berchtesgadener Alpen haben die Franzosen als erstes betreten dürfen. Da die Serie aber auf den Erinnerungen der echten Easy-Veteranen basiert und dort oben offenbar keine Franzosen aufzufinden waren, geht diese Ungenauigkeit in Ordnung.<br />Filmtechnisch ist das von Tom Hanks und Steven Spielberg produzierte Werk an &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; angelehnt, gleicht dessen inhaltliche Schwächen wie z.B. überzogenen Patriotismus durch eine realistische Darstellung der Kämpfe und die Fokussierung auf die Psyche der Soldaten aus und übertrifft &quot;Ryan&quot; bei weitem, wobei insbesondere die Ausmaße der Szenarien höchst beeindruckend sind. Ein weiterer Vorteil ist, daß beinahe nur unbekannte -aber dennoch herausragende- Schauspieler gecastet wurden, was die Soldaten als Gruppe noch deutlicher herausstellt. <br />Die absoluten Highlights der Serie sind für mich die Folgen 6 und 7, &quot;Bastogne&quot; und &quot;The Breaking Point&quot;. Beide Folgen handeln von der Ardennenoffensive im Dezember 1944 bzw. Januar 1945 und zeigen den Kampf der eingekesselten Easy Company in den Wäldern Belgiens gegendie Deutschen, die durch diese massive Offensive das komplette Kriegsgeschehen zu ihren Gunsten drehen wollten. <br />Die Darstellung der Kriegsszenen ist dabei eine Klasse für sich und mir fällt auf Anhieb kein ander Film ein, der die Bezeichnung &quot;Antikriegsfilm&quot; mehr verdient hätte. <br />Weiterhin ist positiv zu vermerken, daß die Deutschen nicht per sé als marodierende Nazi-Monster dargestellt werden, nein, vielmehr werden die Wehrmachtssoldaten am Ende in Folge 10 auf eine Stufe mit den Amerikanern gesetzt, als ein deutscher General eine Ansprache hält, die von einem GI übersetzt wird; daraufhin realisieren die Amerikaner, daß beide Seiten (auch die Mehrheit der Deutschen) nicht kämpfen wollten, sondern mußten und daß die Deutschen zum großen Teil auch nur ganz normale Soldaten waren, was beeindruckend von den echten Veteranen auf der Bonus-DVD geschildert wird.<br />Zur Darstellung des Verhaltens der deutschen Truppen, das hier oft bemängelt wird: <br>Diese Darstellung ist nicht falsch; nimmt man den Angriff auf die Artilleriestellung bei Brécourt Manor (Folge 2) als Beispiel, so lässt sich in verschiedenen Geschichtsbüchern nachlesen, dass dieser Angriff tatsächlich so passiert ist; die Deutschen waren schlicht und ergreifend vollkommen verwirrt, weil es ein Überraschungsangriff war, auf den sie nicht vorbereitet waren. Auch der Angriff auf Carentan in Folge3 ist so geschehen, denn die Waffen-SS war zahlenmäßig unterlegen und war von der Führung in der Tat nur zum leichten Widerstand beordert, da Verstärkung in Form von Panzern und zusätzlicher Infanterie unterwegs war, die Carentan von vornherein zurückerobern sollten. <br />Die viel kritisierte Szene in Folge 5, bei dem Richard Winters &quot;aus der Hüfte&quot; schießt, ist ebenfalls laut seinen eigenen (&quot;Beyond Band of Brothers&quot;) und auch anderen, unabhängigeren Berichten so geschehen, weil die Deutschen taktisch äußerst unklug und fast ohne Deckung positioniert waren, sodass &quot;Easy&quot; aus einer strategisch höchst vorteilhaften Position trotz Unterzahl ein Hasenschießen veranstalten konnte, wobei auch noch Artillerie-Unterstützung dazu kam. <br />So, damit nicht genug: <br />Die 6. DVD enthält sehr viel schönes Bonusmaterial wie z.B. eine Original-Dokumentation, die leider im Guido Knopp-Hobby-Historiker-Stil gehalten ist, bei der Interviews mit den &quot;richtigen&quot; Easy Company-Männern im Vordergrund stehen. <br />Beim Schauen der Dokumentation merkt man deutlich, daß die Folgen der Serie auf den Erzählungen der Männer beruhen, auch ein schönes Making-Of ist dabei. <br />Weiterhin ist äußerst positiv zu vermerken, dass der sonst für amerikanische Produktionen so typische Pathos/Patriotismus völlig ausgeblendet wird; es laufen keine Amerikaner mit wehenden Flaggen ins MG-Kreuzfeuer und sterben den ultimativen Heldentod, keiner haucht mit seinen letzten Worten aus, dass er froh ist, für sein Land zu sterben; Respekt, das hätte ich als bekennender Kritiker amerikanischer (Anti)-Kriegsfilme dem Produzentenduo Hanks/Spielberg nicht zugetraut, die mit &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; technisch großartige Arbeit leisteten, sich aber schlussendlich in Floskeln und Pathos verloren. <br />Sogar als Kriegsverbrecher werden in dieser Serie zwei amerikanische Soldaten teilweise dargestellt (Capt. Speirs, Cpl. Liebgott).<br />Also wie gesagt, wer einen guten Kriegsfilm sehen will, schaue sich &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; an, denn eine authentischere, unvoreingenommenere Nachzeichnung des Zweiten Weltkriegs aus amerikanischer Sicht habe ich bisher noch nicht gesehen.

B000BTGY1O|2.0|Don't get me wrong, Breakfast at Tiffany's is definitely a classic, mainly because of Audrey Heburn's immortal portray of Holly Golightly. This was apparently HER movie, she was the epitome of beauty, class, and style in this role. I've tried to watch this movie twice without thinking about the hype...personally, this movie was boring to me. The love story is sweet, but nothing worth bragging home about. I loved Audrey Hepburn, but the character to me got kind of old. Yes, she's stunning, a tad bit eccentric, witty, and she wears designer clothes and loves money, but if you took away all that there would be no character at all! I found her to be a tad bit superficial, annoying and spoiled. There's nothing about this character to like other than what she wears and how she acts or talks. But this is just my opinion...this will always be a classic, but it doesn't necessarily mean that everyone has to like it or love it simply because it's Audrey Hepburn wearing a chic black dress and staring up at a Tiffany's window.
B000000W5B|5.0|the only aspect of this album which may turn customers away would be its somewhat repulsive title, but, to me at least, the obscurity of the title slightly turned me on in thinking that it would be somewhat of a hidden treausure, buried deep in the soil beneath their long string of more well-liked mainstream rock classics, and i was right in thinking that, because this is at times more endurable than exile.  <br />   the voodoo rhythyms of dancing with mr d are cool, and you will find yourself resisting to smile at its extreme coolness, which i guess is the only word i can find to describe such a song <br />   100 years ago is a lovely three part ballad, with great clavinet by billy preston, who appears on many rolling stones recordings. this continues the whole mystical air of the recording, which adds to the drama and effect which one receives while listening, as though staring through a blurry window at what's inside. and one can make an easy assumption that thats just what they were attempting to do. <br />    coming down again is beatiful and i believe has a great keef vocal, although some may object to that statement. also, in past reviews i read that this was about something, although im not sure of what, so im stil looking into whatever story this ones about. <br />  speaking of stories, angie has quite an interesting one, but isnt approriate enough to be shared in detail so ill just give some brief keywords.  <br />    DAVID BOWIE  <br />    MICK JAGGER <br />    BEDROOM <br />    DAVID BOWIES WIFE ANGIE <br /> <br />  aside from that story, the album carries well in a mystical sort of way, and is very entertaining.

The cast was great,the costumes and of course Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossums \\"Point of no Return\\" was outstanding. It had a combination of different parts that kept it interesting. Was sad and yet in a strange way- romantic in some parts. It definitly deserved a better rating than it got- the actors all played their characters very well. I really love this movie!!

I am so proud of her and can't wait for her to come out with more music and to go on tour! <br /> <br />By far, this is the BEST album she has ever made.  Every song is my favorite and I have a copy for my car, a copy for my disc-man and am in the process of putting it on my ipod.   <br /> <br />One of the songs \\"Dear Mr. President\\", was truly a message that the President should definitely hear because it speaks on behalf of many Americans today.  \\"Stupid girls\\", is a hilarious song/video that makes fun of the girls of Hollywood and how they are all the same and how stupid they act.   <br /> <br />Make sure you pick up a copy of \\"I'm Not Dead\\" and also tell all of your friends!  You will not be disappointed!!

It gives such a great insight to how life was all those years ago. It has fun stories, and shows a very loving, dear family taking care of each other.<br /><br />My kids and I were so inspired by this book, we read the entire series, and then went on a trip to visit the locations where all the books took place. I highly recommend that others do the same. Standing on ground where Laura and her family played and worked, seeing things Pa built, seeing Pa's fiddle...it was a FANTASTIC trip!<br /><br />My kids and I highly recommend this book, as well as all the others in the Little House series. They all give a great sense of history, but have life-lessons that are still valuable today.
6304708521|5.0|Personally, I loved this film! I mean c'mon folks, have a sense of humor! The Magical Mystery Tour wasn't meant to have a plot, and it definitely wasn't meant to be taken so seriously. If you just watch it for what it is--a fun, goofy, witty, clever, and laugh-out-loud-psychadelic trip in Beatles Land--then you will enjoy it.
0440237688|5.0|Lois Lowry is definatley a great writer, and this book proves it. Even though The Giver, the title of the book, refers to the Giver that Jonas works with, the book is more so about Jonas, which isn't found in any of her other books. Jonas's community is a perfect community. It's a community where there is no violence, there are no arguments, and there is no slang or poor speech. I suppose you could even describe his community as \\"uptight\\". I personally think it fits in the catagory of science fiction, though some may disagree with me. Jonas's community has very strict rules, and some even seem hilarious. Puberty in their community is called \\"stirrings\\". I couldn't help but laugh a little when I read that part, but it didn't make me take the book any less seriously. The Giver gives Jonas the memorys of the past that aren't found in their community. The Giver is growing old, and someone needs to take over. So, a new \\"receiver\\" is chosen. The Old, as the elderly are called, monitor what the children do during their volounteer hours. Jonas never focused on one particular thing, which made him perfect for the assignment. The previous receiver was The Giver's daughter, but his daughter could not take the stress of all the memorys, so she decided is was best that she was released. Release, as we find out later, is when they stick a needle in a person's arm and they, well, die.<br /><br />I definately reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a deep and very, very interesting read. You won't be dissapointed!
B000062YB1|5.0|This album showcases the best of Slayer, combining the speed and brutality of \\"Reign in Blood\\" with the melodies of \\"South of Heaven\\". I believe that it also showcases their best songwriting, highlighted by \\"War Ensemble\\", \\"Spirit in Black\\", \\"Dead Skin Mask\\", and the title track. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman have rarely sounded better, and Dave Lombardo shines throughout. 5 stars.
B000E97Y6A|4.0|Peter Jackson's King Kong is a beautifully rendered version of the original movie. The special efects are fantastic, and the relationship between Kong and Naomi Watts is truly touching. <br /> <br />Yes, it is much too slow at the start. Jackson spends way too much time building up the charaters of Naomi Watts and Jack Black. He could have cut that down to about 15 minutes without hurting the overall movie. <br /> <br />But once you get to the island with Kong, the movie is a visual delight. It is a much better homage to the original than the pathetic attempt by Dino De Laurentis in the 70t's. <br /> <br />When Kong comes back to New York and escapes from the theater, there is a beautiful scene of him and Naomi Watts ice skating. It's very lovely and adds a whole new dimension to their relationship.  <br /> <br />Even though you know what happens in the end, you still find yourself rooting for Kong. Once again, it has a sad ending, with the exact same words as were spoken at the end of the original- \\"Twas beauty that killed the beast.\\"
B0007Y08QA|4.0|The music cues, some of the camera work, camera shots, etc are very reminiscent of Hitchcock's work, and that lends a lot to this film.<br /><br />This film combines a lot of things I liked in other films, like \\"Fight Club\\", \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", assorted Hitchcock films, etc.<br /><br />We all have seen and heard of actors gaining or losing spectacular amounts of weight for a film role, but JEEZY PEEZY!! Bale outdoes them all with this one.
B000EGCITG|4.0|i think that this is a very solid pink album.  i love the stupid girls song and the video is flawless.  she hits all the stupid girls right on the head.  i love the fact that she is all for women empowerment and encouraging girls to be pres and tomboys.  more girls should be, i cant stand all the fake pouting and whining and crying all the time, and pink strikes me as a girl that would not be that way and for that she rocks.  another real stand out track is the one about the president.  it is a very bold song and one that makes excellent and valid points.  kudos to pink and the indigo girls for having the audacity to put out such a poingnant song.  the other song that i absolutely love is the leave me alone song.  i love the beat the song....ok everything about the song.  i think that it rocks and i can totally jam out to it.  the U + UR Hand song is hilarious and i cannot wait for that ont to come on the radio.  i love pink because i see her as a boundary pusher and is good for young girls trying to discover who they are and where they belong.  no pink is not dead and i never thought that she was.  her last album was awesome and deserved more attention.  it was more of a rock album but it was still awesome.  hopefully pink will have a great hit with this album and we will continue to hear excellent punk/pop music from her in the future.
B000009F3Z|5.0|Yes, this is the album that defined the so-called \\"Gothenburg Sound\\", by its greatest practitioners IMHO. \\"Punish My Heaven\\", \\"Edensong\\", \\"Lethe\\", and \\"..Of Melancholy Burning\\" are all classics, mixing intense melodies with frenetic death metal rhythms. Without Dark Tranquillity, there would be no so-called \\"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\\". Along with In Flames, Dark Tranquillity are amongst the two original purveyors of melodic death metal that are arguably still relevant, and unquestionably still producing great music (though personally, I am more partial to DT). Definitely a must-buy classic album.
B00005JO20|1.0|News Flash! Not everyone who goes and sees a remake of a movie has seen the original. First of all, I'm in totally agony, I have appendicitis. I have a dull pain near my navel area and it becomes sharp as I touch my lower right abdomen. I have a loss of appetite (yes, I couldn't even have buttered popcorn because of my appendicitis) and I'm cramping like crazy. But what better, than to try and get my mind off it by watching a great movie. So I get there 45 minutes early so I can get a great seat. Then these middle aged couple strolls in and sits right behind me. At first they were commenting about how his mother is getting so old and what old folks home they should put the guy's mother in but no, they couldn't continue talking about that. No, they had to then talk about the whole plot of the film. \\"Hey Barbara (girlfriend), I can't wait to see the part where King Kong falls off the Empire State Building and dies.\\" I just sat there, dumbfounded. The guy just ruined the whole movie for me. I'm thinking, the film's completely lost its luster for me. If it wasn't for the intense stabbing pains from my appendicitis I would have left right then and there.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a dream is an amazing look at the development of drug addictions. Unfortunatly, these problems occur as a result of people trying to accomplish their dreams through the use of drugs. <br />Although the story line in this movie may appear to be slow, Aronofsky is careful not to rush to the ending that the entire movie builds up for. He allows plenty of time for the characters and their respective problems to develop, which is all presented at the perfect pace- starting as petty and getting progressively worse. The character development is something overlooked but mandatory in a movie such as this. <br />I must give specific mention to the music too. The music is the perfect compliment to the specific scenes and really displays the attitude of the scene as well. <br />Overall, this movie is very depressing becuase it doesnt hold anything back and is made more depressing by the fact that incidents such as these are all too common.
0553801503|3.0|it's hard writing about this book.  i, like, many others waited a long time and were teased with chapters on martin's website.  quite frankly, this whole book is basically a teaser.  it introduces new characters to make up for the absences of our favorites and only introduces new questions.  which, of course, only prolongs the wait.  it will be a quick read, for all those pages, there isn't a whole lot happening.  now, we're back to waiting for book 5.
B00005JO20|4.0|Peter Jackson's loving and overbloated tribute to one of the greatest films of all time.  I was eagerly anticipating the release of this film.  I really liked parts of it.  Most of the scenes with Kong are amazing.  So lifelife and so much emotion from the character.  Attention to detail (you can see every hair on the gorilla, the lighting on Kong during the Tyrannasaurus batte in the vines)is on the spot. <br /> <br />I only wish the actors were as animated.  Jack Black is all wrong for Carl Denham.  Too young and too demented looking, not a very good actor either.  Thought that Jason Alexander or Nathan Lane would have made a better Denham. They have the ability to play a lovable con man and are so much more theatrical.  Adrien Brody as a playwright?  Why change him from a sailor to a playwright?  Makes no impact on the story whatsoever.  He seems to know from the start that she only has eyes for someone else (big & furry).  <br /> <br />The movie could have been trimmed down.  Shorten the boat trip to 15 minutes.  Lose the scene where Driscoll mistily watches his play and moons over Ann Darrow. <br /> <br />A little more realistic outcomes would make it a better flick too.  Kong battles 3 T-Rexes, swapping Ann from hand to foot rather violently.  She falls very far from on top of a dinosaur's head, mind you, and is unscathed. Not a scratch on her.  Clothing looked pretty good too.  On top of the Empire State building Ann is clad in a little white slip of a dress and doesn't seem to be cold at all - in the winter time.  Maybe it's that big fur coat that keeps her warm? <br /> <br />Anyway, loved Kong. Could watch his scenes over and over.  Best special effects I have ever seen in a film.  I'm a stickler for them. So disappointed in most flicks of late.  Dark, fast monsters that you can't even see.  Usually apppear at night or during a rainstorm.  Not Kong - resplendant in the brilliant sunlight. Amazing
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Well i guess the trailors actually showed the best parts to this film.. There was no real story line around it at all just a lot of blood and body parts :S <br />I actually wanted to leave its a pointless film thats meant to be a take off of \\"Saw\\".. Well sadly to say... Saw comes out tops out of them both =]
B000E97HIA|5.0|I've been a fan of Prince for as long as I can remember.  His musical genius, though often misunderstood, was never lost on me...the man is an innovator, not a follower like most musicians.  Such is the case with the newest offering which I find has the perfect blend of funk, soul, spirituality and sensuality....all trademarks of Prince and his ever-changing style.  I highly recommend this CD to any true Prince fan, as it will be a valuable addition to your collection.   <br />From the funk/soul of 'Lolita', 'Black Sweat' and 'Get on the Boat', to the sensuality of 'Incense and Candles' and 'Satisfied', to the spirituality of 'Beautiful, Loved and Blessed', you are sure to enjoy the ride that Prince takes you on with this CD.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Stupid Keanu Reeves horror film that is as bad as the word of mouth people has been giving it. Keanu was miscast and he gives a very tired performance with a one-note character. The script itself is so poorly written that you will be astounded by some of the dialog that is spoken by the characters in this film and the plot really does not make a lot of sense once you try to put two and two together. Rachel Weisz does in fact give a riveting and haunting performance but she's the only actor in the film who dares to give one while the rest of the actors in the film fall flat on their faces with their one dimensional characters. (Peter Stormare does do well in his small but pivotal role but he's only in the movie for about three to four minutes) The visual effects are a let down compared to the films that have come out recently in the cinema and they get repetitive after a while. The direction is a joke with certain scenes that are shot so poorly that you have no idea on what is going on from scene to scene. A better director would have tried to make some sense on what was happening but this director only adds to the confusion that is already in the script. If you like to make fun of bad movies, then this movie is for you because other than Weisz's gutsy and complex performance, the movie has nothing to offer in the form of real entertainment  <br /> <br />
B000002BFZ|1.0|i'm a big Pearl Jam Fan, but this is their worst album.  Not one good song on the Cd. Don't waste your time with this one. Not one good song on it.
B0009SS00A|4.0|Digital Fortress is yet another wonderful mystery novel by Dan Brown. Although not as Da Vinci Code-esque, Digital Fortress has characters that turn out to be characters that weren't actually characters. It's full of backstabbing, high-speeding, mass-gunning, your run-of-the-mill Dan Brown book. Unlike the Da Vinci Code, Digital Fortress has a slight difference, it has no puzzles for you to solve, let alone the puzzle of finding who is who. Yes, Greg Hale, a flirtatious cryptographer with something floating about him, the book does good to make him look bad, subtly. As I had previously read the Da Vinci Code, it seemed obvious that he was an antagonist and codename North Dakota. However, Brown proves himself to be unpredictable, and Hale becomes \\"just a minor character.\\" Take Teabing, for example. He looked good, he helped. And then, out of the blue, \\"WTF IZ TEABING TEH TEECHER? Z0MFGONOS!11!!\\"<br /><br />Anyone who thought Da Vinci Code was too confusing will like it, because of its simplicity. Anyone who read Da Vinci Code who thought it was a worthy challenge will like it, it looks easy at first but slaps you later. Inna wossname, the wossname, the face. After a coupla chapters meself, I said, \\"Dur. The ring is the key. Dur.\\" Surprise surprise. It didn't hit me till the end of the book.<br /><br />Although many acts of senseless violence plague the book, the plot itself is worth reading. Several people will not like it because of that, but as a reader it's fine. It only happened in the book.
B000005RQT|4.0|This album is everything a headbanger album should be. It is raw, simplistic, sludgy and powerful. It pounds your head into the ground like a battering ram. What it lacks in sublety and finesse it makes up for in raw power. Oh, there are some moments of finesse, such as in the guitar solo in Child In Time. But more often than not, it leaves the senses bloody, battered and bruised. I think that more than any other Blackmore-era Deep Purple album the individual contibutions of ALL the band members are allowed to be heard here. Usually Blackmore and Lord steal the show, with Ian Paice not far behind, with Roger Glover's bass playing and Ian Gillan's vocals taking a backseat. But here, Roger Glover's diversified bass lines, whether they be melodic, hard driving, or simply powerful and thumping, are very noticeably contributive to the overall sound and Ian Gillan's vocals are the best of on any Deep Purple album. Combine this with the usual ferocious drumming of Ian Paice and Blackmore's and Lord's usual wizardries, and you have the makings of a powerful and historic effort from this influential band. Especially noteworthy are Blackmore's solo on Child in Time and Lord's maniacal, wild soloing on Flight Of The Rat, while on Hard Loving Man the entire group together take us on a descent into chaotic madness. This album proves the old cliche that the total is more than the sum of its parts. On the 25th Anniversary Edition, especially striking are Jam Stew and the extended, unedited, remixed version of Black Night, both of which prominently feature Blackmore's distinctive style of frenetic soling that will leave Blackmore fans with a huge smile on their collective faces. I really like the piano version of Speed King also, perhaps more than the original version. This album came out on vinyl in 1970. Even after all these years, the album holds up well, especially compared to all the junk masquerading as rock music these days. While this is not Purple's most refined or polished effort, it remains a true document of the intensity and power that became a trademark of their sound throughout the 1970s and beyond.
B000EGCITG|4.0|Where to begin? Pink's new album I'm Not Dead is for vocalizations and subject matter what panoramic views are to cinema. She goes all over the place musically, her voice hitting high points on rock, pop, folk, and R&B cuts. <br />Personal favorites include the rockers \\"Long Way To Happy\\"  (is this Kelly Clarkson or Pink?),  and \\"U + UR Hand\\" which harkens back to a Pat-Benatar-esque sound,  the satirically intellgent and funny first single \\"Stupid Girl,\\" and the pop and rock mix of \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\". <br />She does give her R&B beginnings due in tracks like \\"I Got Money Now\\" the moving ballad \\"Nobody Knows\\" <br />She deals with social commentary on tracks like the rock/pop \\"Runaway\\" and the folk-influenced duet featuring the Indigo Girls, \\"Dear Mr. President\\", a track instead of being scathingly offensive comes across as justifiably questioning.  <br />She works in her own world of poking fun at the mainstream media with the aforementioned \\"Stupid Girl\\" and the tongue in cheek \\"I Got Money Now\\" and the punk/dance marathon of \\"Cuz I Can\\".  Also she takes on her own possible media demise from the relative failure that was her last album on the rock-out title track, which goes deeper than that, but gives the album a great title to let her fans and detractors know she is back and better than ever.  <br />Pink is also not afraid to take on issues of depression, lost love and instrospections about a person's fears of committment or being alone with the previously said \\"Long Way To Happy\\" and \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely).\\" <br />Most of these songs could find a home on the radio with some editing in the lyrics. Pink does tend to rely on a certain curse word that starts with \\"f\\" quite a bit, to the point of being on almost every track, which is why this is a four star instead of five star album. We get that she's got angst, and she comes across intellegently otherwise, why the need to throw in this word throughout?  <br />It's a shame that my favorite song on the album won't ever make it on radio if released. U + UR Hand, a song about a guy trying to pick up girls at a bar and being unsucessful, leading to, well, the song's title, is funny but a bit too obvious for most radio stations to play.
B000002I27|5.0|Seriously, do you need to hype up one of the legendary figureheads of the Classic Rock era? Jim Morrison's voice drove the 4 man crew to heights of superstardom few artists back then would acheive. This Doors release reminds me of why I really abhor greatest hits albums, as they omit a lot of the more unheralded songs of an artists catalog. Songs like \\"Unhappy Girl\\" and \\"I Can't See Your Face In My Mind\\", utterly fantastic songs, usually don't get a lot of mention when discussing the Door's music. A comparitively \\"mellower\\" album, \\"Strange Days\\", probably more than a lot of their other releases, highlights Jim Morrison's writing and poetic slant prominently. Outside of that, this album contains one of my top 3 Doors songs in \\"When The Music's Over\\". Please don't sleep on Kreiger, Manzarek, and Densmore's contributions to this album, as they reach an almost \\"Coltranish\\" synergy at times reminding me of the cohesiveness of the classic JC quartet with Garrison, Tyner, and Jones. Telling, since both released such a strong but limited amount of music. This is classic Doors in every sense.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album always produces very differing opinions amongst Metallica fans. Some say it was their best work, some say it signalled the band entering a downward spiral and heading into the mainstream. Some fans turned against the band altogether after they released 'the video they said they would never make' for the song 'One'. Lots of question marks hang over the quality of production on this record. The guitars sound very over-processed, Lars' bass drums convey more of a click sound than the thump we are used to hearing. However, the main source of discussion is the distinct absence of Jason Newsted's bass. Those who know Metallica will know that Newsted was a new addition to the band for this record; previous bassist Cliff Burton died shortly after the recording of 'Master Of Puppets'. But if you were to listen to '...And Justice For All', you wouldn't have thought that Metallica had even found a replacement as the bass is buried so deep beneath the guitars that it is almost unrecogniseable. Some of the songs contain such complex tempo changes and disjointed rhythms that the band found it particularly hard to replicate any of them on stage. The tracks are much longer than ever before, two of them are over 9 minutes long and only two are less than 6 minutes long. However, all this aside...I still believe this to be Metallica's greatest album to date. <br /> <br />The album opens with 'Blackened', and an atmospheric opening which was actually recorded backwards. After the build-up, James Hetfield displays the song's main riff before Lars Ulrich comes in with a lightning-fast drumbeat. Kirk Hammett's solo in this one is also guaranteed to impress. The title track then follows. This epic is almost ten minutes long and the lyrics are the key focus here; James Hetfield lets his feelings be expressed regarding America's judicial system. 'One' is the highlight of the album and a music video was released for it in the following year. It starts with a clean guitar intro, which builds up throughout the song and eventually transforms into an onslaught of thrash metal for the last couple of minutes. The concept is haunting in this track. Hetfield sings about a solider who is bombed in the war and loses all of his senses but can still feel the pain as he is kept on a life support machine. Ulrich's machine gun drumming is absolutely stunning, Hetfield's vocals are overwhelmingly passionate and Kirk Hammett's atmospheric guitar solo is voted the 7th best of all time. In comparison, the following three tracks can become slightly boring...but all the passion of the album is regained in the instrumental track 'To Live Is To Die'. This song was written as a tribute to former bassist Cliff Burton; a poem that he wrote is spoken by Hetfield towards the end of the song. The middle section is probably one of the most emotional things I have ever heard...Hetfield's guitar solo is extremely heartfelt. Then the atmospheric melody kicks in which builds and builds until the song returns to its original riff and the poem is spoken. Perhaps this represents the band's journey from complete agony and despair, to picking themselves back up and surging on just as Cliff would have wanted them to. If Cliff could have heard this, he would have been proud...it is very reminiscent of the track 'Orion' from Master Of Puppets. The last track, 'Dyers Eve' is the fastest song on the album and contains some of the best lyrics ever written by frontman Hetfield as he tells the painful story of his childhood, and cries out for his parents' guidance: \\"I'm in hell without you, cannot cope without you two...shocked at the world that I see, innocent victim please rescue me...\\" <br /> <br />I had the chance to listen to this album all the way through for the first time in a while recently, and it inspired me to write a review about it. It is, in my opinion, the greatest collection of songs ever released, and if you haven't heard it then you must buy it and give it a listen because nothing, absolute nothing beats it. This album is why Metallica are the greatest band of all time.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|Plain and Simple. <br /> <br />On par with his first album, Van Hunt expands his sound and puts his playful funky rocker side on display with phenomenal results.

B000BUE5DM|3.0|RUST IN PEACE, meiner Meinung nach die geilste aller Megadeth Scheiben. aber was Megadave sich bei diesem Re-Release gedacht hat, keine Ahnung. Nicht nur, da&szlig; in fast jeden Track neue Backing Vocals und Instrumentals beigemischt worden, sowohl &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; als auch &quot;Five Magics&quot; wurden komplett neu eingesungen. Wieso?? die Originalversionen killen ohne ende und diese Erneuerung nimmt nicht nur den Charme der alten Tracks sondern auch gleichzeitig die Vocalm&auml;ssige Aggressivit&auml;t, da es viel softer gesungen wird.<br />F&uuml;r alle, die dieses Hammeralbum nicht kennen, holt euch auf JEDEN FALL die Originalversion, welche noch nicht remastered ist und die Songs im Original beinhaltet!<br />Fazit: Hammeralbum, aber nur in der Originalversion!
630307362X|4.0|I found this movie disturbing and parts of it left me amazed to say the least. Set in the mid-nineteenth century, it gives one a good impression of life in the rugged forests of New Zealand's South Island and the natives living there at that time. But, from the beginning there is trouble: Ada's father arranges her a marriage to a man she has never met. Then, when she meets Alisdair Stewart, they DO NOT connect--especially since he denies her, her beloved piano. This sets off a chain of events, as the piano is the key to unlocking Ada's heart. Leave it to her husband's strange neighbor George Baines (Harvey Keitel) -and his superb acting I might add-even in the buff; to unlock her soul. A pity it is though that Ada's husband Stewart (Sam Neill) drove her to sell herself to George in order to get the piano back.<br /><br />Like Ada the mute, I too would have found life on the South Island distressing-all the muck and mire and remoteness. I would have hated it and also would have become disillusioned. Yes, what she did was wrong-falling for George the way she did. But, her daughter Flora was despicable, feeding into Stewart's rage. Stewart was a violent, abusive, heartless man and his behavior was inexcusable-- from the moment he denied Ada her piano. The only redemption here is that later Stewart heard Ada's 'inner voice' speak and came to his senses.<br /><br />Here is another fluke: Ada left her native Scotland? You could have fooled me! The accents of George, Ada and Flora, fake as they were, sounded as if they originated from Ireland. The natives were the only actors not guilty of fakery and they were very convincing. Many of them I give credit to in fact, since they saved Ada from the sea.<br /><br />As a fellow pianist, I found the piano music as beautiful as the piano itself. Was that Holly Hunter playing? It appeared that way. I felt Ada's pain when she released the piano from the canoe, to the sea. The climax of the movie though-left me a bit confused. Did Ada drown in the ocean with her piano? Or did her and George, as I hope, live happily ever after? I am led to believe that the natives DID save her, and that the beautiful white house, George's kisses, Ada's gorgeous gown, earrings, as well as her metal finger George crafted since Stewart cut the other one off; were all real. So, if it was a happy ending for George, Ada, and Flora, yippee! Still, due to the plot and confusing ending, I could not give this movie 5 stars.ocean with her piano?

B0007RT9LM|3.0|Coyote Ugly is a weak movie in some ways.  The plot is very simple and also very unoriginal.  Violet, a young woman, leaves home, without the approval of her overprotective, widowed father, and goes to New York to pursue a songwriting career and try to make it on her own.  To make ends meet in the meantime, she takes a job as a barmaid. She meets a guy who becomes her love interest.  This whole plot could be summed in 30 minutes or less.  The thing that stretches out the movie and makes it fun to watch is the music (an awesome soundtrack) and the wild antics that go on at the bar where Violet works. <br /> <br />Fact is, Coyote Ugly isn't your average, ordinary, everyday bar.  The barmaids dance on the bar, pour drinks on themselves and each other, spray customers with water,  and outrageously flirt with the male customers.  This is what makes the movie. <br /> <br />I must say that much of the movie is unbelievable.  By some miracle, Violet manages to make it as a songwriter after singing one song in one club.  Also by some miracle, her father (charmingly played by John Goodman, I must add) does a total turnaround from sternly disapproving of her working in a bar to dancing on the bar himself.  Violet's problem with extreme stage fright is also unconvincing.  However, Coyote Ugly is worth watching for the great music and the dancing and other wild things that go in the bar.
B00006690G|1.0|Who is this young man? I want to speak to this boy's parents! Who does he think he is, talking about killing, and sex, and all that stuff at such a young age? In my day, if you were caught saying something like that, I believe you'd get your a$$ kicked! I believe you'd get yourself shot! Back then, we didn't have any time-outs like you people do today, oh no, we didn't get no time-out, no, you know what we had? We had a little thing called \\"KNOCK OUT.\\" We had a little thing called \\"a bullet to the head\\" and a \\"guillotine.\\" And all you kids today just take everything for granted. When I was a kid, we had to WORK down in the mines if we wanted food. And if we didn't work hard enough, we didn't get anything! Even if we spent the entire day down there. And when we didn't get anything, we sat on the streets and begged! And when someone would spit on the ground and tell us to lick it up, we LICKED IT UP!!! And we respected them DANG IT! You see, in my day, we didn't have air conditioning, or TVs, or refrigerators to keep our food all fresh, or microwaves to make our food all nice and warm for us, and couches that magically fold out into beds, and practically serve dinner to you, and fly you around the room, and tell you stories! Heck, I don't even think we had a couch! And all you kids do today is complain. You have it way too easy. I'd like to see one of you kids spend just ONE DAY down in the mines without your precious electricity! HA!
B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens Of The Stone Age is simply the best rock band of the last 10 years. QOTSA has prove once again what rock should suppose to be with this album. The sounds, voices, everything in the album is excepcional. If you want good excellent rock buy this cd.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|Each album stands on it's own as a work of art, but this one is by far their strongest. A real return to the all-guitars rock feel of their first album, and consistent throughout it's entirity. This is a great place to start, or if you're already a Placebo fan, you'll undoubtedly be mulled over by this record.
B000E97HIA|3.0|I was expecting a little more from Prince....hoping to get something that was a little more inspired and consistent.  Instead it was basically three or four songs that were moving and the rest was basically forgettable.  I have listened to the entire CD twice and can't imagine really listening to it much anymore.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Even though it's Josh Homme's fun side project, EODM seems to be Jesse Hughes' life.  This album rocks, with only a few missteps, from start to finish.  The songs are short, raucous, randy (picture Austin Powers saying \\"randy\\"), and completely irrelevant to the great philosophical, psychological, and sociopolitical problems of our day.  It's all good times and winking occult references.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I just want to say that I enjoyed this comedy.<br /><br />That's right... it's a comedy.  Not a horror movie.  It's not supposed to be.  It's supposed to be a mockery of \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\"<br /><br />So, for those of you who watched it and reviewed it based on your hopes of it being a pee-your-pants horor flick, you were very mistaken because that isn't what it is or what it was intended to be.<br /><br />I like all movies, and I also love the movie \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" and this movie was a very funny counterpart.
B00000IPAX|1.0|The thing that turns me off about Blink 182 is the complete and total lack of originality in their songs.  Every song sounds almost exactly the same.  They try to be funny with the lyrics and all, but they fail.  I could find no enjoyment in this album.  Every song has nearly the same guitar and drum beat.  This gets boring quickly. <br /> <br />Don't even remind me of the singing...those guys need some real talent when they sing, and they just don't have it.  They'd easily fail to pass the American Idol tryouts.  Their voices bother me a lot, too.  It sounds like one of them has a pencil stuck in their voicebox.   <br /> <br />I like listening to unique music with good vocals, originality, and lyrics that actually make SENSE.  Blink 182 fails to meet these requirements.as auch nach dem 10ten Durchlauf nicht schlechter wird, einzig das letzte Lied geht mit der Zeit auf die Nerven, aber vielleicht ist das ja nur bei mir so ...!<br />Wer auf hochwertigen Melodic-Power Metal steht, MUSS dieses Album haben!:-)
0195067142|5.0|This book is the only one I have found that comes close to explaining why my father, a marine veteran from 1939 to 1945 and four major campaigns in the Pacific including Okinawa, could not bring himself to talk about the war for the 60 years he lived after the war.<br /><br />Mr. Sledge describes the horror of the experience and the incredible bravery of the frontline United States Marines in the Pacific in World War II like no other book I have read.<br /><br />Read this and you will come to understand the words; 'Uncommon Valor became a Common Virtue'.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|This is a must see. You won't regret it. My son and I enjoy this movie, over and over again compared to any other movies he owns. Except, maybe Harry Potter. He's 7, I'm 29.strikte Einteilung der Welt kann ganz gut funktionieren, wenn man einen Film/ein Buch/ein Comic als reinen &bdquo;Western\\" (schwarze Hüte, weiße Hüte, alles klar) betrachtet - mit einer humorvollen Distanz. <br />Die blieb mir aber buchstäblich im Hals stecken, als eine der &bdquo;guten\\" Personen eine andere Person über Wochen hinweg foltert - und zwar, wie sie dann glaubhaft versichert, zu derem Besten. Eine Art Schocktherapie soll es sein, und das funktioniert auch, denn die gefolterte Person versteht, dass die Folter ihr &bdquo;geholfen\\" hat, ihre Angst zu verlieren und bedankt sich dafür bei ihrem &bdquo;Retter\\". Sie bedankt sich tatsächlich für wochenlange Todesangst und körperliche Misshandlungen. Aua. Comic und ironische Distanz hin oder her - aber das ging mir persönlich zu weit. Viel zu weit sogar. Die Botschaft finde ich einfach nur bedenklich. Sie erscheint mir wie die kranke Logik à la &bdquo;die Schläge sind nur zu deinem Besten, mein Kind. Sie tun mir mehr weh als dir, denn ich liebe dich\\". Folter aus gutem Grund ist gesund? Foltern ist ok, solange man zu den Guten gehört? Folter als Liebesdienst? <br />Schade, denn im Grunde hätte es ein schöner Film mit starken Bildern werden können - wenn diese Message nicht so bedenklich wäre. 3 Punkte trotzdem für die schauspielerische Leistung, für die Bildregie und die Spannung.
B000CNDIZE|4.0|You always feel a little behind-the-pack when you first hear an album 2 years after it's intial release. Concordantly, you feel like a bigger tool when you review an album 2 years after it's initial release. That, however, is precisely what I am doing. In my defense, the album wasn't released in the United States until January 10, 2006. I think there's a good 4 month window where it is appropriate to review a piece of work and I generally follow that rule of thumb. So, seeing as how I have never been outside of the United States of America, I finde it more than appropriate to review Sia's 2004 album \\"Colour the Small One.\\"<br /><br />Disclaimers aside, this is a beautiful album. Being, as the Europeans would say, a narrow-minded American, you have probably never become acquainted with Sia, at least in the personal sense. Fans of the group Zero 7 can immediately distinguish her voice as a frequent guest vocalist for the group, including the song \\"In the Waiting Line\\" from the Garden State soundtrack. Her voice is soft, intimate, and painful. A random assortment of adjectives, yes, but it accurately depicts the heart and soul of this album.<br /><br />At first listen, you'll love it. This is not a stretch. But listen to it again, focus on the lyrics and you'll be entering Sia's world, where her most intimate thoughts and emotions are revealed. It's a refreshing experience, but at the same time, a frightening one. So rarely does an artist open up and become frank with her audience. It's as if Fiona Apple softened her voice and made an entire album of the song \\"Parting Gift.\\"<br /><br />Sia begins the album by proclaiming \\"You don't know me/You can't hold me/I'll slip through your hands/I am one single grain of sand.\\" However, by the end of the album you'll feel as if you know her better than herself, and in truth, you just might. Indeed, with tracks like \\"Natale's Song,\\" it's hard not to feel like you've known this girl for years (\\"She barely speaks/But I hear her breathing/That's all I need...Momentarily, she brings peace to me\\").<br /><br />\\"Colour the Small One\\" is best summed up as Sia beautifully sings \\"I can't detach from the past and all of the pain/I need to learn, start from scratch begin again.\\" As you listen to this album you realize what a cathartic experience this must have been for the artist. Though she makes herself immensly vulnerable, it is particularly comforting to know that when it's all said and done, she has grown as a person and as an artist. As listeners, we can only thank her for letting us all partake in that experience.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Tori Amos and Feist. Don't pass up this album.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br /><br />1. \\"The Bully\\"<br /><br />2. \\"Natale's Song\\"<br /><br />3. \\"The Church of What's Happening Now\\"<br /><br />4. \\"Where I Belong\\"<br /><br />4 out of 5 Starser breathing/That's all I need...Momentarily, she brings peace to me\\"). <br /> <br />\\"Colour the Small One\\" is best summed up as Sia beautifully sings \\"I can't detach from the past and all of the pain/I need to learn, start from scratch begin again.\\" As you listen to this album you realize what a cathartic experience this must have been for the artist.

It is not dumb and if anything you who doesn't like it is the dumb poop face anus breath.

0060931671|5.0|Easily surpasses almost everything you've ever read!!<br />I love Don DeLillo. I think Jonathan Foer is going to carve out his niche in the next 10 years. Dave Eggers is fun and thought provoking. THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE THOMAS PYNCHON! And this is the book EVERYONE needs to read.<br /><br />I found the book moved slowly at first, but like a perfect mystery, you find that every phrase is a slow unfolding of a much grander scheme. There are simply no wasted words- everything matters. Every plot point will be reflected at a later point and the mystery will deepen with every page. After awhile, you will be convinced that there actually is a major conspiracy afoot going on around you. You will look at America in a way that is very uncomfortable. You will not trust your mailman. You'll look at mailboxes in a different way. You will scour the internet searching for Tristero. You will try to convince yourself over and over again- IT'S JUST A BOOK!!<br /><br />\\"Lot 49\\" is the book for every one of you that has ground their teeth at every suggestion of \\"The DaVinci Code\\". It's the book for everyone who winces at a \\"Bush/Cheney '04\\" sticker. It's the book for everyone who looks over their shoulder when walking for no reason at all but knows there's a reason and it doesn't matter how many times your friends call you paranoid because damn it, you know you're right!<br /><br />I've read most of Pycnhon's books (didn't make it all the way through \\"Mason and Dixon\\"-due to timing, not quality). I am one of the few people on this earth that actually stuck out all 750+ pages of \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\". I have researched and debated much of the works. THIS BOOK is the one I will stand by through heaven and hell.<br /><br />DON'T EVER ANTAGONIZE THE HORN!!<br />You've been warned...
B0002DB0FO|5.0|As the overall quality of mainstream movies declines, television seems to have become the refuge for some of the very best drama.  Everwood is a prime example of this trend.  This series has a superior cast served by excellent writing.  It does occasionally deal with \\"the issues\\" that we have all seen addressed in other family shows many times before. But do not let that fool you.  In very subtle ways, this show revolutionizes the genre.  For example, focusing on a single father is, after all, something that has not often been done before outside of comedies.  Also, for some reason, single dads on TV tend to have daughters exclusively. By contrast, this single dad's relationship with his son is a central theme here.  Locating the action in a small Colorado town (most of the locations are actually in Utah I believe) is also a very clever choice.  It is refreshing to see TV characters in bleak weather wearing clothes that are not meant to be stylish but warm.  And as other reviewers have pointed out, the locations are beautiful and highlighted by the show's unique photography. The storylines are captivating and the depth of characterization is really quite exceptional.  As is often the case with dramas, the dialogue is sometimes so deep that you might be tempted to think \\"No-one talks like that.\\" Maybe.  But the feelings behind the words are real and it is impossible not to identify with them.  I am not the crying type but I have shed some tears watching Everwood.  Because I relate to it and I think most people can.  But there is humor in Everwood as well. Very clever humor at that.  This series is a gem.  Now if they could just release Season 2!  What's the hold-up?
B000063JDE|5.0|David Lynch is not a director that's easily acceptable or digestable to all. He appeals to a select few that share in a particular taste and look for something more challenging than traditional multiplex fare. His films do not allow for passive viewing or popcorn munching- they demand you to be in tune to every stimulus and many hours of thought and conversation after the experience has ended.<br /><br />\\"Blue Velvet\\" is maybe the best of his films for the reason that it's more accesible than \\"Eraserhead\\", better than almost everything else (with \\"Mulholland Drive\\" in contention), and features maybe the greatest villian in movie history.<br /><br />What I love about this movie is that at its core it's very much a love story, though an unconventional one. It's a waking nightmare about obsession. There is a message about heartbreak and longing that \\"The Notebook\\" and \\"Pretty Woman\\" could never come close to touching.<br /><br />The movie is not as strange or inaccessible as people would have you believe. It just doesn't allow for comfortable or lazy viewing.
1400032717|4.0|It took me a while to get around to this in my book pile, but I have to say I enjoyed it immensely.  Sometimes funny, sometimes sad and all very real and honest feeling.  To write such an entertaining novel in a voice so different that you completely understand and empathize with the narrator is a wonderful achievement.  I felt myself thinking differntley about things as the novel progressed and felt like I was a completely different person as I became the narrator.  My one small drawback to the novel is that I was so entralled in the whole thing that I felt the ending was just a little rushed and I wanted more.  A great debut novel!
B000059HAI|4.0|TORA TORA TORA <br />SUMMARY <br />GREAT WW2 FILM SHOWS THE AMERICANS AS THEY ARE ALOAD OF UNORAGNIZED PLEBS
B000002KZ6|3.0|Talking Heads fifth album explored similar material to their masterpiece, the brilliant Remain In Light, but is more influenced by American funk than African pop. This is the first album since 77 without Brian Eno producing and what he added on previous albums, that sense of sonic exploration and density of sound, is sorely missed. As a consequence Speaking in Tongues sounds stripped down, thinner than its amazing predecessor Remain In Light and far less interesting. Speaking In Tongues seems to be a step sideways rather than forwards and though it's enjoyable, it's far from the groundbreaking music I'd come to expect from the Heads. There are some very good songs on Speaking In Tongues such as Girlfriend Is Better, or This Must Be The Place, but many of the songs seem half baked, and when compared to Remain In Light sound like demo tracks. You can blame Eno's absence, his production and musicianship might have pushed Talking Heads over the edge into more creative territory. But the fault lies primarily with the songs themselves: that wacky spark of originality usually found in their music is largely missing. The material simply doesn't measure up to the high standards previously set by Talking Heads, neither musically, nor lyrically. Speaking In Tongues is actually a fun listen, but for me was a letdown. The band seem content to merely entertain rather than innovate, with the consequence being that Speaking In Tongues was the first Talking Heads recording that could be considered almost ordinary.g. Das heißt man muss schon dafür was tun.<p>(* * * * *)<p>PUNKTESYSTEM<p>Am Punktesystem hat sich nicht viel getan, es ist immer noch das gleiche wie in SWAT 4 (was ich ziemlich schlecht finde). So werden immer noch Strafpunkte angerechnet wenn ein bewaffneter Täter erschossen wird (sollte er nicht auf Sie geschossen haben). Aber durch das neue Waffensystem kann so was verhindert werden da es mehr NICHTTÖTLICHE WAFFEN gibt.<p>(* * *)<p>EINZELHEITEN<p>Grafik:<p>An der Grafik hat sich gegenüber SWAT 4 nicht viel getan. Diese ist aber trotzdem noch immer schön und kann so manches Spiel aus der heutigen Zeit Toppen. 5/5<p>Physik:<p>Die &bdquo;Havok Physik Engine\\" ist zwar schön anzusehen da ihnen während des Gefechtes, in Beispielsweise einer Küche, die Töpfe um die Ohren fliegen. Aber dass die Entwickler es immer noch nicht geschafft haben, dass man die Möglichkeit hat, durch Türen zu schießen ist mir ein Rätsel. Das einzige wo sich hindurch Schiessen lässt sind dünne Vorhänge oder Trennwände. 4/5 <p>Speichern:<p>Das ist das demotivierenste überhaupt im Spiel, man kann nicht Speichern. Ich will damit nicht sagen dass es unbedingt schlecht ist aber einmal darf ja wohl erlaubt sein. So kommt es des Öfteren vor, das man kurz nach Missionsende niedergestreckt wird und von neu anfangen muss. Das ist wirklich kein Spaß auf Dauer! 1/5<p>Fazit: <p>Am AddOn hat sich eine Menge geändert und das ist auch gut so. Aber so ganz Fehlerfrei war es dann doch nicht. Aber Grund genug zum Spielen, sind die guten Waffen, die sauberen Missionen die Motivation neues zu bekommen &amp; die Intelligenten Gegner die immer für eine Überraschung gut sind. Leider ist dies nur ein AddOn aber wer SWAT 4 schon mochte wird hier keine Probleme haben und kann sich das AddOn auf alle Fälle zulegen.
B000EGCIU0|5.0|Pink's new CD, \\"I'm Not Dead,\\" is her best album to date.  With having left L.A. Reid she is now on her own, and sounding better than ever.  We here some typical hardcore Pink, and a tender, more soft Pink as well.  She has great rock influenced song such as 'Stupid Girls,' 'U+Ur Hand,' and ''Cuz I Can.'  But Pinks slow songs a just as powerful and I feel that one of those, 'I Have Seen the Rain' (featuring her father), is the best track on the album.  An excellent buy!!
B00000IBRI|5.0|\\"Phenomena\\" is my personal favourite Argento film. It has practically all the elements that form other movies of Italian maestro: boarding school for girls, mysterious murderer, dreamy atmosphere, beautiful music (although I thought the soundtrack could do easily without Iron Maiden and Motorhead), hidden rooms and passages in the houses, some unexpected and unthinkable plot lines, like Jennifer Connely's character being able to communicate with insects...<br /><br />It's difficult, maybe even impossible to explain the beauty of Argento's pictures. I think whether you see it or not. It's like whether you love fantasy genre or not. \\"Phenomena\\" is extremely picturesque, enchanting and dark if you get into Argento's work. If you don't I guess you wouldn't be reading this. So if you enjoyed his other films like \\"Opera\\", \\"Inferno\\" or \\"Suspiria\\" you'll get a lot of pleasure watching this one.<br /><br />Now a few words about editions: there are about 15 different releases of different countries, and Anchor Bay one is rather good - it has commentaries and some extra features. But my pick is German 2-disc limited edition by \\"Dragon entertainment\\". It has loads of extras and some additional dialog sequences missing in AB release. This edition is rather hard to find nowdays. But if you're a die-hard fan you might have your ways...
B00000K3D4|3.0|The only reason, I have to admit, I borrowed this film from the video store was David Bowie. Watching David Bowie act (and I don't mean his posturing gesticulations as Ziggy Stardust, or all the other half-baked characters of his) was too much to pass off.  <br /> <br />On the whole, the premise of the film seems simple enough. Young, troubled teenage girl is disillusioned and disatisfied with the real world, and wants to escape to a fantasy realm (don't we all). When she accidentally wishes her baby brother away to the Goblin Kingdom she find she has but thirteen hours to navigate a vast maze - a 'Labyrith' to get the baby from the clasp of Bowie's Goblin King. <br /> <br />Of course, she goes through many adventures and of course suceeds. The film's main strength are the memorable puppets; notably an irritating chatty fox and a goblin-like character.  <br /> <br />And now to the not so good. First of all, I found the film a little on the cheesy side. I don't know it was aimed more at kids, but there was an overhwhelming 80s camp about it; put it down to the upbeat songs and Bowie's less than convincing dancing, rocking villain.  <br /> <br />Then there was the acting. The main character, Sarah, is played by Jennifer Connely who. I don't know, but at times I thought her acting a little inconsistent. For example the first bit when is it frustrated with life and all. Watch it and you'll see what I mean. Bowie is another matter; like some cheapo charicature villain, he is both staid, banal and lifeless in all respects. Enough said. The creatures too are a bit annoying. <br /> <br />Overall, it's fun for one watch but is a bit overlong (should have been in the 90min range), and the story a bit tenuous. The Neverending Story, similar in many respects (as well as being released around the same time) is probably superior in most respects, as well as working on a pure fantasy level.
B000059PPN|4.0|I remember watching \\"House by the Cemetery\\" about 10 or 12 years ago and remember always considering it the best work of Lucio Fulci. A couple of days back I watched it again and although it seemed to be rather stupid and simple I still think it's Fulci's best. Sure it's freaky sometimes: where have you seen mansions standing in the middle of a cemetery? When the housekeeper rubs away a giant blood stain on the floor, woman who lives in the house doesn't come up with idea to ask where this stain came from(!). The couple's kid acts strange and totally unbelievable. There's a pile of cadavers kept in the basement and no one notices it for a long time... Anyway there are plenty inadequacies whatsoever in the movie. But still it looks good. Maybe because these misdoings are so downright and bold. If we take all the mishaps for granted (and it's the way most of Italian horror should be seen) \\"House by the Cemetery\\" looks fine and even better than all flicks of this kind - I mean haunted house flicks. But here we get clear explanation in the end again unlike in many other movies. Besides \\"House\\" can boast of having excellent score hence perfect horror atmosphere.<br />Shot right after \\"The Beyond\\" and a year before \\"New York Ripper\\", \\"House by the Cemetery\\" to my opinion stays one of the best Lucio Fulci's works. I guess you'll hate it if you are not a horror fan, but if you are you must have this cult classic in your collection.

0345350499|5.0|I have read this book- and I say this in all seriousness- close to 100 times in the last 4 years. The first time I read it, I finished the whole novel in two days because I simply could not stop. I read so many copies to tatters, my boyfriend finally bought me a hardcover copy (very hard to find nowadays for this book) for Christmas. <br /> <br />This was the first novel on the Arthurian period I ever read, and that because it was recommended by a friend who'd had yet to do me wrong by suggesting any book. I was hooked by the end of the first chapter, and now I am not only a huge fan of Marion Zimmer Bradley's other books, but of anything I can get my hands on about the days of King Arthur. The stories of Morgan Le Fay are of particular interest to me, and she, not Arthur, is the major player in Mists. <br /> <br />This book is not about telling everyone the tales of the round table they already know- about the quest for the Holy Grail, Gwenhwyfar and Lancelet, how the \\"evil sorceress\\" sister of Arthur bore his malicious son, etc. etc. These well-known and well- loved \\"facts\\" are in the book, certainly, and they are still relevant, but the underlying themes here are mainly the roles the many women in the days of Arthur played, and the battle of the newly spawned Christianity vs. the \\"Old Religion\\" that was preserved on Avalon.  <br />there are also more side stories that are not as well known- such as the druid bard Kevin being betrayed by the damsel Nimue (in many stories, it was Merlin- Kevin is rarely found in the literature), the doings of the Bishop Patricius (who we all know as St. Patrick), the lives of the women on Avalon, and Morgaine's life after her forced marriage. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the cheesy movies about Arthur (Excalibur, Merlin, King Arthur, and even the Mists miniseries movie) you will be blown away by this book. If you love this book and haven't seen those movies, don't watch them. They'll make you angry. And if you plan to read the novel, I must advise that you don't watch the movie first, or it will dull your interest.  <br />This book adds a remarkable humanity and realism to the times and the people that surround the tales of Arthur. Arthur is a pushover to his queen, his queen is an adulteress who thinks herself more holy than anyone, Lancelot is arrogant and indecisive, Vivane is power- hungry, Morgause is whorish and downright evil at times, and Morgaine is at times as overly fanatical as Gwenhwyfar but refuses to harbor the suggestion that she might have to compromise to get what she wants. These characters are as human and fallible as you and I, and that often takes the accepted ideas of them passed down for the last 700 years and throws them out the window while still retaining the essence of the legends.  <br /> <br />This is, without exageration, my faveorite book, and has been since I first opened the cover. I have lent it out to many friends, and I would recommend it to anyone of any age, whether you are new to the world of Arthur, as I was, or if you have read every other scrap of literature about that period. I have yet to meet anyone who did not love this book.
B000EQH2QK|5.0|LISTEN EVERYBODY! <br /> <br />Have you been overcome with talk and praise for this album of Shakira's? Is that why you've finally decided to come onto Amazon and check out the reviews or to sample the tracks on this CD? Well your time will not be wasted if you buy this fantastic album! I was not a huge fan of Shakira before...sure I enjoyed some of her hits but I never considered myself a \\"fan\\" of Shakira. Buying this album changed my whole perspective on Shakira. This CD is chock-full of great tracks and songs and some of them blew me away. Timor is by far my favorite track on the album, and I would pay the full price of the CD if it only had this song on it! However, you get 12 more magnificent songs that cause you to shake what your momma gave you and still think about the beautifully sung lyrics that Shakira belts out effortlessy. The lyrics are all written by Shakira and most of the music is also done by her, talk about talent! You don't see Hilary Duff or Britney Spears doing that, do you? Of course not, they lack the authentic singer-songwriter knack that Shakira has! This Arabic-Colombian beauty has given birth to a masterpiece that I will enjoy for years and years to come. Do yourself a favor and get this album, otherwise you are depriving yourself of something that is very wonderful! I was a skeptic, but now I'm a hardcore fan of Shakira because this album is truly one of the best I've bought in a LONG time!
0375831002|5.0|The plot of this book is eloquently outlined in the notes.<br /><br />Death himself is the narrator and we come to know him as well as we want to know him until...<br /><br />He makes the mistake of getting personally involved with the sister of a boy who died enroute to foster parents in Hitler's Germany. Death follows the girl's progress in her life, whom he is fascinated by. Her love of books makes her a book thief in a time where books and outside thinking was not allowed.<br /><br />Zusak's writing is amazing - poetic, flowing. This is not a child's book - it touches you on so many levels. During a time of horror that is remembered by those who had parents/grandparents involved in WWII, to those who haven't (somehow) been touched by that era, this book is magic from cover to cover.

A few months ago I re-read this book and applied the principles properly to find a beautiful and kind women.

B0009UC7H0|4.0|What I loved about this movie was how it had a lot of fighting scenes, but still had fun, loveable charcters too. Steve Zahn had his good share of jokes with Matthew, but Penelope was not very fun. She played a doctor for the W.H.O. and that showed a few grotesk seens. I thought it was pretty cool how the cast got the treasurehunters and the doctor to meet, but some of the plot was hard to follow. For example, you were expected to think an ironclad crossed the ocean. Not likely. Anyway, I enjoyed this movie. If you get Sahara, you will get a few laughs and some cool scences and a above average plot. P.S. If you buy watch the deleted scenes.  Rating: Characters: 10          Plot: 7.5          Graphics: 9
0553456210|1.0|When purchasing audiobooks, I normally follow a simple but very effective rule: never, never, never buy an audiobook read by the author. Even if the author is a talented writer, he/she is invariably a terrible narrator. Always look for audiobooks performed by experienced readers, as in Bryson's own \\"Notes From a Small Island\\" and \\"A Walk in the Woods\\", read by Ron Mclarty. <br /> <br />In Bryson's case I made a rare exception when I listened to \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" - the audio version had received reasonable reviews and his performance was indeed adequately entertaining. For this reason I assumed that \\"Neither Here Nor There\\" would be equally enjoyable. I was wrong. Bryson's deadpan monologue makes it sound as though he was bored out of his mind while reading this book. Passages that may have seemed amusing in the written version are herein delivered in a sleep-inducing monotone. The sardonically comedic talent he displayed in his reading of \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" is totally lacking. I would recommend this audiobook only as a cure for insomnia.
B000060P79|1.0|Out of all the cr appy punk-pop bands that have come out since Green Day, Simple Plan have to be the worst of the entire bunch! The band basically invented the whole \\"let's write songs about our awful lives and call it emo\\". Another thing, can you really name any members of this band other than Pierre Bouvier? Don't worry, you don't need to. Nothing about this pile is good from the whiney lyrics to the lame guitar playing of Jeff Stinco(okay I can name one but that's it).<br /><br />A lot of people describe Simple Plan's lyrics as \\"poetic\\" and \\"emotional\\". Here's some lyric examples:<br /><br />\\"Yesterday was the worst day ever,<br /><br /> And tomorrow won't be better it's history repeating<br /><br /> On and on<br /><br /> Summer plans are gone forever<br /><br /> I traded them in for dishpan water<br /><br /> And everyday is never ending<br /><br /> I need to work I'm always spending\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare<br /><br /> I'm just a kid I know that it's not fair<br /><br /> Nobody cares cause I'm alone and the world is<br /><br /> Having more fun than me<br /><br /> (Tonight)\\"<br /><br />One of the worst parts as well is Pierre's horribly whiney voice. It sounds like this:<br /><br />\\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! MYYYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy LIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiifffffEEEEEE SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuccccccccccccKKKKKKKKKKKKKKSSSSSS!!!!!!\\" *ears start bleeding*<br /><br />So here we end yet another review of yet another very cr a p py album by a very cr a p py band. Thus say The Metal Master 92...
B000024D4R|5.0|Pink Floyd is an animal unto itself. Not easily categorized within rock, this band has broken all molds and with \\"Animals\\", has broken said mold into little bitty pieces. There is nobody out there that can come close to what they have produced with this album. <br /> <br />Is the album long? Not really. At about 42 minutes in length, it is shorter that many classical music pieces from centuries ago. Are the tracks themselves long? Yes, three are, but that is the magic of the music and it's length. <br /> <br />Pink Floyd gives you the meat and then gives you time to taste and digest that which you have eaten. Once swallowed, you have no choice but to reap the imagery which this nourishment provides to your mind. The shadows, lights; it is all placed into motion as you fill in the gaps between the lyrics while their music becomes the soundtrack of the movie in your mind. <br /> <br />To add further commentary about this album would be reduntant except to point out an item which seems to be slipping by many.  <br /> <br />The first song, \\"Pigs on the Wing\\" has Rogers Waters telling a loved one (possibly his wife)what would happen if they did not care about each other. <br /> <br />The last song, \\"Pigs on the Wing\\" Part 2 is the bookend where Roger Waters admits that he too is a Dog. However, as a dog, he does not fit into the category described in \\"Dogs\\".  <br /> <br />He is now telling the person he cares for that even though he is a dog (he is, of course in the music business), he, as all fools know that as long as he (genuinly) cares for someone, and that someone cares for him, that he will never be alone or get dragged down by the stone (guilt). <br /> <br />He then states that now that he has found a safe place to bury his bone, any fool knows a dog needs a home... <br /> <br />Imagine a stray dog living in the streets. They will do anything they can to survive. Yet, what does a stray dog trying to survive REALLY want? A home. A home where they can be safe, comforted and loved. And here is where Roger Waters admits to the world that he too was a dog trying to survive, but that he is now happy and without guilt because he has found a love, formed a home and now has a safe place to bury his bone. <br /> <br />Thus ends his 41 minute + musical saga with the message that he no longer has to feel the guilt of survival. <br /> <br />Has his head gotten swollen by his success where he can state that he no longer needs to worry about survival? That he no longer needs to worry about the pigs or the sheep turning on him? <br /> <br />The last song, short as it is, sums up the entire album and his life in one minute and twenty seven seconds. <br /> <br />This is a must have album  for any music collection. Not for the timid and only for those willing to risk their perspective on life. <br /> <br />-Koa Feliciano-
B000B63EZG|3.0|If you like metal legends like Iron Maiden's \\"polished\\" metal sound and riffs and/or anything about Atreyu, you'll feel right at home with this one. The Melodies are excelent and they play with a very tight sound, but the [...]sobb singing trend has to die soon or I'm going to kill myself.<br /><br />I got this CD for from a buy one get one half off Amazon.com deal, and it's not a horrible CD, but it has the same sound all these post \\"nu-metal\\" bands have.  Extremely cool riffs, lack of creative writting, growling one moment sining like a panzey the next gineric sound. Get over the fact your girlfriend doesn't love you anymore and move on with your music.
0385504209|2.0|I remember my creative writing professor saying that the Da Vinci Code wasn't all that good, and that Dan Brown didn't have the best writing style.  At the time I Just thought my professor was jealous because he is also a writer though not as well known.  Once I read The Da Vinci Code, I realized he was right.  Dan Brown has a very simplistic style of writing.  I did like the fact that he kept his chapters fairly short, but the way he goes back and forth between characters and point of view is tiresome after a while.  As for the plot, it started out alright, but towards the end it just got so predictable.  I knew exactly how Brown was going to end it and who play what role in the outcome.  It was an okay read but I don't think it lives up to the hype.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Everybody was hoping for it. In 1995, it finally happened!<br /><br />That year, director Michael Mann (Ali) convinced the two strongest actors of our time Oscar winners Robert Deniro (Raging Bull) and Al Pacino (Scent Of A Woman) to co-star in the intense action thriller Heat. Heat would become the stars' second shared credit in a movie together, the first being The Godfather Part 2, in which both actors did not appear together in any of the scenes, and Deniro won a supporting actor Oscar for.<br /><br />Pacino plays LAPD Lt. Vincent Hanna, while Deniro plays heist master Neil McCauley. Hanna is aching to bust McCauley in the act, and McCauley knows Hanna's every move. Two of them are the flipside of one another. Hanna's got family problems, McCauley's got a love interest who thinks he's a salesman. Hanna is great at his job in putting crooks away, McCauley is great at his 'job' in stealing millions of dollars and getting away with it.<br /><br />We sit, watch and anticipate the moment that these two powerful men meet. When they do, it's for a cup of coffee in a restaurant, where each rival sets the other one straight. Neither will hesitate in killing the other if they ever cross each other or come face to face while in the line of duty, even if it will risk uncovering McCauley's true identity and losing the woman he loves.<br /><br />Director Mann takes a back seat and lets his star-studded cast which includes Val Kilmer (The Doors), Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan), Jon Voight (Runaway Train), Mykelti Williamson (Forrest Gump), Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode 3: Return Of The Sith), and Ashley Judd (Kiss The Girls) lead us into one of the most memorable mindblowing movie experiences of the past 10 years! Deniro and Pacino each delivers an outstanding performance in a movie that perfectly teams them up.<br /><br />Bring on the Heat!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A+
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd's theatrical rock opera The Wall still sounds outstanding nearly 30 years after it was released.  <br /> <br />The album takes you into the mind of a rock star who loses every inch of whatever is left of his sanity, secludes himself from all the troubles of his own troubled little world, builds an imaginary wall in his mind made of all the people (his abusive schoolteachers, mother, and girlfriend) and events in his life (his dad dying in the war) that have seriously screwed him up, and dives head first into a dark world of TV, drugs, temptation, and utter craziness.   <br /> <br />The music on The Wall is brilliant. From the opening track In The Flesh? passing through the commerically successful Another Brick In The Wall, the silent primal screams of Mother and Goodbye Blue Sky, the elusive Nobody Home and Comfortably Numb, and the chaotic Run Like Hell all the way to the finale, the album sways and streaks to true rock perfection. <br /> <br />The supplementary movie version of the album, Pink Floyd's The Wall, is a must see to truly appreciate and understand the storyline of one of the most remarkable rock albums of recent history. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A+
B00005JKG9|5.0|Glengarry Glen Ross is a superb drama directed by James Foley (At Close Range), and starring a powerful all-male cast including Al Pacino (Heat), Jack Lemmon (Grumpy Old Men), Ed Harris (A Beautiful Mind), Alan Arkin (Edward Scissorhands), Kevin Spacey (American Beauty), Alec Baldwin (The Aviator), and Jonathon Pryce (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl).    The movie is an adaptation of the stage play written by David Mamet, who also helms the screenplay to the movie version. The thing that drew me most to Glengarry Glen Ross was the dialogue. And since I tried my hand at door-to-door sales, I felt very connected to the characters in the movie, especially Sheldon Levene, played remarkably by Lemmon. The presentation made by Alec Baldwin in the beginning of the film about what it takes to be a salesman hit me harder than an iron fist.    The movie is not just for salesmen (even though I find it mandatory for anybody who's considering a career in sales), but for everybody who appreciates real movies.    Recommended    A
0393317552|4.0|This is not a book without flaws, however they do not detract from the central arguement that geography played a central role in the determination of which societies rose to prominence. Unquestionably this is true, at least to some degree, but the author's position that this is the main and determinative factor certainly raises questions for which he provides no easy answer in the text. <br /> <br />He has done a great service in a number of areas by pointing out that: <br /> <br />Geography and available foods helps or hinders societal growth <br /> <br />Domestic animal potential markedly increases the odds of a civilation's rise to greater influence and power. <br /> <br />Latitudinal exchange of information, people and animals was far easier and more likely than any other direction. <br /> <br /> <br />The book seems to go out of its way in fact the author seems almost obsessed about his insistence that racial and cultural varriables did not have any influence.  This may be politically correct, but it left unanswered questions as to why similar societies with similar geography and animals failed to achieve the same results.  At some point, especially in similar situations human choices and actions must have had some influence however small, but the author never wants to grant this varriable any credit. <br /> <br />Many have accused him of bias, but he strikes me, not so much as bias, as someone totally committed to his conclusion - someone certain he is correct, which is always a danger for any scientist, for there is a tendancy in all of us to see what we expect to see. <br /> <br />Over all this book is well worth the read and stimulates thought and ideas even if we don't fully agree, and isn't that the primary purpose of any truly valuable expereince that we are stiulated to greater thought and broader understandings?   <br /> <br />It is ironic that the author should succeed in stimulating this exposure to considering new ideas in others, while seemingly immune to conflicting ideas himself. <br /> <br />
0060833459|5.0|\\"The Effective Executive\\" (1966) was the first book to define who an executive is and to explain the practices of effective executives. Today there are several in this genre. But this book was the first, as is the case with many of Drucker's masterpieces.  <br />Drucker starts the book by stating that this book is about managing oneself and that executives who do not manage themselves cannot possibly expect to manage other people. <br />Efficiency vs. Effectiveness: <br />\\"Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.\\"  <br />For manual work, efficiency was enough. In today world, the center of gravity has shifted from the manual worker to the \\"knowledge worker\\" (a term Drucker coined in the 60s). For knowledge work, effectiveness is more important than efficiency. <br />Who is an executive? <br />Executive = a knowledge worker who is ... responsible for contributions (decisions, actions) ...  that have significant impact on ... performance and results of the whole organization (derived from pages 5 through 9). <br />Effective executives: <br />1. Manage time <br />2. Focus on contributions and results <br />3. Build on strengths <br />4. Set the right priorities <br />5. Make effective decisions <br />1. Manage time: <br />\\"Time is the scarcest resource, and unless it is managed, nothing else can be managed\\" (page 51). <br />Chapter 2, Know Thy Time, starts with a three-step process - recording, managing and consolidating time. Drucker then states the factors that make time a unique resource - the supply of time is inelastic, time is perishable and cannot be stored, time is irreplaceable (i.e. has no substitute), all work takes place in and uses up time.  <br />Drucker then explains time-diagnosis with questions for the executive: <br />a. What would happen if this were not done at all? <br />b. Which activities could be done by somebody else just as well, if not better? <br />c. (ask others) What do I do that wastes your time without contributing to your effectiveness? <br />Drucker then explains the identification of time wasters caused by - lack of system, overstaffing, bad organization structure, malfunction in information. If you have spent time in meetings, you will surely be able to relate these concepts to your work. This chapter changed my perception of time as a resource.  <br />2. Focus on contributions and results: <br />In chapter 3, What Can I Contribute?, Drucker stresses the importance of focusing outward, on contributions and results; as opposed to downward, on efforts. He proceeds to discussing the four basic requirements of effective human relations: <br />a. Communication <br />b. Teamwork <br />c. Self-development <br />d. Development of others <br />3. Build on strengths: <br />\\"In every area of effectiveness within an organization, one feeds the opportunities and starves the problems\\" (page 98). <br />In chapter 4, Making Strengths Productive, Drucker explains that effective executives build on strengths and make weaknesses irrelevant. Decades after this book was written, researchers from Gallup arrived at the same result, published in the bestseller \\"First Break All the Rules\\"; confirming that Drucker was right all along. <br />Drucker proceeds to outline four rules for staffing from strength: <br />a. Make sure the job is well designed <br />b. Make the job challenging to bring out strengths <br />c. Have an appraisal policy to measure performance <br />d. Put up with weaknesses - the exception is a weakness in character and integrity, which causes disqualification. <br />4. Set the right priorities: <br />Chapter 4, First Things First, deals with concentration. Drucker explains that effective executives set the right priorities and stick to them. They concentrate on the areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results. They also set posteriorities - tasks not to tackle. In the section \\"sloughing off yesterday\\", Drucker states that effective executives ask\\"If we did not already do this, would we go into it now?\\" If the answer is no, the activity is dropped or curtailed. This concept is explained in more detail in Drucker's book titled \\"Managing For Results\\" (1964) as purposeful abandonment in chapter 9. America's best known CEO, GE's Jack Welsh, followed this practice when he got rid of GE businesses that could not be number one or two in their industries. <br />5. Make effective decisions: <br />\\"No decision has been made unless carrying it out in specific steps has become someone's work assignment and responsibility. Until then, there are only good intensions\\" (page 136). <br />In chapter 6, The Elements of Decision Making, Drucker explains his five step decision process: <br />a. Determine whether the problem is generic or unique <br />b. Specify the objectives of the decision and the conditions it needs to satisfy <br />c. Determine the right solution that will satisfy the specifications and conditions <br />d. Convert the decision into action <br />e. Build a feedback process to compare results with expectations <br />In chapter 7, Effective Decisions, Drucker states that a decision is a judgment, a choice between alternatives. He explains the importance of creating disagreement, rather than consensus. Drucker explains that disagreement provides alternatives and stimulates imagination.  <br />\\"The first rule in decision making is that one does not make a decision unless there is disagreement\\" (page 148). <br />In the conclusion, Drucker states that effectiveness can and must be learned and that executive effectiveness is the best hope to make modern society productive economically and viable socially. <br />If you are an executive, you must read this book.
0066620996|5.0|This is without a doubt the best business book I have read this year and I recommend it without reservation to any of you that have not read it.  I am buying a copy for everyone on my management team. <br /> <br />The biggest highs from the book for me: <br />- Based on copious research, it was a five year project with many researchers. <br />- They tried to let the data tell the story as opposed to proving a theory <br /> <br />The biggest takeaways from the book for me: <br />- Get the right people on the bus, get the wrong people off the bus, get the right people in the right seats. I think I have always known this, but now I see the importance of staffing with clarity. <br />- Leaders that do not spend every day making sure the organization will function smoothly should they die or leave should not be leaders <br />- If you cannot be the best in an area, don't be in that area <br />- The fly wheel, there is no decision to be great, no magic moment, it is the result of thousands of actions causing the fly wheel to spin faster and faster <br /> <br />The biggest low from the book: <br />I don't believe that the greatest CEOs (Level 5 leaders) all live in little ramshackle houses and drive beat up cars. People entrusted with X billion dollar corporations understand that money is simply a tool to accomplish goals. I do agree however, that the trappings of riches can be a distraction.
B007V4QKPC|3.0|Love Shakira, but this album isn't all that great.  Her English albums tend to have a pattern of being mediocre and all over the place.  They never seem to be as great as her Spanish albums, except for Laundry Service.  The vocal fluctuations are also all over the place on this and the music styles are confusing.  There doesn't seem to have a clear cut theme to it.  It seems more like she just said, &#34;I don't care what we do as long as I can sing in English.&#34;  Are we going for really bad 90's throwaway pop music or big band 30's.  The only good songs on this are the mega-hit &#34;Hips Don't Lie&#34;, plus &#34;Timor&#34;, &#34;Something&#34;, and &#34;Dreams for Plans&#34;.  Dreams for Plans isn't proper English by the way.  If you're new to Shakira then go for these albums instead, &#34;Fijacion Oral Vol. 1&#34;, &#34;Laundry Service&#34;, and &#34;Grandes Exitos&#34;.
1591841216|4.0|I was given this book as a gift from one of the Creative Directors at the agency I work at. The type is large, the appearance plain, the paragraphs short. It took me no longer than 25minutes to read the entire book, but the thinking Arden presents I continually go back to, to ponder.  <br /> <br />Some of them are so great, that you really have to stop your reading and think about what he Arden is trying to say. You'll find yourself analysing his short thoughts in the hope that they will guide you some day in your own thought processes. He comes across a little brash on occasions, and I didn't agree with all the points made in this book, but he hits the mark more times than not, ands when he does, it's a brilliant lesson for anyone wanting to, or currently is working in creative services. <br /> <br />The book is filled with simple and witty insights aimed at challenging the reader to get serious about tackling problems. Not just in business, but also in life. He highlites (with the aid of real life examples and quotes) the importance of risk, justifies the things that are right about the wrong decisions, image, and having confidence in taking chances. There's more, but it's basically summed up on the first page... \\"It's the wrong way to think, but the right way to win.\\"   <br /> <br />It's a quick read in a small neat package. Which works well as a handy little reference you can pick up for some pocket inspiration. Overall, a great tool for the mind.
B000E6ESL2|2.0|This movie started off on a slow but understandable pace, although the actors I considered wooden and uninteresting except maybe for the college student himself because you wanted to know what was going on with him. <br /> <br />Yet as this movie progresses instead of building up to some answers all you get left with are many more questions and thus stop enjoying the movie and just growing irratated with it. You have no idea what is really going on and in the end it is just one huge twist that will leave you bitter you even picked up this movie in the first place.  <br /> <br />So yes maybe I missed something- I must have since many of the reviews on this film are glowing. Yet I will not lie- I did not understand the film. Hardly did I ever and I don't plan on watching it again. I do not recommend this film.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|....again I'm taking off 1/2 star, this time for Track #13 (he ought to just write a check to Prince with the note \\"Dirty Mind Era\\".  I really love Van's first CD, and at first thought that this one was not up to its level, but the more I listen, the more it is a gem to me.  My favorite track is \\"If I Take You Home\\" right now, but I have a feeling that \\"Being A Girl\\" and \\"At the End of a Slow Dance\\" are going to overtake it.  This CD is definitely a slow burn - you really have to listen.  It's not your average disposable pop music that's instantly catchy but just as quickly gone from your mind.  Van Hunt's music lingers.  It's going to stay in my CD player for a long time.
B000FA57RQ|3.0|Like someone said, this would make a good DVD extra, but not a good feature film.  The concert footage is sorely lacking.  I was touched by the \\"Spirituatlity for Children\\" portion.  It was a nice insight into the tour and what it was like.  No where nearly as entertaining as Truth or Dare, but that was more like a reality tv show.  Drama sells.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about Madonna Tour DVDs is the editing.  There's a shot in the Girlie Show of her feet at one point when there is a huge production number going on.  I'm all for Madonna closeups, but often in her DVDs, you end up losing a lot of the show in favor of her close ups.  And anyone who's seen Madonna live knows that her shows are huge and you need to see it all.<br /><br />I have 24th row to the Confessions Tour and am right by the catwalk.  I hope its as \\"over the top\\" as they're predicting.<br /><br />I find it interesting that people often use this review section to rant about their dislike of the artist instead of reviewing the product.  Even funnier when you can tell they haven't actually seen the movie.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|The best album I've heard this year, and definately one of the best since 2000. Gilmour doesn't belong to Roger Waters, and Waters doesn't belong to Floyd. Being a Floyd/Gilmour fan, I was very happy to hear this was coming out- ha, seeing as About Face came out before I was born.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I was expecting a Johnny Cash biopic but it was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter who makes this movie shine. I've been spoiled by movies like \\"Ray\\" where the actor actually has you believing he is Ray Charles. In that respect this movie is a little disappointing - Joaquin Phoenix does not look like Johnny Cash and does not sing like Johnny Cash so it was hard to believe this was a Johnny Cash bio movie. Of course the movie is totally saved by the incredible acting of Reese Witherspoon making this a very enjoyable journey through the trials and tribulations of the life of Johnny Cash.  I liked this movie very much but couldn't help think what a terrible bore this thing would be if it were not for the contribution of Ms Witherspoon.
B000E6ESL2|3.0|This is a hard movie to review without spoilers...but I'll try.<br /><br />If you were not a fan of The Twilight Zone then you will likely not like this movie. If you were a fan of The Twilight Zone you still might not like this movie because the movie gets a 1 hour and 39 minute treatment when it should have been done as a 30 minute Twilight Zone. But alas...The Twilight Zone (I mean the old black and white versions with Rod Serling) is long gone.<br /><br />Basically it's the story of a patient that starts seeing a new doctor...or is it the story of a doctor that starts seeing a new patient???? Either way...the patient (Ryan Gosling) informs the doctor (Ewan McGregor) on Thursday that he will kill himself Saturday at Midnight. The patient disappears all the time and the doctor then goes on a nutty crusade to find and help the patient in a land where various people look the same; characters start showing up as different characters; the day's events seem to repeat; and everything is very dreamlike.<br /><br />Did I say \\"very\\" dreamlike?<br /><br />I was entertained. Ironically I rarely read reviews of a movie; I do indeed rely on the average rating. At the time of my rental of Stay it had about 4 stars on Amazon and 4 stars on Netflix...and that's pretty good.<br /><br />Well, I say Stay was very good (4 stars) for one of those movies that you just hate the way it ends, but I didn't like it (2 stars) because it was one of those moves where you just hate the way it ends. Hence: 3 stars.<br /><br />There. Did I spoil anything?
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brokeback Mountain has many different layers, reflecting the sadness and truth of love and sexuality in the past and present...Not much has changed in a society claiming moral values, family values...People are still murdered for being who and what they are. For those who dare to love ... <br />  This film is very painful to watch. It isn't pretty, glossed over fantasy from Hollywood. But a very stark portrayal of what happens when people are forced to conform to what is considered to be normal. <br />  The acting by all is top notch...true to life and worthy of oscar consideration...Heath Ledger's character will make you cry as he breaks down and shows the love he never was unable to express before.
B0002858YS|5.0|I saw these guys at coachella in 2004. They looked and sounded waaaaay different. They had baggy jeans on and they sounded like Ice Cube. The singer kept asking the crowd to show love for the west coast right before the band cruised right into their cover of the 2Pac classic \\"I'm Your Baby Daddy.\\" One time I went out to Red Lobster. This was way back in 05. My woman at the time just kept eating all the food so I was all like \\"Fool rise up out this table and cop your own lobster!\\" She just looked at me like I was French so I did the tablecloth thing where you pull the tablecloth off and leave all the stuff on the table. Just right then I heard a bad sound outside and remembered how incredible I was. So I raced out to the parking lot and ate a whole bunch of snack bread. Sometimes I like to have a little bit of cheese. Anyway, I was just drinking up the lemonade and soaking up some rays, and this kid next to me just starts RAPPING. So I was like \\"Where did you put my table cloth, Cheeto?\\" And he was like\\"budabudabudabudabudabudabudabudabdaudabudabudabu--CIRCLE.\\" <br />Which was like the fourth time that day I had heard that.
6305212112|5.0|This movie has everything! Love, hate, devotion, forgiveness, humor, loyalty and a parade of some of the finest actresses in the business. A friend loved the character 'Idgie' so much that her dog is named 'Idgie'. The characters do have a lot of impact, and the story is well planned out with the flashbacks. I wasn't lost one moment during the trips through memory lane. I was almost saddened to think that there wasn't a real 'whistle stop' that served fried green tomatoes near me...<br /><br />Chrissy K.

B000268QB2|2.0|I first heard these guys when I was in SF with my bad homies kicking it old skool and checking out the Messy Marv album. Anyway, I was reading \\"Murder Dog\\" and looking at my arms, which were pretty big, when I heard this cd blasting out of a radio that a midget was holding. I rolled up and was like \\"What up midge, cuz I'm just out for the cash.\\" The dude looked at me like I was from a movie so I was like \\"Wait for a sec, I'll be right back.\\" I returned and the midget ganked my Dog magazine and cut out. I was back with the bro's and then I ordered a piece of bread. Yeah, sometimes I like to have some cheese.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|Theory's newest album combines their great riffs, intelligent lyrics, and talented style and produces a great piece of work.  Nearly every song on the album stands by itself, and together they are a great body of work.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|I once found a batch of anti-Soviet/anti-Communist California heavy metal albums issued by an obscure California label during the Reagan administration, which were funded by the FBI or CIA. This film may be another such project. Brilliantly filmed considering its intentions, clever in its tribute and debunking of \\"Thunderbirds\\" and grotesquely viotriolic about liberal Hollywood actors by decapitating and eviscerating bloody puppets of actors whose actual names, faces and voices are employed, Parker and Stone get extremely ugly and vicious here. A lot of actors are pompous and insufficently informed, but several of the victims here are not - and it should be noted that conservative actors, one of whom actually became president to enact his limitations and another who headed an organization that probably turned the 2000 election (the NRA), are unscathed in this work. I believe Alec Baldwin's brother is making Christian slasher films now, for instance. Given a choice of uninformed windbags, I'd take the liberal actors over the governing officials presently holding power; at least they don't run for office for, as Martin Sheen just said, \\"I'm not qualified\\". \\"Team\\" is also rascist, homophobic, misogenist, gross and even putrid, with the occasional twitch of the pinkie towards irony - 'just kidding' as a lame excuse for the offenses. Of course, Parker and Stone spare themselves - their film takes an elephantine point of view on global matters that pompously ridicules most of that world; anyone who disagrees is just dumb or worse a bomb-vested terrorist, like the Michael Moore puppet here. It would be a better film and might have more impact if it wasn't a sledgehammer in a too-small ironic glove. Randy Newman's song \\"Political Science\\" managed to do it all right in three minutes. This film is yards and yards of overkill, from guys who could have done it much better if they had real balls instead of the junior high kind. Or, to use their own puberty-addled terminology [...]     They wanted to let me know how much they hate Hollywood actors; they just made me hate them.
0307276902|1.0|See the above title for a hilarious spoof of this previously peddled as fiction but failed to get published as such book.  <br />I seriously think the author should be forced to give all of his money to charity since what he has done constitutes fraud.  <br />Even his writing style is a rip off. See Hubert Selby's, \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" to see where he got his writing style. <br />His lies have been well documented elsewhere so there is no need to review them here. I began to get suspicious when he said that he had to have root canal work done without anesthesia. My sister was/is a junky and she has had extensive dental work done with loads of novocaine.  <br />The fallout of all of Mister Frey's lies has lead to no responsibility taking on his part. <br />As one reviewer wrote recently,\\"Lying has now become its own literary genre\\" <br />God bless our current administration.
B00005JKGK|5.0|The Joy Luck Club had stayed with me all these years even when I examine my own personal life in the current time. I had read the book when I was in the seventh grade and had a remarkable teacher. She was Mrs. Lattimer (and yes, she was white), a Harvard graduate teaching at an impoverished neighborhood from where I used to grow up. Sometimes, I wondered why she never taught at one of the more prestige middle schools even right now. Still, it was a book that we middle school students had to read and analyze. The class was actually an advance seminar class. Even to this day, I am surprised that we middle school students got a chance to watch a rated \\"R\\" movie. It was a \\"never\\" to watch a rated \\"R\\" movie. The only movies that I can remember watching that were rated \\"R\\" were movies in my former AP english literature class-Othello (which actually contained nudity). It's funny because from what I recall, I had couple of friends from the regular classes and they have never seen a rated \\"R\\" movie shown in an educational setting. Perhaps being in a gifted class really did come with all the special privileges(even though I was never identified as \\"gifted\\"; I was recommended). It just seemed that every book my classmates and I read in AP english could never resist incorporating some kind of sexual element. Indeed, the literary works were very great. And of course, sex is also shown in this movie.  <br /> <br />Besides the entertainment value of this movie as well as the complex relationships between the mothers and the daughters, it was certainly a movie about survival. Presently, as I sit in my comfortable room, I could only relate to the need to survive and live a fulfilling life, a life that is so wonderful and full of bliss. Life is about survival. The word \\"survival\\" will always vibrate and echoe inside my ears and in my mind. It is a word that summarizes the very essence of life. When you're child or an adolescent, it is about surviving through school. Once you graduatefrom high school, a new level of survival comes into play; and that is to make a living. Let's face it. Life really does center around making a living. We all need and want to live a life free from having to live a low standard of living like poverty and shortages of healthy food and crapy material possessions. Virtually everyone desires to have a career and be financially stable. In times where the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer, insecure feelings arise and stays in tact somewhere in our minds. The desire to be married to wonderful wife or husband, the desire to feel safe living in a dream home, the desire to not feel frieghtened when you are heavily sick, the desire to give your children and your grandchildren the best possible life, and the list can go on forever...-Indeed, let's face it, MONEY MAY NOT BE EVERYTHING, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE ALL STRIVE TO OBTAIN IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS. Money does have its value contrary to the popular belief that you hear about how money isn't everything or how money can't buy love. Like the feather of the swan-This feather may look like any other feather and seem worthless, but \\"it comes from a far away distance and contains all of my good intentions.\\"

B000EGCITG|5.0|This cd i'm not dead is a great cd. Why? In my opinion Pink gets her point out aabout stupid girls which happends to be my favorite song on her cd. Why not buy pink at least she is putting her point out and not talking about sex,money,etc. Let's be serious she's not the first to say what she feels. So buy the pink cd and listen to what she has to say.
B0000028UK|5.0|While not as good as Ten, it is still a great record and yiels many great songs. Of course, Ten is in a league of its own, so talking about Vs. in comparative to that is useless. Vs. does not have that arena-rock sound to it. The production isn't as grand as Ten. But Pearl Jam did not enjoy(to an extent) the media attention they were getting from that. The album actually surprised me. I bought Ten and this one both at the same time. I listened to Ten and quickly put in Vs. I was expecting much of the same thing having heard Daughter on the radio. But it sounds like an underdeveloped record. Not as much work was put into it. But that's what created this great sound. It starts off with Go, which is angrier than any PJ song so far. Then comes the also angry and funky Animal. After these songs, I realized this is in no way a replication of Ten. Then comes the classic Daughter. This is PJ's best acoustic song. It was a #1 hit and deservedly so. Glorified G is a great anti-gun song. I love the self-mocking lyrics. Dissident is another great song. This is my 2nd favorite song here, Daughter being the first. All these songs clocked in under 4 minutes, unlike Ten, where the songs went up into the 5-6 minute range. W.M.A. is longer than those songs, but not as good. I like the song, it just gets repititious. Blood is pretty good. It reminds me of a Soundgarden meets Chili Peppers song. Funky riff. Rearviewmirror is another great song. It's a pretty simple song until Vedder starts screaming at the top of his lungs, culminating into a great ending. Bugs is a very good filler song. It actually has a good guitar solo, and if more work went into it, who knows? Might've been a hit. Elderly Woman is such a short, beautiful song. Shows the many capabilities of PJ. Vedder sings his heart out. Leash is a straight-up grunge song. Might've been a hit if Vedder didn't scream the f-word so much! Indifference is a spooky closer. I love the mood it sets. All in all, a great album. Next comesVitalogy, which is even better(and wierder). <br />
0790729628|5.0|The director's cut is far, far better. Listening to Deckard's amazingly borish narration ruins the mystique entirely. The happy ending inserted in the original is typical of how hollywood butchers something perfectly grand because it doesn't wrap up everything in a tidy cliched package. One of the best features of the film is the startling ending.

1400062071|5.0|I really enjoyed Strout's earlier novel, AMY AND ISABELLE, so when this book came out (seven years later!), I was willing to give it a read, sight unseen.<br /><br />ABIDE WITH ME is a testament to Strout's skills. She manages to get an avowed secular humanist (me!) to dive deeply into this portrait of a Congregational minister and father who is in deep mourning for his wife. Feeling that his travails are minor compared to the losses that others throughout history have faced, he starts to lose faith in himself. Eventually, his daughters and congregation also begin to lose their faith in him as well.<br /><br />Although the book deals with inner turmoil, there is a lot of dryly spun New England humor in it as well, a leavening that makes for a very satisfying prose mixture. I just hope that I don't have to wait another seven years for Strout's next gem of a novel.
B000001OAA|5.0|While I was waiting in limbo between Debbie Harry's last solo album and Blondie's reunion album, into the void came a band that fit my need for great music perfectly.<br /><br />This eponimous debut from the alternative rock band, Garbage, is the first album in a wave of new generation female-led outfits that took Blondie's example of how to make music from the feminine viewpoint and catapulted it into the rock stratosphere. Shirley Manson's lyrics are pure \\"hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\\" delight. I don't know who hurt her, but I wouldn't want to be him!<br /><br />Ms. Manson doesn't shrivel up over her broken heart, but instead comes out spitting and clawing like a wild cat seeking revenge against her former captor. With songs like \\"Vow\\", \\"As Heaven Is Wide\\" and \\"Not My Idea\\", Garbage turn her anger into danceable alt. rock and give the listener the feeling that Shirley and company know how he or she feels. The hit single \\"Stupid Girl\\" (not the same as Pink's new tune) takes aim at a woman who uses her shallowness to attract men only to throw them away like old kleenex. It's \\"Rip Her To Shreds\\" for the nineties.<br /><br />All the way through, this album makes vengeance something to rock out to. If you've ever been through a break-up, you'll know just what these songs mean!
B00005JNQS|5.0|We bought this movie for my husband and I to watch and we loved it... funny and cute... but the person who loves it the most is our 18 month old daughter. She says \\"Bots\\" when she wants to see it (which is ALL the time). She loves this movie more that Barney or the Wiggles. If you have a little one you know what that means!  :o)  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Academy Award Winning director Peter Jackson (Best Director, 'The Return of the King') follows up his award winning Lord of the Rings series with the big budget remake of the 1930's classic \\"King Kong\\". Now, I'm a movie buff. I've seen thousands of movies, but have somehow managed to never see King Kong. So, seeing this movie was my first King Kong experience. <br />And frankly, although hobbit-heads will crucify me for saying so, this movie's better than Jackson's Lord of the Rings series. A lot better. <br />The movie's special effects and art direction are absolutely amazing, they're beautiful to look at and at times a bit creepy. The all-star cast is magnificent and then there's Kong, who's ten times better looking (as far effects go, I mean) than Gollum. Oscar nominee Naomi Watts (Best Actress, '21 Grams') <br />plays Ann Darrow, a struggling actress who's theatre has just closed down. <br />Jack Black plays Carl Denham, a movie producer who's film is about to be axed. Oscar winner Adrien Brody (Best Actor, 'The Pianist') plays Jack Driscoll, a playwright who's working on the final draft of the screenplay upon which Carl Denham's film will be based on. As Denham races to the boat he will be boarding to go to Singapore and shoot his film before the studio execs arrest him, he discovers his actress has dropped out of the role. <br />So, he desparately searches for a replacment and finds Ms. Darrow. Loading her onto the boat and creating enough diversions to keep Jack Driscoll stranded on the boat; they're off to Singapore...Sort of. Midway through the ride, Denham reveals that he's actually searching for an island that's not on any map and is thought to not even exist. Skull Island. Well, it does exist and  <br />Jack, Denham, and Ann; as well as the entire crew of the ship get temporarily stranded on the Island and Ann is kidnapped by the natives who offer her to the extremely large monkey that inhabits the Island. Jack and Denham go search for her, but while Jack actually wants to find her; Denham just wants to shoot his movie. Jack Black, is known for his comedic talent and while this is a \\"dramatic\\" film; Black is still not in the dramatic role. He plays Denham perfectly and can obviously do drama but still uses sarcasm and comedy for his dialouge. Adrien Brody is capable of being a good action hero and pulls off Jack Driscoll perfectly. And then there's Naomi Watts, <br />who's literally the perfect choice in the role as Ann Darrow, Kong's muse and object of affection. The reason Watts is so good is because she's capable of looking glamourous in 1930's New York and still look like that when she's covered and mud and being saved from a group of T-Rexes. Andy Serkis finds his way into the movie, both as the basis of Kongs facial expressions and as one of the ship's crew members. Anyway, this movie really is spectacular, no question. One of the most entertaining and flat out great looking films of 2005, and at 3 hours and 8 minutes; It better be. <br /> <br />GRADE: A <br />
B000002N9L|5.0|This is the first album Prince has ever done that has been this electric guitar heavy.  If you lean more towards the rock side of Prince, this is the album for you.  Ironically, this album was one of the albums put out under his symbol moniker to honour his unfair contract with Warner Bros.  Yet it is ever so profound as he talks about his contentions with the music business and its disservice to the artist as hinted in \\"Chaos and Disorder\\", \\"I Rock Therefore I Am\\" and \\"Dig U Better Dead\\". <br />Keep rockin.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Depeche Mode has been one of my favourite bands since the early 80's, and I have to stay that I'm amazed at how (unlike most 80s bands that are still around) they continue to put out great music.  I really like all of their albums, but I have to say, that this one is probably in the top 3 for me.  It is a bit darker, more edgy, and yet more dancy than their past few efforts.<br /><br />My favourite songs on the album are \\"Nothing's Impossible\\", \\"Precious\\", \\"Suffer Well\\", and \\"Macro\\", but there really aren't any bad songs on this album.  When listening to the lyrics on this album, you can really feel all the emotions in the songs, which I think is part of what makes it so great.  Maybe this is due to Dave's battle with drug use, and Martin's recent divorce?  Whatever the cause, the songs are both beautiful and thought provoking - there are emotions there that I think anyone can relate to.  Although most of the songs on the album are pretty depressing and dark, Depeche Mode should be pretty happy with the outcome of this CD!  This CD is a must-have for any Depeche Mode fan, or anyone that appreciates good dark electronic music that you can dance to.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|If you have a short attention span, little patience, or if  you're looking for a movie with in-yer-face profanity, skin or violence - basically, if you don't understand what 'subtlety' means, then you'll most likely agree with the people who gave this movie low marks.<br /><br />This is a movie of subtleties, folks. I watched it twice before I laughed at certain parts (usually those involving Uncle Rico, Deb or Kip, not Napoleon). In my opinion, it's not the laugh out loud type of film that some promote it to be. It's more of a human observation film.<br /><br />The casting was perfect. The acting was skillful, especially when you watch the physical ineptitude of Kip and Napoleon.<br /><br />I don't think we were supposed to love Napoleon's dismissive, damaged demeanor. Ultra shy Deb barely talks, and then talks with her mouth full. Uncle Rico is lost to a fading dream. Kip can be sadistic (review the 'time machine' sequence - he knew what was going to happen). These aren't cutesy characters you are going to warm to right away.<br /><br />But the go back and look at Napoleon when he gets stood up at the dance. There's no blatant show of disappointment, but you can tell the guy is hurt.<br /><br />Nobody tells Napoleon or Pedro that a skit is expected after Pedro's speech. Almost everyone wants Pedro to lose. Like a true friend, Napoleon steps in and helps Pedro out - he 'has his back'.<br /><br />When Napoleon watches Kip carrying Lafawnduh's luggage onto the bus, he even manages his only smile in the movie.<br /><br />They weren't using sledgehammers to get the point across.<br /><br />In the end, I think the point is that there is hope for everyone, even the hopeless.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This film is awful in every way. I was hoping it wouldn't be corny or cheesy, but it was so much worse. I'm sorry for anyone who has seen it.
B00003CXA6|4.0|I recommend this movie.  It deserves its four stars.    I was one of the thousands of reenactors who helped make the movie in 1992.  I'll give you a true story.  You'll see rows of cannons shooting.  That's real.  Did you know those cannons shot down the radio controlled helicopter that was used to carry camera equipment?  It was the third film take of the Confederate cannon barrage for Picket's charge.  The day was hot, long, and filming was not going well.  The helicopter flew down the line taking pictures of the cannons going off.  Instead of flying to the end of the cannons the controller put the helicopter right in front of the cannon muzzle as it went off.  The blast knocked the helicopter out of the sky.  So, in 1992 a Confederate cannon crew shot down a helicopter.    Facts, this movie is fairly accurate.  It's not perfect.  They could not show the fighting on Cememtary Hill nor the skirmishing on the forth day.  However, it's accurate and most of us extras spent nearly $1000 ('92 dollars) on getting the correct clothing and equipment.      The one fact that you'll like in this movie is it shows the desperate fighting on Little Round Top.  Yep, the only thing that saved this republic was a Union colonel who used to be a school teacher and his little regiment of Maine Infantry.  Did you know that the US Army considers this \\"small unit action\\" to be one of the defining moments in history?  I will not give away how it goes.  However, Jeff Daniels is in his prime and does a fantastic job of capturing the mood of the moment.      I did not like Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee.  That costs a star.      The rest of the movie is pretty good.  Now, this movie isn't as good as the movie that defined the type: Glory.  Glory is a rare five star movie and it will go down as a classic of the age.  However, this movie is far better than the prequel, \\"God's and Generals\\".  You can get this movie for $6 on discount and you'll watch it every once in a while.  I would use this movie for school instruction on Civil War history.  Historically it's fairly accurate.  It only has a PG-13 rating.  If you used \\"Glory\\" some people may get upset over the very strong words in that movie.      I got this movie on discount.  If you look for a flying fence post at Picket's charge you'll see me, a small \\"reb\\" who is sprinting by the fence.    Help me justify my past excesses to my wife.  Buy this DVD :)    I hope you enjoy this DVD.

B000EGCITG|5.0|Dear Mr President is the new song a lot of people have been looking for. Yeah, it's a verbal body slam, but it's the way a lot of us feel. We would just like the man in the White House to wake up someday and care about the people he represents. <br /> <br />A pRes who has taken as much vacation as this one has knows NOTHING about hard work. Pink and the Indigo Girls are speaking truth to power and she is putting herself down in the history books with musicians like Dylan and Springsteen who speak from the heart about their experience. <br /> <br />I haven't heard the whole album, but I'm going to buy it for just this song and from other reviews I've read I think I'll be happy with the rest. <br /> <br />
B00005JOE8|5.0|-- in two ways. It's a great adaptation of a comic, and an adaptation of a great comic. The two factors combine to create a movie with a much more \\"mainstream\\" look than any other comic adaptation I've seen and a much better dramatic flow.<br /><br />First, the story: It's set in the visible future, in an England under some Orwellian regime with a crypto-christian edge. Agents of the regime are above the law, but not above using their power to abuse the rest of the citizenry. Our hero, V, began his the story as a human test animal in some inhuman medical experiment, but came out of it alive - mostly. Now, he's here for revenge against the sadistic crew that ran the test facility, and against the totalitarian regime that supported it. It's hardly a spoiler to say that V gets his revenge.<br /><br />V's mask is about the only real comic-y image in the whole movie. That general sense of reality only strengthens the rest of the movie, including Natalie Portman's (Evie's) imprisonment and the final computer-generated fireworks. There are plenty of surreal elements, though. Except for V's mask and maybe Evie, almost all of the faces are disturbingly asymmetric, as if the twisted faces represented the twisted minds behind them.<br /><br />Maybe the real surprise, if you don't usually read comics, is that V comes from DC, the publisher that created Batman, Superman, and their immediate kin. DC has had the Vertigo line of comics for a long time, intended to hold on to readers who outgrew the super-hero-in-tights genre (that's S-H-I-... never mind). I've enjoyed the Vertigo line, but I admit I haven't read V yet. Based on what I saw in this movie, that's about to change.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have to say I'm a fan of Madonna through all her various incarnations. She was and continues to be the ultimate pop chameleon. Her latest incarnation is retro-disco pop goddess, and it happens to fit her like a glove. 'COnfessions' is very accessible, danceable pop music.Led off by the huge first single,\\"Hung Up\\", the album really never strays far from the dance floor. One can almost imagine a disco ball circling overhead while listening. Madonna never really has gotten real credit for her songwriting, which is a real shame. She can turn out fine lyrics in well-crafted songs, but most people catch only the beat to go with. This album has a real dance-club feel, like it was made to be played in clubs. I feel this a really strong album for her, and it shows her in strong form vocally. Slip this disc in your CD player, switch on the strobe lights, lower the disco ball and enjoy!
B00006AW2J|5.0|The cover art speaks volumes. The tense, suffocating threat of violence in every corner of the world, the political climate in Britain and America, the gradual implosion of important bands of the day (The Beatles & Cream among others) and the slow, sad decline of the Stones' resident genius Brian Jones all inform the dense, weary and uneasy atmosphere of these 10 terrific tracks. Ardent lovers of this band have long debated which of the Stones late 60's LP's is the best, well this would be my pick (\\"Let It Bleed\\" is brilliant but song for song \\"...Banquet\\" is a stronger collection) and the main reason is the sound and performances. While \\"...Bleed\\" has an almost tossed off, jam session feel, this LP features tighter song structures and better band interplay and the overt blues influence doesn't sound as forced. \\"Parachute Woman\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man\\" are two of Mick Jaggers best vocals and Jones' gorgeous slide guitar on \\"No Expectations\\" is pure bliss. \\"Beggars Banquet\\" sounds as urgent today as it did in '68. Timeless.
B000002IQ9|5.0|I am not a big fan of live albums. Not sure why but I found this copy at a yard sale and I love listening to it. The best songs are: feel it in the air tonight, You can't hurry love, Two hearts ( a song that brings me fond memories of roadtripping down to Chicago) and Sussiudo. If you like Phil Collins, you must get this one.
006092988X|5.0|Frankly I prefer story driven books over character driven books.  But not in this case.  I feel like I know these people - that I could hear Johnny singing just around the corner on his way home from work.  This is an honest and insightful story and I hope it doesn't get overlooked in American Lit classes.  There are lines and images that have stayed with me for over 40 years and it just doesn't get better than that.
B0006GVJEE|4.0|This terrific cinematic triumph directed by Luc Besson (\\"The Fifth Element\\") is an action-packed emotional thrill ride that is very similar to the recent film \\"Man on Fire\\" directed by Tony Scott (\\"True Romance\\"). With the amazing work of the phenomenal British actor Gary Oldman (\\"Batman Begins\\"), the young cute actress Natalie Portman (\\"Star Wars Episode I-III\\") and the French actor Jean Reno (\\"Mission Impossible\\").<br /><br /> The film is about the rouge assassin Leon (Reno) and his relationship with a little girl named Mathilda (Portman) who recently lost her family to a drug hit by a dirty DEA officer; Norman Stansfield. Mathilda determined to revenge the death of her little brother begs Leon to teach her the art of \\"cleaning\\" (or in other words, how to become the perfect assassin) Reluctant at first, Leon decides to take her underneath his wing and teach her everything he knows. Their touching relationship shines and is heartwarming to parents and children (not actual children, this film is not suitable for any child. But from the perspective of someone who is the child in a parent-child relationship.<br /><br /> It is also very interesting to see the perspectives of Leon and Mathilda, and their feelings towards each other. While Leon looks at Mathilda as a daughter and sees their relationship as a nature-nurturer friendship, Mathilda falls in love with Leon. The awkwardness this creates is extraordinary and frowned down upon by the film rating system of America. The only version that you get to see Mathilda and Leon's relationship unfold is in the uncut international version that is named \\"Leon\\". \\"The Professional\\" is the cut `R' rated version. This film is highly recommended but not for the lighthearted, the film is extremely violent during parts. But the violence is worth seeing the heart-melting character development scenes. A must-see!
B000E97HIA|1.0|Twenty years on from 1984, the film Prurple Rain film speaks loads about Prince's future in the music industry. <br /> <br />There is a scene that sums up Prince's musical output of the last 10 years perfectly, which is if you took the best two songs off his last 10 albums you would have one fantastic album! <br /> <br />The scene plays like this. Prince runs off to his dressing room after playing one song and the owner of the club enters the dressing room to give Prince an earful about his fall from grace during the 90's and putting out albums that only the most hardcore fans would be able to tolerate and support his artistry. <br /> <br />Club owner- \\"You're not packing them like you used to. The only person that digs your music is yourself!\\" <br /> <br />Spooky huh!  <br />But then again the film gives us another theory on Prince and his music, as the film tells us that Prince's biggest song of the film is written by Wendy, lisa and Princes wife beating musical father! <br /> <br />Are Prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his fathers music sheets of written songs? Maybe that is why Prince started to run out of steam during the 90's because he ran out of his fathers ideas???...........Hmmmm.....
B00005JOFQ|5.0|A stunning, heartbreaking achievement. Glorious cinematography, exceptional score plus spare, first rate screenplay add up to a remarkable film. Perfectly cast. A milestone film that packs a wallop.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Bar none this is the best film of 2005.  Epic and majestic in grandeur in performances and production values, this is a film which will remain with you long after the credits are done rolling.  Anyone who is dealing with unrequited love or a love that they can't have for whatever reason will gain a new perspective of the emotion after watching this film.  Its not a simple matter of lust, co-dependency, infatuation or all the cliche ridden adjectives that describe love.  Love is an emotional bonding and connection between two people ...it is unconditional....looking beyond the faults and seeing only the good.  This film establishes that fact and what is heartbreaking is that many people will see this and condemn it for being a love story between two men.  This film should have won the Oscar....it is so meaningful in so many ways.  Yet, I knew that homophobic hollywood would never bestow its highest honor on this film because of the \\"gay theme\\".  Instead, they bestowed it on a worthless picture \\"Crash\\" which in no way can ever compare to the beauty in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\".  The performances are unforgettable...although you may want to put the subtitles on because Heath Ledger's dialogue is hard to understand....he mumbles so much.  Much better is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack Twist who is magnificent.  He tears the heart right out of you....especially during the last confrontation scene with Ledger.  One feels his pain.  This is not to say that Ledger isn't good, he certainly is...he is excellent.  They both play off each other beautifully.  No less magnificent is Michelle Williams as Alma, Ledger's wife.  A sad pathos is manifested in her performance and she should have received an Oscar for her performance.  Everything about this film is top notch and if you are a romantic, then it will leave you breathless at the end.
B000002UAU|5.0|SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND is universally listed in the Number One spot on every \\"Must Have\\" rock album list ever written. There's a very good reason for this: The album is brilliant.<br /><br />Although John Lennon always denied any intention to create the world's first \\"concept\\" album, SGT. PEPPER'S is in fact that, intentionally or not. From it's psychedically-themed jacket to the band's costumes, to the cardboard moustache-and-monocle insert in the original LP, SGT. PEPPER presents us with a complete package. But even more, the music, rather than being the traditional collection of singles, is linked, not so much in lyric and style as in overall theme and substance.<br /><br />Lush arrangements complement some deceptively simple lyrics to achieve a surprising musical profundity which elevates this rock 'n' roll recording into fine art.<br /><br />The Beatles here are musical explorers, entering into an undiscovered country of color, movement, darkness, light, laughter and tears.

B000E33VWW|3.0|Given that \\"Capote\\" sets out to attack its subject for an act of creative betrayal, it's something of a problem that the film itself so blatantly plays with the truth.  As William Shawn's sons have protested, the film's depiction of their father is completely imaginary (he didn't provide photographers, didn't arrange the reading, felt squeamish about the book); more important than that, Capote did not hire lawyers for Perry and Smith.  I don't know much about Harper Lee, but I find it hard to believe that she was as entirely angelic as this film requires her to be - requires, in order to recast a passage of history into a morality tale.  It's fair enough to do this, in general: any creation imposes a frame on its subject, and framing history will direct the way it is viewed; but I was uncomfortable with the mixture here of distortion and moralization.  The film-makers choose to show us nothing of the slaughtered family: that's a big point for Perry, who is left as the story's chief victim, and thus a point against Capote.  But the killers performed a truly disgusting, diabolical act (I think it is necessary to make this obvious point), and the idea that Capote should somehow have tried to save them is one that the film needs quite a lot of creative betrayal to push through.
0786886811|4.0|Ok.  After reading the other reviews about recipe discrepencies that occured in the uk/us conversions, I now understand why I've had mixed results from this cookbook. That said, this is my favorite cookbook to read.  She is chatty and fun in her descriptions of the food and times she's used them and there is great pictures in the book that really make you want to start baking.  I have also found some recipes that I love out of there (even with the recipe issues)- and i will now be checking my recipes against the website like that other reader so hopefully I'll have more even results.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Happily married and heterosexual, I was reluctant to see BBM, thinking it would be uncomfortable to watch a love affair between two men. On the contrary, I was completely absorbed  and deeply affected by this beautiful, passionate, and heartbreaking movie. After seeing it in the theater three times, I still couldn't wait until the DVD came out. There are many scenes I watch over and over, marvelling at the superb acting, the intricately woven score, and breathtaking scenery.  While waiting for the DVD, I read Annie Proulx's amazing short story.  This brought extra depth to the characters and helped me appreciate the movie even more. It is great to read all of the expertly written, positive reviews on this site and know  many others have taken this movie to heart.   <br />I was very disappointed Crash won best picture over BBM. When Jack Nicholson made the announcement, I turned off the TV immediately and didn't watch a single post-Oscar show the rest of the week. The whole process of choosing winners seems completely political to me. As excellent and thought-provoking as Crash was, seeing it once was enough. I felt BBM was a better movie overall and will certainly be remembered long after Crash.  Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Michelle Williams would have been my choices to win in their categories. Jake's portrayal of Jack was simply mesmerizing.  He was also wonderful in Lovely and Amazing, The Good Girl, Proof and Jarhead.  At least Ang Lee won his much deserved Oscar. I hope he continues to push the envelope and make movies which stir the soul as BBM did mine.        <br />
6305609705|5.0|War is a kind of madness.  It has its own logic.  Kill or be killed.  Follow orders, follow the leader.  Go crazy.  Do horrific things.  Become a beast.  Do all of this in a steamy jungle amid a alien culture for an unclear purpose in an ineffective way and you've got some idea of what Vietnam was like.  Coppola's Vietnam is the Vietnam of a soldier's Thai stick/acid trip.  The filming actually took place in the Phillippines, but no matter: that's better than Kubrick's excellent Full Metal Jacket which was partially filmed on constructed sets in England of all places.<br /><br />The jungle is dark and green and deep and unbelievable lush, filled with snakes and tigers, insects that bite and swarm, bats and spiders and little tan men who dig tunnels and can't be seen.  You shoot at the jungle, and you shoot and shoot and shoot.  And you can imagine the effect it has.  Like trying to kill flies with a .357 Magnum.  Which is what we tried to do in Vietnam.<br /><br />Army Capt Ben Willard (Martin Sheen) on R and R in a Saigon hotel, going stir crazy, drinking Martell Cordon Bleu and passing out, gets a knock on the door.  He has orders: go up river into Cambodia and terminate an army colonel (Marlon Brando) who has gone AWOL.  Oh, and by the way, Colonel Kurtz in his charismatic madness has built his own little unauthorized empire in the jungle, fortified with crazed admirers.  You might want to approach with caution.<br /><br />So this is the plot: a quest to a forbidden land with fantastic adventures along the way providing us with a view of the war from a gunboat.  The flares at night, the \\"purple haze,\\" the tracers flying at the boat, the fog, the black nights, the little things the men do to retain some semblance of sanity, smoke a jay, polish your boots, reread a letter from home.<br /><br />And then there is the ordinary madness of the war lover personified in Robert Duvall's swashbuckling army colonel who likes to take off his shirt and watch his men surf the waves as all about him bombs are bursting and bullets flying.  But he never flinches because to flinch would show weakness and possibly a lack of love for what one is doing.  In one of the most memorable lines in all of filmdom, Duvall declares, \\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  It smells like victory.\\"<br /><br />Well, there was no victory.  There was only the blood and the bombs, the jungle that could not be beaten back or Agent Orange'd enough, the mud and Charlie, always Charlie hidden somewhere, disguised or invisible and unkillable, like a hydra-headed monster, and dead bodies of your buddies on their way back to the land of the big PXs in body bags.  And yet there is always the mission, and so upstream Willard goes.  And the more he reads about Col Kurtz the more he admires the man.  And then when he gets there, the question arises, how can he penetrate the Colonel's jungle fortress?  He has been advised, belatedly, aboard the boat when it was too late to turn back and refuse the mission, that he had a predecessor, someone else sent to terminate Colonel Kurtz.  So Colonel Kurtz will know why you, Capt Willard, are coming to visit.<br /><br />He calls you a messenger boy.  You are put in a bamboo cage.  A photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) turned worshipful admirer of the Colonel gives you water, lights a cigarette and puts it in your mouth.  Delirious dreams and phantasmagoric nightmares, surreal imaginings and the haunting face of Kurtz and his poetry, quoting T.S. Eliot and Andrew Marvel, flood your mind.  You have called an air strike should you not return, and then--was it a dream or was it real?--the head of the soldier who would call the strike is delivered to you on a banana leaf--something like that happened or didn't and maybe you will soon be, or already are, as mad as the Colonel.<br /><br />Coppola and crew spent two years in the jungle filming this.  It is a great epic of mystery and beauty, a fantastic picture of the war, part brutal reality, part imagined enchantment with fascinating characters indelibly spun out by one of the greatest of all film makers.  By all means see this for Francis Ford Coppola, one of the few directors who could be considered a genius.rt brutal reality, part imagined enchantment with fascinating characters indelibly spun out by one of the greatest of all film makers.

6304806418|5.0|Worth noting that Evita is wall-to-wall music with virtually no spoken lines: not an opera so much as an extended music video, so the pop-music motifs need not be an anachronism.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Madonna, I find Andrew Lloyd Webber's music a bit obvious .. and yet -- and yet. Here everything seems to come together. It's a visually gorgeous film, the added songs (The Lady's Got Potential, You Must Love Me) are strong enhancements. The Che character's change from Che Guevara in the stage version to an Argentine Everyman here (desk clerk, bartender, cabinet minister, union activist) is an improvement over the stage musical and Antonio Banderas is a smoldering presence who carries the movie. Jimmy Nail is perfect as the oily tango singer; Jonathan Pryce capable in an equally slick role as the would-be, but hesitant, dictator. The montage songs are splendid, like Goodnight and Thank You, that bucket-brigade sequence of Eva's lovers that she uses (and the film uses) to get her from the street to the Casa Rosada, or like A New Argentina, in which Eva takes Juan from jail to the presidency. The faux-English country house lawn where Eva faces down upper-class disdain (Peron's Latest Flame, The Actress Hasn't Learned the Lines You Like to Hear) is another brilliant staging. It all rings true, visually.<br /><br />I've had others tell me the lyrics seemed shallow. \\"Don't cry for me, Argentina, and don't forget to get milk and bread at the store ... \\" Well, yes. That's the point. She didn't say much more than that. Banality often suffices in public life; politics are shtick in a media age; actors can leverage elections. The lady couldn't act but she could, as others have said, seduce a nation. She won't be the last actor to do so.<br /><br />Recommend owning the DVD for the cinematic values at the very least. It's a dark vision of public affairs but the times probably affirm it. And it was the best role of Eva's lifetime. And Madonna's.
0887307280|4.0|I recently re-read E-Myth and E-Myth revisited by Michael Gerber ([...] His thesis is to work on the business, not in the business. He is a big believer of systematizing and documenting processes. Dumbing things down so anyone can do them.<br /><br />Although the primary thrust of his books are targeted at small business (and since I started my business from 0, I am a bit of a small business person despite running the Billion dollar company), there are some gems for larger businesses as well.<br /><br />It speaks to scalability. Creating a system that can grow and does not require any specific person in order to do this. Then polishing the system at every opportunity to make it better.<br /><br />What I am finding in the current polishing is that the adaptability of the people is a key trait. People tend to be the barrier to new systems. The adaptable ones will thrive. Part of what I need to do is to also moderate some of the change in order not to break a good thing. Although we need to change - we also need stability. It is that balance that I seek.
B0000931QR|4.0|For many people, the singer's voice is too saccharine, the lyrics too sentimental, the sound too poppy to be considered rock. To which I say: true enough, but I rather like them for it! This album, a long-awaited third effort, would be flawless minus three or four songs that I found superfluous. But the rest ten or so songs make for great listening. Lyrically and sonorically, sentiments like melancholy, hope, and irony are evoked. Vocally and instrumentally, the melodies are damn catchy. The album is brilliantly mixed and has a slight '80s feel - which for me definitely works. (Their talented keyboardist deserves some props!) All in all, a worthy effort.
B000E8QVWY|2.0|My thoughts exactly. The pacing of movie was terribly slow. I was moved a single time during the movie: when John's father cruelly told him that it should have been him who died. The plot of the movie seemed stagnant as the majority of the movie consisted of John wanting June. In the end, I only felt empathy for Jack.
B000EMGJM2|5.0|I am a huge music lover and every once in a while I will just purchase a record on the whim.  I love R&B (old school & contemporary), Rock, Pop, funk, contemporary country, etc.....I didn't purchase this cd at first.  I first read some of the reviews on cdnow & made my decision to purchase it.  IT IS A CRIME THAT THIS GUY HAS NOT YET MADE THE BIG TIME.  This is one of the best cd's I have ever heard.  I am very in tuned to music & the latest in current/new upcoming artists, however I've never heard of this guy.  The name sounded a little familiar, maybe because of his producing.  THIS CD IS DEFINITELY GRAMMY MATERIAL.  IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A CD THAT IS A UNIQUE FUSION OF PRINCE, SMOKEY ROBINSON, LENNY KRAVITZ, JIMMY HENDRIX (w/out the heavy guitar).......GET THIS CD.  It's a smorgasbord of grooves that include old school R&B/Funk & rock with some jazz/blues & contemporary R&B additives.  I cannot express the magnitude of this musical masterpiece.  I am in complete awe.  This is a solid production of musical genius & if this talented artist fails to receive the recognition that he deserves, well then, I will lose all confidence in the music industry.  This is a work of art that all music lovers should have in their collection.  Complete and total ear candy.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I can still remember being 18 and watching the BBC mini-series for the first time. The chemistry between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth was breath-taking. Over the years I have worn out one VHS set, replaced it with the DVD set, and re-read the book so many times I had to replace it as well. I was excited when I heard that a new version was being made until I actually had the misfortune of watching the adaptation(and I use that term loosely). For anyone aquainted with the mini-series or the book, this version is little more than a sprint through the rich world that Jane Austin created and it does not remain faithful to much of anything. <br /> <br />In this world, any man besides a doctor would never enter the sickroom of a lady under anything but the most dire circumstances and that would usually result in an offer of marriage to save her reputation, but Mr. Bingly wanders in without even knocking. A gentleman would not consider venturing downstairs in his own home without a cravet and coat on and yet Mr. Darcy is shown wandering the countryside in little more than a shirt and pants. The language is too modern, Elizabeth is too childish and don't even get me started on the ridiculous scene in which Lady Catherine comes to personally pound on their door in the middle of the night. <br /> <br />If your looking for a true adaptation of this amazing classic novel, stick to the mini-series. This movie doesn't even come close.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink always manages to create an album that stands apart from her counterparts within the deteriorating pop music seen.  Within her musical niche, her sound is far much more authentic and real.  Pink has definitely set herself apart from the rest. Here, she validates herself in the category of female rock star, which is much more representative to the likings of Joan Jett & Pat Benetar rather than the guilty pleasure or cheese of Britney and Hilary D.  This is a great rock-n-roll album and her vocals are right on.  Another plus is that none of the songs sound the same, which can be hard to come by in today's contemporary rock music.  I'm still waiting to here a really good ballad from Pink, and unfortunately there are no ballads offered.  She has never released a ballad and it would be a good way for her to showcase another side of her musical personality.  The closest that came to it was \\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping (unreleased, & should have been released)\\" from Try This & \\"Family Portrait (released)\\" from Mizundastood.  She has such strong vocals and a true to the heart ballad would be a brilliant way for her to show her diversity and showcase her great voice.  I also cannot understand why her last album \\"Try This\\" flopped in comparison to the success of her previous two.  I thoroughly enjoy the album \\"Try This\\" & there are some great songs.  Unfortunately, the album wasn't marketed appropriately.  Anyway, as far as I'm Not.....this album is definitely worthy of awards for 2007.   I also love the hidden track \\"I Have Seen The Rain\\", which is a beautiful duet with her pops & a shout out to the \\"pains\\" of war.  It actually should not be a hidden track.  It's a great song and is touching that she shares this song with her father.  So far, I have not been disappointed with any of Pink's albums and I love all the tracks and all her cd's.  I do feel that her \\"making fun of Jessica Simpson\\" stunt in her Stupid Girls video is inappropriate (I'm also a fan of Jessica); however I have the ability to set that aside.  Pink is a funny chick though and certainly is not afraid to speak her mind & perhaps that's why she has become such a success.  She tells it like it is & after all you have to respect her for that.  This is a great CD, and I highly recommend it.  Every track is good and there are no skip throughs.  GO GET IT!!
B000EGCITG|3.0|I know there's many people out there that loathe Try This, but personally I think it's one of her best efforts, but not better than M!ssundaztood.  I'm Not Dead for me is behind them both.  The album has its stand-alone wowing tracks, but much of the album is filler.  For Stupid Girls, the album's first single, the novelty of the song has worn off and while the message is still there, it's not quite as \\"whoa\\" as it used to be.  My favorite songs on it are the ones you can actually hear her sing:  \\"Dear Mr. President,\\" \\"I'm Not Dead,\\" \\"U + Ur Hand,\\" and \\"Conversations...\\"   <br /> <br />The lyrical content of those songs is amazing and further proves P!nk as a singer/songwriter in her own league.  What this album is lacking versus M!ssundaztood is some good, fun up-tempo tracks that you can turn up and jam to.  I'm hoping that my opinion of this album will change over time like it did for Try This, but for right now, it's one that I'll burn my favorite tracks and leave the rest for later.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I only can join all previous comments and give this show the highest possible rate. <br />I totally agree with teevee enthousiast that it is so easy to identify with the characters and situations that also in my case, i had the tears coming up. <br /> <br />I was afraid to order the first season because it was not clear to me if it would be possible to play this DVD in our zone (Belgium). <br /> <br />Teevee enthousiast if possible please contact me about this on G_Spruyt@yahoo.com <br /> <br />Thanks <br /> <br />Another Everwood fan. <br />
B000EMGJM2|5.0|Alright, this guy should be given an award or something. The album is beautiful and transcends the R&B monotony with funk defying grooves and \\"where the groove will take you\\" feel. I heard him on a  <br />radio show and I thought it was a lost C Mayfield song. Album like this makes you want to go back to a time when that one album meant listening to it over and over til you had to save it for later. Enjoy.
0393317552|5.0|Diamond's main point is that geography, locally available plants and animals, and similar chance factors have played a central role in determining who dominates who in today's world.  I believe he is very convincing on this point, and for that reason I give the book five stars. I really enjoyed the chapters on the beginnings and spread of farming and animal domestication.<br /><br />One telling passage from the book:  \\". . . I do not assume that industrialized states are 'better' than hunter-gatherer tribes, or that the abandonment of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle for iron-based statehood represents 'progress,' or that it has led to an increase in human happiness.  My own impression, from having divided my life between United States cities and New Guinea villages, is that the so-called blessings of civilization are mixed.  For example, compared with hunter-gatherers, citizens of modern industrialized states enjoy better medical care, lower risk of death by homicide, and a longer life span, but receive much less social support from friendships and extended families.\\"<br /><br />This passage is emblematic of both the book's strengths and its weaknesses.  I tend to agree with Diamond that in the developed world we need to begin thinking carefully about why it is that all our advantages have not brought us a sustainable economy, personal contentedness, or happy family life, and what changes to our governments and other institutions would help change our direction. In my opinion, reform of the economics profession, and of economic statistics to better reflect quality of life, is central to this.  For more on this point, I would suggest Brian Czech's book \\"Shoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train\\"  or Herman Daly's \\"Beyond Growth.\\"<br /><br />The biggest weakness of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is Diamond's tendency to push his thesis beyond what the evidence will support.  Diamond sometimes seems to be arguing at cross-purposes.  In one place Diamond says a desert or a sea or a mountain range was a significant barrier keeping cultures isolated, in another place a seemingly similar natural barrier is easily crossed.  Local culture has more effect than Diamond seems to give it credit for.  Diamond sometimes seems so eager to be politically correct that he's leaning over backward to give excuses for maladaptive societies.ificant barrier keeping cultures isolated, in another place a seemingly similar natural barrier is easily crossed.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|2003's \\"Love Actually\\" told the story of nine different relationships in London.  Starting off five weeks before Christmas and slowly moving towards the holidays, will everyone find love during the festive season? <br /> <br />Yes, there are NINE different scenarios happening during the film.  The first is with England's new Prime Minister (Hugh Grant).  While trying to adjust to the ins and outs of things and a run in with the U.S. President (Billy Bob Thornton), he becomes intrigued with Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), who works in the office. <br /> <br />We're also introduced to Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) and his manager, Joe (Gregor Fisher).  Billy is an aging rock star who is looking for a comeback by remaking one of his songs into a holiday tune.  Much to the dismay of Joe, Billy decides to be brutally honest about everything when appearing on radio and TV shows while promoting the song. <br /> <br />Daniel (Liam Neeson) is in a different predicament.  Daniel's wife has just passed away leaving him alone with young son Sam (Thomas Sangster).  Although Daniel has a fascination with Claudia Schiffer, it's Sam who finds himself head over heels in love with a schoolmate.  With Daniel's help, Sam decides to win her over by impressing her. <br /> <br />Daniel's friend (and the Prime Minister's sister), Karen (Emma Thompson) also has difficulties.  Karen is trying to cope with the daily routines of family life where her days are filled with making costumes for her children's school recital while her husband, Harry (Alan Rickman), fights various temptations that face him at work. <br /> <br />Another scenario is the love triangle of Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Mark (Andrew Lincoln).  When Peter marries Juliet it's obvious that Mark has a certain dislike for her.  Or does he? <br /> <br />One of the people in attendance at the wedding of Peter and Juliet is Jamie (Colin Firth).  When he returns home he discovers the awful truth about his brotherand girlfriend.  He leaves and goes to a house in the country where he can work on his novel.  He soon strikes up a friendship with his Portuguese housekeeper, Aurelia (Lucia Moniz).  Unfortunately Aurelia and Jamie do not speak the other's language. <br /> <br />Sarah (Laura Linney) works in the same office as Harry and is secretly (but everyone knows about it) in love with her co-worker, Karl (Rodrigo Santoro).  Sarah has her hands full, however, with her brother who is in a nearby hospital and demands her constant attention.  Will Sarah and Karl be able to find love? <br /> <br />Colin (Kris Marshall), a server at Peter's and Juliet's wedding, has come up with the perfect plan to find women.  He's decided to travel to the United States (Wisconsin) where he's sure he will have no problem finding a female companion. <br /> <br />John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) meet while spending time on a film set together.  Their job?  Adult movie stand-ins.   <br /> <br />I had heard from people who had liked and disliked \\"Love Actually\\" before seeing the movie.  I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  It had elements of different movies (comedy, drama, romance and even a little music) all rolled into one.  There was also equal screen time to develop each story and to see it through to the finale. <br /> <br />The entire cast was excellent.  Laura Linney's performance was heart wrenching as you saw Sarah being pulled between what she thinks she needs to do (take care of her brother) and what her heart is telling her to do (pursue Karl).  Bill Nighy was also hilarious as the rock star that just doesn't care one way or another anymore. And for Hugh Grant fans, the dancing sequence in the Prime Minister's home is a must see. <br /> <br />It's easy to see where some moviegoers may dislike the nine different stories happening at once.  The first time you see this you may lose some of the details while jumping from story to story.  However, if you've seen this one once,give it another try.  It may take a couple of tries to see how the people in one story intertwine with the ones in other stories.  I know it did for me! <br /> <br />\\"Love Actually\\" has a little bit of everything.  This is definitely a good movie to kick off the holiday season with! <br /> <br />
B0001I55OC|2.0|I'm not one of those guys who demands that everything make sense in my sci-fi/action movies. A few plot holes don't bug me. <br /> <br />Timeline, on the other hand, seems to be one gigantic plot hole of a movie. It cannot be ignored. <br /> <br />Alright, so these corporate (and therefore evil) scientists manage to \\"accidentally stumble\\" on time travel when working on a matter teleporter (\\"kind of like a FAX\\") which somehow gets wired into a \\"wormhole.\\" Whatever. So they send people back in time to the fourteenth century for whatever reason, into the middle of a war, and are then surprised when things don't go smoothly. <br /> <br />Nothing in this film makes the slightest bit of sense. Not the bogus \\"wormhole\\" excuse for time travel (might as well have made it leprechauns), not the fact that the modern day English speakers can communicate flawlessly with the middle-English speakers, not the decision to fix the errors they made by sending a couple of people into the past by sending a whole untrained group there, not the romance that seems to blossom over like 30 minutes between a modern day Scottsman and the aristocratic French warrior-babe, nothing. <br /> <br />Most of these problems seem to be attributable to a questionable plot, but the screenwriters didn't help matters by creating a chaotic, breakneck speed script, laced with poor dialogue, that sacrificed clarity on the altar of having a few more minutes for battle sequences. The directing was shoddy, too and the casting decisions a little questionable at times (like the leading-man who seemed to be channeling Keanu with his surfer-dude delivery). <br /> <br />On the other hand, the battle scenes are decent, and if you're the kind of person who can turn his mind off for action flicks, this might not be so bad. It still won't be great, but maybe two-and-a-half stars. <br /> <br />Plot-holes aside, this movie's kind of a dud. One star because Amazon makes me, and one star for decent battle scenes.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Who's the real zombie in this 2004 flick?  \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" stars Simon Pegg as Shaun, a man with no real ambition who meanders through his daily routines.  He seems quite content with his job at an electronics store, going to the Winchester (the local pub), and hanging out with his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield) and his roommate Ed (Nick Frost).  But things take a drastic turn when Liz gives him an ultimatum. <br /> <br />After Liz breaks up with him, things for Shaun go from bad to worse.  Oblivious to the news reports of strange things happening in the vicinity, Shaun goes about his day until he and Ed notice a stranger in their backyard.  At first assuming that the lady is drunk, Shaun and Ed quickly realize the predicament they're in.  So what do they do?  They immediately run to the television to see the local news while they're having tea. <br /> <br />Soon, with cricket bat in tow, the pair devises a plan.  First, the two concoct several scenarios to save Shaun's mom, Barbara (Penelope Wilton) and stepfather, Philip (Bill Nighy), who has already been bitten by a zombie.  Although they differ, at first, on where they should end up, one thing is for sure, they're going to kill Philip.  The next part of the plan is to rescue Liz and her friends Diane (Lucy Davis) and David (Dylan Moran).  After that, they'll comfortably stay at the Winchester until all is well once again.  But with flesh eating zombies on the loose, will the group survive long enough to make it to the pub? <br /> <br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is one of those pleasantly surprising gems!  It also isn't your typical zombie movie.  The situation with the zombies seems almost secondary to the dilemmas facing the main cast.  The characters deliver great performances and good comedic timing.  (One of the funnier moments is when Diane is trying to teach the others how to act like zombies so they can blend in with them.) <br /> <br />Although the movie has more comedic moments than your typical horror movie, it's important to remember that the film may not be for everyone.  There are a few scenes that have plenty of gore. <br /> <br />But if you're looking for a movie that's a good mixture of \\"scary and funny\\", make sure you pick up \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".  You won't know whether to laugh or scream! <br /> <br />

006441034X|4.0|Before the film made by Miyazaki, (or by his student of some sort, whatever) I've never heard of this book, but since the film wasn't very understandable, I bought this book as a guide to the film. It turns out it's pretty different, a very different sort of fun. <br />In the fantasy land of Ingary, Sophie Hatter is born the eldest of three, which means there you are absolutely unlikely to end up with any sort of fortune. Sophie is then stuck in a hat shop the late Mr. Hatter opened. One day the notorious Witch of the Waste barges into the shop and Sophie, not recognizing this villain, lost her temper on the witch, and got turned into an old woman! She cannot stay, thus begins her weird beyond weird adventure. <br />She goes into Wizard Howl's Moving Castle. The owner of the frightful castle is known to eat up young girls' hearts or souls but Sophie is too tired to care. On the first day she made a deal with Howl's fire demon Calcifer who makes the castle move, for he is has a contract with Howl that will do neither of them any good, and if Sophie breaks the contract Calcifer will in return put an end to Sophie's curse. But since Calcifer can't tell Sophie what the contract is, Sophie has to stay inside the castle. <br />She meets Howl, Michael, and gradually as we read the book, the structure of the characters become obvious: Howl is the rebel-playboy (but isn't he supposed to be, like, the HERO?!), Michael is his nice apprentice, in love with Sophie's sister. Sophie has to cope with her inconvenience being an old woman, the danger outside that involves a likely war between the Witch of the Waste and the King, and the developement of her feelings for Howl. <br />This book is charming, it has wit, and it reminds you of plenty of things you might have encountered on you own before. It's a nice entertainment to pull you out of this world for a moment. Sometimes some things have nothing to do with the plot but are mentioned in good detail and that kind of annoys me, and sometimes the pase suddenly picks up too quickly for you to follow, but you've got to have this book! It's very outrageous, and unbelivable!!!
1400079179|5.0|Swords at Sunset and The Da Vinci Code are two very good books, non-fiction and fiction that should be read as a set for a meaningful appreciation of the Holy Grail story. I thoroughly enjoyed the fictional Da Vinci Code but was left needing more information on research into the Holy Grail. I filled that need by turning to something of a non-fiction companion book, Swords at Sunset by Michael Bradley, who also employs thorough research and archeological evidence to contend that the Knights Templar spirited descendents of Jesus to North America centuries ago. The Holy Grail became particularly established in what is today Ontario and Quebec, Canada, and Vermont and New York State. Bradley also draws on The Book of Mormon to piece together an absolutely enthralling and \\"true\\" story of Grail knights at conflict with Indian tribes. It may seem too fantastic to be taken seriously, but the book is rich with supportive evidence, including photos of ancient European weaponry found at Niagara and remnants of centuries-old millworks in eastern Canada, plus evidence of \\"white\\" people on the Atlantic coast of both countries - centuries before Columbus. I highly recommend both of these well written and engaging books. Well done Dan Brown and Michael Bradley!

B000F4PD7G|5.0|This film was shown three times at the Sarasota Film Festival although it was originally scheduled twice. It sold out so fast a special third screening was added due to popular demand. On Sunday April 9, 2006 I was fortunate enough to attend. Prior to the show, the Producer and Director were introduced who answered questions after the film. The most interesting questions and answers related to how the ideas and vision of this epic story were creatively conceived and made into reality within the setting of Iceland. It was a six year project from idea to finished product ... It was a huge hit at the Toronto Film Festival and was an equal smash at the Sarasota Film Festival. This film deserves wider distribution at theaters throughout the USA and internationally. It has all the qualities of a multimillion dollar multiple-award Oscar-winning film.<br /><br />Gerard Butler is superbly cast as Beowulf, a hero and fighter from Greatland who comes to help the Danes fight a troll who has been wreaking havoc among them ... The King of the Danes provides a background of the troll's murderous activity but fails to tell the whole truth to Beowulf and his mighty warriors. The scenery in Iceland is breath-takingly beautiful - views of stark rocky mountains, steep icey cliffs, green hillsides and crashing waves against the shoreline. Although, the Danes were fierce fighters a certain fear had taken hold - they no longer trusted their own gods to support and protect them. They were fighting a troll who managed to elude their  fiercest efforts ... The Danes succumbed to baptism and the beliefs of the after life as taught by wandering Christian monks. Amazingly, even the Danish King was baptized after falling deeply into depression and alcoholism while watching some of his best men die. Perhaps the soul of the King was tortured by some dark untold secret? Along with the obvious good versus evil aspects of the story, there are unexpected gems of hilarious moments with respect to the literary license used in the dialogue and deeper hidden meaning of the plot and story line.<br /><br />After Beowful met Selma the witch and had personally encountered the troll, he uncovered some bewildering aspects of the troll's character and behavior ... rather than seeing him as a wild animal, as described by the Danes, Beowulf noticed the troll carefully selected victims each of whom had harmed or threatened the troll. Beowulf and his warriors continue aiding the Danes but the battle lines are not drawn as straightly or clearly as before. The amazing curves and twists to the story line are very satisfying. The cinematography is outstanding. The battle and fight scenes are just as gruesome as required for the subject matter ... The most appealing aspect of this film is how the big bad monster is shown in a different light toward the end when the deeper hidden meaning of its behavior is better understood. While the film does deviate from the original adventurous epic poem, it has a universal appeal due to the engaging mannerisms of the characters and the gradual blossoming of the character of Grendel. The use of comedy helps balance the more gory gruesome scenes and their aftermath. Due to some adult content should not be viewed by anyone under age 18 without parental consent.

B000784WMW|4.0|Having the luxury of an almost six-hour running time, the 1983 BBC adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's JANE EYRE is notable for it's pairing of Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.  The generous length (11 half-hour installments) ensures that every incident and character from the Bronte novel is depicted, and the characters of Jane and Rochester (their evolvement and eventual romance) are charted subtly and believably.  The adaptation by Alexander Baron captures all the moods and colours from Bronte, with it's gothic horror and sweeping romance.<br /><br />Jane Eyre's rise, from unwelcome ward of the Reed family and pupil of the Lowood school, to naive young governess of Thornfield Hall, is beautifully portrayed by Zelah Clarke, probably the best actress to have played Bronte's difficult heroine.  Timothy Dalton's interpretation of the brooding and mysterious Rochester perfectly complements Clarke's Jane.<br /><br />The supporting cast is first-rate and includes Judy Cornwell (\\"Keeping Up Appearances\\") as Mrs Reed, Jean Harvey as Mrs Fairfax (she was Mrs Reed in the 1973 BBC series), Robert James as Brocklehurst, Blance Youinou as Adele, Sally Osborn as Miss Temple, and Sian Pattenden as the younger Jane.

B000E33VWW|2.0|I don't know why the filmakers of \\"Capote\\" had a bone to pick with Truman Capote as a person, but it certainly doesn't justify the 114 minutes of this excruciatingly dull and simplistic movie. The whole film is based on one idea: Truman Capote was a jerk. A flamboyant, self-concious egotist. That's it! Nothing more, nothing less. He used the murderers of the Kansas farmer family as the subjects of his \\"In Cold Blood\\" novel, manipulatively working out the trust between him and the perpetrators, paying the lawyer fees, etc. By the time killers had been expecting his friendship and financial support, he dumped them because \\"In Cold Blood\\" was finished .  <br />This film does a great disservice to the readers of Truman Capote - a fine writer, the author of such great American classics as \\"Breakfast of Tiffanys', \\"Other Voices, Other Rooms\\", \\"Grass Harp\\". Although Capote may have been quite an ugly person, it doesn't justify this one-sided portrayal. <br /> <br />On P.S. Hoffman as Capote. Truman Capote with his queeny mannerisms and lispy voice is an easy target for a character actor like Hoffman. So, what does he actually do with this material? He just replays his ostentatious gay character in \\"Flawless\\". Besides the lack of drag outfits, there's not much difference.  <br /> <br />Overall, I would expected much more subtlety and, dare I say,  \\"depth\\" in portrayal of such a complex individual as Truman Capote.

B00005JOFQ|3.0|Brokeback Mountain is a short story included in CLOSE RANGE: WYOMING STORIES by Annie Proulx. EVERY story in this collection is brilliant. The movie's only a faint echo of Proulx's wonderful observations and characterizations. Read the book, you'll see the movie is okay; but comparatively slow and flat. (ALL Proulx's work is great; no surprise she nabbed a Pulitzer, National Book Award. BBMT is only 30-pages long, dip in!)
B00000K413|5.0|This is creatively and musically the best album by TFF and may very well be one of the best ever albums.  It also is one of the best remastered cds that I've ever heard as the sound quality is simply brilliant!  Every track seems to have attained a new lease of life and sounds just as fresh as they did decades ago.  \\"The Hurting\\" ranks among my top 5 ever albums and trust me, I have heard many, many albums.<br /><br />I was very lucky to have spent my early teens growing up in the early to mid-80's when New Wave was in its pomp and when it seemed that virtually everything coming out of the UK from the Pop Music scene was original and different.  TFF competed for the airwaves and for my Walkman against U2, Adam and the Ants, the Human League, Soft Cell, the Eurythmics, Ultravox, Howard Jones, Nik Kershaw, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, the Thompson Twins etc and they all had their own unique sound but it was this album by TFF that really hit home for me.<br /><br />Having had a troubled childhood and upbringing, I felt that finally, someone understood the trauma and turmoil that I went through when I heard the lyrics to the tracks here.  Roland's singing was so heartfelt and seemed to be expressing the pain and hurt that I felt in my soul that I couldn't express.  Somehow, he was speaking to my soul, telling me it's okay, others have gone through your anguish.  I can tell you that singing along with the tracks on this album is a great stress reliever too.<br /><br />The lyrics to every track are so meaningful and the accompanying music is the perfect complement that helps the album achieve its goal of expressing the most tragic of suffering: the emotional and psychological suffering of children that is so often submerged and repressed by the sufferers who are not mature enough to understand or express them.  This is so eloquently expressed in \\"Suffer the Children\\" and in my favourite \\"Start of the Breakdown\\".  \\"Pale Shelter\\" is another great track describing how a child who needs love is given the equivalent of 'pale shelter' instead.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are also a plus as they include the hard to find \\"The Way You Are\\" single as well as extended versions of \\"Pale Shelter\\", \\"Mad World\\" and \\"Change\\".  Although not the most commercially successful of TFF's works, this is overall in terms of the songwriting as well as the cohesiveness and strength of the material is their best work by far.<br /><br />Very, very highly recommended.w a child who needs love is given the equivalent of 'pale shelter' instead.   <br /> <br />The bonus tracks are also a plus as they include the hard to find \\"The Way You Are\\" single as well as extended versions of \\"Pale Shelter\\", \\"Mad World\\" and \\"Change\\".

B000DWMN2S|4.0|Liev Schrieber (actor in \\"Manchurian Candidate (2004)\\" among many other roles) made his directorial debut with this film based on a book by Jonathan Safran Foer.  Schrieber also did the screenplay (adaptation) from novel to screen.  The film stars Elijah Wood and some other actors that no one really heard of.  It cost about seven million to make, but only brought in about 1.6 million.  I hope that DVD sales will bring that number up.  I never heard of it (the film), so I suppose it was limited released film-Which is too bad, because it would of been worth its price at the box office.  The movie is about a Jewish American who travels to the Ukraine to find some ancestral information, also he is a collector of ancestral objects ranging from false teeth to money to pictures, etc.  I don't know why the film cost seven million to make, I guess everyone wanted to get paid and it was filmed in the Ukraine-But it was an independent film that was glorious to watch.  Please excuse the comparison, but it was a light hearted \\"Schindlers List\\" or any other dramatic Holocaust film-If there can be.  People take things for granted, lose their ancestral history and this film portrayed not just Wood's ability find what he needed, but another to remember and accept what his past was.  The film again, is somewhat lighthearted, comical at times, but really, it isn't.  I believe it just seems that way because the Ukraine has just been adopting Western culture (good or bad, not the judge), and there were scenes in this adoption that was just funny, not because they meant it, but because that is how it is over there.  Schreiber did an excellent job in picking up this culture change as well as the emotional moments of the film, whether subliminal or in your face.  Wood, who I haven't really liked in anything lately did a great job in this film-He was perfect for this role.  The Ukrainians who participated in this film were very good as well, especially that of Eugene Hutz as Alex.  I don't know how these actors learn to direct, some are really good, some are awful, but Schrieber had an excellent eye for the big picture as well as small details-His ability to put this wonderful book (assuming, I will read it now) on film and tell the tale as he understood it was phenomenal.  I hope to see him direct more and actually get some respect for the films he directs if they turn out this good.know how these actors learn to direct, some are really good, some are awful, but Schrieber had an excellent eye for the big picture as well as small details-His ability to put this wonderful book (assuming, I will read it now) on film and tell the tale as he understood it was phenomenal.

B000003S16|4.0|Still a remarkable document of Fripp's voyage through the topsy-turvy musical landscape of the 70s. Sometimes raw and primeval, sometimes delicate and pensive, \\"Exposure\\" exposes every conceivable side of this complex man that you could ever want: apocalyptic ideologue, pedant, guitar wizard, narcissist, genious, and more. \\"Exposure\\" is a mass of musical contradictions and that's why it's one of the highlights of Fripp's career and probably his finest solo work to date.
0895260131|2.0|For Muhammad, religion was not a matter of personal conviction alone but a complete way of life, and Madinah flourished under his leadership. The Madinan model of government, based on justice, respect for human dignity and God-consciousness, became the template to which Muslims have looked for guidance and inspiration ever since. The Prophet drew up the world's first constitution in which the rights of religious minorities were protected, and entered into treaties and alliances with neighbouring tribes. He sent letters to the rulers of the Persians, Egyptians, Abyssinians and Byzantines, announcing his message of pure monotheism and inviting them to accept Islam. For the first time in history, women, children, orphans, foreigners and slaves were granted extensive rights and protection. Many of the Prophet's concerns seem surprisingly 'modern': he condemned racism and nationalism, saying 'there is no superiority of an Arab over a non-Arab, or a white man over a black man, except in righteousness.' He established laws protecting animals, trees and the environment. He encouraged free trade and ethical investments, but secured workers' rights and forbade usury. He worked for peace, but defined the parameters of the judicious use of force, when force was needed. He convinced people to give up alcohol, drugs, prostitution and crime, and promoted healthy living. He condemned domestic violence, encouraged his wives to speak their own mind, and granted Muslim women many rights not dreamed of in Europe until centuries later, including the right to own property, reject arranged marriages, and seek divorce because of incompatibility. And the Prophet encouraged his followers to seek beneficial knowledge wherever it could be found, with the result that Muslims never experienced a conflict between science and religion, and led the world in many fields of learning for centuries afterwards. Although his enduring legacy can be observed in everything from art to politics, Muhammad'sgreatest achievement by far was to re-establish pure monotheism. As simple and straightforward to understand as the nucleus at the centre of an atom, the concept of One God lies at the heart of Islamic culture. Muslims turn to their Creator for guidance, without the need for intermediaries, or the loss of dignity that idolatry and superstition bring. <br /> <br />The Prophet accomplished all this through the strength of his character and personal example; he inspired in his followers a love, devotion and sense of awe that was unparalleled. While other men would have been corrupted by the absolute power that he wielded in his later years, Muhammad remained humble, ever aware of the Source of his blessings. 'I am just God's servant,' he said, and 'I have only been sent as a teacher.' Although he spent his days in serving people and his nights in prayer, he preached religious moderation and balance; he forbade his followers to adopt a monastic lifestyle and preferred that they establish strong families and engage themselves in bettering the world around them, while remaining deeply conscious of God. <br /> <br />In the brief space of one generation and during his own lifetime, the Prophet Muhammad* successfully transformed the faith, mentality and culture of the people of Arabia; within 100 years his message had touched the hearts and lives of millions in Africa, Asia and parts of Europe. The Prophet foretold that each succeeding generation would be worse than the one before it, and true to his prediction, Muslims have not always understood or honoured his example. But Muhammad's teachings, speeches and customs were carefully noted down by his Companions, and compiled into books of authentic sayings which are available in translation. Along with the Qur'an, they form the holistic foundation of a satisfying way of life for practising Muslims, while for others, they provide a fascinating glimpse into the heart and mind of an exceptional man and role model from whom muchcan be learned.
0142001104|5.0|I read this book and liked it for a lot of the same reasons already shared by others here. So I'll limit this to correcting a comment by Pat of Westland MI. He states that some of the Zanders' work is informed by Landmark Education concepts, and that that influence is not acknowledged in The Art of Possibility. I don't know exactly what Landmark Education is, but I did see it acknowledged in their book---in, yes, the \\"Acknowledgements\\" pages at the end of the book!
B000E97Y6A|2.0|I'd looked forward to seeing the remake of this 1933 Classic Movie, but was SORELY DISAPPOINTED with when I watched it DVD yesterday. <br /> <br />King Kong was too slow in parts and the slow parts of this movie made it feel six hours long instead of 3 hours long! I think that the filmmakers could have shortened this movie by an hour and had a better film. <br /> <br />This movie was way too Hollywood and the overuse of predictable action sequences was very distracting to the movie. <br /> <br />The perks of this movie were the story/plot twists that were different from the 1933 King Kong Classic. The acting was great and I was amazed at how realistic the computer animation was in creating King Kong and other creatures on Skull Island. <br /> <br />However, I still find the the 1933 King Kong film version to be better than than this one!

0895260131|5.0|This is a gripping analysis of Islamic practices and policies - past, present and future.  It is also a frightening book and while not written in the least with Israel in mind, now reading it the day before Passover, reminded me of the terrible ocean of violence surrounding its people.  The author has done a thorough debunking of many treasured liberal myths about Islam - why is it that liberals rush to support ideologies that espouse the denial of liberalism, anyway that's a sidebar. The chapter on the treatment and confinement of women should be mandatory reading for all those feminists that queue up to lambast the intolerance of the West and bemoan its support for secular Israeli society.  Perhaps, the most worrying chapter is the last which draws together all the threads that point to the inevitable Islamicisation of Europe. This isn't a revelation to anyone travelling in Europe but having it neatly analysed alongside the appallingly supine appeasements of European governments made me shiver. For whatever reason, the birth rate in Europe (among the Judeo-Christian majority) is falling.  Obviously, if a Europe cannot replace its population, immigration will accelerate.  The challenge now, is whether something can be done to reverse the trend. And as Spencer points out this needs brave political leadership operating coherent policies. This is not an anti-Islamic text. I assme many secular muslims will welcome it. The same analysis could be written of Christianity pre-counter reformation. The terrible tragedy implied by the book, is that if the West continues to tarry with incoherent multiculturalism, as it has been for the past 35 years, then in less than 100 years the writing of such a book may be impossible. Sober thoughts.

B00003CWTI|5.0|I had to watch this movie 2 times in order to understand everything Magnolia throws at the viewer,  and I must say it was worth it despite the movie being 3 hours long. This drama is exactly the way  a great dramatic movie should be, which is best illustrated through the good acting and characters that play and fit the roles perfectly, and the mosaic style of the scenes is quite engrossing. <br />This movie allows a lot of time for character development, more particulary their individual flaws that seem to escalate throughout the movie but ultimately is what brings them together. <br />Magnolia is a rare breed that actually effects the viewers emotions and causes a person to think- the true definition of a drama- that I am positive you will enjoy.

B0009S3HI0|5.0|It seems sometimes that certain fans lose perspective of the true basis of music- to be taken on a journey, and, more importantly, to ALLOW oneself to travel with the ebb and flow, not fight it.   <br /> <br />It's not as if Chino came to your door, beat you across the head, and forced you to listen to the new stuff. He is human, as well as the other bandmates (who, by the way, recieve not enough attention). That said, they have every right to experiment with their music or not. What they put out is, indefinitely, a reflection of where they are at on their journey. Take it or leave it; I dare say most truly avid fans won't complain about where they're going.  <br /> <br />B-Sides and Rarities is, in this fan's opinion, beautiful. Simply  put. Some may complain about bearing witness to their softer side, or that certain songs didn't make the album, but i personally was floored at the strained-yet-erotic vocals Chino managed in their cover of the Cure's \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep.\\" Additionally, Abe's pseudo-tribal percussion was top-notch, blending in a sort of surreal cacophony with Stef's and Chi's dripping, heavy riffs, while in the background Frank Delgado spins what seems to be the original synth loop from Robert Smith's version of the song.    <br /> <br />Classic treats include acoustic versions of \\"Digital Bath\\", \\"Change (In the House of Flies)\\", and \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\", the latter laid over a dreamy trip-hop beat as Chino positively croons the normally rougher vocals.  <br /> <br />Covers remain a consistent motif on this album, opening on a rendition of Jawbox's \\"Savory\\". Next in line is a psyched out industrial-techno tinged cover of the Cocteau Twin's \\"Wax and Wane\\" (which, by the way, is pretty interesting once you get past the unfamiliarity). They attack Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Simple Man\\" very successfully indeed, Helmet's \\"Sinatra\\", and even hit on Sade with \\"No Ordinary Love\\", in which Chi performs exceptionally. Popular remains their creepish coverof Duran Duran's \\"Chauffeur\\", and last on the covers list is a sleepy version of The Smith's \\"Please Please Please Let me Get What I Want.\\" <br /> <br />The only true downfalls I say were contributed to the album were an aptly titled Idiot Version of \\"Teenager\\", in which they collaborate with some other band whose vocalist kills the song; and track titled \\"Black Moon\\" in which Cypress Hill's B-Real rapped with Chino to a backdrop of Delgado's beats. Then again, it did give the DJ a chance to showcase his skills, so who am i to judge?  <br /> <br />The last (though definitely not least) is \\"Crenshaw Punch/ I'll throw Rocks at You.\\" I like it for the pounding drums, thrashing, tense guitar and bass, and the signature vocals that seductively lull us into a trance and then whiplash into a throaty scream that sounds as if it's splitting Chino's lungs.  <br /> <br />So that's B-Sides. It may not be the thrashing punk-esque rock of Adrenaline or Around the Fur, but it certainly gives us a toned down, seemingly more mature and developed perspective of the Deftones and their music. Enjoy.
0679601686|5.0|I loved this book, everyone had kept telling me to read it and I kept putting it off, then I saw the film and I read the book and I loved it. The language was a bit difficult to begin with, but I soon got used to it and it was well worth the effort. The book's very funny and the story's excellent, all in all a must read.<br /><br />If you want more, there's a book out called Darcy's Diary by Amanda Grange  and it tells the story from Darcy's side, so you see the things you don't see in Pride and Prejudice, like Darcy going to London to track Wickham down, and it also goes on after the wedding, so all in all another good read. But make sure you read Pride and Prejudice whatever you do!
0316172324|4.0|I wasn't going to read BLINK at first.  While I highly enjoyed THE TIPPING POINT by Gladwell, the idea of an entire book on what boiled down to snap judgment simply did not appeal to me until someone who read it shared some insights.  I read it and I am glad I did.  It's another wonder-inviting investigation by Gladwell in his pitch-perfect voice.      Specifically, Gladwell is talking about the ability to process a reaction so fast, at a subliminal level, that one is already acting before actual thinking or articulation set in.  This works well for some and it works disastrously for others.  Much depends on how well the subconscious is informed and practiced.  Gladwell visits cutting-edge research on the subject and provides dramatic accounts of how snap judgments have played out.  The latter range from art expert Thomas Hoving instantly identifing a sculpture as a fake, when panels of professionals sweated it out through long examination and came up with the wrong answer, to the sad case of the African immigrant gunned down by police who thought he was a criminal they were chasing.  He visits an actors' improvisation group and studies how a few years ago the US military participated in a simulation that bears a resemblance to what the Middle East shortly after became and applying its traditional strategies was defeated by a group of improvisational thinkers.      I never realized there was as much to instant judgment as Gladwell kicks up.  He kind of peters out in the last chapter, but even that is interesting.  Will this book become viewed as an \\"answer\\" that will find put it at the center of workshops, think tanks and book groups like THE TIPPING POINT?  I doubt it, but it is still good information, thought-provoking and fun.

B000068FY0|3.0|I've recently \\"rediscovered\\" my love for Supertramp, and until now only had \\"Crime of the Century\\" on Vinyl.... its one of my long time reference recordings... a good pressing that sounds great.  I'm very VERY disappointed in the sound of this CD remaster.  Yes it's very clean, but all the life has been compressed (more like squashed) out of it.  Supertramp was all about drama and dynamics, and this CD has none of it.  The drums, the snare and toms, should pop like cannons on the final track, and this CD comes nowhere close to my 20 year old LP.  I'm going to track down the Mobile Fidelity version of this CD... it's got to be better than this.  Whoever mastered this should be tortured by having to listen to it.   <br /> <br />My old Supertramp CDs may sound a bit rough around the edges, but at least they had some punch and life to them.  My old \\"Brother where you Bound\\" is tremendously dynamic.... i'm very afraid to hear how the new remaster compares.  It's like one step forward, but 2 steps back in my opinion.  I'm very sad about the current trends in remastering.   <br /> <br />I give the music 5 stars, but the remaster only 2 stars.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|I've known these performances for years, some of them from the time of the original broadcasts in 1965, and the Impulse release presents them with the best sound so far. They come from the last months of John Coltrane's epochal quartet, and the music is taken as far as it can go within that format. The breaking point and the end of the quartet are only months away. For me, this version of \\"Song of Praise\\" was, from the first time I heard it, one of Coltrane's greatest recorded performances, stretching the form to its ultimate extensions without shattering the quartet's universe of discourse. Coltrane's first solo is so exhaustive in its explorations it's hard to believe it's only about five minutes long. McCoy Tyner seems to be left out there longer then he'd like--there's a chordal sequence about two-thirds of the way through that I read as Come back, John. When Trane does come back it is for a solo of terrific passion and density, with a soaring reprise of the melody, just before the actual restatement of the tune, to climax it thrillingly: a complete catharsis, and one of the greatest things Trane or anyone has ever recorded. That alone would be worth the price of admission.     \\"One Down, One Up\\" seems to have been canonized as the album's classic, but for me it's a long, dark search with intermittent discoveries made along the way, and with Elvin Jones trying several times to kick it up a notch--listen for his sudden increases of volume and intensity: sounds to me as if he sensed the thing was in a rut. There's another long performance, called \\"Creation\\" on a bootleg release on a Blue Parrot LP in the late seventies, even more difficult and dissonant than \\"One Down\\"--you could say both tunes are excavations of difficult depths and \\"Praise\\" is primarily about ascent--and there may be other performances still from these Alan Grant broadcasts. It's great to have the current sides officially, reliably available, with royalties paid to the family for a change, and Ikeep kicking myself for not having gone down to the Five Spot in those weeks. Oh well, I still have Birdland.
B000003TAL|5.0|Up to \\"Daydream Nation\\", Sonic Youth was a band that you either had to have a very open mind to their trademark wall of noise or develop a liking to their music, like acquiring a taste for wine when you first start drinking.<br /><br />  As they tasted some commercial success with the now classic \\"Goo\\", Sonic Youth ventured into more accessible territory on the double CD \\"Daydream Nation\\".  Of course, \\"accessible\\" when referring to Sonic Youth is a relative term.  The opening cut \\"Teenage Riot\\" is a misleading track, lulling us in a friendlier jam before \\"Silver Rocket\\" takes over to remind the listener which band they've got in the player.<br /><br />  As usual, Kim Gordon steams and screams her vocals and punishes her bass alongside Moore's and Renaldo's feedback soaked detuned guitars.  On \\"The Sprawl\\" the band positively cooks, \\"Eric's Trip\\" regales us with swirls and washes of white noise and \\"Total Trash\\" is feedback heaven.<br /><br />  The most surprising entry is perhaps \\"Candle\\", which, excepting the skronk guitar solo, is as catchy and pop as any alternative music ever was.  \\"Kissability\\" further shows that SY could play tunefully when they so desired, taking away any argument that the noise was a cover-up for lack of musicianship.<br /><br />  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  \\"Daydream Nation\\" is possibly the hardcore/alt rock classic album and a must have for any serious rock fan.
0399153322|2.0|Why is this so popular? The narrative is poor, the story is your usual run-of-the-mill predictable thriller and the characters are tiresome and grating. The only character you come remotley near to liking dies in the opening scene! Even if the stuff he yammers on about regarding the Holy Grail and the Last Supper is fairly interesting, but none of it is true! Everyone I know who's read it had believed every word in here! It's a work of FICTION!<br />I can recall few films that have been at least as good as the book they are based upon but I have no doubt the film will be better because the book is so uninspiring, hopefully some good acting may revive the flaccid characters.<br />Taking credit for other peoples work is one thing but taking credit for other people's crap is entirely another.<br />To give it some credit the way Dan Brown's become one of the world's biggest selling authors of all time on the back of a bad book is an outstanding effort!
B000C65Z1G|4.0|Another in a long line of dramas that were highly touted during Oscar season, The Constant Gardener chronicles Justin Quayles' (Ralph Fiennes) search for the truth behind the mysterious and sudden death of his wife, Tessa (Rachel Weisz). As the film proceeds through a series of flashbacks from Justin's memory, it seems that Tessa had been sneaking around with a large assortment of men behind Justin's back with Justin never mentioning it nor investigating the matter further. After her sudden death, he feels compelled to find out the truth behind what was going on as some of the pieces don't quite fit. Ralph Fiennes does a good job as a man possessed not by a lust for revenge but for a dire want to understand his wife and the secret life she was hiding from him. Towards the end of the movie, Justin's remorse for doubting his wife as he uncovers the truth provides a selfless motivation to keep him pulling at the thread of the forces behind his wife's death. While Rachel Weisz is charming and appropriately enigmatic as Tessa and Ralph Fiennes makes his character easy to sympathize with, the plot, when it is finally revealed, is typical and unimaginative when compared to the rest of the movie. Director Fernando Meirelles takes care to have the tension develop slowly but surely throughout the course of the film only to have it dissolve anti-climactically as Justin begins to submits to fate. While that may be fitting for the character as he isn't particularly driven by vengence, it doesn't work so well in a movie that's trying to come off as part thriller. The Constant Gardener can be more intelligent than the typical thriller and more interesting than the typical drama but the movie never gels together in a completely satisfactory way and as a result it flounders a bit from trying to do too much.
B000002BMD|1.0|Awful space rock. Chord progressions very tired and predictable. \\"A Design for Life\\" is the only song here I can tolerate.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Capote is the story of author Truman Capote (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and the events leading up to his publication of his best and last novel, \\"In Cold Blood.\\" While reading the newspaper, Truman stumbles upon an article of the senseless killing of a family in Kansas. Originally planning on writing an article for his magazine The New Yorker, Truman finds that there is much more to his story than he first imagined after talking to one of the killers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.). The further Capote goes to get the truth of that horrible night, the more he starts to lose it as he falls for Perry and becomes detached from everyone around him eventually making him a recluse and a total alcoholic. Hoffman gives the performance of his career portraying the eccentric and funny sounding Capote and Catherine Keener is excellent as Capote's best friend and fellow author Nelle Harper Lee, writer of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" While the performances are well done and convincing, the movie and the plot are never outstanding. The drama, the alcohol, the falling in love--they never seem any more interesting than typical Oscar-season fare. Capote doesn't ever come off as more than a good drama that is well acted by very capable actors and while that may not please people hearing nothing but rave reviews about how amazing the movie is, it's worth it to see the actors stretch out and give their thoroughly convincing performances.
B000001FDQ|5.0|I first learned of this album back in 1985 soon after it was released. Being 16 years old at that time and very impressionable of course and considering I had only been playing guitar for only around 1 year at that point, (I am now touring with pro level musicians, teach full time and clinic during season!)  <br />I was soon to realize that Yngwie would take over the guitar playing world for the next 10 years whilest everyone and their brother tried to mimck his increidble technique  for the instrument. <br /> <br /> MY best buddy at the time we used to call \\"Yng Jay\\" who was my best friend at the time and was my guitar buddy as well and whom I first started playing shred guitar with and had my first band with got me into this album \\"Rising Force\\". Hew showed me how to play what was called an \\"arpeggio\\" and how to play with technique and vibrato utilizing classical influence just like Yngwie Malmsteen did on this ground breaking album which was his first solo album. Before this album he actually was in an Los Ang. Cali. band named Steeler and did a Tour with Graham Bonnet and a band called Alcatrazz also showing off his polished NEO CLASSICAL riffage to the awe inspired crowd as their jaws dropped to the floor almost non understanding initially of what was actually happening here!! <br /> <br />After his third release, Trilogy things started to become a little stale for Yngwie and after about a decade in the spotlight as \\"ROCKS MOST BRILLIANT NEW GUITARIST\\" as he was called the man almost dissappeared into obscurity. In the past 5 years however and with the help of Steve Vai and Joe Satriani actually, Yngwie has made a come back of sorts! Even if Yngwie probably thought he never had left the building! <br /> <br /> This first album is his cleanest, most inspiring playing of any of the Malmsteen albums by far. The lead track on the album in my opinion which truly shines the most is \\"Black Star\\" this is incendiery guitar playing at its best. Showing Yngwies talents infull view. Not only was his vibrato wide, his use of classical violin like scales perfected and his arpeggiating or sweeping of the strings which is a technical term for when a guitar players rakes his pick across all the strings while formulating an outline of a scale??Hugh? Never mind :>).  <br /> <br />Point is if your a guitar nut as I am and you havent heard this album it is almost a crime and you should be imprisoned for not owning it!. Yngwie was NOT the first to take this type of neo classical approach to the guitar \\"Dont forget Randy Rhoads and of course Ritchie Blackmore for whom Yngwie admits an obvious influence, of Blackmore that is. Look how he still dresses even today in his shiny metal bracelets and ruffly shirts from the Viking era!Yngwies choice of weapons to blast the masses with are his mighty wall of Marshall amps and his vintage Fender Stratocaster guitars. Seemingly larger than life at one time, Yngwie still believes in himself which no matter how you personally feel about the guy you have to admire at some extent.  <br /> <br />You have to give kudos to the man and his chops! A funk meister HE IS NOT! Whether you think Yngwie is a genious or a \\"gnat note playing shredhead\\" you owe it to yourself to believe in Yngwie Malmsteens \\"Rising Force\\" album. It is and always will be a ONE OF A KIND ALBUM that even YNGWIE will never DUPLICATE again! NEver will their be such incredible TONE from his MARSHALL amps and that Fiery feel from his fingers playing every note like it was his last ever to be plaid! Back then you see, Yngwie Malmsteen was HUNGRY for it , Hungry to rule the guitar world, and for a time....he did just that! A MUST HAVE! 5 Stars!*****
B000267JQK|5.0|A great sound of metal and a great blend of rock adds to this perfect cd. songs such as Fine Again and Broken make this a cd full of heart ache, but songs such as Gasoline and Fxxx It make a cd full of hatred and anger.

B0000089A1|4.0|\\"Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround Part One\\" (gotta love that title), the Kinks' last release on Pye, doesn't quite reach the level of their best work but it's pretty great just the same. Stylistically, \\"Lola\\" goes in a harder-rocking direction than the preceding \\"Arthur\\" but also shows signs of the rootsy, country-influenced music the band would dive into completely on their next release \\"Muswell Hillbillies.\\" <br /> <br />The short opening medley \\"Intro/The Contenders\\" gets things off to a rocking start and forms a bookend with the concluding \\"Got to Be Free.\\" \\"Strangers\\" is one of Dave Davies' greatest achievements, a gorgeous ballad with strange, quasi-mystical lyrics that could only have come from his mind. \\"Get Back in the Line\\" and \\"A Long Way from Home\\" are great melancholy ballads from Ray's pen, while \\"Powerman\\" rocks out with a cool circular riff. The sarcastic, hilariously catchy \\"Apeman\\" is one of the band's all-time best singles. And of course there's the album's calling card, the wonderfully weird cross-dressing anthem \\"Lola,\\" which remains probably the band's second most well-known song after \\"You Really Got Me.\\" <br /> <br />The record's only real stumbles (\\"The Moneygoround,\\" \\"Top of the Pops,\\" and to some extent \\"Denmark Street\\") occur when Ray strays too far into the theatrical hamminess that would mar several of the Kinks' later records.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Many know that Square films did not do a very good job with The Spirits Within, and rumor had it that Square films would be shut down for good.  They briefly returned after doing a short film fo rthe Animatrix, but now they have a true masterpiece, Advent Children. <br /> <br />I bought this movie as a bootleg with english subtitles.  Despite the fact that I spent most of my time reading subtitles and also the fact that it was a hard time following the characters, I was fairly impressed with this movie. <br /> <br />To me the movie is basically about Cloud trying to forgive himself for the death of Aeries, whom Sepiroth(did I spell that right?) killed in Final Fantasy VII.  In the beginning of the film Cloud is hurt and empty, becuase the, er, cloud of Aeries' death hangs over him.  At the same time, a disease is attacking the citizens of the city, and later in the film it is discovered that Cloud has it also. <br /> <br />The leader of Shin-Ra is now in a wheel chair, and at the beginning of the film wishes to see CLoud because he wants Cloud's help in righting the wrongs of Shin-Ra.  He wants to do this by trying to cure the kids. Cloud declines his offer.  But eventually, he does help when some of the orphans are taken away from the house by the atagonist. <br /> <br />The movie has awesome cinematics, with swordfights that take place in mid-air, on motor cycles, and jumping from building to building.  I still thought that the plot was thin just as The Spirits Within, but Square was able to get away with it this time, becuase if you have a basic idea about the story of FFVII, you'll have no problem following the story of this film.  And of course, when it's officallu released, I can watch it in English.
0793518326|5.0|As a musician, I cannot praise this book enough. Unlike much smaller books, that have about 8 or 10 songs, and claim to be the complete scores, and aren't, this book is! <br />Some of those other books actually have songs in the wrong key. <br />They claim to be completely acurate, and cost top dollar. Many of you have probably seen them in catalogs. They have 8 or 10 songs each. They are known as \\"the red book\\", \\"the blue book\\" etc. <br />Another unforgivable error I came across just the other day was, the intro to Please, Please Me, was incorrect. Wrong strings, wrong notes. What nerve! This book, I call it The White Book, was right on as usual. It is of unbelieveable value to me. <br />It is also quite a \\"nice piece of bookage\\" as it were. Beautifully bound, quality paper. On, and on. <br />If there is one bad thing about the book, it is that the print is a bit small. It's hard for us 48 year olds to read without our glasses! However the book is over eleven hundred pages as is. The reason for the small print is obvious. If you are really serious about having all the correct notation played by          The Fab Four, along with notation for the other instruments on the recordings, then this is the book for you! No I don't own stock in the publishing company. I just would like other big fans to enjoy the book as much as I do. Have fun.       Remember, All you need is LOVE!!!
B000EMGJM2|4.0|Can't say anything bad about VH's second album. It hit the spot straight on. \\"At The End Of A Slow Dance\\" is my favorite - retro 80s  vibe. Lyrically interesting to say the least. His cover of \\"Mean Sleep\\" is hot - Love Nikka Costa. Overall I give the album a 4.5. Although \\"Ride, Ride, Ride\\" is very Lenny K. I didn't let it annoy me;it's easy to overlook. Can't wait to see him at the Canal Room!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I haven't watched Buffy or other Joss stuff. I don't like sci-fi as a general rule. I didn't remember \\"Firefly\\" from when it was actually on air, and I didn't see \\"Serenity\\" in theatres. Yet enough of my friends kept mentioning this series repeatedly. So I watched, and when I started watching, I fell in love with the characters and witty dialogue. I was surprised how many unaired episodes were included on the dvds, and that the pilot episode was not shown at the beginning of the on-air series because Fox didn't think it was action-packed enough. Perhaps the fate of this series would have been different if Fox has listened to the intent of the creators and given it a fair chance by showing all of the episodes. My favorite episodes: Shindig, Jaynestown, Out of Gas, Heart of Gold.
B00000272N|5.0|Well Well, what can I say?  This has to be the greatest Grunge CD to have ever been recorded.  Forget about Nirvana, this band will literally take your breath away.  Unlike nevermind, your copy of facelift won't spend its life sandwiched between a naked baby swimming through the sea and a bunch of overrated songs on the back cover because it will be glued to your CD player for the rest of its life.  <br /> <br />This album is perfect in every way from Jerry Cantrell's crunching guitar riffs that send shivers running down your spine To Layne Staley's bleak yet brilliant vocals.  Their debut starts with \\" we die young\\", a song with rough loud @ss vocals and lyrics complemented by one of Cantrell's unique dirty guitar riffs.  \\" Man in the box\\" is up second, which is commercially one of the bands most recognizable songs.  The simple yet effective lyrics are written in the perspective of an abandoned dog and its plea to be let free, the line \\" won't you come and save me\\" is aimed towards God and was a way of expressing Layne Staley (lead singer) opinions on how God isn't real as he has no physical appearance.  The song also features one of Cantrell's finest guitar solos and Layne's most powerful vocals (in particular where he goes from the calmly sang verses, straight in to the blinding chorus.   <br /> <br />Track 3 goes by the name of \\"sea of sorrow\\" (a personal favourite on this album).  There's just something about this song I really like, the songs structure is pretty much perfect.  It starts off with another brilliantly distorted guitar riff by Cantrell, which is then accompanied 10 seconds later with a great bass line by Mike Starr.  The riff and bass line continue for the 1st 21 seconds of the song, then Sean Kinney's drum beat is applied along with the first line of the song delivered by Layne Staley that change the mood of the song.  The things I particularly enjoy about this song is Sean Kinney's drumbeats that that a real boost of energy (particularly duringthe chorus), Cantrell's excellent guitar solo, the lyrics and general concept of the song that the instruments really bring some meaning too and of course Layne Staley's vocal work. <br /> <br />\\" It Aint like that\\" is the first song I ever heard by the band, and unlike most songs that normally take me a while to adjust to, I loved it from the first few seconds.  This song single handedly made me buy this album and their whole discography for that matter.  Some people find this song fairly boring claiming that its slow and uninteresting, but I love everything about it.  The distorted single chord riff that cralws along through the song, grimy lyrics and vocals, and another simple yet effective guitar solo by Cantrell.  The album finishes with \\" real thing\\".  A song based on cocaine and the long-term trouble it can cause.  This song is like a sample of the general concept of there following full-length studio album yet to come, which is riddled with lyrics about Staley's Heroin addiction that sadly marched him to his grave on the 5th April 2002 (R.I.P.).  Real thing boasts a great guitar riff, brilliant drumming from Sean Kinney accompanied with another dose of grit-paved vocals from Staley.  This song is a great way of rounding off the outstanding album and before you know it you'll be completely hooked to \\"Facelift\\". <br /> <br />DO NOT listen to anyone who dislikes this, as they are not true fans and don't understand the band.  10/10  5*. R.I.P. Layne xx  <br />
B000058THK|5.0|I don't think I've ever before experienced such frustration in trying to assess a product. Here a well-regarded and fairly well-known pianist sits down and records all (even that's up for grabs) the piano music of a pretty well-known and well-regarded composer and barely a peep out there in Internet land.<br /><br />What I did encounter after a lot of searching, and according to different reviewers who deigned to barely mention this bulky and hard-to-ignore boxed set, was this dopey basketful of professional opinions:<br /><br />1) The recording quality was poor according to one guy<br />2) The piano was out of tune according to some editor who happened to also be a piano tuner<br />3) The music was criminally recorded using a piano with beat hammers and strings<br />4) Demus may or may not have recorded the set with a period instrument that also may have had beat hammers and strings<br />5) Nobody should record Schumann on a period instrument according to another expert (without really letting us know if this was the case here)<br />6) The interpretations were wooden<br />7) The interpretations were fabulous despite the crappy sound and beat up old out-of-tune piano<br />8) Nobody was sure if this was his complete Schumann recorded in the 1970s and released on Musical Heritage or these were new DDD recordings as listed<br /><br />OK--as the notes with this set absolutely stink and no one out in Internet land seems to have any consistent and coherent thing to say about it, this then is my judgement, based on careful listening and a few intelligent guesses.<br /><br />1) The interpretations are great, wonderful, really enjoyable, idiomatic--some might consider them slightly wooden because there's next-to-no pedal which leads me to believe it is a period instrument he's recorded on. This isn't Argerich slamming away at these so don't expect that. Yamaha fans will be disappointed. Demus clearly knows his Schumann and plays crisply and accurately.<br />2) The sound quality, while hardly SACD, is just fine and, again if this is a period instrument and I sure tend to think so, what I'm hearing would be about right. I rather like the engineering as the result is intimate and warm<br />3) Honestly, did Demus record all these in the 1970s without them getting any attention and then do it all over again in the 1980s just to get ignored again? I hear distinct tape hiss if I listen closely, this doesn't sound like a 1989 DDD recording (which the box claims it to be) which is probably why the recording has some warmth and (audible tape hiss)<br />4) Who am I to argue with an editor/piano tuner but if this piano is out of tune I'm not noticing it one zot. Also, didn't they tune pianos a little differently way back in 1850 or so?<br /><br />SO--I'll guess this is the complete piano music of Robert Schumann (perhaps minus one small piece according to yet another miffed commentator, although he keeps talking about a 12 CD set and this has 13 discs!)recorded in the 1970s with Jorg Demus playing a piano built around 1850 or so with everything that implies. I'll also guess that a lot of reviewers out there, left to fend for themselves without some promotional sheet from the label, maybe without even free promo copies, were really reaching a bit. Even if I'm wrong I seem to be doing better than the second-guessing I found elsewhere and anyway the result is really enjoyable. I simply like this set a lot even if someday I may discover it is, in fact, Ernest Borgnine playing a badly tuned pool hall upright in 1953. Less than no stars to Nuovo Era for never seeming to get the presentation of this delightful set right--license it to Brilliant and they'll do it up properly for Pete's sake and maybe you'll actually sell a few. They might even be able to kick down that DDD tape hiss a bit. It's also too danged expensive given even the putative late recording date--it shouldn't be more than $120 under any circumstances. I got mine for less than $40 at a classical cut-outs and deletions place.<br /><br />Conclusion: This whole situation is sad. Jorg Demus is a great pianist and he obviously loves Schumann. Schumann's piano music is worth the effort. This should be a well-known and highly-regarded set and I'm happier with this than with any other big box of piano I may own, short of a Brahms set.ad.

B000062YAZ|1.0|Don't get me wrong; a lot of thrash metal is fast paced and aggressive yet melodic interesting to listen to and well written at the same time.  On the other hand this pitiful waste of plastic by no means comes underneath the first 2 categories only, which is just a pure lack of talent.  The 1 star i have given this piece of s**t for is for the opening track angel of death which isn't really that great but in comparison to the other 9 songs is amazing, and that's really saying something!!. <br /> <br />I honestly can't believe my eyes when I read through all these 5 star reviews which applaud it stating in some extreme occasions that it's the \\"greatest thrash metal CD ever\\".  It appears that a large majority of thrash metal fans are tone deaf or have an I.Q. not much higher than their shoe size.  The following things are what is terribly wrong with this album:  The guitar work is basically the same in every fu**ing track, the drumming also has no variety and seems to be some sort of personal competition to see how many kick drum beats he an churn out every second, Tom Araya'a vocals are probably the most boring, dull and untalented ever recorded, the lyrics have about the same intelligence, originality and variety as my 5 year old brother could write and I don't even have a 5 year old brother !!. Finally the song structures are some of the most poorly planned out bog standard structures I've ever heard with sudden tempo changes and guitar solos which consist of a bunch of random notes strung together and played fast to make them look amazing when really their plain ret**ded. <br /> <br />If your lucky enough to own a brain with some brains cells in it unlike 98 percent of the brain dead reviewers in the customers comments list and are looking to get in to thrash metal, by master of puppets or and justice for all by \\"Metallica\\" or peace sells or rust in peace by \\"Megadeth\\", definitely not this waste of plastic, time or money, which is a complete rip off considering the albums 28 minutes of noise pollution. <br />
B00005JMYI|5.0|The plot of Anchorman follows the chronicles of a popular yet chauvanistic news anchorman named Ron Burgundy (played by Will Farrell)and his equally chauvanistic news team. It is set in the 70s when broadcasting was a mans game. Their equilibrium is distrubed when an attractive blonde lady joins the newsteam, and brings with her feministic views, hilarity ensues. <br /> <br />In my opinion Will Ferrell is on top form in this film, and the film is soley based around his kind of humour. if you enjoyed his roles in Elf, Oldschool and Wedding Crashers youll love Anchorman. Christina Applegate plays the role of Ron's love interest well and brings some elements of humour with her. The majority of the humour is based around the ignorant and sexist attitudes of Ron and his news team, however there are also some goofball elements included such as the rivallary between various news teams. <br /> <br />Overall any fan of Ben Stiller, Wilson Owen or Vince Vaughn will love Anchorman, definetly worth buying!
6305128952|4.0|Redford's character may not have breached modern values in hitting on the married woman but he breached the values implicit in his tenured typecasting mold which made his potential homewrecker agenda a little tough to swallow. The infidelity thing did nothing to advance the theme but created an additional plot layer which at best weakly resolved itself and skewed the ending blandly.
B000EGCITG|5.0|While I don't own the previous album (only the first two), I feel that this collection is the best showcase of what P!nk is all about.  From her acoustic ballad roots as a youth to cutting edge pop/R&B of today - the whole album is stamped with her signature \\"style\\".  Maybe it has something to do with the fact she produced this one herself.  Or maybe that she's just matured and feels comfortable marching to her own beat...who really knows! <br /> <br />This is the only P!nk album I can listen to start to finish.  While \\"Stupid Girls\\" is a clinical, radio-ready single - at least the lyrics are different from run-of-the-mill songs about puppy love.  Plus the beat is great.  The next track \\"Who Knew\\" is deep and well performed.  \\"Mr. President\\" starts off in a very unexciting way, but by the end you feel like giving P!nk a high-five - unless you're pro-G.W. (I was a little disappointed that the Indigo Girls mainly supplied backing vocals on the track though).  My personal favorites are \\"U + Ur Hand\\" which has edgy-rock sound and very understandable to any woman who has had to deal with the 'bar scene' and \\"The One That Got Away\\" which is an tight acoustic ballad that really proves that P!nk is a real singer and just not a cute face lip-syncing in a music video. <br /> <br />My only gripe with the album (which won't bother many people, I realize) is that at times the profanity in the songs sounds gimmicky.  Many tunes are musically sound and could have a wider appeal if not \\"tainted\\" by four letter word such-and-such.  But I guess that's what radio-edits are for!  P!nk should be very proud of this latest release.  It shows that even in today's cut throat music industry;  some truly talented artists can be unique and popular at the same time.  Plus it's still an asset to be able to sing well.
B000EGCITG|5.0|OK, this album is almost impossible to describe in words.. other than it's totally awesome.  I don't know what's happened to Pink in the last couple of years since she released the uneven but enjoyable Try This, but this is Missundaztood times 10.<br /><br />I don't find the song-by-song breakdowns terribly helpful because every song resonates differently to each listener, but if you even REMOTELY enjoyed Missundaztood, this CD is going to go straight to the top of your playlist and stay there for quite a while.  Overflowing with confidence, in-your-face girl power and a bristling indictment of her 'peers' who unfortunately have to sell T&A instead of talent, this album is an absolute tour de force.  You won't be sorry.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Another Awesome Cd from Pink.  All of the songs are great on this cd especially stupid girls and the hidden track \\"I have seen the rain\\" which she sings with her father.  a must by for any pink fan!!
0618164413|2.0|This book is great in that it has all of the Curious George stories in one place. Unfortunately, that makes it incredibly heavy and hard to hold with a squirming kid on your lap. <br /> <br />I'd buy a set of the individual books, even at a higher price. <br /> <br />On the upside, my daughter loves the George stories and wants them read to her nightly before sleep. We've had to learn how to read portions of each book to keep her interested and awake. <br />
B000E6UK5K|4.0|A very floyd-ish sound. Which is why you are reading this. right? Anyway it has some great textures and like others mentioned, Gilmores voice hasnt changed a bit. In some tunes it may be a little over-processed but no mistaking its him. The guitar work is great...very smooth soaring harmonies etc. There are some great instrumental pieces. It is a great CD to throw in the player and fall asleep to. I mean that in a good way---I guess its kind of like Easy-listening floyd. I was always hoping and expecting that at some point it would explode into something intense and a bit angry, but it never does...which is kind of a bummer. Gilmour in his last interview talked very much about being content and this is a reflection of that contentment. Maybe something will anger him soon and he can put out something a little more lively. At first I was a bit disappointed but it has grown on me.  Like another reviewer stated, I think he could do this type of CD every year if he wanted...theres nothing new musically in it for him really- I think it is just more of a project of doing nearly everything on his own, the production etc... maybe he's a bit bored, I dunno. Anyways, it floydish and a good listen.
0684803356|5.0|This is a great novel perhaps approaching a masterpiece and part of the enjoyment is the drama; so, I have not described the plot elements and those should be left as surprises for the reader.<br /><br />I had read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Hemingway and was reading an essay by Raymond Chandler, the famous detective writer and screenplay writer of the 1930s through to the 1950s. He made the comment in his essay stating that \\"Farewell to Arms\\" set the standard for twentieth century fiction. With that encouragement I bought the book, read it, then ran out and bought most of Hemingway's other novels and a collection of his short stories. This novel from 1939 is his among his best works, and perhaps \\"Farewell to Arms\\" would be his best novel. Some of his other works such as \\"Sun Also Rises\\" does not have the depth and balance of the present work. This is among Hemingway's best with a good balance of prose, story, characters, and drama. It is one of his longer novels - most are short or about 300 pages - and this present book approaches 500 pages.<br /><br />The Bloomsbury Guide has picked 375 top fiction authors, and among those 375 has picked 40 \\"masterpieces\\" and they include Hemingway's \\"Farewell to Arms.\\"  His contemporary, F. Scott Fitzgerald did not have any of his novels among the top 40, and there is only a select group of American writers in the Bloomsbury guide - which includes all writers. Other masterpieces include Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary,\\" Lawrence's \\"Sons and Lovers,\\" Tolstoys's \\"War and Piece\\" and Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" - as a sample. \\"Farewell to Arms\\" is shorter, more concise, and has more punch or drama than the present novel.<br /><br />The story is about the fight by the partisans or guerrillas in the Spanish mountains fighting during the Spanish civil war of the late 1930s. It involves Robert Jordan, a young American, and a girl Maria. It is part love story and part a war story. Hemingway visited Spain as a war correspondent during the period. Overall, it lacks the drama and action of \\"Farewell to Arms\\" and is a bit rambling by comparison.<br /><br />The prose is simply outstanding - as in other Hemingway novels - and the opening of the book is unforgettable:<br /><br />\\"He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees. The mountainside sloped gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass. There was a stream alongside the road and far down the pass he saw a mill beside the stream and the falling water of the dam, white in the summer sunlight.\\"<br /><br />That prose is very similar to his masterpiece: \\"Farewell to Arms.\\"<br /><br />Part of the fun reading the book is the plot and I would avoid knowing any more than that until you read the book. The prose is exceptional and on par with Fitzgerald, Henry James, Bellow, and similar writers.<br /><br />5 Star masterpiece.and action of \\"Farewell to Arms\\" and is a bit rambling by comparison.

B000B4KZZA|4.0|The hard rock blast of Get Ready For Love with its tempo variation opens Abbatoir Blues. Cannibal's Hymn is a slow but intense rock ballad and is followed by the somewhat messy but equally powerful Hiding All Away. The music but not the lyrics, lightens up with the subdued love song Messiah Ward. There She Goes My Beautiful World with its disturbing imagery and edgy rhythmic patterns is a tour de force.<br /><br />Nature Boy, a driving rock song with a beautiful melody and poetic lyrics, is one of the highlights. The mid-tempo track Let The Bells Ring is another track with a nervous beat and a lovely chorus. This CD concludes with Fable Of The Brown Ape, a slow number with a complex arrangement. Abattoir Blues contains mostly harder rock songs that sound messy at first listen but make sense after repeated spins. Perhaps it could be considered as Nick Cave's very own Exile On Main Street.<br /><br />More melodious, the Orpheus CD has a gentler overall sound and more immediately memorable compositions. The title track is a long story song in a bluesy vein. It is followed by the tuneful Breathless, an exquisitely beautiful love song which is one of my favourites. The atmospheric Babe You Turn Me On is another tender ballad with a gorgeous melody. After the meandering interlude of Easy Money comes the uptempo rock of Supernaturally that becomes quite rousing in the chorus.<br /><br />The subdued Spell has a dreamy quality as has the next one, Carry Me, with its moving spiritual undertone. The Orpheus CD concludes with O Children, a ruminative song with a gospel feel. This double album is an impressive showcase of Cave's multifaceted talents. Rock fans will prefer Abattoir Blues but I find the contemplative Orpheus more appealing. More exact rating: Four and a half stars.
B00005JOFQ|3.0|I heard about Brokeback for six months.  From all the hype, I anticipated a sweeping love story between two cowboys.  I anticipated scenes of highly charged but tastefully photographed lovemaking between two men.    That's not what I finally saw.  I watched an unsatisfying tale of tormented love between two men who meet for twenty years and usually bicker like an old, married, straight couple.  The controversial sex scenes?  But one, and it is a fully-clothed scene more akin to rape than an expression of love.  It was as painful to watch as it would be to experience.    In short, Brokeback continues a theme long advanced by Hollywood: Queers cannot be happy; queers cannot have good sex.  Have we not advanced an iota since the infamous Boys in the Band, which opened in 1970?    The endlessly discussed Great Gay Love Story was actually the least interesting aspect of Brokeback.  Far more interesting is what should have been the central theme: Two men who don't fit into society.  You know, cowboys.  Repeat: cowboys.  Ennis and Jack are far more at home in the sweeping, breathtaking expanse of wild America than they are in their respective cramped city apartment and suburban home.  This tension is the best part of the movie.      Also interesting is the complicated relationships between the men and their wives and families.  Ang Lee would have you believe that the impediment to Jack and Ennis finding happiness as married men was their sexual orientation.  Sorry, the impediment was largely their inability to connect with mainstream expectations.  The men were only happy on Brokeback and suffocated in other roles - cowboys first; queers second.    Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance and he should have won the Academy Award.  He was wholly believable as an inarticulate cowboy.  A dazzling performance.    Here's my version of Brokeback; it's about 95% the same.  What is different is that Ennis and Jack never have sex or express any kind of love even though theymeet for twenty years on Brokeback.  Instead of bickering, each man finds peace in the wild - a break from the endless demands, frustrations, and disempowerment they experience in their city lives.      Then Ennis discovers that his friend has died in...a car crash.  He doesn't know how to react.  He calls the widow who explains that Jack's family won't allow Jack's ashes to be scattered on Brokeback.  Ennis dutifully goes to the parents and the scene plays out almost - but not precisely - as Lee filmed it.  Jack's homophobic father offers exactly the same creepy speech but Ennis shifts uncomfortably.  He's confused and thinks: What is the old man insinuating?  Meanwhile, Jack's mother looks knowingly at Ennis - just as Lee filmed.  She then offers the perplexed man the opportunity of visiting Jack's bedroom.  Ennis goes upstairs and finds his old shirt encased in Jack's shirt; the camera has a close-up of his face as he slowly realizes: Jack loved me.  A few moments pass as Ennis's face contorts with the belated knowledge that he was in love with Jack as well.  He breaks down in heaving sobs.  As he departs the Twist home the scene plays out exactly as Lee filmed.  (Roberta Maxwell as Jack's mother also offers a dazzling performance.  Has ever so much been conveyed with so little?)    When we later watch Ennis in his trailer (and after the lovely scene with his daughter), the story again plays out as Lee filmed except for the last scene.  Ennis opens the closet and reveals the Two Shirts.  As the camera stays on his back, we hear a door open.  A hand appears and massages Ennis's neck.  Then a stubble-covered face proffers a gentle kiss on the bare neck.  We then hear: \\"It's OK to miss `em still, Ennis.\\"     The two men look at each other.  Their eyes are radiant with love.  They kiss.    Fade to black.    Happy at last.

B00006AFUR|2.0|So the guy is a good actor...he should STICK to acting.  When I heard the guy had his own band I figured I'd check it out. Overall I was very dissapointed, not being able to find even one song I really liked on this cd.  While it's not flat out horrible, it's pretty much a waste of money if you consider yourself a rock fan.  Its kind of an Alt. Rock Industrial who knows what...which wouldn't be so bad if the songs had some hooks or the slightest hint of being catchy; but these songs are mostly all boring filler at best.  If you like the samples then more power to ya but I definitely reccomend giving it a listen before you buy or you might be dissapointed.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|What more can be said about Ang Lee's moving film \\"Brokeback Mountain\\"? It seems like a waste of time to review a film where so much has been said already. Haters who have never seen the film are not going to listen anyway and will give all the praiseful reviews 1 star. So, without going into the details of the script, acting and cinematography, all of which are top-notch, I will say that I found the film to be a tragedy of two people's lives who try to live within societal norms instead of following what is inside their hearts. Of course, their actions create a domino effect, with the lives of their wives and families being affected as well. Moving, complicated and heartfelt, this is a film that you won't soon forget. Too bad that the dvd doesn't contain a commentary.
B00008EYA5|4.0|I saw this movie on t.v. for the first time a few days ago and now I'm buying the DVD. I'm not a big fan of action movies but I do watch them now and again. I've read quite a few negative reviews about this film and I think they are undeserved. When I saw it I thought it was good, not Diehard good, but it held its own. I really enjoyed it. I really liked the idea that they included a female member of SWAT. One never sees a woman SWAT member. It looks like this is one of those movies you either love, like, or hate. One has to make up one's own mind.

B00005JOE8|4.0|This one will be short. I've never read the original comic this film was apparently based on, but I saw such lavish praise directed at it that I felt compelled to view it anyway. The movie takes place in the near future in England, under the control of a fictitious government. Natalie Portman's character, Evee (is that how it's spelled?) is caught wandering about after curfew by some officers. Just as they were about to go police brutality on her ass, which would have been the best scene in the movie, an enigmatic masked man appears and slays them with his knives. He introduces himself as \\"V,\\" via pseudo-intellectual jargon, and implores her to join him in an event he promises would be unlike anything she has ever seen. I feel it would be inappropriate for me to ramble on about the plot from this point, so I'll get to the meat and potatoes. V For Vendetta is, of course, is a politically inciting film. It blurs the line between heroism and terrorism, raising some interesting questions that go beyond how we define our words. Unfortunately, some of the political commentary came off as a bit ham-fisted and obvious, if anything. (The highly conservative and religious leader, for instance. Gee whiz, could that be Bill Clinton?) But overall, the message is compelling and its routes stem from how we define our lives, moreso than politics. The film's acting is remarkable for the most part, though Natalie Portman doesn't really impress. The Wachowski brothers had their part in the action scenes I'm aware, and (thankfully) there's no bullet-time or other matrix cliches. The action flows very well.<br /><br />All that aside, V... stands as one of the best sci-fi stories I've seen as of late. Dark yet whimsical, the plot never degenerates into self-parody or a tepid display of CGI, unlike a certain other big sci-fi release. The character V is an achetypical charming aristocratic type, but the stereotype is evidently intended. This is the case for all of the characters, and it never hinders the experience. There are a few dubious coincidences, or perhaps even plot holes, though. Strange V would have a military detainment center in his home, for such a petty purpose as it was used. The entire detainment scene felt a bit convoluted, and the subplot involving the note Evee found in that rathole felt tacked on. But... The movie has sort of a lucid, dreamlike feel,  and insignificant stuff like that isn't supposed to be picked apart by over-analytical minds. In the end, it's the message that's most prevalent. This review felt a bit directionless since I'm running out of time, but I feel that an unfocused train of thought is somehow appropriate for a movie like this. So yeah, it was good, see it,<br /><br />- Thus says the Pellingtonnever hinders the experience. There are a few dubious coincidences, or perhaps even plot holes, though.

B00005JKZV|4.0|Unlike the Empire Strikes Back or the Godfather Part II which can stand on its own, the Two Towers in many ways needs its preceeding and succeeding films Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. The filmmakers do an admirable job of bringing the story to life and make a couple decisions that surely angered fans but all in all it's a great film with one of the best achievements in CG characters and a cool end battle. <br /> <br />We follow 3 distinct storylines: Frodo and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor with the Ring, only now they have a companion in Gollum, an incredibly skinny and mentally messed up creature who happens to have another personality. 2nd story is Pippin and Merry who were captured by Uruk-Hai and have to deal with the Ents, talking trees, for help. 3rd story is Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli tracking down the Hobbits only to end up in Rohan and have to defend a big place named Helm's Deep against at least 10,000 Uruk-Hai. <br /> <br />They're have been several advancements in the realm of digital effects: the water tentacle in the Abyss, the T-1000 in Terminator 2, living dinosaurs in Jurassic Park and bullet time from the Matrix. Well add Gollum to the list as he's not only one of the best achievements in visual effects but he can actually act on screen. It's helped by Andy Serkis whose movements were digitally recorded by computer and animators made it look like Gollum. Plus his voice is really cool, I do it plenty of times at home. <br /> <br />One of the big controversies(among fans anyway) was moving Frodo and Sam's encounter with a big spider named Shelob to film 3, Return of the King. Yeah it's at the end of Two Towers book but chronologically it's supposed to be in film 3, during the Pelennor Fields battle. If it was here, people would go \\"hey wait a minute! Shelob is not after Helm's Deep, it's during the battle at Minas Tirith!\\" You can see how fan devotion can sometimes have its problems. <br /> <br />It is the middle film soit's a bit more difficult than Film 1 or 3. It doesn't really have a proper beginning and the ending is slightly cliffhanger-esque. But there's very little to complain such as the CG, music and the characters. Although the Warg attack looks very low budget. All in all, Fellowship's probably my favorite of the 3 with some of the best looking locations but this film does have Gollum and Helm's Deep and the hotness that is Mirando Otto so all is well. <br /> <br />It helps to watch the films in order as while Two Towers isn't terrible by any means, its inability as a stand alone film is a flaw.
B000E33VWW|4.0|I rented this movie because the movie I wanted to watch was out. This turned out to be a totally different movie then I thought it was going to be. Capote is about the famous author (\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's),Truman Capote and how he got the idea to write the book \\"In Cold Blood\\", about a real life killing in Kansas of a farm family of four and how he went about the process of writing it.  He is very manipulative and selfish.  He befriends the sheriff's department all the way to the actual men accused of this gruesome crime (he bribed the prison warden)all so he could write his book. Its a good movie and I found it highly entertaining and Philip Seymour Hoffman did an excellent job as usual. This book ends up consuming him and its the last book he ever wrote.  The movie hooks you in the beginning and keeps you entralled until the end. I would recommend watching this movie.
B0000T70K4|4.0|\\"Cosmopolis\\" by Don DeLillo is a story about the powers of greed, lust and revenge as seen through the eyes of post-modern nostalgia and technology obsession. Written in DeLillo's characteristically poetic and often harmonic lyrical tone, the story is wrapped up in certain sadness and longing after the basic human emotions lost in a society stricken by the plague of information technology, heartless bits of 1's and 0's, media driven global financial markets and of course the demonic obsession with money.<br /><br />The pages seem soaked in this cold blue neon light of radiating motion, of brutal cause and effect relationships, of sorrowful physiological weaknesses. At the center sits a powerful yet uncharacteristically young broker who proceeds to gamble away his fortune against the movements of the Japanese yen (against his instincts and nature) from the comfort of his mobile office (his limousine).<br /><br />The book is worth exploring, if not for the story, for its honest and open narrative that does not cringe or retract when exposing the shameful but realistic qualities of the human physique. I recommend this book for those readers who are interested in DeLillo's unforgettable language talent.<br /><br />- by Simon Cleveland
B00004RF9B|4.0|Released in 1956, I didn't see \\"Forbidden Planet\\" until a full 40 years later. I've seen it three more times since then and here's what strikes me:<br /><br />For one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in \\"Forbidden Planet,\\" which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!). You name it: warp drive, Captain/First Officer/Doctor triumvirate, babe in ultra-sexy outfits, beam down/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in \\"Forbidden Planet.\\"<br /><br />The invisible id monster is truly horrifying when finally viewed. It looks like a serious rendition of the Tasmanian Devil.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this brief paragraph if you don't want to know the monster's true identity. The concept that the monster is, in reality, the personification of Dr. Morbius' lower subconscious nature (i.e. the id, \\"flesh\\" or carnal psyche) is a fascinating revelation. ***END SPOILER*** I wasn't at all expecting such mature commentary in a 50's sci-fi flick.<br /><br />Furthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is fascinating to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well.<br /><br />One thing that really blows me away every time I catch this flick, of course, is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira (or Alta for short), in her ultra skimpy (and cute) outfits. It doesn't matter what profound matters are going on in the film, if she's present in a scene with one of her various outfits, my eyes are completely focused on HER -- in utter awe of her jaw-dropping beauty. If you're a red-blooded male and think I'm kidding, check out the flick and see for yourself.<br /><br />I've heard some people complain about the scene where we are led to believe that Alta (Francis) is skinny-dipping, only to plainly observe that she's wearing a loose skin-colored bathing suit. Is this a cop-out on the film-maker's part because it was 1956? Not at all because the bathing suit is clearly visible once she steps out of the water. Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!).<br /><br />Please remember that \\"Forbidden Planet\\" is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come.<br /><br />GRADE: Amaker's part because it was 1956?

B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I bought this movie because I adored Kiera Knightly in Pirates of the Carribean.<br /><br />At the same time, I purchased the 1995 BBC mini-series. On watching the two back-to-back, there just is no comparison.  The 1995 version is simply wonderful with a great deal of depth.  Of course, you can get deeper in five hours than you can two!<br /><br />Watching the Kiera Knightly version, didn't peak my interest to actually read Pride & Prejudice, but the 1995 version did.<br /><br />I wish that more of Jane Austin had been used in this version of the movie.  Many changes were made to lines to appeal to a younger audience, but not for the better.  Jane Austin's are hard to improve upon.<br /><br />However, The cinematography was beautiful and I did like that Meryton was shown more the way that it might have been at the time.<br /><br />Overall, I found the movie cute and with no depth.  Good try, but if you have time go for the BBC mini-series version!
B00005JOFQ|3.0|Brokeback Mountain, so the media said, was the most gut-wrenching love story of the year. But, where was the love? Jack (played Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis (played by Heath Ledger) seemed more like really good buddies, who just happened to have sex with each other because there were no women around. They horsed around (no pun intended), drank, fought, and shot the s***. Even when they did appear to share their emotions, neither one ever uttered the word \\"love.\\" The closest the audience comes to seeing that they are truly in love is when Ennis becomes jealous of Jack's gay dalliances in Mexico. Only love or hate can inspire such a strong emotion as jealousy, and from their years of being sex buddies we know that they didn't hate each other.<br /><br />All in all, Brokeback Mountain was a solid, good movie. Heath Ledger was perfect as Ennis-the tight-lipped and emotionally congested cowboy. The only time he ever let his guard down or succumbed to the niceties of people was when he was with Jack. (He allowed Jack to tenderly caress him, and found rest by snuggling in his arms.) The only emotion he ever let himself show in public was violence. I got the sense that when he got into fights with other men he was really trying to beat up himself. For that performance, Heath Ledger deserved all the accolades he received and may have even been jerked by the Academy for an Oscar. (Michelle Williams and Jake Gyllenhaal also turned in Oscar-worthy performances.)<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal used his lanky frame and doe-eyes to his best advantage as the bull rider with the fantastical dreams of domestic bliss with Ennis. From the first time Jack reached out to Ennis, you knew that it was over for him. Jack turned him out, but it was Ennis who held the power in the relationship by being the emotional recluse-forcing Jack to always reach out for him. Jack was as starved for emotional reciprocation as Ennis' long-suffering wife, Alma. Jack and Alma were constantly waiting for Ennis to say the there magic words that they, themselves, were afraid to say in case they didn't get the answer they wanted. His presence, as Alma learned the hard way, was not a guarantee of his love.<br /><br />Again, I ask, where was the love? It was deep down somewhere in Ennis, where even Ennis was unable to touch and that was the biggest flaw of Brokeback Mountain. Nobody could reach Ennis's heart.is to say the there magic words that they, themselves, were afraid to say in case they didn't get the answer they wanted.

0684824906|5.0|I was actually blown away by this book.  So impressed was I that I actually sent my copy to Dr. Kearns-Goodwin and asked her to autograph it and to tell her how absolutely fascinated I was by this historical document.  While as some other reviewers have mentioned, yes, there is familiar territory covered, Kearns-Goodwin touches on some of the interest that occupies many of the subject matter usually written or presented in documentaries regarding Lincoln.  Instead of Kearns-Goodwin focusing on Mrs. Lincoln's apparent mania (well-documented in other reads), or Lincon's possible \\"relationships\\" with other men (discussed in other authors works as well), I was absolutely fascinated and engrossed by the portrait of a deeply thoughtful and empathetic individual, Abraham Lincoln, the likes of whom we will never again see in this lifetime.  \\"Team of Rivals\\" focuses on the character study of Lincoln's presidential cabinet.  She provides quite thorough details that provide in-depth character studies of these rather complex individuals who in spite of their own ambitions, jealousies, undermining and with some, blatant contempt and disrespect for their President, Lincoln, with his brilliancy to directly empathize and thoughtfully ward-off possible anarchy within his own cabinet, used what I can only convey as his brilliancy to guide a nation on the brink of collapse through an absolutely terrible time in the history of the United States.  We learn about these cabinet members personal lives and personalities (read Amazon review), and as I was so engrossed in this work, I could not believe the patience of Lincoln and his ability to deal with such a volatile time and volatile individuals.  I actually felt as if I were there--in the 1800's and felt every nuance Kearns-Goodwin brought up about each individual.  She spares the reader from the usual \\"gossip,\\" focusing more on the \\"Team of Rivals,\\" and is actually able to convincingly enter the mind of Lincoln--a complex man who so many \\"rivals\\" believed was such a low-life \\"hick,\\" and experience how Lincoln truly saved the Union and how he silently suffered in doing so.  Because, as Kearns-Goodwin details how Linclon always foremost listened to himself (and gave the courtesy and respect of always taking the time to listen to others, whether or not he agreed with what they had to say), yet never (or rarely) scoffed at those who were so impatient with him for believing he never acted quickly enough or in the interest of the Union, Kearns-Goodwin has brought a fascinating portrait of a man who is probably the greatest American, next to G. Washington, to have lived.  As Lincoln's \\"depression\\" is well-known, to paraphrase a section in the book dealing with Lincoln's suicidal tendencies (I believe referred to as his dark-days of the 1840's), Lincoln confesses to his friend Joshua Speed that what prevents him from hanging himself from a tree is that he will die knowing that he never acomplished anything for which he would be remembered.  Fast forward to the Emancipation Proclamation, a major historical event at which Speed is in attendance--he tells Speed to remember back when he wanted to hang himself but did not because he would not have left any mark on this world--he said that he believed that if he did nothing else, he would probably be remembered for the Emancipation Proclomation.  Wow.    His assasination a few weeks after the end of the war is so tragic because we all know the failure of the Reconstruction.  It certainly begs the question that would the Reconstruction have succeeded should Lincoln have been there to guide this monumental task?      If you want to read a well-researched historical novel, you will not be disappointed with this fascinating account of our sixteenth President and his \\"team of rivals...\\"  All of whom guided this country through U.S. history's darkest days.  Absolutely fascinating.  One is often taught in school about \\"honest Abe\\":  Kearns-Goodwin seems to have made this point--Lincoln is, in my opinion, perhaps the last honest man...

B0000CEB4V|5.0|What a talented song writer, and what a great concert tribute.  Highlights for me included Sam Brown's rousing version of \\"Horse To The Water\\", Gary Brooker's up tempo \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" and Ringo Starr's excellent performance of \\"Photograph\\".  All in all, every performance on here was excellent, and it was great to see Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr play together on stage.
6304708521|2.0|The most devoted Beatlemaniac will have difficulty sitting through this self-indulgent TV movie. \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" (1967) is best remembered for its music-video incarnations of \\"I Am the Walrus,\\" \\"Fool on the Hill\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know.\\" Despite moments of surrealist whimsy, the Beatles' lack of cinematic prowess is painfully evident. The soundtrack album remains a superior investment.
B000B0WODA|1.0|Maybe a year ago, I got the first Franz Ferdinand CD... I didnt think much of it. At first I liked it, and then it just got old. Sooner or later it was forgotten under my bed and it hasn't been touched since.<br /><br />The second album of theirs isnt better than the first. Usually artists experience some growth in their music, and their second or third album doesnt sound exactly like the first album. Franz Ferdinand however, is different. This is like the follow-up of the first album, and all of the songs sound the same. Jesus, even in the first album all of their songs sound alike. Its one, long, annoying 56 minute song.<br /><br />This band blows...so save your money and go and buy some real music.
B000002KY8|5.0|Released in 1982, Prince's hard-driving double album was his first recorded masterwork. \\"1999\\" holds up beautifully and features a wealth of terrific music: \\"Little Red Corvette,\\" \\"Delirious,\\" \\"Automatic,\\" \\"Let's Pretend We're Married,\\" \\"D.M.S.R.\\" and the apocalyptic title track. Breakthrough rock and funk from one of the medium's few geniuses.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Ennis and Jack are two farm hands wandering from job to job--end up being hired together, and find each other. Consider the environment-backwoods, poor and lacking in education scenario where gay was treated worst than the plague, no different than the KKK's early treatment of blacks (which still goes on these days in many parts of this country). Ennis and Jack, well they \\"found\\" each other, had sex, and parted when the job's contract was up--and both ended up living separate lives getting married and even had kids. Yet throughout the 20 years they would get together from time to time, and the impact it had on these two mens' lives...as well as their wives and kids. It treated such things actually in an incredibly sensitive manner, suprisingly. I'm sure such things happened many times. The tragedies occurred NOT due to the homosexuality, but the REPRESSION of it and the devistating consequences of trying to live a lie, and how living such a lie may impact on other people; as well as society's (oftentimes legal) prejudice against gays as a whole. <br /> <br />I really didn't find the movie that heartbreaking, and the first 45 to 50 minutes actually bored me. I've seen far more emotional movies (not of the gay genre) that winning so many awards perplexed me. It was a GOOD movie. I've seen much more emotional movies than this. It did not make me cry or anything like that, although it was touching.  <br />   <br />I HIGHLY recommend renting this movie. Note there is some nudity in this movie-be aware of this.  <br /> <br />I guess my only real complaint at times I found it very hard to understand-I can't stand it when an actor mumbles.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I kept hearing \\"Put Your Records On\\" via Virgin Radio and finally found out who sang it. Rarely do I buy a disc based on one song, but I was right - the record is fantastic.

B000059QYB|5.0|Billy Idol is a potent blend of punk, new wave, hard rock, and and a touch of glam. Unlike those idiots nowadays who are trying to promote the \\"new wave revival\\", Billy Idol actually has talent. His vocal range is quite excellent, and the keyboards obviously play an important part in the music. The music is fun, yet complex. I'm not even a big fan of punk and this caught my eye. Avoid garbage like the Killers, the Strokes, and crap like that. This is the real deal.
B00008977N|5.0|I don't know, maybe my DVD player is broken, but I don't think it is that grainy at all.  Definitely nothing to complain about.  And the sound quality is excellent.   <br /> <br />Paula Cole is beautiful and she sounds great!  Also includes one of the most entertaining drummers ever.  Maybe the sound on Growing Up Live (another GREAT concert video) has a little more punch, but that can be contributed to the different drummer's style.  The guitar only adds, never draws attention away.  And Tony Levin... does it get any better? <br /> <br />If you don't simply LOVE the show, all you have to do is watch it again because you obviously weren't paying attention the first time. <br /> <br />Highlights (for me) are \\"Come talk to me\\", \\"Secret World\\", and \\"Blood of Eden\\".   <br /> <br />Watching something this good makes you feel that you are somehow participating in the work of art.  It is that engaging. <br /> <br />And then, when you're an all out PG fan, get your hands on a copy of the POV video.  Search for it.  (Buy the boot rip.)  It is more than worth it.
B000E1155E|3.0|I?m not an English speaker so you have to excuse me for my poor writing. Don't get me wrong, but I really think you have to distrust any pop product which goes from super unknown to be the best brit act since Oasis, Beatles, Blur... in just a matter of weeks, getting the prize as Best Brit-Pop Band and being called \\"the saviors of rock\\" and all that stuff ...I mean do you really believe that we have finally we arrived at that magical- always -dreamed -utopian age when masses, great talent, music critics, music industry awards and radio stations could completely agree? I read about the Monkeys in the BCC's entertainment news website and was so curious that immediately got some of their music. It was OK, fun... kind of fresh... I recommended it to some friends, but then I saw how everyone around me were developing this kind of frantic -neurotic -cultlike -induced -euphoria about the band. And then my natural response was to object the hype. I mean... yes, to hear them could be a nice little ride.... But, come on, I cannot believe you cannot recall a million recent bands that sound exactly the same as the Monkeys... they have this 70s blues inspired and garage sound that we have come to relate to such acts like the White Stripes or even Jet...YES!!! They display the same basic rock aesthetic: simple and direct playing, low quality production values, street wise rude lyrics about anecdotic topics of some lousy teen life... I have this friend who believes the Monkeys have rediscovered the pleasure of pure and basic, no-studio-overwork mediated rock in what he calls an era of \\"overwhelming techno induced experimental\\" pop. Unless my friend were frozen since the late 90s I don't know what the h....he's talking about... cause the Monkeys sound is just the last stop of a rock sound who is in it's way since 2001, if not early. Besides that, the drumming is good, but not inventive or inspired; the songs are too emotionally one dimensional and too much same-sounding for my taste, there's an excessive lack of guitar solos -check the marvelous ones in the new Strokes album- and the musical bridges and instrumental passages just mediocre and boring. The Monkeys have fun, but it's the kind of fun of movie trailers and teasers that entertains you before the main feature, the big movie you're where hopping to see, starts and the real show begins.
B000EGCITG|4.0|Wow, what a come back.  For a while there, I was begining to be scared that Pink was going downhill.  Pink came into the buisness as an r&b singer with her album Can't Take Me Home, while it was a decent album Pink hardly had anything different to offer than fellow r&b singers and would have got lost in the flow of the many up and comers.  However, she really shined when she was followed by her most successful attempt Mizundastood, a true pop rock career saving opus that became one of the best selling albums of the year.  However, in just about a years time she followed it up with the bizarre rock flavored Try This! which seemed way too rushed to achieve success, so as a result it quickly flopped.  Her problem might have been she was trying to reinvent herself on just about every album, but alas, Pink's career as brought back to life through her senior album I'm Not Dead.  And this one actually works.<br /><br />Things start off with with the lead single \\"Stupid Girls\\", a true testament to why Pink is the real deal.  However, the song isn't quite as impressive without the video, which is the real magic behind the actual song.  However, I predict \\"U + Ur Hand\\" will light the air waves on fire.  \\"U + Ur Hand\\" is a song with a chorus so slick you could place butter on it and it would still slide off, so as a result I predict it to do well on radio.  But the real gem is \\"Dear Mr. President\\", a true lyrical treat (and thank heavens for a GOOD anti-Bush song.)  \\"How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?/ How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?\\", words never more personal and heartfelt from Pink.<br /><br />Thankfuly the magic doesn't end there.  She continues her good fortune with \\"I Got Money Now\\", the surprisingly good \\"The One That Got Away\\", and the teen-angst \\"Conversation With My 13 Year Old Self\\".  Even the bonus track, a duet with her father, is a nice piece of material.  As a matter of fact, the only song I really didn't care for was \\"Long Way to Happy\\", which sounds like a re-heated left over of \\"Just Like a Pill\\".<br /><br />I have always liked Pink, I even consider her as one of the best singers in the industry today.  Her voice maintains a rasp that she can actually channel it into a fiece vocal machine as opposed to fellow pop-rock up and comers Ashlee Simpson and Lindsay Lohan.  And I think its good to see some more legitimate pop rock from more than just Kelly Clarkson.  Mizundastood was a great album, sure, but I'm Not Dead is without a doubt her strongest material both lyrically and vocally to date.  So it's decided, Pink is without a doubt not dead.  As a matter of fact, I don't think I've ever seen her more alive.ng Way to Happy\\", which sounds like a re-heated left over of \\"Just Like a Pill\\". <br /> <br />I have always liked Pink, I even consider her as one of the best singers in the industry today.

B000068OCS|4.0|If you mask the top & bottom of a film to render it into a letterbox format, you are most definitely losing something.
B00005JKJA|4.0|One hesitates to say anything with certainty about this complex and disturbing film.  Although David Lynch - beneath all of his bizarre and violent imagery - is ultimately a sentimentalist, it is hard to see the silver lining in this film.  After four viewings, I am still unable to tie up all the loose ends, and am even skeptical that I understand anything at all about this movie.   <br /> <br />As I see it, the first two-thirds of the film represent a flashback on the recent events in the life of \\"Betty\\"/Diane Selwyn (wonderfully played by Naomi Watts), an aspiring actress whose career and personal life have gone seriously awry.  Indeed, we eventually find that much of what we thought we knew about Betty/Diane is actually false, and that we have been seeing a self-justifying re-working of her life in which names and faces and facts are jumbled and reassembled into an idealized fiction.  The real facts of her life begin to emerge in the final one-third of the film, yet the actual boundary between fact and fiction always remains unclear.   <br /> <br />The film works at several levels - it is simultaneously a psychological study, a metaphysical statement about the relationship between conscience and the dying process, and a satirical look at Hollywood lifestyles and the inner workings of the film industry.  <br /> <br />As with most of Lynch's films, there is black humor throughout, as when a triple murder is given comic overtones.  There is also some steamy lesbian sex, along with some typical Lynch touches, as in the sinister but comic figure of \\"The Cowboy\\" and the creepy movie executives with laughable personal ideosyncrasies. And, as in \\"Blue Velvet,\\" a Roy Orbison song (\\"Crying\\")is given prominence. <br /> <br />At bottom though, the movie involves a classic love triangle:  Betty/Diane, the beautiful amnesiac Rita (Laura Harring), and the beleagured but ever-cool movie director Adam Kesher (played with aplomb by Justin Theroux, who gives Kesher the look of Elvis Costello).  In Diane's twisted mind, the border between her personality and that of Rita becomes blurred to the point of vanishing, with murderous consequences.   <br /> <br />This is a movie of failed dreams, failed romance, and a descent into madness.  Fans of David Lynch will be kept busy trying to put it all together, and will view it over and over;  others will lose patience and move on to more digestible fare.

B000ENWKN8|1.0|What a waste of money!  These songs seem like leftovers from his last 2 albums.  The only highlight is the last 30 seconds of the disc.  It seemed like Rob left the recording studio and the rest of the band said \\"Screw this.  Let's play something that actually sounds good.\\" <br />I hearby state that I will no longer refer to this band as Rob Zombie.  It shall now be called 'Sherrie Moon's Husband's Band'. <br /> <br />I hate to say it but Scum of The Earth's (Zombie leftovers) put out a better CD than this.
0375931007|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously.  I find myself thinking about Death, and his narrative and the lives of the people so ably portrayed.  The story, set in WWII Munich Germany, could be so grim, but it manages instead to find hope in spite of Hitler, in spite of poverty and hunger, in spite of fear.  The little girl Liesel is so real I feel like I could reach out and touch her.  Her strength of character, and of that of those around her, is inspiring.  Haunting.  As Death does, I find myself wanting to revisit these souls again and again.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I have not read Jonathan Safran Foer's book \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\", and knew nothing of it when sitting down to watch the film adaptation. I only knew that the film starred Elijah Wood and was actor Liev Schreiber's directing debut and it sounded interesting from descriptions I read. So my expectations were pretty modest. I certainly did not expect Schreiber to hit one out of the park his first time up to bat. However, Everything Is Illuminated is indeed a home run and one of the best movies of the year, in my opinion. <br /> <br />Elijah Wood is excellent as Jonathan, a rather odd fellow obsessed with collecting things, particularly as mementos of the past. He travels to the Ukraine and learns a great deal about life, himself, and the future by searching for the past. Also a standout is Eugene Hutz as Jonathan's Ukrainian guide who digs Michael Jackson and wants to be an accountant. Hutz is apparently not an actor, he is the leader of a popular rock band. However, you would never know that he's not an actor, his performance is excellent. The first half of Everything is Illuminated is very humorous, the second half very dramatic. However, the change is tone is very slight. The humor is very funny and the drama is equally potent. The later scenes are very moving and heartfelt without every sinking into cloying sentimentality. The movie from beginning to end is beautifully directed, with wonderful cinematography showcasing the lovely Ukrainian countryside. Schreiber seems to have a very good feeling for visual style. At times it almost reminded of one of my favorite visual stylists: Jean-Pierre Jeunet.   <br /> <br />Everything Is Illuminated is a wonderful movie. Well directed, well written, well acted, and with it's heart in exactly the right place. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you think. Very few directorial debuts turn out this good. In 2004, Zach Braff unleashed Garden State and became an unlikely wunderkind director, in 2005 Liev Schreiber has done the same. This is one of 2005's best movies. Don't miss it.
1881273989|1.0|The original Five Love Languages was insightful, had a variety of examples and provided a good amount of psychological and Christian theory and application.  This book is supposed to be for singles, but almost every example has to do with dating couples--people I don't really consider single.  Rarely does it talk about regular friendship--and when it does, it's guy-girl friendships.  I was hoping to get some insight into my same-sex friendships, family relationships and guy-girl non-romantic friendships, but this book falls horribly short of that.  Get the original copy and just use a little imagination and brain-power to apply it to your single life.  You'll save the time, money and frustration.

0393327655|1.0|The key to understanding what's going on in this book lies in the footnotes to Chapter 7, where the author reveals his personal dedication to Buddhist practice.  In his lengthy footnote 12, he argues that Buddhism \\"is not a religion of faith\\" in spite of the \\"millions of Buddhists who do not seem to know this.\\"   <br /> <br />Oh?  Is, then, the belief of Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso that he is the 14th incarnation of his line to be understood as truth based on observable facts, rather than as faith?  Are the atrocities committed by Japanese Buddhists in China and Singapore during WWII to be dismissed as too insignificant to mention?   <br /> <br />The author judges Buddhism by his personal interpretation of its teachings, rather than by its voluminous mythology or by the beliefs and practices of \\"millions of Buddhists.\\"  If the same standard is applied to other religious traditions, his entire argument falls apart:  every religion (including his own) has produced spiritual adepts who have been powerful voices for peace and self-understanding, as well as masses of nominal believers who think irrationally and, on occasion, behave violently. <br /> <br />It appears to me that the author has written this book to rationalize his personal conversion to Vajrayana Buddhism by claiming that (1) it's really a kind of science, not a religion, and (2) all those other religions are really, really bad anyway.  His analyst could have a field day with this, because it's such  self-serving nonsense.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I came out of this movie feeling extremely confused.    All of my friends had seen it and almost all of them LOVED it, said it was one of the funniest movies they'd ever seen.  Granted, this was before Wedding Crashers came out, but still.      I didn't like it, but that's my personal opinion.  I understand why so many liked it, I think it's a sort of catharsis, which is why people responded to it, even I responded to the character of Napoleon Dynamite.    I admit, I found two scenes hilarious : when he tries to make a jump with the bike, and when he feeds Tina the Llama, which in my opinion is THE BEST character in the movie.    Otherwise, I found it a tad dry, and actually a little offensive.    Watching this movie is like watching a couple of weeks in the life of a high schooler on acid who feeds his llama tuna casserole, which while I agree that some of the humor is subtle, I didn't find it very funny.  Or another view of the movie is that it's poking fun at mentally retarded kids with low IQ's, which is what Napoleon Dynamite pretty much embodies, which I find somewhat offensive, although i'm probably going a little to the extreme here.    Personally, it's not a movie I enjoyed or would recommend, but it is light and if you have nothing else to do, why not?
B000024D4R|5.0|I'd say this is my second favourite Floyd album. (After Wish You Were Here) It's a stronger concept album than WYWH, and musically, is a preview of The Wall. It consists of a short, two part song (Pigs on the wings), which I rather like- interesting lyrics. The bulk of the album is made up of three epic-length songs, \\"Dogs, Pigs, Sheep.\\" They contain some of Roger's most genious lyrics. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who liked The Wall.
067101756X|5.0|I bought this book in 1999.  It was my first real foray into ufology and it really hooked me.  I was working on a \\"swords to plowshares\\" program in the R&D dept of BART.  We were converting \\"Black Program\\" products and interfaced with DARPA.  Consequently, I know a little about the DARPA activities over the years.  As I see it, Corso DID NOT LIE!
0446677450|4.0|I liked the book because it provided me a fresh way of thinking. It is well written and makes for easy reading. It also motivated me to think again about my investment planning. However, I think the bood is little rough on salaried employees. Everybody cannnot be self employed and education at business schools does prepare you to make sound investment and financial decisions. Overall a good buy.
B0007ORU66|4.0|I'm writing this in April of 2006.  <br />I was ten years old in 1970, which, I believe, is the year HEY JUDE was released in the United States as an LP. It was not released in the UK at the time (and I don't know if it's ever been anything but an import there) but I do know that it had an official international release beyond the USA. My brother bought a copy in Mexico in 1971, which had the Apple label (as did the one in the United States.) <br />If memory serves me, ABBEY ROAD, released in 1969, came out and was followed by the HEY JUDE LP, which was followed by LET IT BE. Beatles fans know that LET IT BE was recorded before ABBEY ROAD and that the songs on HEY JUDE spanned the Beatles career, but what is more or less forgotten is that all but two of the songs were not on any LP previously and that, given that this was not released in the UK at the time, this means the United States, and much of the world, had almost a whole album's worth of Beatles material which citizens of the UK had to seek on singles. <br />Since it was an Apple release, I think an argument can be made that the Beatles, who ran Apple, wanted this collection to be released. While they were disappointed with the Capitol releases before SGT. PEPPER'S because the U.S. was leaving off songs or adding songs not intended for the original albums, starting with SGT. PEPPER's the albums were the same in Britain and the United States. (In an exception to this, the UK only had MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR as an EP, while the U.S. release had all the songs from the EP plus several more.) HEY JUDE becomes the final exception to this rule. Up to 1966, the UK had more complete albums, and starting in 1967, the U.S. seems to have had the same albums as the U.K. plus some extras. To realize that in the UK, a fan couldn't get these songs on one album is to realize that, somehow, the UK was deprived of a pretty big chunk of the Beatles' output. <br />It's clear that the first four songs are not in the same mood as therest of the album. It starts with two early songs which had not been on Capitol (Apple being a subsidiary of Capitol --  a subsidiary run by the Beatles, of course.) \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" were available at that time on a United Artists soundtrack to A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. Most of the songs from that album wound up on Capitol's SOMETHING NEW, but, clearly, the inclusion of these two songs on HEY JUDE smacks of contractual negotiation. The next two tracks are from a little later, as the Beatles went psychedelic. (\\"Paperback Writer\\" and \\"Rain.\\") These had been the A and B sides of a single but had not made it to an LP for four years. Still, with these first four songs on the album, it feels like a collection. But for the next two songs on Side 1 and all the songs on Side 2, we're definitely in the late part of the Beatles career. We have \\"Lady Madonna,\\" \\"Revolution\\" (the loud version), \\"Hey Jude,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" and \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko.\\" These six songs have the Beatles playing hard, driven rock and roll with vital lyrics and a real blues sensibility. <br />In a sense, it's a hit collection and the first four songs are clearly not like the reast of the album. But the phrase \\"hit collection\\" can imply a gathering of songs from already existing albums, and that's a bit misleading. HEY JUDE is music from the time of THE WHITE ALBUM, ABBEY ROAD and LET IT BE, and, if it's not an album made as an album, its release in 1970 worked as an album release. It was not a substitute for anything except finding the various singles containing these songs.  <br />The cover (front and back) had two pictures from one of the Beatles final photo sessions. You'll see a film clip of this at the end of THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY. It's used in the ANTHOLOGY as the farewell moment and it makes sense that two images from it wound up on an officially released album in the United States at the end of the Beatles' career as a group.
067101756X|4.0|Before I begin my review, let me clarify that I have only a moderate curiosity in UFO's and such.  I'm not a skeptic or a believer, but someone who sees a field of study that's intriguing, impossible to flat-out dismiss, and at the very least entertaining.  Nevertheless I did pick up this book and read it.  Here are my thoughts: <br /> <br />Many skeptics ask, \\"If the government DOES know something about aliens and UFOs, why, and how, do they keep it secret from everyone else?\\" <br /> <br />Col. Corso's book gives a sober and convincing explanation for this.  Rather than giving a broad overview, however, he wisely sticks to a specific description of his own hands-on experience and how he did the job he was asked to do.  Specifically, as head of the Army's Foreign Technology Desk in the Pentagon, Corso alleges he was in charge of \\"getting something useful\\" out of alien artifacts collected from the Roswell UFO crash in 1947. <br /> <br />Corso was faced with a challenge: How do you gather funding and personnel (many of whom are low-ranking) for a US Army R&D project on the Roswell UFO artifacts, while using \\"normal,\\" visible administrative channels, and keep it a secret from other branches of the government and even many of the individuals directly involved? <br /> <br />In describing how he faced that challenge, Corso gives a thorough account of not only the alien technology he says was discovered at Roswell, but the bureaucratic processes involved in researching it and putting it to use.  He describes how artifacts from Roswell gave earthly science a jumpstart on the integrated circuit chip, the laser, and a host of other technologies, and how these technologies were \\"seeded\\" outside the military to eventually better life for the public.   <br /> <br />If you're looking for a lot of descriptive, speculative narrative about Roswell and aliens in general, you'll find little of it here.  Corso sticks to describing his singular, albeit tremendously important, role in how the government handled the discovery at Roswell, and he does it with a minimum of hocus-pocus.   <br /> <br />Then again that's probably the most valuable thing about this book: it lets the nitty-gritty, sometimes boring details of how the government really functions supercede the sensational.  It gives a solid description of HOW so much could be going on and kept secret within the government. <br /> <br />In writing this book Corso only opens himself up to ridicule, and risks tarnishing his entire career in the military.  I can't see why a sane person would do this just to make a few bucks, and from his writing Corso seems like a very level-headed, objective person.  Judge for yourself, but in my opinion this book seems very truthful and credible.Zeiten in denen ihm nicht einfach nur normaler Gegenwind entgegenschlug.
B0000844I8|4.0|I picked up the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" DVD because you can't go wrong for $5.99 and because I hadn't seen this movie since it was released in the theater in 1994. <br /> <br />Most people know the premise -- an ancient \\"stargate\\" is discovered, the military wants to use it for its own purposes, and an unconventional Egyptologist in the style of Graham Hancock is recruited to decipher the strange heiroglyphs on the stargate so the military can open the door to new worlds on the other side. There are obvious plot holes and the pacing of the film lags in the transition between the second and third acts, but those are minor detractions from an otherwise fun experience.  <br /> <br />Having seen this movie in the theater as a 14-year-old kid the first time around, I didn't have an appreciation for how odd it really is -- Ra is portrayed as a feminine, egotistical maniac who surrounds himself with scantily-clad children like some sort of ancient Michael Jackson. He talks casually of nuking the entire earth (\\"You have harnessed the power of the atom ... I created your civilization, now I will destroy it.\\") while his child-servants give him manicures. All of this is accomplished in an ancient Egyptian dialect spoken by Jaye Davidson in his last role. And it works, not only because of the great acting, stunning costumes and amazing sets, but because it is so bizarre.  <br /> <br />Buried under the action sequences and impressive visuals -- which include a lot of really cool modern interpretations of Egyptian art -- is a plot that shows people believing in an all-powerful deity, only to discover he's not actually a god and he's not all-powerful. The third act of the movie shows us the consequences of that revelation.  <br /> <br />This edition of the DVD also includes an interesting documentary-style look at some of the theories surrounding the Great Pyramid and ancient Egyptian culture, which kind of feels like something that would run on the Discovery Channel on a Sunday afternoon. There's also a commentary track, but be warned -- Roland Emmerich is completely unintelligible no matter how loud you set the volume.
B000ENWKN8|2.0|I like most of Rob & White Zombie's stuff.  Maybe I'm getting older and heading in a different direction than Rob, but this is just NOT impressive.  Where is the punch, drive, or energy?  I can't see the old or recent Zombie fans giving this impressive reviews.  3 decent songs on the disc is not worth the $$.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|The essence of this film is the song \\"calling you\\"....hauntingly done by Jevetta Steele...something in Yasmine calls to Brenda and something in Brenda calls to Yasmine...every character needs something from someone else...someone to whom they would never ordinarily look.

B000002GVO|1.0|This is the worst kind of drivel.  Music for people who hate real music.  This is a paint by numbers approach to making a million dollars without any regard for art.  This music has absolutely no soul.  And now these charlatans are back every year to keep themselves rolling in dough out of the pockets of aging idiots who really think juvenile fluff like Hotel California is \\"deep\\".  You might say this didn't age well but that presumes that it had value in 1976.  It didn't.  it was awful then and is awful now.  And now these clowns have the unmitigated gall to charge suckers $300-$500 a seat to watch them perform this garbage again.  They must have gonads the size of  their egos to do this.  I wouldn't see them if they paid me $500 and offered to do the show in my backyard. If you must buy something with that $14 in your wallet, spend it more wisely on earplugs to shut out this aural pollution that can't seem to be avoided.  It's played in some of the best elevators and dentist offices(where the nitrous oxide can make it only slightly more tolerable).  So you really can't totally avoid it.  But in the name of all things holy, don't contribute another cent to these loser's bank accounts.
B000BTDMDC|5.0|this album effin rocks. its rock but their own, original and fresh version of rock. it has elements of funk and little dashes of Sublime feelings in it while also having elements of Jet and The Strokes and The White Stripes. they're just a mixture of pure goodness and ti'm sure they're going to be one fo the biggest bands ever. The lead singer sounds like Julian Casablancas from The Strokes mixed with the lead singer of Oasis. his voice compliments the band's feeling very well. go buy this album now.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Was f&uuml;r ein grandioser Einstieg zum 20-j&auml;hrigen Bandjubil&auml;um haben sich die Koller Bros. da ausgesucht. Obenstehendes Textfragment stammt vom Opener &bdquo;Take The Night Off\\" und besagter Mittelfinger steckt - auf dem mittlerweile neuntem Full Length der HC Legende - zu 100% bis zum Ellenbogen in all den &Auml;rschen der Metalcore Bubis around the Globe um den Beweis anzutreten, dass Energie und Authentizit&auml;t auch ohne Clean Vocals und Schwedischen Death Approach machbar ist.<br />In der Vergangenheit stand das Quartett f&uuml;r atemberaubende Live Performances, rechtzeitig zum Jubil&auml;um haut man aber einen Hassbrocken auf den Markt, der das Genre Hardcore neu dimensioniert und aufrollt, ohne dabei auch nur im geringsten die schon in der Vergangenheit eingeschlagenen Pfade zu verlassen. F&uuml;nfzehn Hassbatzen in nicht einmal 34 Minuten kann nur eines bedeuten: &bdquo;Hau drauf bis zum Umfallen\\", dies tun die Herren dann auch ohne gro&szlig;artig nach Luft zu schnappen, meist im Midtempo angesiedelt, sound technisch veredelt von Tue Madsen passt hier eigentlich alles von vorne bis hinten, mal darf es sogar ein wenig schneller zur Sache gehen (im gro&szlig;artigen &bdquo;Leader\\"), dann h&ouml;rt man Punk Influences heraus (&bdquo;Die Alone\\" sei hier mal genannt), im Endeffekt relativieren sich Anspieltipps aber dann doch auf Track 1 bis Track 15, das mehrmals hintereinander und bitte nur in ohrenbet&auml;ubender Lautst&auml;rke.<br />S.O.I.A. sind f&uuml;r diese Szene, in der heute schon jeder Hunz und Kunz Metal mit Hardcore vermischt, so was von enorm wichtig und essentiell, wobei irgendwie hab ich nach wie vor das Gef&uuml;hl, die Herren scheren sich einen Dinef um all das, sondern ziehen konsequent ihr eigenes Ding durch, nur so &uuml;berzeugend wie mit &bdquo;Death to Tyrants\\" hat das halt noch nie geklungen, Vorzeigealbum, Messlatte, Meilenstein, erfrischend, glaubw&uuml;rdig nennt es wie ihr wollt, das hier ist das mit Abstand beste was aus dem Hardcore Sektor in den letzten Jahren auf Tonkonserve verewigt wurde und hat absolut das Zeug sich zu einem Szeneklassiker zu entwickeln.
1400079276|3.0|Much better than Murakami's South of the Border, West of the Sun (in my opinion). <br /> <br />It's difficult to say how I feel about this book. At times I was enthralled and plot twists literally made me gasp or laugh out loud. But at times I found myself saying \\"gimme a break.\\" I think this is because the novel is extremely surreal, in a way that broke down at times. I like this novel because it is different from any other book I've read recently in many ways. But it only gets three stars because it could have been a lot better, in terms of character development, plot manueverings, and minimizing the awkwardness associated with on again off again sentimentality/surrealness.  <br /> <br />Overall, I'd recommend at least giving it a try.
B000059T00|5.0|This albulm is, in my opinion the best album ever produced. Everyone should have this album, I don't care what kind of music you like. There are only six songs on the album, but the instrumentation, vocals and lyrics are all perfect. Each song has great lyrics, guitar riffs, etc. I believe that Ginger Baker, Eric Clapton and Stevie Woodwind are the greatest trio of artists ever to grace the stage at the same time. If you think that Eric Clapton was great as a solo arist, listen to this album and then think again. Most people know who Eric Clapton is but many don't know of Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominos, or even Cream. Also many have not heard the incredible percussion of Ginger Baker or the overall musical talent of Stevie Woodwind. EVERYONE needs to buy this album, and I also highly recommend \\"Fresh Cream\\" and \\"Disreali Gears\\" by Cream. <br /> <br />From the opening riff of \\"Had to Cry Today,\\" the soothing \\"Can't Find My Way Home,\\" the upbeat \\"Well... All Right,\\" The classic \\"Presence of the Lord,\\" Magical \\"Sea of Joy,\\" to the final chanting of \\"Do What You Like,\\" this album absolutely rocks! Every song has the potential to become your favorite. I guarentee you will not be disapointed with this album.
0141439513|5.0|One of the only reason why I have read this book is because I had to pick a British Author to read about and then write a paper on.  At first I didn't pick Jane Austin, I was unaware that she was British, then when my teacher passed out a list of authors I saw her name and automatically thought 'Pride and Prejudice' and I wanted to research Jane Austen.  I first saw the movie when I was younger and I didn't understand it.  Ever since then I have had an interest in it.  When the newer movie came out with Keira Knightly came out, I wanted to go see it but ended up not going.  I took this oppertunity to read the book.  As I began to read this book, I had trouble understanding it.  I am not good at the old English and by the end of the book, I still didn't fully understand it but I managed to get the full story.  I did use Cliff Notes to help me understand each chapter because it didn't always make sense to me but after I read the summeries of each chapter I was able to understand the story.<br /><br />I found the story very romantic.  I thought it unusual how Mr. Darcy acts in the beginning, by ignoring Elizabeth and saying  rude comments about her then when she stays at the house for a couple of days because her sister is sick, he starts to like her.  It is charming to read about a guy who like this girl so much that he'll do anything to get her.  In my opinion that is one sign of true love.  Elizabeth isn't too fond of Mr. Darcy because of what he said about her, but he goes on in the book to prove his love for her and in the end win her over.  Mr. Darcy has to go throuhg Elizabeth liking Wickham, Mr. Collins proposing to her, being turned down by Elizabeth with his first marriage proposal, and the critism from other older women about not marrying Elizabeth.  The book shows how much one guy can love a girl and make everything happen.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This is one of the most unusual films I've ever seen. Combining Kafka, David Lynch, and Tarantino, the film pits a sociopathic sadist against an innocent man as it explores what happens when one becomes a victim of one's own wrath and hunger for revenge. Because so much of the film relies on plot surprises, I will only say that a man tries to avenge his enemy and in the process he encounters his own inner demons.<br /><br />Perhaps more than any film I've seen, this movie is relentless in its intensity, both inwardly and outwardly. It is one of the most painful films I have ever witnessed but the suffering is not forced or gratituous. It is the result of a deeply thought theme--the tragedy of not knowing the difference between defending one's honor and exacting revenge.<br /><br />Fans of Mulholland Dr., The Walkabout, A Clockwork Orange, and Kill Bill should enjoy this film.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|It wasn't my idea. It was on Encore one morning, and then again and again, and over the next few months my kids and I got hooked, so I bought the DVD. Yeah, it's a mess of kitsch, and the dialogue is standard drivel---but somehow the effect of the whole is fun, probably because everyone in the cast looks like they had a blast making it.

B0000085N4|3.0|In the late '80s, the Cult appeared poised to conquer the world.  With producer Rick Rubin, they stripped bare their sound of excess production and recorded a raw, blues-based rock record (in \\"Electric\\").  For its followup, the band kept the hard rock, but eschewed Rubin's minimalist approach in favor of over-the-top arrangements.  The resulting album-- \\"Sonic Temple\\"-- is significantly different from its predecessor, but like \\"Electric\\", it has a deciding lack of consistency, when it's good, it's great, but unfortunately, it misses as much as it hits. <br /> <br />And certainly looking at the first two tracks, it's not hard to see both sides of this.  Both \\"Sun King\\" and \\"Fire Woman\\" feature mellower introductions recalling the gothic-tinged psychedelia of \\"Love\\", but both quickly move into extended riff-based rock performances.  The critical difference between the two appears to be singer Ian Astbury-- on the former, he sounds almost lazy and minimally uninspired, with a lack of energy and conviction behind the vocal, on the latter, he's downright vicious-- aggressive, powerful and assertive, full of swagger and attitude.  And the difference makes \\"Sun King\\" pretty forgettable and \\"Fire Woman\\" extraordinary. <br /> <br />\\"Sonic Temple\\" does hit now and again-- single \\"Edie (Ciao Baby)\\" hearkens back to the band's old days-- clean tone, processed guitars, a passionate solo and a superb vocal delivery from Astbury.  \\"New York City\\" is something totally bizarre-- blues based rock meets punk meets an almost stride feel, and while Astbury seems a bit unengaged with the bombastic \\"Sweet Soul Sister\\", it's such a fine slice of hard rock that even his somewhat flakiness on the performance can't take it down a notch.  But for each of these, there's something soaked in too many overdubs (\\"American Horse\\"), a bit too light songwriting (\\"Automatic Blues\\") or in desperate need of editing (the over seven minutes \\"Soul Asylum\\"-- there's a fantastic four minute song in there...).<br /> <br />It is inconsistent, but like \\"Electric\\", \\"Sonic Temple\\" has enough great material on it that it's a worthwhile purchase.
B000002GZ1|5.0|This music lives on.  It is as impressive today as it was in 1965.  This is a must-have album for any blues fan, along with this band's next and even more astonishing and undeniably seminal blues-rock-jazz fusion album, East-West.<br /><br />I was a freshman at Berkeley in 65.  Around January 66, Butterfield and his band and the newly formed Jefferson Airplane were the entertainment for a student dance on campus.  WHAT A DANCE!  I had a relatively hot date that night who had most of my attention, but I couldn't help but perk up my ears and comment, \\"Hey, these guys are good!\\"  Subsequently I saw Butterfield at Fillmore Auditorium and then various configurations of the band, Mike Bloomfield's various efforts (e.g., Electric Flag) and Elvin Bishop's bands many times.  All provided me with many fond memories and other stories I could recount of this most glorious time in American popular music.<br /><br />Anyway, I won't go into a lot of analysis of this album.  It's just too precious to analyze.  I'll just say the mix, faithful to the original vinyl, is very bright.  Some may want to cut the treble a bit.  As the original liner notes recommended - TURN IT UP and enjoy.  Listen to it over and over, like I did, each time focusing on a different member of the band and their masterful playing.  I wore out the first vinyl album and was smart enough to buy a couple of extra copies.
B000AJJNOK|3.0|I could sit here and moan about how terrible this rap is, but instead I'm going to refer you to another review on this item by B. Flores. I like this fellow, despite having never met him. Like him, I am a fan of punk music and I appreciate the way punk lyricists express themselves by producing often very hardcore and challenging music which often describes an issue close to their hearts, be it political, personal or intellectual. it's a common misconception that punk music is mindless and thuggish. In fact, the truth could not be further away, and a good example of this is the well known political bitterness with which Jake Burns of Stiff Little Fingers approaches his songwriting, most notable for their hits 'Suspect Device' and 'Alternative Ulster'. <br />You can see from B. Flores' review that, in the true punk spirit, he has no fear of uniquity, and is entirely at home standing out from the sheep of society. He is also willing to express his opinions, despite some people perhaps finding them offensive, because he believes in what he is saying wholeheartedly. <br />In the early days of punk music, when it first swept the UK, it was performed and led by working-class socialists and anarchists forming low-profile local bands. Few of the true punks became well known in popular spheres, because they refused to sign deals with record companies (when the idea of signing punk bands became acceptable), on the basis that this would dilute their ideals and separate them from their culture, the many punks who supported them.  <br />Now then, the issue of 50 and his kru. <br />Firstly I'd like to define rap. You may notice that I have not used the popular term 'rap music' because this seems to be inaccurate. It implies that the artist has produced at least two of the three basic properties of music: rhythm, melody and harmony; but in rap the monotony of the rapper's voice does not produce any appreciable melodic sound, and therefore this stream of lyrics must be described inthe bounds of poetry- i.e. rap is a genre of crude poetry.  <br />To draw a comparison with my preferred genres, rap does appear to have something to say. It appears to be an expression of feelings of mysoginism and hatred, often in racial, social or personal terms, and general inexperience about life and the many facets of it that make it worthwhile. I find it peculiar, however, that the notions that one is better than everyone else/ the continual berating of unfortunate women who, perhaps through lack of desire for it, have no respect at all, and are flatly refused to be understood (and I realise that I may be starting to sound feminist at this point. I hate feminists actually, but through my experience with love and platonic feelings I can understand the humanity of women in general). Personally I find that the repetitiveness of these simply expressed notions lends a monotony to rap such that, due to lack of sophistication of 'music' and use of indirect expression (i.e. metaphor, symbolism, analogy and other such figurative and poetic ideas that make songwriting an enjoyable craft), the number of different rap tracks becomes finite. Therefore, originality is already a near impossibility, and clearly has not been acheived by the now-popular manufactured artists. <br />As a closing point I would just like to say that for those readers who were wondering, I am in fact a fan of Rage Against the Machine to some extent. As you may have gleaned I am often attracted to vivid expression of emotion which normal rap lacks, but Rage acheive with their simplistic riff loops and aggresive vocals. <br />In short, you could read an essay shorter than this one to gain a full an complete understanding of the rap genre. exposing yourself to the painfully dull voices of 'the machine's' creations is not at all necessary, and I don't think you need to spend money on feeding this beast. <br /> <br />Also, thank you B. Flores for your inspiring, if inarticulate, sense of freedom.
B000002MT0|3.0|(2 1/2 stars)<br /><br />\\"Come\\" is the first Prince album from the period when he was openly fueding with his then-label Warner Brothers, and his resentment is apparent on this record. The tone of the album is dark and cold; the tracks are full of tight, polished grooves, but there's not a hint of Prince's usual playfullness or joyousness in sight. The title track, \\"Come\\", starts off sounding promising, but quickly becomes repetitive, and it's almost unforgivably long. \\"Papa\\" and \\"Race\\" explore the socially-conscious topics of child abuse and race relations, but come across as preachy more than they do as passionate. Neither track are anywhere as riveting as \\"Sign o' the Times\\". Of all the tracks, only the techno-dance \\"Loose\\", the space-y \\"Space\\" and the soulful \\"Letitgo\\" stand out ... and even these tracks pale in comparison to Prince's most brilliant work.<br /><br />All that being said, it's not that this is a bad album really, it's just that Prince is such a genius that his fans expect more from him. But I guess at the end of the day, Prince's music is sort of like pizza ... even when it's bad, it's pretty good.r und anderer beruflicher Stationen in der IT-Anwendung und Produktion.<br />Es ist ein Buch umfangreich gesammelten und ausgewerteten Erfahrungswissens im Umfeld des RZ-Betriebes - von der IT-Produktion &amp; RZ-Praxis und für die RZ-Praxis und den RZ-Praktiker mit entsprechendem betriebswirtschaftlichen und praktischem Hintergrund und Bewertung.

Damit vermittelt der Verfasser dem Leser praxisrelevant eine wirkungsvoll angewandte Verknüpfung der aktuellen Schlüsselwissensgebiete Betriebswirtschaft (Controlling) mit angewandter IT (am Beispiel von RZ).<br />Im deutschsprachigen Raum gibt es hier wenig derart aus der Praxis entstandene Literatur, die eine derart anwendungsnahe Brücke zu schlagen vermag :-).<br />Hierbei kann das JoMi-Bändchen &bdquo;IT-Finanzmanagement - Betriebswirtschaft für die Datenverarbeitung\\" als &bdquo;Grundlagenwerk\\" der vierbändigen JoMi-Fachbuchreihe vom gleichen Verfasser bzw.

Teil 4 behandelt die Begriffe des IT-Ressourcenmanagements (IT-Finanzmanagements) mit den Leistungseinheiten, -arten, Kostenstellen- und Kostenarten-Philosophie, dem Versuch einer Typisierung der Kostenarten in der IT (-Produktion), Kriterien (Checkliste) zur Auswahl eines Accounting-Systems, MIPS-Werten und ihrer relativen Leistung, Service Units, Rechnerzeit und MIPS-Werte, Plattenkapazitäten und Metrik, Personalstundensatz-Ermittlung und den Disziplinen des IT-Ressourcenmanagements.<br>In Teil 5 kommt der Verfasser zu einer umfassenden Darstellung der Methoden, dem Vorgehen und Arbeitshilfen zum IT-Ressourcenmanagement (IT-Leistungsabrechnung; von den Kosten zur Preisbildung; Exkurs zu IBM's SLR für Systemmanagement der Ressourcen). Teil 6 behandelt die IT-Kostenrechnung und Kalkulation (Kostenplatz-Rechnung, Leistungseinheiten und Abrechnungskriterien, Zuordnung zu den Kostenträgern, Kalkulation im Rechenzentrum) und Teil 7 beschließt das Werk mit dem BAB (Betriebsabrechnungsbogen) des Rechenzentrums (RZ) - wohingegen die ausführliche Behandlung des BAB's des RZ selbst einem eigenständigen JoMi-Bändchen &bdquo;IT-Betriebsabrechnung - Der BAB des Rechenzentrums\\" vorbehalten bleibt.<br />Vom gleichen Verfasser sind auch die Fachbücher &bdquo;Pricing für SAP-Dienste - Verfahren, Methoden und Arbeitshilfen zur Kostenrechnung und Preisbildung für die SAP-Infrastruktur\\" und &bdquo;IT-Benchmarking - Fibel in 3 Stufen (Level 2) - Grundsätze, Praktiken, Definitionen, Tabellen, Beispiele, Leistungswerte, IT-Benchmarks\\" erschienen.<br>Weiterhin ist der Verfasser Herausgeber von &bdquo;Jens Siebertz: IT-Kostencontrolling - Nutzenpotentiale von Controlling-Tools\\".<br />Alle vorgenannten JoMi-Bändchen sind aus der langjährigen(firmenübergreifenden) Arbeitskreis-Tätigkeit in der IT-Wirtschaft (IT-Produktion) in D, A und CH entstanden bzw. spiegeln die dort gesammelten und verwerteten Erfahrungen wider - was man teilweise noch an ihrer Aufbereitung und Darstellung (der Tabellen und Listings I-):-s) erkennen kann (&amp;#61516;).

B00005JOFQ|2.0|This movie is like \\"titanic\\".  Tons of hype with nothing to back it up.  Well written script I must admit.  Great scenes of the countryside I cannot deny.  Overall it just didn't live up to the hype.  Not since Titanic was something thrown about the world in the biggest Dog and Pony show since Titanic.  And, like titanic, it's just a story, and it isn't all that.  Hathaway is horrible as an actress.  Ledger and Gylenhall are great actors who could have picked something better to play with.  Overall sorry, it was okay, but not the all american, all world, all encompassing film of the 21st century like it was billed as.  What to expect from hollywood though?  They make one final push with the \\"pro\\" alternative lifestyle approach and still botch it up.  What I mean is, they tried going in the opposite direction to balance the scales after they tipped over from the \\"we're always happy nothing wrong here\\" scenario that came from shows like Will and Grace and got shoved out into the mainstream by the likes of Ellen Degeneres and Rosie O'donnell.r transported you to a souk or synagogue, maybe put you on a bike through Paris or took you through the streets of London with incredibly good buskers doing string quartets and polkas on different corners. Then imagine all of the above shaken into a very tasteful cocktail with a unique flavour of its own. Poison Sweet Madeira is an absolutely delicious surprise, from the \\"world\\" (if you must) / symphonically rocking and reeling opening track, via various charms and tunes, to the terrific, Penguin (Café Orchestra)-flavoured finale.     Also, please eliminate from the start any qualms about this being the latest \\"lovely young thing does the classical bit.\\" It started, I suppose, with Vanessa-Mae and has continued with some distressing recent examples; but, honestly, this lady's writing and playing is way, way beyond such ephemera, so pardon the same breath, and all that. The artiste herself, certainly, looks very fetching on the cover. It's your ears, however, that are in for an authentic, accomplished musical experience. This woman can really play; plus she writes tunes your brain and heart want to hear. Shes not afraid of austerity and has a way of playing that should help make some of the less immediate material here  yes, klezmer included  more popular. For us, the best example is the Light That Never Dies, an utterly classy track that has Ralph Fiennes reciting an imagist poem against music that would be a perfect soundtrack to the result of the animators of Belleville Rendezvous having a go at a Third Man remake or something in that vein.    Above all, what you get here is that rare treat of audible talent: fine, accurate technique, virtuoso, passionate playing and music that comes from deep cultural roots and achieves an effect that's at once old and familiar, fresh and intriguing. Fire up the samovar, get the vodka from the freezer, slice some spicy sausage, unwrap some chocolate and get down to this great, great album!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I don't think I could add anything to the well-deserved praise this film has already received.  Let me just say that Brokeback Mountain is the best film I've ever seen, and I don't expect to ever see one that will surpass it in my estimation, admiration or esteem.  This movie was a transcendent experience for me, and I will never be the same.  It should have won the Oscar, Heath Ledger should have won the Oscar, Jake Gyllenhaal should have won the Oscar, Michelle Williams should have won the Oscar.  Posterity will never forgive the Academy, and neither will I.
B000002OMN|5.0|Love this CD .... had it for years a true classic that transends all ages and classes - for those trying to get deep and philosophical trying to find meaning and pitifully still not getting an answer ..... I would not admit to being that stupid but there you go...as one of the reviewers obviously did not. <br /> <br />Great CD powerful music and songs as always Meatloaf & Steinman a dynamic team - thank goodness most people get that - pity those who do not!!!!!
1401301363|5.0|Nigella gives wonderful introductions to every receipe. and wonderful interesting facts and info to every section. As well as the most important fact in any cookbook PHOTOS of receipes! Her receipes are generally simple and the rare ones that aren't she tells you and why, but makes you believe you can still do it which actually I can!  <br />I am very fussy with which cookbooks I own - I receive a lot and give away a lot but when I am up against it I only want to turn to 2 or 3 tried and trusted cookbooks. And this is certainly one of them.
B000E33VWW|5.0|The epigraph to this film appears at the end, words appended to Truman Capote's last unfinished work: \\"More tears are shed for answered prayers than for unanswered ones.\\" In his quest for the story that became the book \\"In Cold Blood,\\" one of Capote's most cherished prayers was answered. This film explores the way that quest and its ending essentially destroyed him. It is a powerful work.    \\"Capote\\" explores the corrupting power of a story, a story of two men whose humanity was lost for a few dollars when they brutally murdered a family in Kansas during a robbery gone bad. How curious we all feel to understand the why and how of such an event! Before Capote's novelistic portrayal of this crime, however, there was a kind of taboo against mixing fact and fiction, against allowing one's personal desires to inform how a story like this would be told. \\"In Cold Blood\\" shattered that taboo. I'm old enough still to remember how new and strange and shocking the book was.    The film is not about the book, but about the making of it. It steadily and meticulously (if not always accurately) dramatizes the longings and compromises that seduced Capote as he befriended Perry Smith, one of the murderers. It unfolds his complicated but fiinally dishonest relationship with this man, whom he saw as a kind of fellow outcast.     We do not end up admiring the protagonist, but just as he is implicated in the crime he begs to hear more about, so we -- the audience -- are also implicated; we come to need to hear that story too, which Smith delivers finally in a wrenching scene that is the turning point of this film. Like Capote, we also need to witness to the deaths of the killers. And we too are made willingly complicit in whatever distortions the film-makers also introduced when they put together their own \\"true story\\" of Capote's journey. The film has many levels, as we too then must confront the complexity of our human guilt as witnesses and storytellers ourselves, which I take to bethe point of the movie.    Philip Seymour Hoffman won best actor for this picture; he deserved the award. He is amazing. The emotions he shows and those he represses bring the ambiguous and not entirely unsympathetic Capote to life. His final meeting with Smith (played skillfully but without brilliance by Clifton Collins) is one of the most moving scenes I've ever seen in the cinema. Catherine Keener as Harper Lee and Chris Cooper as the DA who caught the killers are also very good; Cooper especially was well cast and brings his characteristic gut-busting, understated tension to the part.
1400079179|1.0|Dan Brown has made a reported US$250,000,000 from this book so far. Good for him! As a would be writer of fiction I love to see that kind of success. With the recent trial and the soon to be released movie, he'll make even more. More good for him!<br /><br />But am I the only one who thinks the plot of this book is trite and not especially interesting, let alone believable. It is poorly written, badly paced, and frankly boring.<br /><br />But then Dan Brown has made all that money, so there you go.
0743454537|5.0|I'd heard a lot about this writer and had to find out for myself just how good she is. So I got hold of a copy of this novel and guess what? I'm a fan! I'm currently tracking down all of the author's back catalogue now too. This novel treads that fine line between the me-me-me league and human goodness. It's often a wavy line and sometimes people never really do learn their real value. I love the scope of this novel. I love the way the author shows the characters wrestling with their demons. It's a complete trip and leaves you breathless, but begging for more. <br />A novel which explores the sibling relationship pushed to its outer limit. Any more and I'll give the game away! Highly recommended.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I really enjoyed the theatrical cut, and now, get ready for all the nice storylines that were deleted.  What you'll see on the director's cut (referenced from AICN) SPOILERS AHEAD!!:    - did you realize that the priest at the beginning is actually the half-brother of Balian (Orlando Bloom)? Their relationship is much more complicated and unpleasant in this version, and we learn that Balian is in jail following his wife's death, thanks to his brother's claim that he is possessed by the devil.    - We also learn that Balian was an engineer before he became a blacksmith, that he built war machines when he was part of an army, and he's released from prison because the local lord needs Balian's help. So much more work is put into the establishment of Balian's character that by the time we actually meet him in the film now, we have a sense of who he is.    - The lord that Balian works for? Turns out, he's Neeson's brother, and when Godfrey shows up in the village, he's coming home. There's an entire scene that takes place at the castle where it's clear that his absence made it possible for his brother to take over, something that his brother doesn't want to see change. Since Godfrey has no heir, if he dies, then his new lands also become the property of the brother, something that makes more sense of the battle scenes involving Neeson and his group of soldiers.     - When Neeson goes to talk to Balian the first time, he stops at the door to the smith's shop, looking out at a particular spot. He flashes back to when he was younger, to when he was with Balian's mother, and that one moment says all we need to know about the particular paradise that Godfrey seeks and that he knows he'll never find again. It explains so much about why he would want to come and make amends and reach out to Balian. He's looking for absolution, and he figures he can find it this way, and the film shows us instead of just telling us.    - Baldwin IV is shown refusing the last sacrament from Patriarch Heraclius.     - Another major change is the re-insertion of the character of Baldwin V (who was shown in some of the trailers), here depicted as the son of Sibylla by Guy. He is portrayed as suffering from leprosy, like his uncle. His death is depicted as an act of euthanasia by his mother, using poison.     - Balian also fights a climactic duel with Guy.     - Additionally, Eva Green's role as the Queen has been expanded, and she's not there just for Orland Bloom's sexual interest.    - More insight into absolution, forgiveness, and politics in this time period.
B000BTJDG2|3.0|TEOER is an interesting twist on the typical possessive horror movie.  This particular movie is a cross between a courtroom drama and a horror.  But don't be fooled by the odd crossovers, as the courtroom drama aspect and horror elements actually work well together.  With the exorcisms seen through flashbacks while the main action is situated in the courtroom.  However, this way of film making does not destroy the horror of the movie.  The two work together well to produce a well written horror/drama with solid acting from lawyer Laura Linney and the possessed Emily Rose.<br /><br />This is a good, itelligent movie that is worth a try.  Although the The Exorcist is still the king of Exorcism.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Those are the last three words spoken in Brokeback Mountain, the tear-jerker directed by Ang Lee and starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhaal. (Don't worry; I am not going to say any more about the ending.) Ever since I've heard those last three words - and I've heard them twice - it has been hard to extract them, and all that leads up to them, out of my head.  <br /> <br />Brokeback Mountain may look, on first blush, to be a 'gay cowboy' film. Believe me when I - and other reviewers - tell you that it is infinitely more than that. It is a story of two people (yes, of the same sex) who are hopelessly in love....in secret. Jack Twist is the sensitive and optimistic one. Ennis Del Mar is the quintessential cowboy - the silent and guarded one. When thse two meet in '63 on Brokeback Mountain, they do not realize how each will change and help shape the other for the better part of the next 20 years.  <br /> <br />If you are only familiar with Heath Ledger as the Aussie sex symbol of Cassanova and A Knight's Tale, then you have only seen part of him. His evocation of Ennis Del Mar are spectacular. While it is too early in this young actors career to go too far out on a limb, I predict that when all is said and done, this may be the role he is known for! It is obivous that he knows this character well. This is not to discount Jake Gyllenhaal's perfect-fit performance as Jack Twist. It is just to say that Jack lacks the delicate nuances of Ennis.  <br /> <br />The cinematography is fantastic! If you are reading this review, then you have probably missed your chance to see this on the big screen and that is a shame. Whatever you do, see this on a nice, big, widescreen tv. The shots of the Wyoming (actually, Canadian) landscape are awesome, and match the film's emotional beauty with physical beauty.  <br /> <br />As said, this film is about a 20 year love affair that tests its characters to their limits. Two characters are forced to come to grips with their homosexuality (bisexuality?) in a time, place, and occupation that does not allow such a thing. They must keeep the identity of their one true love a secret from their female lovers, who can't help but pale in comparison. It is love story that is (unlike every other love story) not at all cliche as it adds this extra dimension.  <br /> <br />Yes, the film is a character film and as such, it moves slow. It is approximately 2 1/2 hours but - at least to my eyes - this is time well spent. Every minute of this film is there for a reason; to give you as true and unadulterated a glimpse into these two characters as is possible. The dialogue is sparse (as most dialogue between cowboys - private people - is). Alas, it is all worth it.  <br /> <br />\\"Jack, I swear...\\" Everything culminates into these three lines. Did tears run down my face? You bet; both times. Will tears run down yours? I don't know, but don't you think it is worth finding out? <br />
B00000JR29|3.0|This has always been and probably will always be one of my favourite all-time albums.  Tracks like \\"Everybody Wants To Rule the World\\" and \\"Head Over Heels\\" will also be among my all-time favourite songs. However, overall, this album still falls short when compared with their brilliant debut \\"The Hurting\\".  TFF goes blatantly commercial here and succeeds overwhelmingly with this album becoming their best-selling ever.  This version, though remastered does not sound as good a job as with what they did on \\"The Hurting\\" as well.  The sound is still pretty muddy here and I hope they do a better remastering job soon with just the original 8 tracks and in an mlps format.  The additional 7 bonus tracks here are quite horrible and perhaps with the exception of the last two tracks are just so obviously fillers with no artistic or creative merit whatsoever.  As Economics 101 teaches us, more is better than less, however that's not the case here as the bonus tracks are so bad that they actually take away from the overall enjoyment of the album.  My advice would be to wait for a better remastered album without these bonus tracks to be released.
074322454X|5.0|Our nation owes alot to these men and women.  How can life ever be looked at the same again.
B0000062Y2|1.0|I am not sure which is worse:  the atricious sound quality of this version of the soundtrack or Ted Neely.  Let me just say that I am a huge fan of JCS.  Huge.  If you truly enjoy the music, I'd strongly recommend purchasing the 1996 remastered version of the 1970 original album. <br /> <br />This version of the soundtrack sounds very flat.  I agree with the reviewer who said they got better sound quality off of their old LP. <br /> <br />Ted Neely replaces (or tries to replace) a wholly superior Ian Gillan as Jesus.  Neely screeches and over-emotes on virtually ever song.  Gillan (the lead singer of Deep Purple) is a hard act to follow, and Neely just doesn't cut it.

0307277674|1.0|This book is very confusing and not base on the bible, I think it is just some people who don;t really understand the Bible and have nothing to do so they just write books.
B0000636UN|2.0|I love Sheryl Crow, really I do. However, I feel like this is the weakest album of her catalog so far.  Not to say it's a bad album, but it runs out of steam quickly.  The first five tracks are easily five of the six best (she does save a gem for us at the end with Weather Channel).  Here is more of a fun album instead of a labor of love.  Sheryl brings her famous friends to guest, such as Lenny Kravitz, Don Henley and Stevie Nicks.  However, Sheryl seems to do her best work on her own, just listen to the self-titled album and The Globe Sessions. <br /> <br />From a sales standpoint, this album thrusted Sheryl back onto the A-list after middling sales for Globe Sessions, but if you listen to the two albums, you'll notice that this album doesn't have half the heart the predecessor does.   Luckily, she has redeemed herself with Wildflower in my book, although some might consider that album too mellow. <br /> <br />Sheryl has some great tracks here, and a few that are the most commercial she's ever done, but if you just want one Sheryl CD that isn't a compilation, this is the last one I'd recommend, it's way too mediocre for her talents.
0340328150|5.0|Ich erinnere mich gerne an Kanada 1996, als ich diese Maxi-CD das erste Mal in den Händen hielt und anhörte. Bald darauf hieß es, sie sei nicht mehr erhältlich - ein Umstand, den ich schon einmal betrauerte.<br />Aber: Die Plattenfirmen waren gnädig, und so ist &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; wieder erhältlich - und das ist nur gut so. Denn vor allem &quot;Chimes of freedom&quot; und die Acoustic version von &quot;Born to run&quot; gehören zum besten, was jemals an Springsteen-Live-Produkten veröffentlicht worden ist. &quot;Chimes of freedom&quot;, legendär bereits durch Bob Dylan und The Byrds, zeichnet sich durch eine ungeheuer kraftvolle, ins Blut gehende Interpretation aus und zeigt einmal mehr, warum einst Jon Landau im &quot;Boss&quot; die Zukunft des Rock'n'Roll erkannte. &quot;Born to run&quot; ist in dieser langsamen, nahezu melancholischen Version mindestens so kraftvoll, wenn nicht sogar noch intensiver als das &quot;plugged&quot; Original - ein Abgesang auf frühere Zeiten?<br />Wer das Glück hatte, den Boss 1989 live zu hören, weiß diese CD wirklich zu schätzen. Wer das Glück nicht hatte, wird sie genauso lieben.
B000C3H4MC|5.0|Stop whingeing the lot of you! These remasters are brilliant. The Digipacks are a much classier presentation than jewel cases. Maybe like me you'll want to put them in plastic sleeves to keep them pristine, but unless you treat all your possesions like dirt then they will last your lifetime. If the Dualdiscs aren't working in your gear then it's time to upgrade. The stereo remasters are as they should be, sounding full and rich and clear. The 5.1 surround sound remixes are the best of their kind I have come across as they maintain the colour and texture (yes 'feel' if you like) of the original stereo mix. 'Remain in Light' is such a dense tapestry of sound and only now in 5.1 surround can it be done justice.  Sometimes in surround mixes you can pick out individual sounds to the detriment of the overall blend and the ear feels let down by discovering the secret ingredients, but in the Talking Heads remixes some of those sounds are even more interesting in isolation but still entwine with everything else to preserve the intention of the stereo mix. What a majestic, menacing,  lush and swirling delight 'The Overload' has become in 5.1 How lucky we are to live in these times when technology allows us to listen to great music that's nearly 30 years old and have it sound better than it ever has! And aren't we lucky to be fans of a band called Talking Heads.
B00002NDLU|4.0|Travis are one of my favourite bands simply because of their simplicity. There isnt really nothing that original or spectacular about the music or lyrics of Travis' songs, but they are all great sing alongs with good melodys that are easy to chill out to. <br />I have given this album 4 stars purely because I am not a fan of ALL of the whole tracklisting. However, there are some classics such as Sing, Turn and my personal favourite, Driftwood. <br />All in all, a great collection of Travis' hits thats well worth the purchase. If your after a chill out CD, then this ones for you., Weller and Carrere, the cast `Top of the World' include Joe Pantliano, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Peter Coyote, but none of them are required to show what they really can do. It is not a little shocking to see Sydney J. Furie directing this nonsense, and remember his works in the past like \\"The Ipcress File.\\" But that was in 1965. <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|The first time I heard U2 was when \\"New Year's Day\\" was on MTV constantly.  I never liked it.  Then by the time JOSHUA TREE came out, I thought the band was \\"ok\\" but I never really got into them that much.  After hearing HTDAAB, I have to say I am still not a fan.  It all sounds the same to me.  Maybe if they would get some new material, they would be better.  Then again, maybe they wouldn't.
B000BONWUU|5.0|\\"Seven\\" stars Morgan Freeman as a gentle cop whose only a week away from retirement. Brad Pitt plays the brash young detective that has come to replace him. In their week together, they work on finding a serial killer whose victims are all tortured (gruesomely) and killed to illustrate the \\"seven deadly sins.\\"<br /><br />Freeman is wonderful, as always, playing a soft-spoken, patient, and wise character. Pitt looks at ease playing the cocky, over-eager kid cop. Gwyneth Paltrow has a small part as Pitt's wife who encounters the serial killer later in the film. The killer is played by Kevin Spacey as a quiet, brilliant, insane madman.<br /><br />The direction and photography are top-notch. The pace is quick, there are no wasted speeches or scenes. Because we know there will be seven murders, we are expecting, but never quite prepared for, the horrific crime scenes.  The ending took me by surprise, which is always good. I recommend Seven for viewers who want blood, gore, and excellent acting.
1572244267|5.0|The Coen Brothers are fond of doing genre movies, and Miller's Crossing is their beautifully executed and damn-near perfect gangster film.  It plays on the plot and character conventions expertly, always keeping you engaged whilst at the same time keeping you guessing, and features some truly excellent performances - particularly from Gabriel Byrne in the lead.  If you liked The Godfather, you won't want to miss this.
B00004W3L3|4.0|Just got finished listening to this for the third time in as many days. And, as I expected, this release takes at least that to start \\"getting\\" it. This is definately progressive music of the highest caliber and requires the listener to spend ample time with it to fully appreciate it...and I'm starting to really appreciate this album. Now, does this sound like retro-prog (especially Genesis) as other reveiwers have stated?...Yes, Very much so. As a matter of fact, the first time I played this, I thought I had stumbled across some kind of unreleased 3rd disc from Genesis' Lamb Lies Down on Broadway---Yes, Fish sounds strikingly like Peter Gabriel, and many of the musical passages recall Vintage Genesis. Anyway, enough of my opinion and comparisons...my real intentions with this review is to rate an album that I've heard alot about, but have just started listening to...we all know how easy it is to review and rate an album thats \\"near and dear\\" to us. Unfortunately, I haven't heard this enough times to comment on individual songs, so I'll just say that there is plenty of cool(if not strange) music here that is played  with lots of passion---which merits an automatic 4 stars from me in most cases. So, I must reserve 5 stars until I can fully \\"digest\\" this release, in which time I will write a revised review (until then, I MUST give MY personal favorites the 5 star accolades...'Physical Graffiti','Abbey Road','Seconds Out',etc,etc,etc...  Bottom line, I like this so far and if your looking for some music that's a little \\"different\\", I'm guessing you'll like it to! ENJOY, Jeff <br />P.S. On the recommedation of other Amazon reviewers, I just ordered 'Clutching at Straws' and 'Afraid of Sunlight', which I'm looking forward to hearing...If you like 'Misplaced Childhood'...these may be worth checking into as well.  <br /> <br />
B00006878K|5.0|Let me tell you something: if you want to listen to a guy tearing his soul apart through his voice and guitar, this is the real deal. This is blues at its purest essence. It's a shame that the 3 minutes limit so popular those years led to cutting some extra jamming that I bet was going to be total genius. Too bad that this remastered album couldn't include extended versions of all those songs, because you feel they were going to a climax on a song, and suddenly the music fades out... So, the original tapes were criminally butchered this way and there's no way of getting all those pieces back, right? Well, it looks like almost forty years later there's nothing to do about it... Those spontaneous improvisations from these natural musicians are lost forever. ARGH!!! :-(  It really hurts badly! <br /> <br />Anyway, no need to have those extended solos to appreciate the talent of these guys on its entirety. Albert King's phrases were all statements from the very deepest of his heart, both vocally and on his guitar leads; and all this is perfectly noticeable on this album in spite of it all. The King is as convincing as when singing minor blues in \\"I almost lost my mind\\", as when soloing soaring lines all along \\"Personal Manager\\". All the emotion you can get is delivered with passion and power, and at the very end that's all that matters with the blues -- I guess. <br /> <br />So, if you ever wondered why this man influenced generations of monster axemen, including Steve Ray Vaugham, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and many many others, this album could be a good start. You'll see how amazing his guitar tone was, and how strongly he played with silences and tempo to create great lines from the simplest blues building blocks. A five stars release in spite of its flaws -- considering the ?poque and the relevance of this work. Not to be missed, really. Well worth its price and more!
0975991477|5.0|Firstly, this book is definately beneficial and worth reading whether you agree with all of Lipton's conclusions or not.  Others have summarized and commented so well that I would only be redundant.  Instead I'd like to respond to the understandable criticism I've read in a few of the reviews...<br /><br />In response to the people who complained that the book lacked \\"tactics\\" and only pointed people in the direction of a partner's Psych-K seminar to sign up for, I totally understand this reaction.  I had this reaction too at first and I do think Lipton could have done better here.  There is nothing at all wrong with an author cross-marketing to a complementary product or service as long as the author provides significant real value in their own material. In this case Lipton undoubtedly provided this value.  Because Lipton should have handled this part much better,  don't really like giving it all 5 stars, but the book really delivers the goods overall and it had such a positive effect on me, that it deserves more than 4 stars too.  I would give 4 1/2 stars if I could.<br /><br />Lipton could have improved it by being more clear about the other other ways there are to help people change their beliefs/unwanted patterns. Lipton did clearly state that there are a number of techiques for achieving this and that Psy-K is just one of them (the one he has personally experienced).  Lipton could have been more helpful by pointing people to other general areas too. He could have done it in a way that didn't dilute his referal to the one example that he has an indirect business interest in (Psy-K) by listing some things apart from his Psy-K endorsment.  Remember,  theraputic/tactical end is not Lipton's expertise though (he's a cell biologist, not a hypnotist or other therapist) and nor does he claim or imply that he is.  For this reason, I think it would have been irresponsible of him to write about that end of it unless quoting someone else.  Seeing a very experienced hypnotist (in person) for example is the most effective way of doing this--the least time consuming and ultimately the least costly way of doing it as well. For deep-rooted beliefs it's more difficult to do it on your own.  It's not impossible though...some good resources that I know personally have worked for people are a video set titled something like \\"Thought Crimes In Taos\\" by Mark Cunningham [...], Anthony Robbins' \\"Personal Power II\\" or \\"Get The Edge\\" or \\"Mastering Influence\\" audio programs, Paul McKenna's \\"Change Your Life in Seven Days\\" cd/book (this is by far the least expensive of those I mentioned). A well trained experienced hypnotist or other professional with a track record of real results can be extremely effective though. I realized those things above may seem esoteric, but I only mention them because I know that the effective more traditional forms of therapy involve very similar tactics.  By far the most effective way to have a belief change to change behavior is a \\"significant emotional event\\" which isn't always positive (e.g. diagnosed with cancer, so you quit smoking); so the idea here is to proactively experience such emotion ahead of time so you don't have to passively wait for some other event to happen that causes you regret in waiting so long.<br /><br />From what I can tell from a brief demonstration on a video I saw, Psy-K includes a bit of muscle testing, NLP, and waking hypnosis. That was ultimately a teaser to enroll for the training seminar too though so I'm just speculating. Any of these routes (and never give up just because one wasn't right for you) have much greater chance of achieving real measurable results upon reading \\"The Biology of Belief\\"--I'll explain my reason for this opinion in the next paragraph.<br /><br />In the subject line I mentioned \\"The Most Important Belief of All...\\"  I say this because this book had a huge impact on my life because it changed one important belief in me that I was always a bit \\"wishy washy on\\": THEKNOWING THAT YOU TRULY DO HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR BELIEFS! and also how much our thoughts really do affect us on a cellular level. The book really explains this in detail which I think is very important for people who had trouble fully believing it based more on \\"faith\\" like I did. That may seem simplistic but I don't think most people are *really* convinced of this on a deep unconscious level. This book really drove that home for me and it left me with no doubt about it at all. On an intellectual level, I knew this before but it wasn't internalized because my skepticism (which serves me well in other areas) got in the way. I needed a convincing \\"show me\\" and this book did that for me. Again, I previously \\"knew\\" this on one level but it wasn't internalized. A couple of my biology classes in college and grad school would have been *much* more educational if I was exposed to Lipton's way of explaining cell biology. Instead, the pace was so fast that I crammed and memorized long lists of terms and meanings for weekly quizzes.  I now realize I didn't even understand the basics of the subject.<br /><br />This book really inspired me and it helped me \\"grow up\\" and be more accountable in some ways - something I want to continue. As a result of this book, I've experienced significant *measurable* positive results in my life where I only had fears before. A method I previously learned years ago to change my beliefs now works *much* more effectively, because I know this to be possible in the first place.CONTROL OVER YOUR BELIEFS! and also how much our thoughts really do affect us on a cellular level.

B00005JOFO|5.0|Wow...this one was a gut-punch. Breathtakingly devastating... devastatingly breathtaking. Bored into my soul in a way no movie has in decades. It is such a harsh and sad story of love and dreams unfulfilled.  And really, there is nothing sadder than that...because at the end of it all, no one wants to have \\"what if's\\" in their life. <br /> <br />While the love story is the at the core, what I got from BBM was the lesson of dreams denied.  When we deny or suppress our dreams and desires and just \\"settle\\" because we feel we must or we are made to, we wind up living a life that is less than complete...less than true.  And in so doing, the lives we touch and interact with like ripples in the water are not made fuller by our touch but are made less, are diminished by our touch, in a way. This movie has caused me to delve deep within myself and rediscover my dreams, and it has set me on a path to pursue those dreams and to become true. For that, I thank all involved with this wonderful, deeply touching story.   <br /> <br />The acting in this movie was gobsmackingly fantastic. I had never paid a whole lot of attention to either Jake Gyllenhaal or Heath Ledger before this, aside from noticing what cuties they were, and they both blew me away.  Heath Ledger WAS Ennis Del Mar - he crawled inside Annie Proulx's creation and wore him like a second skin...his performance was achingly wonderful.  Jake Gyllenhaal was the perfect balance of exuberance and dreamer...his portrayal of Jack's firm belief of the ability of his and Ennis' love to triumph if just given the chance was heartbreaking. Michelle Williams was spot-on...Alma's discovery of her husband's true love was realistically painful and difficult to watch. Anne Hathaway was the perfect Texas wife - I do think she was channeling a woman my family knew back in the day - she had the look and the sound down pat.  <br /> <br />I'm a Wyoming native, born and raised, and though just a bit younger than the characters of the movie, I did grow up in 1960's - 1980's Wyoming (the era of the story) and I grew up with those types of people - ranch and small town folks who worked damned hard just to make ends meet, drank too much beer, didn't ever show their feelings (regardless of what those feelings were), and just kept eeking out a stark existence day in and day out...worked hard, fought hard, played hard, but rarely smiled and never talked about things.   <br /> <br />The grand vistas of Wyoming (yeah, I know it was filmed in Alberta, Canada, but it was set in Wyoming), especially of Brokeback Mountain (which I interpret as being in the Big Horn Mountains), formed the perfect backdrop for the heart of the love story.  Surrounded by the majesty that Brokeback is, love just IS - no boundaries, no pre-set definitions or conventions, it just IS.  And, trust me on this, that is really how it is in those Wyoming mountains....love just IS....it lives on its own in the majestic bosom of the mountains - the pull of those mountains is strong...it lasts a lifetime - but taken out of that safe place, love becomes a fragile, and sometimes even ugly, thing.  That is why they had to go back to the mountains...never to Brokeback itself, for that would be too real and too scary for them...but into the mountains, where the beauty of that world shone a soft, safe light on their relationship.  The harsh glare of their home territories (Riverton, Childress) would have torn what they had apart, burned it to ashes...but in the mountains, they could hold it close and keep it safe. <br /> <br />The ultimate \\"lesson\\" of BBM for me is that when you deny your dreams, you deny yourself...and sentence yourself to a life less than true.  Moral of the story: ~Be true to yourself...be true to your dreams...be true.~
B000E97HIA|5.0|And because its understandable Beck and Prince almost completely do all their music instruments and all.  They both have that hint of funk and always experiment with thier music theres a reason theyve been around awhile and alblums are accepted with open arms. I admit Prince is way different than what i usually listen to but after listening to Black Sweat you can't deny Prince is back.
B000000OS2|5.0|Este es uno de esos discos que deber?an acompa?arte de por vida. Una aut?ntica maravilla. Muchos de los temas, como la preciosa \\"Paradise\\" ganan en ac?stico y el resultado es mucho mejor que en estudio. La banda al completo versionea cl?sicos de Grateful Dead, Stones, Beatles o la Creedence y los hace suyos sin problemas, rindiendo un perfecto homenaje. Muy por encima de la gran mayor?a de \\"unpluggeds\\" que desfilaron despu?s copiando esta formula. <br /> <br />No lo dudes, Tesla es una de esas grandes bandas capaces de facturar maravillas, y esta es su maravilla m?s grande.

B000089RVX|5.0|I first listen to the cd in Japan my friend brought it along.  I made a music vidio out of the song haunted.  the cd is a great one.  All 12 of the songs make the cd worth it. I give the cd a ten out of ten.  It is easy to listin to the songs over and over for me. And I have been told that in its self is a merical.  out of all my cd it is the only one i can do that with. sorry for repeating myself alot. but i hope this helped.
B000E6ESL2|1.0|This is a really really bad movie. Rent it destroy it and return it. If you want to see Naomi Watts in a good moive rent ELLIE PARKER it's way better and so much smarter.
B00000J28K|1.0|Sorry, but any lauding of this overbearingly dull band bemuses me. Their lyrics are terrible, their music lacks either finess or punch and it all packages together to make them the epitome of Radio 2, MOR mediocrity which is a blight on our music scene.
B000002UDB|5.0|If you give this brilliant Beatles album anything less than four stars you've got issues.BACK TO THIS ALBUM,IT IS FANTASTIC SO GO AND BUY IT TODAY.
0786867973|5.0|This book, is the one cookbook that I think I refer to more than any other. Given that I adore baking, and holding the odd tea party is my favourite form of entertaining, this book has certainly paid dividends many times over.     The recipes are visually exciting, they are, for the most part fairly simple to make for the experienced baker, although you may find some of her ingredients a little tricky to obtain outside big cities. That aside, she often provides substitution choices for the more obscure of ingredients. This book is fantastic for those with some baking experience. New bakers: instructions are very clear, but some recipes have a large number of ingredients and can be a little tricky, so I'd advise to start with something a little more basic initially.
B000002KOO|5.0|Music is one of my passions and as a collector of most all genres, I personally think that this CD is one of the finest in musical history. It's a crying shame that Peter Green fell to LSD and never recovered his career after leaving Fleetwood Mac. I truly believe that if he continued his cunning originality with Fleetwood Mac he'd be known today as one of the best musicians like Eric Clapton and other like minded performers.
B000000OAL|4.0|'Queen' the debut was not fairly received by the rock press in 1973 but then again, Queen, like Black Sabbath, would have to wait to receive their just due as rock innovators and legends. A curious foursome made up of graduate students who hobbied as musicians, Queen remain in many ways the definitive 'group' as each member contributed his fair share of classics. Not even The Beatles could claim that each of their four members penned a Top Ten Hit!! John Deacon, the quiet one, played steady bass. Roger Taylor was the wild man with shrieking singing voice and influential drumming. Brian May, one of the alltime greats and also had an incredibly unique guitar sound (no doubt due to his homemade fireplace wood axe and pense as a pick!) Faruhk Bulsura, as he was born. became Freddie Mercury at the dawn of the seventies, and rock hatched another icon! On their debut, Queen seems to do what they always did best, a combination of metal guitar rock with amazing harmonies and inclectic song styles. Favorites include opener \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\", metal monster \\"Liar\\" (never ever let you in!), Great King Rat (the line \\"Now listen all you people\\" still gives me chills. \\"Son and Daughter\\" seems to have a Sabbath influence and \\"My Fairy King\\" has some of the most preposterous lyrics ever, but it works. This album has a strong Christian influence besides the obvious inclusion of \\"Jesus\\". Were the boys on a born-again kick at the time?? Don't care, as they would go on to bigger and better things, still the rock idols despite the hatred of critics. \\"Mad the Swine\\" is goofy so if your version doesn't have it, don't be bummed, it's pretty much a typical outtake. \\"Loved a million women in a belladonic haze?\\" With Queen you were always in good hands, even back in '73.
B000062YAZ|1.0|Wow, if I wanted to know what noise sounded like, I would have bought this album.  You can't even hear what the frickin' guy is singing.  All the songs sound the same.  And they all equally suck for that matter.  Death Metal is the trashiest, sorriest excuse for a music genre I've ever heard of.  For starters, no I am not Christian, I am atheist.  So I am not complaining about the religious aspects.  I am complaining about how it doesn't even sound like music to begin with.  Sounds like a bunch of drunken monkeys that have an IQ of 12 and have no coordination. <br /> <br />Slayer is probably the worst band ever, and is the biggest embarassment to hit the stereo.  The lyrics mean nothing, the rhythms are way too overused...save this album for the garbage can.
0790731940|4.0|From the director of \\"Lethal Weapon\\" and \\"Superman\\" and it shows.  Really enjoyed this film.  Spectacular shots of the West - shot in Yosemite.  Mel Gibson is looking old - like early 40s - but his blue eyes and long lashes are still something.  He's too comic here, as he has been of late.  I much preferred him in \\"Mrs. Soffell\\" and \\"Hamlet\\".  And James Garner was perfect - all cool to Gibson's manic energy.  And tons and tons of cameos, from Danny Glover, to Doug McClure, to Robert Fuller.  But Gibson was not as smooth as Garner in the original \\"Maverick\\", nor in fact did he seem to have the same confidence in himself.  The movie was entertaining but gimmicky, from the borrowings from \\"Lethal Weapon\\" and \\"Raiders\\" to Graham Greene's wisecracking Indian.  It was just a little too precious.  Gibson should go back to serious stuff. (And look what he does now!) I must admit the ending caught me.  I had not a clue.  But as a fun movie, it definitely works.  James Coburn must be mentioned.  He looked great, sounded great, was great.  How old is he anyway?  Mel Gibson should age so well.  And a beautiful old steamboat.  Plot was all about poker and money, what else?
B0002V7OI8|4.0|For the most part, movies in the natural disaster genre are both silly and ridiculous (think \\"Twister\\", \\"Volcano\\" and \\"The Core\\" even though I enjoyed them all) in spite of their efforts to the contrary. \\"Deep Impact\\" manages to succeed where the others fail. The movie feels rather somber in tone which gives the gravity of the situation its weight.     Two astronomy students debate the name and type of an object in space while on a star gazing trip. Unbeknownst to both, it turns out to be a comet hurdling in a destructive path towards Earth. As the dire nature of the circumstance takes over the planet, the viewer witnesses relationships breaking, relationships mending and heart wrenching realizations about mortality among other seemingly authentic life happenstances. The movie's special effects are breathtaking, especially scenes of a large comet fragment crashing in the Atlantic Ocean and its ensuing destruction. As a side note, this movie was made well before September 11, 2001 and I must say, knowing that the World Trade Center was essentially destroyed by fire, it's odd and rather poignant to see it engulfed by water.    Many of the actors are distinguished however their performances are hit and miss. Tea Leoni, who I enjoy in other movies, seems oddly out of place as the reporter who breaks the story of Earth's possible destruction. Morgan Freeman, who never seems to give a bad performance, plays the President of the Unites States and he's very effective. He just exudes authority (see the interaction between his character and Tea Leoni's in what I believe is the White House cellar). Robert Duvall, who is one of Hollywood's most respected actors, surprisingly lacks passion. Most of the remaining cast's performances are adequate to fine.    All in all, I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable.
B0001O3YC6|4.0|A lot of films that are monster based(\\"creature features\\" as I call them), there's a certain noticeable borrowing feeling throughout the film, as if filmmakers got lazy and said \\"hm...Alien but underground!\\" which is why we got crap like the Cave. Now and then we do have an enjoyable romp such as Starship Troopers but for the most part they're kind of lame, underwritten, boring or all 3. Nobody's gonna call Pitch Black art but at least it's very entertaining, even if the premise seems done before(\\"Aliens during the nighttime!\\"). <br /> <br />A transport ship crash lands on a planet which has 3 suns in orbit nearby. It's not the most comfortable planet since it's so hot but that's the least of their problems. Among the survivors is an escaped convict, Riddick, and in the shadows of caves lurks a large enemy with a huge case of the munchies, namely humans. So really the film is about getting off the planet before being lunch...or is it supper? <br /> <br />Oddly enough, one of the film's selling points was its hero, or rather, its anti-hero Riddick. Caring only for himself and would step over best friends and probably family to stay alive, he's the definition of a criminal you don't want to cross paths with(well, isn't all of them like that?).  Played by Vin Diesel, he's certainly a memorable villain that's actually likable which is quite something. The rest of the cast is good but 2 standouts with Keith David as a Muslim and Radha Mitchell as Fry(she's otherwise known as the Silent Hill girl or Ally Sheedy's makeout partner in one film). <br /> <br />The special effects at times look slightly obvious but all in all they're well done, including \\"Riddick vision\\" and the \\"Monster vision\\": 2 distinct styles of seeing, one being very luminescent night-vision esque while the other is extremely odd looking. The pacing is perfect with a slow opening that slowly builds tension without just action action the entire way through. The transfer is kind of disappointing as the first half where we see the planet being lit by 3 suns looks clear and crisp while the darkness scenes look really grainy at times. <br /> <br />Originally, Pitch Black was going to be the sequel to a trilogy, which got its start with the underperforming Chronicles of Riddick. This prequel of sorts is what it should've been: a good time with a memorable villain and interesting visuals.
0792841344|1.0|For a long time, I had heard about Phantasm being considered of the all-time horror classics.  I never watched it because when I read about it, the plot never really interested me.  Turns out that I was right...<br /><br />The basic plot (if you could call it that) of Phantasm is that two brothers get somehow pulled into the weird antics occurring at the local funeral home/cemetery in their town.  While at a friend's funeral, one of the brothers witnesses \\"the Tall Man\\" lifting up an occupied coffin on his own, and putting it back in the hearse even though it is supposed to be being buried.  A weird occurrence like that encourages the brothers to break in to the funeral home, where they witness......something, I'm not even sure what.  It consists of flying metal balls that drill into people's skulls, weird midgets in druid outfits, and a portal to another planet.<br /><br />The real hindrance to Phantasm was its inability to play out smoothly.  Don Coscarelli, in his directorial debut, uses way too many cuts and switches scenes in a frenetic, chaotic fashion that just leave the viewer confused.  And the ending, I won't spoil it, but dear Lord, I felt like I had just wasted an entire evening watching this supposedly great horror movie that turned out to be a total fluke.  To top it all off, there were about two good gory moments in the entire movie, absolutely nothing to keep a horror fan interested, in my opinion.  It isn't the worst movie I've seen, so for that reason, I'm giving it 1.5 stars instead of just 1, but suffice it to say that I am totally missing the boat when it comes to why this film is so beloved in the horror community.
B000E994KE|5.0|AMORPHIS - Eclipse  -  Amorphis has had an interesting musical journey...   They are credited at being one of the originators of Melodic Death Metal with their albums, `The Karelian Isthmus' (1992) and `Tales from the Thousand Lakes' (1994).  They began the blending of Singing with their abrasive vocals on (What most would call) their masterpiece, `Elegy' (1996).   Losing the growls the band released a very different, yet still intriguing album in 1999 titled Tuonela.  Blending Prog, Hard-Rock, with a more traditional Folk style...  Sadly the new millennium was not as kind to Amorphis.  `Am Universum' (2000) was alright but really just not the `Amorphis' that people had come to know... 2003's `Far From the Sun' was decent, but more of a straight-forward rock album.  Shortly after this album long time vocalist Pasi Koskinen, left the band... he was replaced by Tomi Joutsen.   This brings us to 2006, and the release of `Eclipse', which is their strongest release since Elegy...    -Eclipse opens with Two Moons which is a perfect intro... Some fancy keyboard work which is pushed by powerful, driving guitars.  The second, Tomi's voice comes in all my `new vocalist' worries were washed away... His combination of aggressive hard-rock vocals with his haunting singing voice is a perfect balance.  The bass and drum work, as always is exceptionally tight.  -Track two, House of Sleep is the finest rock song I have heard in years... this song is simply fantastic.  With no pun intended this song eclipses any of Amorphis's previous attempts at catchy, hard-rock.  The piano work during the last minute is outstanding.   -Leaves Scar, is a return to the days of Elegy... combining some well executed growls with some nice singing.  The guitar work on this track shines back to the Thousand Lakes days... This song has a big Folk vibe... Very cool.   -The fourth song is Born from Fire, a solid track, although compared to the first four tracks it just seems good and not great.  However ithas an incredible guitar solo...  -Under a Soil and Black Stone, is perfectly placed at track five.  An emotive piece with some great piano work during the intro... the song builds really nicely, growing heavier and climaxing with a fantastic guitar solo.  The song then closes back out with the piano and fades into...  -Perkele (The God of Fire), which is a pure tour de force... The vocals, play really well between the death growls and the clean singing.  This song is a big plus for fans from the Thousand Lakes era.  -Track seven is, The Smoke, a solid track overall... just nothing particular outstanding.  -The progressive sounding, Same Flesh follows... The rhythm section shines on this track... dishing out a powerful back-drop for the guitars and vocals.  -Track nine is the folk-driven Brother Moon... another fantastic track.  This song is so musically precise, I love the intricate drum work.    -The closer is the beautiful Empty Opening, a stunning track which perfectly closes out the album.  -And finally, just when you thought the CD was over they unleash the Secret song, [Track 11] Stone Woman.    A nice bonus to have...  Another rocking track.    Conclusion...   It is in the Top 3 of 2006 thus far... Fantastic Musicianship, Excellent Vocals, and an album that just plain kicks ass!!!    Favorite Songs:  House of Sleep, Leaves Scar, Under a Soil and Black Stone, Two Moons and Same Flesh.  -5 Stars       IF YOU LIKED, AGREED OR APPRECIATED THIS.

0385512104|4.0|This book is rather nice in terms of the originality of its style i.e. the way the author impersonates someone with autism going off on tangents all the time. <br /> <br />Another way in which he impersonates the thinking of autistics is the way Christopher does all these things that upset members of his family greatly, but has no apparent understanding of the upset his actions cause everyone. <br /> <br />One thing I would question the realism of is how Christopher became overwhelmed by the large number of advertisements in the tube station.  I know that many autistics can find it disconcerting if they hear sounds from many different sources simultaneously, but this is the first time I have ever heard of this happening with regard to visual input. <br /> <br />I would like to point out that not all autistics are this sentimental about animals.  I myself have Asperger's syndrome (a subsection of autism, a diagnosis being given normally when the person being diagnosed hasn't displayed any significant linguistic delay and actually wants to form social relationships, but finds this difficult), but I cannot understand why on earth Christopher would actually bother doing a murder investigation about the death of a dog.  It reminds me of when I saw my aunty performing physiotherapy on one of her cats; you see the cat howling at the top of his voice and my aunty Shena getting bitten and you start thinking, \\"why would Shena actually bother?  That is just a cat!  If he gets better, then fine, but if not, it doesn't bother me, because that is just a cat!\\".
0141439661|4.0|Most people who have read Jane Austen will have read Pride and Prejudice.  With a title like Sense and Sensibility, most readers will assume that the two books can be interpreted and enjoyed in the same way.  Other than having three word titles that employ alliteration in the first and third words, the two novels are more different than similar.<br /><br />While Pride and Prejudice is primarily about miscommunication, Sense and Sensibility is about the maturation of two sisters as they find themselves confronted by adversity.  The former topic allows Ms. Austen more room to roam, but within the later topic she has plenty of opportunities to display her story telling and comic talents.  While maturation is an important sub theme in Pride and Prejudice, you see maturation better developed in Sense and Sensibility.<br /><br />When their father dies, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret find themselves in exile from their family home with their mother.  The family estate had been left to their half brother whom their father exhorted to take care of them.  But that promise is soon diluted into doing almost nothing through the selfishness of his wife and his vacillation.  A relative kindly offers them a country cottage near his home and takes obvious pleasure in their company.<br /><br />At this modest new home, Elinor found herself entertaining the welcome attentions of Edward Ferrars.  Elinor's younger sister, Marianne, is all aflutter over John Willoughby who seems to be committed to her.  In fact, everyone assumes that there will soon be wedding bells for Marianne and Willoughby.<br /><br />All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted.  Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne.  Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship.  As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon.  Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium.

B0001AP12G|4.0|What a breath of fresh air young Mr. West was with this album. <br /> <br />Hip hop wasn't ready for this in spring 2004 and I wonder how many Kanye \\"Late Registration\\" bandwagon jumpers will look back at this LP and appreciate it for what it was. <br /> <br />Kanye West, like all men and women, is a contradiction.  He's your classic tormented soul who exclaims the virtues of the \\"good, positive\\" side of life while ultimately acknowledging his imperfection and weakness to fall victim to the same evils he rejects. <br /> <br />But that's the point of this album and that's what makes it so creative, artistic, poetic and even inspiring. <br /> <br />The problem with hip hop music today is that everyone finds one gimmick or one hustle, sticks to that comfort zone and tries to sell, sell, sell until fans get tired of 'em. <br /> <br />On \\"College Dropout\\" you get nothing but a multi-dimensional view of Kanye West, painting this one person as \\"that individual\\" masses all relate to but for different reasons. <br /> <br />You can expect brilliant production on this album.  Say what you will about Kanye's flow (it got better on Late Registration if you ask me). <br /> <br />But what's so chilling about Kanye's rhymes are the diversity of lyrics and subject matter.   <br /> <br />This same dude who promotes safe sex, God, education and an overall ambitious, prideful attitude is the same person on this LP who also talks about drugs, his sexual appetite, his even bigger ego and gives a big middle finger to any and all in his life who deemed him a failure because he didn't finish college. <br /> <br />Do you understand, relate to and agree with all of the aforementioned? Probably not. <br /> <br />So take this album for what is it ... a reflection of the life experiences of one person. <br /> <br />\\"College Dropout\\" is a kaleidoscope reflecting every stage of life, every success, every failure, every strength and every flaw of this dude. <br /> <br />If you get \\"that\\" point, you'll appreciate this album as a Tour de force of what it is to be human. <br /> <br />If I lost you or if this is confusing, don't get this album. <br /> <br />It doesn't have the one-track, single-mindedness of your typical party-drink & party some more rapper or of your fake gangsta wannabes lyin' about how hard they are. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000244FDW|5.0|If there's one thing that really gets on my nerves it is taking a really, really, good book such as Pride And Prejudice and changing the story.  Fortunately, this version is 100% taken from the book. <br /> <br />It's as if the characters step out of the pages of the book and perform a play that is delightful to watch.  They even look like I imagine them to look like from the book. <br /> <br />Several years ago Hollywood did a film version where Greer Garson played Elizabeth.  Now, while Greer Garson is a superb actress, she was a tad old to play Elizabeth convincingly. <br /> <br />The locations in this adatption are lovely and perfect.  I really feel as I am visiting the places Jane Austen wrote about. <br /> <br />I saw the more recent A&E version and I didn't like it nearly as much because as I mentioned it really gets on my nerves when they change a really good book for movies or television. <br /> <br />So if you want a faithful version of Jane Austen's superb book, get the BBC version!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Firefly was cancelled prematurely, so it never had a chance to deliver a series finale (ala Mash, Friends, Sienfeld, etc.)  This movie acts as that finale.<br /><br />Be sure to watch it after you watch the series.<br /><br />I suspect that people who watch it cold will have mixed feelings about it.  There is very little preamble for the uninitiated.  The writers wrote it with current fans in mind and simply used the relationships and characters they had built during the series.<br /><br />That said, if you watched the series, you must watch this to see how they summed it up.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I have seen this movie so many times...and each time I can honestly say I can glean something additional that I hadn't gotten before.  This film is a psychological exploration of an individual who falls away from the social norms and in doing so builds a wall between himself and reality.  From his early days as a child longing for a father and his mother's attention to his assent into a rockstar Pink longs for someone to give him what he needs, which is approval.  He is able to obtain this through various means but always subsequently sabotages these efforts.  Each one of these incidents creates \\"another brick in the wall\\" between Pink and reality.  He subsequently succumbs to being completely shut off from the norms of society and begins to create his own. He then is labeled by some as a villian and others as a hero.  His own self-hatred leads him to hate all others who are different than conventional standards so that he might gain acceptance.  When his \\"wall\\" is forced to come down what will be the consequences?   <br />I find this to be quite compelling and the visual presentation is stimulating and awe-inspiring.  This is the perfect movie for someone with ADHD (this is a compliment) because there is always a constantly changing presentation from live action to animation, from past to present.  The fantastic music from the album Pink Floyd's The Wall (which the film is based and inspired from) is the dialogue and narrative and is the perfect background to the images flashing across the screen.  Not only is the presentation stimulating to the senses but the story gives much food for thought.  Highly recommended for multiple viewings.
1576753700|5.0|Was kann man zu so einem tollen Album noch sagen? Jeder Song ist, meiner Meinung nach, eine Abwechslung. <br>Deswegen halte ich es auch für gut, jeden Song selbst zu &quot;kommentieren&quot;.<br />&quot;Helena&quot;- Der Song ist einfach der Anfang von allem. Es war nicht der erste Song der von diesem Album veröffentlicht wurde, aber durch ihn sind wohl viele auf My Chemical Romance aufmerksam geworden. Einfach ein genialer Song!<br />&quot;Give 'em Hell, Kid&quot;- Dieser Song beginnt schon gut! Der Gitarrensound ist einfach perfekt! Einfach einer der besten Songs von Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge... leider zu kurz ;)<br />&quot;To The End&quot;- Fantastische Strophen... leider `verdirbt` der Refrain, das tolle Stück, meiner Meinung nach!<br />&quot;You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison&quot;- Der Titel schreckt manche vielleicht ab, aber dieser Song ist einer der besten auf dem Album! Es beginnt ein bisschen ruhiger, aber spätestens beim Refrain geht es richtig los!<br />&quot;I'm Not Okay&quot;- Hört sich sehr froh und Pop-Mäßig an, ist er aber ganz und gar nicht, wenn man auf den Text hört. Definitiv einer der besten Songs von MCR!<br />&quot;The Ghost Of You&quot;- Einfach nur genial!!! Ein etwas ruhigerer Song, aber so voller Gefühle und Emotionen, dass man an der ein oder anderen Stelle sogar das ein oder andere Tränchen in den Augen hat wenn man sich voll auf den Song konzentriert!<br />&quot;The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You&quot;- Ein Super Song bei dem (vorerst) alles stimmt. Tolle Strophen, ein noch besserer Refrain... naja, aber dann kommt nach knapp 2 Minuten diese seltsame Stelle die einfach nicht in so einen tollen Song passt!<br />&quot;Interlude&quot;- Mit dem Song konnte ich nicht sonderlich viel anfangen... eigentlich gehört er an den Anfang des Albums oder ganz an den Schluss. Er wäre besser als &quot;Intro&quot; oder &quot;Outro&quot; geeignet!<br />&quot;Thank You For The Venom&quot;- Zu dem Song kann ich gar nicht vielsagen, einfach nur gut!!!<br />&quot;Hang 'em High&quot;- Obwohl der Text, wie eigentlich jeder des Albums, eigentlich düster ist, macht der Song und die Melodie gute Laune. Es ist nicht mein Lieblingssong, aber auf jeden Fall ist er nicht schlecht!!!<br />&quot;It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's A Deathwish&quot;- Ein guter Song, mit einem tollen Refrain. Leider ist er ein wenig unspäktakulär und wahrscheinlich nicht sofort wieder erkennbar, was ich aber nicht weiter dramatisch finde!<br />&quot;Cemetery Drive&quot;- Mein Lieblingssong von dem Album!!! Hört sich zuerst auch froh an, aber hat wahrscheinlich den düstersten Text. Aber gerade der text ist sooo gut, dazu kommt noch eine geniale Melodie... hach, ich könnte mir den Song den ganzen Tag anhören :)<br />&quot;I Never Told You What I Do For A Living&quot;- Auch einer meiner Lieblingssongs... was kann man noch dazu sagen? Guter Text, tolle Melodie...<br />Alles in allem hat das Album vielleicht 1-2 &quot;schwächere&quot; Songs, aber es ist nicht so, dass man bei diesen unbedingt wegschalten muss!
B000BTJDGC|4.0|this is decent for a movie. in general, the movie was not scary at all. dont get me wrong, some parts would have been scary if they were not 5 minute flashes. so bottom line, do not rent this with all your friends expecing something scary. <br /> <br />other than that, it was actually a pretty good movie. i liked how it was set up different than most other movies (like switching from the trial to the exorcism... pretty good film making.) The trial was intriguing and it kept me ino the movie for a while. The effects are pretty cool, like the part where emily is hallucinating and all the people look disfigured. That by the way is pretty much the scariest part in the movie. <br /> <br />One more thing, this unrated sh*t has to stop. there was no nudity, no violence, no blood, no cursing, so why call it unrated. honestly, it is an advertising thing. so, watch it because its good, not because it is scary or unrated.
B000BVD460|1.0|This CD truly represents the stupidity that is called \\"music\\" in today's world. none of these songs have any depth whatsoever and the lyrics make me wonder if he hired a preschooler to write them. if you want to hear a man complain about his wife and kids, you should become a therapist...it beats listening to this garbage.
B000031WD9|5.0|my friends showed me this movie promising me that it would be good. and was it...yeah. i have never laughed so hard at a movie ever. this movie is simply an enjoyable movie so if your like all the uptight people who dont want to have a good time than dont watch this.   <br /> <br />like all comedies, the plot is very simple, 4 teens make a pact to loose their virginity by prom. also, for all the people who said its unrealistic, i have made well \\"pacts\\" with friends to do something similar and i do play lacrosse, high school has changed since you were here to ever1 who said no 1 plays lacrosse. back to the movie. there are so many classic and memorable parts (the pie scene, nadia) and other funny parts (the sex book ect...) all that made me laugh hysterically.  <br />i highly recommened this movie just remember, its for your enjoyment, get friends food, drinks, and enjoy laughing hysterically at this ver funny comedy.

B0001VNZQO|2.0|Allein das Cover ist schon übel, selten hässlich. Über die Musik braucht man nicht viele Worte verlieren, sie ist schlicht und einfach nur schlecht. Die CD tut niemandem weh, dafür gibt's zwei Sterne. Allerdings hat die Welt auf so eine popmusikalische Balanglosigkeit nicht gewartet, P!nk überrascht nicht - auch das ist keine Überraschung.
0375830995|1.0|As my title suggests, much, much less than I'd expected.<br /><br />Having just finished \\"The Book Thief\\" by the same author, I could hardly wait to get my hands this book; unfortunately they are as different as night and day.<br /><br />The book had an intriguing cover and the story started reasonably enough, but then quickly became unbelievable with unlikely clues and convenient solutions. Then, to make matters worse, the ending is even more far-fetched than the main story itself. About half way through, I found myself starting to skim the chapters (not a good sign) just to get finished faster.<br /><br />As I sit and write this review I find it hard to believe that the genius that penned \\"The Book Thief\\" (a book so deeply moving and beautiful that I was saddened to see it end) was the same person who wrote this book of such...of such questionable quality.<br /><br />All in all, I wished I'd passed on this book.  1 Star<br /><br />Addendum; Aug.18, 2007<br /><br />Having read other peoples' reviews on this book, I wonder if they've read \\"The Book Thief\\" by the same author. That book, IMHO, is so superior to 'I Am the Messenger' that I still find it hard to believe that both novels were written by the same person.<br /><br />However, in trying to be objective, I've tried to put myself in the position of what I would have thought of 'I Am the Messenger ', IF, I'd not read 'The Book Thief ' first. Honestly, I feel I probably would not have trashed 'I Am the Messenger' as I did in my review, but still could not give it anymore than 2 stars.<br /><br />But, having read 'The Book Thief' first, I stand by my critical review of 'I Am the Messenger '.
0743454537|5.0|I loved this book. i tell everyone to check it out, i know they wont be able to put it down. Its amazing and the ending is one of the best endings i have ever read.
B00000ING2|2.0|What really bothered me about Hudsucker Proxy: Capitalism is the wonder of the world providing food and subsidence to everyone, even Communist slaves and Fascist toady's under a democratic people; yet, Hollywood insists on blasting Corporate Culture, when the overwhelming majority of businessmen are not only honest, they are exemplary.  <br /> <br />So much Hollywood talent and money wasted on a bad idea, so what else is new?  The Coen's have jumped the shark with this take off of the American Screwball Comedy of the 30's.  I cringed every time Jennifer Jason Leigh tried to imitate Katharine Hepburn's classic gargle.  The poor actress may have destroyed her career with this stinker.  <br /> <br />I can't stand Tim Robbin's politics, but must admit that he is the best actor to play a fool in the movies.  He almost carries this farce.  Paul Newman; however, is collecting a check.  He's been collecting checks since the 50's.  His salad dressing stinks too. <br /> <br />I'm amazed at how much money the Coen's command in Hollywood on such flimsy pitches.  I loved Fargo and enjoyed The Big Lebowski (not as much as some cult fans), but this film, why did they bother? <br />
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Director Ang Lee eases into a topic as touchy as Iraq with a gentle approach. A 60s setting, some gorgeous scenery, a methodical, patient pace, yet half way through the movie, you realize that not only are you watching two guys kissing (when was the last time you saw that? Heck, have I ever seen that?), but that they are going to simulate sex (without the genitals) right there on the screen and you, if you are brave enough, are going to sit through it!<br /><br />(I asked my girlfriend to hold my hand. Girls: it takes a real man to see this movie. Let them take you to a horror movie - you get them back and take them to this.)<br /><br />Despite all of these political and sexual asides, this is an awesome movie. I recently saw \\"Walk the Line\\" again on cable (already!). While it is a wonderful portrayal of Johnny Cash, it is not an stirringly emotional movie like Brokeback Mountain. It is no surprise to me that \\"Brokeback\\" jokes are already in the vernacular of the day. This movie has a profound impact of our current culture.<br /><br />Heath Ledger and Jake \\"G-something-unpronounceable\\" do a wonderful job. Though they are on the screen through-out the entire movie, they carry the burden as lightly as a T-shirt. Ledger will never be thought lightweight again. There is more acting here than \\"Capote.\\" There is more emotion here than \\"Crash.\\" This was the best movie of the year.<br /><br />As difficult as homosexual love is to comprehend (for what, the last 2 million years?), this movie makes it real, tangible, tender and poignant. It is story writing, telling and acting at its best. If you like \\"Unforgiven\\" or \\"Million Dollar Baby,\\" you will like this movie.
B000003TSP|5.0|There's nothing like Portishead and nothing like their 2nd album. Its darker, creepier, and more haunting than the first. The entire album has an overal similar sound which makes for a more themed and theatrical sonic experience. I like this better than the first album which had the obvious singles and dabblings in various spectrums of trip-hop which now resembles everyone from tricky to morcheeba. However on this 2nd release, Portishead holds their own, establishing their own trademarked sound: an eerie, slow-paced death-orchestra led by a sultry singer with a heart of black-gold. This music will get into your brain and eat away like bad acid. Exquisite production and smart use of turntables. From the intro of eerie high pitched twinklings over a heartbeat that lead into twangy strums of electric guitar and record scratching, to the last song which ends with the sampled vocals of an old bluesman pining about hookers and gin, this is a masterpiece recording. Goes well with a late-night martini and captures the dreary mood of a cool, misty morning in Autumn just after it has rained and the fog is still hanging in the air...
1563523302|5.0|This book is excellent.  It is one of the few \\"wealth building books\\" on the market of which I am aware that doesn't just rely on the opinion of a single or a few authors on how to obtain wealth.  Instead it relies on data from the lives of literally thousands of millionaires... how THEY did it.  Because of this, a \\"get rich quick\\" mentality is not illustrated with pleasant-to-hear untruths stated as if they were facts.  Instead there is just solid, sound advice.        In addition to showing how others have obtained financial security, there is excellent insight into how to instill positive character traits and avoid serious negative consequences w/ children, grandchildren and other family members and friends once wealth is obtained.  Again, this is based on data collected from thousands of millionaires (both successful and unsuccessful in this regard), not just a chosen few.      For these two reasons this book deserves 5 stars and will be of tremendous benefit to any reader, regardless of his or her economic situation.
B000ERU6QC|5.0|more of the same stripper boogie rock, which makes this essential summertime bbq muzak. j devil is one of the great frontmen in music today, he's just so damn happy to be there bringing his rock to the world and you can ride the wave of his enthusiasm. it's not hard for a band to get hyped due to a nice afro or other hairdo but the devil is actually getting known for his goddamn MUSTACHE. ha! that's just ridiculous. <br /> <br />anyways, \\"death by sexy\\" keeps the vibe of \\"peace, love and death metal\\" alive, so if you liked that one, you will theoretically dig this one too. josh homme, though, does NOT play drums on this album. not at all. that job goes to queens dude joey castillo who kills in everything he does, whether its complicated drum lines or braindead retard beats. he keeps the asses shaking here, no doubt.  <br /> <br />homme does play bass throughout the record, which adds some serious depth to the sound (since the first album had almost no bass at all). now, i'm not gonna say that josh should be on the cover of \\"bass player\\" magazine or anything, but this cat just can't do anything wrong... there's some really nice, odd melodic bass grooves here, specifically \\"solid gold\\" where josh sounds like paul mccartney or something. and looking back at homme's resume on bass... queens s/t (that was NOT oliveri on that album), various desert sessions tunes, and \\"lullubies to paralize\\"... this guy is a more than competant bass player. i have a bigtime, non-gay man crush on this guy. he's the DUDE. i'd buy a shrinkwrapped turd with his name on it. maybe. um, probably not now that i read it. <br /> <br />buy this, put it on and get yer girlfriend(s) drunk. you'll probably get laid. <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I watched the import and I was stunned at the CG scenes very detailed! PlayStation 3 anyone? And the score to this movie will kick you in the face!

Japan is good at the CG scenes and voice dialog etc.Awsome!!.And all the FFVII are in this movie \\"I won't tell you anymore details your just going to have to buy this Killer dvd SE!..when its released in USA A++++++++
6302548748|5.0|Soon after Ted Turner released this movie to the theaters for show my father and I drove out to Towson to see it.It was one of the last things we actually did together as he died a few years later.  <br /> <br />We're both Civil War buffs among other things. Avidly read much on the subject. Killer Angels being among those books we read.  <br /> <br />Seeing the movie was logical.  <br /> <br />We were not disapointed in our expectations. Far from it. <br /> <br />It was long but we wished it were even longer as the content was histoicly accurate and well packed. Performances were excellant. Jeff Daniells as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain was super superb. Only Martin Sheen's peformance as Robert E. Lee was better. We loved the music. We loved the costuming. We loved the fighting scenes. Everything was great.   <br /> <br />If anything could be deemed a fault it is that it is not longer and filled with even more scenes.
B00005NIL9|5.0|* with the possible exception of Derek & the Dominoes <br /> <br />However if you mix both bands and shake well you get Lynyrd Skynyrd. That's right , the sustain Allen Collins practised so hard to obtain is all over this record. When the reissue came out(with bonus tracks),I took my regular copy and put it in my step-daughters car CD player and told her to enjoy. She's 24 and hasn't quit listening to it yet. That was three years ago!The blues-rock-soul wail of Paul Rodgers Transends Generations. This is quite frankly ,the best record Free ever made. And could very well be the very best record to come out of the English blues-rock scene(Derek & the Dominoes included too many americans to be considered British!).Dynamic from begining to end. The obvious songs are \\"All Right Now\\" & \\"Fire and Water\\". however , the others are every bit as strong. \\"Mr. Big\\" , \\"Heavy Load\\" and \\"Oh I Wept\\" are extraordinarily awesome. Paul Kossoff before the drugs ravaged his concentration. Andy Fraser at his thunder-loping best.Simon Kirke is the heartbeat every band needs (and Bad Company later enjoyed).Paul Rodgers is simply the best rock singer since , since , well probably since his inspiration , Otis Redding. <br /> <br />Hyperbole , perhaps. I couldn't begin to give an objective review of this record. Quite frankly it changed my life. It must be heard to be believed. What A Band!
B0006GAI6O|3.0|I really shouldn't watch a movie with the Director's Commentary before I review the film formally, but I often do. A film, like a really good book, or fine music should be able to stand on its own merits; at least that's what I've been taught. But understanding moreso Mr Chelsom's thought process and his decision making in regard to Shall We Dance has helped to raise my rating from two to three stars.  <br /> <br />In an industry where Ego is often everything to many an actor, I'm surprised and pleased that Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Jennifer Lopez play such understated roles. Part of this is following direction I suppose, but I find all these actors to be so self-confident in themselves and their acting abilities that they don't seem to mind the restraint. <br /> <br />John Clark (Gere) does not go off the proverbial deep end, and his mid-life crisis is to be more aptly described as `mid-life questions.' He doesn't take the obligatory mistress, though he might have thought about it. He doesn't run out and purchase a motorcycle or take up base jumping. He just wants something a bit more, and so Ballroom Dancing comes into his life. <br /> <br />Wife Beverly (Sarandon), though just as much the professional (Saks Fifth Avenue) as attorney Clark, has worked equally as hard to provide a good home and, despite 20-someodd-years, is still deeply in love with her husband.  <br /> <br />Paulina (Lopez) is just what she needs to be for this film, a woman who remembers a significant professional disappointment and perhaps a personal one as well. She joins Miss Mitzi's to heal her mind and retrain her body. Lopez takes a lot of hits: \\"She can't act. She can't sing. She's not really a dancer.\\" Well, pooh on all of that! She does a number of things quite well, including her part in this film.  <br /> <br />It's a curious dichotomy that two of the `secondary' or supporting actors, Lisa Ann Walter and Stanley Tucci really go over the top. Lisa Ann is a bit too much for me, but since I'm a fan, I must forgive her. Besides, she seems to be having so much fun. As for Tucci, Mr Chelsom instructs us that he really had to stretch and work against his own persona for this roll. I'm intrigued to the point that I'd like to see some more of his work (He's a Director as well.) Anita Gillette is just enough of a `ditz' to be fun but not an embarrassment to the Human Race. In fact, it's obvious she cares for her students, though they can often exasperate her to imbibe. <br /> <br />Even the third tier actors, including Richard Jenkins, Bobby Cannavale and Omar Miller, are given credible roles and are delightful to watch in their efforts. Jenkin's efforts as the Detective almost go against type. He's not sleazy and smarmy but basically a nice guy who seems to care about people and their wellbeing. Nick Cannon's role as Scott is such a throwaway, I didn't recognize him until I read the credits. Tamara Hope and Stark Sands as the Clark kids are more than normal; they're even quite likeable. <br /> <br />The sets and B unit shots are adequate if not expensively budgeted. The dancing (excepting Lopez) is that of accomplished novices, as purported by the story-line. But note that Gere has by determination and study made himself quite presentable. The music is varied to fit its assigned purpose and makes for a fun soundtrack. Several legitimate stars of the Ballroom Dancing World are inserted into various cameos (Be certain to view the alternate beginning scene.) <br /> <br />Try not to compare to the famous and fabulous dance films of the past - and not even to the Japanese version of the same title. Kick back and enjoy it on its own merits, as the light romantic comedy it is. And be sure to add the Director's commentary perhaps during the third or fourth viewing? <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm thinking Three Stars and maybe a little more. <br /> <br />Russell de Ville <br />12 April 2006 <br /> <br />
B000075BFK|5.0|Not 2pacs best ever but it would not be expected as this is originally material which didnt make the cut to earlier LP's such as all eyez on me and The 7 day theory. However saying that this still beats all competition hands down showing 2pac's true talent for song writing and delivery.<br /><br />All songs have been remixed and remastered to give a 2002 feel with a great mix of R n B, traditional hip hop and chilled acoustic beats (as heard on me and my girlfriend).<br /><br />This LP however is in danger of betraying what tupac stood for and becoming another sellout. This is seen with Nas , 2pac's sworn public enemy appearing on Thugz Mansion. It is rumoured that Nas and Pac were friends underneath the public persona, however Nas is put in the shade by Pac on this track. This underlines how unique 2pac was , as Nas is one of the best emcees around now, yet never comes close to replicating the passion that 2pac had.<br /><br />Not his greatest album, yet in comparision to others that year it is definatley in the top two perhaps just ahead of the eminem show. This echoes the fact that 2pacs legend will never die and shows that he is not just one of the greatest rap artsist that ever lived , but also one of the most infulencial people that ever lived; infulencing a generation to rise up against opression in society.
0385338686|4.0|I enjoy an occasional chick-lit book, and I've been hearing things about Kinsella's Shopaholic series for a while. So, when I saw this novel on the library shelf, I thought I'd give it a try. <br /> <br />The novel opens with Samantha Sweeting, a 29 year old British corporate lawyer, filling out a questionnaire to determine her stress level. It's obvious from the start that this likeable lady has her priority list of of whack, as does the rest of her family. On the eve of the meeting to determine whether she will become her firm's youngest partner, an encounter with her elderly, tounge-clucking neighbor foreshadows future events when the neighbor mutters how sad it is that Samantha can't even sew a missing button onto her shirt.  <br /> <br />Samantha, already high-strung, is even more so when she arrives at work the next day, anticipating what the decision will be regarding her partnership. To relax, she begins to clear mountains of paperwork off her desk. In so doing, she finds a month's-old memo saying that she was to file some paperwork.  With horror, Samantha realizes she's made a beginner's blunder.  The situation escalates when she discovers that this blunder can't be corrected and that she's lost a client 50 million pounds.  In shock, she flees the office and randomly hops on a train out of the city.  Lost and heartsick, wandering through some small town, she decides to ask for an aspirin and water at the next home.  In doing so, she is mistaken for a new housekeeper applicant and due to the \\"stronger than aspirin\\" medicine she is given, isn't thinking straight <br /> <br />Samantha decides to salvage her life and pretend that she really is a housekeeper, especially since she has become a laughingstock in the legal world. Predictable disasters occur with this can't-boil-water type. Thankfully, there is a hunky gardener, Nathaniel, whose mother teaches Samantha on the sly how to cook and clean. Predictable consequences follow with the handsome gardener.  <br/> <br />Just when Samantha is accustomed to her new life and really thriving, a discovery sets her head spinning and causes her to question what she wants out of life--the new or the old.  What is most important to her? <br /> <br />There is occasional swearing and mild sex (mentioned, not overtly explicit).  The scenes at times can seem a bit \\"movie-ish\\" (especially the ending). But, the characters are all very likeable.  The nouveau-rich employers, the gardener/pub owner/boyfriend, the crazy best friend who also happens to be titled, even the stern head lawyer at the firm all are nicely crafted and enjoyable to read about. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a light-hearted read which might make you think a bit about your own chaotic life, then this might be a nice evening's read for you.
078681859X|5.0|This is both a cracking good yarn and a very funny book. The character of chief interest is Bartimaeus, a highly intelligent demon or djinn with a devilish sense of humor. His human foil is a boy magician who, in addition to being a more somber figure, is not as believably portrayed. That's right, the demon is more believable than the human!<br /><br />In addition to being a really impressive book, and quite a fun read, this book is ostensibly part of a trilogy. That said, THE AMULET's storyline is self-contained and the tale can be enjoyed whether or not one commits to the other two books in the series.<br /><br />The book's structure is interestingly complex for a YA fantasy novel. Chapters alternate between Bartimaeus (as a first-person narrator) and Nathaniel (told in third-person.) And Bartimaeus is a shape-shifter and who often refers to his current incarnation in the third person!<br /><br />Add the fact that the book is extensively footnoted with Bartimaeus's observations, and you have a potentially confusing read... Yet, due to author Jonathan Stroud's considerable skills, none of the aforementioned does anything but ADD interest and layers to the tale! Thus, this book is equally appealing to younger and older readers.
1400032717|4.0|I finished reading an interesting book last night, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time by Mark Haddon.  What makes this novel unique is that the narrator is a teenage boy with autism and a gift for numbers and mathematics.  <br /> <br />The story begins when the narrator, Christopher John Francis Boone, discovers his neighbor's dog--dead--impaled with a pitchfork.  Christopher decides to investigate this mystery and turn it into a book.  But, this novel is not a detective tale. Instead, it is a view of the way an autistic person sees the world.  Subtle nuances of expression are foreign to him. Jokes are incomprehensible.  Imagination and pretend are forms of lying in Christopher's world.  We get to empathize and understand his thinking and appreciate his genius for numbers. <br /> <br />However, the book does not glorify this young man.   He curls into a ball and \\"does groaning\\" when things are stressful. He hides, wets himself sometimes, and performs complex mathematical equations in his head with equal emotion.  <br /> <br />The story does not linger on the death of the dog. It moves forward, giving us a slice of the life of Christopher Boone.  The terror with which he views ordinary events (like a handshake or a trip to the store) are neatly juxtaposed with the seeming dismissal of life-changing events (like the death of a parent).  <br /> <br />There is profanity in the novel. His father and people he encounters casually (policemen, people on the street) swear, but Christopher himself does not.  There are a number of English slang words that I didn't know.  What's a \\"skip\\"?  A stoop? An alley?  This novel would be appropriate for upper high school to adult readers.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I guess hollywood has got it figured out that if you slap the unrated label on a movie, it will sell more. These are labels that can be substituted for 'unrated': special edition, director's cut, or extended version. It doesn't really matter, they are all the same.Now it is time for me to get of my soapbox and talk abou the movie.<br />I had wanted to go see this movie because of the good reviews it was generating when it came out in theaters but I had to wait for it to come out on dvd. And it is indeed a good movie. I have never watched the exorcist before, so I cannot make any comparisons between the two movies except for the fact that they are both based on true stories. Also, even though it is not the scariest movie in the world, it did freak me out and made me jump alot. That is good because many of the recent PG-13 'horror' movies that I have seen aren't even remotely scary (with a few exceptions). Another thing I like about the movie is the fact that the writers, director, etc. didn't screw around with the spiritual side of it. I mean this: most movies that hollywood comes out with deal with the Bible (particulary movies that deal with the end of the times/antichrist) usually missenturpet scriptures, put in fictional stuff, or get politicaly correct. This movie doesn't do none of that. I'm not necesarily saying that the director and writer decided to make a Christian movie, but they did do good research and knowingly or not, they respected the Bible at least and didn't make a bunch of stuff up or mess up or get scriptures confused. I also like all the characters as well and feel like the actors did a good job protraying them. In fact, I believe that the prosecutor represents many Christians today: either they don't believe that satan and hell exist, or they belive that if they put head in the sand, the devil want notice them. I have a problem with chirstians who believe those things. First, if satan doesn't exsist, then eve would not have been decieved and Adam would never had chose to bite from the apple. The second is this, just because if we ignore satan, he is still going to give us hell. This might offened some people but it is true. I also like it when the priest (Tom wilkinson) says that we are in a spiritual battle and all. This is so true. One other thing, this movie does NOT try to push christianity upon anyone, in fact, it is open minded about the exorcism and lets you decide if Emily Rose is possesed by a demon(or devil) or not.<br />As for the scary side of things, this is pretty good. Don't get me wrong, this isn't the scariest movie out there but considering what else came out last year (the Ring 2, The Skeleton Key, Venom, etc.) this is above and beyond all them. The special features are all right but considering that this is supposed to be 'unrated', it is somewhat lacking. I could care less for porn and loads of gore which is \\"violent porn\\" as Tom Servo puts in his review of the original Texas Chainsaw Masacre. But I would have liked to have seen more indepth making ofs or other similar things. Oh well. If you want to see a good horror movie, than get this. You won't be dissapointed, unless you think that the only good kind of horror movie has to have bucket loads of gore and blood and senseless sex and nudity.ould never had chose to bite from the apple.

B0002EXH4K|5.0|Countdown To Extinction (1992.), Megadeth's fifth studio album<br /><br />The story of Dave Mustaine and his world famous thrash metal band Megadeth is one never short of interest. During the 1980's, Megadeth never quite found true consistency. Dave Mustaine, out to make music to rival his old band Metallica, was plagued by band line-up troubles. If it wasn't him firing band member's such as Chris Poland for selling band equipment for drug money, then it was Dave himself abusing drink and drugs like it was the last day of his life. As a result, the early Megadeth lacked any sense of chemistry and this reflected in the band's music which, although it was pretty cool and great to listen to, did not quite have the classic touch. This all changed with the recruitment of drummer Nick Menza and guitar genius Marty Friedman. With the new line-up in place, the band recorded the classic that is 'Rust In Peace', one of my personal favourite albums of all time. Following a hugely successful tour, there was no doubt that Megadeth had discovered their greatness. Following the tour, Dave Mustaine and Co. went into the studio to make the follow-up album, 1992's 'Countdown To Extinction'.<br /><br />At the time it would have seemed impossible to top an album like 'Rust In Peace'. So many bands make a great/classic album and then follow it up with a flop. Well this was certainly not the case with Megadeth. OK, in my opinion they don't top 'Rust In Peace' with this album but they still produced another definite 5* effort. 'Countdown To Extinction' is an amazing achievement. With this album, we see Megadeth beginning to depart from the thrash stylings of their earlier albums. This is mostly in the speed of most of the songs; the album is slower throughout. However, the riffs are on the whole heavy and at times bone-crunching, the great guitar solos are still there and the recording is undeniably vintage Megadeth. In many ways this is the band's response to Metallica's self-titled, released a year earlier in 1991. I'm not the world's biggest fan of the Black Album. I know all band's have to develop, but with Metallica, their sound was noticably more safe on the Black Album, with less inventive solos, unimaginative lyrics and sometimes sloppy and repetitive slower riffs. However, with Megadeth's development with 'Countdown To Extinction', none of these problems occur. The band develop their sound and become maybe more commercial but at the same time loose none of their bite. Dave Mustaine still writes awesome lyrics which raise various social/world issues and still puts together really inventive and cool riffs. The solos on the album are great, especially Marty Friedman's efforts. Finally as well, Megadeth have a great sense of humour in their music too and this can be seen in some of the funny voice over sequences during the album (more about that later). 'Countdown To Extinction' was a big success for the band, hitting No.2 in the album charts - it's the album Dave Mustaine has been trying to beat ever since. That's how good an album this is!<br /><br />Following Megadeth's re-union in 2004 with the release of 'The System Has Failed', Dave Mustaine personally helped remaster the band's back catalogue. With 'Countdown To Extinction', the remaster is excellent. All of the guitar lines shine through the remaster, the drums are crisp sounding and the bass is ever present. Mustaine's vocals also sound great. The remaster of the album also has a great track in the 'Crown Of Worms' out-take and demos for 'Countdown To Extinction', 'Symphony Of Destruction' and 'Psychotron'. A great remaster version to get hold of.<br /><br />So what about the 11 tracks on the album? 'Countdown' gets underway with hard hitting opener 'Skin O' My Teeth'. This song, with a contemplation of suicide theme, has some pretty fast riffs and assured Mustaine vocals. Friedman serves up a great solo during the course of the song. Following this is a true Megadeth classic in 'Symphony Of Destruction'. A deceptive orchestral opening builds into a slower, chugging but phemoninal metal song. A catchy riff and growling Mustaine vocal sets the tone of the song. The chorus is great and Friedman plays yet again another great solo. 'Architecture Of Aggression' follows. Gun fire opens the song before a great pacy metal riff kicks in. A great song with Mustaine raising lyrical issues questioning military tactics. 'Foreclosure Of A Dream' is next up, a song looking at political failings. The song has a hard, resonating chorus. The slower verses with softer guitar are good contrasts. One of Megadeth's most famed songs, 'Sweating Bullets' rolls in next. This is a great but also really funny song. Dave Mustaine does some amusing narrative voice overs in the verse. Musically the song is quite simple but it's very effective. The soloing in the middle of the song is pretty captivating.<br /><br />'This Was My Life' is an underrated track. The song has a quite echoey chorus and some stunning punchy metal riffs. The title track is next, ironically this is probably the weakest track on the album. Lyrically the song is very effective, with some powerful lyrics about the extinction of endangered species. However musically the song never quite gets going, with only the flurried chorus a highlight in that respect. Still, not a bad track. Nevertheless, things pick up again with 'High Speed Dirt', with more great riffs and some blazing solos from Friedman and a catchy acoustic guitar fill, before a great 'High Speed Dirt!' chorus. 'Psychotron' is next, another highlight of the album filled with gritty riffs and catchy solo fills. Theres more amusement, with some funny voice overs in 'Captive Honour', a song which looks at crime and it's consequences. In many ways this is a much improved version of '502' from the 'So Far, So Good...So What!' album. Then though, we have the best saved till last with 'Ashes In Your Mouth'. This song, which looks at the aftermath of war, is my personal favourite track on the album. It's a criminally underrated song which has an awesome opening sequence and a great accelerated chorus, with a distorted 'God Have Mercy!' Mustaine vocal. The song is brilliant right through it's 6 minute run time. A cool drum solo followed by pounding chords finish off what is a classic Megadeth album.<br /><br />So there you have it, another essential album in the Megadeth discography. Dave Mustaine and his band may have slowed things down a bit and lost some of their thrash stylings, but this album more than makes up for it in very well crafted songwriting, powerful lyrics and catchiness/humour. 'Countdown To Extinction' is another chapter in the development of Megadeth and captures the classic line-up of the band at the top of their game. 'Countdown' is a must for any Megadeth fan and for any metal/rock fan in general. Even if your not really into thrash bands, you will be sure to find a lot of common ground with this great album.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9/10orchestral opening builds into a slower, chugging but phemoninal metal song.

I love this album so much, it does three things for me. It put's me in the mood, It makes me slow down in whatever I'm doing, and it's what I listen to when I would want to go to sleep. Because the girl can sing but it's so soft I cant help but just sleep, and it relaxes me so much. The best songs are: Smooth opperater  Sweetest Taboo, Is it a crime, Paradise, No ordinary love, and Kiss of life
B000EGCITG|5.0|P!nk has outdone herself yet again!  This fantastic album represents how eclectic P!nk really is.  From fun songs with stomping beats like 'Cuz I Can' to the beautiful, and almost haunting 'Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self' this album covers every area of the spectrum.  Stand out tracks include, 'Dear Mr. President', 'I'm Not Dead', 'Runaway', 'I Got Money Now,' and 'Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self', but these will soon change since every song is fantastic.  If you love good music that is filled with passion, get this CD - you won't be disappointed!
B00082IJ08|5.0|I purchased this CD in the midst of a several-month long bender where I would purchase all of my music from an online music store instead of physical media.  Usually this saves money.  Oddly enough, this CD was more expensive in digital format than in physical form.  As for the music, what can I say that hasn't already been said?  This is a wide variety of styles and lyrics, and the songs range from fun to outstanding.  I didn't really care much for their previous effort, I assume that danger mouse's influence elevates this work.  I imagine that at least one or two tracks on this CD will please fans of most genres of music.  Even without the full animated online experiences, this band is really exciting.  It's rare that a gimmick artist has great music, but that is exactly the case here.
B00005NIL9|5.0|1970's Fire and Water was Free's third album, and the one which made them international stars.  They were featured at the Isle of Wight Festival that year; the liner notes to this CD tell of how Pete Townshend approached the group on the ferry over to the Isle of Wight and congratulated them on the success of \\"All Right Now.\\"<br /><br />And they certainly deserved it--on Fire and Water, Free are hitting on all cylinders for sure.  This was the best thing Paul Rodgers ever did, bar none; closest match might be Bad Company's eponymous 1974 debut.  Paul Kossoff's guitar playing shows just why Eric Clapton wanted to learn how to get the kind of vibrato Kossoff was getting out of his Les Paul (which totally floored Kossoff--hadn't everyone been saying, just a few years previously, \\"Clapton is God\\"?  Talk about affirmation!).  Andy Fraser and Simon Kirke make up one of the most solid rhythm sections in the history of rock 'n' roll.  And the songs?  And how!<br /><br />The title cut absolutely smokes--'nuff said.  \\"All Right Now\\" was a hit, and deservedly so; 36 years later, this bluesy tale of picking up a girl and trying to hit on her still rocks.  \\"Oh I Wept\\" has enough soul to have done Otis Redding proud.  The bonus tracks are nice, if not terribly essential.  The remastering is crystal clear and very warm.  The only question I have is this:  Why has Island's UK office been the only one to step up to the plate?  A&M was the band's US label (not to mention the US label of several other Island artists, such as Fairport Convention), and apart from the Molten Gold 2 CD anthology from 1993, they haven't bothered.  Thank all the gods of rock 'n' roll somebody did; kudos to Island.
0553801503|3.0|Just a few things to add to the previous reviews: It's odd how almost all the real action in this volume--the taking of castles, the Blackfish's escape, Loras Tyrell's heroic attack, Arya's murder of the singer, and so forth--is related second-hand. Instead, we get to watch Cersei in her boudoir and Brienne wander around aimlessly. <br /> <br />Also, it's not clear why the author still feels compelled to introduce new characters--Arianne of Dorne, for instance--when all the old wonderful ones don't have enough to do. A strange piece of work, this book, but somehow still compelling.
B000002U94|5.0|I've seen Bob Seger in concert several times in the 1980s and I was always blown away by how close the band sounded to their studio albums.  The first time I saw them (at the Toledo Speedway Jam in '83), I was sure they were lipsynching for the first couple of songs (they started with \\"Even Now\\" from his latest at the time, THE DISTANCE).<br /><br />By the way, shouldn't there be a third live double-album of the period after NINE TONIGHT?  (I saw him do a song called \\"Yesterday Rules\\" in '86 that's never been released).<br /><br />Anyway, NINE TONIGHT is still one of my all-time favorite live albums (now CDs) of any artist from any time.  I actually prefer the live version of \\"Fire Lake\\" better than the studio take.  Great American Rock from one of the most underappreciated rockers (at least he's finally in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!).<br /><br />Rock and Roll that's never been forgotten.
B00062IDCO|2.0|I generally consider myself a Star Trek fan, but I've never gotten into Voyager, only watching the occasional episode here and there.  Thanks to a friend, I got the opportunity to catch season 7, but the result was yet another round of missed opportunities for the Trek series that boasted such an enticing premise.  Compared to the seventh seasons of TNG (4.5/5) and DS9 (4/5), this is definitely lagging quite a few steps behind.  That said, few of the episodes were outright terrible, as most were just mediocre, and there were a number of fairly enjoyable episodes as well.    If Voyager is ultimately a TNG clone with a few minor twists, it comes up far short of its predecessor thanks to its mediocre cast and bland storytelling.  DS9 and Enterprise weren't perfect, but at least they delivered lengthy, epic story arcs that gave us tension, intrigue, moral quandaries, and cool space battles.    Unimatrix Zero, Part II- C, not without some cool action and f/x, but ultimately drags too much when focusing on 7 of 9 and her romance.    Imperfection- D, not being a Seven fan, I can't say I found this episode to be very entertaining.    Drive- B-, not that bad, given that Paris and Torres make for a decent couple.  The race had its moments of humor.    Repression- C+, starts out intriguing, but loses its momentum towards the end.    Critical Care- C-, a subpar episode focusing on the holographic doctor.      Nightingale- B-, pretty interesting to see Harry Kim take command, even if the episode doesn't really do anything outstanding.    Flesh and Blood- B-, delivers some good tension and excitement, though it suffers a bit when focusing on the Doctor and his interaction with the other holograms.    Shattered- B, probably the season's best episode, even if the premise comes across a bit gimmicky.  It's cool to see how Janeway and Chakotay interact given the situation.    Lineage- C, Torres' back story makes for some rather weak drama.  Repentance- D, had the potential for strongdrama, but comes across too bland and predictable.    Prophecy- B, a rather amusing episode thanks to the presence of an entire crew of Klingons.  There's some solid laughs and a bit of action towards the end.    The Void- B, this episode does a pretty convincing job of creating a dire situation, though I think it would have been more dramatically effective if Janeway had violated the prime directive in this instance.    Workforce- C-, rips off an already mediocre Stargate SG-1 episode.    Q2- C-, not without its share of laughs thanks to the presence of Q, but his son is unbearably annoying and badly acted.    Author, Author- B, an absolutely hilarious first half thanks to the Doctor's supremely silly holodeck novel gives way to a limp courtroom drama that was done better in TNG's The Measure of a Man.    Friendship One- C+    Natural Law- D    Renaissance Man- C-, loved the Doctor's \\"deathbed\\" confession, but little else about this episode works.    Endgame- C, the time travel premise seems like a cheap cop-out (and all the more frustrating when you recall the point the crew had made about not changing time back in Season 1's Eye of the Needle). There's some cool action against the Borg, but not enough to really send this series out with a bang.
B0000BHZOB|5.0|When they put out \\"Bookends,\\" Simon & Garfunkle provided evidence that they were trying to move up to the next level from the pleasing folk-rock duets such as \\"Scarborough Fair\\" upon which they had made their reputation. But even the growth shown in that album could hardly prepare listeners to the quantum leap forward represented by \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\" You listen to the title song and you just think that Art Garfunkle had been waiting his entire life to sing this song (I know that Garfunkle always maintained that Simon should have sung the song, but I will never ever want to live in that alternative reality). The opening piano part and the crescendo strings at the end could have been ostentatious, but instead the result is the greatest final \\"chord\\" this side of \\"A Day in the Life,\\" which is pretty heady company, boys and girls. I might never work out the entire list, but I have no doubt that \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is one of the ten most beautiful \\"pop\\" songs of all-time.<br /><br />But what makes this album great is that the title track is not the only epic song: What would we be thinking of \\"The Boxer\\" if it was not overshadowed by \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\"? Then you throw into the mix the simple elegance of \\"So Long Frank Lloyd Wright,\\" the synoptic fun of \\"Cecilia,\\" and the poignancy of \\"The Only Living Boy in New York\\" and the emotional palette of the album is as broad as you could ever want. The live cover of \\"Bye Bye Love\\" reminds us of the duo's roots while \\"El Condor Passa\\" hints at what was to come with Paul Simon's interest in third world music.  There are a pair of bonus tracks on this Japanese reissued CD.  Listening to Simon & Garfunkle sing in French for \\"Feuilles-O\\" is okay, and the semi-stripped down demo version of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is of some interest, but neither bonus track is a major addition and you might want to program your CD player to skip them after the first time around so the album can end with \\"Song for the Asking\\" as was intended.<br /><br />Yes, I was stunned that Simon & Garfunkle broke up after this album, but then when you win six Grammys maybe there is no place left to go but down and you should just quit while you are ahead (or in this case, way, way ahead). You can look at what the pair have done separately in the decades since then and even Simon's \\"Graceland\\" album or Garfunkle singing \\"All I Know\\" still fall short. You can get Simon & Garfunkle's greatest hits collection and get all of the early stuff you want, but as far as I am concerned you need to have their last two albums in their entirety in your music library.the Asking\\" as was intended. <br /> <br />Yes, I was stunned that Simon & Garfunkle broke up after this album, but then when you win six Grammys maybe there is no place left to go but down and you should just quit while you are ahead (or in this case, way, way ahead).

B000EHQ8AU|5.0|Well i bought this album recently and i must say i find it rather impressive. I own all placebo's albums and whilst isn't as good as 'without you im nothing' or 'placebo' it is far far better than 'sleeping with ghosts'. I like the way it incorporates all placebo's talents which have been seen in earlier albums. Having said that, although musically the album is different - slower - there is still the classic twisted, yet relatable placebo lyrics. Best songs on album: follow the cops back home, blind, pierrot the clown, and infra red. Would reccomend anyone to give this album a try even if you dont like it at first, it will definitley grow on you! <br />If you are new to the placebo world, i would try buying an older album first so you can see what the real placebo is like before buyin this one. The best album by far is 'without you im nothing'&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;GET THIS ALBUM BEFORE YOU BUY 'MEDS'!
B000E97Y6K|5.0|The Twin Pack is a Good buy, but personally I would have been happier with a film plus commentary. However, the extras on disc 2 are really only of interest if you want to destroy the view you might have of the film. The new film differs from the 1933 original in at least 4 major points.  The film itself is stunning, a major feat of film making prowess. But if you don't want to know how the magic tricks are done ( to make the film) and to what degree the CGI and  WETA have  created the end product then do NOT get the two disc version. The info on disc two has about 4 minutes of material which would interest  current fans, and the rest is going to be great in 20-30  years as historical/-hysterical material. However, the sight of the original King Kong \\"Puppet\\"  skeleton ( no skin) might be worth it.  If you want a great film, then just buy  the one disc version, its cheaper, and its just as fun.
B000EYK4KI|1.0|I HATE IT when studios call their Double Dip attempt an \\"Unrated\\" cut. If you are calling a movie unrated, it should be because you replaced things you cut that had to be cut to make a certain rating. If the rating didnt change, then you shouldnt use \\"Unrated\\". They are killing that term. It used to mean something, now it just means \\"Buy this other version for 4 more dollars\\".
B0002B15XI|2.0|Although completely devoid of a plot, M*A*S*H nevertheless gives us a penetrating insight into the workings of military medicine in the 4077.  What we're meant to discover is that war is hell.  Point made. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, that point has been better made countless times before and since.  The fresh viewpoint that Hawkeye, Trapper John, and Duke really give us is into the empty soul of the 60's counter culture, a me-first attitude that rejects traditional morality and ridicules authority.  They seem to have no goals beyond the desire for immediate self-gratification and \\"sticking it to the man\\".  It's a depressing look at depressing people. <br /> <br />Still, the film chugs along, delivering a laugh or two here and there until the last half-hour degenerates into an amateur football game film, which was done better by \\"The Longest Yard\\".  When you realize that Donald Southerland has been out-acted by Burt Reynolds, you might as well turn off the tube. <br /> <br />I'd recommend watching it for the cultural relevance, but as entertainment it doesn't deliver.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I just watched Brokeback Mountain, I liked it but I dont think I loved it. It had parts that flowed smoothly but other parts of the story line seemed to be missing something. Maybe alittle more emotion, tenderness, or connecting with the viewer. I have many friends who are homosexual, bi-sexual and straight. One of my closet friends who is homosexual really liked it. I think when his wife  called him out, maybe more of a story line. And the death of his partner. Plus, didn't he have 3 children in the beginning of the story then towards the middle to the end of the story you only see 1 daughter. Do I think everyone should see this movie, YES, but I think while watching it each person will get his/her own concept of the movie.
B000002GEY|5.0|Review no.82.An absolute must-have 1979 Supertramp classic.I mean,I've never been THAT huge of a Supertramp fan,but I've always totally dug each and every tune on this CD reissue.Tracks that no true fan of '70's album rock should never grow tired of include the lp's three top ten smash hits \\"The Logical Song\\",\\"Take The Long Way Home\\" and \\"Goodbye Stranger\\".I,myself have always especially enjoyed hearing the title cut \\"Breakfast In America\\" and \\"Lord Is It Mine\\" too.This is without a doubt an outstanding record,from every stand point.
B000EGCITG|5.0|This is an awesome album. Was getting tired of the imitation punk girls...getting tired of Kelly Clarkson...Avril lavigne...finally someone that sounds credible singing the way she does...Pink acts and sounds just how her music portrays her...kick a$$. Love \\"Cuz I Can\\"
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I kept hearing \\"It's Like That\\" over the PA at various public places - the gym, the mall etc.  I had no idea it was Mariah Carey.      This album exudes confidence and style.  Shake it Off is my favorite track, and the bonus DVD includes 4 full length music videos.  Much better value than most DualDisc offerings which often include only boring filler on the DVD side.    Based on the strength of this release, I went out and got \\"The Remixes\\" CD as well.
6305897786|4.0|FYI:  For those reviewers that want us to use a spellchecker, Amazon.com doesn't provide that luxury I'm afraid.  So, if a word or two is misspelled, our apologies.   <br />FYI Part 2: If you have read \\"The DaVinci Code\\", then perhaps your choice as Robert Langdon would have been Depp, due to his role in this movie.  I thought so anyways. <br /> <br />The acting is on par with a movie such as this.  It's hard to define this as a \\"new\\" classic or something TCM is going to be airing alongside \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" as a Thriller Mini-Thon.  However, from the opening sequence to the subject matter, it does a relatively good job at addressing a book in which \\"Satan himself\\" authored.   <br /> <br />Frank Langella had a ton of acting chops back in the late 70s, but with this being the only possible exception, he seems to rather be stuck in typecast roles.  Another good actor that apparently prefers this is the underrated, and highly underused Hector Elizondo.  Frank plays Depp's \\"employer\\" only in the financial sense.  He gets Depp to check on the validity of two other copies of the same book in the hopes he (Langella) has the authentic version.   <br /> <br />Extensive knowledge of the occult, the devil, or the actual meanings of Lucifer is not needed to have a good time with this movie.  Considering most movies that are made from novels don't necessarily market themselves to the literary students and historians around the world, it's hard to imagine needing to bone up on the topic before viewing.  Suspension of disbelief is something every movie needs viewers to do...otherwise, wouldn't \\"A Christmas Carol\\" or even \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" be considered drivel? <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this movie with a bag or two of popcorn and some sodas during a recent Saturday night.  It's a gripping tale of the lengths people go to obtain certain artifacts.  And isn't the thought of evil watching you something that people typically enjoy?
B00000K3UU|5.0|The review from \\"The New Yorker\\" on this page is probably one of the most pompous and hollow reviews I've ever read. \\"Big Daddy\\" is a great movie.  I'm a long-time Adam Sandler fan but, put it this way, after seeing this movie, so is my mother. She's usually not into this kind of comedy, but this has become one of her all-time favorite movies.  So, saying that \\"Anyone looking to solve the mystery of Adam Sandler's mass appeal is not going to do it here\\" seems to be a ridiculous statement. <br /> <br />The movie is funny from \\"all angles\\".  The story is good, the cast is as solid as I've ever seen in a comedy, etc, etc... Whether or not you're usually into Sandler's brand of comedy, you will most likely appreciate this film. I feel that this is Adam Sandler at his best - and it is certainly one of his most successful projects. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00062RCBW|3.0|The Bad <br />======= <br />- Video Quality. <br />I would have expected the producers of the DVD sets to take the original film and produce at least DVD quality. It appears (so far) to be television quality. Although I would have preferred the 16:9 aspect ratio, I knew I was getting 4:3 prior to purchasing. <br /> <br />- Shipping Packaging. <br />I am a bit on the perfectionist side of things, especially when I'm talking about hundreds of dollars (hey, some people don't have to think twice, but that isn't me, LOL). The \\"carton\\" with the faces of the main characters that holds each DVD set (see graphic) was not \\"new\\" quality, in that there were slight tears which I reinforced with clear shipping tape. I can only assume this came from shipment and not the warehouse. Also, the box was much bigger than the product itself, yielding about 6 inches of wiggle room on each side, with no packaging whatsoever to keep it from moving around within the shipping box. <br /> <br />- Box Set Packaging <br />Again being a perfectionist I did immediately notice the \\"bumps\\" and \\"pokes\\" in the boxed sets. Some of the silver covers do not set right. It just seems that there are indications of \\"wear\\" on them. A few of the inner casing that holds the DVDs have impurities on them as well, like white spots. <br /> <br />The Good <br />======== <br />- Delivery Time <br />Using the complimentary Amazon Prime subscription, I indeed got this within a day using next day shipping. <br /> <br />- DVD Condition <br />Although the boxed set packaging left much to be desired, the physical DVDs were all in tact and if they were used I couldn't tell, they all look brand spanking new without any scratches, dents, or rivets. <br /> <br />- Its Star Trek <br />Enough said. ;)
B00005JL78|5.0|[War-Crime Revisionist Perversion Films Marvelously]<br /><br />One of the best science fiction in years, quality special effects, acting, sets, transition and action choreography. Still, nothing will ever top `Blade Runner'.  That was also a crime detective story, set in a more surrealistic future accentuating the nighttime urban metropolis, altogether a different story than one involving the psychic detection of violent murders before they occur. Is there really such a thing as precognition, or is the phenomena much stranger, because you know, the same paradox plagues time travel going backward or forward and it is only corrected through the steady progression of time; which for all we know will continue indefinitely.  In other words, the future from any past has to have happened...naturally...in order for the paradox to be avoided.  It would be paradoxical with respect to our time, for time travelers to have moved from any time ahead of us to an earlier time ahead of us on through to times behind us.  The other thing is, if anything did move through time it would be quantum information, just like those graphic foreshadowing precognitions only the information would be imbedded so as to metaphorically semaphore a plausible symbol mapping preserving zero knowledge protocol.  It's the idea that some dreams are strange, so you search through your memory for reasons or event that may have triggered them; and then something that hadn't yet happened seems to align uncannily in the symbol decryption, as if it was the cause of that dream, long after you'd had the dream.  There's just no way to know for sure; however it will seem improbably steganographic given the random variables.  Is it logical for now to posit our own stead as being past, relative to another time ahead, the same way we look at the past and can identify similar relative positions? Perhaps it would require a technology to capture that edge out in front of us, even as bizarre as the networking of precogs floating in a sensitivity deprivation environment.<br /><br />I liked the realism of this film, real in how it has a built-in purging mechanism that would flush the precogs into a reservoir.  Now what event would motivate that erasure of record?  Probably high crimes of state.  There's more than enough rumor to suggest this sort of thing's been implemented for some time now.  Secret facilities, human experiments, government remote viewing programs, psychotronics, even the absence of artificial intelligence.  I think it would be far more likely some kind of game is being played on human populations with real weapons systems, used to wreak havoc and conduct torture on them arbitrarily; as a form of reprisal, a political infliction on incorrectness of conformity, or even to fabricate the framing of crimes on blacklisted state suspects, a way to brainwash a confession into them.  If this were happening, what signs might we see of it on the surface in the news, events of the day?  There would be a roguish, no account effort to pass torture off on the American people like that was just standard military operating procedure.  And it would keep peddling its public offering in post releases of more of the same.  Dissent would become targeted for the language of suspect mental health infirmity, any questioning or criticizing of the news propaganda.  The public may or may not, (seeing as this is a difficult question to resolve), have been struck with what is called an `exotic weapon of mass destruction', one that is virtually untraceable, one that attacks the psychic pre-consciousness on the boundaries of sleep; and it may have been too painful and strange for anyone to feel comfortable talking about.  Imagine that for a form of totalitarian state crack-down.  Nobody wants to be called `crazy' or mentally ill--it's just like warning the prisoners not to confer with each other something is wrong, that they were attacked with an energy in their mind that hurt them.  I guess thereis no need to ask under what conditions such an infliction of mind control would be found most desperately needed as a population control measure.<br /><br />There might even be a secretive, weird religion with all sorts of interesting claims about `memory engrams', it might even be a cell of government intelligence community public relations offshoot.  And it would drive at convincing the public they were irrational, impulsively violent, cruel, and basically without control over their tempers.  It would have access to a lot of government developed and spy agency utilized memory affecting drugs, compounds etc.  Sodium pentothal, who knows?  People would have to be hypnotically regressed to get them `clear', or possibly to program them with all kinds of crazy ideas or paramilitary agenda.<br /><br />Pre-crime is a most interesting judicial concept.  But be careful, you know with today's computer animation and wherever the government's huge A.I. efforts were absconded, and if they had the ability to tap into the publics' minds, group or individual, they might make up any number of kangaroo protocols for their kangaroo FISA kinds of courts that all went down in complete secrecy, sealed record or no record.  They would simply place you in your dream, with the weapon and the victim, and run the movie from both ends:  the puppet string forcing function, and the measurement gathering the state's evidence.  Hypnotic regression is used for trial evidence, for cases involving traumatic, early childhood victim memory reconstruction.  There is a protective mechanism that helps the mind to block early developmental traumas.  Maybe the idea of pre-crime ought to be associated with crimes in human memory yet to have been unlocked by psychic science.  That would seem more on the level.  That and the earlier idea mentioned about how berserk crimes might be part of a behavioral conditioning program--so many suicide bombers, so many freak atrocities just in America in recent years.  Have millions of Americans blocked the memory of traumatic sleep suffocation struggle while in natural deep sleep paralysis (the brainstem's idling)?

B000AP04FG|4.0|If you can get through the rather tedious first half hour or so, Mr. and Mrs. Smith finds its legs and makes for plenty of entertaining action and adventure.  That first half hour can be pretty rough, though, as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie really seem to sleepwalk through their roles.  Doubtlessly, this is due in no small part to the nature of their characters, two highly-ranked assassins going through the motions of a normal husband and wife in order to hide their real jobs from one another.  I think it goes deeper than the script, though.  Jolie has always gone all out for her characters, but for quite a while I just didn't think she put her heart into this particular role - ironic, given the fact that she and Pitt began their little love affair during filming.  I have to admit that the whole real-life romantic triangle thing dampened my enjoyment of the film, to a certain degree.  For me, there's a definite ick factor in watching Mr. and Mrs. Smith, since in a sense you're watching a real-life adulterous affair play out right in front of your eyes.<br /><br />The plot is pretty basic and nothing we haven't seen before.  Girl meets boy, girl marries boy, girl and boy try to kill each other.  For the first six years of their marriage, John Smith (Pitt) and his lovely wife Jane (Jolie) are completely unaware that their partner is, like themselves, a high-level assassin.  How they go traipsing all over the world killing people and still manage to return in time for 7:00 dinner every night is just one of many questions the writer chose to blissfully ignore.  They really have little reason to suspect one another, though, because their suburban home lifestyle is exceedingly boring.  Whatever spark of romance they once shared, it's long gone by this point.  Everything changes, however, when they get in each other's way on separate missions centered on the same target.  Neither can afford to let the other blow his/her cover, so their respective agencies quickly pit them against one another.  Of course, things get a little more involved after that, but you can see where this whole thing is going.  Finally, once the Smiths stop being so painfully civil to one another, their characters finally begin to show signs of life.  Too many attempts to be funny during the heat of battle only reinforces the weakness of the entire script, however, leaving you unable to enjoy all of the mayhem and things that go boom as much as you think you should.  Sure, some of the dialogue is funny, but most of the time it just seems terribly contrived.<br /><br />With all of its explosions, big guns, and all-around violence, Mr. and Mrs. Smith should manage to satisfy those who just can't get enough movie mayhem, and Angelina Jolie - even though she's not at her best here - still makes any movie she's in worth watching.  Clearly, though, something is just missing here.  Thanks largely to a relatively weak script, Pitt and Jolie never really bring you in to their characters' world, which means you are never able to forget that you're watching a movie.  As a result, the film entertains but never really satisfies.  It's really a 3.5 star movie; I rounded my rating up to four stars because, despite its many weaknesses, the film did manage to entertain me.m against one another.

630529142X|4.0|I would call this a typical Sandler movie.  It's probably not his best movie, but it definitely has its moments, with a good number of quotable lines.    Henry Winkler is hilarious as the cowardly Coach Klein.  I mean, the scene where he's watching video of a past game, gets an idea for a new play and nearly passes out is probably one of the funniest moments in the movie. His Roy Orbison tattoo speech and his \\"Gatorade is better than water\\" taunt are also standout scenes.      Sandler delivers another great \\"idiot comedy\\" performance as Bobby Boucher. The mixture of love and fear he feels for his overbearing momma has him torn between his loyalty to her and his new-found love for football and a certain girl. Boucher's fascination with cold, pure water is pretty funny in and of itself.     The story is pretty well written and there are enough laughs to put this movie up there among Sandler's best work. If you are a fan of Adam Sandler's brand of comedy (or SNL comedy in general), I would recommend this movie.
B0006PV5VC|4.0|Rimsky-Korsakov's kaleidoscopic sea adventure \\"Scheherazade\\" is one piece of classical music that, more than most others, screams for the highest level of sonic production. The classic Reiner-Chicago Symphony version gets it in this SACD treatment. The sound is more vivid here than I can ever recall with great clarity exposing orchestral details -- the snare drum in the third movement and coincidental timpani and cimbal beats in the finale -- never before so apparent in the recording.<br /><br />This SACD, unlike some other re-releases of RCA classic performances, plays in three channels. I like all this and it sounded wonderful in my living room. I was somewhat disappointed with violins coming from the center right channel, a position opposite of their setting in orchestral format. Still this is an update of a classic performance of the music that is still considered by some critics the benchmark in this music.<br /><br />The makeweight Stravinksy piece is a delightful 22 minute excursion into that composer's fine mind. Hearing that music for the first time on this recording, I made a quick link between this and the film music of Bernard Herrmann in the way  both composers used portamento strings for effect, as opposed to musical value.<br /><br />Having said this, I still think the best version of Rimsky-Korsakov's wonderful music goes to either of the modern recordings led by Leopold Stokowski, a conductor with far more imagination and influence on musicians than the stern and hard-driving Reiner, who was often hated while respected by his players.<br /><br />Stokowski's two modern stereo versions -- on the Decca/London label with the London Symphony and on BMG/RCA with the Royal Philharmonic -- are both superior readings, in my opinion. Stoki leads a more leisurely and luxuriant adventure than Reiner, a noted literalist with great projection. While Reiner focuesd on orchestral detail, precision playing and generating excitement in big moments, I think Stokowski's renderings are more in tune with the romantic nature of this wonderful music.<br /><br />Stoki's Decca/London reading was re-released a few years back to much critical accalim. I believe the BMG/RCA recording is a more \\"Russian\\" rendering of the music. Both recordings are in manufactured sound, meaning the recordings were made with many microphones and mixed by the conductor and technicians to present a personalized Stokowski sound that may or may not reflect reality. In this respect, the Reiner recording is far more honest.<br /><br />Whether or not the Reiner-Chicago rendering is your favorite or one you've never sampled, there can be no question this is a classic performance that sounds better than ever in its current dressing.th the romantic nature of this wonderful music.

0671004107|3.0|Contact, by Carl Sagan, is overall a mediocre book.  There are three parts in the novel.  The first part, The Message, is mostly about Ellie, the main character's childhood and background.  This is a very boring part in the book.  It is basically a biography of Ellie.  There is not really any reason for me to care.  There is no action or suspense.  There are no interesting concepts that would intrigue a reader.  In fact, there is little science fiction in this part of the book.  The only aspect of science fiction prevalent in part one of the novel is the fears, hopes and dreams of Ellie Arroway.  That sounds interesting, doesn't it? <br /> The second part, The Machine, is mostly about the interpretation of the Message.  Also this part includes the building of the machine.  In this section of the book, it is still very boring.  There is a pattern for the chapters in part two.  The beginning of the chapter starts with an uninteresting concept or theme in math or science.  The middle of the chapter expands on the concept or theme.  The beginning and middle of the chapters are dull because of this.  The only exciting parts in the chapters occur at the end.  They introduce new interesting concepts.  One example is the introduction of the idea of the Trojan horse theory.  Someone suggests that the machine they are building is a way for the aliens to voyage to earth easily.  The problem is that they do not expand on the concepts that I, the reader am interested in.  Instead they waste most of each chapter on uninteresting dull concepts that my chemistry teacher would find boring. <br /> The third part, The Galaxy, is a very interesting part in the book.  I could hardly put the book down.  The main reason I liked the third part of the book was the abundance of science fiction.  In this part of the book, Ellie and some other scientists are using the machine to travel to Vega.  This part of the book deals with technology and perceptions of reality.  In the third part of the book, they throw out many new concepts.  One example is the \\"space subway\\".  The machine that they build allows the people to travel to the center of the galaxy by using a galactic subway.  The third part in the book introduces a lot of cool concepts like that.  The main reason the third part was the best is because of all the action.  There is not much action in the first two parts.  In the third, the scientists travel to the center of the Galaxy and also have to prove to everyone that they are not lying.  Perceptions of reality play a big role in the third part.  People on earth do not believe the Scientists, because the voyage seems to only take the scientists 20 minutes.  To the scientists, their adventure takes a day and 20 minutes.  The third part of the book was fun to read.  <br /> Overall, I think it is an okay book.  It could have been better if the author had further developed the concepts that I found interesting. <br />

0140284087|5.0|P G Wodehouse specializes in extremely humorous, complex plots, with everyone seemingly at cross purposes, and the ubiquitous happy ending. His characters are the offspring of the builders of the British Empire, wastrels all.  Bertie is an extremely affable chap, but a bit lacking in brain power. In the opening story Jeeves becomes Bertie's butler, definitely the brains of the duo.  Bertie is one of natures bachelors, but this never prevents him from being engaged to completely unsuitable fiances.  They generally have terrific profiles, volatile temperments, and consider Bertie to be a spineless jellyfish with brains to match; and attempt to mold him.  The brainy literature they force on poor Bertie is way beyond our heroes reading level. Bertie leads an idyllic life, the sun is in the sky, the birds are singing in the trees, but he manages to always land himself in the soup.  The magnificent Jeeves is ever there to fish him out, not unlike the magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.  Jeeves's mental prowess is always made available to come to the aid of Bertie's menagerie of pals. <br /> <br />
B0000021RG|5.0|I know there are lot of you who have issues involving the original mix/master of this 1995 Chicago Records re-issue, as well as the 1990 Columbia CD release, such as the \\"kazoo\\"-sounding horn section. <br /> <br />I chose this particular issue, along with the Group Portrait box set (sadly not reissued/remastered when Rhino picked up the Columbia/Chicago back catalog), and Chicago IX 1995 CDs, for the purpose of making an expanded version, a true anthology, of this legendary band in their \\"glory years\\" (1968-75, I-IX), in which I will include two tracks (\\"25 or 6 to 4\\", this live version absolutely smokes the studio cut from II, and \\"I'm A Man\\") from this ignored masterpiece as well as tracks from III and XIII (also ignored on Chicago IX) to add onto it. <br /> <br />Note about the mix, especially the brass section, don't forget, this album was recorded in 1971 (yes, 1971!!!), and the legendary Carnegie Hall's acoustics were never conducive to electronic amplification, as one reviewer mentioned, but it is raw, first take, and the way a live album should be, not remixed beyond recognition to the point of it sounding TOO perfect, but instead one done with passion, heart, and something missing, especially in this day and age of \\"homogenized\\" live albums, which are mostly loaded with overdubbed tracks, \\"crowd noise\\" enhancements, and too-perfect-lip-synced vocals: integrity and respect for their loyal die-hard fans, the music business, and 100% effort in every note played and sung! It's not perfect but it is all real, with none of the enhancements! <br /> <br />Most bands on today's \\"live\\" albums are simply going through the motions, and not really pouring out their heart and soul into making one, they just simply do it to make money, rather than do it for the fans, who they now resort to gouging out of $25.00 a ticket to see what winds up as garbage, and in agreement with one reviewer, this is the best of the 3 live sets Chicago has recorded. No matter what issue of this album you choose, original or remastered, if you are old-school as both a music fan as well as a musician like me, get this one! Highly recommended!
B000EYK4GW|3.0|I don't know why Disney is doing this release, they have deleted some of the \\"Making Of\\" documentaries and bonus music videos that were on the \\"60th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD release.<br /><br />The few extra shorts on this disc were also on the previous \\"60th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD.<br /><br />Bottom line: Get the 30th Anniversary DVD release if you still can.
1594200653|3.0|There doesn't seem to be a historical continuity in the work; it wakes up a few times, say 1960, 1981, and takes a pulse. But it doesn't provide any cause-and-effect understanding of the following key questions: <br /> <br />1. How did France and Germany wind up with such aging populations; how did they develop such sclerotic economies; how did they develop such ingrained antipathy towards the US and UK. <br /> <br />2. Who \\"won\\" the cold war: Was it Regan, the Pope, or Lech Walesa; or was it just that the Soviets lost interest when they realized that they were marching at the head of a parade with no one following. <br /> <br />3. Does the EU really matter: Will inclusion of Eastern Europe small states bring down the economies of the major Western European powers or will there be actual benefits for all <br /> <br />4. Will the emergence of large Islamic and other third world minorities in the major unban centers result in a continuing culture war; will Islam win the demographic battle and forever de-Christianize Europe <br /> <br />These issues were not addressed. They should have been.
B0006PRPBG|5.0|I've got this album on my mp3 player, and everytime a track comes on I'm back in my vinyl days.<br /><br />A mixture of Blues and Rock with Clapton regular Chris Stainton on Keyboards and Albert Lee on Guitar/Keyboards/Vocals.<br /><br />From the first track Tulsa Time you know you're in for a good time. This is a proper live album, no overdubs, no backing tapes just 5 guys and great music.<br /><br />Recorded in 1979 in Japan, neccessarily the sound quality isn't as polished as some might expect these days. Personally I prefer some rough edges and this double album gives it to you raw.<br /><br />Great stuff.
B000AA4F2E|3.0|Der Regisseur, der ein direkter Nachkomme von H. G. Wells ist, hat einmal ge&auml;u&szlig;ert, dass seine Fassung viel n&auml;her an der Romanvorlage als die 1960'er Verfilmung sei. Dem kann ich mich ganz und gar nicht anschliessen. Weder die eine noch die andere Verfilmung k&ouml;nnen sich mit dem Roman von Wells messen, was aber bei Literaturverfilmungen generell relativ normal ist.<br />Doch bringt die Pal-Version von 1960 einiges von dem wissenschaftlichen Idealismus r&uuml;ber, der auch den Roman erf&uuml;llt. Die Neuverfilmung ergeht sich dem gegen&uuml;ber in relativ billiger Weise den &quot;niederen&quot; Gef&uuml;hlen: wegen einer Frau reist der durch die Zeit - auch von den dilletantisch bis &uuml;bertrieben agierenden Schauspielern (Ausnahme: Jeremy Irons als &quot;&Uuml;ber-Morlock&quot;) h&auml;tte ich mir mehr erwartet!<br />Die visuellen Effekte sind schlicht befl&uuml;gelnd, allen voran die Zeitreise, als der Flu&szlig; einen Canyon hineingr&auml;bt...<br />Der teilweise ethnisch bis wuchtig wirkende Soundtrack geh&ouml;rt f&uuml;r mich ebenfalls mit zum Besten was Hollywood so hergibt.<br />Unter dem Strich muss ich sagen, dass mir die &auml;ltere Version mit Rod Taylor besser gef&auml;llt, auch wenn die Neuere naturgem&auml;&szlig; mit besseren Effekten aufwarten kann!er, but could have dealt with separate releases if all the live action stuff had remained intact. <br /> <br />If you are someone who is only interested in the Zelda cartoon, and don't care about the rest, then this will be right up your alley. <br /> <br />If you are a completist like me, you will be at least somewhat disapointed. <br /> <br /> <br />However, even after taking acceptance of what content is included on this set, it still seems silly that the thing is 3  discs and costs as much as it does. During the Super Show episodes, the cartoon segements only accounted for about half of the running time, with the live action stuff being the other half. Since this only mostly includes the cartoons parts with only a few exceptions, there is no reason that this shouldn't be a 2-disc set and about 5 to 10 dollars cheaper. <br />It costs about the same as the SMBSS set, which is 24 complete episodes on 4 discs. This is only 13 (mostly) partial episodes when taking the live-action stuff into account. They seem to be trying to give it the appearance that you are getting more than you truely are. And it is extra disapointing since both releases are put out by the same distributor. <br /> <br />So, its up to each individual to decide if it is worth their money. I just wanted to put the info out there of what exactly is included in this set to not give anyone false hopes (particularly anyone who may have already bought the SMBSS set and not this one). It's certainly not a bad buy, and I do not regret buying it, but it won't fully satisfy the completists out there.
B000DWMYQ8|1.0|This movie is not at all appropriate for children to view. I bought it for my 5 year old daughter as a gift. Shortly into the film I found several mature references. If you care about what your kids watch and are being fed through movies, then stay clear of this DVD.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Titanic is the story of Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt-Bukater, two ill-fated lovers who find each other on the ill-fated ship, the Titanic. The film itself is rated PG-13 for sexuality, nudity, language, and violence. It runs at 194 minutes (3 Hours and 14 Minutes), but nothing of this three hour spectacle is boring! James Cameron's dazzling spectacle of reinventing the wheel is what Titanic is. It is beautifully crafted. It is well-written. It is beautifully acted, and it is beautifully directed. The film has flaws, but for this spectacle, thirty flaws is nothing compared to an hour and a half length film with one hundred goofs.<br /><br />The film opened in December 1997, with a first weekend opening of only 20 million dollars. That is hard to believe, i know, but check anything. It only opened with 20 milion dollars under its belt. That is probably about sixty million dollars today. It would soon grow hype as the best film of the year and earn more that six hundred million dollars, the highest grossing film of all time, in the Unted States alone and over 1.2 billion dollars worldwide. This film was the best picture of 1997, winning 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Costume Design, Best Original Song, and best everything else dealing with cinematography and sound, along with visual effects and music scores.<br /><br />The first DVD release of Titanic was pretty weak, I must admit. All that it had was the film itself in 5.1 Dolby Surround sound with the theatrical trailer. It was also only on one disc. This release of the film was released in 1999. The 3-Disc, ytes 3-Discc set came out on October 25, 2005, leaving Titanic fans, and movie fans, with the collection it well deserves. Entertainment Weekly gave the Special Collector's Edition of Titanic a B-, but it should have received an A. The DVD includes everything a fan could dream up and much more. The first two discs consists of the wonderfully crafted film and audio cmmentary, along with some featurettes. On disc three, though, it includes the who she-bang! It includes 7 featurettes, historical commentary, historical facts about the Titanic itself, the real ship, the \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" music video, over 45 minute of deleted scenes, original concept poserts and one sheets, the whole Titanic script electronically, over 650 pages on the television, visual effects breakdowns, demos, and so much more! THe film is an amazing, dazzling spectacle ehich should be cherished forever and for always. Thanks to Paramount for giving Titanic the rightful collection i deserves.

0380789035|4.0|Gaiman's highly original novel is engrossing almost immediately upon opening the cover. Gaiman's main character, Shadow, is likeable and believable - no small feat given that the book begins with his release from prison and follows him through an adventure with ancient gods and his un-dead wife. In his highly visual style of writing, Gaiman gives us fascinating descriptions of the seemingly indescribable, and draws the reader willingly and unquestioning into his world-behind-the-world of gods, goddesses, and holy roadside attractions. The plot is well-conceived and reads almost like a mystery, allowing the reader to put the pieces together along with Shadow (although at times, perhaps, the reader may be frustrated that Shadow doesn't seem to question his fantastic experiences). Gaiman, an Englishman by birth, has fun with America's history and our collective sense of the divine. There's some ribbing here (the modern gods are largely technological, and inhabit televisions and the internet), but there seems to be a genuine fondness as well, particularly in vivid descriptions of the American midwest and its kooky inhabitants and crumbling roadside attractions. Fantasy and graphic-novel fans will love this book for its author and its subject. Fans of literary novels will find enough research and detail to thoroughly satisfy. Highly recommended.
B000068PQ7|4.0|Gene Clark was a superb, terribly underrated American songster, and this is as good as any instance of his other, somewhat more well-known work. The only songs or performances to compare to these are on \\"The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard and Clark.\\" On this still more personally styled collection of songs, Gene Clark explored the quests of his generation, (\\"The Virgin\\") ... Or examined his own life's work as an artist and creator, as in a piece of particular beauty,\\"Spanish Guitar\\" -the only song I've ever heard Bob Dylan say he wished he had written. Not even collaborators like Robbie Robertson ever received such praise from Bob. As always, Gene's romanticism (\\"With Tomorow\\") and full-hearted writing are moving throughout. Gene was an American treasure, and it's a shame that he wasn't better recognized here during his life. This is one prime example of his work - sweet and understated.
B0000256KE|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. Silly campiness is blended with dark, disturbing subject matter, creating some perfectly cold and chilling music. \\"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\\" has some brilliant Ferry lyrics, with strange music effects and \\"treatments\\". \\"Do The Strand\\" is a very catchy and danceable tune, which I guess is masked with \\"sycophantic\\" innuendo (my imperceptive friends call it cheesy!). \\"Grey Lagoon\\" is one of my favorite tracks, with a jazzy, beautiful little sax melody. It sounds like a concise Zappa jam, though I'm not really perceptive to the skill of the musicians. Overall, the songs are very energetic, and although I'm not a fan of slow songs, the slower tunes are so full of energy and interesting instrumentals that I enjoy them better than the faster tracks. A perfectly creepy ending!
B0001906O0|3.0|I really really love this album. With that said, you must be wondering why I'm giving it 3 stars. Well ... the entire first disc of b-sides is amazing, while the other 3 quickly dive from \\"ho-hum\\" to the point where you're scrapping the barrel for good tracks.  <br /> <br />... AND this would have gotten 5 stars if it were the first (essential) disc for only $10. After breaking the first disc, I pondered whether or not to buy the whole thing new. And then I found it on Napster for $10; think of it as a \\"great b-side album from 3IB - Head Cure + 3 bonus discs.\\" <br /> <br />Yay!

B0001KL5DA|5.0|I recently finished watching the final season of SFU, having bought the DVD set right after its release last month. I have watched the show for three years, beginning with the first season in 2003, a year after my arrival in the US, and purchasing the DVD set of each following season upon their release. I am completely with another reviewer who said that she would sell crack on street if it means limitless SFU. For the last three years, SFU has been a fail-proof anti-depressant for me. Although some see it as deeply depressing, and I agree with them, that very depressing quality always eased my own depression and pain, and strangely enough, made me feel more calm, peaceful, clear, and focused. More than that, it let me see that certain profound yet non-religious spirituality is possible in American pop culture and Americans themselves (one of the misconceptions non-Americans, like me, have about American culture is that, amid the ascendency of fundamentalist Christianity, it is essentially shallow and materialistic, or that it may be characterized as having what Shakespeare called \\"irreligious piety\\"?).<br /><br />I can go on and on about how much I learned from SFU, how great consolation I got from it. So, as a big fan of the show, I see every season as a gem on its own. However, if I am forced to pick my favorite season, I'd pick season 2. It is more relaxed and yet, strangely again, more intense than the first season. Relaxed because I now know what to expect for the Fisher family and their funeral home, and intense because, as one of the axes of the plot-the relationship between Nate and Brenda-unfolds, I see a painful yet true description of why it is so hard for two people to stay together. Also, compared to following three seasons, it contains more of its trade-mark dark humor.<br /><br />In the Special Feature of the final season, creator Alan Ball tells us that Peter Krause's performance of Nate breathed an \\"amazing everyman quality\\" into the character, and while portraying this \\"everyman,\\" that Nate was the one character with a stronger spiritual, (or mystical), bent. This makes perfect sense. Looking back, in the first episode of the Season 2, we see Nate jotting down what his father says in his dream, which turns out to be from Bhagavad Gita. The episode ends beautifully with Nate reading his notes to Brenda, which read: \\"All that lives lives forever. Only the shell, the perishable, passes away. The spirit is without end, eternal, deathless.\\" Here is one of the earliest moments when the contrast between the mentalities of Brenda and Nate is made, a contrast which will be more dramatically depicted in the latter episodes of the final season.<br /><br />I spent a fortune (\\"fortune\\" indeed, considering my miserable income as a graduate student) on the DVD sets of SFU. But it was money well spent, since every episode is infinitely re-watchable and leads us to think about issues that are important.r, and while portraying this \\"everyman,\\" that Nate was the one character with a stronger spiritual, (or mystical), bent.

B00005JOFQ|1.0|I thought this was supposed to be a love story??  First of all the \\"out of nowhere\\" love scene looked more like a prison rape than it did a show of affection between two men, the spitting on the hand for some lubricaton..YEAH!! that was real classy (sarcasm noted)..Then the two cowboys spent the rest of the film claiming that they were \\"not queers\\", as if it were something to be ashamed of..and what about Enis's backwards wife..I mean c'mon, what woman would have kept that secret for twenty years and not have confronted her gay husband ...GET REAL..Horrible cast of characters, I couldn't believe for one second that Enis and Jack were really in love...If Jack really loved Enis why did he have relations with at least two other men in the film (the dude in Mexico, and the other Rancher)..This movie set gay men back another twenty years with its stereotypes and ..big deal two cowboys kissed..was I really supposed to be shocked???  ....Oh yeah, and can anyone tell me what Enis said at the very end of the movie when he was looking at the postcard..I'm sure it was important, but all I could hear was more of Heath Ledgers's bad acting and mumbled voice, and didn't make out a word he said.
B00004VWAF|5.0|For those not familiar with Miles's Second Great Quintet of the mid to late 1960s, there is an undisputed masterpiece performance which redefined the development of a piece of jazz.  This was the title track of \\"Nefertiti.\\"  Instead of playing the head, followed by solos and then the head out, Miles and Wayne Shorter play the melody with slight variations over and over again, while the rhythm section shifts the beat, the accents, the harmonic implications, and every other subtle element of \\"background.\\"  To the uneducated or unhip listener, the performance sounds like it goes nowhere.  However, the dynamic changes and developments in the rhythm section constitute the subtle direction for the piece, while the melody is the thread that holds it together, as opposed to a walking bass line and constant chord changes that are generally the thread in jazz pieces.  Another reviewer from this site described it aptly as being like \\"time lapse photography,\\" where the subject is the same but the hues are slightly different. <br /> <br />\\"On the Corner,\\" the most controversial album Miles ever made, revisits this concept of time lapse photography, albeit in a way that is most offensive to jazz purists but probably the best way to implement the concept.  Instead of using the melody as the thread, he uses the basic rhythm of the drums and the bass line.  This may seem unremarkable in how traditional it is on the surface.  But the groove of bass and drums is SO consistent and unchanging that the thread or continuity has the maximum effect.  From there, Miles adds layer by layer, including various percussion instruments, different chord colors from keyboards and guitar, and then the soloist, but he does it so slowly that each level gets insinuated into the listener's consciousness; we begin to vibrate with the insistence of the music, and just as we get used to it, another layer is subtly introduced, taking the stream of consciousness to a new level.  In fact, the thread of bass and drums remains more or less the same, repeating the same figure, for the last three tunes, or the majority of the album.  The mastery of this album is how everything else grows around it, from the slightest alterations of the drums or the wah of the bass to the sinister chords from Herbie Hancock's rhodes barely audible but profoundly felt as something different.  Funk in and of itself may not be particularly subtle, but what Miles does with it and how this album moves from level to level is more subtle than even \\"Nefertiti.\\"  There isn't even much dynamic change in the traditional sense; it never really gets louder or softer, only thicker and more complex.  Brilliant. <br /> <br />Not surprisingly, Miles alumni were profoundly affected by the concept of this album.  Herbie Hancock's \\"Sextant\\" is quite similar in feel to \\"On the Corner\\" and one could argue that the entire improvisational concept of Weather Report was based on this concept of layering and repetition, with no one instrument more important than any other, though the best example is \\"Sweetnighter,\\" Weather Report's third album.  Neither subsequent album was as successful as \\"On the Corner\\" at this particular concept, though. <br /> <br />A warning (or maybe instructions) to listeners: this album only makes sense if you have the fifty minutes to listen and feel it the whole way through.  I suppose in this way it's not particularly easy to listen to, and it's not a good place to start with Miles nor is it a good bridge from rock into jazz.  If the sonic and psychological experiment of this album sounds interesting to you, a basic understanding of Miles's second great quintet on albums like \\"Nefertiti,\\" \\"Miles Smiles,\\" and \\"Miles in the Sky\\" is required to appreciate its depth, and be sure to check out \\"Bitches Brew\\" and \\"Live Evil\\" to get used to the sometimes abrasive sound of the music.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|A lot of people are saying that Constantine is wrong because Keanu Reeves is wrong for the part but I see it differently. See I'm no fan of Reeves and I actually think of him as a dry and predictable actor that always acts the same in every film. The stories he gets and his supporting cast is so good that they make him look even better and he gets a high price tag. Constantine needed an actor to play the character as a mean, intimidating, and vicious loner and who better to play that than a man who had that exact role in his previous films.<br /><br /> So I don't see Reeves as a problem but why this film gets such low ratings could either be that it's not true to the comic like other reviewers suspected or it could be because it's not true to the history of the real Constantine. Whatever it may be with those who have the knowledge of the comic or factual history this is a good movie either way. The acting is nothing to be excited about but trust me that the movies perspective on good and evil are interesting enough to keep you entertained over and over again. It's got some scares in it if you scare easily and it may even have your mind twisted around it's concepts longer than you think.
B00005JO20|1.0|Is nothing sacred anymore!!!! I understand that this was peter Jackson's inspiration to become a director. Yet, he couldn't leave it alone. He had a long and very successful period doing the LOTR Trilogies, and the extended versions. He had to get caught up in the spotlight, and remake nothing but a capitolist CG attempt of an extremely boring computer game on screen. It doesn't matter that he stuck to the story, this is an example of how unoriginal Hollywood and mainstream movies in general have become. They've ran out of ideas - so they make hybrid parodies. This was depressing, if you love King Kong stick to the original.

B00000DFSK|3.0|When this album came out orignially, there was a 2 disc collectors edition you could buy and I'm very glad I did as it's since been very hard to find.  The second CD conains a bunch of high quality B-tracks including a cover of the song that changed clay wheel spinning forever; Unchained Melody.  There are some really good songs here that represent the evolution and growth of the band throughout the 80's and it's a shame that this second CD isn't still included. <br /> <br />As many U2 fans know, the band evolved and the 80's vs. 90's decades are a good division point for their two \\"Best of\\" discs.  Personally I like their earlier offerings better and I think most fans would agree.  For the casual or new fan, this is an ok CD to start as it has most of the heavy hitters from the band first 5 albums.   Honestly though the Joshua Tree is such a fantastic and complete album that it really warrants its own separate purchase. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  Really worth it if you can get your hands on the B-Side disc.
0792164903|5.0|Ive always been a fan of the occult, and after reading multiple forms of the book by Washington Irving, it became a goal to see the movie. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci were positively stunning in this thrill ride of suspense, lust, power, horror, death, and revenge. This isn't exactly a slasher flick, but that doesn't mean it doesn't spill some blood. It's positively delicious to watch Ichabod (Depp) deduce to the true twisted plot behind the so-called \\"innocent\\" step-mother and the tortured and revenge-seeking horseman.  <br />Sleepy Hollow was my second Tim Burton experience, and I have been hooked on him ever since. Sleepy Hollow combines terror with just about every human emotion that you could possibly imagine. We dive into the true intentions and the twists that power can have on the mind, and how revenge can warp a sense of justice. 'Sleepy Hollow' is definately one of the greatest horror movies out there. Not to mention the superlitive special effects. Watching the horseman and his faithful black horse emerge from the Tree of the Dead is one of the most incredible scenes in the movie. Watching the wind whip everything, and leaves go flying into the air, the tree violently shakes, and a splatter of blood reveals the heads of those missing. Later seeing the old windmill fly up in glowing orange fkames is spectacular. I highly recommend this movie from the bottom of my Tim Burton-loving heart.

It turns out I am a theater-techie or a journalism type or a music type. We had none of that in my high school. We had straight-arrow math and science. If you don't like that, Bub, you just don't fit in. Sorry. We have work to do here, and that work is to produce SAT Merit scholars.  <br />We had English and religion at my Catholic school. We had three foreign languages but no creative writing classes in English. A lot of great teachers but a severely restrained budget. An Appalachian town a world away from D.C. but an hour away from Camp David. Western Maryland. The leftover portion.  <br />I coulda used Stephen King's \\"poor childhood\\". It seems all idyllic in retrospective. This book is a life, a warm retrospect: with all the nice lighting and the warm string quartet. A honey colored amber encasing the seemingly preordained life of a great  writing success. I could in fact hate Stephen King. <br />His writing <br />doesn't attract me. However I love Stephen King simply because he wrote an outstanding book on writing. I wish to throw away any prejudice I may have against him and his writing because this book is a beautiful thing. I felt disappointed that I had to return his fine book to the library. I wanted to keep it for me, and me alone. It BELONGS to ME. I DESERVE it. I want to take this book into my family. I want to not only love this book but to cherish it for a very long time. Stephen King created a book just for me. That my friends is true writing.
B000063JDE|5.0|David Lynch is to be heartily congratulated for delivering a film so nightmarishly real you will wonder if you are dreaming with your eyes open.  What I liked about this book was its unflinching honesty about sexual perversion.  It's all in here.     One of most intriguing characters in the film is Ben (played by Dean Stockwell). He is portrayed as an autogynephilic transsexual with sadistic tendencies (he punches handsome young Jeffrey in the stomach).  It's interesting that an art house film could deal with this topic years before autogynephilia even had a name.
6305076995|5.0|Spectacular. Don't listen to tepid ratings. Excellent original executions of the tunes here, very fresh as the tunes have been recently written and published before the concert (i.e. last couple years before the concert).    These musicians' playing is excellent, and their composition is hard to believe - it's hard to believe they just up and created all this material themselves, out of thin air. Pink Floyd was great, and Genesis was great, but could they keep up with these fellows? I think not!    If you appreciate Yes, you ought to have this early taping of Yes when they're all young and their era is young, and everything is new and fresh and excellent.
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|The Ultimate Collection is not quite the Ultimate Collection of all time, but that would have required many more discs. All the familiar tracks are here plus some rare demos and that great 1992 concert on the fifth disc which is a DVD. To be honest I would have prefered a concert from The Bad Tour for the DVD not The Dangerous Tour. The over-released songs like Billie Jean and Bad are almost irrelevant as most fans have a number of these songs on different versions and DVDs (I have the same Thriller Video on 3 different DVDs). More focus on rare remixes would have been better, and another disc could have been included with just remixes that are out of print. This is a great Box Set but could have been a lot better. The Concert is great in stereo but unfortunately features far too many shots of the crowd which really distracts from the stage show and cuts up the dancing. Fortunately the crowd shots lessen as the concert progresses.
B00006I53S|5.0|I purchased this lens 3 months ago for my Digital Rebel XT and it has become my walking-around lens. I am a novice to digital SLR photography and did a considerable amount of research before buying. I included comments on this board in my research and want to say thanks to all who posted. Everything you said proved to be true.<br /><br />To begin with I like the focal range of the lens. It seems to work well for all the pictures I want to take. The Digital Rebel's 1.6X multiplication factor means on my camera the lens starts at a normalized angle of view of 45 mm (1.6X 28) which is about the natural view. I have not missed the wider angle so far but I have appreciated the additional normalized length of 216 mm (1.6X135). The lens is clear and crisp through the entire focal range, reasonably fast and takes wonderful portrait shots at 70 mm (105 mm normalized). The IS feature is a real plus and I have managed to get some great action shots of my dogs from a distance with the lens.<br /><br />This is a big and somewhat heavy lens and it takes 72 mm filters. Those things don't bother me but a buyer should look at the lens and price the filters before buying. I actually like the weight and the cost of filters was a little high but nothing that would stop me from buying the lens.<br /><br />I considered other lenses but decided that I was not interested in buying the EF-S series because I will probably up grade my camera in the future and don't want to re-purchase lenses if I buy the 5D or its equivalent. In the end this was the lens for me and I recommend it highly.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|Not too long ago, Joss Whedon - the creator of the popular television show, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" - had another show on the air called \\"Firefly\\". It was a western by way of science fiction, and (due to an erratic broadcast order, some would say) it was cancelled before all of its first season episodes were aired. Like many other shows, it developed a devoted following, the series as it stood was released on DVD, and that, you might say, was that.<br /><br />Universal Pictures has decided to gamble on \\"Serenity\\", a feature film version of the show directed by its creator. Mr. Whedon insisted on retaining all of the cast members, and from what I've heard from fans, the film fits well in the program's narrative continuity. Happily, though, it's not a film that preaches exclusively to the converted.<br /><br />The plot focuses on River (Summer Glau), a 18-year-old being conditioned by the Alliance, a passive-agressive version of the Empire in \\"Star Wars\\". Much like her doppleganger Buffy, she has extrodinary fighting abilites, but it's her psychic powers that interest The Alliance the most -- River may contain information that would be incriminating to them. Her brother Simon Tam (Sean Maher) rescues her from their brainwashing, and as the film begins, they're passengers aboard the good ship Serenity.<br /><br />The crew - Captain Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillin), his right hand woman Zoe (Gina Torres), her pilot husband Wash (Alan Tudyk), the Willow-like mechanic Kaylee (Jewel Staite), and hotheaded lunk Jayne (Adam Baldwin) - make their living by pulling small heists here and there, Butch-and-Sundance-style, on the less developed planets. In addition to the usual hazards of larceny, these areas are also rife with the Reivers, savage cannibals who rape and devour their victims alive.<br /><br />Like Han Solo, Malcolm is not too concerned with the political repercussions of his choice of passengers. He mainly sees River as a sort of living Fuzzbuster, potentially able to warn them of danger. However, his crew is starting to chafe with the closeness of space travel. The ship needs repairs, everyone is broke, and Kaylee is bluntly in need of shore leave. The mood of the Serenity is anything but.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the procedures that River has been subjected to have left her unstable, and she begins to have unpredictable, violent episodes. This, coupled with the pursuit of The Operative, an assassin sent by The Alliance to recover her and destroy her comrades, keeps the Serenity in a escalating squeeze play through the rest of the film.<br /><br />\\"Serenity\\" doesn't quite free itself from its television origins as successfully as, say, \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\" or \\"The Fugitive\\". There's a lot of characters and plot to set up, and the first half hour is weighted with talky exposition. While the dialogue is snappy, the abundance of one-liners leaves the characters sounding anachronistic (most of the folksy flourishes sound awkward), and very similar to one another. Perhaps due to their premature cancellation, the performers haven't yet developed the vivid personality contrasts that can make an ensemble so much fun. There's an estranged love interest for the captain (Inara, played by Morena Baccarin), but she has little to do aside from joining the cast for a sequel.<br /><br />Things pick up in the second half, though, once the set-up is out of the way and we can get to the space battles and hand-to hand combat. The action sequences are a bit choppy, but they are brisk and have a nice sense of scale to them without being overwheming. It's good B-movie pulp, with nice pacing and a welcome willingness to put its characters at risk. When it counts the most, the film draws you in and makes you care.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed my stay in \\"Serenity's\\" universe. Whether future movies or a \\"Family Guy\\"-style television resurrection is at hand remains to be seen.tially able to warn them of danger.

B000EMGA3U|5.0|This would be the very first EP by the band that soon became the Greatest American Rock Band of the last 25 years.  It's kind of the band's misbegotten son, the ne'er-do-well.  When they recorded it, they were young, still developing their sound, and relatively unfamiliar with the studio environment.  As a result, the band (and many of their fans) felt it came out rather tepid: a watered down, somewhat sterile version of what they actually wanted to do.  When Geffen started reissuing SY's indie albums in the mid-90's, this was conspicuously left out.  One the \\"best of\\" collection \\"Screaming Fields of Sonic Love,\\" Only \\"I Dreamed I Dream\\" was included, event though I for one always preferred \\"She Is Not Alone\\" (side note: if you hunger for SY-related rarities, try to track down a rather decent cover version of that tune by an industrial outfit named Borghesia).  Well, they've finally gotten around to a reissue, only a few month's before the brand new album \\"Rather Ripped,\\" drops.  I'll be sure to review that, and I can tell you're waiting with bated breath.<br /><br />Now, however, is the time to re-evaluate the EP that broke Sonic ground in 1982 (has it really been that long?  Sweet Evil Jesus, these guys are almost eligible for the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame!).  If you're expecting to hear a rowdy punk beast along the lines of Black Flag's \\"Damaged\\" (one of their faves from that era), you'll be disappointed.  While the chiming, otherworldly guitar textures that made the band's name are in full evidence, here it is indeed restrained somewhat.  What's really different is the drumming.  Like many bands, Sonic Youth went through a few drummers, including future Pussy Galore pounder Bob Bert, before settling in with Steve Shelley.  In '82, the drummer of choice was Richard Edson, who contributed a more tightly rhythmic backbone to the band's guitar explorations.  The resulting sound more closely recalls a lot to the now-legendary post-punk of the era, such as the early work of Gang Of Four and Public Image Ltd.  As such, this is a fascinating document of what could have been.  For a while now, detractors have accused the band of becoming sort of an alt-rock Jam Band.  This of course can be disputed, but I think if they stuck with the sound of this early material, that barb would have never come up.  Mind you, I couldn't hold the band to higher regard as it is, but I find myself loving this album nonetheless.  No, it doesn't come close to equalling later maasterworks such as \\"Bad Moon Rising,\\" \\"Sister,\\" \\"Daydream Nation\\" and yes, even later period albums like \\"Sonic Nurse,\\" but it's really just two views of a pretty damn excellent picture.<br /><br />Not content with just re-releasing the EP, this remastered edition also comes with more than a half-hour's worth of live material from the era, also remastered with remarkable sound quality, considering when it was recorded and where (various hole in the wall clubs).  The live stuff, as you would guess, is a lot noisier than the studio versions, but also surprisingly as tight as Steve Albini's butt cheeks.  You also get a booklet with rare pictures (look for a rather tomboy-ish Kim Gordon) and extensive liner notes/essays by the likes of Avant-Garde composer Glenn Branca, underground rock critic Byron Coley, and even Richard Edson himself, who left the rock world altogether to become an actor (he was in Spike Lee's seminal \\"Do The Right Thing\\" among many others).<br /><br />Again, if you prefer the whirlwinds of noise that Sonic Youth perfected, which influeced countless bands since, this may not be your cup o' poison.  If you're a rabid Sonic Youth fan to the point of irrationality, well, you probably already have this.  Still, if you find yourself sitting on the fence wondering whether you need this in your life: yes, you do.  Especially at a price like just ten bucks.

B000274THQ|3.0|Daniel Bruhl plays Alex, a teenager whose conservative mother Kathrin collapses from a heart attack after spotting him at a protest rally. She spends eights months in a coma, and during that time her homeland transforms -- the Berlin Wall comes down, and western commerce and attitudes flood into East Germany.<br /><br />Kathrin re-awakens, but her health is extremely fragile, and Alex is warned by her doctors that she cannot handle excitement of any kind, much less the shock of the current capitalist explosion. Driven by guilt, he transforms her room, meals, family and friends into the past that she remembers, frantically resurrecting the Communist ideal that she reveres. Initially, the ruse is seamless, but as time goes on, Alex must work harder and harder to narrow an ever-widening gap between the past and present.<br /><br />While the clever premise is irresistable and would seem the perfect vehicle for an ever-escalating farce, Becker takes a far more difficult (but ultimately more satisfying) route into a touching exploration of memory and the lives we create for ourselves and one other.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly strong, and the romance between Alex and Lara (Chulpan Khamatova), a student nurse who cares for his mother, is sweet. The filmmaking is assured, with a nod to Stanley Kubrick while evoking the touching, bittersweet qualities of Lasse Hallstrom's \\"My Life As A Dog\\". There are touches of sped-up silliness, but they don't disrupt the film's spell.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Unique story, energetic soundtrack, authentic scenery, believable characters, and attention to detail combine for a well-made, entertaining movie that's more suspense than horror.  Three young men, each interesting in their own way, want to have fun in Europe before transitioning back to more serious pursuits...but it goes wrong, with them ending up as subjects of wealthy sadists, like a creepy, whistling man who fancies himself a doctor.  Hostel's sick concept of an elite pay-to-torture club comprised of \\"successful\\" folks seemed not so far out to me, since when Hostel came out in the theater, Florida news included men lured by 2 internet friends for torture and/or murder, serial beatings of the homeless, and a guy paying for busfare and hotel so that he could hunt humans in a state park!  Though Hostel is not some deep movie with multiple themes and metaphors, I appreciate the movie for sparking thought on the extent of human depravity, since recognition of sickness is a step to treatment.  (Christian lingo: recognition of sin comes before receiving the Savior.)  I also liked that various responses to violence were explored, ranging from despair to shame to flight to intercession.  Graphic violence and sex, but not gratuitous or glorified.
B000EAT246|3.0|This Special Edition turned out to be not so special after all. Okay, the new transfer is better looking than the previous release. But the movie itself remains the same old version, missing a good bit of the car chase which, for some reason, was included in European copies but was never shown in the US. <br />The missing part - check it out on imdb - takes place when Roy Scheider's wife, rushing to the TV studio with the tape, drives into a back alley with patrol cars on her tail: there, she skids into a wall on two wheels, bangs the roof of her car, then resumes her crazy run as the patrol cars slam into each other - and this is what makes Scheider wince from his chopper above. <br />Apart from leaving aside a nice piece of stunt work, this cut also accounts for a continuity loophole, when we see the car drive into the TV studio parking lot with a badly battered rooftop. <br />Granted, this missing part is no big deal, but it certainly makes this so-called 'Special Edition' a bit of a disappointment. <br />Five stars for the movie, three for the DVD.
B00005MAM2|4.0|I read the book also and the film is a little better. The concept is elaborated a little more in the film. I thought that it started kinda slow, and it's somewhat dated too. But it still stands out as a classic film.<br /><br />I recommend renting instead of buying it.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|This is a really lame dissapointing compilation...plus these guys <br />only made like 3 or 4 good songs. I listened to them for about a <br />month listening to 4 different albums and man...they are really bad. The Beatles don't make good music, period. They are just an overrated, lame, stupid 60's pop band which pop music sucks! Try <br />these bands Dire Straits, Green Day, or even Guns N' Roses. They <br />rock plus they are probably the greatest bands of all time. And I just don't get it why people like THE BEATLES so much. 25 LAME SONGS....AND TWO GOOD SONGS AND THE GOOD SONGS ARE HEY JUDE (WHICH IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST SONGS EVER), AND BALLAD <br />OF JOHN AND YOKO. This band is junk.....throw away, and avoid all albums from Beatles. <br /> <br />Everyone...read my review. <br />ps: Listen to Dire Straits Tunnel of Love insted.
0811732088|5.0|Ein Film, der unter die Haut geht. Die Geschichte zwischen den Charakteren von Jake Gyllenhaal und Heath Ledger ist sehr sch&ouml;n gelungen. Anf&auml;ngliche Zur&uuml;ckhaltung, dann Trennung, doch tief im inneren trotzdem Gef&uuml;hle f&uuml;reinander, die nicht sein d&uuml;rften... Jahre sehen sie nicht, heiraten und bekommen Kinder, bis sie sich schlie&szlig;lich Wiedersehen... Und da f&auml;ngt das Drama an. Der Charakter von Michelle Williams ertappt die beiden, doch anstatt klar zu fragen, was los ist, frisst sie dies in sich hinein...<br /><br />Und dieses Spiel von Michelle Williams hat mich so &uuml;berzeugt, es hat mich so gefesselt und auch ber&uuml;hrt, dass ich besonders ihr den Oscar in der Kategorie \\"Beste Nebendarstellerin\\" geg&ouml;nnt h&auml;tte. Aber da es nicht geklappt hat bedeutet ja nicht, dass sie trotzdem eine sehr gute emotionale und tief bewegende schauspielerisch Leistung abgeliefert hat.<br /><br />Heath Ledger und Jake Gyllenhaal spielen auch fantastisch. Jake Gyllenhaal gefiel mir in Jarhead schon gut, doch Heath Ledger hat mich vollkommen &uuml;berrascht, mit was f&uuml;r einer emotionalen Tiefe er gespielt hat.<br /><br />Der Score gefiel mir richtig gut, er schaffte es, mich an bestimmten Stellen des Films, besonders am Ende, zu bewegen! Eigentlich hat mich das Ende ein wenig besch&auml;ftigt, es war kein typisches Ende, sehr traurig, aber dennoch gut! Oscar als \\"Bester Soundtrack\\" mehr als verdient.<br /><br />Regie ist sehr gut, Ang Lee hat den Oscar mehr als verdient, die Kamera ist auch sehr sch&ouml;n, besonders die Landschaftsbilder sind gut eingefangen.<br /><br />Alles in Allem ein Film, an dem es kaum etwas auszusetzen gibt! Einfach beeindruckende schauspielerische Leistungen, ein kontroverses Thema sehr gut r&uuml;bergebracht, ohne es zu beschmutzen... Gerade wundert es mich, dass diese offene Homosexualit&auml;t in den USA auf eine so hohe Interesse trifft, ist die USA doch bekannt daf&uuml;r, ziemlich pr&uuml;de und zur&uuml;ckhaltend auf solche Themen zu reagieren. Auf jeden Fall freut es mich, einen solchen Film gesehen zu haben.<br /><br />Das einzige, was ich mir im Nachhinein gew&uuml;nscht h&auml;tte: Ein wenig mehr Dramatik.ben. <br />Das einzige, was ich mir im Nachhinein gewünscht hätte: Ein wenig mehr Dramatik. <br />
B000002MFE|5.0|Many people have heard of Eric Clapton's music. Some people love him and some people don't. I believe that this CD show's his true skill in music (Eric Clapton Unplugged). Eric Clapton displays his true dominance of the modern blues genre. I believe that Clapton is the best modern day blues musician because of his master of tone.   This CD has most of Clapton's main hits such as \\"Layla,\\" and \\"Tears in Heaven.\\"  All of the songs are acoustic, which adds a nice flavor to the CD. The songs are all of his classic, thus no new songs. So if you are a frequent Clapton listener you will not find any new material in this CD; although the acoustic guitar adds a different sound to some of them.    The MTV's unplugged series which produced this album is known for good music. Many different artists have played for the series, such as R.E.M, Rod Stewart, and Alice in Chains. MTV have obviously made some mistakes in their music choices but the unplugged series is definitely not one. I think that everyone needs to go and pick up Eric Clapton's unplugged CD. It shows his dominance of the modern blues genre. This is a must have.
0689829590|5.0|I am a speech pathologist who reads this to children from ages three to eight.  The children are soooo impressed with the foldouts and my favorite spot of my day is watching a first time \\"reader\\" of the book as the foldouts spread out.  The pages with the longest ladder anyone has ever seen knock the kids between the eyes!  You HAVE to see their faces!! <br /> <br />The spread of the full moon always evokes a reverent \\"WOW!\\" from any age child.  Their expressions are priceless. <br /> <br />This book is a very good book for teaching so many concepts:  sizes (as the moon gets bigger and then smaller), long, high. <br />While many of the concepts are abstract for language disabled three year olds, it is an impressive book which will teach other concepts and vocabulary. <br /> <br />I agree with another reviewer:  this book should be wider known.  I had no idea it was such a lovely book until I saw it on display in the teacher's lounge.  The display copy was a small board book.  Once I saw the potential of this book, I ordered it in the larger, hard cover version.  It has been a worthwhile investment.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used debut album is BY FAR my favourite album EVER. Every single song on the album is beautifully crafted to perfection. The stand-out songs are Buried Myself Alive, Pieces Mended, Noise and Kisses, Box Full of Sharp Objects, The Taste of Ink, and Maybe Memories. But the whole album is just incredible. <br /> <br />Bert's singing and screaming collab work perfectly together. He's got probably the best scream out of any band at all. The guitar riffs and drum beats are also VERY well done.  <br /> <br />Everything about this album is simply amazing. In Love and Death was such a disappointment. I'll stick to this album.

B000EGCITG|1.0|About the Dear Mr. President Song...Why does this ignorant fool criticize the No Child Left Behind Act???  She's knows NOTHING.  I'm an innercity teacher and I follow the No Child Left Behind Act (Reading First Program).  ALL of my students read ABOVE grade level.  That's unheard of in my neighborhhod. The teachers that complain about it are the same ones who slack off and blame the kids when they fall behind.  Pink's not a teacher.  She's NEVER been to my neighborhood.  What in the world does this privileged, self-indulgent snob know about innercity education?  And she's bashing Bush???  Big surprise--another Hollywood bubblehead hates Bush.  What about Bill Clinton???  I'd bet you dollars to doughnuts she's his fan.  Yet she CLAIMS to be a feminist!!!  Hipocrite.  What a joke she is.  And what did Clinton do to improve the education of low income minorities over eight years?  Nothing. So why does she hate Bush for FINALLY attempting to remedy the educational disenfranchisement of minority youth?  But let's all listen to Pink because her hair is wild, and she was in the Lady Marmelade video...so, I guess this makes her an authority on REAL WORLD issues.  Give me a break!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Yes of course everyone is totally against this movie but it is actually historically accurate besides the whole love story.  I am 16 years old and we are learning about WWII right now and after seeing this movie, I have to say it's pretty good, my history teacher even agrees with me.  When they started bombing Pearl Harbor I felt sad and terrified for all those men who had to die.  They do a really good job on that part.  Even the infiltration of Japan after Pearl Harbor, I can't remember the name of the mission, when they start to lose fuel over the ocean and so forth.  I think the whole love story was just leading up to the big bombing on Pearl Harbor and it was good background.  With nurses being called to duty and American volunteers helping the RAF (Royal Air Force) in England, it's all pretty much historically accurate. <br />I think it's a wonderful movie.
B000CS43X0|5.0|...ist es, was Led Zeppelin auf diesen Scheiben bieten. Zuerst: Die Audioqualit&auml;t ist &uuml;ber jeden Zweifel erhaben. Die Videoqualit&auml;t ist ebenfalls sehr gut, vor allem wenn man bedenkt, zu welchen Zeiten die Konzerte mitgeschnitten wurden und wo sie &quot;ausgegraben&quot; wurden.<br />Auf dieser Doppel-DVD reiht sich ein Highlight an das andere, es ist so sch&ouml;n, es tut fast weh.<br />Von den Anf&auml;ngen der Band zeugt das Konzert in der Royal Albert Hall (1970): roher, energiegeladener und unverf&auml;lschter Sound. Live noch viel intensiver. Besonders &quot;Dazed And Confused&quot; ist der Burner. Zus&auml;tzlich gibt's auf DVD No. 1 noch einige Fernsehauftritte, u.a. den Auftritt, der die Band veranlasste, auf TV-Auftritte komplett zu verzichten. War mit Sicherheit eine gute Entscheidung.<br />Auf DVD No. 2 geht es dann mit meinem pers&ouml;nlichen Favoriten weiter: Auftritt im Madison Square Garden (1973). Leider mit 4 Liedern etwas kurz geraten, aber daf&uuml;r von einer Qualit&auml;t die seinesgleichen sucht. Ich habe nie ein sch&ouml;neres &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; geh&ouml;rt. Dieses Konzert gibt es im &Uuml;brigen in voller L&auml;nge auf der DVD &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;. Leider kann die Film-DVD aber bei weitem nicht mit diesem Konzert mithalten.<br />Nach dem New York Gig folgt ein Teil der legend&auml;ren Earls Court Konzerte (1975). Besonders Trampled Underfoot ist sehr sch&ouml;n geworden. Hier findet man<br />auch das un&uuml;bertroffene &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; wieder, welches mit einem unglaublichen Solo von Jimmy Page aufwartet. Atmosph&auml;risch sehr dicht.<br />Abschlie&szlig;end geht's auf's Knebworth Festival (1979). Auch hier entfalten Led Zeppelin eine Wucht, wie man sie sonst nirgends findet. Man begegnet u.a. einer sehr sch&ouml;nen Version von &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;. Aber auch die anderen Titel sind einfach genial.<br />Als Bonusmaterial gibt's auf DVD No. 2 einige Interviews von Plant und Page zu sehen, die sehr nett sind, um eine ungef&auml;hre Ahnung zu bekommen, wie Led Zeppelin waren.<br />Die Box, in der die DVDs ausgeliefert werden, ist sehr sch&ouml;n gemacht und auch recht robust. Zu jeder DVD gibt's ein kleines Booklet, welches ein wenig &uuml;ber die DVD und Led Zeppelin zu dieser Zeit erz&auml;hlt.<br />Led Zeppelin sind live einfach un&uuml;bertroffen. Ich k&ouml;nnte hier noch lang reden, aber das MUSS man einfach gesehen haben. Wer diese DVDs nicht besitzt, verpasst einiges.

But this is an underrated album that needed more emphasis.     SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE (1982)   TRACKS HERE: You've Got Another Thing Coming, The Hellion, Electric Eye, Screaming For Vengeance   COMMENTS: To put it simply, this is the most popular Judas Priest album. Choosing what songs to put on here from the album was obviously no easy task, since there were so damn many good ones to choose from. For the most part, the Sony people managed well. Still, I missed Riding On The Wind, Bloodstone, and (Take These) Chains.     DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH (1984)   TRACKS HERE: Love Bites, Freewheel Burning, Jawbreaker, The Sentinel   COMMENTS: Same situation here. Great album with a lot of great songs, and no small number of choices. These are all great songs, and fairly big hits for the group. But where's Some Heads Are Gonna Roll, and Rock Hard Ride Free?     TURBO (1986):   TRACKS HERE: Turbo Lover, Out In The Cold   COMMENTS: When Priest went pop metal, they released this album and got a very mixed reaction. Nonetheless, the album still did well in the eyes of many of the band's fans. These are the two biggest hits from the album, and they're good songs. Locked In, Private Property, and Reckless would have been nice additions, though.     RAM IT DOWN (1988)   TRACKS HERE: Ram It Down, Blood Red Skies   COMMENTS: Another \\"mixed reaction\\" album for the band. As such, emphasis is fairly limited on this one. But despite this, the band remained wildly popular. These were two of the most popular songs from the album. I miss Heavy Metal and Johnny B. Goode, though.     PAINKILLER (1990)   TRACKS HERE: A Touch Of Evil, Painkiller, Night Crawler, Hell Patrol   COMMENTS: The swan song from the classic lineup, until the reunion. After two questionable pop-metal albums, the band released this heavy metal onslaught on an unsuspecting world. The title track is one of the best Priest songs ever. The other tracks featured here are no slouches ether. Still, All Guns Blazing and Leather Rebel would have gone well on here.     JUGULATOR (1997)   TRACKS HERE: NONE   COMMENTS: This was one of the albums with Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens singing. The Sony people must have wanted to do Halford-only stuff on here, and I respect that. The Ripper albums were no prize. The lack of tracks here doesn't hurt me one bit.     DEMOLITION (2001)   TRACKS HERE: NONE   COMMENTS: The other Ripper album, so it's the same situation. No harm, no foul.     ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION (2005)   TRACKS HERE: Judas Rising, Revolution   COMMENTS: Nice tracks from the band's Halford reunion album. But where are Deal With The Devil, Wheels Of Fire, and Worth Fighting For, the other big hits from the album? I don't blame the record company for not wanting to overemphasize the new album, but I still miss these songs.     OTHER COMMENTS:   For the most part I am happy with this compilation, I just wish they hadn't left off so many songs, and I wish they hadn't messed up the running order of the tracks. Most of the other Essential compilations are chronological order, so why not this one? Overall it's a good enough compilation, but it could have been better.     OVERALL:   Overall, it's a good compilation. If you don't want to spend the money to get all of the band's albums, this makes for a fine alternative. Looking for a Judas Priest retrospective? If so, this is the way to go! It's best to buy all of the band's albums rather than a compilation, but if you're on a budget, this is the one to go with. Recommended for casual/beginning fans!     EDITION NOTES:   Not much to say here. It's a new compilation, and as such, it is readily available in just about every American store that has a decent-sized compact disc selection.
B000060MWU|1.0|This transfer looks like a poor cam shot in a theater. I have seen better bootlegs from cam shots than this DVD. It looks horrible. I wish I could rank the film seperate from the DVD quality -- since I can't, I am going to put 1 star due to the transfer; if I could put a lower rating, I would. That's how unprofessional this transfer is.
B00004RFFS|4.0|Interview with the Vampire, based on the book by Anne Rice, seems to constantly meet itself halfway, resulting in a movie that some will love and some will hate. The movie begins with Daniel Malloy, played by Christian Slater, sitting down to an all night interview with 200 year old vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac, played by Brad Pitt. The story is conveyed in the form of a flashback, with Louis narrating to Daniel as the story unfolds on the screen. Louis, who has lost the will to live due to the decease of his wife and child, is invited to die by the arrogant and mischievous vampire Lestat, played by Tom Cruise; die, that is, and live forever. The story winds through Louis's life with Lestat and their vengeful vampire \\"daughter\\" Claudia, played by Kirsten Dunst; a child who can never age, to his exploration to Europe and the Theatre of the Vampires, a coven led by the mysterious Armand, played by Antonio Banderas.  <br /> <br />The screenplay is written by Anne Rice herself, and remains very true to the original novel, which will please fans of her writing. However, to those who have not read the book, many times the characters' motives will be hard to understand, as well as the particulars of vampire \\"life\\". The writing does an excellent job of bringing the undead characters to life, from the witty banter of Lestat to the lamentations of the lost soul Louis. <br /> <br />However, the acting does not manage to do justice to the wonderful writing in many instances. Though the movie featured many high-powered stars, few of them really seemed up to the challenge that the roles present. Brad Pitt, as Louis, pouts and groans his way through his role, making Louis seem less like a complex character than a brainless blubbering ninny. Likewise, the over-acting Antonio Banderas does little to develop the character of Armand, and his trademark Spanish accent is jarring at times and completely inappropriate for the character. Yet surprising was the performance of Tom Cruise,who really captures the essence of Lestat, and also of Kirsten Dunst, who played her role of a mature woman in a child's body to the point of being suitably unnerving. <br /> <br />Being a vampire movie, Interview features plenty of blood, gore, blood, and some more blood. However, it is by no means an 80's style slasher flick, and recalls the intelligent, mind bending horror movies of earlier times more than The Nightmare on Elm Street. The visual effects can be laughably cheesy at times, as vampires soar through the air as if on invisible fly wires, but the blood effects are chillingly good, and will repulse horror buffs until they find themselves moved to tears. The sets and costumes are equally beautiful and appropriate, and really add to the atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br />This movie is not for everyone. It has some very disturbing content, and does contain full frontal nudity, earning an R rating, but it is a must see for fans of the book, horror buffs, and people who enjoy a great action-packed and intelligent story, but don't mind one that's a bit unsettling. I personally enjoyed the movie on the whole, even with all its shortcomings, and would say it is best enjoyed when coupled with the original novel.
0446677450|5.0|I was really impressed with this book.  It took me awhile to come around to it because it messed with my thinking so much, but since I have come to hold this book in high regard.  This is mostly due to the unorthodox nature of this book compared with other financial books and advice.<br /><br />This book spells out financial advice that is usually complex and jargon-filled, in an easy to understand, straightforward, tell it like it is fashion.  Robert Kiyosaki does not shy away from saying the tough truths that we all need to face ourselves.<br /><br />Essentially, this book is about changing your thinking fundamentally about how you look at money.  Instead of purchasing liabilities, people need to be looking at ways to buy/acquire/create assets.  While this book doesn't get into that specifically, it does provide a good starting point for where to look next.<br /><br />This book is also essentially a sales pitch for the game \\"Cashflow\\".  However the game itself is fantastic and I would highly recommend that as well.<br /><br />In summary, this book will mess with your mind.  But stick with it and let some of the messages in.  I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  5 out of 5 stars.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|English and pastoral... Countryside was captured with extreme authenticity and delicacy!  I was stuned by this wonderful adaption of the Jane Austen novel. With a spontaneous direction from Joe Wright, Pride & Prejudice leaves you happy!  Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland are wonderfully casted for this brilliant romance. Also Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench portrayed extremelly well their charachters. Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy and Jena Malone as Lydia, Elizabeth's younger sister, are also good. I must say that they all portrayed their charachters with gusto!  Dario Marianelli creates a wonderful score wich fits with the rural England scenario. I think - that is my opinion - Dario found a great inspiration on the famous Virginia Astley's 'From Gardens Where We Feel Secure' CD. It evokes the England countryside easily.  I have my DVD copy now and if you like a great romance please add this new one.    With my eyes wide open I'm dreaming...
0440241588|5.0|The Broker is one of John Grisham's best novels since The Partner.  Grisham's use of layers to characterize the persons in this book.  Joel Backman's character is impeccably drawn to give the reader and idea of his mental strength.  He is a strong man that made a living cheating and lobbying the most powerful men in Washington. As his lobbying firm grew, Backman gets into trouble and goes into jail for his corrupt practices. Joel Backman is sprung from jail by a presidential pardon and sent into hiding under the C.I.A.  Joel Backman is sent to Italy where he blends in and becomes a native Italian (except his bumbling Italian).  <br /> The Broker is a book filled with intrigue that keeps you reading.  As the story progresses the reader is sucked into the book and almost becomes a spectator in the cat and mouse game that Joel Backman has gotten himself into. Many characters are set into every Grisham book to reveal and unwind the plot until the last pages, in The Broker the story becomes unwound throughout the book leaving questions in your head.  The Chinese, Israelis, and Americans all looking for.  This plot is the most  advanced and indepth book ever written by John Grisham. <br />When Grisham has told uncoiled the rope that keeps the reader going you see that while Backman's pursuerers believe they have Backman in their hand Joel Backman stuns all of the `cats' and reveals his ace up his sleeve.  This book written in typical Grisham fashion while still having a technological and not solely political taste. <br />
0895260131|5.0|The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades is a MUST read for every person living in the West.  It is an incredible account of historical fact and direct comparisons of the doctrine of Christianity and Islam.   <br /> <br />Some other reviews of this book trivialize the distinction between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam as all being a sham.  If that is what you take away after reading this book then you didn't read it.  This book is not about religion but about fundamental human rights that are under vicious attack by Islam on a global scale today.   <br /> <br />I finished reading it today, April 13, 2006, the same day that confessed al-Qaida conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui said in US Federal Court in Alexandria, Virginia, \\"Islam requires Muslims to be the world's superpower.\\"  According to the Associated Press report on the trial, Moussaoui said this statement as he was flipping through a copy of the Koran searching for verses to support his assertions.  One he cited requires non-Muslim nations to pay a tribute to Muslim countries.  He went on to say that \\"We (Islam) have to be the superpower.  You have to be subdued.  We have to be above you.\\" <br /> <br />Why would this convicted terrorist say such things?  Because he believes them.  Why does he believe them?  Because the teachings of Islam as outlined in the key doctrine of the religion, the Koran, says it must be so.  The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades is incredibly researched, thoughtfully presented and intellectually stimulating.   <br /> <br />This is not a book that bashes Muslims.  This is a book that candidly points out the core beliefs of Islam and how Muslims who are strict followers of the word are winning victories across the globe that they were unable to do in the 11th & 12th Centuries.   <br /> <br />If you read no other book this year, read the Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades.  The famous quote \\"There are none so blind as those who willnot see,\\" perfectly sums up the Politically Correct crowd in the Western world and this books points out their folly will be the doom of us all.   <br />

B00005ASHM|5.0|...If fans stopped trying to play \\"Can You Top This?\\" between The Beatles and The Beach Boys? Sure, RUBBER SOUL inspired PET SOUNDS which inspired SGT. PEPPER'S which inspired SMILE which inspired THE WHITE ALBUM, etc., so forth, so on, and who cares?<br /><br />The fact is that each of the aforementioned records was a major musical milestone on the road from Rock 'n' Roll to Rock, from the concept of adolescent rebellion to young adult protest, and from craft to art. When one considers that all this happened in the space of about three years, the spirituality of it is overwhelming. 1967 was the high-water mark of the so-called Counterculture, and these are its anthems.<br /><br />PET SOUNDS is Brian Wilson's first and most successful attempt to transform simple surf and car tunes into chamber music. Audacious and yet hauntingly familiar, PET SOUNDS works dynamically to present us with a uniquely artistic All-American sound. While not as seamless as SGT. PEPPER'S, PET SOUNDS avoids the LSD-fueled visionary pretentiousness of that Beatles entry. Whether PET SOUNDS is a \\"better\\" album than SGT. PEPPER'S is impossible to say. They are both glorious, different enough each to stand alone, and yet they complement each other, being two views of the same musical landscape.<br /><br />This PET SOUNDS release is rather unique in itself, being two versions (mono and stereo) of the same album. There are some interesting variations in music and lyric sprinkled throughout the different versions, and with it's variegated detail, PET SOUNDS commands your attention. Plus, the hits just keep on coming. Thanks, Boys.
0439650771|1.0|....und das ist sehr schade, denn es wäre dank der derzeitigen Tricktechnik möglich gewesen, anahnd es berühmten Stoffes, etwas Einzigartiges zu schaffen. Tricktechnisch ist dies sogar gelungen. Sonst leider nicht. Waren die bisherigen seriosen King Kong Verfilmungen immer auch ein Spiegel für die Menschen sich nicht an der Natur zu vergreifen, weil dadurch ganze Kulturen zerstört werden können (wie das bei der grossrtigen Verfilmung aus den 70igern mit Jessica Lange gelang), liegt hier wiedermal völlig einfalslose und auch noch masslos überzogene Effekthascherei vor, mit keinem anderem Zweck alls Action zu präsentieren. Schön, ein jugendliches Publikum wird das wohl gut finden, doch King Kong hätte mehr verdient. <br />Anfangs ist der Film durchaus noch seheneswert obwohl da schon der Verdacht aufkommt dass auf Charakterdarsteller verzichtet wurde weil es nichts dazustellen gibt. Naomi Watts ist ein hübsches Blondchen mehr nicht. Jessica Lange gab mit ihrer eigenen Melancholie dem Film etwas Tragisches, ihre Suche nach Geborgenheit erweckte Sehnsüchte und Verständnis dafür dass sie in diesem Naturphänomän Kong anfangs zwar durch panische Angst geschüttelt später erkennt dass dieses Geschöpf allein ist wie sie und später, zum Zwecke der Profitgier auch noch seiner Heimat beraubt, dann einfach getötet wird. Das macht sie wütend und nicht nur sie. Naomi Wats gibt diesem Film einen schönen Körper mehr nicht.<br />Spätestens wenn King Kong auftaucht, der zugegeben tricktechnisch einzigartig gelungen ist, merkt man schnell dass es sich hier nur um ein losgelassenes Monster handelt das rumprügelt hüpft,springt, brüllt und einfach Action machen soll. Wie ein übergrosser Orang Utan sieht er aus nichts mehr majestätsiches ist an ihm wenn er um die Ecke hüpfend daherrumpelt wie ein tollwütiges Eichhörnchen. <br />Die Eingeborenen haben keine eigene Kultur sondern haussen wie Steinzeitmenschen sehen aus wie Orks, fressen sich wohl gegenseitigund schmeissen alles was sie vor die Füsse kriegen diesem tollwüten Affen vor die Füsse. <br />Überhaupt verkommt der ganze Auftritt in der Insel zu einer Mischung aus Gruselfilm -überall Totenköpfe (sogar die Felsen im Meer sehen so aus) dunkel düster unheimlich wirkt alles- und Jurrasci Park. <br />Aber das ist immer noch zu verkraften. Schlimm wird es dann wenn die Action richtig losgeht. Einen dermaßen übertriebenen Unsinn hat man selten gesehen. Das Verdirbt den gesamten Film da man das einfach nicht ernst nehmen kann, denn was der Mensch nicht als echt empfinden kann berührt ihn auch nicht. Das ist doch die Kunst des Films Dinge die nicht real sind real erscheinen zu lassen. In Herr der Ringe ist das Jackson hervorragend gelungen. Hier leider absolut misslungen. <br />Ganze Rudel von Dinosaueren zwängen sich druch engste Schluchten zwischen ihren Füssen und auf deren Rücken rennend eine Handvoll Menschen die dann gemeinsam mit Ihnen in eine tiefe Schlucht stürzen doch oh Wunder es fast alle überleben. <br />So geht das eine Stunde lang, wie gesagt wer Action ohne Ende und ohne Sinn mag, hier gibt es das Zuhauf. <br />Die Geschmacklosigkeit und Einfältigkeit erreicht den traurigen Höhepunkt wenn dann eine Horde überdimensionierte Insekten losgelassen wird. Die einen stülpen sich wurmartig wie ein riesiger Schlauch über die Köpfe und Arme der Menschen, was nur noch eckelhaft anzusehen ist, die anderen fliegenden peinigen in ganzen Rudeln den Rest, wobie es einem tapferer Held schließlich gelingt mit einem Maschinengewehr alle Schäferhundgroßen Wespben von einem befallenen Menschen zu schießen obwohl dieser während der gesamten Schießvorführung von Sinnen umherrennt und um sich schlägt. Oh Wunder die Maschinengewehrsalven voll auf ihn draufgehalten treffen nur die Insekten. Wie gesagt für jugendliche sicherlich witzig und unterhaltsam mit King Kong hat das nichts zu tun. Für Erwachsenere alles andere als zu empfehlen.<br />Damit hatPeter Jackson meiner Meinung nach den Ruf ein Meister der erwachsenen Fantasie zu sein schon bei seinem ersten Projekt nach Herr der Ringe verloren. Wenn er das so haben will dann sollte er wieder zurückkehren zu seinen albernen Horrorfilmchen wie früher, ganz davon los kam er ohnehin nie, denn wie in King Kong so auch schon in Herr der Ringe waren immer wieder deutliche Ausprägungen aus seiner Horrorvergangenheit erkennbar (z.B. Saurons Mund, die Orks, deren übertriebene Gier an Brutalität)<br />Fazit: Wieder mal wurde ein sog. Blockbuster angekündt der sich in eine Reihe stellen kann mit den Matrix- und Star Wars Fortsetzungen die allesamt schlecht und danebengeraten sind. Schade
0143036556|2.0|I picked up Collapse at Costco as I was going to be on vacation and needed some reading. I had already read Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel and found it lacking, but Collapse was supposedly about a different topic, it was not as thick as GG&S, and Diamond is a pretty good writer, so I thought I would give it another chance.<br /><br />I was sorry.  This book is more personal memoir and opinion than it is about an investigation of why and how civilizations collapse.  The book starts with 23 page prologue where Diamond acknowledges his biases and tries to tell the reader how to read the book -- always a sign of a challenging read.<br /><br />The environmental movement is critical to our future.  However, Diamond fails to recognize that this movement began at the grass roots and moved upward, yet the issues and actions he is suggesting are often top down making this a policy wonk book for people in Washington DC and Geneva.<br /><br />The discussions of different societies in collapse are romanticized, not particularly well analyzed and always come to the same conclusion -- it's the environment stupid.  This is true, but not particularly helpful.  As exemplified by Diamond's advice for China \\"My best case scenario for the future is that China's government will recognize that its environmental problems pose an even graver threat than did its problem of population growth.  They may then conclude that China's interests require environmental policies as bold, and ad effectively carried out, as its family planning policies.\\"  Sorry but I did not need to wade through 377 pages to come to that conclusion.<br /><br />If I were to apply and follow Diamond's logic, development almost always leads to disaster so it may be best not to develop.  I can accept that back to nature advice however than we would also have to expect the other consequences in our personal, professional, and future lives.<br /><br />People will say that this is an important book, sorry that I am not one of them.<br /><br />If you loved Guns, Germs and Steel, then what I say does not matter, you will like this book too.  If you were like me, looking to give Diamond another chance then I would pass.m not one of them.   <br /> <br />If you loved Guns, Germs and Steel, then what I say does not matter, you will like this book too.

B000A6CLL0|5.0|Whatever reservations I may have had about this show were quickly dissipated with season 3, which gave us one of the best long-running sci-fi story arcs I've seen and almost easily the best in Star Trek history (edging out DS9's Final Chapter).  Probably season 3's greatest attribute is its relative consistency.  Sure, not every episode was great, but each had something to add to the lengthy plot, and it usually entertained in the process.  The end result was an ambitious season highlighted by enjoyable storytelling, excellent f/x, and plenty of tension and intrigue. <br /> <br />The Xindi- B.  A good start to the Xindi arc, with interesting conflicts aboard the ship and a damn good action sequence at the end of the episode. <br /> <br />Anomaly- B.  This episode further highlights the dangers of the Delphic Expanse in a convincing and entertaining fashion. <br /> <br />Extinction- B-.  Okay, I know this one's universally despised, but I was pretty amused by it through and through. <br /> <br />Rajiin- B-.  I was hoping to see more between the ultra-hot Hoshii and Rajiin, but the scene just cut away!  Otherwise, it's a enjoyable enough episode. <br /> <br />Impulse- A-.  Zombie Vulcans!  Though it doesn't particularly further the Xindi arc, this is still an exciting, action-packed episode. <br /> <br />Exile- B-.   <br /> <br />The Shipment- B.  Adds an extra dimension to the already intriguing Xindi race. <br /> <br />Twilight- A.  Possibly the season's best episode, even if it does seem a bit inspired by TNG's Yesterday's Enterprise and 50 First Dates.  Still, it represents everything I love about Star Trek. <br /> <br />North Star- B.  Another unpopular episode, this time saved by a really cool shootout/fight scene at the end. <br /> <br />Similitude- C-.  Despite the moral complications, I found this a pretty dull Tucker episode. <br /> <br />Carpenter Street- C+.  Watchable, but it doesn't really succeed as a time travel piece or as an action episode either.<br /> <br />Chosen Realm- C+.  Pretty much a filler episode, though I did like the final scene. <br /> <br />Proving Ground- B.  Nice to see Shran again, especially in an episode that delivers its share of thrills and intriguing plot turns. <br /> <br />Stratagem- B+.  It's a lot of fun watching Archer and the crew try to manipulate Degra. <br /> <br />Harbinger- B.  A solid episode that furthers the story arc while also giving us an enjoyable fight scene between Reed and Major Hayes. <br /> <br />Doctor's Orders- B-.  The season's Dr. Phlox episode, and while I think it could have been even creepier, it still does a nice job building a sense of isolation. <br /> <br />Hatchery- B-.   <br /> <br />Azati Prime- B.  Another good episode, though I would have liked a bit more expansion on that future Daniels was showing to Archer. <br /> <br />The Damange- B+.  Archer goes to some extreme lengths to continue his mission.  It's breaking these ehtical boundaries that make this a very compelling episode. <br /> <br />The Forgotten- B.  A decent episode as Archer tries to convince the Xindi they're being manipulated. <br /> <br />E squared- B-.  The premise is intriguing and most of the episode does entertain, but it doesn't end on the most satisfying note. <br /> <br />The Council- B+.  The pace reaches a feverish height as we approach the end of the arc.  There's plenty of dramatic conflict and a cool space battle towards the end. <br /> <br />Countdown- A.  Wow.  As a pure thrill ride, Countdown is one of the best Star Trek episodes ever, highlighted particularly by an awesome space battle worthy of the big screen.  Toss in some exciting phaser fights and the death of a major character and we've got one of my favorite Trek episodes, period. <br /> <br />Zero Hour- B.  After the frantic thrills of Countdown, things actually slow down a bit for the first half of Zero Hour, hurting the momentum somewhat.  Thankfully, the second half of the episode packs some exciting action and ends the Xindi arc on a strong note (rather reminiscent of Star Trek: Nemesis now that I think about it).  The plot twist at the end does seem pretty gratuitous, though.
B000002UYZ|5.0|THE BEATLES 1962-1966 is a compilation album covering the first four years of the band's commercial existence. Often referred to as \\"The Red Album,\\" this with THE BEATLES 1967-1970 (\\"The Blue Album\\") is the quintessential Beatles \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection. They were both released in 1973 as double albums to chronicle the band's career. The double album THE BEATLES (\\"The White Album\\") is of course part of the formal Beatles discography. Capitol has chosen to re-release them all as twin CD collections in keeping with the initial vinyl releases. This profit-driven decision did drive up the purchase price, but critics of this policy need to consider that neither The Red Album nor The Blue Album are absolute \\"must haves\\" for a Beatles collection. If price is a consideration, simply give these two a pass and buy the original albums.<br /><br />The true drawback to The Red Album is that a devoted Beatles fan will own (or want to own) the entire formal disc collection. Therefore, these compilations become somewhat extraneous.<br /><br />Still, they are worth having, even if just to listen to in the car, or for variation. The Red Album has several slightly different mixes than the original release recordings or other Beatles collections, and purists or pundits will want them.<br /><br />For casual listening, The Red Album is an excellent Beatles sampler. It carries the band from the innocent monaural days of \\"Love Me Do\\" all the way to the psychedelic era of \\"Yellow Submarine.\\" We get to hear The Beatles mature and grow, experiment and experience. For anyone who was there, this is an encapsulation of the early '60s.<br /><br />As an aside, another excellent collection is 1976's hard-to-find THE BEATLES ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSIC, which provides us with early Beatles covers of other performers' material.<br /><br />Remembering, as I do, the first time I ever heard, \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand,\\" circa the summer of 1964, sitting in the backseat of my father's 1960 Impala convertible, The Red Album becomes my private time machine. It is amazing how far The Beatles came in just four short years, and how they managed to bring us with them.<br /><br />Together with The Blue Album this collection IS the Magical Mystery Tour.machine.

B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Chicken Little is a great movie with wonderful animation and catchy songs. It's about not giving up, and believing you can make it even when you're very small. Kids can definitely relate and the ending is superb. Watch it with your little people in case they have questions. There are enough gags in the film to make grownups laugh too. One note of caution, for some reason I don't know why Hollywood feels the need to pander to the homosexuals by putting an acknowledgment scene in every single movie. It's so incredibly annoying. Chicken Little is no different, although the homosexual references are not as overt. The character Runt of the Litter is decidedly anti-male. There's a reference to his Streisand collection being taken away as punishment, and Runt does a duet to an Elton John/Kikki Dee song at the end. Disney backpedals on the issue, because later you see Runt of the Litter hooking up with the transformed formerly anti-female character Foxy Loxy. Foxy Loxy is the quintessential dyke/bully/jock whose lackey Goosey Loosey does her dirty work. All in all, if you can overlook that part, it's actually a good movie. You'll enjoy it, and the kids won't get the sick stuff unless you point it out.

As usual, people will criticize this for too much lyrics...but Roger just has so much to say, and he does it so well.  I love concept albums, and Roger does it better than anyone.  That being said, you wont find maybe any singles...this is a piece that must be played start to finish...to fully enjoy, to be moved by, and to be entranced in.

B000EHRVP6|5.0|If you submitted a bad review for this movie, go back to watching Shrek. This is obviously geared towards 18-30 males, but it's also a good movie with your girlfriend (if she isn't squemish). In this genre of movie, I honestly couldn't think of a better way to make this. I'm not even a big fan of Tarantino, but this is SUPERB movie making. From start to finish. PERIOD. <br /> <br />Let me state why this movie is one of the best or perhaps the greatest thriller of all time. It's not so much a horror flick, as more of a crazy (yet very possible) suspense movie. <br /> <br />1) The location. I've been to Prague (they filmed near Prague). This town the movie takes place in has the look AND feel of a Slovakian city. Eastern Europe. Old cars, very old yet beautiful buildings, gangs, GRAFITTI (anyone that's been to eastern Europe will see LOTS of grafitti). It really makes you feel like you're there. Great film work. Even the cheesy 80's sounding rock in the \\"disco\\". Tarantino and Roth really know how to research! <br /> <br />2) The actors. No namers, but yet VERY good at playing their roles. Even down to the 'friendly' student-aged hostel employees (most hostels are run by backpackers trying to make some extra cash). The women DEFINITELY portray crazy party girls from eastern europe (one girl is from Russia, the other Prague). Of course, it doesn't hurt that they are very attractive. The German guy is also a PERFECT match for his role. Oli, the Icelandish guy is also INCREDIBLE in this movie. <br /> <br />3)The story. Yes, it's hedonistic (partying, drinking, drugs, sex). But that's what a lot of American teens think they will get in places like Amsterdam. Not too off target. <br /> <br />also the idea of the hostel is based on the idea of \\"tourist traps\\" that americans can find themselves in. They definitely TARGET americans to get their money somehow.  <br /> <br />4) The senseless violence. Like it or not, there are a LOT of people in this world that hate Americans, yet they've never even met one. If you watch closely, you'll see that they also target Russians and Germans in this movie. Obviously Eastern Europe is not very fond of these people (see World War II/Cold War). The violence itself is disgusting, yet realistic. It looks very real, which makes it even scarier.  <br /> <br />5) **** SPOILER ******* <br /> <br />The revenge in this movie is the best I've ever seen. Easily beating Brotherhood of the Wolf and the Count of Monte Cristo (two of my favorite revenge themed movies).  <br /> <br />If you believe in Karma, this will surely make you feel relieved when you see what happens when you break 'the golden rule'. <br /> <br /> <br />A++++ Roth and Tarantino
1573223085|1.0|Pink is correct - Abundance, Asia, and Automation will be hard on those with left-brain, analytical skills.  However, these factors will also make the future difficult for Americans with right-brain skills as these can also be performed by Asians or automation at low cost.<br /><br />Even those with high touch skills are vulnerable - look at the increasing range of jobs being performed by illegal Mexican.  At first it started with farm and domestic labor, then on to fast-food and heavy construction labor.  Now they increasingly are employed operating machinery and performing carpentry, painting, carpentry, rug-laying, etc.  At the same time, President Bush wants to open truck driving to countless Mexican citizens as well.  Perhaps the only Americans really safe, even with high-touch skills, are reporters needing a good command of English.

B000301YY8|1.0|I would first like to say that I do not agree with calling James Blunt's voice \\"angelic\\". It is anything but. It reminds me of a car's gears grinding; a curious blend of the lovely sound of the a car starting, and the atrocious grating of metal against metal. A truly angelic voice can be heard from Tom Chaplin of Keane. Anyway, I saw the music video for a song called 'You're Beautiful'. At first I thought, 'Dear God, man, put on a shirt!' Is it me or does 'You're Beautiful' win the Most Lackluster Love Song of 2006? I mean, I listened to the lyrics. He plays his own guitar, and it has to be the single most boring acoustic composition next to Ryan Cabrera. You want acoustic guitar complimenting melancholy voices singing about love? Try Pieces of You by Jewel Kilcher. In my opinion, she should be the only person in the world even allowed to touch an acoustic guitar, so back off Mr. Bland! Sorry, Blunt. Stay away from this album, unless you are too busy staring at the half nude singing lamely on the TV.
0385043805|5.0|I absolutely loved Rebecca! It tends to run on the same dark and brooding notes as books like Dracula, the Haunting and Jane Eyre. That certain something... mystery/excitement/sad empathy for the character in question. Rebecca is a young woman newly married to a man who is twenty years her senior, a man of high position and unspeakable secrets. What more can one ask for?

1579904998|4.0|Dieses Buch war eine meiner vielen Urlaubslekt&uuml;ren und es war genau das, was ich f&uuml;r diesen Fall gesucht habe. Leicht geschrieben, lustig, sympathisch, Lesespass pur. Ein bisschen unrealistisch zwar und das Ende ist ein bisschen kitschig, aber das ist in Wirklichkeit ja genau das, was wir von so einem Buch erwarten ;)<br /><br />Sehr zu empfehlen, wenn man locker leichte Literatur sucht.
B00006FM77|5.0|I know there are lot of you who have issues involving the original mix/master of both the 1995 Chicago Records re-issue, as well as the original 1990 Columbia CD release, such as the \\"kazoo\\"-sounding horn section, in which this remaster cleans up.  <br /> <br />I chose the Chicago Records issue, along with their Group Portrait box set (sadly not reissued/remastered when Rhino picked up the Columbia/Chicago back catalog), and Chicago IX CDs from 1995 (as they all have the same signal level for consistant transfer to Sony MiniDisc), for the purpose of making an expanded version, a true anthology, of this legendary band in their \\"glory years\\" (1968-75, I-IX), in which I will include two tracks (\\"25 or 6 to 4\\", this live version absolutely smokes the studio cut from II, and \\"I'm A Man\\") from this ignored masterpiece as well as tracks from III and XIII (also ignored on Chicago IX) to add onto it.  <br /> <br />Note about the mix, especially the brass section, although that \\"kazoo\\" effect was cleaned up on this remaster, don't forget, this album was recorded in 1971 (yes, 1971!!!), and the legendary Carnegie Hall's acoustics were never conducive to electronic amplification, as one reviewer mentioned, but it is raw, first take, and the way a live album should be, not remixed beyond recognition to the point of it sounding TOO perfect, (although this remaster does improve the mix some bit) but instead one done with passion, heart, and something missing, especially in this day and age of \\"homogenized\\" live albums, which are mostly loaded with overdubbed tracks, \\"crowd noise\\" enhancements, and too-perfect-lip-synced vocals: integrity and respect for their loyal die-hard fans, the music business, and 100% effort in every note played and sung! It's not perfect but it is all real, with none of the enhancements!  <br /> <br />Most bands on today's \\"live\\" albums are simply going through the motions, and not really pouring out their heart and soul into making one, they just simply do it to make money, rather than do it for the fans, who they now resort to gouging out of $25.00 a ticket to see what winds up as garbage, and in agreement with one reviewer, this is the best of the 3 live sets Chicago has recorded. No matter what issue of this album you choose, original or remastered, if you are old-school as both a music fan as well as a musician like me, get this one! Highly recommended! <br /> <br />
0446343129|2.0|I don't usually skim through books, but by chapter two I'd had it with all the extraenous historical information that Dufty seems to think is needed.  All I wanted to know was: why sugar is bad for you, what it does to your body physically and mentally, and what you can do to eliminate this drug from your diet, i.e. food substitutions.  There is a little info on all the above, but you have to search through all the other verbage to find it.  If you are the kind of person that likes to go to flea markets and sort through piles of junk in hopes of finding some little treasure, then you'll probably like this book. Me personally, I don't want to spend the time.  Lets get right to the point.  I came away wondering whether the publisher paid this guy by the word to write this book. Too verbose!!!<br /><br />I've since ordered another book by Gittleman? called 501 ways to eliminate sugar from your diet, which from the reviews I've read, sounds like its more to the point.
1400062756|5.0|I read about Dweck's work in the New York Times, I believe, and then ordered her book, Mindset.  I love this book.  I've bought copies for each of my nieces and nephews and have made it assigned summer reading for my teenage sons. <br />  <br />This is the first time that I've gone \\"gaga\\" over one of these books.  Unlike others, that are terrific at pinpointing the problem and fail at providing a solution, this book has made a real change in my thinking. I've been much more conscious of my \\"fixed\\" thinking since I began reading the book.  Unfortunately, I identify all too well with many of the fixed mindset examples!
0146001133|5.0|For all those who have read the book over and over and fell in love with Mr Rochester himself, this is a must!<br />Timothy Dalton, though too good-looking for the portrait of the stocky, black-haired villain, embodies his chrachter faithfully. He is arrogant, passionate, mysterious. His voice is exactly how you would expect Mr. Rochester to whisper, shout and teaze.<br />Zelah Clark is a fantastic Jane Eyre: subdued and strong-willed a the same time. The first part with Jane Eyre is full of details and follows her misadventures at home and at school.<br />Later at Thornfield Hall there are a couple of masterpiece scenes, such as her farewell before visiting her aunt again or the declarion in the moonlight, that you just have to watch them over and over again.<br />Supporting actors such as those impersonation Richard Mason, StJohn Rivers and his sisters are also very well chosen and effective. Even the laywer at the failed wedding is exactly how you would picture him.<br />It was high time Jane Eyre's readers could watch this version properly, and not torture themselves on the VC and the USA-DVD means.

B000002P2V|2.0|Coming off of an eight-year, six-album winning streak that saw the release of classics The Who Sell Out; Tommy; Live at Leeds; Who's Next and Quadrophenia, as well as the underrated Who By Numbers, this was bound to be a disappointment. Still, the least they could've done is TRIED. New Song might've been more convincing if it weren't for Roger's usual tough-guy vocals that are downright distracting - kinda like the weaker bits on By Numbers, it robs the song of any potential emotion. Sister Disco and the whiny Music Must Change are both pathetic attempts for the Who to sound \\"updated\\"; fillers such as Trick of the Light and Guitar and Pen don't add much.<br /><br />Now, for the good: Each Who album has to have an underrated ballad, and here it's Love Is Coming Down. Entwistle's sci-fi 905 is no classic, but it's okay. And hey, the radio staple title track is pretty cool, a funky little song and the only Who tune I can see somebody dancing to.<br /><br />This was Keith Moon's last album with the Who - he would drink himself to death shortly after the album's release. Rest in peace, you old lunatic. We all miss you!
B0000542D2|5.0|When I finally decided to consider replacing my old MPI VHS tape copy of A Hard Day's Night (MP 1064) with the currently available 2 DVD set, I read the reviews on this listing to see if it was really worth re-buying something I've only occasionally watched over the last twenty or so years.  It's not that I dislike the movie - far from it - It's just that this is one of those movies I can only watch once in a while with interest.  Which only means; it's dated, although in the best possible way.  But I love it, and having it as a VHS cassette rotting on my shelf made no sense, so I looked into the DVD.<br /><br />I knew this was one of the first DVDs released and I've heard some which sound pretty bad, generally due to excessive echo from a careless transfer.  And after reading the reviews here, I was expecting the music to be trash.  (I took the precaution of making a digital recording of the soundtrack of the tape.)  Also screen-cropping was an issue.  I prefer widescreen when I can get it, but if someone actually cut part of the image off, which is what at least one reviewer seemed to be saying, that's catastrophic.  Needless to say, I did approach this DVD with extreme caution.<br /><br />But I was pleasantly surprised at what I found.  As for the sound, my dread turned to relief when I heard that the Beatles' music on this DVD sounds as clean and pure as I could hope, with my only beef being that it is rendered in mono, rather than the \\"hi-fi\\" stereo of the VHS.  But strangely, I found that in this case, mono works better.  Instead of shifting from mono dialogue to stereo music, the DVD is completely mono, which makes for a more consistent viewing experience. For the performance section at the end, I believe a bit more echo was added to make it sound more \\"live.\\"  But as it's all studio tracks anyway, the alteration is somewhat justified and actually does add to the illusion you're listening to the Beatles perform, rather than lip-sync.<br /><br />On the cropping;  This DVD is in widescreen, which admittedly does make the image smaller and harder to see on the small screen.  So why would anyone crop a movie to make it appear widescreen when it'd be better full?  Profit?  (So they could sell us another copy later on.)  Possibly, but for some reason in this instance, I doubted it.  What I did to check was pick an object in the movie close enough to the top of the full screen video that if it were cropped, would certainly not show up on the wide.  I picked the helicopter propeller blades near the end of the movie, when you can see their top, before it takes off.  I found that they were not cropped off on the DVD, although I'll grant it may be that they were closer to the top of the screen.  But this may appear so due to the reduced size of the picture.  In any case, if there is any cropping, it's not obtrusive.<br /><br />So why all the carping?  I'm going to guess because it's not the way you remember it.  Take the fans' word for it, but for my money, the fact that I can actually hear what everyone's saying, plus the interviews, makes the DVD preferable.creen, which admittedly does make the image smaller and harder to see on the small screen.

B000002KCC|5.0|I had to write this after reading the previous review. \\"Tonight's The Night\\" has no point of view, you say? YOU have no powers of perception/discerment, is my (harsh, yes) response. The way the album is produced, played, written (it IS a bit like a great play or movie script, isn't it?) IS the point of view, the songs tell the tale. Depression, despair, sadness, loneliness, anger, regret, it's all here. Not to say it is a downer album, it IS and it ISN'T. Point: When I was an angry young teenager, I'd put on The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\" and it would help release anger, in a non-destructive (except to my hearing, perhaps. Eh, wot?) way. It's the same way with \\"Tonight's The Night\\". When I'm feelin' a bit under the weather, emotionally, I can put this on and it will mirror my feelings, and I sense there is someone else out there who has felt the same way. EVERY song is a keeper (though it took a few listens to get used to), and EVERY song contributes to the \\"theme\\" of the album as a whole, which is \\"it is what it is\\", either you can relate to it, or you can't. I have to think there are an awful lot of people who CAN relate to it, or at least appreciate it from a distance, since it is rightly considered a masterpiece, not only of Neil's, but of rock music in general. If you survived the early '70s and were aware of the \\"youth culture\\" of the time, you certainly know what Neil is singing about. Either you had a friend, or heard about someone, or saw it on TV, or read it in the news, but the utopian dream had faded and the \\"Vietnam Veterans returning home, Nixon's Watergate, etc.\\" reality, the \\"old reality\\" (the one our parents used to live in, you know, before the late '60s, and all that...) was re-asserting itself with a vengeance, and we are in the midst of that type of reality again today. This CD is more relevant than ever, and if you think Buffalo Springfield and CSNY were the best Neil had to offer, you would be wrong, Neil was just gettin' started! Now, when \\"Time Fades Away\\" is re-issued (PLEASE!!! NEIL, I'M BEGGING YOU!!! Release it in an expanded 2 CD set, PLEEEAAAASE! AAARRGH! Yer killin' me! I can't wait forever!!! Save my life, because... \\"Time Fades Away\\"!!! \\"The Bridge, we'll build it Now. It may take A Lot of Time, and it may be lonely, but, ooh babe... the bridge was fallin'...\\") Don't let that bridge fall, Neil! Anyway, (I want to start a web petition about that CD...), \\"Tonight's the Night\\" is the best studio Neil, and \\"Time Fades Away\\" the best live Neil, \\"Rust Never Sleeps, and \\"Live Rust\\" notwithstanding. That is HUGE praise for this album. Neil Young is a premiere artist and this is his brightest (dark) masterpiece!

B00005JKG7|2.0|\\"The Fog\\" is a fairly typical representative of a John Carpenter movie. It certainly has its moments, yet it leaves the viewer with an unmistakable feeling of \\"what might have been.\\" In this sense it reminds me a bit of Michael Mann's 1985 version of F. Paul Wilson's \\"The Keep\\", another fascinating yet flawed horror movie which I watch over and over again in the vain hopes of discovering that it is actually good.<br /><br />Stripped to the bone, \\"The Fog\\" is the story of a small New England fishing town which is about to celebrate its centennial (or bicentennial....or anniversary of some type). On the eve of this occasion the local priest, a drunken sot played by Hal Holbrook, discovers that the town - like all horror movie small towns - has a terrible secret linked to its founding. This discovery coincides with the appearance of a nasty fog off the coast which tends to leave dead people in its wake, and is moving towards the town. Various characters in the town, including a local beer-guzzler (Tom Atkins) a nubile hitch-hiker (Jamie Lee Curtis) a radio deejay (Adrienne Barbeau) and so on, are all isolated by the fog and soon discover what is inside it, and how it is related to the \\"terrible secret\\", an old sin for which the modern-day townsfolk mist pay.<br /><br />As you can see, while the idea is not exactly new it is pretty cool, and when I popped \\"The Fog\\" into my ancient DVD player recently I did so after a hiatus of many years, with the hope that my earlier judgement on the film was wrong. In this I was disappointed. Like \\"The Keep\\", \\"The Fog\\" never gets any better; unlike \\"The Keep\\" it actually gets worse.<br /><br />On paper this should not have happened. Besides Carpenter, who was coming off well-received efforts like \\"Assault on Precinct 13\\" and \\"Halloween\\" there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original \\"Halloween\\" crew. Besides Carptenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, there is also the girl who played Annie (Michael's first onscreen victim), as well as the guy who played the Sheriff in both H and H-2. Replacing the ubiquitous Donald Pleasance is Hal Halbrook, and the venerable John Houseman makes an appearance in the film's opening as a creepy, storytellin' sea captain. Even Janet Leigh is involved, as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a Fog victim. Ironically, tis is part of the film's problem, and it has many.<br /><br />First off, there are far too many characters. The film is cluttered with them and for some reason Carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses. Most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot, and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end. We needed more killings, not less.<br /><br />Second, the performances. This movie has good actors, but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid. The worst of it is ladeled onto Adrienne Barbeau, who gets to repeat idiocies like, \\"My son is trapped! Trapped by the fog!\\" and \\"Look out, into the darkness....and beware of the fog!\\" Gag.<br /><br />Third, the villain(s). Carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film, but he never delivers on it: there is no real payoff. This is because he couldn't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was IN the fog was the actual \\"baddie\\" of the film. The result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges. \\"The Fog\\" might as well be a run o' the mill flood - faceless and impersonal.<br /><br />The movie does have its moments -- the creepy opening, the moments of atmospheric horror at sea, and the excellent cinematography, which is used to particular effect on the creepy fog-dwellers. But in the end these fail to outweigh the movie's many flaws.<br /><br />As of today, I still regard Carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there. On the one hand he gave us P-13, Halloween, Escape from New York, and The Thing, all classics (cult or otherwise). On the other hand he also gave us crap like Prince of Darkness and the unwatchable Ghosts of Mars. In between there are the fun but flawed outings like They Live and In the Mouth of Madness. I would like to say that The Fog falls in this last category, but I really can't. It just isn't very good, and that's the sad fact of it. Bottom line? Beware The Fog.Escape from New York, and The Thing, all classics (cult or otherwise). On the other hand he also gave us crap like Prince of Darkness and the unwatchable Ghosts of Mars.

055321263X|4.0|This advice for writing serial romances, alternately attributed to Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens, and Charles Reade, is epitomized in this 1860 novel by Collins, a story of thwarted love, a marriage of obligation, claims on inheritance, the victimization of women, and, most of all, engaging mystery.  Collins, often credited as the father of the mystery genre, creates a fast-paced story of Victorian England, revealing much about Victorian society and its values--the role of women, the laws governing marriage and inheritance, the social institutions of the day, the contrasting attitudes toward the aristocracy and the lower classes, and even the level of medical care and the treatment of psychological illness.<br /><br />When drawing master Walter Hartright is on his way to teach Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie at Limmeridge House, in Cumberland, England, he meets a \\"woman in white,\\" a young woman who knows Limmeridge House well because she was mentored by Mrs. Fairlie, Laura Fairlie's deceased mother.  The \\"woman in white\\" is Anne Catherick, who looks just like Laura, but who is an escapee from a nearby mental asylum.  Upon his arrival at Limmeridge House, Walter immediately falls in love with the beautiful Laura, but she has made a deathbed pledge to her father to marry to Sir Percival Glyde, someone Anne Catherick despises and blames for her own incarceration.  Throughout the novel, Anne visits various characters to offer help in combating Sir Percival and his cohorts.<br /><br />The story unfolds through documents held by a variety of characters, each of whom tells the story from his/her own point of view.  The reader develops sympathy for the innocent and beautiful Laura, respect for her homely but bright half-sister, Marian Halcombe, sadness for Walter Hartright, and hatred for Sir Percival and his friend, the Italian count Fosco, with whom Sir Percival is in business.  Sir Percival and the count need financing, and it is Laura's inheritance that is at stake.  A series of consecutive disasters, along with arguments, revelations of abuse, the fear of exposure, and the contemplation of murder by Sir Percival and Count Fosco, draws the reader irrevocably into the action.<br /><br />The characters are sympathetically drawn, with Collins showing an early awareness of the influence of psychology on behavior.  The descriptions of nature, presented realistically and in  minute detail, build suspense, as Collins creates parallels between nature and the details of plot.  As is usually the case with romances, chance plays a huge role in the unfolding action, creating cliff-hanging suspense which contributes to the excitement--and pure fun--of this seductive novel.  The conclusion, involving a subplot unrelated to the primary action, resolves issues conveniently.

B000021YQV|4.0|I have recently gotten into SOAD and hard rock in general...years after adolescence.  I feel like these guys are a healthy outlet for my rage against the neo-con right wing direction our poor country seems to be going.  This album's first three songs really pump me up.  For the most part SOAD is not boring repetitive [...] like much of hard rock and generally the lyrics are meaningful with some exceptions.  Serg's powerful voice gives chills at times.

It took my Mom sending me the book while I was passing time in the desert in Kuwait, waiting for my year-long deployment to end (the clock is still counting).  Well, I finally picked it up one day and started reading.  That decision was the best one I made in the long month of January.<br /><br />Pi Patel's story kept me up late, and reading with every spare opportunity I could find.  The book has a number of 'phases': foray into religion, the initial weeks on the boat and lost at sea, and the final courage to survive.  Each portion of the book is well crafted and ties into the others seamlessly.  I can easily see how \\"Life of Pi\\" is recommended for both adolescents and adults; the reader is forced to think in new ways, and is inspired while doing so.

B0001EYT2A|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see this movie the first time in 1968, in a drive-in theater.  It seemed to me to be an epic, complex western, and perhaps the best movie I had ever seen in my life at that time.  This movie is epic, it is complex, and is certainly one of the best westerns ever made.<br /><br />Sergio Leone made this movie at a time when Italian movie-makers were known for their intensely artistic visions.  Sergio keeps his movie sufficiently within the mainstream so that the movie is very accessible, yet there are numerous artistic elements, including symbolism and film angles that were intended to be artistic, and turned out to be incredibly evocative and beautiful cinematography.<br /><br />Before proceeding with this review, I should mention the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morricone.  The music enhances each situation beautifully, and is one of the best soundtracks for a western of all time.  The signature song with the predominant drum and vocal is unforgettable, and perfectly formed to each scene in which it is used.<br /><br />The story takes place during the Civil War.  Clint Eastwood is essentially a con artist, turning in Eli Wallach for a reward, and then saving him by shooting the hangman's rope at just the right moment.  Clint and Eli have a falling out and the two separate.  Clint finds a new partner and is in the process of saving him when Eli runs into him.  Eli wants a little revenge on Clint, and is torturing him by walking him through the desert when they stumble on a wagon full of dead Confederate soldiers; except one is still alive.  The dying soldier tells Clint where $200,000 in gold is buried and then dies.  Suddenly Eli has to keep Clint alive.  The search for the gold is the true story to this movie, though it takes a significant portion of the movie to discover this plot.  The beginning of the movie to the start of the search for the gold is used to introduce each of the main characters and to establish their personality.<br /><br />This movie is full of highly detailed and complex scenes, each of which is a mini-story in its own right.  Perhaps the most memorable portions of the movie occur near the end.  In one scene, Confederate and Union soldiers are dying endlessly and pointlessly over a bridge that neither side can seem to capture.  The Union captain would love to see the bridge destroyed to stop the endless and pointless killing, but he is under orders to take the bridge intact.  Given the violence of this movie, it is ironic that this entire scene is about the futility of war.<br /><br />In a subsequent scene, Clint Eastwood finds a dying Confederate soldier and comforts him, covering him to keep him warm and sharing a cigarette.  Clint looks away to see Eli Wallach riding off on a horse, and the soldier dies.  The scene visually illustrates how fleeting life is.<br /><br />The final scene is classic western combined with Sergio Leone's masterful artistic touch.  The three principal characters meet in a graveyard where the gold is supposedly buried.  The confusion of Tuco (Eli Wallach) as he searches for the grave is illustrated visually.  The background music is eliminated in favor of natural outdoor noise for portions of this scene as the three principal characters participate in a dramatic three-way gunfight.<br /><br />Even with this scene, Sergio Leone was not quite done.  He had an afterward that reflects on how the movie began.  The ending is Sergio's impression of the classic American western, with a man riding off into the hills and theme music accompanying him, with soaring camera angles to illustrate the western ideal of independence and self-reliance and the American theme of individualism.<br /><br />You need not understand the artistic elements of this movie to be able to appreciate it.  You will sense the elements are there, if only subconsciously, and you will realize that this is a wonderful and great movie.  This movie is one you will want to see again and again,especially if you are a fan of westerns or epic movies.

B000CNFC76|5.0|I've now watched this movie three times: twice when it was in the theatres and once at home on DVD. I rarely give a movie a \\"10\\" on a 10-point scale but they simply do not make movies better than this. Everything about it from start to finish is first-rate and the values it extols are all quintessentially American: courage, sportsmanship, integrity, opportunity, achievement through sheer talent and perseverance. I cannot recommend it too highly. It is a classic for all time.
B00005YUNY|5.0|If you're a Yes fan and appreciate the epics from the seventies along with most of the other music from this period you'll probably love Yes Symphonic. Even though you don't hear the sound of the orchestra very much they put the music on another level making songs like Close To The Edge, Gates Of Delirium, And You And I, and Ritual sound both spectacular and emotional in a new way.   <br /> <br />I've had this DVD for several years and I never get tired of of it. It's not as rocky as the the band was in the eighties and I guess many fans appreciate that. It's just a music experience for progressive music fans with the music in focus.
0393327655|3.0|I started this book with great enthusiasm. Harris issued a clear call to sweep away all the stale conceptions about religion and its basic goodness, and instead acknowledge that religious moderates are propping up dangerous ideas. <br />Then the book digresses into a long section about ... Well, that's just it. It was something about faith and what it is and isn't. <br />Then there's an interesting bit about issues particular to the Muslim faith. Then a watered-down section about problems with the Christian faith and then ... Another problem. All of a sudden we're reading about the drug war. <br />The last couple chapters, something about rational ethics is probably fascinating for a philosophy major, but impenetrable for the layperson. <br />The basic thesis is interesting, but this could have been a long \\"New York Times Magazine\\" or \\"New Yorker\\" article. <br />Check it out from the library.

B000AP04OM|5.0|It's downright sacrilegious to say anything critical of this 1965 musical classic, and I have to admit I still love the movie like almost everyone else I know. Between the postcard-perfect Austrian scenery captured by Ted D. McCord's vibrant cinematography and the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein score, it's an irresistible entertainment with Julie Andrews ideally realizing the role of Maria, the young Salzburg novitiate nun who may be too independent to become part of the order. She is assigned by the abbey's Mother Superior to become a governess for the seven mischievous children of retired Navy Captain Von Trapp. The rest of the plot focuses on the burgeoning love that develops not only between Maria and the Captain but also between the two principals and the children.<br /><br />A romantic triangle arises in the form of a Baroness who has her talons in the Captain until she realizes she cannot manipulate the inevitable, but the bigger conflict comes with the encroaching Nazi regime who attempts to strong-arm Von Trapp to serve in the Reich. A closer examination of the 174-minute movie really shows an odd imbalance to the narrative. The lighter first half is all told from Maria's perspective, and consequently, this is where most of the memorable songs are performed. After the intermission, Maria is pushed to the background when the Captain becomes engaged to the Baroness and then later when things heat up between him and the Nazi officials. Even though the story makes sense as presented, I've always thought this strange given the build-up of the story as Maria's personal odyssey.<br /><br />But no matter as the songs are beautifully staged and choreographed by Mark Breaux and Dee Dee Wood, in particular, the joyous Salzburg montage used for \\"Do Re Mi\\", the unintended slumber party for \\"My Favorite Things\\", the simplicity of the Captain's rendition of \\"Edelweiss\\", the gauzy gazebo duet \\"Something Good\\", the puppy love pas-de-deux in the same gazebo of \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" and of course, the how-can-it-be-topped opening title song. Besides the transcendent Andrews (is it a wonder why we all fell in love with her back then?), Christopher Plummer is far more dimensional as Von Trapp than I remember from my youth. Not only does he capture the sternness, but he brings a saucy sense of humor and fey quality to his performance. Looking regal the way Hollywood stars used to, Eleanor Parker plays the Baroness not so much as a vindictive man-handler but more as an insecure woman too comfortable with her exalted status in life.<br /><br />In stock roles, Richard Haydn provides comic relief as the cagey impresario Max, while as Rolfe, Daniel Truhitte transforms from smitten bike messenger to cold Nazi youth in record time. As the Mother Superior, Peggy Wood brings calming assurance, though her dubbed performance of \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\" is a tad too operatic for the movie's tone. The children are all well played, though I tend to think of Charmian Carr as a bit too Ann-Margret-kittenish as Liesl, especially as her singing voice does not sound remotely Tyrolean. Minor flaws aside, major credit should be given to director Robert Wise, who already performed similar chores on \\"West Side Story\\" and has somehow mastered the art of pacing such a marathon musical story. Wise's frequent collaborator, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, adapted the original stage book by Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse with wit and heart and manages to tone down the innately saccharine tone of the story.<br /><br />The 2005 40th anniversary two-disc DVD package is obscenely full of extras which should satisfy the most persnickety aficionado. Still looking great at 70, Andrews provides brief introductions to both discs. First things first, the 2005 restoration effort and the transfer on the DVD have yielded a superb print, and it will not disappoint any fan of the movie. There are two commentary tracks, one done by Wise in a rather perfunctory fashion, the othera more anecdotal account by Andrews, Carr, Dee Dee Wood and the real Maria Von Trapp's youngest son Johannes. Then there is a very informative, 63-minute making-of documentary produced for the new DVD, \\"My Favorite Things: Julie Andrews Remembers\\" which thoroughly discusses the history of the Von Trapp family, the Broadway incarnation and the complicated transfer of the stage show to screen - even though a number of participants provide recollections, not just Andrews.<br /><br />There are also two charming looking-back interview sessions. The first is a 20-minute conversation between Andrews and an especially acerbic Plummer, who seems to be ridiculing the original Maria in the Broadway version, stage legend Mary Martin, for her reputed megalomania. The second is a 33-minute group discussion among the seven actors who portrayed the Von Trapp children, all looking decidedly middle-aged (their ages now ranging from 47 to 62) and showing a friendly compatibility with one another in their remembrances. There is also a 22-minute featurette showing Carr revisiting the Salzburg locations, providing a history of the city and even joining in on The Sound of Music bus tour (I've done that one, too).<br /><br />Another short focuses on the current phenomenon of the sing-along screenings of the movie, this one a massive event at the Hollywood Bowl complete with extravagantly costumed viewers. Also included are a fascinating A&E Biography special of the real Von Trapps, a text-driven demonstration of the restoration process, and a real howler - scratchy screen test footage of an 18-year old Mia Farrow sounding particularly tone-deaf in her audition as Liesl (I only wish they had similar footage for others who auditioned like Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell and the Osmond Brothers). Lastly, there are a number of trailers and an exhaustive photo gallery. Whew. This really defines what a complete DVD package is all about, and in this case, it's perfectly justifiable.rews, Carr, Dee Dee Wood and the real Maria Von Trapp's youngest son Johannes.

B00005J6T1|3.0|The Burning Up version here (3.45) is not the original vinyl album mix (4.48), and yet it's not listed as a radio edit, either original or new. This short mix (speeded up and edited?) is a \\"wham, bam, thank you ma'am\\" kind of tune. I like it, but prefer the slower burn of the original album version. <br />Why doesn't the record company tell you what they've done? Why not include the original as well, with space not an issue? Maybe because, judging by all the reviews here, nobody notices. <br />But the cover should really say, \\"Remastered (and a bit different to what you originally bought and liked)\\". <br /> <br /> <br />

B000002G7E|5.0|From my side of the fence, this is the best of the official releases of VU. It is artistically and musically way ahead of its time and has stood as a school by itself. Seems like it still stands. <br /> <br />You know, lately I heard a tape of This Heat, another groundbreaker, live in 1978, and the guitar used there is exactly equal in sound to the one bursting through on this album. Also the arrangements here are noteworthy. If it stood as an inspiration for Throbbing Gristle rather than Sex Pistols is up to each one to tell. But of a certain; without White Light/White Heat much of the stuff people like these days wouldn't sound like it do. <br /> <br />And as for the heroin and some of the lyrics and stuff, yea, I agree, not too good, I hate them junk too. But try to get across from that and have some insight about Reed in New York in these years and start to see this piece as it should be seen: art or at least as part of [essential] musical history.

B00005A0V0|4.0|I like Caravan, I like stuff like Camel too. But, they don't leave you too impressed, not even bothered, it doesn't engrave itself within. Caravan makes nice little pittoresque and undisturbing prog pieces. That's about it. They are neat, cute, good, smart, musically interesting - but not too daring or substantial. And not essential. <br /> <br />I recall in the 70s when a neighbour girl came home after her flute lessons and played small pieces together with her brother on piano and then their mum used to drum along with bongos and tambourine. It was nice, really, but as a musical experience it just makes you long for the real thing. Yngwie Malmstrom is not a heavy metal artist, he's just a guy who loves to play the guitar, especially the scales. <br /> <br />Caravan's Land of Grey & Pink is needed, I don't deny that, get the album to your collection. But as for Caravan generally speaking you might just proceed to Hatfield and the North at once even though I would go a step further to Egg and the like. <br /> <br />It's ok, I don't expect you to agree. <br />

0805211063|5.0|The Castle is one of those books that forever changes your literary perspective. Kafka's absurd storyline coupled with his predernatural prose and comic genius make for a very entertaining novel. Perhaps the most fascinating part of this book is how fresh and timely it remains. The Castle comments on the utter despair an outsider suffers when confronted with the bureaucratic and totalitarianism regime of a foreign land. Perhaps the most tremendous aspect of this book is relating to the main character K and feeling so utterly hopeful and in turn destitute as he does. Although the book does not exactly have an ending, the price we pay for Kafka's genius is his failure to complete works. I recommend this translation because it seems to capture the essence of Kafka's message. If you've read The Trial or any of Kafka's short stories and enjoyed them, this book is for you. If you've never read Kafka, this book is for you too.

B000CNFC76|4.0|I, for one, am not a fan of golf and with some reservation sat down and watched this with my kid.<br /><br />It is a story of a young golfer rising up from his modest upbringing and coming to success as a top amateur golfer, competing with the pros in the US Open.<br /><br />The cinematography is unique, using special effects to explain the pro golfer view of concentration on the game, of the pressure on the green and other aspects of the game.<br /><br />You need to know a little about the game to understand some finer points, but they do not insult you by injecting lame explanations.<br /><br />It sticks to the story and is engaging enough, without sex, violence, vulgar language, excessive CG or other effects, and for a movie released today that is quite a feat.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|This was really a good movie from both sides of the debate. Even I couldn't really tell what the end result was. I'd call myself a believer, and I could entirely believe in the possession of people by real demons, not just mental ones. Still, this was a very smartly done movie that made sure you were suffeciently freaked out and then made you feel stupid for being freaked out at all. Everything has a perfectly rational explination.<br /><br />Except 3:00am. All I care about for that time is if I'm lonely. Or so says Rob Thomas.
0553296981|1.0|This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. I have neither found the carm of it or the point of the book. Firstly, this book does not really show or deal with the Holocaust. It is about a girl who is growing up! Being the age of fourteen I have not been able to relate to her in any which way.Secondly, the book is very boring. She goes on endlessly about her bordemn and the fights that happen in the Annex. Lastly, it does not really share anything historical about the Hollocaust except for the idea of hiding. Overall I found this book pointless and very irrelevent. I have read much better books sbout the Holocaust that deal with many historical events. If you really want to learn more about the Holocaust I would recommend For Freedom:The story of a French Spy and Number the Stars.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|If one is not a fan of the book or the A&E/BBC mini-series version of P&P, then this movie might be enjoyable.  However, that being said, this movie is a poorly done version of a classic novel.   <br /> <br />Here are my problems with the film: <br />1.  Character butchering.  Mr. Bingley was portrayed as a moron in this \\"adaption\\" of the novel.  Mr. Bingley was never stupid or insipid.  The relationship b/w Mr. and Mrs. Bennett-as  lovely-dovely when in fact, Mr. Bennett could barely tolerate Mrs. Bennett and her silliness.  <br /> <br />2. The lack of chemistry or build up for the relationship of Darcy and Elizabeth.  There was very little interaction b/w Lizzy and Darcy that would even suggest a reason why either would love each other.  It was quite sudden with absolutely no explanation.  <br /> <br />3. The Bennetts were not poor, as Mr. Bennett was a gentleman, not a field hand.  The Bennett house looked like a common persons home with pigs and animals walking in and out if it as it that was not unusal.  Additionally, the Bennett girls, especially Lizzy were always unkept and untidy.  Daughters of a gentleman do not look like rag-a-muffins. Lizzy's hair was always undone and coming out.  <br /> <br />4.  The confrontation b/w Elizabeth and Lady Catherine was extremely contrived.  Lady Catherine would never visit Elizabeth that late at night.  Judy Dench did an admirable job with Lady Catherine, however, the character was written poorly. <br /> <br />Overall, this movie was barely tolerable.  It did not deserve any of the accolades it received, esp, the Oscar nomination for Ms. Knightley.  <br /> <br />If you are a true fan of the novel, watch the BBC mini-series, as it captures the true spirit and essence of the book.  <br /> <br />

B000E6GBV2|5.0|The importance of having friends with good taste comes home to roost. How long would have it taken me otherwise to find out about such a great album? Band of Horses takes 36 minutes to create a perfect album with no song too short and no song too long. It's almost like they heard \\"It Still Moves\\" by My Morning Jacket and said \\"Not bad, but we could do it much better and quicker\\" and they wouldn't be lying.<br /><br />Taking nothing away from MMJ and It Still Moves which was a fantastic album, but It Still Moves wasn't exactly a lesson in brevity. Band of Horses borrows a small page from MMJ's overall sound but makes an entirely new and fantastic package. This is one album that requires no second guessing of track selection, location, etc. You just put it on and let it go. The cd player will do the rest.<br /><br />A great album through and through. It's certainly a sound for sore ears as I eagerly awaited my favorite new spring time CD. This is it, enjoy!
0805209999|5.0|What startled me as I read this new translation, 20 years after reading the older one, is irony and humor Kafka suffused in his paranoid narrative. The Trial is my favorite piece of Kafka's fiction, including his shorter works, because it deals with a social reality and not metaphysical metaphor.<br /><br />The farcical social reality reminds me of Thomas Berger's novels, especially Neighbors, Meeting Evil, and The Houseguest. If you want to read \\"Kafkaesque\\" fiction with a light touch set in contemporary America, check out those Berger masterpieces.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|2005 was quite a year for Ryan.  He recorded 3 albums, 2 of which were considered brilliant by most, 1 of which (29) got more mixed reviews.  I don't understand why the world at large has failed to hail \\"29\\" as the fantastic album that I believe it is, but at least pretty much everyone can agree that Cold Roses is magnificent. <br /> <br />Cold Roses picks up on territory that lies somewhere in between Heartbreaker and Gold.  Roots country is evident as an influence everywhere, although much of the album is not necessarily alt-country in style.  Once more, Ryan has shown maturity both in his guitar style as well as his singing voice, which is in fine form. <br /> <br />The album boasts a number of strong cuts, notably the  magnificent \\"Let it Ride\\", \\"Magnolia Mountain\\", and \\"Friends\\".  There are few missteps on the album, which is uniformly enjoyable.  Even the weaker tracks will have you humming along and tapping your toes.  If you are a Ryan fan, this album is a must.  If you are new to Ryan Adams, this is possibly one of the best albums with which to start--it has a great selection of instantly memorable tunes, good singing, and plays to his strengths.   <br /> <br />People complain that Ryan releases too much.  I say Bravo, Ryan.  What a find we have in him that someone so talented will show us so many sides of himself.

B0000AI45P|5.0|Rhino has done it again; what a brilliant job of remastering as the sound quality of this disc is remarkable.  Born of the same stock as bands like Blondie, the Ramones, Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground, Bowie, The Cars and The Knack, Television has something unique about their sound that is very addictive and has an edge about it that makes you want to listen to them over and over.<br /><br />The licks and riffs they play are deceptively simple cliches and yet they pull it off brilliantly.  Not a single weak track here and the bonus tracks in this case add to the overall listening experience unlike in many other cases where they may even detract from the quality of the original album.<br /><br />This digipak version also comes with all the lyrics printed on the inner covers and a 20-page booklet with great liner notes as well.  The only down side is that the cd does not come with a protective plastic or paper sleeve and the disc is stored between cardboard surfaces which makes it very hard to prevent scratches.<br /><br />Tom Verlaine has a truly unique voice and the rest of the band do very competent work making this one of the best ever debut albums.  If you absolutely have to categorise this, it would very loosely fit into the punk rock category but that would not quite do justice in describing the band.  The closest I can think of is that they fall in-between early David Bowie and The Cars.  A happier version of the former but a darker version of the latter but still essential listening for all music lovers.  Highly recommended.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer's debut album, \\"Reign in Blood\\" is considered by most metalist to be one of the finest thrash metal albums of our time, and I can easily agreed that it is.

The guitar work on this album is just mind-boggling, sounding more like grindcore more then death metal, King and Hanneman just cram as many killer riffs into every song, then spontanously breaking out into insane, inhuman solos. Lombardo's drumming in great, overall this is a showcase of premier musicanship. Araya's vocals sound perfect amist the shreading fray of guitars and drumming, I couldn't really imagine this album with the retarded \\"cookie monster\\" vocals most death metal bands use nowadays, and his voice is very original and memorable. As he rants on about Doctor Mengele, insane killing sprees and Satanic sacrifices upon blood-drenched altars down in the deepest, most firey pits of hell. The songs are fairly short, usually ending around the two and 1/2 minute mark, making it seem even more akin to grindcore then death metal. The original release was only around twenty minutes long, but the new extended edition contains two new songs, which are good, but don't go with the flow of the orginal album at all. If you are just discovering REAL metal, this is a great place to start, highly recommended. <br /> <br />Favorite track - \\"Altar of Sacrifice\\"
B00005ASHM|3.0|I happened to be around in 1966. I think I was 12 and I remember finding this album for 25 cents in a thrift shop like a year after it came out! It was not a popular album for the Beach Boys. Fans didn't like it. No &#34;I get Around&#34;. No car songs. Corny album cover. I thought then they were washed up. Didn't notice them again until &#34;Do It Again&#34; came out. Then &#34;Good Vibrations&#34; and finally &#34;Kokomo&#34;.  I decided to get &#34;Pet Sounds&#34; again after all those years just to see why now days so many think this is the greatest album ever made. Was there something I missed years ago?  Verdict:   As far as my ears can tell, there are 3 great songs on this: &#34;Don't talk&#34; (put your head on my shoulder), &#34;God Only Knows&#34; and &#34;Wouldn't It Be Nice&#34;.  &#34;Pet Sounds&#34; may have generated a couple ideas for the Beatles but sorry, it's not even close to &#34;Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&#34;, or &#34;Dark Side Of The Moon&#34; where every song is great and every song flows perfectly into the next.  &#34;Pet Sounds&#34; was really a Brian Wilson experiment where he tried using Phil Spector's wall of sound and tried to make a concept album similar to &#34;Rubber Soul&#34;.  In my opinion, he missed the mark.  It's worth an occasional listing to but not sure why so many think this is the greatest album ever made.
B000E5KUK6|4.0|First things first, if you are a massive fan of the Japanese Godzilla and are expecting to see a kickass CGI version of the classic tale, then this movie is not for you.  This movie has basically nothing to do with the original except for the idea of a giant lizard tearing cities apart. <br /> <br />But this is not a bad thing.  This movie is an enjoyable monster-flick with good CGI and half-decent story (nothing amazing, but really not that bad), and you will enjoy it if you like monster movies and do not compare it to the Japanese original.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|What can I say about this incredible film?  The music is phenominal; the actors are superb; and the story, well, what's not to LOVE about a \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" plot?  What makes this movie so incredibly heart-wrenching, is how utterly lonely the Phantom is and always was.  It tears your heart out.  I've seen this over and over again, and each time I watch it, I get even more out of it.  I listen to the CD in my car, and I can visualize the whole movie.  As talented as they both are, Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman are just too over-the-top with their characters, but then, that's the stage for you.  This movie version drills deep into your soul - something you could never get on the stage.  To you, Joel Schumaker and Andrew Lloyd Webber, I applaud you:  \\"Brava!  Bravisima!\\"
B000BQ7J70|5.0|Wer aus Neugier nur den ersten Band der Harry Potter Reihe liest oder nur den ersten Film sieht, erliegt zwangsl&auml;ufig einer v&ouml;llig falschen Vorstellung von Rowlings genialer Arbeit. Warum?<br /><br />Nun, erst im zweiten Band wird pl&ouml;tzlich den LeserInnen deutlich gemacht, worum es dem dunklen Zauberer Voldemort eigentlich geht. Im ersten Teil k&ouml;nnte der Eindruck eines typischen \\"B&ouml;sen\\" entstehen, der warum auch immer nach der Weltherrschaft d&uuml;rstet. Jetzt tut sich bei sehr aufmerksamen Lesen (!) der wirkliche Schrecken Voldemorts auf: Er will \\"Rassenreinheit\\", was in diesem Fall hei&szlig;t, die Ausl&ouml;schung aller Nicht-Reinbl&uuml;tigen Zauberer, die er abwertend \\"Schlammbl&uuml;ter\\" nennt. Ein Riesengefahr f&uuml;r Harrys Freundin Hermione und andere Sch&uuml;ler! In einem Interview mit der Frankfurter Rundschau verr&auml;t Rowling, da&szlig; Voldemort eine Hitler-Figur ist und damit das f&uuml;r sie absolut B&ouml;se. Die N&auml;he zum faschistischen Regime setzt Rowling auch durch subtile Anspielungen in diesem Band: Die Kammer des Schreckens wurde das erste Mal 1942 ge&ouml;ffnet, exact zur gleichen Zeit, in der die Wannsee-Konferenz stattfand, die &uuml;ber die \\"Endl&ouml;sung\\" bez&uuml;glich der \\"Judenfrage\\" entschied. &Auml;hnlich wie Hitler erf&uuml;llt auch Voldemort seine eigenen Anforderungen nicht: Hitler war nicht blond und blau&auml;ugig, Voldemorts Vater war kein Zauberer! Auch Voldemort stellt sich als \\"F&uuml;hrer\\" &uuml;ber seine Anh&auml;nger. Auch Voldemort schreckt nicht vor Morden zur&uuml;ck und zuckt nur kalt die Schultern &uuml;ber den Tod unschuldiger Menschen. (\\"Abschaum!\\")<br /><br />Wer mag da noch behaupten, da&szlig; Harry Potter nur Fantasy ist? Nur Unterhaltung f&uuml;r Kinder?<br /><br />Sicher ist die gro&szlig;e Beachtung, die dieser Reihe entgegengebracht wird, verdient. Rowling zeichnet nicht nur &uuml;berzeugend vielschichtige Charaktere, niemand ist halt \\"nur\\" gut oder b&ouml;se, sie leugnet auch die dunklere Seite in uns allen, unseren Schatten nach C.G. Jung, nicht, die zu menschlichen Katastophen wie Rassismus bis hin zum Genozid f&uuml;hren kann.<br /><br />Ein dicker Brocken, sicher. Aber Rowling schafft den Balanceakt zwischen moralischer Botschaft und spannender Unterhaltung so perfekt, da&szlig; man das Buch auch einfach gebannt verschlingen kann, ohne die versteckten Zeichen mitzulesen.<br /><br />Wer also meint, dieser Band sei weniger aufregend als der Rest der Reihe, mag f&uuml;r sich selbst Recht haben. Dar&uuml;ber denkt halt jeder anders.<br /><br />Zweifellos ist dieser Band aber gesamtthematisch der entscheidende in der Reihe: Voldemort ist nicht einfach ein \\"Baddie\\", Voldemort ist ein &uuml;bler, gef&auml;hrlicher Faschist.nozid führen kann.  <br /> <br />Ein dicker Brocken, sicher.

B0000844MS|4.0|I saw this movie when I was a kid in the 80s and it was one of my favorites at the time and I still really enjoy now in my 20s.  There is something magical about watching Labyrinth. You just feel the happiness that rubs off from this movie. It almost makes you wish you were a kid again.  I am not even a David Bowie fan but I can't help but smile whenever he starts singing (which is quite often). What is fantastic about the way the film opens and closes as that it really hints to the fact that Sarah has been through the same dream before, and that she needs these imaginative friends, and dreams to help her see the light as it were.  This film is great, it is what makes, or made fantasy films of this time really enchanting. Real artistry was involved, there was exuberance and charm to it and it has lasted a long time. It is a firm fans favourite and still gains new young fans. I can still to this day sit down and enjoy the film because I remember what Jim Henson tries to teach us. `Keep the inner child alive inside you sometimes he/she actually knows best'.  Overall this is a classic fantasy film with much artistry and charm to appreciate, certainly Henson had a skill in all his fields in the industry.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|this movie is my absolute favorite. i watched it in theatres more than 4 times and my best friend pre-purchased the DVD for me for my birthday. just to mention but i completely adored the alternate ending. i really dont understand why they didn't use that ending. besides that, the movie was sensational.
B00003CXC7|4.0|I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie because I had seen Vertigo and I really didn't like the casting choice of James Stewart.  But I'm on a bit of a Hitchcock thing right now and want to see all of his films.  One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie, bar a couple of brief scenes, is set in the apartment.  The obvious twists Mr. Hitchcock could have delivered upon us are never used. Perhaps we would have found out that in fact the neighbor's wife was alive, but that the neighbor was in fact involved in a crime. What was buried in the garden? The stolen jewel perhaps? No, We never really find out, they just elude to the mysterious treasure and we are left to assume it is just another cut up bit of wife.  Over all the story wasn't all that bad, it does pull you along, and it keeps you watching. But, admittedly a large part of that is because the viewer is left expecting one of those supposedly famous \\"Hitchcock Twists\\", but with a rushed and unimaginative ending, the twist never comes.  What intrigued me is that we can witness Stewart's voyeurism, taking the journey with him from curiosity to suspicion to certainty to fear, finally subconsciously delighting in becoming voyeurs ourselves.  I actually caught myself sitting up on the edge of my couch near the end of this movie.

Not all guys fit into this mold, so take this with a grain of salt and a good laugh. <br /> <br />It seems as if this \\"Sex and the City\\" catchphrase has gone on too long, and Behrendt's 15 minutes should be over soon.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Honestly this is a lesson to Hollywood. If you want to give a film a bit of piece de resistance, then include British actors and a British director. <br /> <br />Batman was a joke.  <br /> <br />It's now a work of art.  <br /> <br />

0780622553|5.0|I typically never read movie reviews because they almost always give away too much of the plot and I'm very anal about screening a flick free of preconceptions and unnecessary influences; therefore I will refrain from discussing the movie in detail. But since the opening monologue goes right into describing the ancient race of beings featured in this movie, it doesn't hurt to say that these are possibly the most impressive aliens I've ever seen on screen. They truly look as if they exist in another dimension of reality. I'm sick to death of humanoid-like aliens and these creatures are far from human - far from anything I've ever seen really, only vaguely resembling earthly insects or amphibians. If you love science fiction, this DVD is a must.<br /><br />I confess that my main motivation for writing today is to spew my dismay and frustration about the fact that William Hurt is a movie star. I don't know how he did it, but one of the worst actors of all time has somehow convinced Hollywood that he has talent. Apparently, people do way too many drugs in Hollywood. Way back when, I liked Hurt in BODY HEAT, thinking he played a pretty good pretty boy/dupe, in kinda the same way I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger did a pretty good acting job as a robot in THE TERMINATOR (only to realize from subsequent films that he always acted that way).<br /><br />I'll admit I was duped by William Hurt too for many years, mainly due to my youthful ignorance, but I eventually came to realize that William Hurt always played William Hurt with his robotic mannerisms, hopelessly stilted manner of speaking and utter inability to connect with his character or convincingly interact with other actors. Yet Hurt is routinely praised by the likes of idiot reviewer Roger Egbert (whose pompous, look-how-smart-and-important-I-am commentary track here should definitely be skipped). Painfully bad movies (thanks largely to Hurt) like THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST are bafflingly considered to be good. Thank goodness his poor acting skills don't detract too much from DARK CITY which is much more of a special-effects showcase than an acting one, although main character Rufus Sewell is good.<br /><br />Take a good look at William Hurt people - this emperor wears no clothes! Someone give this guy  a Raspberry award for lifetime achievement in bad acting.goodness his poor acting skills don't detract too much from DARK CITY which is much more of a special-effects showcase than an acting one, although main character Rufus Sewell is good. <br /> <br />Take a good look at William Hurt people - this emperor wears no clothes!

B000062YAZ|1.0|Even when I was a huge thrash fan when I was in my late teens, I never found Slayer's music to be particularly interesting or inventive.  Sure they're fast and heavy...but so what?  Almost every single song on here is interchangeable and has no life of its own.  The strongest aspect of the album is Rick Rubin's impeccable production.    There are three basic types of Slayer songs on their albums: death, insanity, and murder.  That's it.  That wouldn't be so bad if there was some DEPTH to their lyrics.  Unfortunately, there is absolutely no depth to be found here.      My recommendation is to download Angel of Death.  Once you've heard it, you've heard the whole album.  Hell you've heard Slayer's whole career.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|This CD has the feel and sound from the Animals CD. It's very relaxing but I think I was expecting more solo stuff from David. Oh well it's still great to hear something new, even if it's not new Floyd.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Many reviews find fault with the historical inaccuracies.  Others find fault with the stereotypical, PC portrayal of the Crusades - the evil, fanatical Christians who are closed minded and seek only to impose their will on others.  Still more fault the acting and Orlando Bloom's inability to play the lead in a serious film that attempts to deal with weighty moral issues.  The supporting cast continuously upstages him.  Then we have others that state it was just plain boring, the purpose of the story lost in a convoluted mess of political intrigue.  Don't get me wrong.  To an extent, I understand each of these points and appreciate them for what they are: other people's opinions.  Here is mine: <br /> <br />Admittedly, some of the historical errors are laughable ... such as Guy de Lusignan wearing the cross of the Knights Templar.  Since those men were avowed celibates, then I don't believe his marriage to Sibylla would have been possible.  Okay, so the inaccuracies are a valid point, whether they were glaringly obvious or small and noticeable only to historians knowledgeable on the subject.  But if anyone walked into this movie actually expecting a history lesson, then you should be watching a presentation on the History Channel or reading a book written by one of the leading professors on the subject such as Jonathan Riley-Smith.  Take it for what it is: a fictionalized, Hollywood interpretation of the Crusades.  Yes, maybe more effort should have been paid to detail, but I'm not going to worry overmuch about it as, once again, this is Hollywood.  Since when do we expect a historically accurate account? <br /> <br />As for the politically correct aspect ... well, I admit it gets a little repetitious and perhaps nauseating.  Heaven forbid we actually show history the way it was.  We might offend someone.  So, here we go again with the stereotypical pill everyone seems able to swallow without much complaining: the evil, fanatical, white, Christian male whose only goal in life is supremacy and whose only drive is greed.  But again, it's Hollywood.  No one should've walked into this movie expecting anything but a politically correct rendition of the Crusades. <br /> <br />As for Orlando Bloom ... well, not really the guy for the part.  I was more interested in the supporting cast than Bloom's character Balian.  It was partly because Bloom wasn't given much to work with.  Throughout the movie I found myself confused by Balian's character - his drive and purpose.  By the end, I still didn't feel as if I really knew him.  Then, it was partly because Bloom, from what I - and the whole world - have seen him in previously (LOTR, Pirates of the Caribbean, Troy), excels in supporting roles.  I still have my doubts that he's leading man material.  Bloom is constantly outshined by the supporting cast, most notably Edward Norton as King Baldwin IV, Jeremy Irons as Tiberias, Liam Neeson as Godfrey, and Ghasson Massoud as Saladin.  Personal opinion is, acting wise, Norton stole the movie as the masked Leper King, only appearing in maybe six scenes ... one of which I found to be the most remarkable scene in the entire movie - that being when Baldwin rides out to meet Saladin at Kerak and the subsequent scene when Baldwin confronts Reynald de Chatillon.   <br /> <br />As for the story itself, I did find it to be slow at the beginning.  It took awhile for it to get interesting - nearly forty-five minutes, at which point Norton was introduced as Baldwin, and I was hooked.  So again, I refer to the power of the supporting cast and not Bloom to drive the story.  The plot, in a nutshell, is an attempt by Ridley Scott to tell the \\"true\\" story of Balian of Ibelin, the man responsible for the defense of Jerusalem against Saladin.  Aside from Balian defending Jerusalem, not much else of the character is based on historical fact.  But again, it's only a movie.  It begins with Godfrey of Ibelin searching for his son, born out of wedlock.  Thus, we find our hero Balian grieving the loss of his wife who committed suicide after the death of their child.  She is condemned to hell for the sin of self-murder, and Godfrey convinces Balian to come with him to Jerusalem where he might find peace and work to save his wife's soul.  Balian, a mere blacksmith, suddenly becomes a competent swordsman after seemingly one lesson from his father.  Balian returns to the Holy Land and is confronted by the political intrigue of the Christian court.  Despite his apparent desire to become a \\"perfect knight\\" and find salvation for his soul and his wife's, Balian commits the sin of adultery by having an affair with Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla (Eva Green in an engaging if not stellar performance) who is married to Guy de Lusignan.  Mayhem follows in the form of loose cannon Reynald de Chatillon as he and Guy plot to instigate war between Christians and Muslims.  Baldwin IV dies of his leprosy, and Sibylla is crowned queen.  She, in turn, names her husband Guy as king.  Guy makes the fatal mistake of leading his army from Jerusalem to meet Saladin in the ill fated Battle of Hattin where the Crusaders were massacred.  Saladin marches on Jerusalem, the city and its people left in the hands of Balian who must command the defense of the city.   <br /> <br />Sure, it has its flaws.  But whether or not a movie is worth the two hours to watch it resides in the complete package.  Overall, the sum of Kingdom of Heaven equates to a solid 3 ? star rating.  If you found the previews intriguing, I believe it's worth the time to at least watch it and form your own opinion despite the negative reviews.  It may have started off slow, but by the end I was pleasantly surprised and got more than I expected. <br />
B0009Y8MM0|5.0|Could you image the best of the Def Leppard, Europe, Journey, Bon Jovi, House of Lords, mixed in one single band? Yeah! This is FM in Tough it Out. If their debut \\"Indiscreet\\" already was a top ten in this category... we have here a play above the avarege of 80's hard-rock music.

B00005JKHP|5.0|The first time I saw this film I was 18, I thought it was interesting but too slow. Now some years later, I watched it for the second time and have second thoughts. Who cares about action and laser battles? This film is intelligent and makes you think a for a while, well, is not a lecture on philosophy, but of all ST films this is the most 'intellectual'. Besides, the FX are almost excellent and the V'ger craft is impressive. Most purist trekies comment on the missing Kirk/Spock/McCoy trinity, while this is true, I do not care about it. This is more a science fiction movie than a Star Trek one, that nevertheless is faithful to one of Star Trek's premises: '...to explore new life forms'. I give this movie 5 stars because I like Star Trek, I'd give it 4 instead from a general movie point of view: it is good, interesting AND entertaining as a piece of its genre.  <br />Forget that modern and dull cliche that movies must have action, battles or fast pace to be good: ST Nemesis has a lot of action and battles and it is lame. <br />This film is superior, it matches with The Wrath of Kahn, of course not in action scenes but in movie quality. I recommend it to everyone that do not think that action is the only thing worth in a movie! <br />About the Director's Cut, I liked it, a little different but equally good, but I'd wish that we had the other version in the same pack, like the Alien series DVDs.
B000007MVM|5.0|Want to hear something TOTALLY unlike any thing else you have ever come across? Want to see why  Syd Barrett inspires an almost spiritual devotion in his fans? Even after not recording anything or even hardly uttering a WORD publicly  for over 35 years?  C'mon... admit it-haven't you always wondered about the Madcap?... here is your chance -while this album is still available... this is a MUST HAVE- if you consider yourself knowledgeable about rock music- and have a desire to expand into something that surpasses any classification- this is it, friends., I have listened to so much music in my life and times... and there is NOTHING/NO ONE  out there like Syd Barrett- and particularly THIS album-The Madcap Laughs. <br /> Each song (even the seriously frightening trainwreck that is \\"If it's in you\\")has a distinct ,different emotion, soundscape, mood, and lyric sensibility.. Here is a person exploding with creativity-and yet imploding from WHATEVER his inner demons are deciding to foist on him-and unself-conscioulsy taking us along for the ride....the lazy soft amazement of \\"Terrapin'(\\"Well oh baby -my hair's on end about you\\"); The mocking guitar sounds  of \\"No Good trying\\" (with the Classic line\\"I can tell/ that you can't be/ what you pretend\\" <br />\\"Love You\\"- such a jaunty  sweet little love song...  hard to believe he could seem so lighthearted...and having fun.... <br />\\"No Man's Land\\"...Whoa... MENACING...and you will strain your ears out of your head after \\"tell Me Tell me Tell me\\" trying to figure out what he is really saying in the spoken part....\\"Heavily Spaced \\", indeed.... <br />but the quintessential Madcap song - (arguably,the most oft quoted one)Dark Globe\\"   is so gut wrenching... one wonders how it must have felt to actually sing the line...\\"I tattooed my brain all the way... Won't you Miss me?\\"  <br />\\"Here i go-\\"  this song makes me wanna cheer for him at the end...  <br />'Octopus\\"the song that gives the album its title(from a line in the song\\"The Madcap laughed at the man on the border\\")has such a  funky rhythm and so many great lyrics.. you'll wonder how you can begin to memorize them, so quickly-and how much fun it is to sing along with!  <br />Golden Hair is eerily beautiful... <br />and the song that blew my mind the first time i heard it \\"Long gone\\"- a Masterpiece!incredible harmonies.. and soaring soundscapes...Imagery...left me shaking my head at its perfection.... <br /> I of course -am a total Barrett fan..and it is THIS album that sealed the deal ,folks... i defy anyone to listen to \\"Feel\\" and not have a pang of empathy for the hurt in this man's voice when he sings...\\"you feel me- away far too empty/ OH  SO ALONE\\" <br />\\"Late night\\" is a beauty .. a gem of a love song... which contains the classic Barrett line\\"Inside me I feel-alone and unreal-and the way you kiss will always be a very special thing to me\\"  <br />and back to the song i called a Trainwreck... painful on first listen--- true.. until you realize he is singing the melody HE wants to hear or what he hears in his head... and i like that he is DETERMINED to do it -NO MATTER WHAT!!! it isn't a mistake to HIM- .. he doesn't give up or give in.. hardheaded lil soul he was!Gotta love him for sticking to his guns.... <br /> this album is a treasure ... at the time it was released Barrett was still , i believe, thinking of himself as actively being in the music business... and still being creative, and ambitious in his own way -on his own terms-and, to me- not as fragile or frail YET- as some may have thought...Someone asked me recently -\\"Who does Syd sound like?\\" Truthfully? cannot imagine ANYONE else like him... I believe most long term Barrett fans consider THIS album to be  the definitive one...it is tough for me because i consider Madcap,Barrett. and Opel as one body of work by an extraordinarily intuitive, creative and fascinating artist...who paints tone poems as deftly as Van Gogh painted the night sky... and who could make you experience what he was feeling -without having to use anything but the most basic of words and ideas...deliciously simple...Follow his consciousness into the Madcap Laughs... you will be glad you did....and you will understand...
0316168815|1.0|Because I let myself be convinced by so much publicity about this book I bought it (they even made a program in NPR).  Don't make my mistake. Maybe because my favorite books are historical fiction with good storylines that keeps you glued to the pages, I found this book really boooring.  It was difficult to keep reading it because I could not care less about the characters.  Its like a \\"7th heaven\\" tragedy mixed with the \\"The Wonder Years\\" (do you remember the series with Fred Savage?).  I read 2/3 of the book and I was not sure I was going to finish it; I finished it so I could write this review and warn other people about it.  I did not even like the narrative, too simplistic.  I won't recommend it unless you are a suburban mom that can identify her family with the one portrayed by the book, then you might like it.

B00009ATKS|2.0|It's not that it's bad...it just isn't very good. When I listen, I keep waiting for this catharsis that never seems to happen. They keep bumping against it, but they can't seem to break through. It's getting really difficult to tell their albums apart, and in my opinion they're one of the most over-rated bands out there. Even as a live act they fail to produce the type of energy that gets the blood boiling. I saw them with Bardo Pond, and Bardo completely upstaged them. I don't know...this is good background music, but that's the nicest thing I can come up with.

8185300534|5.0|This work is a classic in Advaita Vedanta philosophy. If you liked this book, you may also be interested in the works associated with Ramana Maharshi. These are probably the two quintessential figureheads for Vedanta philosophy in the 20th century. Parallels have been drawn between Vedanta and the works of Martin Buber and also those of western phenomenalogist thinkers such as Heidegger, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. Nevertheless, do not get caught up in words and concepts and miss the point. All is Self, you alone are real.
0684824906|5.0|Truly great writing.  She took a potentially dull subject like Lincoln's cabinet and turned it into spell binding (and historically accurate) history.  I have been a Civil War buff for over 50 years and read my share of stories about battles and generals.  This ranks up there with the best of them--if not the very best.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I recentally started getting the first season of Veronica Mars from International Library Loan, and I am now a fan of it.  However, I can't help but compare Veronica to Buffy from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Chloe, from Smallville.  Veronica is sarcastic like Buffy and is really similar, in character, to Chloe.  But overall, it's a great show.  It's just too bad I don't get UPN.  Hopefully, when the WB and UPN combine, I'll be able to see it.  For the meantime, however, I'll just settle to reading the scripts online.

Every single song on this cd is a HIT. Period. Music lovers know what I'm talking about.  She has captured and held tight to her audience for how long... Decades? And it's not for any reason other than the fact that she is TALENTED. She pretty much stays out of the spotlight. She keeps her private life, for the most part, pretty private, so we're not in love with the controversy... we're in love with the versatility... I don't really have a favorite song, but I guess if I had to pick one I would say \\"Cherish\\", \\"Borderline\\", \\"Material Girl!\\", \\"Express Yourself\\", I mean they are all pretty awesome tracks to be honest... This is a great CD to have, I'm not sure if Madonna has put out another Collection CD but you can bet after I submit this I'll be doing a search on amazon to check!
B000002UZ1|5.0|Because let's face it, they are the greatest band of all time.  Personally, I find it annoying when people disagree because you can't discredit their influence on rock n' roll.  I received this album when I was 9 years old.  I remember when I was very little I hated the beatles songs like Strawberry fields and such b/c I thought it was trash.  However, when I received this album I was absolutely blown away.  The album itself displays pure genious and doesn't miss anything in the process of giving great songs.  If you give this album to anybody who isn't interested they will love it.  If this is your first time considering listening to the beatles you have to get this because it is an essential for beginning fans - - a lot better than the 27 hit album.  Indulge yourself and spend a few bucks.
B000AMUU94|5.0|The Platinum Collection collects 58 of Bowie's most beloved recordings <br /> <br />Pluses: <br />- everything is remastered <br />- most of Bowie's essential hits are here <br />- a few rarities that are only available on the very expensive \\"Sound And Vision\\" box <br />- unlike \\"Sound And Vision\\", contains the hits as well <br /> <br />Minuses: <br />- I am fine with radio edits sometimes, because some are needed to save space,  but... why do we get the heavily edited \\"Heroes\\" (one of Bowie's finest hours) yet 7 minutes of \\"John I'm Only Dancing Again\\", which is one of the worst disco forays ever. <br />- the idea that 1987 was the end of Bowie's career is kinda presented here.  Any true Bowie fan knows that the past dozen or so years have been more fruitful and full of highlights than the 1980's were <br />- slightly overpriced considering the import is almost half the price as the US version <br /> <br />If you don't already have a huge Bowie collection, this one collects many of the greats for the first 20 years.   However, don't think that this is all you need... check out his latter albums, such as \\"Reality\\", \\"Hours\\", \\"Heathen\\", \\"Outside\\", \\"Earthling\\" and \\"Black Tie White Noise\\", all of these albums are wonderful and Bowie's had a silent renaissance.
B0000649CC|5.0|If you think Japanese animated films are all monsters, unfathomable philosophical mumbo jumbo and dodgy American accents - think again!<br /><br />Steamboy is a cracking adventure set in Victorian England with a great voice-over cast including Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin and Alfred Molina all delivering spot-on Northern accents (the characters come from Manchester).<br /><br />The plot rattles along like a steam train as a boy tries to discover the truth behind the disappearance of his inventor father, fending of the sinister attentions of rival factions using massive machines (steam powered, of course) that would have done credit to the imagination of H.G. Wells.<br /><br />Yes, it's a cartoon, yes kids will like it, but this is so much more than a children's movie. It's well made, imaginative and good fun.  This 45-year old loved it and will love it for many years to come.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|\\"The Constant Gardener\\" in an involving, character-driven drama with some fine performances.  Ralph Fiennes plays Justin, a British diplomat who is basically a good fellow but would rather focus on his new marriage and gardening hobby than really get involved with the world around him.  Rachel Weisz plays his wife Tessa, who IS very concerned about the world around her, to the occasional frustration of her husband, who wishes she could just relax a bit and enjoy life's simple pleasures.<br /><br />Tessa dies under mysterious circumstances in the film's opening minutes, and the first hour of the film is mostly a series of flashbacks showing how Justin and Tessa met and their early courtship and marriage, accompanied by the beginnings of Justin's investigation into her death.  The second hour focuses full bore on that investigation.  The film's cleverness and originality comes from the fact that Justin never gets to truly know his wife until his investigation of her death.<br /><br />Drug companies are the villains of the film, and it was interesting to discover in the DVD's special features section that the story wasn't based on any true-life drug company scandals, but rather novelist John le Carre's dramatic supposition that drug companies WOULD eventually get into the kind of trouble depicted in his book and the subsequent film. In one of the DVD interviews, the author's researcher says, \\"I spoke to a few drug company executives, and, amazingly, in confidence they said to me that, yes, the kind of cover ups seen in the story aren't in any way implausible and, in fact, would probably occur if a money-driven situation like the one in the story happened in real life.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Constant Gardener\\" does everything a good thriller- indeed, a good movie- should do.  It involves you in its plot, offers complex, interesting characters that the viewer grows to care about, and shows you a few things (locales, professions, situations) you don't see every day.  On that final point, it was nice to see a plot largely set in Africa, though there are many scenes in Great Britain, too.  And, oh yes, Rachel Weisz really deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar she ultimately won for her role as Tessa.  She's amazing here.hat final point, it was nice to see a plot largely set in Africa, though there are many scenes in Great Britain, too.

B0000025DV|5.0|Music is like fashion. It goes by cycles. However, unlike fashion, when it's over, it doesn't really come back.     ELO is probably one of those super bands of the 70s-80s that will however be remembered forever because of their concept, sound and quality. And Out of the blue is to me the album one must have in a collection ! This album is  diverse, rich,tonic and so polished by fine studio musicians that I could talk about it on no less than three pages. My favourite track is \\"Standing in the rain\\". It has everything. Depth, power, lyricism, changes of rythm, multiple sequences, but you do have tons of different sounds from beginning to end of this collection of songs :    -Latin tango like/classic piano sound on the lyrical \\"It's over\\",   -Classic Violin with guitars a la Roy Orbison on \\"Sweet talkin woman\\"   -Mexican trumpets on \\"across the border\\"  -The drive in \\"night in the city\\", total madness...  -The oriental flavour mixed with rocky guitars in \\"Jungle\\" (with the Tarzan cry as a bonus!)  -Beethoven on \\"Leaving me now\\"  -Australian bands (not AC/Dc though !) guitar sound on \\"Summer and lightning\\"  -Techno on the \\"Whale\\"  I'll let you find out more for yourself.    All this plus the cover sleeve design and witty, unpretentious lyrics make it the highest moment in their discography. And whoever says this is disco music is wrong. True that ELO sounded in every disco at the time, but almost everything did and everybody danced to it (even Dire Straits, not really a disco band...). The dancy tracks are far from being the greasy cheap songs from that era, which makes them very listenable tracks today, almost thrity years later. Talkin' about the Spice Girls or the Take That (who still remembers) ?     A pity the big bands concept is out of fashion, but if you like this cd, get the Barclay James Harvest and The Alan Parsons Project (I Robot and Pyramid are probably good choices) or Supertramp (Crisis What crisis, and Crime of the Century are my best bets), or even Yes. If you really want to label ELO, I would go for a \\"Symphonic rock\\" one. But please, this is not DISCO !    Cheers.    The wild west hero. ;)
B00008D1NF|5.0|I loved this CD so much when i was in Europe, and i still do now, being here in the States. i am so glad they have portugese AND english translations inside of the CD--the lyrics to Ja sei namorar are so powerful, so deep--knowing their meaning is essential to appreciating this powerful Brazilian pop.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|I saw this movie 10 minutes ago in a hotel room.  Immediately, I go to Amazon.com to see if I can buy it.  This is how good the movie is.  You want to own it and watch it again and again.  The story is good (no doubt, if you have read the book).  The director is good.  Just love it.  Highly recommended.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|A high quality movie with high moral standards.  A must for those who collect period dramas.
0688170528|5.0|This is the sort of book you stay in to read when everyone else is going out. I found it an incredible read. I was encaptulated with the story of Chris and Emily and the extreameness of their love. Being close to their age perhaps helped me relate to them more then the adults in this story, but Picoult wrote this so well i could emphasise with nearly all characters. My mother read this after me and said  as an adult and a parent, this is definatly not one to miss. It was heart renching to read about Chris and his family and Emily's family having to go through the ordeal of Emily's loss, if this wont bring a tear to your eye, i dont know what will. <br />Perhaps it was a bit far fetched for it to happen in real life, as if Chris did love Emily as much as he claimed would he of been able to do what he did?  <br />This book is a terrific read, and would make a remarkable film. <br />five out of five
B00005JLKB|5.0|A co-worker got me hooked on this series and I have to say that it is one of the best TV series ever made!
B000002LEU|4.0|I won't say a single word about the emotional weight of Joy Division's music or the impossible burden of Ian Curtis' words; other reviewers do that sort of thing far more justice than I could ever hope.  Instead, I want to make some important points for those considering the purchase of Substance: <br /> <br />1.) Substance was not assembled at random.  Its logic is actually quite praiseworthy: theoretically this disc is supposed to collect ALL the non-album tracks - songs given to compilations, A-sides, B-sides, and EP tracks - into one place, to function as a companion to Unknown Pleasures and Closer.  To that end, NONE of the songs present on this compilation are available on their two regular albums, though two songs are duplicated from the posthumous outtakes album Still (\\"Glass\\" and \\"Dead Souls\\" - the former is only ho-hum for Joy Division, the latter is a key track, but their inclusion is more justifiable here than it is on that set since both were officially released within the band's working life).  People who see \\"She's Lost Control\\" on the tracklisting here need to realize that this is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT version than the one on Unknown Pleasures (the boxed set calls it the `12\\" version'), and it's arguably far superior.  <br /> <br />2.) Frustratingly, Substance nevertheless fails at its stated purpose.  Now I'm not a pedant - I don't really begrudge the absence of minor tracks like the instrumental \\"As You Said\\" or the flexidisc toss-off \\"Sound Of Music\\" - but one omission in particular is agonizing: the spectacular, glowing alternate version of \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" that shared the B-side of the more famous single version of that song with \\"These Days.\\"  It's a gorgeous, poignantly haunting recording (I waver on whether it's superior to the well-known version presented here), and it was even inexcusably excluded from the boxed set (which at the very least ought to have collected all of their officially released work before including outtakes).The only place to find it on CD is the otherwise worthless compilation Permanent. <br /> <br />3.) The sound quality on this CD is really beginning to show its age.  My introduction to Joy Division was with the sparkling remastered sound of the Heart And Soul boxed set, and when I happened to hear a friend's version of this disc I was stunned to find out how desiccated and distant the individual CDs sound.  I want to make it clear that I'm not a person with impossibly fussy ears, and that I have thousands of CD's worth of experience with remastering before-and-after comparisons, when I say that the difference between the cleaned up version of the Joy Division catalogue available on the boxed set and the versions available on these individual CDs is one of the more pronounced ones still on the market. <br /> <br />4.) As for the contents of album itself, is this where you should begin with Joy Division?  I'm not sure.  It's ONE possible place, but heaven help you if you begin here and fail to continue onward to Unknown Pleasures and Closer, none of whose songs are found here.  I sometimes like to argue that Joy Division's best moments came on their singles and compilation tracks, and that Substance really represents their peak.  Given the evidence of formidable tracks like \\"Digital\\" and \\"From Safety To Where...?,\\" the incredible singles \\"Transmission,\\" \\"Atmosphere,\\" and \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart,\\" and their equally impressive B-sides (\\"Novelty,\\" \\"Dead Souls,\\" \\"These Days\\"), that still seems like a good assessment.  But this is only 1/3 of the story, and the real problem is that if you're at all intrigued by this group, you're going to eventually want to buy the \\"complete studio works\\" boxed set Heart And Soul.  I was lucky enough to have begun there - I took a leap of faith that paid off - but if you buy this CD and are transfixed by it, I would recommend that you do NOT go buy Unknown Pleasures and Closer next (both of which sound equally flakey in their current unremastered CD form) but rather invest in the boxed set and save yourself money that you'd otherwise end up spending anyway.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|At its core this film is not about sexuality; it is about profound loss and about not living a true life. Not one character comes though the other end of this without loss. And why? Not easily answered. An intolerant society and a rigid masculine template jump to mind. This film is hard to characterize, though. From its opening shot to its final one, there is an overwhelming sense of isolation and loneliness. Time passes but the outside world rarely infiltrates; some songs, some hairstyles, some newer cars but rarely the news of the day. This remoteness makes the film and its ultimate conclusion a tragedy. If there is ever a place to live a truthful and fulfilling life it should be Brokeback Mountain, but neither Jack Twist, nor especially Ennis del Mar, can truly live the life they fundamentally desire. As it stands, theirs is a mingled life that spans many years and yet still seems empty and devoid. I cannot say truthfully that the actions of these men are without criticism especially with how they affect others in their lives but nothing they do to other people compares to what they do to each other. While theirs is a timeless love, both physically and spiritually, they also are haunted with melancholy and emptiness; a troubled human conflict that will shake most loving people to their core.<br /><br />As a film it is remarkable. Ang Lee's direction is a masterly and will be studied. Every image, every performance and edit is delicately and masterfully maintained throughout. The performances are amazing and for some will be career defining. Ledger is revelatory and I would stand his performance alongside any of Brando's early ones. You know Ennis. You love him and are angry with him and Ledger is never false in his portrayal. Gyllenhaal is just as amazing. Jack is the yin to Ennis' yang and Jake nails him. Without his character's love for life, the final scenes would not carry as much emotionally. Jake's performance is focused in his eyes and the sparkling flame within them. Watching that flame diminish over time is heartbreaking. Michelle Williams' Alma has deservedly received accolades and she is raw and real. Just as noteworthy is Anne Hathaway and I must say she really surprised me. In what could have been a mannered and arch character, she brings Lureen startlingly to life, most notably in her phone conversation with Ennis. The photography and music are beautifully intertwined and will stir your emotions and haunt you for days.<br /><br />That this film is subjected to trite and hateful degradations by some is saddening. It seems at conflict with the truth and compassion that these \\"moral\\" people aspire to. To spout vitriol about this film seems so misplaced if anyone has truthfully seen it. It is this hate, however, that hits to the core of what Ennis believes. That no matter how fundamentally real Ennis' and Jack's feelings are for one another, there will be those that hate them and being hated is a more unspeakable horror than living alone.e within them.

B00008WG3U|5.0|I've liked NOFX for a while, as I've always thought they've been good for a punk rock band. But this album is one of the best they've done since Punk in Drublic. I know alot of you have a problem with it because 1. It knocks George Bush or 2.It is actually tolerable to listen to. For one, i don't care that it knocks Bush. He's a moron, but I don't care, i'm canadian. In my opinion, the songs aren't good because they're about politics, they are good just because they ARE. Songs like Seperation of Church and Skate and Franco Un-American are just crazy good, and make this album an awesome buy.
B000002KDI|4.0|This album is excellent. The opening of this CD is more acoustic and laid back and in the second half Young and Crazy Horse rock out. I have lots of memories listening to this album with friends either in the car or out drinking when we camped. My personal favorites are Powderfinger, Comes a Time, Needle and the damage done/Lotta love and Sedan Delivery. If you really love Neil Young though i'd buy \\"on the beach\\" if you don't already own it and you call yourself a Young fan you gotta buy that before this. Overall a solid album with Live Rust though.
B00005JNTX|3.0|But I went with 3 because of the hype this movie gets- some attention it deserves and other attention not so much. This movie just seemed to be almost desperatly trying to be cool. A movie that \\"cool, enlightening\\" kids and/or adults would love. Being in High School at the time of it's release it seemed every \\"popular\\" kid loved this movie. I mean maybe I have a bias, but it's just I didn't think it was that good. It's long, it jumps storylines with little connection and it overall is too ambitious for it's own good. I mean I love movies of similar sorts such as Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, but this movie just was a bit too much for me. I think it's worth renting (although it's on Starz and HBO now to my knowledge) and I will see the second, it's just not as good as people make it out to be. Will most people actually like this movie? I doubt it. Great cast, great director, not so great story line = OK movie.
B00005JLKB|5.0|My mother, who happens to love Superman (especially the movies that came out with Christopher Reeve, as well as the countless cartoons of him), got hooked on to this show from the beginning.  I didn't know what the fuss was all about, so I didn't get into it until I caught \\"Nicodemus,\\" the first show I ever caught from this series.  I heard a snippet of a song that intrigued me (Zero 7's \\"Destiny\\"), and I swear, from that moment on I was hooked.  Looking at the attractive and talented cast made this show all the more compelling and hard to hate.<br /><br />And another thing about this show: you can NEVER get tired of looking at Tom Welling, or Kristin Kreuk, for the men.  I'm being completely HONEST about that!
0792843584|5.0|Heaven's Gate is an incredible piece of filmmaking.  I initially rented it on VHS in the 1980's, and shut it off, because the negative press affected me so much, I kept saying to myself how awful it was.  Then a few years later, I rented it again, and said \\"it isn't that bad\\".  Then I rented it in a letterboxed version, and realised just how gorgeous and tragic the film is.  It's an unqualified masterpiece, and kudos to the reviewers on this page for pointing this out.  One reviewer compared it to Visconti's The Leopard, Bertolucci's 1900, and Leone's Once Upon a Time in America.  It is a worthy comparison.  Cimino was ostracized (to say the least) for this film.  While he still managed to make a few more films (Year of the Dragon, The Silician), his career was essentially over.  The critics dumped on the film, mainly because of its turbulent production history (it did have a troubled production, but many great films have).  The original version ran 219 minutes, but after a disastrous premiere (mainly the critics trashing the film), Cimino recut it to 149 minutes.  Luckily, when released on home video, it was the 219 minute version.  The 149 minute version never made it to home video.  It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it needs to be rediscovered.  Many reviewers here are doing just that.  Cimino himself is a recluse now, and rarely talks about this film (which I can understand).  I long for the day when this film is shown in its entirety at a film festival, and it receives a standing ovation, and Cimino takes a bow for his art.....
B00005JO9J|5.0|I didn't get to see too much of the first season, and after I viewed a synopsis of what happened in the first/second season, was when I had to buy Season One of Grey's Anatomy.<br /><br />I love the cast, and I feel for Ellen Pompeo.  She was tripped out when I saw the show on DVD, but now on TV, I find myself not liking her.  Especially after what she did to George...I know she had hate mail coming in all sorts of forms for weeks after that.  And I absolutely LOVE that George is moving on with a new love interest.<br /><br />I can relate to the show so much so because I work in a health-care setting, where gossip spreads faster than fire.  It doesn't matter if it's good or bad, it just happens to be heard.<br /><br />Despite that, the show is very good (and, I'm sorry to say, better than Desperate Housewives), and I can't wait to get Season Two on DVD!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|My introduction to Johnny Cash's music was when I was eight years old. My father started collecting his albums (8-tracks actually) and whenever we were on the road he'd pop one in and we'd listen to I Walk The Line or Ring Of Fire or Folsom Prison Blues; those were the main ones anyway. My dad wasn't a big music fan back then - he was extremely selective - but Cash was his exception. Not knowing what Johnny's music was all about, I really didn't give much thought as to why my father should or shouldn't like the singer (\\"He sings real good, doesn't he Dad?\\" \\"Yes he does\\"). This might seem more like a family reminiscence on my part but humor me for just one more minute.<br /><br />My father was pretty conservative: he paid his taxes on time without question, was a Marine, believed in the death penalty, enjoyed any kind of sports, and coached in a Pop-Warner football league.<br /><br />Fast forward to this movie, Walk The Line, and I have to wonder why my father felt so strongly for this man's music. Johnny Cash was anything but conservative. Joaquin Phoenix's excellent portrayal of Mr. Cash - from his humble beginnings on an Arkansas farm to his nearly fatal brush with amphetamine addiction - shows us all the flaws this incredibly gifted man had balled up inside him. He drank like a fish, womanized while on tour, supported better living standards for prison inmates (something my father would NEVER agree with), and enjoyed the rock-a-billy sounds that were just emerging onto the airwaves. Cash's worldviews were fairly extreme and this spilled over into the lyrics for his songs (just listen to his best-selling At Folsom Prison album and you'll see what I mean).<br /><br />So what was it about Johnny Cash that pulled my dad into his fandom?<br /><br />Well, this movie shows us. Johnny Cash's voice (\\"Like a freight train coming `round a bend but sharp as a razor\\") is hypnotic, and Mr. Phoenix deserves all of the notoriety he's received for playing this role. It's stunning to learn that Joaquin didn't lip-sync any of the songs, but sung them all himself. And although Johnny Cash's voice was a bit coarser and deeper, Mr. Phoenix should be congratulated for his singing talent. He amazed me.<br /><br />The shining light in the movie, however, was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Who could've guessed that this Legally Blonde comedic talent could act so dramatically? Her singing voice was wonderful, too, doing all of June Carter's songs without lip-syncing ... just as Joaquin had.<br /><br />But I do have two complaints. First, I didn't much care for the ending. I felt it was abrupt and tried too hard to tie everything up into a nice \\"family package\\" in just a few minutes. Second (although not really a complaint but more of a comparison) is that there've been some really great character films done in the past few years, and although Walk The Line ranks right up there with the best of them, I felt that Jamie Foxx did a bit better job in Ray (but I think overall Walk The Line was better as entertainment).<br /><br />Still, this is a great movie with excellent filming and information about an American icon of the music industry.

B000A59PMO|5.0|I used to read Nancy Drew when I was younger.  Loved watching Smallville, especially when Chloe had a mystery to solve (I love that another reviewer made the same connection as I did, but from another angle).  Now I get to see Veronica Mars, and I love it!  I caught the pilot, and though I had to miss some episodes, I HAD to buy the first season on DVD!  I found out later on as I watched, that I missed A LOT.  So now I'm patiently waiting for the second season to come out.  When I first watched Veronica Mars, my sister would get up and leave the room when I watched it.  Now that I've got it on DVD, she loves it!<br /><br />What I love about this series is that Veronica has strong family values: she stood by her dad, and searching out for her mother, even when her dad, a private eye himself, had given up hope of trying to find her.  Though she is labeled as an outcast, she has people in \\"high\\" places: her 09er friend Meg, the PCH biker Weevil, and her best friend/case helper Wallace, to name a select few.  What I happened to like the most was that she had determination and spunk to see her way through everything she pursues, even at her father's exasperation.  I don't want to give anything away (though some reviewers have), in case you haven't watched it.<br /><br />All you'll get from me is this: the first season, she had a LOT of work to do.  In the second season (watch UPN, folks!), she's tied up in another mystery that she has her work cut out for her (and is in it, by the way), and it's just as good as the first season's big question/case, if not better.
B00005O5UK|5.0|Call it what you like, this album is progressive because Jethro Tull married multiple musical styles on one album.  The album is conceptual because the entire song is actually multiple songs married into one song by a variety of transitions and interludes.  There may be occasional unevenness in the transitions, but in general the whole thing works and is one of the most unique works in rock music.<br /><br />Early progressive rock was born in fits and starts.  Tracing back, some of the earliest identifiable elements of progressive rock show up in some Beatles' songs.  The Moody Blues provided more definition to progressive rock, and created the first progressive rock albums, though their progressive rock was on the lighter side and was much less daring than King Crimson, who's \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" established how cutting edge progressive rock could be.  By 1972, progressive rock had a better-defined face, and that face was readily identifiable on albums such as \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Close to the Edge,\\" by Yes, \\"Foxtrot\\" by Genesis, and \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" by Jethro Tull.  There were quite a few other progressive albums released by 1972, and numerous other artists using progressive elements in their music, but these albums were among those that helped to define the limits, or lack thereof, of progressive rock.<br /><br />As serious as some of us like to believe this album is, it is a satire.  This album pokes fun at issues contemporary to 1972, which somehow remain somewhat contemporary now.  Some examples:  the drive to push society to cater to the needs of the \\"average\\" person rather than helping the above-average person develop their skills; the debate over war and the need for war; helping others to build their country and then having them go to war with you; people who live on the dole rather than being some useful part of society.  The list is quite extensive, and much of the tone is sarcastic and often caustic.<br /><br />To match the extensive nature of the album lyrics are musical styles that range nearly as wide:  there are catchy pop-like tunes; there are folk-classical influenced portions; there is a dirge on side two; there are faster rock portions; even a bit of pomp and circumstance.  I have not covered half the range of styles.  At the very least, Jethro Tull wasn't afraid to commit their feelings of the moment musically to an album.  Artistically their vision on this album is as expansive as any other group I can recall.  Add to this broad range of styles sound effects and bizarre transitions, and you can tell that not only did Jethro Tull use everything; they also threw in the kitchen sink.<br /><br />This album became a nearly instant classic in 1972.  It vaulted to number one, and for a while made Jethro Tull one of the biggest groups in rock, though their music was far broader than rock.  The album was also anti-establishment (a term that has not been spoken since at least the early 70s).  Though portions of the counter-culture lyrics are relatively plain, substantial other portions of the lyrics are subtle, nearly cryptic, and manage to poke fun at numerous institutions and philosophies.  Some messages are so cleverly phrased and subtle that you could call Jethro Tull progressive rock for intellectuals, though you need not delve that deeply into Tull's lyrics to enjoy them.<br /><br />By the way, the phrase \\"thick as a brick\\" is slang for \\"stupid\\".  I think Ian Anderson was already poking fun at those that would not have the foggiest idea at what he was attempting to do with this CD, and already having a big laugh in preparation for the reaction after the album was released.  The reaction was mixed.  Many critics hailed it for its \\"message\\"; others derided it for being counter-culture and musical garbage.  Likely many people ascribed deeper meanings to it where there were none, and missed the meaning where there was some.  At the end of it all was Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull, laughing, because theyknew from the beginning that all of this was their art, which has to be interpreted by each person in their own way, and one person may see something that another doesn't, which ultimately means that while there are some clearly common elements, you don't want to make too much of the meanings.  They are what they are, and they may be different for you and me.  Isn't great music grand?<br /><br />Five stars for one of the best progressive rock albums to ever be released, and for music to be intellectually stimulated by.<br /><br />Note that this version of \\"Thick as a Brick\\" is a Japanese remaster with two additional tracks, a live version of \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and an interview track.  Other versions with substantially different prices are available, so you may wish to look around before selecting the version that best meets your needs.

B00005JO20|5.0|These days, it is rare to see the main hero or protagaonist die at the end of the movie. During the Great Depression, when the standard of living was much lower, life much harsher, and death much closer, it wasn't too unusual for the hero to meet his death. Good things, in such times, seems to be ephemeral.<br /><br />If King Kong was made as an original today, surely the heroic gorilla would have continued to live in happiness or at least have his death be meaningful. But King Kong, of course, dies a tragic and misunderstood death.<br /><br />I cried in the last 10 minutes of this film. It is not neccessarily his death that disturbs us; we all know how he would die beforehand. But it is a needless death of a creature of awesome physical prowess and agility with genuine human need for companionship which deeply disturbs us.<br /><br />The 1933 version wasn't as depressing because King Kong was portrayed as a wild brut who happened to have a weird fascination with Anne Darrow. But in this version, King Kong is almost human, and his love for Anne Darrow is not so weird because we understand his strong need for a companion.<br /><br />At the end, one of the characters mention \\"it was beauty that killed him\\". I disagree, it was man, the most terrifying killer of all, who has a need to kill everything and everyone which is perceived as a threat, that killed King Kong.  This killer instinct and behavior, it seems, is one of the reasons why we are at the top of the evolutionary heirarchy. But it is also what makes us the most cruelest creature of all.
B000005RU2|5.0|oh yeah....THIS is why I always liked Purple more than Led Zep, nothing against Zep mind you. This has got to be one of the all time great live recordings by a rock band. For me, 'Highway Star' says it all. This version makes the one on MACHINE HEAD pale by comparison, and that WAS a good version! They are simply firing on all cylinders on this track, the big Purple sound in all its glory.<br /><br />Jon Lord is one of my all time favorite Hammond players, he just makes the damn thing breath fire. His playing on this track and CD just goes to confirm why the Hammond organ, in the right hands, is one of the greatest instruments ever created. It is such a powerful instrument and Lord takes full advantage. He was the X factor in this band, the perfect compliment to Blackmore's fiery guitar work, what a duo! Gillan's voice is in great form and what can I say about Ian Paice on drums, one of my favorite drummers ever since I was turned on to the IN ROCK recording way back when. And of course, Roger Glover is the glue that holds it all together. For me, they just don't make bands like this anymore. The MKII version remains one of my favorite bands beacuse I loved the songs and they had the musical chops to back it up. THIS is what good, solid hard rock music is all about. Oh yeah, one of the highlights of my life was to actually meet and talk with Ritchie Blackmore back in the 80's. Crank this bad boy up and stand back, no turkey is served here, LONG LIVE PURPLE!!!<br /><br />[...]
1592401791|5.0|Geoff Emerick has added an important volume to the canon of writings on the world's greatest rock band. As recording and mixing engineer for The Beatles' most important works (Sgt Pepper, Abbey Road, etc), he was an active participant in the then-new concept of using the studio as an instrument. In this well-written book, he shares his sharp memories of those sessions in the straightforward manner of a decent bloke sharing a pint at the local pub, and really transports you to those historic times. Emerick is-unfairly in my opinion-harsh in his criticism of Harrison's musicianship, and there are sure to be discrepancies regarding who takes credit for what, but all in all, it's a page-turner for Beatleheads everywhere. Those with no interest in the technical/creative aspects of the recording process may not be as enthralled.

1400079179|5.0|The last thing you need is the 3,502nd review of this book, so I almost didn't write one. But several reviews are so wildly off base, I want to respond.<br /><br />Some reviewers seem to be comparing this book with the finest literature and find it lacking on that count. It's a murder mystery, and an intelligent, clever, and thoughtful one at that. I could not put it down. If you're looking for Chekhov, read Chekhov (really, you should read Chekhov, he's wonderful). If you're looking for a really good mystery, read the Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />It appears that others who give the book a poor review are offended by the ideas in this book.<br /><br />Those that claim there is no basis whatsoever for the ideas relating to theological history, which are quite liberal, are wrong. There is a historical basis for these theories, and Brown references some books on this subject in the novel itself and on his website.<br /><br />No one, including Dan Brown, is saying these ideas are absolutely true. Brown has not presented them as historical fact, as some reviewers claim, but rather as ideas that have been and are being explored by historians and theologians. While some dismiss these theories out of hand, Brown's work encourages us to consider these controversial ideas.<br /><br />If you are easily offended by liberal theological theory, you will not enjoy this book, it will just bug you. If you enjoy exploring these ideas, the book will hold even more interest for you than it would for those who enjoy solving riddles and puzzles, which is another very enjoyable part of the book.<br /><br />In fact, I'm surprised and delighted by the book's success, now that I've finally read it and learned how much it encourages us to learn about the sacred feminine. It is clear that Brown supports the idea of balancing the masculine and feminine in religion. I love that idea, but it's something most aren't used to in a world where patriarchal religions are dominant.<br /><br />Overall, it's a fantastic book, and I'm upset by the unfounded poor reviews. But again, I don't think you'll enjoy it if you're offended by liberal theological ideas - you may be disappointed if you buy it without realizing that this is a big part of the story. I believe most others will enjoy it.reviews.

B000CEV3YQ|2.0|Leider muss ich die hohe Kundenwertung ein wenig korrigieren. Ich habe mir den Film anlässlich der hier sehr positiv dargestellten Bewertung ausgeliehen. Leider bin ich sehr enttäuscht worden. Die Handlung dieses Films ist an den Haaren herbeigezogen. Zwar kann ich über so etwas hinwegsehen, wenn es zumindest innovative, lustige Dialoge gibt. Damit kann dieser Film jedoch auch nicht dienen. Zu den schauspielerischen Leistungen : Wie kann man bei diesem Film überhaupt gut spielen !?!? Val Kilmer ist wie immer (siehe z.B. Wonderland) extrem stereotyp, und Robert Downey Jr. hat den ganzen Film über exakt den gleichen Gesichtsausdruck. <br />Kurz gesagt : Wer hier Tarantino-Qualität (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown....) oder gar Guy Richi-Qualität (Snatch ...) erwartet, dem sei dieser Film aufs wärmste abzuraten. Ich kann bei diesem Film (und ich bin echt offen für so einiges)nicht verstehen, warum man den so hoch loben kann.  Die zwei Sterne, die ich dennoch verleihe haben ihren Grund in einer 5 Sekunden-Szene in der Robert Downey Jr. russisches Roulette in einer sehr amateurhaft lustigen Weise spielt. <br />ABER : Dies ist kein Rechtfertigungsgrund sich diesen Film zu kaufen ! Lieber 5-6 Monate warten und dann für 5-7 € kaufen (wenns denn unbedingt sein muss).

B00028HBKC|5.0|I am writing this review on Good Friday, April 14, 2006. This is the right time to watch the movie. Your DVD player becomes a time machine taking you back in time almost 2000 years.  <br />And now you can see everything! Everything, the way it really happened! You become one of those in the crowd and you can see their faces. You can see that some of them are scared; and some of them are like wild animals smelling blood. <br />When I was a child and learned about the crucifixion, I was confused by the fact that Jesus was killed and the Lord did not come to help him. Why did the Lord allow this to happen? In my understanding, God was a superman and He could do everything. I was daydreaming about a mighty angel in shining armor coming from the sky and sweeping away the soldiers and the lynching crowd with his sword of fire. It seemed to me that at some point Jesus expected the same... <br />I understand now that He knew at that time it was not going to happen. The Father, however, had not betrayed Him. The Father, I think now, had something different in mind, and what is most important, the ways of the Father are different. He does not use weapons, armed warriors and military campaigns. In my present understanding, the Lord works through the minds of people and wants people to understand His will and follow it voluntarily. <br />They crucified Him. It was a terrible tragedy! Watching the movie now I sometimes become furious: \\"Don't touch Him, you scoundrels! This is our Lord! Our Master! Our hope!...\\" But no, they are taking Him away! They will kill Him. There is no hope. We are doomed! <br /> Jesus was firm. He defeated the Satan with His spirit. But why was the Satan smiling? He had the crowd. He still has many, many of us. <br />Yes, this is how it happened! This is exactly how they took Him away and crucified Him; almost 2000 years ago. Mel Gibson and the cast have created a miracle.  <br />And now, when the end comes and we turn off the time machine, it is good toask ourselves a very private question: <br /> \\"Was this all in vain?\\"

B0006L16N8|2.0|The first two Coldplay albums were warm and intimate affairs (especially parachutes) Like an old worn sweatshirt that you keep throwing back on year after year, those albums held a nostalgic and unpretentious appeal not found in many other records. The new record is large and looming, the songs feel conventional, and the intimacy and oblique appeal to the lyrics have been replaced by gushing sentiment and perplexed theological musings. I believe that Chris Martin is immensely talented as a songwriter, and this album just feels like a timid step in the bands evolution. If he lets loose on the next record, and really experiments artistically with the sound (Embrace the post punk, and electronica vaguely alluded to in this album!!!!) there is a good chance that the band will make something wonderful.  <br /> <br />Now, another band...and i dont normally plug bands but these guys just knocked me out...called Princeton is AMAZING. The songs are stunningly melodious, and from such a young band!! I am excited about these guys. Definitely worth checking out. Just search Princeton on Myspace.

0393324818|5.0|Baseball is a funny game, Joe Garagiola wrote. Also upsetting, thrilling, boring, redeeming, and traditional, often all in one nine-inning stretch. Something you don't hear so often is that baseball is scientific, not at least until Michael Lewis blew the lid off this dirty secret in his 2003 book, \\"Moneyball.\\"<br /><br />Lewis follows one Billy Beane, a one-time hot prospect for the New York Mets who unaccountably never found success in the big leagues until he even more unaccountably wound up the GM for the cash-poor Oakland As. There he began looking for bargain players who looked less like he did and more like his onetime teammate Lenny Dykstra, who looked all wrong for the game but was a star all the same.<br /><br />\\"In his own mind he ceased to be a guy who should have made it and became a guy upon whom had been heaped a lot of irrational hopes and dreams,\\" Lewis writes of Beane. \\"He had reason to feel some distaste for baseball's mystical nature. He would soon be handed a weapon to destroy it.\\"<br /><br />One wants to jump in here and observe that one man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist. But Beane's apostasy is covered with such unflinching zeal by Lewis it becomes hard to say where the subject ends and writer begins in \\"Moneyball's\\" colorful musings about the economic and strategic inefficiencies of the game.<br /><br />There are arguments to be made for tradition, for keeping players around even at the cost of paying them a market wage. But \\"Moneyball's\\" iconoclasm is so enjoyably presented, with Lewis's love for telling anecdotes and drop-dead quotes, it emerges as the first great baseball book of the 21st century, and the best anti-baseball book in its snarky, rebellious way since Jim Bouton's \\"Ball Four.\\"<br /><br />First of all, Lewis presents some bracing concepts, such as the importance of on-base percentage above batting average and RBIs, in a way that makes such knowledge fun to learn even if you are not predisposed to learn from it. He shines a light on the arcane science of sabermetrics, which breaks down how baseball works, in such a way you find yourself laughing at what is at heart a statistical analysis.<br /><br />And he does find a human side to the equation, in the stories of players conventional wisdom has given up on and Beane has rescued with an eye for a bargain:<br /><br />\\"The pleasure of rooting for Goliath is that you can expect to win. The pleasure of rooting for David is that, while you don't know what to expect, you stand at least a chance of being inspired.\\"<br /><br />Inspiring? I don't think so. But \\"Moneyball\\" is certainly illuminating, and if Beane comes across in retrospect as a manic somewhat tied down by his own dogmas, Lewis emerges as the leading practitioner of the New New Journalism, writing about the most arcane facts in a way akin to the breeziest fiction read.

B00005JO20|4.0|\\"King Kong\\" is the umpteenth remake of the 1933 film that starred Fay Wray as a starlet who wins the heart of a wild giant ape, leading to his destruction at the hands of civilized men. Peter Jackson directed and co-wrote this 2005 version of the story, which takes advantage of major improvements in visual effects technology over the past 70 years to create a giant ape whose emotions are more recognizable and sympathetic than in ever before. In Depression-era New York City, Carl Denham (Jack Black) -filmmaker, profiteer, con artist, and \\"preening self-promoter\\"- has worn his financiers' patience thin with his extravagant vision for a romantic adventure film. They pull their financial backing, and Carl absconds with his footage, determined to shoot his film on a legendary remote island -legend of his own making. He spots Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a struggling vaudeville performer, on the street and thinks she would be a fine leading actress. Ann signs on only because her favorite playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) is writing the script. Cast and crew set sail on a cargo ship captained by a German named Englehorn (Thomas Kretschmann), a trafficker in exotic animals, ostensibly bound for Singapore, but actually in search of someplace more sinister.<br /><br />\\"King Kong\\" is a film in 3 or 4 acts, depending upon how you count. The first and last take place in New York City, as Carl Denham pulls his cast and crew together and, finally, when he brings \\"King Kong: Eighth Wonder of the World\\" to the public. These segments are terrific. Jack Black lends Denham the right amounts of humor and unbridled ambition, and the city anchors the film in the real world. The discord and intrigue on the ship as it sails for anywhere exotic, dangerous, and far away from authorities is also interesting. But most of the action in \\"King Kong\\" takes place on Skull Island, where all manner of monster live and thrive, including a fearsome  25-foot gorilla that the native humans call \\"Kong\\". This is where we get to know King Kong and watch the intrepid filmmakers burn a lot of calories evading huge, hungry, computer generated beasts. Some of this is good, but there's too much of it -to the point of camp. The giant bugs sequence would have been better omitted, for example, as it's ridiculous (intentionally) and holds up the main storyline to no purpose.<br /><br />That said, the relationship between Ann and Kong is terrific. Kong's emotions seem real. His eyes aren't quite life-like, but they're trying to be. \\"King Kong\\" wouldn't be as good without its superb supporting cast, so I want to mention Evan Parke as the philosophical veteran ship's mate Mr. Hayes, Colin Hanks as Preston the sound man, and Kyle Chandler as vain leading man Bruce Baxter. The entire cast does a great job of bringing credibility and humor to a story of man-eating monsters and a besotted gorilla.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2006 single disc): \\"A Volkswagen Touareg and King Kong\\" (2 min) is a behind-the-scenes look at filming a VW Touareg commercial.

6305313687|5.0|\\"American History X\\" da la raz?n a quienes defienden que la violencia, cuando es bien llevada al cine, produce obras altamente recomendables. \\"American...\\" es una pel?cula s?per violenta, que tiene escenas que pueden llegar a herir la susceptibilidad de muchos espectadores, junto con un clima de tensi?n constante alrededor de los personajes de la historia. Sin embargo, ni un s?lo segundo de la violencia y tensi?n presentado en el film sale sobrando. Todo es parte de un cuadro perfecto que se va armando como un rompecabezas, paso a paso y sin dejar una fisura en una historia muy s?lida.<br /><br />Las ideas radicalmente racistas del personaje principal (Derek Vinyard), siendo tan controversiales llevan necesariamente al espectador a tomar una posici?n (en contra, ?espero!). Sin embargo, como la historia es atemporal, las piezas del rompecabezas van apareciendo de a pocos, mostr?ndonos las razones y motivaciones detr?s de Derek Vinyard. Nada es gratuito, todo va encajando, hasta formar el cuadro completo.<br /><br />Repasemos la historia: Derek Vinyard (extraordinaria actuaci?n de Ed Norton), es un muchacho algo t?mido aunque bastante inteligente, que tras la muerte de su padre en manos de un grupo de negros en California, es apadrinado por un inteligente agitador convirti?ndose en l?der de un grupo neo-nazi (skin heads). El brutal asesinato de dos negros lo lleva a la c?rcel, donde la poca convicci?n de los skin-heads hacia sus ideales neo-nazis, aunados a una amistad con un negro, lo llevar? a replantearse las ideas que con tanta pasi?n defend?a. Al salir de prisi?n, encontrar? a su hermano menor siguiendo sus mismos pasos. Ahora los neo-nazis est?n tras de ?l, y tiene muy poco tiempo para salvar su vida, cambiarle la mentalidad a su hermano y reorientar el destino de su familia.<br /><br />Las tres etapas de la vida de Vinyard, est?n genialmente representados por Norton: una primera etapa (apenas un par de escenas) en la que se muestra un muchacho t?mido, estudiante de universidad, no tan claro en sus ideas, pero con much?simo potencial para salir adelante. Una segunda etapa como skin-head, en la que la fuerza que Norton le imprime a su personaje es impresionante. Todo un l?der de su grupo llevado por su odio a todo aquel que no pertenezca a su etnia (white american people, traducido en la cinta simplemente como los \\"blancos\\"). Norton es aqu? un tonel de combustible a punto de estallar en cada segundo del film. Finalmente la tercera etapa en la que el ya salio de la c?rcel, ya modific? su concepto de vida y sigue siendo una persona de car?cter bastante fuerte, pero con ideas y actitudes mucho m?s centradas, m?s pensante, y dispuesto a pagar su deuda con la sociedad.<br /><br />Los personajes secundarios est?n muy bien dise?ados y tambi?n encajan a la perfecci?n. Edward Furlong (a quien muchos recordaran por su papel en Terminator 2) hace una muy respetable actuaci?n como el hermano menor de Norton, fuerte en sus ideas y conceptos, aunque claramente confundido cada vez que los contrasta con su hermano quien adem?s es su ?dolo. Beverly D'Angelo como la madre que no tiene una idea de como corregir el desastre de vida que lleva ella y su familia y que se ha puesto cada vez m?s cuesta arriba desde la muerte de su esposo.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|The DVD is exceptional. The 2-Disc edition is worth it - I am only half-way through the Production Diaries on disc 2 and am so glad I sprung for it - can't wait to see the NY & Skull Island documentaries which are also on the disc. I don't think the Trailer is on either disc tho - too bad. If you're not a fan of the digital \\"process\\", get the single-disc edition. But I am absolutely amazed at how they did it all: just like the special features on the 1933 re-release DVD had me in awe of how the original film was created (that's a must-buy as well). I was worried that knowing how they did \\"things\\" would spoil the film, but the actors (except for Naomi Watts) already did that (haha). Kong is so real and convincing...the ending will break your heart everytime. No real spoiler here, but when Naomi walks into Brophy's arms at the end, I'm like No! Thelma! Jump off after Kong instead! Don't settle for a chimp! What an ending that would have been, huh?
B000AARKO4|5.0|Kingdom of Heaven is my favorite movie for many reasons.  I am a history major, so I look for historical accuracy, and while it is not perfectly accurate historically, it does capture the moment very well.  While Balion was actually step-father to Sibylla's half sister, and Sibylla was actually madly in love with Guy, and a few other historically incorrect relationships and events take place, the major theme is very true historically.  I also love how religeon is handled in this movie and was pleased to see how level-headed the film makers had remained in their portrayals of Muslims and Christians, creating heros and villians on both sides.  The over all plot is amazing and is a thrill for the senses-I am very impressed cinematically.  The costumes, weaponry, and scenery used as superior, and I cannot think of any true flaws in it--5 stars!
0812968255|3.0|Not a literal translation, but a conjecture of what Hays believes Marcus Aurelius should have said, albeit arranged in modern English.  For a more accurate and idiomatic translation accompanied by the Greek manuscript printed beside it, see \\"Marcus Aurelius\\" edited and translated by C.R.

As long as you are willing to overlook some archaic language employed here, such as \\"thou\\" and \\"thy,\\" you would not find a more faithful translation than this.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This was such an awesome movie. I am a die hard final fantasy 7 fan and Cloud is one of my all time favorites. The computer animation is awesome and This is the first film i have ever seen such great graphics. now I do admit the story was a little off from the game, but overall the action sequences and the casting of the characters themselves was very well done. It is a must see movie for final fantasy fans and anime lovers.
B00005R24G|4.0|I had always heard what an amazing stage actor that Olivier was, but his film work has always left me a little cold. I had no idea of what a tour de force he could put on until I watched this delightfully poisonous film. Olivier is like an erudite Robin Williams, full of force and energy, switching gears personas and accents, and generally being quite talented.<br /><br />Caine is no shrinking violet either, and it's a pleasure to see him in his youthful reptilian vigor here.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have never been a huge fan of Johnny Cash and that my taste in music runs to Classical, so I am not a likely target for this movie.  However, I want to tell you that I liked it very much.  The movie portrays Cash as a very complex freight train of talent and emotion that is on some very loose and greased tracks ready to careen off a precipice at any moment.  The Cash in the movie had a certain kind of strength on stage, but off stage was something more like a black hole of emotional needs.  Of course, some would say that someone who needs all that approbation on stage is likely going to keep need it when the curtain falls and the lights are off.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job of pulling of this man's very unique look and sound and facial expressions.  But it is more than a simple imitation or even \\"channeling\\" Cash as so many have said.  You can look at the actor's face and tell what Cash is feeling and trying to put into thoughts and when he fails to find the right thoughts, he erupts in frustration.  Just a superb job of acting and a tribute to Cash.<br /><br />Ginnifer Goodwin does a fine job in making Cash's first wife sympathetic, understandable, and yet never quite a victim.  We understand why the marriage broke down and why it started badly with different expectations from two very different people.  However, Cash's vast emotional needs and charisma seems to have drawn her in, but the pressures and storms that come with the huge fame Cash gained are not compatible with the kind of domesticity Vivian wanted.<br /><br />The person that Cash finally met, wanted, and needed as June Carter.  She had her own baggage coming from \\"Country Music Royalty\\" and a couple of bad marriages.  However, she seems to have had greater intellectual clarity and was probably smarter than Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon gives a wonderful performance that wins our sympathy and helps focus our own attitudes towards the storms in Cash's life at any given moment in the film.<br /><br />Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne add just the right touches as Cash's parents Ray and Carrie Cash.  Patrick has to provide the foundation for Cash's emotional insecurity and Lynne the music for him to cling to for emotional sustenance.<br /><br />This is a much better movie than I expected and I am glad that they left things complex and mixed rather than trying to turn this into a moralizing or cautionary story - though there are moral issues and cautionary lessons to draw aplenty.<br /><br />Enjoy.sh's life at any given moment in the film. <br /> <br />Robert Patrick and Shelby Lynne add just the right touches as Cash's parents Ray and Carrie Cash.

0784011710|5.0|No exaggeration: This movie features the most sublime, nuanced performance by an actress I have ever seen.<br /><br />For the first half of the film, Meryl Streep is utterly convincing as a mysterious Polish woman living in New York after WWII. Midway through the film, she plays an earlier, very different version of her character in a concentration camp in Auschwitz. I won't bother ladling on the superlatives; Meryl rocks, and she has never rocked harder than in this role.<br /><br />As for the rest, Kevin Kline does a good job being alternately charming and swarthily menacing, and Peter Macnichol is his usual useless adenoidal self. (Is he three feet tall?) Trust me, it's all about Meryl: And that is more than enough.
0385334206|5.0|This is one of Vonnegut's best novels, an unusual combination of grimness, social critique, and sardonic humor.  There are three main characters.  Dwayne Hoover is a successful car salesman, but also a man that is slipping into madness.  The second character is Vonnegut alter ego Kilgore Trout, the little-known sci-fi writer of interesting ideas and sloppy prose.  The last character is Vonnegut himself.  Vonnegut not only inserts his thoughts into the novel, but towards the end openly debates how to proceed with the story - providing a powerful end to the book.  Naturally, these pages also combine Vonnegut-style philosophy, thoughts about free will, and social critique of the USA circa 1973.   This book doesn't have a strong plot, and falls a bit short of the author's SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, but it's a powerful read nevertheless.
B00008973Q|4.0|RAN epitomizes the type of film that can alternately inspire and infuriate the viewer. I am an admirer of the director's work, and here, the sheer spectacle of medieval Japan enraptures the viewer: The stunning vistas, the sweep of the battle field, and the glorious architecture.<br /><br />BUT the centerpiece of the film is the internal conflict of the Great Lord as he staggers through the shattered landscape of his former empire. His pernicious babbling and outrageous overacting are amusing in a Kabuki/vaudeville way, but ultimately prove somewhat tedious. Since it's common knowledge that the story is based on KING LEAR, I'm not giving anything away by saying that when the Great Lord finally breathes his last, the viewer breathes a sigh of relief.
B0000DIXDR|4.0|I give this movie and the DVD package 4 stars. The music was powerful and the love story between Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze was a powerful one and the acting performances by all involved were completely believable.<br /><br />Now for the DVD itself. If you own the Collectors Edition and you're wondering whether or not you would want this version there should be only one thing to take into account....how good is your home theatre system?<br /><br />If you have a 5.1-7.1 home theatre system then I would highly recommend buying this version, the DTS:ES 6.1 discreet audio track is more visceral than the Dolby Digital 5.1EX track and with almost twice the bit rate you're getting nearly twice the information. This means that you're listening to something that's more accurately reproducing the original studio masters of the audio with less compression than the Dolby track.<br /><br />If you already own the collectors edition and you're watching your DVDs through either just your television, a two channel stereo or with a receiver that only supports Dolby Digital or Dolby Pro Logic/Pro Logic II then I would say to be sated with the version you already have. There is not much more that this DVD covers with the interviews and features that, after watching the collectors edition, you would care to see.
B0008ISM40|1.0|I have been a NIN fan since Pretty Hate Machine. I think Trent Reznor is a brilliant musician. All of his previous albums have been absolute genius....until this? I pre-ordered this album anticipating another masterpiece. What a disappointment!! I still can't get over how terrible this album is! The only song that is worth mentioning is \\"You Know What You Are.\\" That's the Trent I know! I purposely skipped the tour just so I didn't have to hear the new stuff! I hope this isn't it for him, but I will be cautious when the next album comes out!
B0009K7QZ8|3.0|Let me start by saying the first season.... IS PURE GENIUS!  I love it love it love it.  The season finale made me cry!  It was a great season so go out and buy that one.  Having said that let me start with the second season was NO WHERE NEAR as good as the first season.  There are whole episodes in this season that are just a total bore.  There are a few good toward the end, but the whole middle of the season when ryan is dating lindsey and they find out lindsey is calebs daughter... all of that is boooooring.  The season only starts getting good after Rainy Day Women and even after that there are some dull episodes!  All in all i LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE the OC its a really good show.  Although lately i've been watching it more out of habit than it being a good show.  The third season so far is not really good altho it is just now starting to get good.  Figures that would start happening with only 5 episodes left! LOL But all in all the first half of the second season not worth it.. the second half is aight
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Excellent job. It is easy to see the energy and effort put into remaking this epic.<br />The only reason I go with 4 star instead of 5 is simply because somehow the blending of live action and CGI as good as it is, still seems to be missing some sort of realism I can't put into words.<br />The original as crude as it may seem by today's standards still tugs at the emotions more than this hi-tech version.<br />There is still something about CGI no matter how good it is that seems to emotionally seperate you from the character and not accept them as real somehow.<br /><br />But this IS the best CGI ever put on film hands down !!!<br />This is a great film that will be added to my DVD collection.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|It is a shame that Queen of the Stone Age's LULLABIES TO PARALYZE was over look amidst the other releases of 2005. Aside from a strong #5 debut on the Billboard 200, the albums numbers went nowhere but downhill from there. It is sad considering this is an incredibly strong album that any alt-metal lover would love.<br /><br />The album grabs your attention instantly as it starts with baritone vocals by Mark Lanegan on the exceptional \\"This Lullaby\\".  Perhaps one of the biggest hits of the album is within the intially bluesy \\"Everybody Knows That You're Insane\\" which then evolves into a 4/4 rocking affair.  Following that is another equally brillaint \\"Tangled Up In Plaid\\", which both tracks featuring the tenor vocals of frontman Josh Homme.  What follows then is the great \\"Burn The Witch\\", which easily gets stuck in the listener's head.  Other hits include \\"Little Sister\\" (a Grammy nominated track I believe), \\"I Never Came\\", and \\"Someone's In The Wolf\\".<br /><br />The production is exceptional and has an old school rock feel, more bluesy than typical rock or metal albums.  Overall, this is an album that those metal fans who didn't buy it really missed out on. If you invest your money into LULLABIES TO PARALYZE, you wont be disappointed in the least. 4 stars.
B0002234LS|2.0|I'm of the opinion that King's books rarely translate well into movies, and this is no exception. Some of King's work is fantastic,  but unfortunately, a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new. This falls into the latter category. <br /> <br />A novel about a novelist, and one who has a hard time finding inspiration: Please Mr. King, which college creative writing program did you steal this idea from? The writer's ideas showing up in real life: From whence do these fantastic ideas pour forth? <br /> <br />I won't bother to tell you the ending, because if you have the poor luck to watch the movie, you'll have already guessed it by the time you're half way through. It's all bad and hackneyed, from start to finish. <br /> <br />I will give Steven King credit for putting his fame to good use though. If anyone without Mr. King's fame and built-in fan base tried to sell a story this trite, their manuscript would never make it through the slush pile.  <br /> <br />Maybe it takes a bunch of bad stories like this to turn out gems like the Gunslinger series, but it doesn't mean that we have to watch them.
0684859106|3.0|I consider myself to be an avid and skilled baker/cook. I have been baking and cooking successfully for well over 22 years. I got this book and MORE FROM MAGNOLIA as gifts from a friend who is a big fan of the cupcakes at the Magnolia Bakery in New York. I was very careful to follow the recipes exactly and I most certainly am not a beginner. The first recipe I tried was Magnolia's Vanilla Cupcakes. The cupcakes turned out okay; a bit on the dry side and I would have used maybe a bit more vanilla. I tried two more recipes (Devil's Food Cupcakes and Chocolate Buttermilk Layer Cake) just to give the books the benefit of the doubt. I used only the freshest, highest quality ingredients and I was extra conscientious when following the recipes and the results were still mediocre. The cupcakes were dry and the layer cake was bland. Old-fashioned is a quality I like in my baking but dry and bland are qualities no one likes. I have heard so much praise about the goods at the Magnolia Bakery that it leads me to wonder if the recipes in the cookbooks have been adjusted to turn out inferior results. The book itself is easy to follow, well-written, and laid out neatly. The lack of so many pictures did not bother me at all and the pictures they did include were beautiful and attractive. But the recipes are what matters the most in any cookbook. The results have been consistently just okay. I really expected a lot but I'm sorry to say I'm disappointed.
B00005JKQ6|4.0|Directed by Frank Perry (\\"Mommie Dearest\\" and \\"Father of the Bride\\") and based on a short story by John Cheever, \\"The Swimmer,\\" through intriguing is a strange movie indeed. It stars Burt Lancaster, who wears only a snug bathing suit-- if he wears one at all-- for the entire movie. The plot is straight forward. Lancaster (Ned Merrill) visits friends who have a pool and decides that he can swim all the way home just by visiting all the homes in the valley (upper middle class Westport Connecticut) until he swims home to his darling \\"Lucinda\\" and his two beloved daughters. The viewer soon learns, however, that all is not well in suburbia. Ned apparently has lost a job or been demoted, he owes several of his swimming-pool-owning former friends money. He also runs into a nymphet, a former baby sitter, who reveals that she always had a crush on him, and also a former lover (\\"you suburban stud\\"). We watch this man's life unravel before us. While he may be guilty of a lot of things, he is portrayed in a very sympathetic light. Certainly he should not miss all the brittle so-called former friends he meets on his journey. The final image of the film is quite disturbing.<br /><br />Here we see the American dream turned in on itself and another Willie Loman whose life is in shatters.<br /><br />Parts of the movie defy credibility. There is no way a person could walk through lawns, forests and cross highways and have his barefeet not bleeding. Ned's feet for the most part escape unscathed.<br /><br />This 1968 film is certainly worth seeing or revisiting, if you have seen it previously.
B00005JOWR|5.0|Based on a best-selling 'insider' novel of the same name, this film examines how the multi-million dollar tobacco industry promises one thing to the public and then privately does another.<br /><br />People who would be 'crying foul' with almost any other industry are actually convinced the tobacco industry is on their side. It is an unspoken truth that Big Tobacco's 'anti-smoking' initiatives are actually enticing kids to try--and become hooked on their products. Constantly producing a new generation of consumers (especially important when you are producing a product whose only result is to kill people!) is very important for this industry.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor, Vice President of and the chief spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, a tobacco lobby funded by cigarette companies to \\"research\\" the links between smoking cigarettes and health. Naturally because this is an in-industry organization, no links are ever made--and his other job requires him to defend 'smokers rights'.<br /><br />After a 'skull and crossbones' bill is proposed, Nick suggests that Hollywood do their part to publicize smoking again, people seeing their favorite stars light up will think it is 'cool'. The dichotomy between this, his membership in the self-referenced Merchants Of Death (M.O.D. Squad) and then attempts to build a loving relationship with his son Joey (Cameron Bright) are wide. He is not a moral man, but Naylor is not subhuman scum either.<br /><br />Other powerful performances are delivered by Katie Holmes. She plays investigative reporter Heather Holloway, skeptical of M.O.D. Squad. An article she writes ultimately allows Nick to really light up his son's life.<br /><br /> Everybody needs to see this film at least once if they want to understand the full power of marketing upon the human psyche and the political power of effective advertising. This film isn't an anti or pro-smoking diatribe so much as an examination of industry marketing techniques with the industry being examined just happening to be tobacco.try marketing techniques with the industry being examined just happening to be tobacco. <br />
0684824906|3.0|Goodwin's attention to the personality of Lincoln and his cabinet members makes a fascinating study.  Her interest in Lincoln's peculiar brand of leadership--one that relied on hearing and accommodating views contradictory to his own--seems timely given our quite different presidential leadership.  Though this book makes a solid and important contribution to Lincoln scholarship however, I could not help wondering the whereabouts of Goodwin's editor.  Given what is already out there about Lincoln, this book could have been sharp and incisive.  Instead, it stretches on for pages and pages offering exactly the same level of detail about everything.  Goodwin probably wanted the word \\"comprehensive\\" to appear in reviews, and she achieved that.  Yet, much of the detail here seemed the same flavor and color as the rest.  Maybe I am the only history reader who resents a book that is longer than it need be and perhaps I should be ashamed for asking for less from such an accomplished book, but I do.  Isn't focusing on the essential and most telling a measure of artistry as well?
0783225849|5.0|(After watching this movie for the 50th time, I decided to toss my hat and write a review on Psycho)<br /><br />This is simply put: A classic from Hitchcock. While it may not be \\"terrifying\\" or \\"skary\\" about Psycho, it's still a classic film and has a message about, well, psychology. I'm too lazy to remember the character's names, so sue me! Psycho has the classic shower murder scene with the screeching violins that everyone knws, but no one knows what movie it's from. The ending is VERY shocking: Somehow, Norman's dead mother (ok, so that's the only name I remeber right now) took over his part of his mind. Whenever Norman feels the lust for another woman, which could take her precious Norman away from her, the mother takes over and goes on a murderous rampage (or whenever she feels threatened).<br /><br />I reccomend this to not just horror fans, but to anyone who is looking for a solid and entertaining movie. It has a strong and twisted message about psychology, but you won't have to think too hard about what it means- it all wraps up at the end. Highly reccomended!<br /><br />Don't keep Mother waiting...
B0000029DD|5.0|I just had to have my say on 'Grace', although any comment I could possibly make about it has already been made somewhere in the 500+(!!) reviews already writen. <br /> <br />I first heard this album when I was sixteen and had just broken up with my first love.  It was a major turning point for me musically, in fact I would say it was one of two major defining moments that I have experienced in music.   <br /> <br />It's not for everyone, obviously.  My fiance can't stand it (though I think he's just jealous, thinks I love JB more than him) and some friends have commented that his voice sounds too much like Elvis for them.  Can't hear it myself, but everyone's different. <br /> <br />So if you'd like to possibly experience a Defining MOment in Music, try this.
B00005JOEA|5.0|Great movie, for once there is a movie that makes you think about the future of the government, and what could happen.  Vengence isn't the only thing the movie is about.  It's also about people standing together against a government out of control.
B0009YA386|5.0|Interpol are good but Editors are *great*. Their songs tug at my heart and make me want to cry for loves lost in the past - I don't know why but something about this album catches me in my throat and I feel the tears begin to prick behind my eyelids. I was once fantastically in love with a man who introduced me to the Chameleons - I suppose that Editors is the closest I have heard to the type of music that anchors me to that particularly strong emotion. I can't describe this album with the words that it deserves - please listen to it and don't compare it to anyone else; if you know Interpol already, Editors may be too 'samey' to you. If you like Editors and want some more (slightly second rate) of the same, try Interpol. Either way, enjoy.

B000002UVX|5.0|In Jimi Hendrix's later years, he was looking to explore other things, so he went away from the Experience, and formed a new group that he would jam with and tour on a constant basis. This group was called \\"Band of Gypsys\\". Featuring himself, drummer Buddy Miles and bassist Billy Cox, the guys worked together to produce ecstatic, wild, lengthy rock jams, all in fairly good taste. This new found style enabled Hendrix to be even more edgy with his guitar. The exceptional work done by this band is captured in this live 6 song, 45 minute album.<br /><br />The set opens with a smooth, artsy song called \\"Who Knows\\". Jimi Hendrix drives this song along in a slow, groovy fashion and it works beautifully. \\"Machine Gun\\" is the most cherished song on here for myself. It's a 12 minute all out rocker, with sheer intensity and fury. Hendrix creates the ugly imagery with his guitar, unloading gunshots with his guitar. In my opinion, this track features one of his most creative and best guitar solo of his career. \\"Changes\\" is a nice change of mood (written by Miles) from the heavy Machine Gun, and it features some of the best vocals on the album. \\"Power To Love\\" has a heavier feel to it, with Hendrix singing out the solos and riffs in familiar fashion. \\"Message To Love\\" became a live standard for Hendrix in his later days, and this is an excellent performance. The song features a catchy melody, and Miles offers excellent backing vocals. \\"We Gotta Live Together\\" is the other track composed by Buddy Miles, and closes out the set. The band gets the crowd involved in this pretty rocker, with beautiful vocals.<br /><br />While Jimi Hendrix may have established himself through three excellent studio albums with The Experience, he enjoyed some of his best days in this band. This live album captures Jimi Hendrix's diverting side, simply playing for the sheer pleasure of it. The band had an unbreakable chemistry, and one can only wonder what may have been achieved had Hendrix lived on. If you are a Hendrix fan, do yourself and rock history a favour by buying this live album. Highly recommended.If you are a Hendrix fan, do yourself and rock history a favour by buying this live album. Highly recommended.
1594200823|4.0|I never gave much thought to seeing so much corn growing in Ohio, but come to think of it, I really never have seen many other crops aside from some soybeans.  Until I read \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma : A Natural History of Four Meals\\", I had only the vaguest idea what \\"they\\" did with all that corn.  Sure, I knew they made artificial sugar for soft drinks from the stuff.  And there's margarine. And there's corn on the cob.  But that can't explain why there's so much corn being grown. Until Pollan set me straight, I had no idea that corn was the \\"vinyl\\" of foodstuffs, that it permeates the entire food chain, and that every piece of meat we eat is \\"corn-fed.\\"    Jeez, I thought cows ate grass.  I think I was 40 years behind the times, and I thank Michael Pollan for educating me about our industrial food chain, its vulnerabilities and its hidden costs. <br /> <br />An otherwise fascinating and readable book is marred by numerous typographical and factual errors, unfortunately.  For example, \\"Muscles\\" instead of \\"Mussels\\"  - even a city boy knows the difference.  And why does Pollan think Carbon is the most common element in the human body?  Excluding Hydrogen, wouldn't it be Oxygen? -  since we're mostly water? <br /> <br />Many thanks to NPR's \\"Fresh Air\\" (April 11, 2006) for introducing me to the book and author.

B000EJ9VUW|1.0|After getting through the Liars' painfully dull new concept album, Drum's Not Dead, which appears to be based on the interactions between two fictional characters, Drum and Mt. Heart Attack, it occurred to me that the reason for the conspicious lack of musical excitement - forget about tunes - on these 12 tracks is might be that all the dreary fuzzed-out-thudding was meant to serve as background noise for the video clips on the companion DVD. It's just the sort of thing you might expect from a group that heard a Faust MP3 and decided to leave their cozy Williamsburg hangout to seek a hipper recording vibe in Germany. <br />The bad news is that the three-part video component, The Helix Aspersa, by Liars main man Angus Andrew, Drum's Not Bread, by drummer Julian Gross and By Your Side, courtesy of filmmaker Markus Wambsganss - which amounts to three different sets of clips to correspond with each track on the album - is even more mindnumbingly boring than the snooze-inducing sonic clatter. We're talking time-lapse images of cloud formations and a snail crawling. To say that the results come across like the embarrassing experiments of college freshmen would be giving these jokers too much credit for this half-assed load of twaddle. Pointing a camera at the sky to capture passing clouds or focusing on a slowly creeping snail doesn't even qualify as Sprockets material. <br />
B0002849HK|4.0|\\"Gothika\\" is one of those movies that is not as bad as you heard that it was, although certainly it has some major problems. For one thing the movie tries so relentlessly to be eerie with all the spooky lighting and music that it threatens to be carried along by the style rather than the substance. Then there is the fact that we know that in the \\"real world\\" a prison psychiatrist is not going to end up in the same prison where they practiced if the world decides that they are insane. Doing so would mess up the treatment of every patient she had been working with, so we know that Halle Berry's Miranda Grey is there for a reason, which gets us thinking ahead of the plot and trying to figure out whodunnit. Is director Mathieu Kassovitz being so heavy handed that he is obvious or is he skillfully setting up a red herring? Good question. You can answer it for yourself after you see the film.<br /><br />Miranda is a psychiatrist in a dark and dreary prison where we are introduced to her as she is working with patient Chloe Sava (Penelope Cruz). Miranda seems clinical and cool, if not cold. One of the other staff psychiatrists, Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.) seems interested in her, but she has recently wed her boss, Dr. Douglas Grey (Charles S. Dutton). That night, after taking a swim in the prison pool, she drives home during a thunderstorm and is forced to take a detour. The figure of a ghostly girl appears in the middle of the road and Miranda crashes her car. Miranda tries to help the girl, who looks like she has been the victim of something horrible, but then the girl bursts into flames. The next thing Miranda knows she wakes up a prisoner in her own institution where she is told by Pete that she has been accused of brutally murdering her husband with an axe. Miranda remembers nothing.<br /><br />Chloe explains to Miranda that once you are declared to be officially insane anything you say will automatically be considered to be the ravings of a lunatic. Miranda is put in the impossible position of convincing her captors that she is sane. However, that is really not much of a problem because she is so distraught and confused that she convinces both herself and the viewers that maybe she is insane, and if that is true, then maybe it is true that she killed her husband. Berry's performance bounces back and forth between screaming hysteria and a guarded detachment in an effort to survive everything that is being thrown at her by not only the authorities trying to convict her of murder but also of her own mind. For those that thought Berry's Oscar for \\"Monster's Ball\\" did not prove she was a real actress, \\"Gothika\\" proves she is clearly more than a pretty face.<br /><br />There is a paradox in this film, what some may consider a fatal flaw, in that in the final analysis all of the pieces do not fit. Even once you know what is going on it does not really explain everything that is happening. Watch the film a second time and you will see this is clearly the case. However I think this was really more a question of keeping us guessing rather than having problems with story construction. Kassovitz and screenwriter Sebastian Gutierrez are developing a sense of mystery and terror that literally extends to the end of the film where the final scene provides another piece of what is really an unfinished puzzle. Listen to Kassovitz's commentary on this DVD and he will repeatedly talk about what they did to make individual scenes scary, without a clear regard for what it meant for the logic of the film. Either you buy into the end result or this movie is going to grossly offend you. There probably is not going to be any middle ground on this one.<br /><br />Final Note: Kassovitz earns points by filming a group shower scene with Berry, Cruz, and over a dozen other women that is totally in keeping with the atmosphere of the film. These women are all naked, but the scene is filmed in such a way that they are not nude (that will make sense when yousee it). When that scene started I was mentally rolling my eyes at what I thought was going to be coming up next and Kassovitz simply did not go there. In a world of gratuitous sex and violence, the way he presented this scene was something to see.e when you see it). When that scene started I was mentally rolling my eyes at what I thought was going to be coming up next and Kassovitz simply did not go there.

1592402038|4.0|Today, as I'm writing this review, this book is ranked number 743 on Amazon. This is very disappointing to me. Not because this book is bad, but because another is so much better.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I really like Eats, Shoots & Leaves and think most of the extremely critical reviews are just goofy. However, I absolutely LOVE another book called Grammar Gremlins written by Don Ferguson. It's both fun and memorable, but, alas, it is ranked number 770,669 today. Does this mean I'm wrong and that Grammar Gremlins is a \\"bad\\" book? Here's a thought: Buy it and then contact me if you disagree. I've recommended Grammar Gremlins to people in my training classes for years and the feedback, with rare exceptions, has been wonderful.<br /><br />I guess I would buy both of the books, but I would uses Grammar Gremlins more as a reference instead of a \\"once read\\".<br /><br />These are my thoughts and I hope they help you make a decision.<br /><br />Tom Carpenter

Whether fans of Grateful Dead, Iron Butterfly, Black Sabbath, King Crimson, Bob Dylan, Doors, Uriah Heep, Jethro Tull - this album found its way into their stacks. Those who haven't made it their own, are the less for it.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|This is as far from \\"one of the best or perhaps the best thrillers of all time\\" as you can get. Wanna see a really great, suspenseful thriller? Try David Lynch's Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive. This isn't it. It's extremely typical, geared towards gore hungry audiences while not really being extremely gory. The best part of the entire movie were the girls (I'll admit, that alone may be worth the ticket price), but don't expect anything extremely original here. This is basically Saw (which was much better) with a location change and more people involved in making it happen. Long story short, a rental at best.

B000053VAF|5.0|Just a 55 yr old Christian woman, checking out Saturday afternoon movies....stumbled on this funny, deep, irreligious, sacred, LONG, thoughtful and very enjoyable movie.  Maybe I was just in a whacky mood, but why not?  Why can't God be a woman and angels walk among us, etc?  \\"Thank GOD\\" I can look at all angles of my religion and enjoy what others think without being offended and prissy!!!!  Yes...there was some language...the same that I hear every day and sometimes emit myself! I laughed myself silly and cried a little ,too, while I watched this alone. I will buy this to share with my husband and family and especially my 16 year old daughter who is making her own religious self examinations and finding what she's comfortable with right now.  Thank you for the wonderful writing, directing, and acting.  Everyone in the cast did a fine job.  To all you prissies:  Let yourself go and think about things,even if you can't bring yourself to talk about them openly. (Someone might laugh at you !!!???) God loves you and wants you to experiment with her love and your place in her world.
B000059XUO|3.0|I have seen this film-labeled the best one, and the 4th Crow movie-labeled the worst one at pretty much the same time. And I just gotta say, I was pretty disappointed with both, but especially this one, which has been labeled the best Crow film and it's soooooo good and a must see etc etc etc. Needless to say, my expectations for this film is pretty high.    So here's my comparason of The Crow and The Crow: Wicked Prayer:    But when I saw the film, I was pretty much cringing for most of the way through. First of all there was Brandon Lee's acting. he wasn't so much as \\"the crow\\" as \\"the clow\\", or more accurately, \\"the Joker\\". Edward Furlong had a much cooler \\"The Crow\\" look, while Brandon Lee's Crow look is pretty much like a clow, it was a really ridiculous look. And secondly, if I had to compare acting, I would choose Edward Furlong for he had more character depth than Brandon Lee (and just on a side-note, I'm not a fan of Edward Furlong, I didn't even know him until I saw the fourth crow movie). Furlong pulled off the Crow as someone who is deeply confused, and was despairing over what he had become, and even resisted his undead-ness. Brandon Lee, on the other hand, fully embraced his power to create havoc, and was pretty sadistic most of the time throughout the film(especially when he was telling people to shoot him-I was cinging like heck) (hence making him more \\"the joker\\" for me). Furlong had some pretty good lines, Lee, on the other hand, the only line that gave me a few chuckles was when he told the cop \\"your hat is still on\\", all his other lines are really cheesy, and he failed to show me how he brought people together by using his wisdom. So basically, I felt Furlong was a better crow in looks, character depth and cunning speeches, and he kills the bad guys in rage(which made me feel more for his revenge). While Lee was pretty much a crazy and at many times pathetic clow killing people sadistically(which pretty much made me cringe).    So that said, whatare the things this movie is better than the fourth one?? There are lots- mainly the violence. Lee's Crow had pretty creative plots for each of the people he's gonna kill. The film is also much much darker and set in a feeling of sad, dangerous, yet at the same time sacrete place. So needless to say, this move definitely had the best action.    As for the plot. both films, in my opinion, are equal in different way. And I pretty much mean the villains. This movie's villains were pretty over the top. The ending-how the crow killed the guy, is creative but didn't work as well-it got kinda destroyed when he thanked the cop-gosh I was literally screaming CHEESY!!! the fourth crow movie's villain wasn't great either, and also pretty cheesy, but at least in the fourth crow movie the villains were formidable-aka he had power almost equal that of the crow. While this movie the crow kills like everybody, and the resolution of his power being taken away is pretty stupid too-the bird peck the woman's face, geeez I wouldn't have thought of that *sarcasm*    So why do people praise this movie to the stars? Simple, two reasons: 1. this was the first film, and I know about the first initial biase over everything in most people-so basically this was the first crow movie, people loved it(there was this saying that \\"it's always the first one that is the best one\\" but it's just not true, it's because of the first-biase). 2. Brandon Lee lost his life for this movie, yet this movie was still released, I gotta say, that is really impressive.    But I also know that this movie is released in 1994, yeah, that was before Joss Whedon-the master creater of dark themes-and who nowadays pretty much everybody(who tries to make the similar genre) was trying to copy on was known. So it's understandable, but that's pretty much proving what I've always observed-films (in general of course) get BETTER, not worse. Actors get better and better as the generations goes on. In fact, nowadays when I see old movies like Gone With the Wind and the 40s version of Pride and Prejudice, I was literally YELLING how incredibly HORRIBLE the actings are.     So hit at me if you wish, but this is the solid opinion of someone who is completely unbiased. For the viewers: if you really enjoy violence and juss wanna watch violence, this is the movie for you, but if you are looking for something a little more, I suggest you look elsewhere.
1881273156|2.0|I was drawn to this book because the foundation of Dr. Chapman's Five Languages is very simple yet profoundly important. But that being said, this foundation is also little more than common sense. It doesn't take a psychology degree to know that we each have our own values and priorities, and different personal triggers for happiness. My hope for this book was that it would build on my and my husband's Average Jane/Joe common sense and help us understand and practice it more deeply after 10 years of marriage. Unfortunately, what starts off as a great vehicle never quite surpasses 20 miles an hour. This book did a good job of reminding me to recognize and honor differences, but it didn't teach me anything new.<br /><br />The paragraph above would have prompted me to give this book 3 stars (\\"It was OK\\"). But the two paragraphs below tempted me to give it 1 star (\\"Hated it\\"). In the end I'm compromising at 2 stars. There are two things about this book that really bothered me.<br /><br />One: Dr. Chapman seems to live in Disneyland. The contrived Hallmark card image on the book's cover is a good indication that its contents are idealistic rather than realistic. He believes that we can get over years of troubles and pain through exercises that include watching ducks on a lake together, or saying, \\"Thanks in advance for mowing the lawn,\\" instead of \\"I want you to mow the lawn.\\" Is there wisdom to his suggestions? Most certainly. Do they fall short in the real world? Most certainly. One after another, he introduces us to couples who have come to him after decades of misery and threats of divorce, and within just a few months they're walking off into the sunset (presumably the one on the cover) to live Happily Ever After without cracking a sweat. The more of these couples I read about, the more I felt like I was watching \\"The Cosby Show\\" where life's problems are easily solved and everyone plays their part effortlessly because the writer scripted it that way. Dr. Chapman consistently sidesteps the real world where humans are complex and life is inevitably complicated.<br /><br />Two: At nearly the end of the book I became outright enraged, prompting me to write this, my first ever Amazon review. A woman comes to Dr. Chapman and tells him that her husband dismisses her, belittles and insults her, and tells her outright that he hates her. Dr. Chapman asks what her husband's primary language is, and she says it's Physical Touch. He then advises her to have sex with her husband. She protests, saying that sex makes her feel degraded and used as an object because she knows she isn't respected or cared for as a human being. Dr. Chapman persists, telling her (quotes shortened but not taken out of context), \\"Your response is normal. That's why loving someone who doesn't love you is unnatural and difficult. You need to rely on your faith in God to do this. Read Jesus' sermon on loving your enemies and then ask God to help you practice the teachings of Jesus.\\" The woman again protests, saying it would be hypocritical of her to sleep with a man who hates her and whom she may well hate in return. Dr. Chapman persists again, saying, \\"If you claim to have feelings you don't have, that's hypocritical. But if you express an act that is designed for the other person's pleasure, it's simply a choice. Your action isn't born of emotional bonding, it's born of doing something for his benefit. That's what Jesus meant.\\" WHAT?! Jesus wants women to pleasure men for their benefit without regard to emotional bonding?! I'm sorry, I thought that Jesus taught us the opposite. From there, Dr. Chapman tells her that if she gives her husband sex six times in the next month, chances are he'll give her the Thursday evening Scrabble game she wants. I could hardly absorb this justification as I was reading. Dr. Chapman's end conclusion is that his plan is a \\"miracle\\" anyone of us can practice in our own marriage.<br /><br />For many little reasons, and for the one huge reason of the paragraph above, I am dumbfounded that this book has averaged a 5 star rating from more than 300 readers. I find myself deeply dismayed that people are incorporating into their belief systems advice which is so unrealistic, oversimplified, and even outright degrading at times.<br /><br />Again, the foundation of this book is a good one, and it's good to be reminded that we need to see and care about others instead of only ourselves. If only Dr. Chapman would build on this positive in a realistic and respectful way.e huge reason of the paragraph above, I am dumbfounded that this book has averaged a 5 star rating from more than 300 readers.

B00005JOE8|5.0|A+++++++ All the way. This film was excellent in every way possible. Yes it was a little slow in parts but this film blew my mind away. Excellent script, actors and special effects.
0808566474|4.0|I am very conflicted about the book, mainly because Dan Brown uses a theory that has been proven false by reputable historians, and holds this theory up as truth. The idea that this underlying theory is true gives the book much of its gravitas that has elevated it to its best-selling status. That being said this is still a well written thriller that hooks you from the beginning and keeps you turning pages! And in spite of the false premise there is still plenty of history and classical art and architecture to keep it all interesting. My recommendation is read the book, but try and find a used copy--Dan Brown already has enough Money! If you like archeological based thrillers check out \\"Tourist in the Yucatan\\" a Da Vinci Code for the Americas!
1439110123|5.0|The prize was Khuristan. Khuristan provided 90% of Iran's oil. Oil has become another commodity. The myth that oil prices have no limit was quickly dispelled in the early 1980s. Oil does have a price ceiling. If the oil price rose too high the world market will abandoned it, never to return, as it invests in alternate energy infrastructure.<br /><br />Prices in the futures market are influenced by how much the oil commodities cost in the spot market. Traders on the London and New York exchanges influence price through buying and selling oil contracts. Supply and demand are the important factors determining price. The first oil shock kicked as the Shah was deposed of power and Ayatollah Khomeini rise too power disrupted oil production.<br /><br />The second oil shock, the Iraqi-Iran war was characterized by immobilized tankers unable to leave Iraqi ports; 8 mil/bar a day decreased to 1 mil/bar; panicked spot buying in Japan and Europe; US exceeding oil production of Non-Opec locals over OPEC importers; increased US dependence on Alaska, Mexico, and Canadian oil; development of the North Seas Oil production.<br /><br />Carter lobbied congressional proposals for production of synthetic oil from shale and coal. Synthetic fuel costs $18 billion for 500,000 gallons and the cost and its survivability questionable. Iran withstood the first hard attacks by Iraq. Political instability was exploited by the Media and panic set in.<br /><br />However, the world's total oil production was not significantly affected by either of the two shocks. Saudi began escalating its level of daily production and in coordination with other countries exceeded demand. The total amount of daily oil production was about 31 million barrels a day. This was too much supply for the demand. OPEC dropped daily production attempting to soften against a crash in price. OPEC decided price and supply and the oil companies brokered the oil out to world consumers. OPEC wanted a price of $18 a barrel. The price per barrel ranged from $10 to $35 a barrel, a huge increase from the $1.90 a barrel before the shocks. OPEC countries received sudden surge of financial available from banks. The buying spree seemed to have no bounds.<br /><br />Saudi played the role of the swing producer increasing oil inventory supplies offsetting Iran oil production drops. Saudi became the Arab political leader and often competed head to head with Iran.<br /><br />Additional shocks included the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, three-mile island nuclear disaster, and Nixon policy of price fixing. Availability of oil was still plentiful and cheap.<br /><br />What caused the Oil price to rise? Oil traders searched the open market for oil purchases. Japan received 20% of its oil from Iran. BP received 40% of its contracts from Iran. The buyers bought oil now and sold it latter when it was expensive. Oil companies experienced record level profits. The public outrage direct charges at the big oil companies that they caused the shortage. Oil companies defended their position that huge price fluctuations in oil inventories were cyclic and profits were needed to offset drops in price. The oil reserve had billions of gallons of oil in inventory. The oil inventory served to cushion against sudden surges in demand caused from an especially cold winter. The oil companies bought the oil cheap and stored the oil in tankers and oil storage containers and remained fat on the oil. The game increased in danger as the price drove upward and warnings that increasing price could suddenly turn because supply was too large. Political and social instability increased the fear and buyers pushed up price.<br /><br />Federal Monetary policies were rigidly tight, interest rates rose to 21 percent, and recession set in, unemployment rose sharply, and production dropped. As production drop so did the demand for oil. US car increased fuel efficiency 31 percent with cars achieving 27.5 mpg. Japan reached 51 percent fuel efficiency and consumption decreased. The price is a simple function of supply and demand. If supply exceeds demand than the price will drop. The price of oil dropped suddenly and hard.<br /><br />The rich began adding oil commodities to their portfolios. Financial portfolio greedy for big profits increased institutional investing in oil commodities and oil stocks and argued that the investment made sense as a hedge against inflation. Oil profits drove up stock prices. The stock market increased in valuation as a direct result of oil company valuation increases. Gold prices rose as dollars were exchanged for Gold. Gold prices may have drove up oil prices. The drop in oil prices hammer oil profits and investors hung too long and kept their money in oil, for the long haul. New oil exploration and discovery could not displace the king of oil and the seven sisters pushed Saudi center stage exploiting the vast oil reserves of the Middle East.

B00004STPT|5.0|I practically grew up listening to this music! My parents have always been movie-goers and that means, too, that I've heard many of the great soundtracks before the movies. Gladiator was one of these. I find this a great advantage, because my critique of the music was unaffected by remembrances of the screen. My conclusion was that it was excellent, and it has been a main staple of my listening ever since I first heard it. Hans Zimmer is a genius! He keeps a common theme without being overly repetative (an anguish I often suffer from- LOTR, anyone?- though I love it so...). By the way, when I was allowed to see the movie, I was blown away- the songs are so perfect, the images haunt me still. A great CD, and highly recommended.
B00026WUAU|5.0|The lilting ballad Changing Of The Guards opens this underrated 1979 album. The female backing vocals lend a soulful tone to the music here and throughout the album. This R&B/Gospel feel is what sets Street Legal apart from Dylan's more familiar spectrum of styles.<br /><br />New Pony has an even more authentic R&B air about it, whilst the beautifully tuneful No Time To Think is more in his folk-rock vein, but still embellished by the soulful backing voices. It is my favourite and a definite highlight of the album.<br /><br />Baby Stop Crying is a rock ballad with tempo variation and stirring organ, Is Your Love In Vain? is a tender love ballad with a melancholy undertone and Senor is a slow, meandering folk number. The next track sounds the most like early Dylan with those characteristic vocal inflections; True Love Tends To Forget is a mournful lament with an impressive arrangement.<br /><br />The theme on We Better Talk This Over remains mistrust and lost love, but it's a very catchy pop song with hypnotic appeal. The album concludes with a tour de force: Where Are You Tonight?, a flowing uptempo ballad with gripping imagery and an exquisite arrangement.<br /><br />Street Legal is quite underrated in Dylan's body of work. There is no weak track and there are many memorable songs like the aforementioned No Time To Think, Is Your Love In Vain?, True Love Tends To Forget and the final track.<br /><br />Some Dylan fans and critics might have been prejudiced against the R&B sound but it is most authentic and has stood the test of time. Street Legal has definitely improved with age and I consider it to be amongst Dylan's Top 10 albums.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I loved all her albums.. I think all had their high points, although there were usually a few songs I wasn't too fond of, but this is her album which has the best overall quality and cosistancy to me. Each song holds it's own and there's none I'd have to skip past. I can't stop listening to it!  <br /> <br />I think it's so great that she covers many music genre, but each song still has that unique Pink flavour that no other recording artist could ever have. Each song has the potential to be a big hit single if released. It's also worth noting that she had a hand in composing all the songs on the album. :) <br /> <br />It's such a difficult task to pick a fave song, they are all such high quality lyrically (especially), vocally and musically. But stand outs for me would be 'Who knew' a fairly sad song about loss, 'U + Ur Hand' a rather angsty song putting a guy in his place; \\"it's just you and you're hand tonight\\" haha. Gotta love that chorus. 'Cuz I Can' was also a fave for me with it's strange retro rock sound, and also 'Leave me alone (I'm lonely)' which although is probably one of the more 'pop' sounding songs on this album, has very clever lyrics highlighting complex feelings within a relationship. :P It's risque songs such as 'Fingers' which show you she is on an entire level of (higher) talent than many other singers today. <br /> <br />A sure buy album if you love pop, rock or alternative genre, or just if you like good well-made music. :)
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|In this CD, flamenco is sung accompanied by a piano and the traditional Spanish guitar. The result is excellent.  Flamenco is not as popular as one would expect in Spain (although it is in the South of Spain), but this CD has been a hit since it was published at least 3 years ago. Moreover, I live in Washington DC and I do not know anybody who does not like it.  If you are simply curious about flamenco or if you are an expert, give this a try. You can always return it if you do not like it, and you probably have not heard anything this cool. It is like the jazz of the flamenco.    By the way. Check out some stuff from \\"Camaron\\" or \\"Falete\\" if you like it and want to discover other styles of singing flamenco.

0783225849|5.0|It is a better idea to buy this movie from Amazon than to rent it from Netflix.  I made the wrong choice.  I received a version that wouldn't play the first few times I tried, then finally played, and stopped dead 5 minutes from the end.  Gee, I wonder how it ends!<br /><br />This is a masterfully crafted murder mystery.  I am an iconoclast, and this is an icon, so I could be expected to criticize it and give it a poor rating.  No, this one deserves the best.<br /><br />It is more than just a scary shower scene.  The story is strong.  It's not simply a horror flick.  And if it is the first time you're seeing it, there are some great surprises in store.  If it is not the first time you're seeing it, you will remember it for life.

B000A88EV4|5.0|A thick and intricate plot will not be found here and if you're looking for one, you maybe sorely disappointed. However, if one is looking for rich, life-like, and carefully crafted characters than this film will satisfy and appeal to people who appreciate realistic and witty dialogue, interesting and complex relationships and very convincing performances.     The relationships that are manifested through this work of art are also carefully crafted to perfection as well; a film with a total of four main characters drives this film's run time of (128 minutes) into what feels like a nano second.                 Our beloved protagonist, Johnny, will garner the majority of the attention and rightfully so because he is so entertaining and easy to fall in love with; Johnny is raw, incredibly intelligent, witty, voluble, gregarious and highly charming. Johnny is a mere vagabond; a drifter; a true conversationist in every sense who converses with people on all different levels of society; he is a criminal on the run and yet so attractively likable.    The consequence of this criminal act moves Johnny like a magnet to it's opposite pole, or in this case, to Louis's flat in London (Johnny's ex-girlfriend)  After being invited inside by Sophie, one of Louise's roommates. It is here that we are delightfully invited into Johnny's outlook on life, time, space, technology and human nature.     The owner of the flat, Jeremy, is about as despicable and chauvinistic as a male can get. This is more plainly manifested through his treatment of women and material possessions. To Jeremy, women are less than material objects but are designed for humiliation and sexual abuse. He interchanges women faster than a politician exchanges handshakes at a campaign rally. Jeremy's brief appearances are powerful as he abuses his role as a landlord with impunity as well as dominating women with his wealth. His complete disregard for people's privacy along with his general outlook on life is appallingand highly disturbing indeed. Jeremy's character is immediately and appropriately defined when he is receiving a massage from a woman and candidly asks her, \\"do you think women like getting raped\\"?     Jeremy's distasteful traits are further enhanced when he shares the same space with Sophie. Unlike Louise, Sophie is mentally weak and submissive but strikingly attractive in her own quirky sort of way as Jeremy confesses to her.  Sophie lives very much in the present or day-to-day sort to speak. She is by far the least dominating character in the film. Her attraction to Johnny is instantaneous and his interaction with Sophie truly exposes her neediness and emotional attachment.    Louise is the alpha female of the flat. She is the only female who is able to directly challenge Jeremy's personality. Her relationship with Sophie can be best described as delicately calculated. They are not close in any emotional sense, more like an economical one, but nonetheless, they make the best of living with each other. Interestingly enough, there relationship evolves into something a little deeper when Jeremy feels it necessary to spend the night.     The relationships between these four main characters are captivating because all of their performances are convincing and seem so very real. Observing Johnny's interaction with people is entertaining and very enlightening; no one is left unscathed when sharing the same space with him, not even the mentally unstable.  The real power in this film lies in the main character, Johnny, and the director's ability to invoke sympathy and compassion for a man who has committed such a horrid criminal act of rape.     By the end of the film we forget about Johnny's mistakes, in fact, we are so interested in Johnny's past life and where the forces of nature will take him that we don't want to see him leave.  It is quite saddening actually. Initially, Johnny begins with a clear concrete destination, towards the end of the film, he becomes a free-floating leaf during a fall breeze in the streets of London once again because According to Johnny, he has an infinite amount of places to go, but it's where he stays is the problem.      On a side note, I feel it would be unfair not too mention the beautiful score to this film by Andrew Dickson, another masterpiece from start to finish. It's too bad you cannot purchase this anywhere as I have tried many times with failure.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|This is the new breed of horror film, which has become increasingly popular in the past few years. Following in the popularity of \\"Saw\\", \\"Hostel\\" is another chapter in the psychological chop-'em-up. Pretty simple story, about 3 young tourists who are lured to a youth hostel in an obscure eastern Europe town. Typical teen dangers arise ( sex, drugs, and strangers) that always result in trouble.    The movie does have moments of inspired tension, with it's ghostly town residents,a concrete killing field,and it's redemptive finale. It even tried to make the characters 3 dimensional ( could the virginal friend be [...]? What fuels our hero? and we have a promiscuous...father? ), but it seemed there wasn't enough time to care about those shadings, and instead of a paint brush.. here comes the axe... or chainsaw, or blow torch, or machete, or hammer.. at one point it's like shopping in aisle 5 at your local home depot.    Some of the scenes are disgusting, but i've seen more inspired horror scenes. I think some of the most horrific things that happen in the film, actually don't involve the aforementioned utensils, but how people care so little about a fellow human being. Is it groundbreaking... no, but is it entertaining ... yeah. It's a horror film that serves it's purpose. It didn't make me scream...but it made a good attempt.
1400032717|5.0|It's difficult to understand people who perceive the world differently than we do.  And that's what this book is about for me.  How it feels to be a person who doesn't have the same feelings or reactions or relationships that I do.  He cares deeply; he just cares differently.  I enjoyed this book very much and I frequently found myself saying, \\"Aha!  So that's how that seems or feels to him.\\"  I felt like I learned a lot and I admire the creativity that it took to tell a story from this viewpoint.  Whether that's the way that people with autism really think, who knows, but it made sense to me from the people that I have had in my life who have autism.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|Charlize Theron is Beautiful, a talented actress, and an inspired choice for the Mtv heroine Aeon Flux. The costumes were fun ( if impractical) and some of the set designs were absolutely gorgeous.It's a shame that all that's good about this movie.  <br />Aeon flux was a very edgy offensive sexually charged cartoon several years ago. This was Aeon Flux in Disneyland. A rehashed plot about a rebel group fighting a totalitarian government harboring a secret that could cripple the utopian society. Been there... done that... about a million times, and this film adds nothing new to the formula, except a few more plot holes. A city of maybe 4000 people is recycled for 400 years and no one notices, I guess they were distracted by the couture designs. It's amazing how many varied fabrics you can get in an isolated \\"last\\" city on earth.  <br />The action sequences are choppy, some of the special effects are unconvincing, and the fake twists and turns in the plot seem like afterthoughts. They should have went full tilt on Aeon. Made her edgier, more cut-throat, and more interesting. Instead we get \\"catwoman 2:into the future\\" There is a scene where some vital liquid technology is flushed down a drain...seems like the film pretty much followed.
B00008OE4W|5.0|Martin Bishop (Robert Redford)makes a living breaking into computer systems and cracking codes for the high tech world. When two government agents turn up at his firm ostensibly to hire him Bishop is put on the defensive when it turns out both are from the NSA and know that he's a fugitive. They blackmail him into accepting an assignment to find a black box that has information they want. The device can break into every computer system in the world. It turns out that things are not what they appear.<br /><br />A sharp looking transfer \\"Sneakers\\" even at 14 years of age looks great with terrific performances from everyone including the late River Phoenix. Oscar nominee David Strathairn (\\"Good Night and Good Luck\\")appears as a blind soundman that can make out more with his ears than most people can see. Poitier does a marvelous turn as a former CIA agent and Dan Aykroyd appears as their resident gadgets expert. Mary McDonnell rounds out an excellent cast with a terrific performance as Bishop's former girlfriend who gets sucked into their scheme.<br /><br />We get featurette on the making of the film where the writers/producers and writer/director Robinson discuss the history of the project, how they ended up working together on the project again. Robinson has a funny story about how they first hooked up to work together and he left without writing a word. Later he got pulled back into the project after making a number of other projects. There's an insightful commentary from writer/director Phil Alden Robinson (\\"Field of Dreams\\", \\"The Sum of All Fears\\") and the original theatrical trailer. Despite the limited features the film, this is a terrific transfer of a great thriller.

0743487583|4.0|I bought this book and I have had problems with the version. I have reason to believe that this is the original version from 1818, although many schools call for Shelley's revised 1831 version. However, the version isn't stated anywhere in the book.<br /><br />Subtle differences in the two texts include Elizabeth's relation to Victor  (she is a cousin in this novel, an orphan in the 1831 version), the chapter organization (part of this version's chapter 1 is the other's chapter 2), and various other minor occurences (in the other version, Victor and Walton discuss the seriousness of the journey and the possible loss of sailors, which doesn't occur in the 1818 book).<br /><br />If you are buying this book for school, I would advise checking version's because the subtle differences can really mess you up on tests and reading checks.
B00004XONN|5.0|...And you might fall in love with \\"Kid A\\".  Maybe.  It's a love it or hate it album.  But I can unconditionally recommend giving it at least one try, especially if you're a fan of \\"OK Computer\\" or \\"Hail to the Thief\\".    Why?  Because \\"Kid A\\" is Radiohead's true masterpiece, that's right, even more so than \\"OK Computer\\".  It takes the rulebook and rips it clean in two, managing to be so many different things in so many ways that it's almost indescribable.  Thus, this \\"review\\" will really wind up being a short guide to listening to \\"Kid A\\", then a track-by-track overview to give the reader some concept of what experiencing the album feels like.    How To Listen to \\"Kid A\\":    1) Expect the Unexpected    As many shocked listeners discovered when \\"Kid A\\" was released, it is NOT \\"OK Computer\\".  It is a Radiohead album, make no mistake, but it sounds like nothing you've ever heard before.  In a good way.  Do yourself a favor and leave any concept of what you might hear at the door.  Form your own experience of what you hear, and allow yourself to be startled by it.  It's OK, the water's warm.    2) Listen to the Entire Album    At least once.  \\"Kid A\\" flows more than any previous Radiohead work - it's supposed to be experienced as a single, cohesive whole, the only possible break being \\"Treefingers\\", which acts as an intermission of sorts.  It's shorter than \\"OK Computer\\" - you can do it, set aside 49 minutes and do the album justice.    3) Give it Time    \\"Kid A\\" is an album that absolutely refuses to give everything up on first listen.  You'll need to engage it actively if you want to enjoy it completely.  Does music always have to be work?  No, but in this case it's well worth the trouble.      Track By Track:    NOTE: This is for those who are still unsure that they will like the album, and are skittish about making the initial investment.  It's a brief overview, done mostly for my own pleasure.  Expect spoilers.    01) Everything In Its Right Place    This is actually a typical Radiohead opener in its own way: completely different from the rest of the album, it nevertheless launches you instantly into the proper context for hearing everything else.  Beginning with a single synth line that ascends upwards towards an uneasy, apprehensive standoff that somehow reminds me of \\"Thus Spake Zarathrustra\\", the listener then encounters the first \\"new\\" element on this album: Thom's vocal track has been put through a blender, then reconstituted into something that's part human, part jigsaw puzzle.  As these hacked-up bits of sound are dubbed over the normal vocals, there's an odd sense of both tension and stasis.  It's the traumatic shock in the immediate aftermath of a great tragedy, and Thom can't find the words to describe it.  As the tension and volume builds, the mangled tracks multiplying, the song suddenly resolves into the same synth line with which it began, adding some modulation/pitch bending in the right channel.  The track is both calming and disturbing, two seemingly opposing traits that will continue to mingle throughout the album.    02) Kid A    The title track opens with a sound like a UFO slowly coming to hover above the ground, only to be replaced by a nursery-rhyme melody played on what could be tubular bells.  This mix of the earthly and unearthly is what defines the song.  When deep, reverb-laden synths and muted, 808-ish bass drums kick in, the effect is something like being transported back to the womb, only to find it completely alien.  The vocals have once again been altered - this time, strained through a distorted vocoder that makes them sound like a cross between an old analog recording and some extraterrestrial along the lines of E.T.  The song is almost lulling and comforting, except for some odd squeaks that sound like dissipating air, and one single, jarringly dissonant sample in the middle, carefully calculated to throw the listener off his/her guard.  Then, just as the song sounds its most innocent andhopeful, a sample fades in of a baby crying, which in turn crossfades to a single, eerie high-pitched note.  This is counterbalanced by a guttural synth sound that leads directly into the next track:    03) The National Anthem    This is where the album begins to sound slightly more like traditional Radiohead - that is, until the brass section enters!  It begins with a simple, antagonistic bassline, gradually adding drums, odd samples, ambient noise, a high-pitched synth and a brief vocal track.  Then, out of nowhere, a low brass rhythym enters, eventually rising into squalling trumpet, and finally a chorus of different brass instruments all playing in different keys at different times.  Imagine John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and a number of other notable brass soloists blasting away at the same time on their respective instruments without any regard for what one another is playing, and you begin to get the idea.  The track is eaten alive by the brass section, only to briefly echo in a distorted orchestral arrangement that ends on a minor chord, setting the stage for the album's early climax.    04) How to Disappear Completely    Those who study Radiohead will notice a pattern emerging - The fourth track is always a slow, haunting ballad which usually winds up being one of the album's most powerful tracks.  \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" is the culmination of a number of studies in creepily beautiful ballads.  It begins with almost inaudible strings playing an unresolved minor key - almost subconsciously setting your teeth on edge.  Gradually, an arrhythmic acoustic guitar fades in, meandering down minor progressions which heighten the uneasy mood.  Thom enters quietly, in the lower part of his falsetto range, as heart-stopping downward glissandos provoke palpitations.  \\"I'm not here/This isn't happening\\" he sings quietly.  From there, the track slowly crescendos, by turns achingly beautiful, heart-rending and nerve-wracking.  It's equal parts crisis andcatharsis, revelling and worrying over one terrible moment.  If \\"Kid A\\" is, as Yorke puts it, \\"something traumatic\\", then this is the definitive moment of trauma.  All those who accuse \\"Kid A\\" of being inhuman, listen carefully.  Radiohead have never been more fully committed, spiritually and emotionally, than in this song.    05) Treefingers    After the intense ordeal of the last two songs, the listener is confronted with long, rounded, synth-like sounds (actually played on guitar, then cut-and-pasted in post-production).  It reminds me of sunlight glinting through the branches of underwater trees (kelp or coral, I don't know).  Yet even this ambient work, so soothing, is slightly troubling as well.  In the end, \\"Treefingers\\" serves as a full-stop, a brief intermission between first and second acts, a chance for the listener to catch his/her breath.    06) Optimistic    This track is a somewhat startling jolt after the ambient nature of the last one.  The listener is immediately launched into the most satisfyingly \\"normal\\" song on the album - if anything sounds like \\"OK Computer\\" on \\"Kid A\\", this is it: specifically, it's the best parts of \\"Electioneering\\", rearranged to form an even more biting and sarcastic song.  \\"Try the best you can/Try the best you can/The best you can is good enough\\" Thom taunts sardonically after commenting on how \\"the big fish eat the little ones\\".  It's the bitter medicine to the \\"everyone is special\\" method of child rearing that has infected the world today.  The track is mostly powered by the five-piece guitar-driven dynamic that made Radiohead famous, although towards the ending it dissolves towards an interesting jam with jazz-rock tendencies.  It ends with a crash cymbal, segueing directly into the next track.    07) In Limbo    After a brief, stuttering synth intro, tumbling drums and unsettling guitar arpeggios set up a chaotic composition.  The vocals, wailed over these tides of instrumentation, only increase the feeling of unease.  This was one of the most disturbing songs on the album for me.  Between the creepy intonation \\"You're living in a fantasy world\\" (reminiscent of the \\"Dream on\\" line from the film \\"Jacob's Ladder\\") and the howls of \\"GO AWAY\\" that are distorted into meaninglessness at the song's end, it's pretty frightening.    08) Idioteque    Combine a moody ambient synth with stuttering, Aphex Twin beats and challenging vocals, and you have the ultimate feel-bad, anti-Dance electronic track.  Given all that, \\"Idioteque\\" is still pretty entertaining (and surprisingly singable/danceable during some bits) in its own morbid, apocalyptic way.  One could spend ages simply dissecting the intricacies of the squeaks and scratches that form the song's beat.  The lyrics are mostly oblique, although some say that they deal with the threat of global warming.  The only thing that's really clear is that this song is the foretelling of the inevitable apocalypse that gives the album its name (\\"Kid A\\" is the term for the first child born after an apocalyptic event).  The track ends on a prolonged dissonant chord, which dissolves into the next song.    09) Morning Bell    If you oversimplified \\"Kid A\\" down to just a concept album (with the title track representing birth, \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" representing teenage years, \\"Optimistic\\" being the greedy beginnings of adulthood and \\"Idioteque\\" being the concerned years of middle age), then this song would most likely deal with the central character's old age or senility.  That's not to say that it sounds aged or senile - it just seems to express the ramblings of a senile mind.  Between the disjointed, nonsensical lyrics (mumbled by Yorke in a nervous falsetto whisper) the shredded guitar peals in the background and the splintered drums, there's a general impression of disorder, briefly shattered by a sudden crescendo halfway through the song where suddenly all the disparate elements of the song seem united in a single purpose, only to evaporate back towards minimalist unrest, finally fading to just a synth chord and a groping, muted bassline.    10) Motion Picture Soundtrack    \\"Kid A\\"'s grand finale starts with just an old organ, pumping away at chords that sound older and wiser than time.  The vocals come slowly, patiently, heart-breaking in their steady intensity.  \\"I think you're crazy,\\" Thom sings in a manner that sounds like anything but disapproval.  There's a brief measure of rest, then unearthly sounds, like a child's toy or an alien spaceship, trickle upwards and downwards over the vocal track, eventually supplemented by an equally ethereal, operatic voice, rising upwards into oblivion (To some, it may be slightly reminiscent of the soundtrack at the very end of \\"The Elephant Man\\").  It drives me to tears almost every time I listen to it, the unlikely duet straining upwards towards the heavens as Thom sings \\"I will see you in the next life.\\"  The tinkling, jack-in-the-box-like instrument then slides from the top to the bottom of its range, before spiraling off in random tangents, slowling fading into silence.    This silence lasts for roughly a minute before it slowly fades into feedback, replaced by the sound of strings tuning and the lifts of an enormous choir, collapsing into cheerful electronic beeps.  Perhaps this is the \\"next life\\" of which Yorke sings.  If so, we only glimpse it for thirty seconds before there are two more minutes of silence, and the album repeats.

B000EDWL82|5.0|This is an excellent CD. Yeah, we all know there are at least a dozen bands out there being compared to early Joy Division, but Bernard and Peter were never this good. There is some guitar work on this CD that is reminescent of some early work by the boys from the Church. No not Starfish, but rather \\"The Blurred Crusade\\" or \\"Of Skins and Hearts\\" \\"Heydey\\" or \\"Seance.\\" Also, there are some excellent guitar synth type lines on this CD that scream My Bloody Valentine. Kevin Shields, eat your heart out. Where did you go man? Maybe even some Slowdive if you will. Regardless of these comparisons, this band has put out a quality CD that is fresh, ambient, sonically sound and I will keep my eye out for these guys as I forsee more quality stuff headed our way!!!

HOWEVER, THEY ARE OVERHYPED AND THEY KNOW IT. THATS WHAT I ACTUALLY LIKE ABOUT THEM. THEY ARE MODEST OR SEEM MODEST AS PEOPLE. OVERSEAS A LOT OF BANDS ARE MAJORLY HYPED AND DISAPPEAR. JUST WORDS OF WISDOM FOR ALL YOU KIDS OUT THERE THAT LIKE THEM. JUST THINK ROBBIE WILLIAMS AMONG OTHERS THAT WERE HAILED AS THE NEXT BIG THING AND THEY ARE A JOKE OR HAVE BECOME A JOKE. BUT WHOS TO SAY WHAT WILL HAPPEN. MAYBE THEY WILL HAVE A LONG CAREER AHEAD OR JUST DISAPPEAR SLOWLY. <br />PEACE

Each song has its own unique flavor and all I can say is: GO BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!
B000EHQ8AU|5.0|I am really not a big fan of Nancy boy, not at all. <br />I am more into Ask for answers, black market blood, twenty years, without you Im nothing, days before you came, passive aggressive, Haemoglobin and a lot others(...) <br /> <br />Considering those songs, this album is totally new! <br />First Time I listened to ~In the Cold Light Of Morning~, I said WTH! now, I have intimate moments with this song! ~In the Cold Light Of Morning~ is the most song played lately on my media player! I liked ~Blind~ (the most) from the first time, and it is still the best.  <br />~One of a Kind~ comes next, followed direclty by ~Because I want you~ and ~Meds~ (as in rating). I liked ~Post Blue~ a lot at first, but then I seemed getting bored from it.. <br />I will leave ~Follow the cops back home~ for later, I really liked it from the beginning, and still do, but dunno why not playing it much.. <br />I liked ~Infrared~ a lot from the sample they posted on their website, but then when I listened to the whole song, I felt like it could been better. The lyrics are really \\"new\\" and \\"cute\\"? but hey I bet it could been better, the start of the song is awesome. Same thing for ~space monkey~, the song starts perfect, but it gets way tooo slow. <br />~Song to say Goodbye~ is great, but dunno in what rating position it falls. <br />

B00005JO20|1.0|Yeah, you'll give me a \\"this review was not helpful\\" rating, but I don't care. This bombastic, over-indulgent piece of mis-directed, poorly written drivel is one of the best examples of how super-ego and super-budget does not equal great movie.<br /><br />Let's start with the visuals. The visual effects are absolutely appalling. I've seen art students with mac minis and copies of maya do a better job. I am speechless at all the people who talk about the visual splendour of this film. It's amateurish and makes me think of 80s Harry Hanussen movies. The blue screen stuff is pitiful.<br /><br />Next comes the lame script. Here we go with formula guys: Act 1 (1 hour) getting to the island. Cliched set-ups of  cliched characters. Act 2 (1 hour) on the island. Endless chase scenes with animals and scene after scene of impossible physics. That Ann isn't killed a hundred times over is impossible. But hey, it's a movie. Act 3 (1 hour) getting back to New York. This is the only part of the film I liked, but even that was choppy.<br /><br />The acting is okay. I actually think Jack Black brought something to his role. Naomi Watts and Brody walk through their scenes. There's no depth here, folks. Doesn't anyone remember how great Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange were in the 70's version?<br /><br />Finally, the direction. Peter Jackson does not understand tone. This is why all his movies before Lord of the Rings (where the tone was dictated by the content, which was an adaptation) did not work. Have you seen them? Frighteners, Heavenly Creatures, Meet the Feebles - all interesting movies but the tone is off. Same here. Is this a comedy, a drama, an action film? The cliches make me think he's going for B-movie matinee stuff, the dramatic scenes make me think he wanted epic, the gross animals stuff makes me think horror. Can't a movie be all? Yep, but when you look at something like Jurassic Park, you see that they can work together seemlessly. Not here.<br /><br />In the end it's poorly executed potboiler mash and it's disconcerting that so many critics and viewers have lapped this up. If we don't start expecting more, this will be the benchmark and filmmakers just wont have to try any harder.e end it's poorly executed potboiler mash and it's disconcerting that so many critics and viewers have lapped this up.

0671027387|4.0|\\"Deception Point\\" is the third Dan Brown book I've read and I'm starting to wonder if this author makes a point of always having some character killed in the first couple of pages of his books. More interestingly, he also seems to make a point of writing damn good thrillers. In my opinion, \\"Da Vinci Code\\" was alright, \\"Angels & Demons\\" was rather good and now I find \\"Deception Point\\" hanging somewhere in between.<br /><br />The action unfolds for the most part between the Arctic and Washington DC. Long story short, NASA claims to have found a meteorite, packed with fossils of what appears to be an extraterrestrial being, which fell on the earth and got buried in the Milne Ice Shelf. The truth however is usually stranger than fiction and so we follow three civilians, two of them reputed scientists, trying to put the seemingly disjointed pieces of this puzzle together while doing their best to avoid getting wacked by ruthless (but in all honesty not very smart) killers. But you can learn all this from reading the book synopsis, right?<br /><br />I found this to be a satisfying book, an undeniable page turner and exceptionally well written featuring a couple of rather intelligent plot twists. As I said before, the action unravels between the Arctic (and later on the Atlantic shore) and Washington DC. Whereas at the former reside the thrills and crazy Hollywood type fireworks, it's in the latter that the really interesting stuff, at least for me, is happening.<br /><br />Brown swaps back and forth between the two intertwined plot lines but I found myself constantly eager for the political games going on in DC and involving top ranking US government agencies all the way up to the White House. Unfortunately, the final showdown aboard a ship is described at such exhaustive length that I couldn't help but feeling bummed every time a new chapter on it presented itself. Also, some more character development, at least for the main parts, wouldn't hurt. I personally would've liked to know more about them, as they seemed interesting but not dense enough. Nevertheless, this should not taint some great classic moments this story contains.<br /><br />Finally, after reading three books by Dan Brown, he reminds me a bit of the TV show \\"24\\". Both found a great formula that thrills the viewer/reader but whereas \\"24\\" keeps successfully reinventing itself every season, Brown's way is becoming a bit tiresome for me. Like, I'll read \\"Digital Fortress\\", sure. Just not now.d've liked to know more about them, as they seemed interesting but not dense enough.

0743454537|4.0|After reading rave reviews on Picoult's 'My Sister's Keeper', I decided to pick up a copy. <br /> <br />Beginning the book, I got right into it. I enjoyed the fact that the chapters were sorted by day, and by narrator. This type of narrative made this book enjoyable to read. <br /> <br />The book itself had an interesting concept. Girl, after 13 years, wanting medical emancipation for her own body. The twists were slight, but major, and very interesting. Anna's reasons for wanting this emancipation is an intriguing surprise. <br /> <br />It deals with many complicated issues, and most are mentioned during the court case. Picoult has done her research in regards to the law, and cancer types. The story is mainly about Anna and her sister, Kate, but Picoult adds multiple minor storylines, involving other characters, which ensures the book is not a continual, tedious bore. <br /> <br />The ending was intense, unexpected, but also very predictable in a way. It was an easy way out to say that Jesse had changed \\"just like that\\", and that now he is a \\"good kid\\". It was typical that Campbell and Julia hooked up. It seemed that all characters has reversed from what they were at the beginning of the novel. Everything solved itself. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if it was intentional, but during the book I thoroughly disliked the girls' mother, Sara. I think her actions and intentions needed to be explained slightly better. Also, I'm sure if what happened to Anna at the end happened to my child, I wouldn't be too happy with Campbell for a short period. The parents showed no annoyance with him. I also found that Picoult left some questions unanswered, and felt that some aspects of the novel were slightly unrealistic. <br /> <br />All in all, a great read, in which I couldn't put down. It wasn't fantastic, but it was pretty good. Although I felt this novel was slightly overrated, I must say that I do look forward to reading more Picoult novels in the future.
B000005HLV|5.0|OK, so it looks like people are severely divided over this album.     Some see it as a pile of mediocre [...] that has been outshone by many others before and since. These people usually come from a traditional Metal background and base their assessment -- as traditional Metal usually does -- on the technical merits of the album. (\\"Euronymous wasn't the best guitarist in the world\\", \\"Attila's vocals suck\\", etc., etc.)  Or they may be into bands with more of a keyboard-oriented sound like Dimmu Borgir or Emperor.    Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum others who are more specifically into the guitar-based side of the Black Metal genre revere this album as a kind of unholy grail of Black Metal. These people usually look at the album more as a whole, and are able to appreciate it for its overall atmosphere rather than nit-picking apart its merits of musical virtuousity.    As for me, I belong to the ones who consider it one of the best Metal albums of all time. I grew up hating traditional mainstream Metal (except for Sabbath), so it came as kind of a shock to me when I heard this thing called \\"Black Metal\\" and discovered I loved it. No boring-as-hell squealy 20-minute Jimmy Page guitar solos here. The aesthetic here was much closer to the Punk that I grew up loving, but with a much, much heavier, harder Metal edge, and a heart of blackest darkness.    It is this darkness that I feel best defines this album, and it comes out in the overall sound of the band. If Darkthrone's sound can be described as a kind of drone, I would call Mayhem's sound more of a throb, kind of like the throb of a powerful engine. This guitar throb forms the basis of the music, with the solos naturally flowing in and out.    And what really sets this band apart from the pack for me is Hellhammer's brilliant drumming, so inventive and unlike the boring style popular with many bands these days that is so fast and repetetive that it sounds almost machine-generated (--Dark Funeral anyone?).He truly deserves the title of best drummer in all of Black Metal. Add to this Varg's bass which nimbly climbs in and out around the guitar and drums (check out \\"Freezing Moon\\" for a good example of this).    And over top of all of this is Attila Csihar's vocals. Now, I realize they're not for everyone and even I didn't appreciate them at first. But after listening a few times I found that on the initial track \\"Funeral Fog\\" his voice reminded me of a hissing, slimy little Peter Lorre/Gollum type of character. After that he breaks into more of a scream on the other songs, and with his Hungarian accent Attila's voice almost sounds like a freaked-out Bela Lugosi risen from the grave to haunt us with an evil message from beyond. -- Perfect for Black Metal!    This is one of the very few albums I own that I can listen to over and over and never get sick of. The songs just have this tremendous energy and power to them that create a flow through the entire album. That, for me, is the sign of a truly great album.    So this album is not for everyone. If you're a Metal traditionalist or if you like keyboards in your Black Metal, you probably won't be too impressed. But if you're into heavy, atmospheric, guitar-driven Black Metal and have the imagination necessary to cope with Attila's unconventional vocal style, you just might be able to understand why so many of us rate this album so highly.
0930289528|5.0|Wow. Can this really be twenty years old? In many ways, it's a story that could have come from the current day. A brutal, totalitarian regime has installed itself in the UK. They have installed Orwellian surveillance of the population, an apparat for monitoring the cameras and microphones, and a secret police with powers of summary justice, to enforce their iron rule. First, they purge the music, books, and culture of the old ways. They, they round up the homosexuals, \\"darkies,\\" and other threats to the white sameness of their populace. Some are deported; others are turned over to death camps and to sadistic medical \\"experiments.\\" The human test animals were transformed in bizarre ways, and died in droves.<br /><br />All but one, test subject five. He was transformed, too, in ways that the prison keepers never detected. At least, not until he blew it up around them and burned the ruins. Then, he vanished. So, over the next few years, did those who staffed the prison - dead one after another. Number five, roman numeral V, had been transformed into vengeance, against his torturers and against the government that institutionalized that torture.<br /><br />The story is what makes this comic. The artwork does a workmanlike job of carrying the story and the characters within it - for better and (more often) for worse. The recent movie changed this story in many particulars, but kept the story largely intact. Despite the differences, or because of them, both versions work well.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00000612Q|5.0|How do you make a solo album? Call your band mates. How do you follow up a serious classic album? Make a fun classic album! Step 1: call the Faces, Step 2: Add some awesome studio musicians, Step 3: Rock'n'Roll. One of the most underrated,unabated albums ever recorded, it never disappoints from song 1 to song end. True Blue kicks off the album in a raw and rythmic jam followed by one of the greatest exiles of FM radio the loose rockin' \\"Lost Paraguayos\\" where all guitars,vocals,horns,bass & sloppy drums SHINE! Next The Faces make Dylan their own with \\"Mama You Been on My Mind\\" and then roar through the infectious riff rock of Italian Girls\\". A simplified soulful garage rock version of Hendrix's \\"Angel\\" keeps the good times rolling. The classic \\" You Wear it Well\\" starts the second half of the album which concludes with 2 smokin' remakes:  Etta James would be proud of the boy's take on her classic \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" and next is a get up and party version of Sam Cooke's \\"Twistin' the Night Away\\". WARNING this album makes you want to play it over and over again!!!
B000301YY8|5.0|I have read both bad and good reviews of James Blunts new album.  <br />I am all in favor of the latter. I think that it is an awesome first recording. I bought his cd after his original appearance on Saturday Night Live back in November(?). I was so moved by his performance of Beautiful, I had to hear more.  <br />Now, he is being played on the radio. That is cool. However, I think that people who are only into mainstream pop music will not enjoy his album in its entirity. I feel that the general public is often too closed minded to appreciate the authenticity, originality, and overall ability of new artists such as James Blunt.  <br /> <br />As I listen to his CD again, I am reminded of the debut albums of Joan Osborne, and Jewel. Yes, I know that these are women! However, both of those first albums had the obvious radio play tracks. The rest of the songs reached further than mainstream. <br /> <br />I hope that you enjoy and appreciate James Blunts music as much as I do. Peace out!
B000002J1U|2.0|Only \\"In Through the Out Door\\" is a weaker Zep album. From the the 3 opening toss-offs \\"Immigrant Song\\",\\"Friends\\",and the much better 'live' \\"Celebration Day\\" one begins to wonder if guitar \\"hero\\" Jimmy Page already ran out of riffs. Then as the watered down blues of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" confirms Page's lack of creative spark we get what seems to be another Zep outtake \\"Out on the Tiles\\" to verify Zep's innovative drought. The album starts to show some signs of life by going to a 'back to the basics' acoustic set of songs starting with the middling \\"Gallows Pole\\" followed by the album highlights: the beautiful back-country ballads \\"Tangerine\\",  \\"That's the Way\\" & the haunting \\"Bron y Aur Stomp\\". Unfortunately the album ends on the \\"Zeppelin can play anything and the public will like it\\" unmelodic noise-fest filler \\"(Hats off to)Roy Harper\\" If you want some back to the basics blues-country-rock you'll be much happier with the Rolling Stones \\"Beggars Banquet\\" released 2 years prior.
0385504209|4.0|Whether you believe all the details or not, this book is definitely worth the read! The \\"facts\\" are very intriguing, and I found myself grabbing my Bible, and doing google searches in order to take a closer look at many of DaVinci's works of art. For that aspect alone, it's worth the read....great mind-stimulation!<br /><br />The build-up throughout the book and the character development are excellent, but I must admit that I was disappointed in the ending (the only reason I give this book a 4 out of 5). I guess I was expecting something more spectacular based on what I'd read up until that point. To the author's credit, the book does leave much room for personal interpretation. All of that said, I would highly recommend this book to others.

8440619537|5.0|Mary Shelly is brilliant.  This story is far beyond it's time and movies does not justify the contents of this book.  Both Frankenstein and Dr. Frankenstein are unique characters both at the extreme ends.  This book touches upon almost every aspect of human nature.  I love the infancy stages of Frankenstein and his developed character.  Dr. Frankenstein was corrupted with power and ultimately paid for is greed.  I can go on writing about other aspects that makes this book so incredible, but the one aspect that truly effects us today is in the area of creating life. With advanced technology we are able create, and clone whatever we would like.  The question is, if the creation is by our own hands should it exist?
B00005BJ9W|4.0|If you're reading this you probably have already heard this music and have your own opinion about it.  ...  The point of this review is that music on the CD is not entirely the same as that on the US LP.<br /><br />Compare the timings:<br /><br />The US LP version of Rio:<br /><br />A1 - Rio (5:28)<br />A2 - My Own Way (4:36)<br />A3 - Lonely In Your Nightmare (4:52)<br />A4 - Hungry Like The Wolf (5:14)<br />A5 - Hold Back The Rain (6:32)<br />B1 - New Religion (5:31)<br />B2 - Last Chance On The Stairway (4:18)<br />B3 - Save A Prayer (5:33)<br />B4 - The Chauffeur (5:12)<br /><br />The CD being offered here (i.e., the UK/International version of the LP):<br /><br />1 - Rio (5:38)<br />2 - My Own Way (4:51)<br />3 - Lonely In Your Nightmare (3:50)<br />4 - Hungry Like The Wolf (3:41)<br />5 - Hold Back The Rain (3:49)<br />6 - New Religion (5:33)<br />7 - Last Chance On The Stairway (4:20)<br />8 - Save A Prayer (5:25)<br />9 - The Chauffeur (5:12)<br /><br />As the timings above show, some of the songs on the US LP are significantly different from those on this CD, which is a remastering of the UK/international LP version of Rio.  So, this CD isn't the same as the record you may have listened to back then.  I noticed this right away when listening to it.<br /><br />This CD is less than 45 minutes long.  Given that 80 minutes can fit onto a CD, Capitol could easily have made this release much better by including (as \\"bonus\\" tracks) the US LP versions of the songs as well, and then you could just program on your CD player the version that you wanted to hear.<br /><br />UPDATE: Apparently in late 2009 a double CD version of Rio was released, it appears to offer most of the mixes that were on the US LP.

B0007PAMR4|2.0|My negative comments are on THIS version of the movie, not the story itself or the origional 2hr release of the movie. As with all negative comments left, I'm sure I'll get some negative feedback on this review. . .but here goes nothin:<br /><br />So. . .as a BIG fan of of the original trilogy and Lynch's version of the movie I had to watch the recent release of the Extended version of Dune.<br /><br />I heard the original movie had six hours that was cut down to the original release of just over two hours. So when the three hour version came out I anticipated great things. . . but was let down.<br /><br />For someone who has never read the book the first thirty minutes adds additional narriation and character introduction to get one understanding who the players of the story are. Fine. But, for those of us familiar with the story, the extra drawings and narrations aren't of any additional benefit and thus most of the extra 40 minutes of footage is wasted on this portion of the movie.<br /><br />Some scenes the narriation broke the pace of the scene letting the scene seem dull and flat. For example, when we are first introduced to Paul while his three mentors walk into the room the narriation breaks the scene to introduce each of the three mentors. A great ploy to get any newbie acquaintd to the story of Dune but the pace of the scene was dramatically interrupted to do so. Just didn't work for me.<br /><br />Other scenes that were included in the original release are changed. Dialogue either cut or edited differently, thus if the viewer if familiar with the orginal release the scene leaves the viewer with a sense of wrongness.<br /><br />For example, the Baron never spits in Lady Jessica's face, the scene is highly altered in this version leaving it seemingly dull and sensless for what little there was of it.<br /><br />Another example, we aren't prepared for Chani's introduction via Paul's visions as in the previous release. So when he meets her in real life and says &#34;Oh, the woman of my dreams,&#34; we don't get the connection because one hasn't been strongly established, thus their growing love is not believable in this version.<br /><br />So down with the complaining, what did I like about this version?<br /><br />There were some fun extra scenes though. For example Gurney as a troubador quotes some poetry as he is assigned a task by the Duke. When he leaves everyone is laughing at Gurney's dramatics. This was a nice touch into the character of Gurney. Also we get to see them milking the young worm for the Water of Life. Another cool scene.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Even with the few apprecaited extra scenes overall I think this version is far inferior to the 2+ hour version. Read the book, watch the original release and enjoy, but only die hard fans need even bother with a rental if they must see something different.ys &#34;Oh, the woman of my dreams,&#34; we don't get the connection because one hasn't been strongly established, thus their growing love is not believable in this version.<br /><br />So down with the complaining, what did I like about this version?<br /><br />There were some fun extra scenes though.

0393327655|1.0|\\"Attention has rightly been drawn to the clash of civilizations...The danger is made more acute by organized terrorism, which has already spread over the whole planet.  Its causes are many and complex, not least those to do with political ideology, combined with aberrant religious ideas.   Terrorism does not hesitate to strike defenseless people, without discrimination, or to impose inhuman blackmail , causing panic among entire populations, in order to force political leaders to support the designs of terrorists.  No situation can justify such criminal activity, which covers the perpetrators with infamy, and it is all the more deplorable when it hides behind religion, thereby bringing the pure truth of God down to the level of the terrorists' own blindness and moral perversion.\\" <br /> <br />\\"10:00:22 - Oh Allah, Oh Allah, Oh Gracious <br /> <br />10:00:25 - [Passenger, struggling to enter cockpit.) In the cockpit.  If we don't, we'll die <br /> <br />10:01:08  - [Hijacker in arabic] Is that it? I mean, shall we pull it down? <br /> <br />10:01:09 - Yes, put it in it, and pull it down. <br /> <br />10:03:02 - Allah is the greatest. <br /> <br />In his book \\"The End of Faith\\", curiously subtitled Religion,Terror and The Future of Reason, Sam Harris seeks to draw one ineluctable conclusion:  That our civilization is stuck in the religious thinking of 1400 while all other human endeavors have advanced apace and that ultimately, we will be destroyed unless we abandon faith.  The first passage quoted above is from Pope Benedict XVI's January 2006 address to the diplomatic corps attached to the Holy See.  The second captures the thinking of the Flight 93 hijackers of 2001.  On balance, I believe the Holy Father is correct in his assessment of the perversion of religious ideals.   <br /> <br />Nonetheless, Harris wastes hundreds of pages as he thrashes about to prove that religion is nonsense and that we should drop our faith-based rituals so we can .. what?  The book isimmensely tiresome as Harris veers from grudging acceptance of the positive effects of religion and the incredible claims and conflicting maxims of religious texts.  It is curious to note that Harris refers to the generic God as \\"the creator of the universe\\" -- a most tiresome phrase - because his own Jewish faith prohibits him from using the word God.  Examining the dust cover, we see that Harris is a \\"graduate in philosophy\\" and has observed things for twenty years.  He is currently working on a neuroscience PhD and if the quality of his book is any indication of his scholarship, perhaps he should get an EdD or an online degree.  Among the many transgressions committed here are stating his beliefs as fact, footnotes that border on the absurd [In one note, he supports the fact that paranormal phenomenon exist by quoting an author.  In a subsequent footnote, he writes \\"This man is not a crank!].  The most egregious sin occurs in the chapter dealing with Islam where he \\"string cites\\" dozens of Koranic verses then adds a footnote quoting a British Colonial figure who expresses his exasperation with reading the Koran becasue it is dull. <br /> <br />Had we not the pleasure of others who point out sublimely, boldly or otherwise the paradox of religious faith such as Kurt Vonnegut, Ayn Rand, Johnny Lydon etc, we could perhaps look afresh at this tome.  But Harris's faux scientific arguments and fallacious logic make me yawn. <br /> <br />Despite Harris's twenty years of observation, he mischaractarizes modern religious toleration.  For example, <br />I quoted Pope Benedict's statement above because it nicely encapsulates modern thinking on the perversion (rather than the practice) of religion.  Having learned from the past barbarities, Western religious thought seeks a higher truth and the days of enforced dogma and blind obedience are over in the Western world.  However, Harris pounds the table cloyingly and annoyingly that we must forsake religious tolerance and all must renounce faith (however, we can recognize the paranormal and navigate through the use of echos if we must have balderdash in our lives.)  This thinking is an atheistic version of fascism.  Rather than recognize the excesses of our enemy we must all strip ourselves of faith and then our enemies will live in a reason based world.  Been there, done that with the French Revoloution, my friend.  Besides it will never happen again -- not as long as we have American Idol. <br /> <br />In conclusion, Harris's arguments that religious faith is the cause of all evil must prod one to ask, what religious faith caused the following episodes: <br /> <br />1)  Pol Pot's reign of terror in 1975 <br />2)  Joe Stalin <br />3)  The Great Leap Forward in China <br />4)  Castro <br /> <br />It seems that religion has been perverted since the beginning of time by psychotic individuals who have harnessed the power of belief to wield the masses towards their ends.  But does it logically follow that the billions who have irrational beliefs should not be tolerated because of the past?  Isn't this like blaming the U.S. for 9/11?   <br /> <br />Harris's book is a waste of time for anyone with a brain, a moral compass or anything better to do.

B000E6ESL2|1.0|I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer that compared this movie to an episode of the original Twilight Zone (lamentably on every level other than length). However I take great exception to an earlier comparison to The Sixth Sense and Memento, both of which are among my favourite movies of all time.  I can only assume that reviewer disliked all three.  Stay is a classic \\"Sixth Sense wannabe\\" which falls disastrously short of the phenomenon status of the latter.  I think most reviewers are just scared to admit that the movie made no sense, in case they are labelled philistines by the artsy-fartsy types to whom this film surely exclusively appeals, or for fear that the movie actually made sense to someone of a superior intellect.  The Sixth Sense and Memento ended with a startling revelation that offered a dramatic explanation of the events in the rest of the movie, and yet one that was consistent with those events.  There is nothing remotely interesting, shocking or entertaining in the ending of this movie.  Stay was no different to a movie that ends with someone waking up and realising it was all a dream (an explanation of sorts, but not one that adds anything to the movie or to your life), in fact probably worse as it left certain over-played plot elements yet hopelessly unresolved (the persistent references to Lela's own suicide, the inter-changability of Sam/Henry, Sam's interactions with the parallel characters of Henry's parents - were these all nothing but pointless misdirection??).   To me visuals are primarily employed to carry a story and are not merely to be enjoyed on their own merit.  If I wanted visuals in the absence of plot, I would have gone to a museum.  The point of the first hour and a half of this movie is just to confuse the hell out of you and inspire hope that the ending will offer some kind of meaningful explanation.  The former achieved admirably and latter sadly not in the least.  It did provoke emotion in me - outright rage that I had just wasted an hour and three quarters of my precious leisure time on such utter nonsense.  Please for the love of God, if you are reading this with a mind to your own review, be honest - don't submit to the temptation to delude yourself that you enjoyed this film on some level just because it was \\"stylish\\" and included some big-name actors.  A good rating on a movie like this is a license for anyone with Hollywood ambition to write another screenplay full of surreal events that make no sense as long as it ends with an \\"explanation\\" that one or more of the characters was really just having a brain malfunction (SUUUURPRIIIIIISE!!).
0743267060|4.0|This perceptive and well-executed film still after nearly 15 years since its release comes over as one of the most original films I've ever watched. The storyline is nothing more than a re-working of a classic fairy tale of handsome princes and ugly frogs (or dance partners) and yet the magical retelling make this film the success it is. <br /> <br />Scott Hastings is the ballroom dance prodigy who since being groomed to win the all important Pan-Pacific Grand Prix championship from the age of 6 looks like he could be throwing it all away by continuing to use un-registered and therefore illegal dance steps in his routine. His mother is shocked and dismayed that Scott could throw his chance of the title, his dance coach, Les Kendell is similarly gob smacked but most effected of all is Scott dance partner, who quits dancing with Scott and takes up with arch rival, the peroxide blonde Ken Railings.  <br /> <br />Scott on the other hand is less concerned and seems more bothered with trying to dance true to the tune in his heart, a feeling that is shared by plain beginner dancer Fran. Scott and Fran begin to practice in secret, Scott deciding that his mother and Les wouldn't approve of such an unattractive and unorthodox partner and Fran deciding that her authoritarian and unforgiving Latino father would definitely not approve of her associating with such a boy. The backdrop the whole film is the outrageous and colourful world of Australian Ballroom Dance championships. There's more sequins and fake tan going on here than ever seen in one place before. Overseeing it all is chairman of the dance association, the toupeed and orange Barry Fife.  <br /> <br />As I say, it doesn't take the brains of an Archbishop to work out what is going to happen here but the enthusiasm and energy that the pretty unknown cast bring to the film makes it almost compulsive viewing. Both Paul Mercurio (Scott) and Tara Morice (Fran) bring a charming innocence to their roles and it's really niceto see a proper ugly duckling to beautiful swan story. There's great support from the rest of the cast but both Pat Thomson and Bill Hunter deserve special mentions.
B002WYH5N2|3.0|There's two ways you're going to approach this movie. Your options are:<br /><br />1. I want to watch a fun romantic movie that happens to take place in 1800 England.<br /><br />2. I want to watch a faithful production of a Jane Austen book.<br /><br />If you approached the movie from the first criteria you probably enjoyed it. If you approached it from the second criteria, you probably didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />I have no arguments against the movie as a romantic comedy. It's fun to watch, there's enough sparks to keep you interested and it ends well. What more do you need?<br /><br />But if you're looking for a faithful adaptation of not only Austen's book but an accurate portrayal of the lives of the landed gentry of the time, you probably found yourself annoyed, even angry and disgusted.<br /><br />I've read through several pages of reviews on this movie and there seems to be two common themes regarding the accuracy of the movie's setting.<br /><br />1. Some people thought it was more realistic than the 1995 product but I beg to differ. The Bennets were not farmers. They were not gentlemen farmers. They were landed gentry. The landed gentry lived on estates that comprised of tenanted farms rented out and the family lived off the income. They did not directly engage in farming. The concept that there would be livestock, including pigs, wandering through the manor house is ridiculous, if only because regular farmers certainly didn't let livestock run through their houses either! In the book Mr. Bennet spent his time shooting, reading and drinking wine. Mrs. Bennet boasted about the servants they had and that the girls never needed to cook or clean. They were the idle rich, if not as rich as Darcy or the Bingleys. The Bennets had an income of 2,000 pounds a year at a time when the typical laborer's income was 25 pounds a year. Think about that very carefully before deciding that the relatively impoverished portrayal of the family in this film was historically accurate.<br /><br />2. People liked this movie better because there was more emotion involved between the main characters. I can see where this is coming from. Certainly compared to the 1995 production Darcy and Elizabeth are more physically emotional and one sees more &#34;sparks&#34;. That's fine. It's fun to watch. Then again it's not necessarily historically accurate either. Judging the behavior and attitude of characters from 1800 by 2005 standards is wholly misleading. The British upper classes to which the Bennets and the Darcys belonged prided themselves on a very strict set of rules governing public behavior and social conduct, after all they gave birth to the entire concept of the &#34;stiff upper lips.&#34; Elizabeth Bennet would not have shouted at Darcy as she did in this movie, to do so would be a sign of bad breeding and bad behavior, which she went great pains to avoid because other members of her family were already badly behaved. Jane Austen makes clear that characters who were too publicly emotional and who couldn't constrain themselves with proper decorum were looked down upon or suffered badly - such as Mrs. Bennet who is held in contempt or Lydia who's a ridiculous character deserving little sympathy and whose behavior almost ruined her sisters' chances for a good marriage. It may be difficult for a modern audience to struggle with this concept but the rules governing behavior in 1800 England was very different from today and very strict by modern day standards. If a real family like the Bennets as portrayed in this film were around in 1800 England, they'd have been shunned and despised by their neighborhoods much as we might look down on &#34;trashy&#34; people for loud, vulgar and coarse behavior, lack of neatness of dress or unshaven faces.<br /><br />On the whole it was a fun and entertaining movie to watch if you didn't take it too seriously. It's still too &#34;2005&#34; as too many modern influences from behavior to hair styles and even clothes crept into the film to make it realistically accurate. The 1995 production is so accurate that it's become timeless - you really can't tell if it was made in 1975 or 1985 or 2005 or today.
0679720200|4.0|I think that this book reveals to us the utter conditioning of society. We are all expected to act and think and feel in certain ways in certain conditions. Most of our actions have to fall in the narrow field of acceptability and if they don't then we are looked at with supsicion and mistrust. Just consider if you should stop and stare at something in the street particularly beautiful for more than a moment. Those walking by would regard you as a little odd and possibly dangerous. Not just acts either, our values, our beliefs, our desires. Who is this man that doesn't feel as he should we ask of Meursault. <br /> <br />Meursault is a man who rejects the conditioning of society and dies for it. He doesn't feel, but does he have to? He is his own man. Is not a man ultimately accountable only to himself? Meursault knows this and tells us in the last part of the book as he prepares himself to die. Yes he killed without regret but he also killed without malice. Killing is definitely wrong and should be punished but the trial reveals to us how we are all essentially slaves to a system not of our own design or even approval. Meursault is an amoral man living in society but not of it. Must we punish each man as one? Does not society enslave us to a system that in many ways for many people is not suitable? <br /> <br />That, I think, is the message of this book.
B000059TEP|5.0|Ghost: a highly emotional supernatural adventure that touches even the hardest heart. The first time I saw this movie I was blown away by it's magic.   And every single time I watch the movie again, I get blown away by the same magic: every single time.  It has a story that contains powerfull romance, emotion on a high level, comedy, but also very tence situations that will thrill you of your seat.  The combination of emotion and comedy is very well done, which gives a great feel to the movie.     The romance in the movie has some of the most powerfull romantic scenes ever to put on the screen. The love is wonderfull and feels very real, which gives lots of delight.     If you are a fan of Thrillers, Ghost will also entertain you, cause some of the scenes are very tence and frightning.   The scenes will be in your mind for some time.    The casting couldn't have been better. Patrick Swayze does a perfect job as the man who dies but lets heaven wait for a while.  Demi Moore acts strong as the lover who stays behind and gives one of her best performances.   Whoopi Goldberg: defenitly a bullseye hit (she won an acedemy award for this roll) completes the fine main character cast.    The music is soft and beautiful, but also very surprising and frightning. It makes this movie complete and also worthwhile.      Being a fun comedy and a strong emotional story that won't keep your eyes dry, Ghost is a one of a lifetime experience that you have to see.   It touches your heart, wanting you to believe.  So if you are a movie lover, or someone who wants to see one of the greatest movies ever made, I highly recommend you this movie, cause you'll never think the same way about death, love or movies again.      This movie is timeless, and will stay loved forever.
B000AONOLI|5.0|Ce film est vraiment extra, curieusement (et injustement) peu connu mais toute personne ayant aimé l'humour d'aladin adorera Kuzco ! A chaque fois que j'ai fait découvrir ce film à quelqu'un il a adoré ! C'est vrai qu'au premier abord on a pas très envie de le découvrir : Histoire d'un roi changé en lama, ça se passe au pérou, le dessin est assez particulier... Mais alors, on est agréablement surpris tant on n'arrête pas de rire ! Les grands passeront un très bon moment, j'en met ma main à couper, foi de lama ! :o))
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|This \\"fish tale\\" is generally a nice story about a father who tells tall tales for years to everyone and has a son who has resented those stories, thinking his father was nothing but hot air. The big pluses for this film were the colorful scenes and the fact that is was simply a nice story.  <br /> <br />Since this is a Tim Burton film, it's no surprise that the visuals are so entertaining but it is a surprise that the story isn't a dark one. I guess that disappointed a lot of his fans but thought it was a Irefreshing change of pace from him, and I appreciated his effort here. It's the kind of movie many folks wish they made more of today. <br /> <br />The fun parts of the film are not the beginning or ending but the middle in which the dad's stories are brought to life. There are some strange and fun characters. The story is a bit too much New Age/reincarnation mumbo-jumbo but the whole thing is so bizarre that you can't take anything seriously....except the father-and-son relationship, of course, which is meaningful. That may be a bit heavy but almost all the film is a lighthearted fantasy.  It looks great on disc, too!
B0006399FS|4.0|There's one key thing to consider when checking out a new U2 album - their albums have a history of 'growing' on people. Lukewarm reception often turns into solid critical and public admiration and sometimes extreme fandom. It's impossible to say whether or not an album or band is good after one listen, or after hearing a few singles over the years and then dismissing the band. In short: Give Atomic Bomb a chance, and come back when you've formed a complete and comprehensive opinion.
B00005M91K|3.0|I can't get the awful images from this documentary out of my mind. At first it was a wonderful documentary- no words, just images and moody music. Images of fascinating things around the world that you wouldn't normally see yourself, such as religious ceremonies in far away places. But then it started to show really disgusting things- like cute little baby chicks being abused on an assembly line, and then some man with very ill-looking eyes making horrific faces, perhaps having a seizure. At that point I decided it was not ok for  my child to see and turned it off. I can't stop thinking about those poor little chicks. Definitely glad I only eat organic eggs. I guess that's what the point of the documentary was. But I was expecting beautiful images.
B000000OF6|3.0|\\"Greatest Hits\\" (the single disc with the pink cover) and \\"Classic Queen\\" (with a blue cover) are the two CDs this 2-disc set was based on, except by buying the two single discs (instead of this) you'll get a slightly better song selection. <br /> <br />This 2-disc edition unforgivably omits \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" and \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\".  \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" is a a great rocker and live favorite, and \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" is a classic thrasher that influenced the likes of Metallica.  Both songs are on the \\"Classic Queen\\" album...but have been replaced on this 2-disc set with some lesser '80s pop tunes.ihm auch mal von Bassist Didz Hammond (Ex-The Cooper Temple-Clause) geleistet (\\"You fucking love it\\").   <br /> <br />Es ist ein steiniger Weg, aber das Licht am Ende des Tunnels ist bereits in Sicht: \\"I'm finding different paths now/I never saw before/And it hurts less every day/The paths lead me away/Lead me away from those/Bloodthirsty Bastards making plans for noone/But themselves\\", heißt es in \\"Blood Thirsty Bastards\\". Ja, Carl Barât und seine Dirty Pretty Things haben den richtigen Weg eingeschlagen: Mit \\"Waterloo To Anywhere\\" ist ihnen ein wunderbar aufregendes, berührendes und in sich stimmiges Album gelungen, das durchaus mit den großartigen Platten der Libertines mithalten kann.
B000CDIOYO|5.0|Owning 6 LP 5 CD 1 VCR and 3 DVD different performances of this incomprable work, and having listened to the composer's works live at St. Thomas and St. Nikolai churches, gives me a perspective of what, to my mind, comes close to his idea of the nature of this magnum opus and how it should be performed. The ongoing 'debate' about the authenticity of the contemporary love affair with  original instrumennts and the virtues of austere cool and \\"analaytical\\" performance has no merit. <br />Rather, the interprative divergence has to do with the conductors' concept of big and extrovert vs. small and introvert point of views. Of comparative interest is  the Mengelberg Palm Sunday 1939 live performance at the Concertgebouw and the Lehman 1949 performance at the St. Hedwig's Cathedral. The former extrovert and idiosyncretic the latter austere, personal, dignified, penetrating. This dichotomy between the bombastic and perhaps \\"catholic\\" and the austere and decidedly 'Lutheran\\" has persisted to this day. Richter's interpretation is somewhere in between. He approaches the music on a deep personal and devout level but executes it in a rather bombastic way with instrumental and vocal forces of almost titanic proportions unheard of in Bach's times. Therefore the shear tonal volume belies his understanding of the nature of the narrative and the music. Nevertheless Richter's performance is here to stay, integral to our heritage. The soloists in this recording vary in quality ,the stellar among them are the evangelist par excellance Peter Schrier, the incomprable Walter Berry and a magnificent Julia Hamari. The camera work is very good although the side and from the behind shots of the soloists are pointless. <br />The sound quality is good. For the consumate Bach lovers this DVD is a must to own.
0062502182|5.0|As a boy in Spain, Santiago questions and wants answers about himself and about the world around him.  Sensing his son's restlessness, Santiago's father offers his son the share of what would have been his inheritance so Santiago may buy a flock of sheep and become a shepherd.  Santiago does not know it at the time, but that event is a keystone in what will become his life's journey.<br /><br />Over time caring for his flock, Santiago learns a great deal about people, about society, and about himself.  Still, the life of a shepherd is restrictive. Soon Santiago realizes he needs more.  After a serendipitous meeting with an unusual man who claims to be a king, Santiago learns he must follow his own \\"personal legend\\" if he ever hopes to fulfill his restless heart.  After a succession of seemingly chance meetings with a gypsy, a fortune-teller, a thief, a crystal merchant, a traveler, a beautiful dark-eyed girl, a master alchemist, and a warlord, Santiago finds himself lying prostrate before the Great Pyramids of Giza, where he believes his destiny, his treasure, lies.  While he approaches his objective, Santiago begins to understand the value of omens while satisfying his personal legend and gaining knowledge only a few other souls have possessed.  Through fulfilling his personal legend, Santiago finds treasures beyond his wildest dreams.<br /><br />In `The Alchemist,\\" Paulo Coehlo weaves a story that is a figurative biography of the life fulfilled, of a fearless human being, and of and a emotional state to which many of his readers will undoubtedly aspire.  Using a dreamy, almost transcendental writing style, Coehlo creates an experience for the reader that is not quite like that provided by any other contemporary author.  Consider Coehlo's description of the emotions young Santiago experiences when he falls in love for the first time:<br /><br />\\"At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him.  When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all other world spoke - the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart.  It was love.  Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert.  Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well.  She smiled, and that was certainly an omen - the omen he had been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life.  The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in this books, in the crystal and in the silence of the desert.\\"<br /><br />In spite of this wonderfully illustrative language of love, `The Alchemist' is not a love story.  It is the story of a man's life journey.  The moral is an oxymoron of the simplicity of a warm wind blowing on one's face and the impossible complexity of the web of life that touches each one of us and the thousands of others whose lives we affect through our daily interactions.  Yes, love is a part of that journey - an important part, but it is only still just a part.  `The Alchemist' is much more.  It is the story of realizing one's purpose on this earth.  In his self-actualization, Santiago becomes so much more to the world and much more to the people around him.<br /><br />So does the reader.d into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all other world spoke - the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart.

B000002LQR|5.0|First off, I'd like to state that I'm not a RHCP mega-fan. Having said that, this album is my favourite album, by anyone, ever. It's also worth saying that if you consider yourself an avid Chili Peppers fan on the basis of 'By The Way' then don't bother with this album. You will have probably heard 'Under The Bridge' and read that this album is their greatest offering, (which is true) therefore will expect more of the same mellow type material as heard on 'By The Way,' and the aforementioned mega-hit off this album. You will be bitterly disappointed. This album is funk metal through and through, and the singing is mostly in the rap style. So....if you're open minded, and want to know what the true Chili Peppers are all about, read on.    The Chili Peppers first 2 albums, (self titled and Freaky Styley) sound to me like nothing more than kinda enjoyable but very amateurish funky jam sessions. It came together in a big way with 'Uplift' with far superior melodies and actual songs! That album, and the subsequent 'Mothers Milk' (which was the first album with the current line-up, and the same line-up as on BSSM) had many a highlight, and I love those albums too. However, BSSM was a giant leap in every respect. With Rick Rubin at the production helm this album sounds like real funk rock pros who know they're at the top of their game, and they set out to create their greatest work. They succeeded totally.    Every single track, with the exception of 'They're Red Hot' (which was obviously intended as a joke throwaway, so it's forgivable) is a 10* winner. Tracks 1 & 2 flow seamlessly together to create an amazing opening medley of pure funky rock with soaring choruses, and cutting lyrics. Flea slapping his base like never before, John playing in a far heavier style than we're used to now and Chad anchoring it all down with some of the clearest drumming ever recorded. Along with 'Under The Bridge', (and to an extent 'I Could Have Lied') 'Breaking The Girl' is the other all out \\"slow\\" track and is equally as great as its more famous cousin. The lyrics aren't as good, but the music is better, with Chad banging out a solo on scrap metal. Bizarre but perfect, it's a beautiful track.    I'm not gonna review every track, but suffice to say, most of the rest of the album continues in the same funk rock vein as set out in the first 2 tracks. 'Funky Monks' is one of my favourites, with an explosive guitar solo from John, which I relish all the more, cos I know he'll probably never lay down such a sound again, (here's hopin with Stadium Arcadium!!). Of course everyone knows 'Give It Away' and it is undeniably superb, but IMHO not the best funk rock song on this album by a long shot. For me, the title track outstrips it, as does 'The Righteous And The Wicked' with its ace bass riff and powerful chorus. 'My Lovely Man' is another highlight, as it's a lyrically beautiful tribute to the late great Hillel Slovak, their original guitarist, and sonically a great rocker, with John yet again unleashing an amazing extended guitar solo. Also of note is 'Naked In The Rain' which is unremarkable, compared to the rest of the album, (which means that it's still great) but it does contain an awesome slap bass solo from Flea, which really rocks. Hard.    For me, the real last track of the set, and the best, is 'Sir Psycho Sexy' and it's a brilliant way to finish. Yes, the lyrics are pornography in an audio form, but even on 'By The Way' the lyrics are pure filth, (not to this extent, granted) so it's what the Chilis are all about, only on this track they take it to the extreme! The first half of the song is a funk rave-up, in the style of most of the rest of the rest album, but then just over half way through, it breaks down into for me what is the most beautiful music on the whole album, (not acoustic like 'Under The Bridge' etc. but simply music that floats, in a tripped out manner). It's a classic Chilis song.    Again, I implore you to steer clear, if you'rea hardcore 'By The Way' fan and expect this to be similar. It isn't really anything like 'By The Way'....having said that, if your favourite track off 'By The Way' is 'Can't Stop' then you may want to give this a spin. It's a long album though, and heavier than 'Can't Stop' but don't dismiss it; endure and hopefully you'll get to love it as I do. It angers me to some extent how few songs were included off this album on their Greatest Hits album. You'd be better off buying 'What Hits!?' 'Greatest Hits' and BSSM. This really is their best album.    A seminal release. Cheers for reading.
B0000024LN|5.0|When redman burst on the scene back in the early 90's, w/ EPMD, the hiphop world didnt know what hit 'em. An MC with a crazy flow, obscure voice and insane lyrics, From NJ, was displaying talent never seen before. in 1992, Whut? thee album confirmed the expectations that heads had for him, and more. With the funk doc steez, addictive flow and his general aura it was an instant classic. Then, Dare iz a darkside came in '94 with its darker, more insane & slighty more weird sounding material , proving that Red could switch his style up when he wanted, and proving that there was more of a darkside to him, unlike what was displayed in his debut. Then, in 1996 Muddy Waters dropped. What can I say? Arguably his best, with both styles (Funk Doc & Darkside) mixed into one it is the perfect package for any real hiphop head. with Erick Sermon on the boards, the beats aint nothin less than brilliant, addictive and the perfect foundation for Red to kick some of his best lyrics ever. Red really stepped up his game on this one, with lyrics (and a unique flow) that make you want to rewind & rewind. Even though this is an album in which redman pretty much does most songs by himself, artists like; K SOLO, Keith Murray, Jamal, Meth & a few others also drop by, leaving you with some sick lines that only help the track become even more dope!  Take it from me this is the real redman (& Erick Sermon) before their fall off, big time, forget anything from here on after, this is the funk doc kicking it REAL for 1996. Seriously slept on and judged upon as a \\"typical redman album\\", Muddy waters is another extension to the fact that the Early -Mid-90's were the HIP HOP Years, and grab a hold of it whilst you can. Don't sleep!   WHUT? THEE ALBUM, DARE IZ A DARKSIDE & MUDDY WATERS = REDMAN  Get it. PEACE!!    Lyrics - 10/10  Beats 10/10  Originality - 10/10  Style - 50000/10!!

B000002MNL|5.0|Vauxhall And I is a perfect example how beautiful and elegant modern rock music can be and shows just what kind of masterpiece Morrissey and his boys are capable of putting out when they put their minds to it.<br /><br />the spine-tingling moments begin right from the start with the hauntingly gorgeous strains of \\"Now My Heart Is Full.\\" it's one of those times where Morrissey's voice just sounds absolutely perfect. dripping with elegance nestled with a late-night intimacy that overtakes the mind and quickly absorbs the listener into this world of \\"raincoated lover's puny brothers.\\" it's a time when it genuinely feels really really good to be a fan. this song alone warrants purchase of this album, but luckily every song on here is a keeper. \\"Hold On To Your Friends\\" finds the band shuffling with some charming melodies and great playing...especially the drummer; who laces this number with tasty and respectful fills. \\"The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get\\" stands out on this cd as one of the all-time definitive Morrissey songs...for the musical aspects as well as the spot-on lyrics. one of the nice surprises on this record is the closing track \\"Speedway\\", which begins nice enough with some melancholy strumming of guitar...then suddenly, a chainsaw rips forth from the background! it sounds crazy, but it works so wonderfully to gently propel the song into it's primal drumming and serves as an appropriate and astonishing album finisher.<br /><br />the production on Vauxhall And I could not have been any better. every instrument is precise and sounds lovely and everything seems to be smeared in a blurry lavender opaque sound with Moz's vocals gently riding the crest. a fine album and certainly one of the finer times for Morrissey and crew.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|I think that, without Jamie Fox or Jake Gyllenhaal, this movie would have sucked. Something about these two actors just seemed to click in the movie and the plotting. They acted their roles with brilliance and were as convincing as if they had actually lived the lives of the marines in this story.<br /><br />The story itself follows one marine through his training all the way up to the last hours of Desert Storm. During this time, we see a soldier's life during Desert Shield, before the war with Irag began, and just how difficult life was, and how boring as well. It is so boring, in fact, that the soldiers want nothing more than to put at least one kill underneath their belts. Yet Jake Gyllenhaal and his comrades are sniper scouts, marines who see little action as it is, and getting those kills is going to be difficult. What follows is actually a slow decent into insanity for some of the soldiers, or constant paranoia about life at home, and what they may be missing. When all put together, it's actually more of a character study than anything else, since Jake Gyllenhaal's character goes through all of these emotions.<br /><br />What I liked most about this movie was the simple fact that it's a true story, as well as it's based during the Gulf War. We get to see little of this relatively pointless war, and when a movie is made about it, I'm generally excited to see it. And thanks to some well-acted characters as well as the true-story backing, it adds some concrete to what had looked to be an unstable mix. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Three Kings (the only other Gulf War movie I know of). It's a funny and occasionally emotional journey into the lives of some very bored marines.zum Film und ein Action-Special. Mehr kann man kaum verlangen, da gibt's nichts zu mosern, da braucht man eigentlich auch keine \\"Special Edition\\". <br /> <br />Statement allgemein / Bewertung: <br />Jerry Bruckheimer (\\"Pearl Harbor\\" / \\"Armageddon\\") birgt als Produzent immer für Qualität und wird auch bei COYOTE UGLY seiner Reputation gerecht. Natürlich ist die Geschichte von \\"kleines-Mädchen-kommt-in-große-Stadt-und sucht-ihren-Traum\\" nicht unbedingt neu und bleibt trotz der guten Inszenierung und gut aufgelegten Schauspielern irgendwo vorhersehbar. Das tut aber dem Unterhaltungswert, welcher sich eigentlich durch die ganzen 96 Minuten Filmdauer zieht, keinen Abbruch. COYOTY UGLY ist nicht das, was man als \\"Jahrhundertfilm\\" bezeichnen würde, trotzdem wird aus den erprobten Zutaten Lovestory, starker Sound und heiße Mädels ein scharfer Film-Cocktail gemixt. Solide Fernsehunterhaltung, die DEN Preis allemal wert ist. 4 Sterne und uneingeschränkte Kaufempfehlung. <br />
B000002UHG|2.0|Cover art by Strom Trogerson, keyboards by Rick Write and Anthony Moore (who participated in the album by Pink Floyd \\"A Momentary Lapes of Reason\\"), great drummer Manu Kache (Sting, Jan Garbarek), guest vocals by Sinead O`Connor - and you are ready for new good album in style of Pink Floyd music... You are fooled. Instead of it you would get an hour of depessive dark ambiental atmospheric music, and two songs with the voice of Sinead (\\"Reaching for the Rail\\" and \\"Breakthrough\\") - the only resorts from this dull boring repetivity. Despite that it is not true ambient record sometimes it is hard to define one song or track from the other. Do you remember the song \\"Don`t Leave Me Now\\" from \\"The Wall\\"? Would you like to listen to such kind of music (of course without guitar solos by David Gilmour) for an hour? If so, this CD is for you. By the way, after the first listening I liked this album, it seemed to me original (probably because I fell asleep while listening to it), but after the second I understood why Rick Wright was fired from Pink Floyd after the recording of \\"The WAll\\". It is hard to believe that this CD was recorded as rare solo effort by the same person, who played keyboards on \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Animals\\".  So I could recommend this album only if you had heard all albums by PF and all solo works by Roger Waters and David Gilmour and you are hungry for something new and prepared to experience disillusion...    Warning!!! If you decided to buy this CD - be careful - they sell it with CD by Gilmore \\"Ritualism\\" - this is not David Gilmour from Pink Floyd!!! He is different person!
B00007KWHG|5.0|This has got to be the best one-disc compilation of the band that's out there.  Rhino have once again done a great job in remastering this album so that the sound quality is very, very good.  All the great Four Seasons tracks are here as well as the great solo works of Frankie Valli like \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\", \\"Grease\\", \\"Oh, What a Night\\" and \\"My Eyes Adored You\\".  With 20 tracks on one disc, you also get great value for money in addition to the great tracks selections and great sound quality.  Highly recommended.
0803726570|5.0|This is just a perfect book for reading aloud. <br />My children never tire of hearing the lyrical prose and I have read it in classrooms too with all eyes and ears glued to the words. <br />Julia Donaldson has a way to make the book enticing to the child and still very enjoyable for the adult who reads it to them. <br />The illustrations are beautiful too. <br />I highly recommend this and in fact all of Julia's books.
0440237688|5.0|I volunteer in an elementary school library.  I saw this book and thought it looked interesting.  I loved the wholes series so much that I bought them so my son would have them when he got a little bit older.  I am not usually much for fantasy but I really liked Lowry's style and ideas.  Just one more view of what the future of humankind might hold.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|What can I say? A true fan of David Gilmour can only bow down. Hes given us a very Pink Floydish/Gilmour cd. The foremost being the moreover. The guitar work that many of us languished in for so many years, lost, now returned on On an Island. A magnificent peice of work, reccomend to any fan of David's Floyd or solo buy this piece of art, your collection wont be full without it. On and one last thing \\"Take a Breath\\" (One of the Hottest sounding Rock Floyd releases) <br /> <br />
B000244EMO|5.0|Few action films get the blood pumping and your heart pounding like this action packed Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle from the director of \\"Die Hard\\", John McTiernan. Though not the greatest sci fi action flick ever made (\\"Aliens\\" will always hold that title), it si still one of thebest pure action adventure movies ever made.<br /><br />Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and a covert rescue team are sent into the Central American jungle to infiltrate a hostage situation. By the time they arrive, the hostages have been killed and the terrorists are ready for attack. Fortunately, Dutch and his men are tough and ready, and blow them out of the water. However, there is something else out there. A creature that blends into the forest, unseen. A beast that is killing off the team one by one. A hunter.<br /><br />A predator.<br /><br />As the team members are continually killed by the creature, Dutch and a Central American named Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) are the only ones left. And when Anna is rescued, Dutch is determined to face the beast alone, and hope that he'll make it out alive.<br /><br />This special edition is loaded with bonus features, but it's the film that you will want to watch again and again.
B00005JLEU|5.0|When the movie released at the Japanese theater years ago, it broke chart records and won awards. We know a masterpiece when we see one. I still enjoy this film after eight times of viewing. <br />Chihiro and her parents were moving, on the way Chihiro's father was drawn by curiosity towards a mysterious cave, which leads (on the other side) to Chihiro's adventure. Her parents turned into pigs by eating the food meant for others, and to rescue them, Chihiro gets guided by Haku to find a job at the Onsen (Hot Spring) hotel. <br />This movie is not only an entertainment about Chihiro (or \\"Sen\\", \\"Chi\\"'s other Japanese pronounciation)'s adventure, but it also has educational means. At first all we see are monsters, (Notice Yubaba's three grotesque green head heplers?) but behind that, we take in from this film most naturally, that you have to work hard to get to a decent place. And, the memorable period when Chihiro pulled the bicycle out of the River God to release all the trash people have been dumping inside him, it cries out for saving our enviornment. Oh, and if you eat like pigs, you'll really become pigs. <br />This film is so good, I still want to watch it. By her kind heart, Chihiro befriends all people, rescues Haku, and helps him find out his real name. Chihiro remembers herself, through her short period in the enchanted land she still does. The ending is happy, she gets to go back to her own world. If Chihiro wasn't sorry to leave the world at the end of the cave, I sure was!!! There is so much to the ending! Thus is Chihiro's spiritual adventure. Enjoy Spirited Away!
B000050HTO|5.0|One of the few rock artists who can truly be called a genius is Bob Dylan. He is also one of those artists who in order to have all of his best work, you need to buy the full albums. However, there are some people who only want cd by Dylan in their collection.<br /><br />If you are that kind of person, I strongly recommend that you seek out the two disc, 30 song \\"The Essential Bob Dylan\\". This collection has pretty much all the material a novice Dylan fan would need, including classics such as \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\", \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\", \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\", \\"Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35\\", \\"Hurricane\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Jokerman\\" and the Oscar winner \\"Things Have Changed\\", as well as several underrated gems. The songs are all digitally remastered, meaning that they sound better than ever.<br /><br />If you only want one Dylan cd, than this is the one to go for.
B00005JOFQ|2.0|It's hilarious. A boring, pointless, stupid, plotless, depressing, random film like this one only needs one thing to get the world's attention: [...] characters. Wow! can you believe it? they're [...], and they're having sex, and all the people of the world are watching, and they got Oscar nominated! This attitude is even more homophobic. It's like that time the black guys got the Oscars... that's even more racist, let's give the african american community an oscar night! Iuck, disgusting.      Bottom line: Imagine this movie of 'forbiden love' was about a man and a woman instead, what you got? Nothing. Boredom that goes on and on for a really painful couple of hours. Not even the good acting makes it, since a half hour into the film you are already sick of the same whining faces... oh my god, there's just not enough bad things I can say about this movie. Wake up, please, we have to stop supporting pointless films that don't contribute to film-making, show nothing new, are boring, and take the place of many other good films just for the fact that they deal with a \\"socially touchy\\" issue.        The only reasons I give it two stars are Santaolalla's great music and Prieto's amazing cinematography. But other than that...nching scene dong the washing up with Heath Ledger after a family dinner. <br /> <br />However, an essential film, and one that will always make an emotional impact on its audience throughout its history.  I feel a better film could still be made of this story; shorter, rawer, less pretty actors, but I doubt Hollywood would make it.
B000063COX|5.0|The first effort of Iron Maiden, the legendaric metalband which has spend his time mostly with Bruce Dickinson. But it was Paul Di'anno who has done the vocals on the first two cd's. I also think that Di'Anno gave a different and heavier sound to Maiden. This is also the only Maiden album to feature Dennis Stratton on guitars. Prepare for a heavier album that Iron Maiden has ever released!<br /><br />The album is everything but boring, there is enough change in the songs, and the guitarplay is interesting together with the vocals. This album starts with the masterpiece Prowler, the melody and the voice's combination... wow! Sanctuary is a swinging rocker which got me into Iron Maiden!!! Remember Tomorrow begins like a ballad, but unlike the real ballad on the album Strange World, which by the way is the best vocal apperance of Di'Anno, it explodes into an instrumental chorus. Running Free is the rocking hit of the album, which is kinda funny as well. Phantom Of The Opera is in my view the best Maiden song ever, together with a few other songs. Transylvania is instrumental and it is followed by Strange World. Charlotte the Harlot is a fast one with funny lyrics. And the album closer IRON MAIDEN is legendaric...<br /><br />I recommend this album to every Maiden-fan, especially to fans who adored Killers.<br /><br />Keep On Rocking!! \m/
B000A32KJQ|5.0|I am a Tomasz Stanko fan.  I tried this CD on a whim since Tomasz was playing on it.  I absolutley love it.  A very beautiful CD that is very pleasing to my ear.  Wonderful, slow, rhythmic melodies.  One of my all time favorite Jazz CD's and I have ~ 1500 of them.lt, bei mir hat das fünfmal Hören gebraucht, bis ich mich an das Lied gewöhnt habe, ist dann wirklich sehr gut! 9(10) <br />9.Intension:Sehr sehr schiefes Lied! Sehr sehr ruhig! Sehr sehr krummer Basslauf! Merkwürdiger Gesang! Und dann in der Mitte dieses Melodiechen, das der Himmel geschickt hat und bis zum Ende in allen Varianten durchgespielt wird (Seufz)! Genial! 10(10) <br />10.Right In Two:Fängt auch ruhig an, mit einer schönen Akkustikmelodie, der Gesang ist typisch Tool-Gesang, beste Singmelodie der CD, viel Bongo-Arbeit (wie in anderen einzelnen Liedern der CD), aber hier am häufigsten vertreten, in der Mitte folgt (nach Spannungsaufbau) sehr geiles Riffing, zieht mit! Ruhiges Ende! Fast so genial wie der Titelsong! 11(10), ach verflixt! 10 (10) <br />11.Viginiti Tres:Das Endstück, irgendwelches Schlaginstrument wird da auf merkwürdige Art und Weise behandelt!

B00005KB9T|5.0|one ting immediately comes to mind when i listen to this disc... and that is, tight rythmn section.  Aston and carlton barrett produced the heaviest, tightest rythmn section the planet has seen to date.  I don't know if this album was originally released in the summer, but the beats have a lot of heat coming off them.  I can only picture listening to \\"stir it up\\" and \\"midnight ravers\\" on a hot, sultry summer night.  \\"Slave driver\\" is my favorite wailers song, period.  That song takes one on a painful journey over the unprecendented, melodic, soulful chorus of tosh, bunny and marley.  The harmonies on \\"concrete jungle\\" interspersed with marley's lead are beautiful...and even though i wasn't old enough to understand that music lost wonderful possibility when tosh and bunny left, after listening to this disc i lament the fact these guys couldn't stay together.  i really don't like tosh's lead vocals as much as marley, but the harmonies on \\"400 years\\" and \\"stop that train\\" make these songs almost as powerful as the ones where marley takes the lead.   <br /> <br />This disc is a good combination of political, biblical, romantic and sexual songs.  Marley's later albums had many more conspicuous political tracks on them.  This album, lyrically speaking, is like a combination of \\"kaya\\" and \\"rastaman vibration.\\"  There are heavy political statements like \\"no more troubles\\" and then there are songs about everyday things like \\"kinky reggae.\\"  I really like the lyrics on the first four tracks, because they aren't as hit-you-over-the-head as \\"no more troubles,\\" ironically making their messages come across stronger.  These four tracks remind me of the harlem renaissance writers, who allowed readers to transcend white u.s. culture and feel the obsurdity of the contradictions in the system (\\"it's only a machine that make money\\").   <br /> <br />I'd have to say the two tracks added to this remaster are my favorite, except for \\"am-a-do\\", out of all the others added to the otherremastered wailers albums.  Once again, these melodic, expressive vocals of tosh, bunny and marley make these songs heavenly.  A beautiful disc.
0792849124|4.0|\\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" is certainly the most reverential treatment of the life of Jesus. The 1965 movie was based on the book by Fulton Oursler, which integrated the four Gospels into a single narrative (To appreciate this task just look at the different versions of what Jesus said on the cross according to each Gospel). Reconciling the various versions is not an easy task and while viewers may question some of the specific choices, the only really significant alteration is the death of Judas by throwing himself into the sacrificial pit of the Great Temple, a symbolism that is unnecessarily heavy handed.<br /><br />The choice of Max Von Sydow to play Jesus is an interesting selection to say the least. His slight Swedish accent and closely cropped beard are certainly in keeping with the reverential tone of the film, but I can not help wondering if this was something of a reaction to the more populist Jesus portrayed by Jeffrey Hunter in \\"King of Kings.\\" After all, this was 1965 and the Beatles invasion was underway making male hair length a hot issue. This is a Jesus who is too solemn and too sedate for the most part. There is a nice moment where one of the new disciples comments that he likes Jesus' name. The smile and \\"Thank you\\" that follow are one of the few glimpses of the charisma of the man from Galilee.<br /><br />The strength of the film is in the gorgeous cinematography by William C. Mellor (who died on the set of a heart attack) and Loyal Griggs, and scene composition under the direction of George Stevens. The opening narration goes from the opening verses of John shot over ancient Christian murals to a shot of the manager, ending with a shot of the hand of the baby Jesus as the narrator announces in a most simple manner, \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told.\\" The juxtaposition of images and moments from the live of Jesus is prevalent throughout the film. When Mary and Joseph return from Egypt they travel the road to Nazareth that is lined with the crucified victims of the Roman occupation. The voice of John the Baptist is first heard over a series of aerial shots covering the many miles traveled by all those who came to hear him make straight the way of the Lord.<br /><br />Stevens shows a deft touch in the large scenes involving crowds. The resurrection of Lazarus is down in a long shot, with the focus more on the faces of those who are witnessing the miracle rather than on the actual emergence from the tomb. To the finale of the Hallelujah Chorus a trio of the faithful ran across the plain to the gates of Jerusalem to spread the good news. There is also a wonderful scene of the confrontation between the Roman soldiers and the crowd that had come to the Temple to hear Jesus preach at night and is reciting Psalm 24 (\\"Lift up your heads, oh ye gates). The film also contains some nice small touches. When Pilate presents Jesus to the people, the figure of Satan strides through the crowd to utter the first demand for crucifixion. When Mary Magdalene remembers the promise of the resurrection and Thomas proclaims his disbelief, Peter looks up and sees the smiling face of Lazarus. The musical score by Alfred Newman, Hugo Friedhofer and Fred Steiner is wonderfully attuned to what is on the screen.<br /><br />The main problem is not that there are so many stars in this film--Charlton Heston is an imposing John the Baptist, and Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas, Sal Mineo as Uriah, and Van Heflin as Bar Amand all perform admirably--but rather the cameo appearances that invariably detract from the moment. It is one thing to recognize David McCallum, Jamie Farr and Russell Johnson in \\"before they were stars\\" roles, but it is quite another to suddenly see Sidney Portier help carry the cross or John Wayne silhouetted against the darkening sky as a Roman Centurion. While such cameos may have worked in \\"The Longest Day\\" or \\"It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World\\" during the heyday of the fad, they most certainly do not work in this film.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn this movie was filmed around the Lake Powell region of Arizona, having always assumed it had been filmed in the Holy Land. I would be interested to know which scenes were directed without credit by David Lean (who was finishing up \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" at the time) and Jean Negulesco (\\"Johnny Belinda\\" and the 1953 \\"Titanic\\"). I want to resist the impulse to credit my favorite scenes to Lean rather than Stevens.<br /><br />The reverential tone of the film ends up hurting the pacing so that it seems overlong at 3 hours and 14 minutes. Ultimately I prefer the vitality of Zefferelli's \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" and the monumental performance of Robert Powell as the quintessential Jesus. But there are several lovely moments in \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" and I always end up screening one version at Christmas and the other at Easter. The print obviously needs to be RESTORED and the film really should be seen in the widescreen format, although that makes the credits impossible to read.ie was filmed around the Lake Powell region of Arizona, having always assumed it had been filmed in the Holy Land.

B00005JOFQ|3.0|The scenery in this movie is breathtaking. The framing and photography sweep you into the vastness of twilight prairie and mountain. You feel at the same time at one with nature, and isolated and insignificant in its grandeur. <br /> <br />So I found visual thrills in this movie, but unfortunately not the thrill of any real love story. Yes, there can be tacit love. And yes, cowboys are notoriously taciturn. But there's a limit. Ultimately, human love has to be built on some words, on some shared history, on some weaving of one's individual biography into a shared narrative. And there is none of that here. <br /> <br />Heath Ledger is so choked back and nonverbal in his roll as Ennis that I at first had to turn on the English subtitles to my DVD to catch what few words he is mumbling. There doesn't seem to be any point beyond the sexual in being with someone like him. He has no enlarging view to offer, no wit, no sustaining support. And the Jack Twist character isn't much better. <br /> <br />But the men's failure as lovers goes beyond their inarticulateness. If you truly love someone, you carry a lamp glowing inside you. You see reflections of that person in everyone you meet and so you confer that spark to all your encounters in life. You bring that spark to everything you do. It sustains and animates you. It makes you want to perfect. And there was none of that here. <br /> <br />To the contrary, the two men make the lives of their everyday spouses and girlfriends a misery by their inexplicable unavailability, their withdrawal and lack of essential interest. They are always elsewhere. They are always frozen in disaffection for the ones with whom they might really have forged some bond, albeit not a bond based on any sexual urgency.  <br /> <br />Lust aches. Love lightens. So this relationship never much gets beyond lust. Instead of carrying their forbidden love as a secret charm that could radiate, the two men in this movie schlep through their days spreading a sort of emotional blight wherever they go. Instead of being a tragedy about how prejudice prevented two people from being together, the overriding tragedy of this movie is how often people can't get beyond specific sexual craving in order to joyfully abide in the life that is proffered to them. <br /> <br />Finally, were the namings of these two characters (Ennis and Twist) a little too suggestive? I didn't read the Annie Proulx short story on which this movie is based. So I don't know if her original characters had these names. If they did, it seems to undermine any serious, heartfelt intent for the story. By the unlikely coincidence of these men having Stud Magazine names, it in fact seems to reduce and doom their relationship from the outset to - just sex. <br />
B000F4PD7G|5.0|The Icelandic scenery is enough to make you want to see this movie more than once! I found myself wanting more as the credits rolled.  It contains everything - including well-placed humor - and brings up so many varied emotions.  Beowulf and Grendel was meant to be made and seen by so many.  I've pre-ordered mine on amazon.ca and am hopeful it will come to the 'big screen' in the States.  I want to see it again!!!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|If you are either a Baby Boomer, or Post Baby Boomer, this movie hits you in the gut.  If you are a rocker, and especially if you turn on to Pink Floyd's self-indulgent negativity, this movie brings to you, in graphic detail. All the nightmares they sing about, all the hidden fears and phobias emerge on the screen in bloody detail.<br /><br />It is a picture window into the spiral of insanity.  It is the pictoral record of the effects of dodging uncomfortable emotions and situations, whether through drugs, self-indulgence or merely ignoring them. In all cases, all that is accomplished is adding \\"another brick to the wall.\\"<br /><br />This movie changes Pink Floyd's classic album into a gut wrenching experience, not to be missed.
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|I want to get one thing clear first. I absolutely adore The Strokes from their cool sound to their freakin' clothes. I thought \\"Is This It\\" was awesome and I saw them live that year. Then \\"Room On Fire\\" (aka Is This It 2) came out and everyone was a tad bit dissapointed that musically, the album was all too familiar. Some claimed that it would grow on you in time. Lucky for me, it grew on me like infection! I loved it and I still have it on heavy rotaion now.  <br /> <br />When word got around that the guys had somewhat changed their sound, I became extremely nervous. I downloaded \\"Juicebox\\" and was stunned. It was different. Still, after a few listens, I rather enjoyed it. Dare I say, loved it even. I figured that the whole album would sound like \\"Juicebox\\" and I was OK with that. Bring it on. Then the album actually did come out and I popped that baby in my player right away. <br /> <br />Hmmmm. \\"You Only Live Once\\" sounds like old fashioned Strokes. This is a pretty damned good. Next, Oh glorious \\"Juicebox\\". Then, \\"Heart in a Cage\\", maybe they got distracted. No. I'm sure these guys are just pulling my leg. After the 13th track of waiting for The Strokes to play, I feared that maybe these guys weren't fooling around. \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" IS NOT bad but if you're like me and loved their previous two efforts you might not get what you want. If this is what you call maturity then I desperately pray for a relapse. I'm not ready for The Strokes to sound like The Magnetic Fields a la \\"Ask Me Anything\\". I'm sorry but I want hooks, riffs, sing-a-longs, catchiness, please! And just as I was about to drift away from Earth, \\"Red Light\\" comes on and completely saves the day. What a great song and proof that The Strokes still have it in them. Now, don't get me wrong, I still think The Strokes are a great band and I will definitly see them live again soon but this is a review about what I though about the album. Sadly, 3 great songs out of 14 is not so good. It's unfortunate that this impression doesn't stick and you know what they say; first impressions are crucial.
B00004T8RK|3.0|I think that Light Years has to be the most underrated Pearl Jam song by far. I am shocked by it's pure beauty every time I hear it, both in the music and the words. Insignificance, Grievance, and Nothing as it Seeems are also great songs.
B00005JOFO|3.0|I fail to grasp the overheated enthusiasm for this film. After seeing it, it is no wonder that CRASH won for Best Picture.  It is a slow, unemotional, stilted film.  It never really gets you emotionally involved with the characters.  If this were an ordinary boy-girl \\"love\\" story, it would never have been nominated for an academy award.  I really think that because of the times, the film got more attention than it deserved.

B00005JOFQ|4.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" reminded me of Clint Eastwood's \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" by its mood and pacing. It's one of those love stories that really touch your heart. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is not a simple story, it's about two persons' relationship and this relationship is complex like life itself. Jack and Ennis love each other although none of them are gay as they put it. But Ennis has a wife and two daughters, Jack also has a wife and kid. Besides where they both come from the bonds between two men that are too tight are not appreciated. There's more - they both work as cowboys, usually very manly occupation. But they attracted to each other and they can't do anything about it.<br /><br />This film is about happiness, about how difficult is sometimes to reach it yet it seems to be very close. It's difficult and easy at the same time, you just need to desire it very much. Therefore it's about decisions we make - sometimes wrong, sometimes right, but in the end no one can tell wrong from right. Jack and Ennis could be happy but the price could be the unhappiness of two broken families. Apart from being afraid of publicity they decided not to be happy themselves but also not to ruin the lives of their wives and children. So \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is about moral obligations too.<br /><br />Maybe in other circumstances, in another time Jack and Ennis could live happily somewhere. But the story is set exactly where and when it's set so they had no choice.<br /><br />I guess Brokeback Mountain itself symbolizes every person's dream. It's the place people crave, where they are totally happy. Jack and Ennis were happy there sleeping on the ground, eating beans every day and being cut from the rest of the world. It was their personal paradise. I think if they could they'd live on the mountain, but they couldn't (the reasons don't matter), they've chosen to be happy for a couple of times a year, driving away from everyone else, having just each other, in the place they felt alive. It doesn't matter where they went - even some tatty motel would be their Brokeback Mountain from then on.<br /><br />I think everyone has his own Brokeback Mountain, his paradise, a place where you can be yourself. And it's not always a \\"place\\" literally. Some people finally get there and some not. Jack and Ennis couldn't.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a beautiful and sad story definately made by a sensitive person. And I'd say it's made for the sensitive. Ang Lee deserved his Oscar for sure. If you liked his \\"The Ice Storm\\" and you are not homophobic, you'll apprehend this film.oesn't matter where they went - even some tatty motel would be their Brokeback Mountain from then on.  <br />I think everyone has his own Brokeback Mountain, his paradise, a place where you can be yourself.

0131479415|5.0|This is an extremely interesting book on how to deal with uncertainty of software projects' scheduling. Mike Cohn describes and compares methods for sizing and controlling project work, estimating the time necessary to complete it, and explains which practices do or don't work and why. He has managed to show not just enormous knowledge and experience on the subject, but also to pass his excitement about it. <br /> <br />Written in practical style, the book covers in great detail the science of estimating project size (by using story points and ideal days), intelligently controlling project's and iterations' scope (by evaluating the value of features and prioritizing them), scheduling work (by controlling features and value in each iteration), and tracking the progress. Every statement is supported by statistic, known theory or experience, or common sense. I learned about the Kano's model, financials of quantifying benefits of software, and found support of my own ideas on why managers and developers see things differently. <br /> <br />This book is for grown-ups. I recommend it to project managers and developers who are mature enough to understand that guess work makes everyone's job harder and that software is developed to support business needs that must lead to profit.
B00005BTNA|1.0|Peter Mew (remastering engineer at Abbey Road) continues to play George Lucas by destroying many of my favorite albums. Why does he feel the need to over process everything with noise reduction?  <br /> <br /> <br />STOP SMOTHERING MY MUSIC WITH NOISE REDUCTION!!!!!!  <br /> <br /> <br />Noise reduction sucks the life and space out of music. It makes 24 bit recordings sounds like chirpy MP3s. If you think this remaster sounds good you need to educate yourself with the many audible artifacts left behind from the No-Noise? processing. Once you learn it you'll hear why all of us are upset over its use.hter a bit older than my boys was at first dissapointed in the ventaires because they leaked in her diaper bag while traveling with them... We realized that this is because the bottle caps are NOT meant for preventing leaks while thrown into a diaper bag! They are for keeping the nipple sanitary on-the-go. Therefore when I need to bring bottles on a day trip, I put the right about of powdered formula into the bottles required, and carry around a large water bottle separately. When its feeding time I add water, shake, and have a ready-made bottle! If there is still liquid in the bottle, I cary it straight up in the stroller, or cap it with the solid caps ((sold separately... I found them at BRU)). <br /> <br />All in all GREAT bottles, highly recommended!
0307276902|3.0|generally I love Oprah -- but I think for myself.  And I generally love peeks into how others live.  This book lets you do that.<br /><br />Admittedly, I skimmed through the dental procedure.  it was too much to imagine -- real or not.<br /><br />I suppose we would all have our own very interpretive account of this life -- if it were our own.  My guess is that it's gut-wrenching and sometimes mind-numbing to go through this type of 'clean up.'<br /><br />But, it's a good story, and pretty addictive.  Of course, I loved Eggers' book too -- and this is a lot like it.<br /><br />Everyone, incluing the author, was a bit of a caricature of themselves...but so much of everyday life IS truly mundane and Frey did a good job of including only what I needed to know to move the story forward.<br /><br />If you can look inside this life wihtout judgment it's a great read!

B000AU9UYC|3.0|An insouciant Bruce falls into a backyard well and crashes against a pile of unforgiving rock, only to discover -- or rediscover -- the terror of cacophonous bat wings knifing through the space where he lies prostrate.  Timely Dad, the esteemed and hugely affluent Thomas Wayne, quickly descends the well shaft, offering therapy in the form of mechanically compassionate eyes and bite-sized moralisms, and Bruce's crying subsides.  But the bats aren't terrible or awe-inducing.  The fall may have stung -- even required impressive quantities of antiseptic - but the bats remain uneventful and even superfluous, passing so abruptly and formlessly that attention shifts (contrary to the film's intentions) excitedly to the abyss beyond them, where real childish exploration could happily begin. <br /> <br />In Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins the obvious too often shapes experience. Bat-fear becomes an unfounded fetish for young Bruce, as Dad seems increasingly eager to reinforce his son's effeminate response to inane danger:  whimper, clutch the hand of a deferential loved one, and crawl beneath the bed sheets until a God-like father simplifies life into machismo folly by brandishing marital gifts signifying nobility and a penchant for female objectification.  So Bruce cries and cries -- a tragic commentary on the meekness of privileged children -- until he mistakes costumed actors for bats while attending the opera and (surprise!) cries his parents into an alley where a token criminal shoots them.   Never mind Dad's parting words, whispered to his son with unfittingly eerie stoicism, or Mrs. Wayne's (did she have a first name?) wooden disorientation. Bruce exercises restraint when the viewer expects him to implode; ostensibly unmoved by the finality of his parents' departure, he gazes - almost listlessly -- beyond the immediacy of the crime scene, and the viewer loses him during this moment of uneven malaise - or is it eighty-year-old resignation? <br /> <br />After the formalities of a funeral, a pinch of plot-moving dialogue, and Alfred claiming surrogate-Dad status,  the film indulges a fully mature Bruce (Christian Bale) self-imprisoned in an off-the-map Asian penitentiary, veritably linking adulthood aimlessness with the alleyway slaughter of yore. Importantly, Bale's character isn't convincing as a necessary extension of a traumatic childhood and gripping phobias.  His physical prowess, brooding glances, and witty quips better argue for a curious intellectual in search of higher meaning, a man rejecting the vacuousness of his inheritance and formal education to evolve into something more authentically self-determined.   And when locked into this unnamed despair, Bale entwines primordial violence and youthful ambition and introspection to shine considerably brighter than any previous incarnation of Bruce.   <br /> <br />When Batman finally emerges (ungodly long gestation be done!), everybody's enamored - though only temporarily.  Too quick for the eye to capture, he twists his way through a gaggle of stunned gun-wielding cronies with grace and uncanny precision while sound creates a palpable impression of terror. His greatest skills culminate in an assault equal parts feasible, heroic, and bone-chillingly invisible. Unfortunately, close-ups soon destroy Batman's sexy elusiveness, as Bale doesn't have enough freakishness to settle into the costume, whose short inward-turned ears appear laughably feline.  The Voice ranges from hoarse to overly echoic and scares only when divorced from Bale's over-sized round jaw and curled tongue. And Batman transforms into something unfamiliar: the Batmobile, in desperate need of an ethical overhaul, upends traffic and devours property at a militaristic rate.   At its helm, Batman becomes an uneconomical sensationalist willingly jeopardizing hundreds of lives to secure the safety of childhood friend.  Suddenly, dangling corrupt cops from scaffolds during fits of malice seems arbitrary and cheaply manic, and were it not for the mechanics of a standard good-versus-evil plotline, tripartite Bruce would spin the movie out of control.   <br /> <br />Nolan deserves credit for bravely attempting to harness Batman's psychological genesis - a directorial first.  The visually incessant symbols of Bruce's childhood may strive to provide a believable superhero impetus, but the all-too-dissonant first two Bruces push the film into irreconcilable universes -- unnecessary emphasis on origins reveals Batman as too fundamentally fantastic for real-world explanations and psychoses.  The story becomes invariably entangled in various levels of diffuse contradictions and believability, losing its narrative fidelity and force.
B000BT97AO|4.0|This is not, in any way, shape, form, or mirror, a \\"normal\\" movie.  It is an explosion of creative energy in acting, costumes, set design, and animation.  This is the first movie I've seen where I would suggest that every person that watches this movie ends up with a unique perspective of what they just saw.  This movie is about relationships, desires, wishes, concerns, friendships, art, perspectives, and villians.<br /><br />The most similar movie I can think of, in terms of how it makes you FEEL, is Fantasia, and it is not even that close to Mirrormask.  How about Narnia meets Fantasia in the land of The Dark Crystal?  My suggestion, for those of you who liked Mirrormask, is to now see Spirited Away, directed by Hayao Miyazaki.  Like Fantasia, and Spirited Away, you will see and feel something different every time you see these movies.<br /><br />Did I like it?  I think my skin is still tingling.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|When I heard that Rob Zombie was returning to music I was thrilled. Not that I don't love his movies, because I do, but because I love his music and his music is what made me first fall in love with him in the first place. In a purely heterosexual way... When I heard this I wasn't exactly blown away but that doesn't mean I don't like it. I love it, in fact. This album has been getting a few bad reviews but I think they're being a bit harsh and not understanding what Rob is trying to do. Anyway, I'll get to my track-by-track review.<br /><br />Sawdust in the Blood - Just an intro. It's quite creepy and atmospheric, but honestly the most striking thing about it is that it sounds so much like Marilyn Manson's \\"Godeatgod\\".<br /><br />American Witch - This song is more of a throwback to his earlier songs. Definitely one of my faves on Educated Horses. Instantly lovable. Rob's voice is right on the money here and John 5 shows his skills well. Single worthy.<br /><br />Foxy Foxy - I, like so many others, heard this song first. A different feel to previous songs but I love it. I listened to it over and over when I first got it. A very catchy song.<br /><br />17 Year Locust - A slow, but heavy song. Rob's voice has a very good range here. Easy to get into.<br /><br />The Scorpian Sleeps - A much more pop-oriented song but that's not a bad thing. I can't help bobbing my heard to this one.<br /><br />100 Ways - This instrumental is kind of a continuation of Sawdust in the Blood. It sounds different, but again, reminds me a lot of Manson. Could it be John 5's influence?<br /><br />Let It All Bleed Out - Along with American Witch, this is one of the heaviest songs on the album. I was headbanging all over the place when I first heard this. Classic Zombie.<br /><br />Death of it All - This song is probably the closest thing to an acoustic track that was mentioned when this album was first talked about. A very catchy song with a good beat. One of my faves.<br /><br />Ride - This song starts the last three songs which I can't help grouping together. They all just seem to have a similar structure. I do like this song a lot but it doesn't feel very inspired.<br /><br />The Devil's Rejects - Being in love with the movie, I had hoped for something better but I still love the song. Parts of it definitely do capture the essence of the Firefly clan.<br /><br />The Lord of Salem - Probably my least favourite of the album, not counting the intstrumentals. Again, a good song but not a particularly great one for Rob Zombie. The outro to this song is quite strange...<br /><br />So, perhaps not Rob Zombie's best but definitely worth buying and being part of the Rob Zombie legacy.r />Ride - This song starts the last three songs which I can't help grouping together.

0780622553|5.0|It always happens in cinema: a film comes out that wows critics and audiences love...but it went absolutely nowhere. Which is why it's great that films come out on DVD and you can sort out the good ones from the terrible on your own, without it disappearing a few months into their theater runs. Dark City was one of those films, and although it drew a lot of comparisons to the Matrix, this film actually came out a year earlier since this was 1998 and Matrix was 1999. Oh well, it's a great film anyways and shows The Crow wasn't Alex Proyas' beginner's luck. By the way, fans prefer to turn off the sound during the opening narration so my suggestion is the minute you see Keifer Sutherland's character on screen, turn it back on. <br /> <br />John Murdoch wakes up in a bathtub, confused and disoriented. In his apartment is the body of a dead hooker with odd looking wounds on her chest. To make matters worse, he's being chased by guys in black coats known as the Strangers. I don't want to spoil the rest (because that opening narration would do it for me anyway) but it's a great film with some familiar scenes with a unique twist, including one twist late in the film that caught me off guard. <br /> <br />The film is very much inspired by film noir as probably 97% at least is entirely at night or in poorly-lit buildings. It's a really cool looking film, including one scene where we have a chase while the city goes through a little change. Chase scenes have been done before but this at least makes it unique. It's obvious this is done by the director of the Crow and that's not a bad thing. <br /> <br />The special effects, such as Roger Ebert's slightly I'm-so-movie-savvy commentary says, is it's actually about the story and it's not just a case of \\"look what we can do\\" which was a problem I had with films like the Star Wars prequels and the 2 Matrix sequels. It's funny how he says there's a charm to effects that look slightly obvious which to me is the opposite: it takes me out of the movie when I notice bad compositing or unfinished looking textures (I'm looking at you King Kong). <br /> <br />I would very much recommend this film but like I said, skip the opening narration with the sound off until someone appears on screen, it'll make it much better.
B0008JIJ2E|4.0|Some of you may know that director John Avildsen was fired from the legendary \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977). Amongst other things, he found the content of it too disturbing. We must not write him off as a weak man because of this. The eventual director (John Badham whom I respect very much for his \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" 1977 and \\"Dracula\\" 1979) was to encounter his own problems. After the completion of \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977), John Badham took another job and was fired. The reason was that some suits were horrified at the content of \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" and were frightened that he was going to make their movie just as disturbing. Well, that left the great John Badham free to direct the phenomenal \\"Dracula\\" (1979). All of that said, back to the subject at hand. Between the great acting, the beautiful scenery, and the profound messages, \\"Karate Kid\\" really proves that John Avildsen is a great director. The story starts plausible enough with the fatherless Daniel moving from New Jersey to California. (A potentially difficult situation for any young man.) At first, it looks like he will fit in. He later meets the mysterious Myagi. When we first meet Myagi, we will probably write him off as strange. To Dan's misfortune he runs across Johnny and his gang of Cobras. From this point, Daniel's situation has gone from difficult to dangerous. At one point, Daniel's situation grows so dangerous that Johnny's own friend Bobby is repulsed by the actions Johnny takes against Daniel. At this point, Myagi (whom we may have wrote off as strange) comes to Daniel's aid with very effective results. Daniel obviously wants revenge, but Myagi explains that revenge in the traditional sense does not lead to the desired results...Another interesting thing about this is that with a simple passage, Myagi expands the characters of Johnny and his fellow antagoniosts: \\"No such thing as bad student...Only bad teacher...Teacher say, student do.\\" Myagi confronts the 'bad teacher' and finds himself in for yet another chore. He begins to teach Dan karate to prepare him for an upcoming tournament in hopes that the antagonists will come to respect Daniel or at least leave him alone. Another nice thing about this movie is that Myagi (partially through his unusual teachings) helps Daniel to see that karate is not a sport to injure or kill. Rather, it is a way of life. (Most viewers will probably be able to guess what is behind Myagi's teaching style before Daniel does.) One of the most beautiful things about this movie is that without blatantly stating it, Myagi becomes a surrogate father to Daniel. This is close to obvious when Myagi gives Daniel a birthday party and a car. As if this beautiful scene needed anything else Myagi gives him a gentle caution: \\"Just remember, a driver's license won't replace brain or eye.\\" Finally, there is the climactic tournament. Interestingly, Myagi's theory of: \\"No such thing as bad student, only bad teacher\\" surfaces to a more prevalent level. Bobby is repulsed by a technique his 'bad instructor' wants him to use,  but is too frightened to disobey the 'bad instructor.' Needless to say, Bobby is overcome with remorse when he sees what he has done. Johnny too becomes nervous about what his instructor wants him to do. (In the start of Part 2, the final falling out of Johnny and this 'bad instructor' will be seen.) Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that while violence was an element of how Daniel overcame his dilemma, it was far from the only element. (All those repulsive action movies that glorify in violence and people getting killed could probably learn several lessons from Mr. Myagi.) If you like this movie, be sure to see \\"Karate Kid II.\\" I'll conclude by saying that I will always respect Director John Badham for his \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" (1977) and \\"Dracula\\" (1979). And I will always respect Director John Avildsen for his beautiful \\"Karate Kid\\" (1984).mself in for yet another chore.

0812524969|2.0|I was expecting a different twist on this film. I was lead to believe that it was not a re-make, but sadly that is what it is and not a patch on the original.<br /><br />I really like Depp, but found him a bit tiresome in this film.<br /><br />Film was fun but only a poor copy of the original.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I decided to buy this DVD because my friends kept talking about how great this show was and I wanted to see for myself. Well, they were right! I was literally glued to this DVD package all week. I managed to finish all six disks in under a week.  <br /> <br />The story line of Smallville is amazing. The characters seem real and believable, unlike other reality show characters and actors. The plot was amazing. This show really adds to Supermans background and gives great depth to his entire life and his younger years as a teenager.  <br /> <br />The events in this season are awsome. New villans show up constantly and always keep the storyline going but yet they don't interrupt the deeper more developing storyline.  <br /> <br />It was really nice to see how Clark develops his powers. It felt, to me as I watched it, that Tom Welling was actually Clark Kent and was actually developing these amazing powers as he grew. Overall this series is a must-see and a thriller. I recomend it to any Superman fan, or anyone who just likes a good storyline, character building, action packed reality series.  <br /> <br />The DVD set really complimented the show. It was nice getting to watch the shows without commercials and the whole menu set up was really nice. I deffently recomend getting the series box set, even if you have already watched the episodes! And all of the bonus features and deleted scenes really added to the series in itself! <br /> <br />Overall this is a must see no matter if you are a huge Superman fan or not!
B0009R1T7M|4.0|This album is the best I've heard this year, and possibly the best of this millennium so far. Sufjan (pronounced soo-fi-yahn) is an absolute musical genius, as Illinois exhibits sheer brilliance not only in songwriting, but in everything about the way this album sounds. The fluttering flutes, touching guitar, and the beautiful, honest vocals all contribute to this album's beauty. I Look forward to everything I will hear from him from this point on.
0679777547|3.0|For what it is (basically an extremely erudite potboiler, somewhere between Umberto Eco and Carlus Ruiz de Zafon), Arturo Perez-Reverte's THE CLUB DUMAS is quite entertaining. It's a mystery involving a mercenary bookseller's attempts to find out the truth about a chapter of THE THREE MUSKETEERS written in Alexandre Dumas's original hand and also a legendary text of demonology in a series of European cities: Madrid, Sintra, Paris and Toledo. There are some truly cringeworthy \\"erotic\\" passages, and some highly florid similes that might have been penned by Mickey Spillane, and the narration by a secondary character seems pretty unconvincing and forced. But for the most part the mystery itself is a fun puzzle and many of its characters are fairly original. if anything, the book is best for pointing readers to the intelligent European potboilers of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries penned by Dumas, Hugo, Sabatini, and Christie, all of which are lovingly evoked (and which provide clues to the book's ending).
0743487583|3.0|Happily for movie-goers, Frankenstein movies resemble this book only slightly.  The pathos (for the movie and the book) is launched when Victor Frankenstein, a young college student, creates a live monster from \\"dead parts.\\"  However, I was surprised to find that Mary Shelley's novel provides no hint of how Victor, after much unexplained experimentation, \\"creates life\\" and animates a collection of bones and other unspecified ingredients.  Further, she fails to explain how the monster is able to quickly and easily become a fluent speaker, reader, and writer with no instruction.  She asks us to accept that the monster, at 8 feet tall, moves undetected, through much of Europe, for years.  The plot is so obviously contrived that the novel fails the most basic test of fiction.  Shelley did not move me to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />Furthermore, all of her characters speak in the same voice.  Parents, children, Victor, the monster, and the narrator/ship captain all sound the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we are reminded repeatedly that Victor is very, very, very tortured and that the monster is very, very, very hideous and evil.<br /><br />I am sure that in her era, Shelly's style was more accepted, even expected.  The overwrought melodrama, the endless agony, and illness and death resulting from torturous melancholia are all Victorian hallmarks.  However, her failures as a writer of fiction made this a difficult, unrewarding read for me.  I allow 3 stars for the dynasty of horror and comedic films that arose from her kernel of a good tale.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best version of Pride & Prejudice I've seen. I own it & watch it often.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I was one of the lucky ones, who was able to see Gilmour in concert last week at the Rosemont Theater in Chicago. He played \\"On an Island\\" in its entirety, which I must admit, did bring it all together. The second half of the show, however, his Floyd set really rocked, with songs seldom heard in concert like \\"Echos\\" from Meddle and \\"What's Uh the Deal\\" from Obscured by the Clouds. Which brings me to the crux of my review. This album is very easy to listen to, as is just about everything David Gilmour does. There is nothing earth shattering here, though, as I was hoping for a bit more edgy Rock & Roll, along the lines of Run Like Hell, or Young Lust, or \\"Dogs\\" three songs David at least penned the music for, if not the words. But I guess those days are over, now that Gilmour is 60 years old, and the much more mellow David Gilmour the song writer has taken the lead. But one can still hope for a song like \\"Coming Back to Life\\" or \\"Take it Back\\" from the more recent History of the Division Bell. None of that either. <br /> <br />I digress, though. I admittedly did not walk away from this album, 100% satisfied, but I'm glad to hear anything Gilmour puts out, and this album does have a crisp sound to it and I've found myself, many times since my first listen, humming the title track as well as the melody from Smile. So overall, I'm very happy Mr. Gilmour spent the time on this, and his solo concert was better then any show I've ever seen before, including the 1988 and 1994 Pink Floyd Reunion Tours. <br /> <br />Anything is good that brings David on the road touring again, and I hope he'll do more, even if it isn't with Pink Floyd anymore. I know, boo hoo. <br />

B000641ZA4|4.0|As for music videos only, which is all this promises, this is an excellent collection, and spans the Genesis career from 1976-1999. Unfortunately, there were only two promo videos featuring Peter Gabriel, one was recorded in 1999 and was included, and the other, I Know What I Like, was not included by request of Peter Gabriel. Although this includes most of the videos, there are a few notable absences, such as the alternate versions of 'Many Too Many' and 'Man On The Corner' which could've been put in the extras section, the video for 'On The Shoreline' which does not feature Genesis in the video, but is a nice video, the video for 'Match Of The Day' which could not be found, and the much rumoured 'Whodunnit?' music video, which may not even exist. But be forewarned, uptodukies, because this video disc contains few videos from before 1981, so if you enjoy the later music, then i would suggest buying this. but if you only enjoy their work up to 1980 (or 1974, which is actually a strange cutoff), then you might not enjoy this.
B000050HTO|5.0|Any Bob Dylan fan will appreciate this album. The songs compiled here are without question amazing, the audio feed on the CD is good and the sound is completely flawless. I also appreciate this CD because it has so many songs on it, I'm sick of seeing best of CD's that contain only 10 songs. This allows you to get the best from all his CDs. I bought this album the other day at best buy for $25, and I sure wish I had looked at Amazon first because this price of $16 and some change is very very fair. This is the best price I think you are going to find on this CD, it being new that is. This CD will not disappoint a Bob Dylan fan, and also for anyone trying to get a quick run down on Bob Dylan this has a great line up of songs.
B00004CP9Y|4.0|This is without a doubt, one of Bill Murray's best films. It is both a fantasy and a comedy flick. The basic premise of the film is simple. A man is forced to relive the same twenty four hours, over, and over, and over again, ad infinitum.<br /><br />Bill Murray is that man. An obnoxious Pittsburgh weatherman, he is in Punxutawney, Pennsylvania to cover its Groundhog Day celebration, along with his beautiful and altruistic TV producer, played by Andie MacDowell, and his patient, long suffering cameraman, played by Chris Elliot. Murray, playing an uncaring, unfeeling wretch of a guy, is, for some inexplicable reason, forced to relive the same twenty four hours in Punxutawney over and over again. Why? Who knows and who cares? What follows next are some of the funniest moments in film.<br /><br />At first, Murray is confused. No one else, however, seems to be. As Murray continues to relive the same day, confusion turns to anger. Ultimately, that anger turns to mischieviousness and indulgence. After all, what would one do, if there were no consequences to one's actions?<br /><br />This premise provides for quite a few, very funny scenes. This puckish foray quickly denigrates into profound despair, as Murray realizes that he seems destined to relive the same day forever. Frequent, subsequent suicide attempts fail to stop the clock, and Murray rethinks his position. He concentrates , finally, on becoming the best man that he can be, with the lovely Andie MacDowell as his romantic interest.<br /><br />Murray's transition from smarm to charm provides for many hilarious scenes that will leave the viewer howling with laughter. The ultimate impact of his transition from Neanderthal man to Renaissance man is, needless to say, a positive one. This redemption will ultimately prove to be be Murray's salvation.<br /><br />Murray provides droll, comedic delivery, and he is perfect in this role. Andie MacDowell is the perfect straight man and comedic foil. Together they make this movie one that the viewer will want to see again and again.ie one that the viewer will want to see again and again.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|the reason that everyone is so indifferent about this album is because it is not the usual strokes album.  it breaks away from the ordinary and does something most bands usually are scared to do, change.  the album is easily their strongest, if you liked it or not. yes, it may not have all the hits but it has the most solid ground behind it.  a great balance between slow and fast gives the album its glow that all albums should have.  casablancas drops the filtered voice on several of the tracks, showing that he can sing, using his voice in more than one octave.  the band backs him up with amazing rythm and lead guitars creating comlex layers of sound that you would never notice if not for the wonders of stereo sound (left ear on \\"heart in a cage\\", amazing!) guitar and keyboard solos show that the band composes their stuff instead of just noodling up and down a scale like many bands do to just waste time on an album.  this album is a definate for those who remotely like the strokes or are interested in them and want to get to know them.
0786915749|5.0|This book was the first written in what became the \\"Dragonlance\\" series of Fantasy novels. It tells the story of eight adventures who after a chance encounter at the inn in their home town are sucked into a grand adventure to safe the world. It seems that five years early seven friends from the town of Solace each went off individually to find evidence that the \\"true gods\\" had returned to the world. It is now five years later and none of them have found any such evidence. But when they return to the inn in Solace they meet a barbarian woman named Goldmoon whose husband Riverwind has recovered a mysterious blue crystal staff. It doesn't take long before they are being hunted by the authorities as well as a mysterious new evil. <br /> <br />I first read this book when I was in the sixth grade at the tender age of twelve. I have to say fifteen (fifteen!) years later the book still holds up. The book is well written and the adventure moves quickly. The authors have created an interesting group of characters, some of whom you immediately like (Tanis) and others that you immediately dislike (Raistlin). They have also created a diverse and interesting world for these characters to adventure in. <br /> <br />These books were originally proposed as companion books to the \\"Dragonlance\\" series of AD&D roleplaying games. The authors freely admit in the back of the book that some of their ideas for the plot come directly from roleplaying sessions. As a result you can practically hear the AD&D dice roll as you read this book. In some of the action sequences at the beginning of the book it is much more painfully obvious then at the end. It doesn't take anything away from the plot but it does add a different element to the reading. <br /> <br />In the end, if you are looking for an adventure fantasy read that is not going to tax you mentally then this book is the way to go. It has a good plot that keeps you interested and characters that you can care about.
6305972591|4.0|First of all lets get the biggie out of the way; This film is NOT as important or as significant as some are making out. There is a justified minority that say 'hooray' for these sort of homosexual policy movies and another minority that are prejudice against people that 'bat for the other side'. I am neither and i am sure most everyday folk agree that this is an average love story but between two men and told brilliantly. So what if its between two men, big deal.<br /><br />  To concentrate on the film is the main concern and it is a very good watch, although perhaps becoming a tad '5 star-ish'. The first 45 minutes are breathtaking in terms of the cinematography and the relationship is built on the foundations that they were both a bit drunk(hilarious). but of course instead of ignoring these sexual encounters and keeping the skeletons in the closet, the two characters fall in love. The middle third of the movie is strangly paced, it seems every bleedin 5 minutes, 5 years go by and this didnt gell with me. But the ending puts it back on form and is deeply heart wrenching. The film is superbly well-acted, especially Heath Ledger who shows a progressive range of emotions as the film flows. Great score too. All in all this is a decent watch but dont be fooled into the politics side of it. Watch it as a bitter exterior over a warm heart and natured film instead and it will grip you. Its just i have seen much better films that are definately worthy of 5 stars. greta film, i guess im just not so generous!

1571103767|4.0|When Confucius wrote \\"before you embark on a journey of revenge, first dig two graves\\" I wonder if he'd seen the script to Munich. Trite I know, but in this most recent of Steven Spielberg's offerings, the old Chinese proverb rings true. In this marvellously crafted tale we see a fictionalised account of the aftermath of the murder of eleven Israeli atheletes during the 1972 Munich Olympics. We see the response - Mossad sending a message to Black September. Avner (Eric Bana) hunts the surviving terrorists and Black September instigators of the atrocity, and along with his team suffers the consequences of the revenge message.<br /><br />The production was located, propped and costumed magnificently - I truly believed that I was looking at the seventies, and it was so consistent across international locations.<br /><br />If I had a criticism, it would be that the movie is too long, but that is just a personal opinion from someone who can't sit still for that amount of time. The DVD will mitigate this somewhat as I could at least hit pause and take a comfort break.<br /><br />An excellent movie, not necessarily telling the tale like it actually happened, but thought provoking and replete with fine performances.

0790734850|5.0|If you missed LA Confidential first time round then you're in for an absolute treat. It's classy, clever and has more twists & turns than you can shake a tail feather at. And if you've seen it before it's even better second or third time through. In fact it's made for DVD - particularly in the last 45 minutes - when you can rewind key segments to keep up with what has to be one of the fastest, complex and most exciting plots you'll come across. The film just oozes atmosphere, with Kim Bassinger's incredibly seductive performance, beautiful cinema-photography and a wonderfully low key soundtrack easing you into what is, in the end, an intensely violent & gripping story.    Brilliant and perfectly pitched there's just one flaw... why on earth did they stick in the last ten minutes. (And, if you haven't seen the film, please do stop here because it really could spoil your enjoyment of it)... it's as though, after constructing a believable and incredibly malevolent thriller someone said \\"it's a bit too black, we need a happy ending, so let's make sure the good guys come through\\". Which is a great shame because it's just not up there with the \\"feel\\" of it all - in the world that you've been sucked into and which, by now, you're quite ready to accept, good guys don't simply drive off into the sunset.    Five stars?... definitely, despite its key flaw. But, with a bit more bravery in keeping it going where it logically should have ended up, it could and should have been so much better.
B00006RINF|2.0|Lacuna Coil is either compared to Nightwish or Evanescence. Nightwish is opera metal, while LC I can barely even call them opera metal without cringing. Cristina just doesn't have the range to be in the same catagory as \\"opera\\". And for Evanescence...Evanescence has reached popularity and LC fans are pissed off, simple conclusion. EV, NW, and LC have different sounds. Nightwish is epic with amazing score and vocals. Evanescence has a melacholic rock/pop sound with good sound effects and composition. LC is between the two lacking the vocals and decent music arrangements.  <br /> <br />For awhile LC has had a KoRn-esque sound. This album really embraces it too much. LC really fails to adapt their own style. The only thing I can take from their band is the vocalist who has a distinctive voice mixed with her accent.  <br /> <br />As for the lyrics, they are boring. The music arrangements mixed with it is even more unbearable. Andrea has no real range as a metal back-up. I could probably tolerate a male vocal only in symphonic death metal and that is really it. Nightwish, Theatre of Tragedy, and Tristania are really the only bands I can stand with male vocalists.  <br /> <br />\\"Heaven's a Lie\\" is a ridiculous song that is too generic. While many complain about Evanescence being a rip-off and too generic, LC  has succumbed to this after so many albums. EV has only had one official album release so I can forgive them on their part. LC has already made a following. EV isn't considered metal and LC has gone one step from metal into mainstream. <br /> <br />\\"Aeon\\" is an example of where LC always fails. This song is just boring. LC has this tendency to use instruments that they seem to believe that will make them sound unique and the lyrics and score is just dragging. There is no real highlights in the song. Another example is the \\"ghost woman and hunter\\".  <br /> <br />The bad thing about LC would be their male vocalist and most of the musicians. Cristina is a decent vocalist and would do better solo. The band doesn't seem to mature but rather become worse by every album. Since her voice is worth listening to I am giving just 2 stars. She doesn't have a lot of range, but her voice is something ethereal or other. If she had more range it would be worth buying this album... <br /> <br />Bands like these that are preferable... Nightwish, Theatre of Tragedy (Liv era), Tristania, Epica, and Leaves Eyes.
B000003TAW|5.0|Pop rock at its finest.  The greatest of a long line of great Weezer albums, The Blue Album blows its post-Grunge competition, such as Sixteen Stone and Throwing Copper, out of the water with the unique combination of consistency and originality-something neither Bush nor Live nor Collective Soul displayed during their careers.  Really, how many albums during the mid-nineties can say that they are both consistent AND original?  Mellon Collie, The Bends, Downward Spiral, Definitely Maybe, Anemia...that's about it!  Actually, The Blue Album's priceless singles are better than any combo of singles off these 5, with the God-sent all-time classic `Buddy Holly' taking the lead.  Fan favorites `Undone-The Sweater Song' and `Say It Ain't So' are another two of Weezer's best, with `My Name Is Jonas' and `Holiday' not far behind.  Also, `The World Has Turned And Left Me Here' is one of the most underrated and underappreciated Weezer classics, as I believe it to be the band's finest achievement to date.  Throw in the almost-creepy `In The Garage' and the nostalgic opera `Only In Dreams' and what we have here is about 3/4 of  Weezer's greatest hits.  Second to Definitely Maybe for my best album of '94.
006056251X|4.0|I was happy with this story but I felt she could have done so much more with these two characters.  I think they both overcame their weaknesses too quickly.  I think the storyline could have better as well.  We didn't see enough of the other girls either which I missed.  I really enjoyed the first two and was really looking forward to this story...I felt a little disappointed.  I think the next story will be Daisy & Cam, so I hope she ends this series on a strong note.
0684824906|5.0|Ever since I read Vidal's wonderful historical novel, which portrayed Lincoln as a person rather than an icon, I have wanted to find a scholarly treatment that would fill out the portrait with detail and corrections if necessary.  Over the last 20 years, I have read a number of biographies and histories from the period, and never felt satisfied with their depth of coverage - that I could get closer to the person who did the remarkable things that Lincoln did, combining high principle with machiavellian political tactics to perfect effect.<br /><br />Well, with this volume, my wait has at last ended.  This book is a masterpiece of historical investigation.  Not only are Lincoln's political skills explained with astonishing clarity in the context of America's greatest crisis, but who he was comes through with genuine warmth.  This is by far the best single volume I have read on the period and surpasses Kearns' previous books by an order of magnitude.  Every single page is utterly fascinating, beautifuly written, and densely informative.  I would give this six stars if that were possible.<br /><br />Kearns explains how Lincoln - apparently poorly qualified and seeming to appear from nowhere - engineered a political career that enabled him to save the Union.  He did so, we are informed, by an uncanny ability to find the right person for the right job, rising above any considerations for egoistic pride or personal slights from the past.  In addition, with the powerful actors he chose - they are described in the Amazon blurb already - Lincoln understood what political currents in the country they represented, forces that he would have to contend with as it were, and which he could ignore only at his political peril.  Apparently, none of his rivals understood this, and it is a key to his genius.  Finally, Lincoln pioneered new means of political communications, as exemplified by the simplicy of the Gettysburg address - reprinted verbatim in newspapers - and the timeless elegance of its sentiments.<br /><br />This brief description cannot do justice to the political complexity that Kearns distills, such as the way that Lincoln presented himself as \\"second best choice\\" at the nominating convention, so that when the obvious candidates failed - as he suspected they would due to factional divisions - he was the only one who appeared capable of satisfying all Whig constituencies in a balancing act.  But there are also the mechanics of his political maneuvering, such as the Cabinet crisis in which Chase tried to discredit him:  Lincoln eventually embarassed him into backing down by exposing his manipulations before his colleagues as well as Senator Sumner, Chase's secret ally.  (This was portrayed as a single instant in Vidal's book - the novelist's indulgence -  but in fact took an entire day of dicussion and machination.)  Thus, for the most devoted political junkie, this is the most delicious gourmet fare.<br /><br />The personal dimensions of Lincoln and his colleagues are also covered in sensuous detail.  The reader feels like he gets to know all of them in a near intimate way, which Kearns uses to explain their behavior and beliefs, as well as their wives and children.  Lincoln comes off as a warm man of great humor and capable of remarkable friendships, who suffered from depression in certain periods that were due to the issues in his life as well as his temperament.  She also interprets many current controversies in historical context, convincingly explaining and hence laying some rather anachronistic ones to rest, such as Lincoln's sexuality.  One of the most interesting, if least likeable, figures here is Salmon P. Chase, the abolitionist whose presidential ambitions were cold and implacable.  His popular daughter Kate sacrificed everything for him, ruining a life that had promised her own brilliant career.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I would criticise about Kearns' approach, it is her tendency to seek the good in people.  This is rather sentimental in my view.  The reader knows whom she dislikes (Chase and McClellan) and likes (all the rest of the Cabinet) all too clearly.  Moreover, with the exception of Chase, she is unwilling to consider the darker side of their search for power and fame.  And so Mary Todd Lincoln is not portrayed as a shrew whose position corrupted and imbalanced her in a very public way - the more accepted view - but as a grief-stricken mother who feels neglected by the husband she loves.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is one of the best history books I have ever read.  What is truly amazing is that Kearns has come up with something so fresh and new in a field that is so overcrowded.<br /><br />Warmly recommended..

B0000AFQS0|5.0|This is without doubt the best music DVD I have ever seen and its hard to see how it could be bettered, short of inventing a time machine and going back to the late 60s/early 70s to see a killer live performance by Daltrey, Townshend, Entwistle & Moon - The 'orrible Who! <br /> <br />Okay, I find it hard to be impartial as The Who are my favourite rock band of all time and even half a lifetime after I first heard them, I still love them and the music, although for me, The Who ended when Keith Moon died in 1978. As another reviewer has noted, it was bad enough that they continued after Keith's death, but to continue after John Entwistle's death and still call themselves The Who just beggars belief. Couldn't they have just called themselves 'Daltrey & Townshend' like 'Page & Plant' have done? At least they could have kept their dignity and the legend behind the name intact that way. But I digress...... <br /> <br />Jeff Stein has done the world a great service by very effectively capturing the spirit of The Who in his 1979 film 'The Kids are Alright'. One of the great strengths of the film is that it was made by a fan and the love he has for the band shows in the film.  <br /> <br />Rather than get tangled up in narration, telling a story or intellectual analysis of what lies behind the band, Stein lets the band do the talking through explosive TV appearances, ear-splitting live performances, heavy feeback, smashed guitars, exploding drum kits, smoke bombs, trashed hotel rooms, zany interviews, short promo films and more.  <br /> <br />Given the amount of material that Stein must have been faced with when he started the project, its to his credit that the end product is so good at effectively capturing the career of the band up until that time - from playing in small clubs in West London in 1964 to mid-sixties European TV appearances, to breaking America in 1967, to the amazing performances at The Rolling Stones' Rock & Roll Circus and Woodstock and well into the 1970s, performing as one of the best live Rock bands on the planet, to finally starting to lose their edge in the late 1970s as Townshend starts losing musical direction and Moon turns into a weathered (drunken) shadow of his former self. <br /> <br />I've owned the VHS version for many years so its great to see the effort that went into the DVD version, right from when Townshend's guitar smashes through the copyright warning; you get more extras than you can shake a stick at.  <br /> <br />Firstly, you get the full 'Kids are Alright' film, including the bits that were edited out of the original (why were they edited out in the first place?) in restored digital film and in 5.1 digital sound (watch the Monterey smash up sequence towards the end LOUD with surround sound - Rock heaven!) In addition to that, you get a short film about how the film was restored for DVD (should appeal to the geeks), a revealing interview with Roger Daltrey in which he explains his take on the film, including how shocked Moon was to see his slow decline on celluloid before his very eyes, two quizzes and 'The Who's London', an interactive tour of places in London that were significant to The Who.  <br /> <br />Best of all, for the Shepperton studios recordings of 'Baba O'Reilly' and 'Won't Get Fooled Again' you can switch between 4 or 6 different cameras in real time to view the performances from the angle you like best. If you're a fan of Entwistle's bass playing, select 'Ox cam' to see John thunder through the two songs or see Moon, loon over his drum kit in his last ever performance with The Who. <br /> <br />There's not much more I can say about this DVD. If you're a Who fan and you don't own this DVD, buy it TODAY. If you like Rock music buy this DVD TODAY. If you're from outer space and want to know what Rock music is, buy this DVD TODAY. Its not just a great document of the band, it also serves to remind us what great rock bands stood for and how anaemic and feeble most bands are today.<br /> <br />Rock is dead, long live The Who!
B000BNX3B4|4.0|No, Must Love Dogs is not a masterpiece. It is not as good a romantic comedy as The Philadelphia Story or Libeled Lady. But it is much better than Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, and most other contemporary examples of the genre. The cast is stellar. And I'm not just talking about the many well-known actors (Cusack, Lane, Plummer, Channing, Perkins, Mulrooney, etc). Probably the best performance of all comes from little-known Jordana Spiro. As Jake's would-be girlfriend, Sherry, she steals every scene she appears in. The filmmakers should have given her more to do. Spiro gets more humor and pathos out of her small role than most big-name actors ever manage to get out of even a starring role. And she's not the only secondary character to shine in this film. Ben Shenkman, as Cusack's friend Charlie, also manages to spin comic gold out of an underwritten part. Yeah, it's a one-note performance, but Shenkman at least manages to make that one note sound as if it is being played on the comic equivilent of a Stradavarius. He manages to make even throw-away lines such as \\"I know I am\\" and \\"Wouldn't that be nice\\" laugh-out-loud funny. <br /> <br />   I'd be less than honest, however, if I did not acknowledge the occasional deficiencies in the script. One problem is the writers' complete disinterest in the characters' backstories. When Cusack and Lane sit together at an Armenien restaurant and  reveal their previous love histories, the viewer gets...absolutely nothing. After going on and on about the need for total honesty in disclosing one's past to a potential lover, Cusack then gives Lane a one-sentence history of his life: He got beat up emotionally by a woman he really loved. That's it. Lane, in turn, reveals every bit as little about her own history. Curiously, Shankman and Spiro, whose characters are intentionally 2-dimensional, manage to make their parts memorable despite this deficiency. Cusack and Lane aren't so lucky. The thinness of their characters makesit difficult for the viewer to empathize with them much. Another failing is more typical of the contemporary romantic comedy: complete economic cluelessness. Lane is a divorced pre-school teacher; Cusack is a boatbuilder who has never sold a single boat. Yet they both live in luxurious digs, she in a huge old two-story bungalow, he in a spacious two-story loft. They drive nice cars and seem to have no financial worries at all. What's with that? The economic struggles of the characters in Zola, Balzac and other great novelists lend depth to their portraits. But in contemporary film, the economics are pure fantasy. No one ever needs to worry about paying a bill or cutting expenses. Had the filmakers of Must Love Dogs rooted the main characters a little more firmly in the real world, they might have given us a romantic comedy with real life. As it is, the film is a frothy and often delightful piece of entertainment with almost nothing to say about contemporary life.
B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminem's second album, The Marshall Mathers LP, is loved by many, and hated by many others! And that's well understood. <br /> <br />I was one of those who hated it. But there's one thing I can't deny, and that is it has some really addictive beats that will make any hip-hop hater...love it! <br /> <br />Eminem, or shall I say Marshall (or is it Slim Shady?), isn't ashamed of expressing his hatred towards his mother (extremely dysfunctional and sick), wife (perverse), homosexuals (I hate them too!), boy bands, the media, and more people. However, Dr Dre's production and Eminem's rhymes are infectious: the vicious The Way I Am, the creative Stan (a song about an obsessed fan), and the satirical The Real Slim Shady. <br /> <br />Whether you agree with Eminem or not, The Marshall Mathers LP is classic hip-hop at its most rotten! <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />B-
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I first stumbled on North and South when BBC America did a North and South marathon one Saturday a few months ago. I immediately checked with Amazon.com and saw all these glowing reports to substantiate what I had just witnessed...What is likely the best miniseries I have ever watched.<br /><br />From the opening scene, through the turmoil of the classes that was the industrial north of that period...to love and loathing between John Thornton and Margaret Hale. The story intertwines the classes and draws you in. It is so hauntingly beautiful and I challenge you to turn off the DVD player after episode 1. Personally, I've watched my DVD to many times to count and always watch the whole series in one sitting.<br /><br />The locations and costumes are expertly recreated, the music is haunting and beautiful and will resonant in your mind for hours after you have finished viewing, but the characters will live with you forever...especially John Thorton and his love for Margaret.<br /><br />The acting was brilliant. I'd not heard of Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe prior to seeing them portraying the lead parts but Richard Armitage has snatched my love and affection for Mr. Darcy and made me fall utterly and devotedly in love with his Mr. Thornton.<br /><br />This DVD is a treasure that you will keep returning to time and time again.
0380789035|2.0|Here's the thing, I can tell in the first 50 pages whether or not a book is worth my time.  Two summers ago a friend recommended this and \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" for some literary research I was doing.  Despite my sneaking suspicion, I decided to commit to both of them.  The undertaking of this enterprise proved a disaster.  Here's the review of \\"American Gods\\"...<br /><br />\\"Shadow walked to the end of the boulevard.\\"<br /><br />\\"Shadow followed Mr. Wendesday.\\"<br /><br />\\"Shadow picked out clothes before returning home.\\"<br /><br />\\"Shadow does nothing until the last 50 pages of the book.\\"<br /><br />The protagonist lives up to his title.  If ambivalence is worse than hatred, then Shadow represents all that is wrong with the world.  Okay, that's a bit hyperbolic, but you get my point: Shadow is useless.  Unfortunately, so is \\"American Gods\\".<br /><br />When reading a book, I look for any of the following redeeming factors:<br /><br />1) Is the narrative prose artfully done?<br /><br />2) Are the ideas innovative?<br /><br />3) Is the story inspired?<br /><br />4) Are the characters interesting?<br /><br />5) Is the concept fresh?<br /><br />Any of these virtues will potentially redeem a book for me, no matter how awful it is.  Much to Neil Gaiman's discredit, he fails in all categories.  I only give him two stars because he employs HP Lovecraft's concept of \\"old gods\\" and \\"new gods\\" and the empowerment we bestow upon them through belief.  Don't believe me?  Read \\"Tales of HP Lovecraft\\" edited by Joyce Carol Oats and you'll see that most of these ideas were done better...70 years ago!  But I digress.  To be more specific:<br /><br />1) This is the biggest part of any novel to me, so it gets the numero uno spot.  I can excuse uninspired stories (\\"Moby Dick\\") or slightly wooden characters (\\"Gates of Fire\\") if the prose is elegant and masterfully put together.  But Gaiman's \\"Gods\\" is pretty flat and rote in its presentation.  We see things through Shadow's eyes as a series of tapestries that flow past.  There's no real revelation except what takes place in the moment and that's boring.  Too, Gaiman is no wordsmith.  Someone needs to clue him in to Dictionary.com so he can spice up the diction a little.<br /><br />2) Gaiman's ideas are (as I've already mentioned) borrowed from HP Lovecraft, as well as others.  It's not bad thing, writers do it all time (more so than you'd think), but it IS a bad thing when it's not improved upon.  As someone who has written novels about what takes place \\"behind the veil\\", I can tell you that his handling of gods (and their climactic battle especially) was fairly trite.  It wasn't handled badly, but there was little to no creative innovation, and in the end I didn't really care who was winning the fight, even after the twist.<br /><br />3) The story more or less follows one man's rebound life after his release from prison.  He has nothing, no one, nada and--much like the character \\"Nada\\" in \\"They Live!\\"--it takes him a while to start being proactive.  In fact, the whole novel is him following (his name is Shadow, remember) Mr. Wednesday as the haggard rogue runs around on these seemingly ambiguous errands.  This is all well and good until you get to the end and realize that not only does it not seem like a very creative plan, but whole chapters' worth of setup could have been avoided as they did nothing to further the story or the characters.<br /><br />4) Speaking of which, the characters are pretty flat here.  We have the obviously scurrilous drunk father figure, the loner without a soul, the sultry woman, and a whole bevy of characters that never move from their one note concertos.  If Gaiman's characters would simply do SOMETHING that contradicted themselves then it might be interesting.  That's what makes characters intriguing: their lack of predictability.  As such, whenever a character shows up, you more or less know right where they're headed...save one final sub-twist that is great but far too little too late.<br /><br />5) The concept is great.  I loved it.  Gods fighting each other over power and influence.  \\"This town ain't big enough for the both of us.\\"  Very cool concept.  Unfortunately Gaiman just didn't have enough creative ideas here to spice things up and give us something we hadn't seen before.<br /><br />The fact that this book one a Hugo both A) makes me sad for the state of sci-fi and genre fiction, and B) gives me hope that my works will easily garner recognition.  The bar is lowered.  Step up and raise it, please.<br /><br />If you want to read great macabre sci-fi/weird horror then buy \\"Tales of HP Lovecraft\\" (edited and compiled by Joyce Carol Oats).  If you want to read unparalleled prose check out anything by Steven Pressfield.  If it's bizarre, beautiful word pictures you're looking for then go with Milorad Pavic.  Or if characters are what you want, try anything by David Sedaris.  All of these surpass Gaiman's \\"American Gods\\".. <br /> <br />5) The concept is great.  I loved it.

Too bad it's mostly all lies. But to be honest, I don't think I'd believe everything in the book as truth if James Frey wasn't exposed.  <br />All in all, take it for what it is...an entertaining read. Although it'll hit home a couple of times and that's REAL.

0679642609|5.0|\\"Meditations\\" is a series of short writings by Marcus Aurelius, a Roman Emperor during the 2nd century, setting forth his ideas on Stoic philosophy.  Stoic philosophy has been popular with the Roman intellectual elites; it is likely that Aurelius had been tutored by Epictetus.      Marcus Aurelius was not an original thinker or a leader in the development of Stoic thought, and \\"The Meditations\\" are a series of quotations, varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs.  The original was written in Greek while Aurelius was campaigning sometime 170 and 180.  Aurelius was in his late 50s and early 60s by then, and the notes summarize a lifetime of experiences, emotions, and thoughts.  Meditations are collection of these short thoughts, brief ideas and quiet contemplations helping Aurelius in guidance and self-improvement.     The core point of Stoicism is the denial of emotion, a skill which, Marcus Aurelius says, will free a man from the pains and pleasures of the material world.  Aurelius often mentions the need to focus at the moment, to look for the beauty of the moment, and to seek the meaning of the moment.  He seeks to strip out the extraneous influences on existence by just pointing towards the important part of our lives: being.  Quite a Buddhist idea, in itself. Aurelius claims that the only way a man can be harmed by others is to allow his reaction to overpower him.  If you have a Zen Buddhist bent, reading Meditations will likely reveal the intellectual and spiritual similarities between these two different groups of thoughts.
0393316041|2.0|Coming from a 16 year old girl that has to read this book for a school project...I would have to say that this book is kind of boring. If your into physics and science and all that jazz then you will most likely enjoy this book. But if you're going to read it just to read it, then I would suggest you not. I have to admit, that some of the stuff Richard Feynman says is funny but I found my self skipping pages at a time because of its boringness.  Don't get me wrong, I really do admire Mr. Feynman as a man and he was a great physicist but this book was just ok. Sometimes he got into a lot of in-depth physics stuff that I just didn't care for. But sometimes i was interested in what he was saying.  <br /> <br />Have a nice day
B0000019PA|5.0|I must admit that the first time I listened to \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\", I utterly despised it. My best friend played it on his car very loud, and there they were, him and another buddy energetically singing to \\"Holland 1945\\", and me praying for the speakers to blow. Gosh that was a pain. Somehow, the songs remained in the back of my mind, and weeks later, I asked him to borrow me the album. That was in 2002, and nowadays, I still hold his copy with me, and I carry it wherever I go. There's no freaking way for me to ever get tired of \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\". It's too beautiful to bear, that I end up crying just to the thought of it most of the time. <br /> <br />What is it with this album that makes it so special, it will probaly remain a mistery forever. Jeff Mangum's off-key voice can turn annoying as hell, that's for sure. His lyrics on kings of carrot flowers and girls with roses in her eyes are as abstract and mind provoking as so is the majesty pretentions of its horns and orchestra-on-an-acid-trip arrangements. But songs like \\"King of Carrot Flower Pt. 1\\", \\"Two Headed Boy\\" or \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\" are concrete tales of introspective memories, skillfully relating every detail. The uncompromised feeling of its music and powerful imagery it can create on everyone who listen to it, only shows that Jeff Mangum is just an ordinary man who was able to find total freedom when expressing his art, and that could easily be the main credit for him. <br /> <br />If I could I'd give infinte stars to this album. I don't blame those who might not like it, perhaps all of us who cannot live without it think of it as an expression of ourselves: haunting, beautiful, and impossible to figure out. The passion and intensity in every second of its lenght is hard to find anywhere else in the music world. It's each one's call to determine whether \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\" is a messy approach to insanity, an acid trip gone awry, or the masterpiece of somedelusional music genius.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I don't know why I love Hugh Grant movies so much; is it because of Hugh or the movie he chooses to act in?  I have to say that this is one of the best even though it is a departure from his usual fare of romantic comedies.  All the same, we have another stellar performance.    Will Freeman is a shallow, self-absorbed man who is independently wealthy.   This affords him a life that is completely boring (although he doesn't know it yet)--one that he fills with 30 minute segments--watching game shows, buying records, getting his hair cut, etc.   He has discovered a new way to date women though--single mothers are the best because there are no strings attached.  This is fine with Will as he is not emotionally attached to anyone.......until Marcus.   <br /> <br />Marcus is the twelve year-old son of a chronically depressed suicidal hippie.  He is emotionally exhausted from trying to keep his mother happy (and alive) and finds a safe haven at Will's house.  For a while there is no talking, no sharing, just peace.  Eventually Will finds himself liking this misfit and tries to protect him from the school bullies.  Once our hero opens himself up to the possibility of caring for someone, other friendships and even love will follow.   <br /> <br />Besides being laugh out loud funny, this adorable film has all the elements that make it a great movie.  A sweet, poignant story, people we really care about (and Hugh Grant is quite handsome!) plus a wonderful happily ever after ending make this a fairy tale that I will watch again and again.
B00028HBKM|2.0|Beautifully acted and filmed (by the son of noted Holocaust denier Hutton Gibson), obviously made with \\"passion\\" for the (literal and figurative) self-flagellation crowd. After the poor guy gets the lash for the 114th time (yeah, I know it's only 39; it just seemed like 114), with all that red-dyed corn syrup splattering all over the place, it just starts to get a little silly, kind of like the flying entrails in ANDY WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN. Capital punishment is, of course, not very funny, especially when the punishment is Death By Torture, so I did my best not to laugh.<br /><br />If Evangelicals, Opus Dei Catholics, sadists and other moonbats want to go all swooney over this sort of thing, they are most welcome to. To the curious, but more sqeamish, of my fellow nonbelievers, I would not suggest watching this after a heavy meal. If you must do so, keep a bucket handy.
B000CBO9RW|5.0|After the superb masterpiece Pulp Fiction, came From Dusk Till Dawn (1995) which continued the genius Quentin Tarantinos consistent flair for startling origanality and diversity.<br /><br />This wild action-thriller sees two brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) venturing on a desperate crime spree across America. Tarantino puts in an effective and significantly amusing performance as the completely deranged convict who alongside the dynamic on-screen presence of George Clooney, kidnaps a preacher (played convincingly by Harvey Kietel of Reservoir Dogs fame) and his two children (which includes Juliette Lewis of Natural Born Killers fame).<br /><br />They flee with their hostages in tow to a remote and eerie nightclub in Mexico. Where as the film seems to be settling down as a compelling hostage drama, the film wildly steers direction and plunges into an enduring and darkly humorous horror movie as the nightclub is soon to be discovered to be crawling with blood-thirsty vampires.<br /><br />The outrageous plot twists shrewdly make From Dusk Till Dawn all the more compelling and riveting and the dialogue races along like a rollercoaster!<br /><br />The special effects are vastly impressive and the energetic filmmaking and engaging peformances from all the cast makes this truly another masterpiece to Tarantinos credit.
0375507256|4.0|Cloud Atlas is the first book I have read in a long time where I have finished and thought, \\"Wow, that was different.\\" It follows six people and their stories in different eras. The book spans time from the 1860s Pacific to a post apocalyptic earth where civilisation has to be rebuilt from scratch. In between you encounter a young musician in the 1930s, a 1970s journalistic detective story, a humerous \\"One flew over the cuckoos nest\\" tale, and a futuristic Korea where humans have become merely \\"consumers\\" and robots are their slaves. <br /> <br />David Mitchell has written a book that breaks boundaries of style and structure without being too abstract. This is not an \\"I have an Arts degree and I'm going to show it\\" type of book. It is readable first and foremost. The voices of the 6 characters are vastly different, showcasing the author's versatility. And there is a powerful theme about the nature of souls, power and what it means to be human and civilised.  <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say Cloud Atlas is a breezy read. It stimulates the mind, and probably wouldn't do well as a beach read. But if you want something to read that's original, doesn't degrade your intelligence and makes you think, then you should give it a go.
B000002LIM|5.0|For anyone with even a passing interest in film scores, or even music in general, this is must-own. Danny Elfman's score for Tim Burton's first (and best) Batman film is, in a word, magnificent. Inspired, memorable, and moving, Elfman's score is easily one of the greatest soundtracks in cinema history. Although fantastic if listened to alone, the way this music is used in the film itself elevates what is other-wise a very good movie into a great one. This score compliments the film so well, it's frightening. The main theme is a perfect reflection of Batman himself: it's majestic and powerful,yet tortured and dark. <br /> <br />This gothic, elegaic score is easily one of the finest soundtracks ever written, and stands as a testament to the power and importance music holds in the world of movies. You'd do yourself a tremendous service to buy this soundtrack, and at this price, you'd be hard pressed to find a reason not to.
B000E8N690|5.0|This movie is a wonderful story because it is strong on every component: <br /> <br />1.) Historic/Biographical Content: It gives you little dates and locations at various scenes so you can follow along and know what happens in which year. (very helpful). It also shows the death of his older brother, which causes him to suffer emotional heartache forever. It shows him singing in Folsom, which is my favorite scene. It shows him being addicted to, and overcoming, drugs. It shows him proposing to June several times. It shows lots of TRUE-TO-LIFE events in Johnny Cash's life. <br /> <br />2.) The Music: I have to say this is the BEST aspect of the movie. Not only did Reese and Joaquin actually sing all songs in the movie, they also played the instruments. Their voices and talents are phenomenal! They hit EVERY note, EVERY time...no errors. Go pick up the soundtrack! <br /> <br />3.) The Romance: You can tell, early in their friendship, that June and Johnny are attracted to one another. They cannot be together because of Johnny's wife and June's recent divorce. You can still see in the way they act, though, that they really do care for one another. I was sooo moved when they finally had sex. It was so sweet. Then, to see June help Johnny through his drug problems...that was the nicest aspect of their relationship, I think. In the end, when June finally accepts his proposal on stage and they kiss...I cried so hard. <br /> <br />4.) Appropriateness: While this film has some drug usage and language, I still found it appropriate for the entire family. There is no violence (with the exception of Johnny's outburst early in the film, backstage). There was no nudity. (They had sex, but it cuts from them kissing to them laying in bed the next morning.) While the film may not be appropriate for younger audiences...I would say anyone over the age of 11 or 12 could watch it with their parents and enjoy it. <br /> <br />GO...BUY...THIS...FILM...TODAY!
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|I would consider this one of the finest queer movies ever made. Never does Transamerica fail to resonate with a wide variety of emotions - anger, joy, loneliness, and loss -- yet the plot never sags from too much feeling. If anything, the movie happens quickly and the movie deserves a second viewing soon after to catch things that might have been missed. <br /> <br />The actors are top notch and give their best performances to date. The subject matter is treated with the respect it deserves.
B000E1YVZU|2.0|Okay, full confession up front: I have never seen the Broadway musical on which this film is based, but I have walked by the Nederlander theatre where it plays and seen the lobby tricked out like some Epcot Center approximation of the \\"actual\\" Lower East Side of Manhattan, where both play and film are supposed to be set.  I have, however, seen well north of a thousand films, including more than a few musicals, some of which I actually enjoyed, so I do think I can give \\"Rent,\\" the movie, a fair shake as a reviewer.  That said, what I did see was a phony and hollow co-opting the very counterculture that \\"Rent\\" pretends to celebrate.<br /><br />Just as \\"Hair\\" (play & film) was a vision of what total squares saw of the 60's counterculture, \\"Rent\\" updates that vision to 1989, where there was indeed a thriving artistic community in the Lower East Side, one that even produced some interesting results.  Of course, \\"Rent\\" is also a (very) loose adaptation of Puccini's opera \\"La Boheme\\" (if Puccini were alive today he would roll over in his grave--LOL) so composer Jonathen Larsen had no responsibility to get his setting just right.  That he managed to get so much so wrong is another matter.  Or should I say sanitized?  Or cartoon-ified, if that makes any sense.  The songs and music, which have been hailed as the closest the American theatre has ever come to actual rock music, turns out to be mainly sappy power ballads ready-made for a particularly \\"rebellious\\" American Idol contestant.  One song that attempts to be what I think was indended as rap is so embarrassing that even Vanilla Ice seems hardcore by comparison.  The clothes the characters wear are the types of outfits that would get them laughed at by even  the leather/safety pin/mohawk trust fund punks who beg for change on St. Marks Place.  Okay, in one scene Idina Menzel's Maureen does a bit of \\"performance art\\" that's every bit as excruciating (albeit PG-13 sanitized) as the real thing.  Problem is, I think it wasn't intended to seem that way! It should also be noted that most of the cast, who originated their roles in the musical's first run, now seem way too old for their characters, and the effect is more midlife crisis than downtown cool.<br /><br />In the showstopping set piece anthem \\"La Vie Boheme\\" the thinly drawn characters dance around a faux-authentic Lower East Side pub and name check edgy artists that range from Alan Ginsberg and John Cage to Susan Sontag and The Sex Pistols.  needless to say, a movie shepherded by \\"Home Alone\\"/\\"Harry Potter\\" helmer Chris Columbus is about as \\"edgy\\" as a nerf ball.  \\"Rent\\" tries to sell us prepackaged rebellion as just a bunch of lovable eccentrics (with few eccentricities to speak of) and doomed romantics, most of whom, we are to believe suffer from (oh excuse me--are \\"surviving with\\") AIDS.  In this movie, the worst symptom of the disease is apparently to look kind of run-down and tired, but not too tired to belt out a heart-tugging ballad or two.  This watering-down of a very real pandemic is more offensive than any of the supposedely \\"shocking\\" behavior any of our Bohemian heroes are supposed to delight in.  Frankly, I couldn't stop thinking of the skewering \\"Rent\\" took in the film \\"Team America: World Police\\"--\\"Everyone has AIDS!\\"  Indeed.<br /><br />I will grant that there are a couple of effective numbers that recall--I believe on purpose--Brecht and Weill, and as a whole the cast has energy to spare and obviously have learned from experience to play off each other very well.  I also dug the cameo by Sarah Silverman as an oily TV executive, but then I'm a sucker for Ms. Silverman in general.  A few bright spots, however, cannot rescue this muddled morass of mediocrity.  Since I've been prattling on now for what seems like 525,600 minutes, if you still think you really have to see this, the title suggests how you should go about it.  I know I've garnered a few \\"not helpful\\" votes from fans of the play/movie, to those just curious let me say: be wary.  Be very, very wary.just curious let me say: be wary.  Be very, very wary.
B00005JOEA|4.0|I am very particular when I buy DVD's for my collection. \\"V for Vendetta\\" is a movie I will be glad to own. It was almost completely true to the original graphic novel, and it wasn't ruined with the inclusion of some Hollywood pretty boy to ruin the overall plot.
B000025XX0|5.0|This album showcases Queen's greatest hits from 1981 to 1991.<br /><br />While I prefer 70's Queen to 80's Queen , there are nonetheless some real gems here like the catchy A Kind Of Magic , the mesmerizing Under Pressure (A collaboration with David Bowie) , the rythmic Radio GaGa , the anthemic I Want It All , the rockish  I Want To Break Free , the rock opera It's A Hard Life , the mournful Who Wants To Live Forever , the high energy The Invisible Man , the funky Hammer To Fall and the poerful One Vision .<br /><br />Together with the UK Geatest Hits I you get a great introduction to one of the 20th centuries greatest bands.
078322611X|5.0|I lost my Father Bob almost 11 years ago and my life changed forever.  Every time I see this film, I think about my regrets, my past, and my Father.  I cry every single time I see this great American classic film.  I always feel better at the end of the film.  As an aspiring Screenwriter, I urge everyone who has lost a parent or love baseball or love film, to own this film.  Learn from it and learn that perhaps dreams can come true.  And perhaps Heaven is somewhere in Iowa...<br /><br />-Mark McLaughlin, marknetproductions.dyndns.ws
0767822617|1.0|When I saw the plot somewhere of The Way We Were, I thought that would be a gorgeous story and make a beautiful film. Many people have college loves and would enjoy meeting them in the future, if only to remember when we were young and innocent and in love. Once upon a time I was like Kate, and I loved a boy who was also a writer, like myself. <br /> <br />Sadly, this film lacks emotion. Perhaps if a woman had written and directed it, there might have been more connection between Kate and Hubble. Personally I felt like they never felt very passionate about each other. Sure, he liked her because she was outgoing and not a decoration like his college sweetheart and her friends. Kate liked Hubble's all American good looks. But they never had any passion. They never seemed to be talking together about anything! <br /> <br />They never shared anything to make a lasting relationship. I guess that's why they broke up in the end. Perhaps the message was not only that they were too different, but they really had no substance to be together. It was all illusion.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I happen to love magical realism and Chocolat offers a fine serving of this gentle area of speculative cinema. A fantasy that involves the celebration of family and love first and foremost as well as champions self-expression and joy for living. <br /> <br />The actors all do tremendous work making the magic come alive. I cannot decide who amongst them is my favorite. They seem like real people, struggling to understand life, burdened by it, and yet wanting to find the means to laugh and play like children. The final scene is wonderful. <br /> <br />And the chocolate! I'm really not a huge eater of it in real life, but I cannot help but want to nibble on every dish featured in the film.
1400079179|5.0|Dan Brown brings back Robert Langdon (Angles and Demons) in his roll as the great symbologist to unravel an ancient mystery. The book is a fast paced ride through Europe and the mystery of history that is really enjoyable. It is remarkable to me how so many people have taken this work of FICTION so literally and shamelessly exploited the masses to enrich themselves; the books on the market that are supposed to \\"debunk\\" this work of FICTION are too numerous to count.<br /><br />If you like great fiction and a fast paced well written story then take off your literalist TRUTH hat and enjoy a wild ride with Langdon and the other characters in this great book. As a biblical scholar I highly recommend this work it has elements of truth, that come out of myth, and is as I stated, very entertaining.
B000024A70|5.0|The original Queen Greatest hits album , first released in 1981 , this was the album that first got me hooked on Queen when I was 12.<br />It includes all of Queen's top 20 hits between 1974 and 1980.<br />Personal favourites include:<br />The classic rock opera masterpiece Bohemian Rhapsody (1975)<br />The debonair Killer Queen (1974)<br />The rollicking Fat Bottomed Girls (1978)<br />The laidback You're My Best Friend (1975)<br />The glam rock Seven Seas of Rhye (1974)<br />The funky Don't Stop Me Now (1978)<br />The hypnotic Somebody To Love (1976)<br />and the whimsical  Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy (1976)<br /><br />Songs that should have been included are Keep Yourself Alive (1973)<br />Doin Allright (1973)<br />and<br />39 (1975).<br />Still the best of Queen's compilation albums.<br />If you haven't seriously explored Queen's earlier work this is a good place to start and should get you hooked on all their albums from the 1974 to 1980 period.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This movie has a lot of what I like: interesting European scenery, an involving storyline of a man being pursued throughout the film; fun action scenes and very little profanity. Plus, some great actors.     It helps to know the first movie in which the \\"hero\\" is an ex-CIA agent who, having lost his memory, doesn't recall who he is and why he is being hunted down by friend and foe alike. There are a few great car chases scenes in here but some of the other action stretches credibility as there is no way \\"Bourne\\" could elude his captors as he did several times here...but it's fun to watch anyway.    The herky-jerky camera style may put some viewers off watching this DVD but after I adjusted to it, I didn't mind. It kind of added to the hectic pace of the story.    Matt Damon is very good in the lead and Brian Cox is an effective \\"bad guy,\\" easy to dislike. Karl Urban, a new face at the time, also is interesting as the Russian hit man, even though he has only a few lines. The is one of the few films ever to have Moscow as one of the location sites. In fact, this Bourne two-part series so far is a like attravelogue. Here in the sequel, we see India, Italy, Germany and Russia.    Of the three Bourne movies, this is my favorite and I'm hoping that soon it will be available separately on Blu-Ray.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|On the recommendation of a friend, I picked up Stephen Chow's \\"Kung-Fu Hustle\\" -- \\"It's a martial arts comedy,\\" he said.  He may have committed the worst case of under-selling a product I've ever come across. <br /> <br />\\"Kung-Fu Hustle\\" contains the most surprising, you'll-never-see-this-coming humor I've seen in a movie since I saw Steve Buscemi's leg (with sock) meeting its destiny in a woodchipper in the Coen brothers' \\"Fargo.\\"  I will be brief, so as not to spoil any of the surprises for you, but without giving too much away, you will see subtle and not-so-subtle references to such moments as Sean Connery's death scene in \\"The Untouchables,\\" the \\"hallway of blood\\" from \\"The Shining,\\" the fight scenes from \\"The Matrix,\\" and the Roadrunner versus Wile E. Coyote.   <br /> <br />Some movies, such as Stanley Tucci's \\"Big Night,\\" just make you smile with their tone and general warmth.  I never thought I'd say that about a martial arts film, but from the moment the Axe Gang shows up in \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" apparel, kills a few gangsters, and then dances some fantastic mish-mash step/line dancing, I was enthralled with \\"Kung Fu Hustle.\\"  Also, who can't love a movie mainly set in \\"Pig Sty Alley,\\" ruled by the Landlady, a witty spoof of all \\"dragon lady\\" stereotypes.   <br /> <br />Avoid all reviews and spoilers for this movie -- while I expect \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" will hold up on repeated viewings, I will never again be as surprised or thrilled as I was the first time I saw it.  A wonderful addition to the film library.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|after finishing my 10th BBT view, I was so outrageous that I couldn't do anything else except to write down my anger so I can get over it. At the end of the movie, I cried out loud as hard as ever before. I just cannot stand the loss of such a beautiful love, the death of a human being for his strong love toward another being, and the mere existence of another being with the stark realization of what could have been. My tear poured out when I imagined the last day of any real Ennis who has experienced such a life. He probably closed his eyes with smile on the his face and woke up again as a 19 years old , young and without fear, on the moutain, among the meadow, Jack was laying beside him and bitching loudly what took you so long? Jack as he had always been: doey eyes and boyish smile, smoke on one hand and whiskey on the other ..... <br /> <br />As a straight woman, my heart goes out to any real Ennis. What makes this society a hell to live that love like this can ony exist in the aftelive? Why somebody has the privilege to judge the right and wrong and threaten other people lives for again these made-up rules? Why? Everyone can only live their life once, aren't they entitled to choose the love of their life as?  <br /> <br />Whever I work up at night in the past one month after my 1st reviewing, the blood-stained shirts popped up in my head,  and I cried for my old me, a biggot holding strong to the social rules. Thank you, heath, jack, ang, I have changed to be a better person.  <br /> <br />I do see splint of light at the end of the movie though. Fully aware of the presence of Alma, who knew the secret of Ennis and Jack, Ennis would attend his daughter's wedding. Finally, he was proud of the love Jack gave him. Jack's soul would have found peace from that moment.
B00005JOQ9|5.0|This movie shows the sickness of the rich people and their bestiality. Shows that they 're always <br />doing anything they want to satisfy their sickness, with the power of money without consequences.  <br /> <br />The movie shows that corruption rules everywhere without exceptions.... <br /> <br />The similarity of images are incredible! At start  i.e the whorehouse @ Amsterdam  with the cenral hall and the  <br />rooms on both sides, had similar characteristics with the slaughter @ Bratislava. The only  <br />difference its just in the \\"pleasure\\" level.  <br /> <br />I think the conclusion has a deeper meaning. The prostitution in Amsterdam (and in general)  <br />in the most of cases, hides definitely a form of slavery. The movie just shows something like that  <br />on a \\"higher\\" level.  <br /> <br />Just remember the many cases of worker girls @ North Mexico who they re working on the factories <br />and witch they have abducted from the big bosses (of course they 're drug dealers, coca producers) who they rule all the local authorities, army and government.  <br />When a woman on a N. Mexico abducted, the dissapearance holds a few days and then the police locates <br />these girls dead in a terrible condition (of course precedes a heavy torture before they die).  <br /> <br />TO ALL POSITIVE THINK PEOPLE:  <br />Think the deeper meaning of this movie. It stamps our \\"culture\\" and our \\"progress\\" as a human beigns....
B00001U0DP|5.0|What a movie. Never in 58 years have I stopped a film because of being so deeply moved and saddened myself that I felt I needed to mentally prepare to consider finishing the film another day. I did. Although I rarely buy videos, this is one I'll add to my small collection. Inspiring.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I was drawn to purchase this soundtrack, from the influence of another powerful movie/soundtrack - Memoirs of a Geisha. I just only recently saw Memoirs and was touched by the beauty and the feelings the film evoked. The Last Samurai also starred the amazing Ken Watanabe, as did Memoirs, and though the roles in each movie were very different, I found his gentle spirit and passion were what touched me so deeply about both of these movies. I've watched the movie The Last Samurai several times and it always moves me to tears as he draws his last breath on the battlefield, whispering \\"they're all perfect...\\" those who have seen the movie will know what he's talking about.  <br />This movie soundtrack is beautiful, captivating and passionately emotional and moving. Though it's been some time since I've viewed my dvd of The Last Samurai, the musical score could quickly take me back to the film and hold me there. I recommend this soundtrack. Zimmer did an outstanding job of capturing the passion and discipline of this movie and the message of the Samurai. After watching this film, I had profound respect for the Samurai. I can't say enough good about this film or the soundtrack. And Tom Cruise wasn't even my draw to seeing the film in the first place.. Not even close... <br /> <br />The real star of the film was Mr Watanabe...
B00005JOFQ|1.0|After all the hype over this movie, I was expecting something great.  What a disappointment!!!  I found myself fast-forwarding through parts because it was soooo boring.  The story was mediocre, and the acting wasn't much better.  Really, after the sex scene, I was so ready to be done with this movie. It came across as violent, and that left me queasy (and FYI, if it had been a man and woman in the exact same scene, it would have bothered me just as much). <br /> <br />Save your money...not worth it.

0345347951|5.0|Personally, this Amazon.com reviewer thinks this is the best of all the Arthur C. Clarke books.  Why?  The human race sees its end and creatures that assist that end look like the devil.    One reviewer says that Humans (modern example:  the middle east) would keep on fighting if superior aliens came to earth.  Perhaps.  However, the story works and is believable.    The lite plot of the story is Aliens come to Earth and bring peace.  There is a golden period on Earth.  In a way the book reads quite like the old Twilight episode \\"To Serve Man\\".  Most readers expect the book to continue in that direction.  However, the book does not go in the direction you expect.  The Aliens are after your kids.      I have to admit I liked how Clark handled how that was done.  The human race just quits caring after all the children are taken away.  And most people would act like that.  Note, the kids are not kidnapped.  When they are taken away the children are quite alien by that time.  The children are not at all a devil type alien, they are of an Alien mind.  The Overmind wants the children of Earth.  The children have evolved past being human and are becoming a collective mind.      This book has three parts.  The first part deals with the aliens coming to earth.  The second part deals with living with the aliens and the effects of their visits.  The third part of the book is what I call end-game.  It's very Alien.  A human visits the home world of the Aliens, is told by the Aliens that the Human fascination with the occult nearly got it exterminated by other worried worlds, and then the final human watches the transformation of the human race.    If you read and like this book it destroys the thinking of the friendly alien visiting Earth.  If a space fairing race comes here it's because they want something or someone.      This excellent Sci-Fiction is Five Stars and this should be made into a Sci-Fi channel movie.

B0001I561E|5.0|While Disney's early animated films were seen as masterpieces (Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan), there was a long time when Disney's animated features were met with mediocre box office receipts.  After The Sword in the Stone, The Black Cauldron, and Oliver and Company (I'm not saying they're bad, just poorly received in theaters), there was a Rennaissance or second coming of Disney films.  Starting with The Little Mermaid and going on to Beauty and the Beast (which remains the only animated film to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and probably the only one ever due to the creation of the Best Animated Feature category), Aladdin came soon after. <br />Telling the story of the poor young boy who found a genie and got three wishes, Aladdin is a first for most animated films, due to its inclusion of pop culture references (more on that later). <br />Aladdin is a young thief living in the fictional Agrabah (the tale took place in medieval Baghdad, but due to the Gulf War, this detail was changed).  He and his partner-in-crime Abu (who is a monkey) must steal in order to survive, but in doing so must avoid the royal guards who police the marketplace.  One day, he runs into a woman who is about to lose her hand for stealing an apple and giving it to a young child who is starving.  He saves her and takes her to his home to hide from the law.  It turns out that the girl is really Jasmine, the daughter of the Sultan.  She ran away from the palace in order to see what life outside the walls was really like.  The Sultan needs to marry her off to a prince (the law dictates that she must marry a prince, and she must be married by a given birthday).  She is taken back to the palace, and Aladdin is arrested for \\"kidnapping\\" the princess. <br />Little do either of them know that Jafar, the Sutan's vizier, is plotting against the Sultan and hopes to get his hands on a lamp which houses a genie.  He needs a \\"diamond in the rough\\" in order to enter the Cave of Wonders and retrieve the lamp, and when he learns that Aladdin is the boy he's looking for, he has the guards sieze him (which happened when he was with Jasmine).  Though he tells Jasmine that Aladdin has been beheaded for his crimes, he later disguises himself as a prisoner and helps Aladdin get out of the cell.  He brings Aladdin to the cave and tells him that, in exchange for the lamp, Aladdin will receive a reward beyond his wildest dreams.  Though, due to Abu's greed, Aladdin and Abu get trapped in the cave along with the lamp and a magic flying carpet.  Aladdin accidentally releases the Genie of the lamp, who promises him three wishes and a way out of the cave.  This is where the pop culture references begin.  The Genie (who is expertly voiced by Robin Williams) spouts off references, impressions, and jokes at a mile a minute (my favorite of which being a Jack Nicholson impression).  He does Ed Sullivan, Pinnochio, Arnold Schwarzenneger, and numerous others. <br />Anyway, from there, Aladdin wishes to become a prince so that he can marry Jasmine.  Little does he know that Jasmine has no interest in marrying a prince, despite what the law dictates.  At first, she is upset that yet another vapid prince has come to win her, but he eventually wins her over by taking her on a ride on his carpet across the world (it wins her too quickly to seem real, but it will have to work due to pacing issues).  After that, she agrees to marry him.  This leads Aladdin to reconsider his promise to free the Genie with his third wish, because he fears that he will need his services and help in the future.  Meanwhile Jafar tries to find a way to get rid of Aladdin, and eventually he steals the lamp away, turning Agrabah into hell on Earth. <br />While there may not have been any twists (it was fairly by-the-numbers), Aladdin is a very enjoyable movie.  The animation is great (while not as revolutionary as it was back in 1992, it is still good), and the songs are some of Disney's best, especially A Whole New World.  Furthermore, it can serve as an interesting study in freedom for older viewers.  Being free and feelings of confinement/imprisonment was a major theme throughout the movie.  And even if the older viewers don't like film analysis, there is still a lot there to enjoy. <br />Aladdin is a great example of how a kids' movie can be for everyone (maybe not as good an example as The Incredibles).  It is fun, funny, and very well done overall.
B00000DQSV|5.0|England's Fab Five strike back with a potent album that silences the haters.  Just because they lost two members, it doesn't mean these guys can't rock.  I'm lovin' every minute of \\"Notorious\\"!

B000068PQ0|2.0|Most of this album just feels like left overs from the soft bulletin record to me.  There is a few decent tracks on this album but nothing really notable.  Alot of random studio effects and alot of [...] that just sounds like filler.  The Soft Bulletin is far and away a better record along with most of all the previous Flaming Lips albums.  If you are new to the Lips I highly suggest starting somewhere else.
B00016ZQXE|1.0|Even though this is Queen's best-selling album (just 4,000 copies sold), it was NO match for the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, which is the best-selling album before Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller!\\"  Ignore classic rock nerds and chart geeks who will say otherwise.  This album, by all accounts, is bad.  Thanks.
B00005O438|5.0|Yeah this movie was made in the vicinity of my town.  It starts out slow but gets good even though she can't get her dang kid to shut up.  The best parts of the movie are the stranded in the car parts.  I love it when she finally gets tuff and kicks Cujo's ass.   <br /> <br />I hate the cover art of the Dvd it is ridiculous.  Cujo the dog was much more gory, bloody, and evil looking not all cross eyed and cartoony looking...
B000AMWIVM|1.0|A pointless plot, bad acting and the typical Hollywood formula for teeny-bopper horror movies. The ending made the movie go from crap to MAJOR crap. This movie is very scary and disturbing - for 3rd graders....     <br />You want disturbing?   You want to be freaked out for weeks after a movie?  Try out some of the best, most disturbing work anywhere - look up director Takashi Miike on Amazon, then try out Audition, Gozu, Ichi, etc. <br />But for all those who thought SAW was scary and disturbing, then forget it - you couldn't handle Miike.  Try Sesame Street. <br /> <br />
0767802470|5.0|This, along with \\"Downfall\\", is probably the finest WWII-based film that is not told from the American perspective. The stories told from the small and filthy submarine send a wide variety of emotions through your head and stick to your brain like super glue. The pacing is just right: it really makes you feel that you were there in the tedious Atlantic Ocean. The music is brilliant, and the visual effects still look realistic, even though they are seen as miniature props. Great performances all around, a few action here and there, and high levels of drama, comedy, and suspense makes this one a real good winner.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie is the touchstone for those of us who had our own brokeback Mountains sometime in our lives.<br /><br />I had my Brokeback Mountain when I turned 16 in the outskirts of Pocatello, Idaho.  There are things you know, things you do not want to know, and things you force from yourself like the plague, lest the truth peeks out and you then face the fact that you just might be \\"one of them.\\"<br /><br />Southeastern Idaho in 1970 was not much different than Wyoming in 1963.  In a Mormon dominated country culture, roles are die-cast, and anything divergant was an abomination.  In the \\"Jack\\" Mormon culture of bars, railroading and redneck cutter racing, there were \\"Us,\\" \\"The Hippies,\\" and of course, there were \\"Them.\\"  And noone in their right mind would ever want to be concieved as \\"one of them.\\"<br /><br />Yet there were those of us who lived the Ennis del-Mar and Jack Twist story.  It was \\"us\\" who suffered through all the unwritten rules, mores, and bigotries of the culture who portrayed a gun slinging John Wayne as the acme of \\"what a man should be.\\"  Stereotypes abounded on what \\"they\\" were and how \\"they\\" acted and \\"behaved.\\"  Brokeback mountain shatters these perceived stereotypes.  We, as Jack and Ennis learned early to fight what came natural to us, as we strove to fit in, keep silent and deny what was really going on in our minds and hearts.<br /><br />The real tragedy is that we became little more than robots, and although we fooled ourselves into believing we were straight, we were really little more than jointed wooden images in our traditional marriages.  See how both Jack and Ennis act so wooden in their marraiges and how they come to life only in each others arms, and you will see what I mean.<br /><br />If only I could once again meet Terry on my Brokeback Mountain, after 35 years have past!  Today I would have the guts to do what I couldnt do back then: Look him in the eyes and tell him what I REALLY felt.<br /><br />After surviving the Atomic Wars of divorce, estrangement by immediate family, I got my reward.  I am LIVING my own Brokeback Mountain in Washington State with my beloved Eddie.  So in reality, Ed and I are LIVING what Jack or Ennis could never live!<br /><br />Bravo for bringing to light the \\"Love that Dare Not say it's Name!\\"e Atomic Wars of divorce, estrangement by immediate family, I got my reward.  I am LIVING my own Brokeback Mountain in Washington State with my beloved Eddie.  So in reality, Ed and I are LIVING what Jack or Ennis could never live! <br /> <br />Bravo for bringing to light the \\"Love that Dare Not say it's Name!\\"
074322454X|5.0|Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers is a wonderfully written book. It is easy to pick up and hard to put down. I watched the HBO mini-series before reading this book and so much of this book was new for me, expanding on many aspects of the series. If you can't get enough of the series, read the book because it truly is more. There are more characters, battles, and sideplots. I've read this book twice and am considering reading it again very soon. Experience the real life saga of the men of Easy Company, 506th Reg, 101st Airborne. It is the best war book I've ever read. Thanks for reading.
