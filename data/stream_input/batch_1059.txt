0316069485|4.0|Reversal is well written and hooks you in. Michael Connelly does a great job as usual.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|Beautifully interpreted by Sinatra. So soft and mellow music I do not get tired of here it over and over.If you likes Sinatras music, you will love this CD.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I love this when I was a teen and I loved watching it all again now! Jared Leto is amazing, I've always loved Clair Danes. The rest of the cast are all real and pretty blunt. It touches bases on all different types of people in High School. Its not something with alot of comedy or drama. Its things that can really happen without over doing it. I loved it so much, I could watch it seriously everyday, I wish they would of had more seasons!
0061729078|2.0|What you have here is Aldous Huxley describing his experiments with Mescaline and musing on psychedelics. Maybe its his background (he came from a high level British aristocratic family) but he just comes off in such a cold detached way in his thoughts on psychedelics being an enhancement of ones spiritual life. Not that I don't believe psychedelics can't be a spiritual enhancer or give one a deep glance into ones self or into other worlds but Huxley just does it in such a sterile heartless way I didn't get much out of this book. I loved Brave New World but this is a very overrated book.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|Spoiler!  I would've given SATC2 4.5 stars had that been an option.  I rounded up to 5 to try to offset some of the awful ratings.  True, it wasn't as good as the first; it was just different.  I really liked the scenery and locale, seeing Aidan again, and I am a total sucker for a happy ending.  I watched the last 6 minutes at least a few times.  The whole scene with Big and Carrie after she returned was very well-written.  I just love him.  (As someone else said in their review, I appreciated that Big was a good guy this time and how he and Carrie decided not to have kids.)  I thought that the way they wrapped up the series was great!
B000EQ5TSI|4.0|To me, this is the best M:IP movie. Great action and the story is great too. John Woo directed this so of course the action is very stylistic and cool. I think people will and have enjoyed this film
0553804367|4.0|The title says it all and is probably the best summary of this exciting and entirely accessible popular physics book. A BRIEFER HISTORY OF TIME is both an update on and a more succinct, briefer version of Hawking's best-selling original work, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME. In a whirlwind review of man's scientific exploration of the working of the universe, Hawking and his co-author Mlodinow summarize our knowledge of the evolution of the universe from its earliest beginnings to today and bring a curious reader up to date on the state of the theories that, for now at least, best describe such complex, mystifying cosmological material as dark matter, black holes, worm holes, the difficulties of combining quantum mechanics and general relativity into a single mathematical formulation, string theory and even the possibility, however remote, of time travel.<br /><br />It's simply a given that someone who is interested in physics would find such material interesting and exciting. So it remains only to say that the achievement in writing such a fine book is to make the material accessible to mere mortal readers whose intellect simply can't compete with the likes of Stephen Hawking. With a wonderful combination of text and enlightening accompanying illustrations, A BRIEFER HISTORY OF TIME easily clears that standard and deserves a place in any interested reader's popular science library.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weiss
B00004STUL|4.0|This is truely what action movies are about. Classic movie in my opinion. This was Michael Bay's 1st film, he didnt go all crazy with explosives like he do now. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence an the perfect team. Enjoy!
B000001GQC|5.0|The short story is that this is an extremely well filled disc (almost 79 minutes) of remarkable performances of some of the most colorful, fabulous and atmospheric music ever written. Alexander Nevsky is a virtual tour de force in this performance, with an ice battle scene that is as spectacular as one could possibly dream of. The brass is blistering, the chorus smoldering (even if some might conceivably miss the \\"Russian sound\\" of some other recordings) the strings savage (yet precise) and the woodwinds, well, as magical as they are throughout the disc. It has, in short, all the flair and power you could dream of, even though introspective reflection is sacrificed at certain points (the Svetlanov, say, is more roughly pugnacious in the battle scene, but shorter still than Abbado on thrill and electrifying power and drama) - even so, the \\"field of the dead\\" is as harrowingly bleak as on any recording.     The remarkable Scythian suite, on the other hand, is more glittering, spectacularly atmospheric and vivid than savage, even though the energy is red-hot and it is full of swagger and style. The Lieutenant Kije suite is wonderfully wistful, with all the nobility, colors and character it could possibly require. There is less humor here, perhaps, than on some versions, but for its coloration I'd still pick Abbado's version as the top choice. The sound quality is splendid - wide-ranging and powerful in Nevsky, exceptionally vivid in the Scythian suite and warmly atmospheric in Kije. Urgently recommended.
B004A8EI9M|4.0|Long live the slow zombie that moves in herds. I'm loving the return to the Romero zombie (though 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead's fast zombies are some of my favs as well). As for this episode, I initially thought there was a bit too much set up early on in the episode but the final 15 mins of this show really built on that slow exposition. I'm looking forward to seeing what the season has in store for us. Also, not a review of the episode, but I really love buying just the shows I want to see using Amazon. This is my second purchase of a season of one of AMC's stellar original programming pieces (first purchase was mad men). I don't miss cable a bit.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I fricking love this show. So does my whole family I am a 27 yr old female with fiftyish parent and a 19 yr old sister. We all love this show perfect for marthon watching. Sometimes you just can't stop watching.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I had orderd this for my son to view while I was out of town, as a gift. I ordered it over a week before I left, yet it got here about 3 weeks after I returned. It did finally get here by the window they said, however not fast enough for me.    Movie was ok.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|This movie is only for true movie goers.... I cant recommend this to my friends and family because i think they would be too disturbed!!.. You have to watch this movie to the very end. I loved it though.. Oldboy is just one of those movies that you will remember for the rest of you life, and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was a fight scene that was way too long and really not necessary but the rest of the movie was awesome.  I would call this movie an ultimate revenge.  There is no better way to get even!!! twisted
B003TVMIDO|5.0|Got it in the mail on Lennon's 70th birthday anniversary...love the design and content, of course.  Good offer on Amazon..
B00406UK7S|5.0|(Written By Metalhead Ted-Karyn's Mate)  There is a reason the Romans built Hadrian's Wall...To keep the Picts away! What is Scotland today was Northern Brittania back then. This was the land of the Picts and they were the ones that were able to keep the Romans  from conquering Scotland. This story takes place long before Braveheart,( 177 A.D. )and is a worthy competitor.  Dominic West is great as usual as General Virilus, Michael Fassbender is fabulous as the lead, Quintus Dias.   Special mention goes to Olga Kurylenko, the avenging angel of the film. She steals each scene with her ferocity  and even haunts Dias in his dreams.     I can think of only a few great adventure films which take place in a harsh, ancient land, with barbaric war scenes, beautiful women, and the quest for revenge...Conan, Excalibur, Braveheart...It's time to add CENTURION to the list. Director Neil Marshall also wrote the script which is based on the almost 2,000 year old legend. The action moves rapidly and we are literally swept away into this film. Every dollar(pound)is up there on the screen.   The direction is awesome, the actors are outstanding, and there is even time for a little humor mixed in with the fireballs and battle axes.     Several reviewers commented on how gory it is. The film is very brutal( As the Romans were)and it's not for the kids or the fainthearted. There are throat slashings, beheadings, amputations and flaming arrows into the back of the head...And that's just the first 20 minutes!     You will be entertained completely. Yes, it's epic filmaking at its best. It is shot on location in Scotland and   England, also using the famous Pinewood Studios. Tour-de-Force moviemaking the way they used to make them. Alot of the land up there is still undeveloped and prestine. This makes for goregous locations and realistic storytelling.    \\"The Picts are relentless trackers. They can ride for days, hardly eating or sleeping. They just never stop coming.\\"  Our storyteller narrates about his sworn enemy. You end up cheering for both sides at first, as you understand that  the Picts were defending their land from foreign invaders. We end up admiring the Romans bravery and comraderie at the end and we're not disapointed at the film's climax.     I threw this into the DVD player and cranked up the digital sound the day it arrived in the mail from Amazon.   Just an outstanding and rousing adventure from beginning to end with a touch of romance for the ladies.
0316098337|1.0|Reviews I read in newspapers and magazines when this book was first published all insisted that 'Room' is not a gratuitous, cheap exploitation of the recent high profile, horrific cases.   What nonsense - the novel is gratuitous and heavily reliant on the reader's fascinated horror and knowledge of the real cases.      These reviews also emphasised the cleverness of the author in presenting events from the child's perspective rather than the woman's. That should have warned me - novels told from a child's perspective are often sentimental, and - unless very skilfully handled - often uneven and inept in their perspective as this novel is.    I also found key elements in the plot to be rediculous - the escape is beyond all credibility - and the characters are stereotypes and caricatures.  I feel quite ashamed that I read this book - I feel as though I am disrespectful to those real women and their children who endured this ordeal.
B0043KFA8U|5.0|I agree with the other reviewer that the album \\"grows on you\\". Most musicologists know Clapton's early start as a teen guitarist began under the mentorship of John Mayall and the Blues Breakers (I was a college student then). Naturally they parted ways and Mayall 70s tastes moved towards a jazz blues fusion whereas Clapton embraced rock with all his might (best heard live onstage in the 60s and 90s). When I first heard this new album I thought I was hearing Mayall's decades earlier crossover sounds born again. This is not a criticism just a pleasing recognition of his roots and better late than never.
0439023483|5.0|I had to download the next book to start listening to it right away after reading this.  Great story with many different layers.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The headphones are great for mobility, excellent sound quality, incredible wireless range and they block out 90% of external noise.  The only gripe i have with them is they seem a tad too tight.  I have a large head and after an hour of wearing them, I get the sensation of them digging into my head/temples.  If they had a someway of releasing the tension to adjust to different head sizes, they would be perfect or maybe change the outer foam around the earphones for better comfort.    Another issue I have is the side mounted hot keys, g1-g3, have the option to bind 'push to talk' with Ventrilo.  This allows the user to walk away from his/her computer and have an alt. push to talk key.  This feature is currently broken with Win7 and the latest versions of the Logitech software and Ventrilo software.    Battery life says 10 hours, but I'll put it more realistically at 5-6.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I purchased this mic on a recommendation \\"The $200 HD Studio\\" as a plug in for my Kodak Zi8. The sound is fine but the volume is horrible. I have made recordings with the camera's input volume set all the way up, and when I imported my videos to my Imac into IMovie, I have to select the volume and put that up to %170. Still when I save the video and try to play it, I have to turn my computer volume all the way up. What a pain in the butt, this has been because now I need to purchase a new/better mic and re-shoot all of my videos. Save your money and purchase a better Mic.
B003TJ4YU6|4.0|A must have for Beatles fans.  I did not own the previous version, so this was a first time viewing for me.  I wasn't alive when these aired, so it was great to see the Beatles TV introduction to the US.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This is one of the best flash I ever used.Every photographer should have one in his camera bag.I strongly recommend the SB 700.
0439023483|2.0|Out of the many who gave The Hunger Games rave reviews, mine is only fair.  Why?  This genre of book is not for everybody.  As a reader I felt like I was always at the mercy of an overbearing, controlling and cruel \\"Big Brother\\" type figure who on impulse would make really  ludicrous things happen to the characters in their fight 'till death competition.   Just when events in the story were about to make sense,  something crazy like mad dogs reincarnated from formerly dead players would be thrown into the plot.  There was no reason for it.   The characters all seemed to be missing a personality.    The heroine lacked emotion.  Her reaction to kissing a boy for the first time lacked in everything and made it rather dull.  I found myself feeling weary and annoyed from all the unlimited bad things that were uncontrollably going wrong.
142311339X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  While it follows the storyline of the Percy Jackson series, it is written in the style of the The Red Pyramid.  Rick Riordan is fast becoming one of my 3 favorite authors in the world, Esther Hicks, Rick Riordan, and J.K. Rowling.    This story ties the views of 3 main characters together seamlessly.  I really enjoyed the different personalities in the story.      I thought I knew a lot about Greek Mythology, but Rick always has something new to teach me.  He brings the stories that shaped our Western Society to life.  Thanks Rick!
044654759X|4.0|Some parts repetitive, but other than that, I enjoyed it. Good read. I love the twist at the end.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|After a ton of my friends told me \\"Oh my God, it was so scary!\\"  I decided to rent it.  Its supposed to seem like its a real story.  It moves very slowly and there isn't much action.  I'm not sure how you could find this movie to be very scary unless you are really on edge or think this is actually a real story.  I'm a pretty jumpy person during scary movies myself and even the end didn't phase me. The camera work is very shaky at times and it get rather dark. I don't recommend this to anyone.
0545265355|5.0|One of the best trilogies out there! Constant suspense and definitely a page turner!     At first I wasn't sure about buying these books. I'm not a big fan of fantasy, post-apocalyptic, harry potter etc etc type of books. However, I kept seeing good reviews about it while browsing for new reading materials. I finally decided to give it a try and ended up reading all the books in three days. I couldn't put them down! I never expected them to be so suspenseful from page one to the last page of the third book. The story just sucks you right in. Left me wanting more!
1416524800|1.0|I just shelled out 10 bucks for this piece of publishing garbage! Now I like Dan Brown's books and wouldn't normally knock them, but the brand new copy of Deception Point I bought is full of dozens of blank pages and at least a dozen half printed pages (the other half is grey!) Kind of hard to read a story when huge chunks of it are missing. If you intend to buy this book, I suggest you check every page for missing parts. I've read thousands of paper backs in my life time but I've never encountered such a publishing mess as this Simon and Shuster book!
0060555661|5.0|Having found this book through a recommendation by Warren Buffett (no, not a personal recommendation, from his 2003 shareholder letter and references in his biography), I had high expectations.  The book did not disappoint.  While somewhat academic at times, it provides a clear, well written primer on value investing without the \\"hype\\" of more recent investing books (no references to a \\"secret formula\\" that will make you \\"incredibly rich with almost no effort\\").  The commentary provided by Zweig was helpful to bring forth more modern terminology and translate the examples Graham provided into modern-day equivalents.
0739344269|5.0|I liked the Grand Design very much. The achievements in Physics were very well explained and summarized. More than once has to be listened or read. Highly recommended.
0812550706|5.0|I had to read this book for my 3000 level Science Fiction course in college. This really is such a great book. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a true \\"soft\\" Scifi reader. It has a nice mix of action and intellect to it. There wasn't even a dull moment and it's a quick read.

1594200823|1.0|I have heard this book to be interesting by several people I know, but upon reading it the only feeling I felt was disgust, and for a very different reason than most.    The author has taken an extremely narrow view of the farming industry, and while yes the industry does have flaws and not all farms and slaughterhouses operate perfectly (I fully condone that they should and if they don't they need to be fixed or shut down) the vast majority are perfectly humane and are run properly.    The biggest complaint that I have with this book is that the author CLEARLY does not understand how a cow's digestive system works.  I have a degree in Biology and another degree in Dairy Science, as well as a lifetime of experience on a dairy farm, so I would venture that I am much more knowledgable about the inner workings of cows than this man.  Cows absolutely can digest corn, high producing individuals NEED corn to survive, it is their main source of starch.  The rumen is basically a large fermentation vat, full of microbes that break down whatever the cow consumes.  Cow's shouldn't be fed only corn, but corn is a very valuable part of the diet of any cow.    Given his gross misrepresenation and flat out lies about this topic I am very hesitant to put any stock in anything else reported by this man.  Just because it's in print doesn't make it factual.      I would give this book zero stars if I could, but alas the least I can give it is one.
1400079144|2.0|Normally,I don't write a review on the Internet to be critical but I felt I had to do it after reading this book. I finished reading this book last evening and felt it was a total waste of time.  I should have looked at the customer review ratings prior to starting it.  It's interesting in that considering the large number of customer reviews, the number of those with 5 stars are nearly as much with 1 star.    First,Dan Brown's writing style in this book seems to not even be geared towards intelligent adults.  Secondly, I felt that he followed the same formula as in The Davinci Code.  The villain is the same type of nut job.  The time span of the story is in less then 24 hours and everything is at breakneck speed.  I also am in agreement with the other reviewers regarding the cliffhanger endings to several chapters such as \\"...and then Langdon saw it.\\"  Third, the \\"secret\\" was not something that \\"grabbed\\" the reader.  Fourth,the ending was tedious.  I felt that I had to get it over with. I can go on and on.    I feel that I have been generous in giving this book 2 stars, I am giving consideration to Brown in that he had to put effort into writing it.  I feel that I have been taken by Brown in buying it and wasting time on it.  I can't believe that he will hoodwink the public and make more money in putting out special illustrated editions, etc.  I don't think I will be reading any further writings of his.
B002VECM6S|5.0|It might be trite and overused, but goodness, it's so true.  Truth, ladies and gentlemen, is stranger than fiction.  If a fiction writer had penned a story about a well-to-do white family taking a gentle giant, homeless, African-American teenager under its wing to nurture and love until the young man develops into an All-American and NFL first round draft pick said story would rapidly go back into the slush pile.  Thank goodness, then, that THE BLIND SIDE, the highly inspirational and wonderful story about Michael Oher and the Tuohy family, is absolutely true; at the end of this movie (and after viewing actual photos of Oher and the Tuohys that predominate the closing credits) I was literally standing and cheering.<br /><br />I'm not that big on romcoms or chick flicks, which means Sandra Bullock doesn't do a whole lot for me.  But here, playing determined, always controlling Leigh Anne Tuohy, Bullock is remarkable.  Even I want to go pick up my room after she scolds one of her charges.  And Tim McGraw is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors.  Playing Sean Tuohy this country crooner makes acting look so easy.  Finally, kudos to a hulking Quinton Aaron as the silent, long suffering Oher.  Big Mike, as he's called, has never experienced love; when the Tuohys offer it to him in abundance he doesn't know how to react, so he's tentative and hesitant.  Aaron brings home the very human component of Michael Oher's fantastic journey from misery to belonging.  THE BLIND SIDE is an 80-yard Hail Mary with a two-point conversion. . .even with a brief Lou Holtz cameo.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

Dave Mustaine, Ozzy, Steven Adler.<br />This book goes into the life of Dave Mustaine. Alot of fights - fists and verbal. Actually there are more fist fights in this book than the Mohammed Ali book.<br /><br />It's so awesome that despite Dave's rampant drug use his memory is excellent. Every key moment in Dave's life is remembered in clear detail.<br /><br />I've had such a good time reading this book.<br /><br />Some rock bios just get bogged down in the drug taking and rehab. While there is alot of this in the book. Dave knows when to back off from boring the reader.

1400032717|5.0|This is a wonderful book, one of those cross-over books that could almost be a YA book. The hero is autistic, pretty high functioning most of the time, but he's found at the start of the book standing over the a dead dog. The Curious Incident is part thriller, part psychological novel, a comedy and a tragedy all in one. I found myself reading it breathlessly. There are scenes-- like the one in the London Underground, that are absolutely unforgettable. The story of one man's journey to discover the truth-- thereby uncovering far more than he ever expected-- makes this a genuine masterpiece. Highly recommended for general readers, really smart teenagers, and book club everywhere.
0061997811|5.0|I am a college student, and I like this book for what it is. If you own all the HP movies with the 2nd disc and have watched all the bonus content than this is your book.    It has at least 8 inserts within that you could pull out physically and stickers. If you are a collector of all things HP this is a must.    If you are looking for a nice little gift for someone then just get it, if they are half of a Harry Potter fan they will appreciate this as a gift or deserve to be disowned.    This isnt 160 pages of I NEVER KNEW THAT, but its 160 pages of \\"Thats funny, I knew it, so thats what Rons Grandma looks like, and things along that nature.\\" It gives you closer looks at things half expressed in videos and things you kind of notice hidden througout the movies.    I am not by any means the biggest HP fan, but I read all the books within the first two days of getting them , and have watched all of the movies in theatre. I support the HP franchise and this one is worth having on the shelf, and if your a scrapbook-er, have fun because there are pages a plenty to take out things.     I will note, that the inserts are not \\"perfect replicas\\" but more like copies of reasonable mention. They are on decent paper with printed texture and they are nice enough to where you can put them about your room or on a wall, but not so nice that you need to encase them in glass and put a 3 headed dog as a guard.    Very nice Christmas(Holiday) present for someone or B-day, and take my word for it, you can't go wrong letting people experience the magic behind and within the HP world and this book does just that and will give someone some definite moments of contentment.     Sincerely,    The Minnesotan Muggle
B003UYV08E|3.0|Not a bad movie, but no means a good one. While the first film was superior in everything, from sound to effects and more importantly, story. This sequel failed to deliver the goods the first promised. Overall a decent enough film with a few gosh wow scenes and decent enough acting by a good cast mixed with some humerous moments allowed this film to not be completely DOA but it lacks the freshness the first one had. Better luck next time guys.
B003OFHMKO|2.0|I probably should not even be rating this CD because I only listened to it once.  I read an interview with Esperanza Spalding and she sounded interesting and I thought her music sounded like it would be good.  One of the things I kept reading about in the interview and in different reviews was how she often wrote her own lyrics.  She also set music to poetry.  So, I was excited to hear this.  However, what nobody mentioned at least everywhere I looked, was that at least half of the songs on this CD (probably more) do not have lyrics at all.  She is singing but I guess really it is just scat that she is doing.  Anyway, it is very annoying to me and it just makes the music sound pretentious.  I like the first song quite well actually and I like the other songs which do have lyrics pretty well but all in all I think Spalding needs to work on tightening what it is she is trying to say as an artist and musician.
B003UESJJC|5.0|Simply put, I regard this picture as the greatest movie of all time. I have many favorites old and new, but this movie still is as hypnotic now in 2010 as it was in August 1979 when I saw it in the theaters.    The original theatrical version remains the best way to see this picture for me. But I am grateful for the redux version that allows us fans a different perspective also. And including HEARTS OF DARKNESS in the 3-disc BD (finally!) completes the package.    The picture/sound on this BD title is perfect: a 5 out of 5 for those needing a rating. I detected absolutely no problems or errors while watching ALL 3 discs (am I just lucky?).    Buy this 3-disc set, disappear into your man-cave for a weekend and watch what a true genus can do with film.      PS. I understand the confusion of the ending. I too, have seen the ending with the village being bombed while the end credits rolled also, but I can't seem to remember when exactly. Was it in the theater? on cable in the early 80s?    I never gave it much thought until I bought the Laserdisc in 1992. When the ending came, there was nothing. The credits required me to flip the disc over and that is when I asked: \\"Where's the village destruction?\\". You could hear the explosions but the background was black, yet the credits bounced around on the screen where apparently they were placed around the explosions onscreen.    Thankfully, these questions have been answered through DVD and now BD. The apocalyptic ending did exist, but was removed by Coppola. I respect his decision and feel the ending is better because of it.
B002ZG98H8|5.0|I was just reading a few reviews of this movie.  I'm very tired - jetlagged - and this opinion I'm expressing here is \\"off the top of my head\\" so please excuse the odd \\"error\\" or \\"inconsistancy\\".    I read in one review \\"mentally handicapped\\" and \\"retarded\\" - which just shows how poorly some people understand autism (I have Asperger's Syndrome).    Socially of course - that might be the case.  Then again - we live in a world of war and terror, of bullying and slavery ... and if one gets rid of the \\"mentally handicapped\\" autistic people - those things won't go away.  Everybody has a part to play in these things.  I'd suggest we're all \\"mentally handicapped\\" to allow such things to happen (gladly as we do as we all partake in the scavenged rewards) - or really such things are acceptable to us as part of our normal-functioning and we just like to pretend they're bad, for appearances and our perceived social status - the most important thing to most of us.    This movie is claimed by some to oversimplify things - e.g. regarding political posturing and the like.    They're right of course.    My point of view however is of a benign Aspie (person with Asperger's Syndrome).  I like people.  I do tend to see things in \\"black and white\\".  All people are imperfect.  We are all grey.  I think I'm safe in stating that.  There is conflict between my instinctive view of people, and my intellectual understanding of them.    I like this film because it chimes with my instinctive view and also addresses \\"justice\\" - often an important concept to Aspie's.    Let's face it - if people are not fundumentally altered with gene therapy, and are allowed freedoms, then we are always going to have conflict, prejudice, hypocrasy, tragedy, expoitation ... we are all part of the problemS in some form or other.  No amount of education is going to fundumentally change our humanity in a long-term persistent manner that's logically consistent accross differing contexts. We live in a social hierarchybased on power structure.  Some societies are perhaps more morale and successful in \\"fair structure\\" over-all than others.  I could go into the philosophy of morality or the meaning of logic or the validity of mathematical axioms - but this isn't really the place to do so.    This film does require a suspension of disbelief.  It does look at things rather simply - as someone with Asperger's might prefer to - or at least I would prefer to do so as a key thing about Autism is that every person with autism is very individual and more resistent to societal meme's.  Some things in life - some actions and stances by people or people(s) are particularly bad.  Some are particularly good.  It's comforting when there is clarity.  This film is over-simplified fiction - and I think quite wonderful.  Perhaps a particular mindset is required to properly appreciate its position - concepts possibly alien and incomprehensible to many.    I like it.  It made me cry.    Nb - I came accross these reviews as part of a partially related search - I haven't seen the blu-ray movie - only the cinematic presentation several months ago.  Also, if I recall, this film sits in a series of films intended to educate about various [and often poorly understood] \\"disabilities\\".  Autism is extremely complex and difficult to understand - I've spent the last two years trying to understand it and despite my intelligence, intellectual insights / academic training and ability, and experience of having Asperger's Syndrome and meeting many others with the condition, I still only vaguely understand it at best. There's a saying regarding Autism: approx. \\"After you've met one person with Autism, you've met one person with Autism\\".  It's not safe to (unscientifically / non-rigorously) interpolate.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|I emphasis BLU-RAY in my review title because I'm growing so tired of sifting through countless old DVD/Video reviews of movies on Amazon just to read about folk's opinions of the BD versions. Why can't Amazon separate the old reviews from the BD titles? Can someone please answer that question?    I appreciate also, that many of you love to write. You all are very good writers. But I don't need to re-read a thousand times what a particular film is all about. I usually know what it's about already.    What I want to know is: Is it worth upgrading to BD? What are your thoughts on the discs extra features (if any). And if you must, a quick opinion of the film itself, like: \\"This is the GREATEST movie ever made!!!\\".    This BD of KING KONG (1933) was a blind-buy for me. I own the SE from a few years back but I wanted the most newest version on the most newest format. If there were any issues with the picture/sound quality, I didn't care as I watched it. This movie is amazing.    Hopefully, someone in a Brazil basement somewhere will discover an uncut untouched negative someday. By then we'll be watching 4K transferred discs. Until then, what are you waiting for, buy this BD and enjoy!
B0018QQQKS|5.0|Probably the best history book I've ever read. I think it also qualifies as the best book I've read so far in 2009. Definitely worth reading for anyone who wants to make sense of the historical development of the  financial world we live in and its continuous evolution. I don't normally like to read history books, but this guy just knows how to make history fun!
B003DZX44I|5.0|Of all my BDs, the ones from Disney consistently look and sound the best over all the others. I wish I was getting paid for saying that but unfortunately, I'm not.    Disney's recent release of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST on BD looks so good that it has the appearance of 3D. As I watched this blu-ray, the colors seemed to jump out and have a three dimensional space. The sound is flawless. Even though B&TB isn't my favorite Disney film, I find myself amazed at this BD version. I only hope that their Fantasia set coming soon will be just as good.    If you like this picture and have blu-ray in your home, this is definitely worth your money!
1441842616|5.0|I read the review for this book in School Library Journal and wanted to get my hands on it immediately.  It didn't disappoint!  To quote Tiny Cooper....Will Grayson, Will Grayson is FABULOUS!!  I'm a Youth Services Librarian who listens to a lot of YA audiobooks, but this one really stands out.  It's funny, sad and thought-provoking, and the characters are unforgettable.  Tiny Cooper, despite falling in love every other minute, is wise beyond his years.  Both Will Graysons are colorful characters, even though at first glance (next to Tiny), they're not.     The audiobook was performed by MacLeod Andrews and Nick Podehl, and they ROCKED as the two Wills and especially Tiny. I HIGHLY recommend that you listen to it!    I also loved the ending, but was sad the book had to end.  I'll recommend this to teens again and again!
B00006AW2J|5.0|This is easily the greatest Rolling Stones album and one of the most important Rock 'n' Roll albums of all time. For one; it is Mick's last LP before becoming a parody of himself.   This LP marks an important transition/landmark between Pop blues 'interpretation' and synthesis of Delta/Chicago Blues. Heady and pretentious terms, to be sure, but... That feeling we got when first hearing this... Unforgettable. Another excellent example of making an A and B sided LP: the perfect first song, the perfect song just before that pause prior to changing sides,the perfect entree to the second side and the perfect finale.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|...... but make sure the songs are remixed or there is no real market for this album. Every song is outstanding and a remix of the music would awaken this sleeping beauty.    Do it, and do it real soon.

This could have been something huge but it's not, and people who give this 5 stars are the ones with no quality opinion and only review the item from a blind Slipknot fan side of view.
B000001FQR|5.0|I'm definitely not in my 40's.  You need to go north of 60 to figure my age. I like the up-beat music on this CD.  Originally, when I heard it, CD's were not in the stores...only in the tech. parts of newspapers.  I bought the CD's and cassettes again.  Why the cassettes?; some friends are not out of the middle 20th century.  It was music for exercise workouts, fast walking, peppy house cleaning...not considered too offensive.  I passed the cassettes to my \\"old\\" friends who are glad to hear it again.  And we have begun to do at least housework and other chores while having it for background music.  Yes, we still like \\"Hot In the Shade.\\"  My grandchildren have a CD and they like the \\"earlier\\" stuff.  It is good.  If you have not heard it in a long time or you have never heard it...you owe it to yourself to \\"check it out.\\"  What is \\"old\\" could easily become \\"new\\" again.

0307454541|4.0|This Swedish murder mystery is entangled with crime, deceit, love, lust, & dangerous cover-ups.  While the novel begins slowly with a meticulous detailed introduction of the characters, it quickly picks up leaving readers wanting to know the next moment of each character's life and the adversities they each face.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is a dynamic, yet awkward 24 year-old main character covered in an array of tattoos, who plays an integral part in solving the mystery of a young girl's disappearance left unanswered for 36 years.  Though she has Asperger's Syndrome, Lisbeth shows perseverance, grit and strength while dealing with issues ranging from sexual abuse to unjust regulations under a mandated state guardianship.<br /><br />The novel begins with a detailed description of Mikael Blomkvist, who has been accused of libel and recently given a jail sentence.  While Blomkvist is forced to temporarily walk away from his previous duties at his newspaper, he is snatched up by Henrik Vanger and asked to delve into the mystery of the disappearance of his granddaughter some 36 years earlier.  Along the way, a surprisingly chilling past of the Vanger history is unveiled.  Salander, known for her incomparable intelligence and extraordinary computer-hacking skills, helps Blomkvist in finding each piece of the puzzle along the way.<br /><br />Though this novel is addictive and intriguing, Sweden's statistically abusive past is gruesomely described in several scenes of the novel.  At times the book is difficult to walk away from and sometimes too sickening to continue reading.  The captivating Vanger family characters, evolution of Salander and perseverance of Blomkvist are fascinating and make this mystery, though sometimes violent and confusing, easier to read.  The mystery and the relationships between the characters make this novel very intriguing and thought-provoking.  I found myself thinking about the characters and their foolish decisions, wanting to find out more about this skinny, intelligent and mysterious young girl, and wondering if the mystery would truly ever be resolved.  Though some of the content may be disturbing and difficult for a sensitive reader, the message that Larsson portrays is clear:  Perseverance and determination pay off, and abuse/violence must come to an end.<br /><br />This book was highly recommended by my colleagues and though it was difficult for me to imagine some of the characters and horrific abusive encounters at first, Larsson's careful attention to detail and character development make this thriller a book I couldn't put down.  I am eager to read the other books in the series to discover how the characters and the story continue to unfold.about this skinny, intelligent and mysterious young girl, and wondering if the mystery would truly ever be resolved.

031603438X|3.0|So, after decades of balancing self-destructive behavior and unflinching dedication to the now venerable institution of The Rolling Stones, Keith Richards has become a cultural icon and has written a book about his life and his music. \\"Life\\" has been received with uniformly glowing reviews. \\"The New York Times\\" alone has published three (\\"A Writing Stone; Chapter and Verse\\" by Michiko Kakutani, October 25, 2010; \\"Keith Richards has Memories to Burn\\" by Janet Maslin, October 20, 2010; \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" by Liz Phair on November 4). Even the venerable \\"New Yorker\\" devoted a multi-page review to the book (\\"Groovin' High, David Denby, November 1, 2010). \\"The New Republic\\" picked it as one of the best books of 2010.  I'm sure a review will be forthcoming in NYRB, too.<br /><br />I suspect that an unacknowledged component of the warm critical reception is attributable to the \\"115 year old man\\" phenomenon (he's interesting because he's still there and has seen it all; a living fossil, sort of like a human coelacanth fished from the waters not of the Chalumna River but from the Perrier spring) and much is due to simple voyeurism. In other words, Keith is now a living legend and the Stones are a cultural and musical fixture. Who wouldn't want the insider's perspectives, the \\"true story\\", at last from the group's dynamic and newsworthy engine, Keith (who needs no last name) himself instead of the relatively lackluster bassist, Bill Wyman? \\"Mick Jagger\\" wrote about \\"Life\\" (more on this later, as Keith is fond of putting it), \\"Oh, the stories. The rock, the girls. The car wrecks, the arrests. You read them on the printed page, delivered in what, I must admit, is a pretty fair written representation of Keith's slightly tangential, drawling, effeminate delivery, resting charmingly just this side of the incomprehensible.\\"<br /><br />As might be expected of a group whose career has spanned the period from around 1962 through the present date, there have been some major changes but surprisingly, not much evolution. Musically, at least, The Stones know what works and what sells. According to a fascinating report 96 page report published in \\"Granta\\" (number 12) by Stanley Booth (\\"The True Adventures of the Rolling Stones\\"), the early Stones were pretty much as they were represented to be: nasty, smug, self-indulgent prodigal sons. They were (and remain) commercially ambitious, as illustrated by this excerpt Booth cites from a New York interview (1969). In it, Mick Jagger was asked the question, \\"Are the Stones more satisfied today?\\". The candid interchange is worth quoting:<br />Mick: \\"Sexually d'you mean, or philosophically?\\"<br />Reporter: \\"Both.\\"<br />Mick: \\"Sexually-more satisfied. Financially-dissatisfied. Philosophically-still trying.\\"<br /><br />As Keith candidly notes, very early in the Stones' career, manager Andrew Loog Oldham seized on their less-than-perfect and non-conformist appearances (especially in contrast to the oh-so-cute-and-cuddly Beatles) and made the brilliant decision to market the Stones as the quintessential bad boys, a role eagerly embraced by the group. They whole heartedly embraced the old Mae West axiom, \\"There's no such thing as bad publicity\\" and proceeded to generate plenty of it. Oldham's pragmatic and canny marketing strategy also happened to synch well with the personalities and proclivities of the group members. Oldham's brilliant promotional insight meshed perfectly with the zeitgeist. While now quite ancient and somewhat mutated and shopworn, the same message continues to sell.<br /><br />The book is framed in three parts (musical, personal and literary).  As might be expected, most of \\"Life\\" is centered on Keith's music and its influences, all which is exhaustively catalogued. Keith does best in this area and his music is, to my mind anyway, better understood after having read the book.  So, from this perspective, the book rates \\"five stars\\".  Next, his many friends, acquaintances and professional colleagues appear and acerbic, sometimes lacerating commentaries appear which, I suppose, represent brutally honest appraisals rendered by an authentic critic who's earned the right to pass judgement. That, at least, seems to be Keith's implicit and sometimes explicit posture. Some, who demonstrate fealty to the ideal such as Charlie Watts, emerge unscathed. Others, such as Brian Jones and (to a lesser extent) Mick Jagger are badly bruised. One, bassist Bill Wyman, is ignored to the point of near oblivion: he, evidently, was recruited primarily because of an amplifier he owned. A little more commentary from Keith on why Bill has been largely relegated to oblivion would have been appreciated (I've not read \\"Stone Alone\\", so I am unaware of Bill's own perspectives). From the \\"personal\\" perspective, the book ranks \\"three stars\\".  From a literary perspective, the book falls short. It does not compare favorably with \\"Chronicles\\" (Dylan) nor with \\"Straight Life\\" (Art Pepper) and would not merit much independent interest were it not for the author's prominence.  This aspect ranks \\"two stars\\".<br /><br />Given the role of rock music in \\"the Sixties\\", there is another dimension to be considered, especially given the premier position enjoyed then (and to a lesser extent) now by The Stones. I am referring to Mick's 1969 interview comment on the band's philosophy. What I had hoped for, but found little evidence of, was how Keith might reconcile embrace of the rebel philosphy (lifestyle) with the remorseless pursuit of commercial success. How did the Stones evolve into the contradictory institution that they are today? For explanation, you are left to your own devices. Charlie Watts represents one end of the possible spectrum: bespoke suits, quiet and reserved, a professional doing a job by Keith's account (except he became a heroin user, too: an occupational hazard). Keith Richards and his \\"mate\\" Mick Jagger, on the other hand, best embody the contradictions. In \\"Life\\", Mick is occasionally dismissed as a conniving social climber, a virtual arriviste. Keith, on the other hand, maintains his professional \\"integrity\\" as the heavy duty drug user with privileged access to the finest pharmaceutical-grade cocaine and best weed/heroin/acid, etc (yet protected by layers of legal defense and a web of influential connections); the \\"screw you\\" attitude to society (whilst purchasing homes in Switzerland, the Caribbean, France and elsewhere); the intrepid bluesman (with legions of retainers and servants); the street fightin' man, quick of temper and blade (but virtually immune to the consequences of his volatile temper)...and so on.<br /><br />While the 547 page long autobiography nicely defines life's many problems if one is a member of The Rolling Stones, Keith displays no penchant for deep reflection nor for introspection, either. In other words, there is no deliberate effort made at personal understanding and social-political perspective. For the reader, the epiphany is that, at least if you are Keith, you can have it all; the limited-edition Bentley (one of 85 made), private jets, great drugs, 7 million dollar advance from Little Brown publishers. That, in fact, is the goal. The resolution of the discordant facts, in this case, has been achieved by redefining the question (\\"squaring the circle\\"), so the contradiction between vast commercial success, wealth and cultural authenticity are made to vanish; the \\"medium is the message is the lifestyle\\". Of course, one can go too far. Take Keith's umbrage on Mick's knighthood and his jet-set friends, for example. But, Keith has no problems with Mick's estate in the Loire Valley. As long as you spurn the \\"Sir\\" and hang with the Rastas, its just fine!<br /><br />Bill Wyman kept notebooks and is reportedly the Stones' \\"keeper of the archives\\". He was supposedly sent a response to \\"Life\\" from Mick Jagger. This response was alleged to have been \\"misdirected\\" and ended up on the desk of reporter Bill Wyman (not the same fellow!) who published it in SLATE. The apocryphal Mick, (who, in fact, did not write this as Wyman himself communicated to me) is obviously a shrewd and intelligent observer and an articulate one, too. The Wyman (reporter) piece wryly summarizes Keith's observations, thusly: \\"I am, I see here, marginally endowed, if I read Keith's sniggering aright. I do not sing well, either. I am not polite to employees; indeed, I have even been known to say, \\"Oh, shut up, Keith,\\" in band meetings. I do not appreciate the authenticity of the music or the importance of what we do. I want to \\"lord it over\\" the band, like James Brown. I am \\"insufferable.\\" I slept with Anita. Most of that is in just the first quarter of this overlong book, but a tattoo of my failings sounds all through it and culminates in almost 20 full pages of rambling invective near the end.\\" He candidly acknowledges Keith's talent: \\"Keith's talent. We took it for granted, in a way, as he says. We felt it was our duty to get together and write a song, one good song each day we worked. He is kind to say I could take what he gave me and run with it. But he is the one who gave me the actual song to write the lyrics to. He wrote a dozen Top 10 hits in five years, and, after the band added Mick Taylor and essentially grew up, he wrote most of Beggars Banquet and Let It Bleed.\\"<br /><br />To sum up, Keith's book hardly presents a balanced perspective or even a complete history of this seminal rock group. It is lacking in many other regards and might be best read and appreciated as a history of Keith's evolution as a musician. His work with the Stones is simply beyond reproach, especially the material from the \\"middle years\\", which maintains its vigor, clarity and integrity, almost alone amongst rock music, past and present.  As the \\"Mick\\" of the Slate article concludes, \\"Here's the thing: I'm a rock star. What is the measure of my success if not the biggest rock and roll tour of all time?...I know what you're thinking. It's what Keith thinks, too.

0439023513|1.0|After waiting a year and finally getting the book into my hands, I expected to devour it. Sadly I never even found the book interesting. In my opinion it would have been better to extend \\"Catching Fire\\" and wrapped things up at the end of it.     Perhaps the tone was a metaphor to depict the way people are worn down by a long drawn out war...that's the way it read...sluggish, worn out....barely able to move.  If I were Gale I would have moved away too!
1599218011|5.0|Crazy Sexy Diet is an amazing book - filled with fun and facts and happy inspiration.  I have read a lot of books about cleansing, raw food and veganism, but Kris takes a big and unwieldy topic - healthy eating - and makes it raucous and sexy. Both newbies to healthy and raw eating and old hats at juicing and nutrition will find something to love about this book.  Her attitude, fearless and no-holds-barred, is helpful in keeping your attention especially when she's talking about vitamins, minerals, science, and your intestines.  Aside from the 411 on food, Kris encourages you to give good food a go and keeps your sprits up because she knows it's not so easy if you have haven't eaten well as a matter of course. Her cleanse program is gentle and do-able - and you can choose your own pace.  Kris is flexible and open minded and ultimately a realist. So, while she does have a strong POV, she does not expect you to snap to attention over night and do cart wheels like a trained seal. She wants you to come to her conclusion at your own pace - because she knows she's right and she is. If you want to be sexy, I think there's no better way to start than with the Crazy Sexy Diet.
0439023521|5.0|I just couldn't stop flipping the pages of this book. It's a book that I truly enjoyed reading and of course had to run out to buy Catching Fire as soon as I finished reading The Hunger Games. Suzanne Collins does a terrific job of telling the story with just enough detail to make you feel as if you are right with Katniss, but not too much detail to bore you to tears.     I highly recommend this book.
B003OY91HW|5.0|I have made several recipes from these book and all have turned out excellent, much better than any desserts I ever baked before. I made the oatmeal muffins, the peaches and cream pie, the cream cheese icing, the pumpkin bars, the chocolate chip cookies, and the apple pie crust. I find the directions very easy to follow, and the techniques, while not difficult, are precisely described so that your baking comes out perfectly. I am really more of a cook than a baker, and I appreciate directions like, \\"on the medium speed of a mixer, beat the mixture for 3 minutes.\\" It is so much easier to follow than something like, \\"Beat  until it becomes thick.\\" They really tested these recipes well.

0811870413|5.0|Chad Robertson's book is a detailed walkthrough of the artisan bread-making method.  I've been to pastry and baking school and can assure you that we used many of the same methods.  What sets this book apart is his focus on testing all of these recipes with the home baker.  Even the bread on the cover was produced by a home tester.  I inherited a starter so I used it to make the french country loaves and achieved amazing results.  The crumb was beautiful and the crust came out crispy thanks to his dutch oven steam method for home bakers.  This will be my new go-to book when I'm baking bread.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|A wonderful rendition of Robin Hood!  Russell Crowe gives his usual terrific performance in this story that leads up to his title of Robin Hood!  Kate Blanchett plays a rugged Maid Marion with a sweet, softer side!  It's a must see!
B000KIPT30|2.0|I bought this about a year ago.  A month after it was put into use one of the outputs would only play the right chanel.  Now 2 of the ouputs only play the right chanel.  I tossed it in the garabage as there are no serviceable parts inside.

B002N8A14M|1.0|Although the case fits around my Ipod, unfortunately the access hole does NOT line up with the unit.  You have to pull the case apart every time you want to change songs.  Extremely poor design.  I would not recommend this product for anyone.  Find a different manufacturer.
B000JML7YC|4.0|Before you read this free version of Northager Abbey I'd recommend watching [[ASIN:B000Z27HLS Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey]]. I can almost guarantee you will prefer the story that plays out in the movie. Still it is intriguing to compare the movie to the book. In the movie John Thorpe is much more likeable although annoying at times. In the book he is much more rude and coarse. I instantly disliked him for being rude to his mother and for treating his horse badly. What surprised me is how little we learn about Henry. He is fairly uninteresting and not very romantic. To compare him to say Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice would never do. Isabella is much more shrill in the book and is much more naughty in the movie. Catherine Morland is really the most developed character in the book although Jane Austen doesn't do a good job of explaining why she is so attracted to Henry. What amused me most was how Jane Austen talked directly to the reader about the value of novels. It was as if she was preaching to the choir. This Kindle version is nearly perfect - only one spelling error!<br /><br />~ The Rebecca Review

1401323952|5.0|This is another fabulous book by Nigella Lawson. It is filled with wonderful recipes and her trademark, charming prose. The great thing about this book (and indeed all of her books) is that it is filled with the kind of food you actually want to eat and to serve to guests. The tone of her recipes are just right. They aren't intimidating and \\"chefy\\", and nor do they suffer from the \\"wasn't that E-Z\\" mantra that the Food network crowd serves up. Rather, they are tasty and homey as well as elegant and special.   In comparison to her other books, this one does stand out. It has all the best elements of \\"Express\\" and \\"Feast\\" along with the conversational narrative of \\"How to Eat\\". The photography is also wonderful and echos her other books. This then, is a go to whether you are looking for a quick weeknight meal or a special meal with freinds or a special occasion. It's all there!  Personal favorites from this have been: Baked Egg Custard, No Fuss Fruit Tart, Lemon Meruinge Fool, Mexican Lasagne, Avocado Salsa, Spanish Chicken and Chorizo, Praised Chicken, Grasshopper Pie,  Irish Oaten Rolls, Lemon Polenta Cake, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Carbonnade a la flamande, Pappardelle with Butternut and Blue Cheese, Date Steak, Risotto Bolognese, Wholegrain Mustard and Ginger Cocktail Sausages, Chocolate Chip Cookies, Maple Pecan Bundt Cake, Jumbleberry Jam, Barbecued Ground Beef, Blueberry Cornmeal Muffins,  Chocolate Key Lime Pie, Spring Chicken, Mussels with Cider, Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheesecake, Crisp Chicken Cutlets, Venetian Carrot Cake, Asian Braised Beef Shank, Hot and Sour Shredded Salad, Tangy Mashed Potatoes and Parsnips, Chicken with 40 Cloves of Garlic, Frangelico Tiramisu, Egg and Bacon Salad, Flourless Chocolate Lime Cake, Buttermilk Scones, Strawberry Almond Crumble, Tarragon Chicken, Seed Cake, Coconut and Cherry Banana Bread, Sherry Glazed Chorizo, Homestyle Jerk Chicken, Rice and Peas, No Churn Pina Colada Ice Cream, Swedish Summer Cake, Chicken Teriyaki, Chicken Fajitas, Jumbo Chili Sauce, Sunshine Soup, African Drumsticks, Turkey Meatballs in Tomato Sauce, Chicken with Greek Herb Sauce, Chocolate Orange Loaf Cake, Guinness Gingerbread, Blondies, Devils Food Cake, Slut's Spaghetti, and, Avocado Quessadillas. These recipes only scratch the surface, the book is crammed with many more tempting recipe ideas.  I know the above list looks long, but it is an honest account of the recipes that I have made multiple times. They are so good, they were definitley worth repeating!!  This book is also very informational and would make a great wedding or housewarming present. More than that, Nigella Lawson is a wonderful writer and speaks passionatley about her subject. This book reminds us that you don't have to be a trained chef to cook marvelous food. It also encourages us to gather our freinds and family around us and share in everything from weeknight meals to larger occasions, and make them special. I cannot reccomend this book enough,it is the definitive guide on proper home food!  UPDATE: 08/24/11 - I have been using this book for about a year and am still completely impressed. It is such a valuable resource. It has everything I need for entertaining, family meals, and eating healthy. I know the latter does not sound like a normal feature of Nigella Lawson recipes, but there are several here that fit neatly into a low cal. lifestyle. This book is a great buy and a real workhorse in the kitchen!
B0042AEOG0|5.0|You have to listen to this album in it's entirety. it's such an unearthly experience.     Classic's in the Making are in my opinion are the following;     One Child  Christmas Time Is In The Air Again  Oh Santa  When Christmas Comes  Oh Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah-(chorus)     (4 of these Mariah Wrote, produced etc)   Also, it has a little t of everything to please all of her fans.. I'm amazed that some fans may like one song and then another person dislikes that certain song etc.. she is amazing!  BUY IT!!
B003VIW8DK|2.0|I was looking forward to this release being a fan of both Bryan Ferry solo and of Roxy Music.  But, unfortunately this release follows the modern trend of producing music much too hot.  The volume is pumped up so high as to saturate the allowed bandwith into clipping which truncates the wave forms and ruins any chance of preserving dynamic range.  This is also called digital compression.  Dynamic range is a big part of what makes music music.  This is why you read from other reviewers how this recording sounds flat with all the instruments and vocals sounding at the same level.  That is because compression has made it so.  This is not just an opinion of what I hear.  It is a fact that can be easily measured and seen by anyone with a simple computer program.
B00008DYQA|5.0|I didnt quite know what to think when I read the reviews of this movie but I LOVE James Spader so I bought it and I was so pleasantly surprised.  I thought it would be that he was dominating her and that she acquiesed to him ultimately, but that's not it.  He frees her and lets her be who she is without being ashamed.  I love that. And she actually embraces her feeling more than he does at first.  She accepts it and he feels guilty about it and doesnt really understand why he is the way he is.  She doesnt care and all she knows is that she likes it.  I guess I am rambling but the bottom line is that 2 consenting adults should be able to do whatever floats their boat as long as it isnt hurting anyone else and that is basically what this movie is about.  No one in my opinion does love/sex scenes better than Mr. Spader and the final scenes when he gives in and admits that he loves her are so sweet and real.  I just loved it.  It's worth watching the whole movie just for that bathtub scene.  I really like this movie--glad I bought it and will continue to watch it over and over.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|There are some wonderful five star reviews that you can listen to if you have not seen the movie yet.<br /><br />It may have seemed slow in this flash/bang/whizz lightening speed laugh-a-minute, dripping blood and guts era of moviedom. However, I remember movies with plots that involved human beings in ordinary lives punctuated with extraordinary moments. A story worth getting caught up in. Humor and drama. And I guess by today's standards, those movies were slow. But the dialogue was worth listening to and remembering as you followed the characters through the story. As you participated with the characters, each and every one.<br /><br />That's what I loved about \\"Hereafter\\". And that's why I could have lived in it another hour. At least.
044654759X|4.0|It is a quick read, and with all Sparks books there is sadness.  The book is easy to read, but you will feel like you have read it before.  I enjoyed parts of the book, but for the most part I just read.  I wish he would find a different venue this novel had I want to write a book so I can make another movie.  The reason I gave four stars is that is an easy read and it does entertain, but that is about all there is.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|Avatar is my all-time favorite movie. I've been waiting for this release for a long time so that I could see the extra footage. But changing disks in the middle of an action movie is just guaranteed to ruin the flow of the experience. All they had to do was invest in a fourth disk and each version could have stood alone on it's own disk. Do they really have to economize this way?    I was about to buy this set, but instead I've just purchased the single disk original theatrical release. Good enough until the \\"ultimate special edition\\" comes out with individual disks for the different versions of the movie.

B003F3NDP8|2.0|I am sorely disappointed in the product. The seller said it was like new. Clearly their definition of like new means tattered & in bad condition.
B001JNND9W|4.0|First off, this is a spoiler, so do not read further if  you do not want the end revealed.    I personally thought the ending sucks!! The producers should have let  him get to San Francisco alive and a Folk Hero. You may say, that is the way too many hollywood movies give in to popular taste, but if is the way I feel.
B000VNMMPM|4.0|I first saw this theatrically, at our local art-house, The Roxy, in 2007. Surprisingly there were a dozen or so people in the audience for the weekday showing, though the film only ended up playing for a week.  I saw it again this past week, and it was well worth the review; apparently it has faded into obscurity, more or less, which goes to show me along with many of my other movies interests that I'm an outsider - as I like this far, far more than any of director Luc Besson's more famous films like LEON, aka THE PROFESSIONAL, or THE FIFTH ELEMENT.<br /><br />It's too bad this has been generally ignored; although it's nothing close to great, this was the first Besson film I've seen that I actually liked, largely because the characters are closer to being human (even though one of them apparently is something more) than in any of his previous work - and the style seems more at the service of the story and people than as something crowding everything else out.  The basic plot elements are familiar enough, cribbed as they are from such films as IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, WINGS OF DESIRE and HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, but the intense focus on just two characters (Jamel Debbouze as small and small-time crook Andr&eacute; and Rie Rasmussen as tall cool blonde Angel, who may or may not be what her name indicates) gives the film an intimacy quite different from most of these other \\"heavenly\\" romances. The arguing and whining that dominate the first third of the movie, as model-gorgeous Angel suddenly shows up in desperate would-be suicide Andr&eacute;'s life and has to convince him to start living again, get to be a bit irritating, but I found my interest building as we spend more time with this very odd couple, and the ecstatic finale worked in spite of it's over-the-top craziness.<br /><br />The monochrome photography was nice -- at this point, any new film with a healthy budget that is shot in black-and-white gets a point just for that -- and I loved how the tourist's Paris dominates both the bleak early scenes and the emotional later ones -- every shot, it seems, has the Eiffel Tower, the Seine, and/or Notre-Dame somewhere in the frame.  It's as if the architecture itself is beckoning to Andr&eacute; to get out of his rut - to live a better life.  I liked that for once, Besson's female lead actually seems to have some reality beyond being a \\"babe\\", and Rasmussen's performance is perhaps the best I've seen in any of his films. No masterpiece, but some masterful moments and it actually makes me a bit interested in catching some of the director's earliest films.rly scenes and the emotional later ones -- every shot, it seems, has the Eiffel Tower, the Seine, and/or Notre-Dame somewhere in the frame.

0439023521|5.0|I am 62 (the wife of James) and read this book when I borrowed it from my daughter.  I didn't know what to expect, since it is in with The Twilight Series for the younger generation.  I couldn't put this book down.  It's full of romance, adventure, decision making, doing what is right, survival, you know, all those great things that we learn from living.  I recommend it to ages 13 on up.  Hope they make a movie!  James is reading it next!

0345505387|2.0|I guess it's my fault for not reading the description more carefully. I just assumed I would love anything from Diana Gabaldon, particularly entitled Outlander. I didn't realize what a graphic novel was and now I know that I don't care for them; it's just not \\"my cup of tea.\\" I also was really unhappy with the profuse cursing of Jesus' name. If the books had had that much swearing I would never have continued to read them, as much as I really love her writing. That is totally not necessary. I will be more aware of what I'm purchasing from now on.
0596806027|5.0|Mark begins with the history of HTML5 (using email archaeology, as he calls it). You'd never guess that many of the problems we have with XHTML, MIME types, etc. have roots in discussions over 20 years ago. From then on, he moves into feature detection (which uses the Modernizr library), new tags, canvas, video, geo-location, storage, offline web apps, new form features and microdata. Each chapter can be read independently - so if you're planning to use this as a reference, you may be better of reading the links kept up-to-date at DiveIntoHTML5.org. If you're interesting in learning about the features, it's a very readable book, terse, simple, and above all, delightfully intelligent.    Incidentally, if you're starting off on a new HTML5 project, you're probably best off using HTML5BoilerPlate.com. It's very actively maintained, and contains some really nifty tricks you can learn like the protocol-relative URL.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Esta pelicula es tan buena como sus dos predecesoras.  Excelente opcion para toda la familia. Definitivamente Toy Story es una trilogia clasica, nunca pasara de moda.
B0048Y9TPG|5.0|Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas II You is a wonderful collection of traditional and original tunes. The vocals are rich and the overall tone of the album is just delightful, exactly the kind of music I like to hear at Christmastime. I will not review each track since there are many such reviews but \\"One Child\\" is a big stand-out. And to think that this is an original song by Mariah Carey! Overall,  I give this album AAA+.  Kudos to Mariah Carey for giving the world yet another reason to be merry at Christmastime as we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.
031603438X|3.0|The first third of the book is absolutely fantastic. Keith Richards chronicles his childhood and the formation of the band with lots of personality and charm. Highly recommended. I really couldn't put the book down.     The book loses steam in the middle third -- the drugged-out 70s. I wish a little more time was spent talking about the music. When he *does* write about how songs come together, or about musical insights he has (like discovery open tuning), it's great reading. The sections where his son Marlon talks about life on the road with his dad are interesting. But much of the middle just gets bogged down in all the drugs, the drug busts, the cold turkey sessions, etc. Yeah OK, that was his life, but they were still making records, and a better balance of material about the band and the music would have been a nice respite from all the drugs.    It gets a bit better when he's writing about the late-80s/90s - the split with Mick and their respective solo careers.    But the final section just falls apart. It reads like the anecdotes that celebrities tell on talk shows. \\"Ah, the funniest thing happened at my daughter's wedding ....\\" \\"The crew found a puppy hanging around near the stage ....\\" \\"You wouldn't believe the enormous snapping turtle ....\\"     And there are some odd omissions: Bill Wyman is barely mentioned, which is fine, but more explanation is needed. Some of the biggest Stones albums are glossed over in half a page. Great songs like Shattered and Some Girls aren't even mentioned. The mixing and release of Tattoo You is barely discussed (if at all ... I don't recall now).     So 5 stars for the first third / 3 stars for the middle / 2 for the end.   Still worth it, especially for Stones fans.
B003XU75QG|5.0|This is a great album, though like someone else said they should have added more of her songs. Zombie, heart, and blender would have been great songs for it.
0670032506|5.0|In trying to accomplish something either I, or my company, will most often be confronted by two important questions:    \\"How do I...?\\"   And, \\"Why should I...?\\"     \\"Getting Things Done\\" thoroughly addresses the \\"How do I get things done?\\" question. And, in doing so, the question of \\"why\\" is addressed in a general and useful way.    But someone who has developed and refined an advanced skill - and gone on to teach it successfully to others has insights into the human condition that are unique to that expertise and experience.    \\"Ready for Anything\\" is the David's journal of insights garnered along his journey of teaching and learning how to get things done. He has some great insights to share. One of them was that he doesn't live and die by the list. The point of the list is to keep the mind free.    And, from the introduction to Part II: \\"The greatest power we have to affect our world is always at our fingertips: our ability to change how we see things.     Getting something to happen quicker, better and bigger is seldom dependent on greater physical effort-it's more than likely going to require a shift in vision.\\"    I have had a few really helpful \\"ah-has\\" as the result of reading this book and I keep it out where I can pick it up and thumb through it now and then. You know, those little insights that give direction and leverage over some little confusion or mystery that was previously befuddling. I really enjoy David's musings and find his insights accessible, positive, and valuable.    I constantly refer to \\"Getting Things Done\\" to refine my process. But I keep thumbing through \\"Ready for Anything\\" to pry loose deeper insights into my own behavior (and that of significant others) and as a gyroscope for keeping my \\"whys\\" on track.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Nowadays there are much better sources of information about bodybuilding than this old video. However, Pumping iron is Arnold's stuff: a great (sometimes funny) documentary from the number one ! For those of you who love Arnold, this video should be a must have.
0316069485|3.0|Michael Connelly's latest, The Reversal (2010), is a disappointment.  One positive is that Harry Bosch doesn't shoot up half of LA county, as he did Hong Kong in the last book (9 Dragons, 2009), and the overall story is not as disturbing as The Scarecrow (2009).  The story line is not particularly engaging (a new trial for a man convicted of killing a 12 year old girl 24 years before), and predictably Connelly can't end a rather dull story line without a body count approaching that of the Battle of Shiloh.  You would think Connelly could be clever enough to end this insipid courtroom drama in more believable fashion.  The judge might be the most interesting character in the novel.  He teams Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller again, a team that should be scintilating but doesn't really click.  I guess it doesn't click because both of them are in new roles:  Mickey Haller as prosecuting attorney and Bosch as an experienced and competent detective doing solid detective work.  Mickey seems out of place without his Lincoln.  I think Connelly is largely living off his past honors, but he's going to have to come to grips soon with the fact that Bosch has 35 years in the police force, making him at least 60 and ready for retirement.  Haller's not much younger.  Where can Connelly go from here?   Not to more scarecrow stuff, I hope.  Bosch as an investigator for Haller after he retires sounds like a possibility.  Let's hope that any future collaboration between them has a better plot to work with.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Within the same day I looked at this book as an option, I had the pleasure of hearing NPR's Fresh Air feature interview with Patti Smith.  She was promoting the book--the story she told touched me, and so I took a chance and got the book.  I LOVED the writing, the simplistic voice, and the wonderful love story between Robert and Patti.  Such a touching novel.  If you're on the fence about getting it, don't hesitate.  It's such a sweet read.

B001H9MYPW|5.0|IN TREATMENT is back for a second season, and the now divorced and living in New York psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne), is not only the defendant in a malpractice suit stemming from the death of one of his first season patients (Blair Underwood), but he also has four new people occupying his couch.  They include Mia (Hope Davis), an top attorney who Paul had treated twenty years earlier, April (Alison Pill), a college student denying the fact that she has cancer, Oliver (Aaron Shaw), caught in the middle of his parents' divorce, and Walter (John Mahoney), a successful CEO who is suffering from insomnia.  In addition, Paul continues his own therapy with Dr. Gina Toll (Dianne Weist).<br /><br />This half-hour, 5 times each week series from HBO may not be for everybody, but it is certainly one of the best written, acted and directed series on television (cable or otherwise) today.<br /><br />With a minimum of exceptions, the entire show is set in the offices of either Paul or Gina, as they hold their therapy sessions, thus each episode unfolds like a one-act play as the characters reveal more of their inner selves and turmoil.<br /><br />There are no action sequences, no CGI, just two (sometimes three or four) people talking about themselves, their relationships and their problems, some of which are probably not too far removed from our own.  That makes for riveting drama.<br /><br />I can't recommend this show too highly.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman

B0000DC14V|5.0|Too many customers have complained about the video quality of this movie.  It is not top quality, but that is because it has not been digitally remastered.  So this is the best that can be purchased.  And in truth, it is not bad.  It is very \\"watchable\\".  I enjoyed it without any complaints.  To top it off, this is one of the best westerns ever made.  Most westerns are corny and trite; not this one.

SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD-This specific animation involving everyones favorite Dark knight is one of the better releases in recent memory on par with the \\"Batman Beyond-Return of the Joker\\" animation from years back. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, the movie deals with the death and resurrection of a certain former Boy Wonder(Jason Todd) and his mission of vengeance against The Joker and his take no prisoners stance against crime in Gotham city. It's one of the better releases in DC's Animated movie line. A MUST HAVE!!!

B000I0QM0E|3.0|I share the frustration of other reviewers. This is not a great BluRay version. That is why I rate this product only 3 stars (not the movie). Picture looks grainy, it doesn't have a true HD feeling. Also, sound is not HD. They should have done a better job with this film. They should have added more extras (there are only 2 extras one of which is like behind-the-scenes documentary and the other is Legend Of Sleepy Hollow). They should have added HD sound and improved the picture quality. If you don't own Sleepy Hollow, you may buy it, but if you already have the standard DVD version, you may want to stay away.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|\\"Toy Story\\", the film that would earn animation company Pixar Animation Studios the reputation of being the finest animation studio in the world and would literally bring Walt Disney Studios to enter new generation of animated films created entirely in CGI but also would earn the love and praise not only from the critics but the fans who wanted more and more.<br /><br />Released in 1995 and budgeted at $30 million, the first film would go on to make $351 million worldwide (and still making money with the recent Blu-ray release).<br /><br />In November 1999, the sequel \\"Toy Story 2\\" was released in theaters and the $90 million dollar film like its predecessor did extremely well in the domestic and worldwide box office making over $485 million.<br /><br />But it has been more than a decade since the release of a \\"Toy Story\\" film and 15 years since the first film, fans have been clamoring for a new \\"Toy Story\\" film and sure enough, Disney/Pixar released the third and final film of the trilogy, \\"Toy Story 3\\" in June 2010 and not only did it surpass the box office returns of the first two films combined, earning over 1 billion dollars, the second Disney film to earn over a billion after \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" (also released in 2010).<br /><br />\\"Toy Story 3\\" literally shattered box office records and became the 5th highest grossing film of all time worldwide and the 9th highest grossing film in the US (and obviously the highest grossing film of 2010) and is an ultimate success for Disney/Pixar.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />When I watched \\"Toy Story 1\\" and \\"Toy Story 2\\", I easily noticed how CGI had improved between 1995 and 1999, especially with how fabric started to show more detail and we started to see more of a surface to Mr. Potato Head and T-Rex.<br /><br />But \\"Toy Story 3\\", eleven years later, you would expect CGI to take a dramatic leap forward and needless to say, \\"Toy Story 3\\" is visually impressive.<br /><br />Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio), the first thing you notice with \\"Toy Story 3\\" are the vibrant colors and then overall detail.  Everything shows detail and as we learn from this Blu-ray release, the animators wanted to make sure that the characters themselves do not look like toys, that they wanted to make sure the characters and toys are distinguished and the animators succeeded in every way possible.<br /><br />Mr. Potato Head, you literally see the surface like the actual toy, down to its seams.  Look at the hardwood floors in Andy's room, so much detail on the floor that it looks realistic, even some outdoor scenes look photorealistic (especially the animation and CG shown during Lotso's past, wow!).  And the fabric of the clothing, you can see the threading, the weaves and how much detail went into the clothing. One scene with the monkey, it looks like a stuffed monkey with its detail, the detail of it's clothing and scary eyes, these models look fantastic!  Also, see the dirt and grime on the animals, that was awesome how they captured that in the film.<br /><br />The hair even was well-done, the wear and tear that the toys go through at Sunnyside Daycare is evident through the nicks and scratches and also looking at Andy's trunk and seeing the little chips on the trunk to the paint and we can see the brush strokes on the walls, \\"Toy Story 3\\" just looks magnificent on Blu-ray and I don't see how any videophile can say anything negative about how this film looks on Blu-ray.<br /><br />And facial expressions of the human characters such as Andy, his sister, his mother to Bonnie, these were well-animated and rendered.<br /><br />I did notice some banding but times I did see it were short.  For example, when Woody is back at Sunnyside, he is holding the red phone receiver and the banding is evident in that one scene but again, the scenes you do see it are seconds long and does not distract you from how fantastic this film looks.<br /><br />This is the best looking Disney/Pixar film to date!  Vibrant, detailed and everything about the picture quality is going to make videophiles swoon!  It's that impressive and easily a reference quality Blu-ray release for picture quality!<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1).<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Toy Story 3 \\" is presented in English 7.1 DTS Master Audio and English 5.1 DTS Master Audio.  Also, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital EX is included as well as English 2.0 DVS.<br /><br />All I can say is that \\"Toy Story 3' sounds magnificent.  The first action scenes that startoff the film will show you how awesome this film sounds in lossless.  From Mrs. Potato Head's voice coming from the surround channels, sounds coming from the rear surround channels, LFE being utilized for the evil Dr. Porkchop's laser beam or when Mr. Potato Head has Slinky Dog turn on its force field and Jesse calling on T-Rex, this is just impressive to hear the sound coming from all channels.<br /><br />Dialogue is crystal clear and music is just as clear!  And you then hear how the sound is utilized during the children's rush to get the toys as they slam them all over the place, the garbage dump as everything is being compacted and you can hear flames pattering, the garbage truck coming from the distance, tiny footstep sounds throughout the room... really, there are so many sounds that are well-utilized throughout this film, it's very impressive!  Sure, the film is not 100% action-based but action and non-action scenes, the film sounds fantastic on Blu-ray and I didn't even notice a lot of these sounds at the theater when I watched this film this past summer.<br /><br />So, you really experience a  great, immersive soundscape with \\"Toy Story 3' from all channels, especially via LFE. Not only is picture quality hitting the high marks for reference quality, the lossless audio is just as magnificent and audiophiles should be happy with this Blu-ray release as well!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.  For the special features, some extras have other subtitles included.<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital EX and 2.0 DVS.

The digital copy of the feature film works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.  Also, a slip over cover comes with this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I'm sure that \\"Toy Story 3\\" hit people a lot harder emotionally than some viewers.  Some look at it as the next level of wonderful CGI graphics for Disney/Pixar animated films, others look at the film as another successful film for the studio but I'm going to go even farther and say that this film caught my attention, not because I grew up with the previous two films but the fact is that like the character of Andy, during my late teens, it was time to say goodbye to all the toys that I once owned.<br /><br />Memories of having friends overnight to play with these toys, memories of opening the old department store catalogs and hoping my grandparents would get me the latest toy that I picked out and then to open it in Christmas morning.  Suffice to say, when it came to my toys... I was very fortunate to have such a memorable time playing with them and having caring family to help support that habit.  But unlike Andy, I did not have the moment to say goodbye, it was more like, turn 16 and my parents made the conscious decision to throw out all my toys and force me to sell all my comic books and prepare for graduation and SAT tests and so forth.<br /><br />Needless to say, it was not necessarily a traumatic moment but it was a defining moment...OK, who am I kidding, it was one of the saddest moments in my life.<br /><br />So, \\"Toy Story 3\\" for me, was just a magnificent film that took me back to those old days of playing in my room and like Andy, having these wild adventures that I could conjure in my head and sooner or later, we grow older, become interested in different things and sooner or later, we say goodbye and prepare for our next stage in our lives as young adults.<br /><br />I watched this film knowing that it was going to be successful and along with my wife, my son and my nephew, watched it in 3D the first day it came to theater.  But watching it on Blu-ray, without the usual audience distractions, my experience this time around was heightened.  Watching \\"Toy Story 3\\" in 1080p, I was amazed by how vibrant the film looked, how much detail was showcased.  From the little tears in Andy's toy chest, the clothing of the characters, the dirt and grime on the toys, the wonderful lossless audio and then for me to watch the special features in three days because there are a good number of them included, I can't help but feel that this is truly a perfect release.<br /><br />Yes, I am sure the videophiles will say there was banding on the picture quality but those banding moments were few and were short.  Really, everything you love about the film, you get that and more in the \\"Toy Story 3: 4-Disc Combo Pack\\". It's important for people to know that if you don't need the accompanying DVD or the digital copy, you can also purchase the Blu-ray two-disc version as well.<br /><br />Personally, I can't find one significant flaw with this Blu-ray release.  There is something for everyone in this release, may you be a fan of the film, a person wanting to learn about the animation business and learn from the awesome team at Pixar, there is just so much to love about this release that it's definitely one of the top 10 Blu-ray releases of 2010 and that is pretty tough as this year alone had many significant releases, especially coming from Disney.  If anything, Walt Disney continues to raise the bar for its Blu-ray releases and I suppose since this is finale farewell for the \\"Toy Story\\" series (which I would imagine is not set in stone because \\"Toy Story\\" made an insane amount of money for Disney and \\"Toy Story 3\\" made over a billion dollars worldwide, I just can't see this being a 100% final farewell), they had to go out with a bang for this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Toy Story 3\\" is a film in which Pixar continues to their reign of innovation, their mark on quality of beautifully animated films and a well-written storyline that just pulls you in.  The Blu-ray release is not just for those who love \\"Toy Story 3\\" but for those who loved the \\"Toy Story\\" trilogy.  If you loved the first two films, then this is a no-brainer, this is a must-buy release.<br /><br />\\"Toy Story 3: 4-Disc Combo Pack\\" is magnificent and is a true 5-star release!

1416585710|5.0|I am so surprised by the bad reviews of this book! It is a story that has stuck in my head since I read it two years ago. I loved and really enjoyed reading it and I enjoy thinking of it afterwards. I liked it lots!
B000683VI4|5.0|I love this movie and I can watch it over and over.  I think every good thing has already been mentioned by other reviewers.  The main thing that made it so beautiful to me was their love even at their age.  In our current times where divorce is rampant, love that lasts til death is something that should be so cherished.
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|Perfect Chemistry is a wonderful story, I loved reading it. The story is about two high school seniors from two very different lifestyles who fall in love despite their differences.<br /><br />Brittany Ellis has the perfect life from the outside - she is beautiful, rich and popular at school. However, her home life is not a fairy tale. Her older sister has major health problems which she helps out with as much as possible because her parents can't seem to deal with her. Her mother has anxiety issues and expects Brittany to put forth a perfect image at all times while her father is always working. Brittany also has the perfect football player boyfriend to complete her image who she didn't see over the summer only to find things strained when school begins.<br /><br />Alejandro Fuentes is a Latino man from the south side of town. He is the man of his house, taking care of his two younger brothers and his mother. His secret wish is to get out of the violent lifestyle he lives and go to college but he knows that isn't possible for him. He joined the Latino Bloods gang to protect his family because he had no choice, now he is stuck because you don't just walk away from a gang - you either die or wish you would have died if you tried to leave. Alex refuses to deal drugs but he does have to collect money from people and resort to violence, which is all he has known on his side of town.<br /><br />On the first day of class, Alex and Brittany get into a clash before school over a parking lot incident. Then they are both in the same chemistry class and are assigned to work together as partners. Alex thinks Brittany is a fake white b*tch, while she thinks he is a scary druggie gang member so they don't exactly hit it off. Alex makes a bet with a friend that he can sleep with Brittany before Thanksgiving, so he decides to try to seduce her. As they start to get to know each other, Alex and Brittney find that despite outside appearances, they have a lot in common. They both hide behind a fake persona they created, Alex as a tough gang banger and Brittany as a perfect popular girl.<br /><br />Alex and Brittany are both attracted to each other but Brittany has her perfect football player boyfriend. She is very attracted to Alex but doesn't see how they could be together. She eventually gets the courage to go after what she wants in life instead of maintaining a façade, so she dumps her boyfriend and goes after Alex. Her feelings aren't one-sided but Alex lives a dangerous lifestyle that he isn't sure Brittney should be anywhere near. He starts to think maybe he can actually graduate and hope for a future but he doesn't see a way out of the gang lifestyle he is stuck in. Brittany believes in him and thinks he can have a great future, but getting out just may kill him.<br /><br />I loved this story! I was so engrossed in this Romeo and Juliet style romance. Alex was a very sexy Latino man, he was a good man despite his violent background. He didn't want to be in a gang but was stuck because he lived in a dangerous place and needed to protect his family. I liked Brittany too, I was a little annoyed with her when she didn't break up with her boyfriend right away when he was being a jerk then I remembered how long I stayed with my jerk high school boyfriend and realized we have all been young and dumb. I was impressed when Brittany threw caution to the wind and went after Alex, accepting the fact he was in a gang but wanting better for him because she knew he could do better.<br /><br />I loved how the author didn't water things down, the characters seemed very realistic. The gang lifestyle shown was gritty, dangerous and scary but she managed to show the different facets of it. She also showed the Latino culture in great detail which I enjoyed. None of the characters were two-dimensional, they all had layers to their personalities. Tough guy Alex had a vulnerable side and there was a funny scene where his buddy spilled something on his pants that made it look like he peed himself. I also like how the high school seniors drank alcohol at parties, had sex and occasionally smoked weed - because that is realistic for the setting, I hate when people act like it doesn't happen.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book! I loved reading about Alex and Brittany, it's a story I won't forget anytime soon and plan on reading again. Alex was a great character, who can resist a bad boy with a good heart and the good girl who won't give up on him. Don't be worried about the Young Adult label, these two are very mature for their ages. There is one love scene that is not very detailed but the story is full of sexual tension and hot chemistry between the leads. There is an HEA at the end of the book, we know they are going to be together and it makes sense for their age and place in life. The story is told in first person from both points of view, which actually worked wonderfully since the author is very talented.so like how the high school seniors drank alcohol at parties, had sex and occasionally smoked weed - because that is realistic for the setting, I hate when people act like it doesn't happen.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|\\"The Sound of Music\\", the 1965 20th Century Fox musical which would capture the world with its memorable music and it's touching storyline and continues to have thrived through various generations and will continue to thrive for many generations hereafter.<br /><br />The film is an adaptation of a popular Broadway play which is based on the memoir \\"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\\" written by Maria von Trapp.  The von Trapp family are known for escaping from the Nazis in Austria after the Anschluss (the annexation and occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938).<br /><br />The original musical based on the book featured music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II (both Rodgers and Hammerstein were known for their music for \\"Oklahoma!\\", \\"Carousel\\", \\"State Fair\\", \\"South Pacific\\", \\"The King and I\\" to name a few) which led to the book by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse.  The Broadway production began in 1959 starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel and would later inspire a film adaptation in 1965 which was loosely based on the Broadway production and memoir.<br /><br />The film would become an ultimate success as director Robert Wise (known for \\"West Side Story\\" and \\"The Haunting\\") would win five Academy Awards for Best Director, William Reynolds for Best Film Editing, Irwin Kostal for Best Music, Scoring of Music, Adaptation or Treatment, Best Picture and Best Sound.<br /><br />The film would be best known for its wonderful location of Salzburg, Austria (which has inspired an actual \\"Sound of Music\\" tour which has been functional for the last 30-years) but most of all, known for its music which include \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"Edelweiss\\", \\"My Favorite Things\\", \\"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\\" and \\"Do-Re-Mi\\".<br /><br />The film which was budgeted at $8.2 million would go on to gross $163 million worldwide.  The film would break the record held by \\"Gone with the Wind\\" for box office revenue and would also be a film that would be in circulation in theaters for three straight years.<br /><br />\\"The Sound of Music\\" would also continue to become a hit on video as it was released as a five star DVD release in 2000 to celebrate the film's 35th Anniversary, released in 2005 to celebrate the film's 40th Anniversary and now in 2010 on Blu-ray, a limited edition box set and a digital iTunes release to celebrate the film's 45th Anniversary.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:20:1), AVC@22 MBPS.  This is where \\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\" literally looks amazing.  For those who have owned previous versions of the film on DVD, back in 2005, the film went through restoration using a backup negative of the original 70 mm print.  At the time, the original 70mm 6-Track print was so damaged, there was no way to even use the original negative at that time and most of us who watched the 40th Anniversary Edition felt that the film looked absolutely beautiful compared to it's earlier 2000 DVD release.<br /><br />With that being said, technology has changed within the last five years since the release of the 40th Anniversary.  The damaged original 70 mm print that couldn't be used in the restoration of the film in 2005 can now be used for the film with new hardware and software and is now receiving 8K digital scanning by 20th Century Fox for perfect restoration.<br /><br />No longer is the film hazy, no longer is the film more on the pinkish side.  \\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\" is vibrant.  The grass...you can see the various grains of grass, the strands in green, yellow and detail of the mountains over looking Salzburg.  I was amazed!  Another example, Maria splashing the water before she heads to the von Trapps, you can see the water droplets flying in the air, another one is the von Trapp's uncle and his coat, you can see the wool in his jacket.  There is so much detail in this latest version of \\"The Sound of Music\\", it's incredible!  I am literally speechless because I own previous versions of this film on video and never before have I seen this much clarity in the film ever!<br /><br />And I find it quite funny for each review I have done for the film, I mention of how the cinematography of William Reynolds was captured perfectly but watching it on Blu-ray, the cinematography... may it be the shots of Maria on the mountain, Maria with the kids on the mountain, the wedding ceremony, etc., I just feel that the cinematography as seen on the 45th Anniversary Edition via the new restoration really captures the beauty of \\"The Sound of Music\\" than ever before.  Absolutely breathtaking!<br /><br />Once again, the crew who restored this film...I give your crew a standing ovation...what you were able to accomplish with this film on Blu-ray is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 4.0 Dolby Surround, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS.  Because the film was shot with a 6-track and because they were provided with the audio without the dialogue, for this 2010 edition, they were able to remove all noise but also making sure to utilize a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and as mentioned, I've owned several versions of this film and I even own the soundtrack to this film.<br /><br />The way this music was handled through the surround channels was amazing.  The music and the instruments playing on individual channels was well done.  The first thing that came to my mind during sequences of the sisters singing \\"Maria\\" to the wedding sequence, the sounds that were utilized through those channels were amazing.  Also, they were able to isolate the sound of Salzburg up the hills, the sound of wind, the birds... I was in awe with the lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />I absolutely love the soundtrack for this film and this is the best I have ever heard of it.  If you have a 7.1 setup (center speaker, two fronts, two surrounds, two rear surrounds and your subwoofer), you will definitely be impressed with how alive the music comes as it really sounds beautiful via the soundscape in the home.  Once again, I was in awe when I heard the music and I'm sure many people will be just as impressed by it.<br /><br />Similar to the video restoration, the audio restoration for this 45th anniversary is fantastic!  And the crew responsible for the audio restoration for this release should be proud because they did an outstanding job!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\" comes with the following special features from the 35th and 40th Anniversary DVD versions of the film but also newer special features that just literally packs this 45th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray release:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Your Favorite Things: An Interactive Celebration - A new way to watch \\"The Sound of Music\\".

Audio in English 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, English 4.0 Dolby Surround, Spanish Dolby Surround and French Dolby Surround.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish. Also, included is a slip-over cover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I literally grew up in a household where \\"The Sound of Music\\" played and to tell you the truth, when I was younger, I really couldn't stand the musical as my mother would sing the songs over and over again.  But as I got older and I began watching more classic films, I found myself watching \\"The Sound of Music\\" around 1990 or so and I ended up purchasing the soundtrack for the film on cassette.  When I visited my mother, I ended up playing the cassette and in a very long time, I heard her sing the songs once again.<br /><br />When I got married, I was amazed that my wife knew the lyrics also by heart and by the birth of our son, to help calm him, she would sing \\"My Favorite Things\\".  Needless to say, the music of \\"The Sound of Music\\" has been part of me during my childhood and I have no doubt that with my wife and son, it will continue on to the next generation.<br /><br />As for the film, I have watched and owned various incarnations of this film on video and I have purchased the five star edition of the movie on DVD in 2000 and I clearly felt that the 40th Anniversary 2005 release was just unprecedented.  I felt that it was the ultimate release and I figured, if it was on Blu-ray, it would be an HD version of the film and the same special features.  But I was wrong.  Twentieth Century Fox has given fans of the film the ultimate release with \\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\".<br /><br />Not only do we get another restoration of the film using the original 70 mm negative and now presented in 1080p High Definition, we get a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack which sounds incredible!  Just the fact that the film looks and sounds better is significant.  The colors just pop!  It's hard to describe of how awesome this film looks on Blu-ray compared to previous video releases.  In the past, there was always this dreamy, hazy look to the film.  Though it was colorful, I have always thought that was how the film was shot.  And the opening scene with Julie Andrews on top of the hill spinning around, I always thought that was a beautiful shot... that was until I saw this 45th Anniversary Edition and everything that I have thought about the look of the film has went out the window because this presentation is just amazing!  I felt the old colors always had a greenish/pinkish tinge but now, the colors look accurate.  Blue skies look vibrantly blue and no pinkish haze on the background.  Grass and hills are still green but now we can see the strands of grass quite clearly, more than ever before.<br /><br />The blues of Julie Andrews and Charmian Carr's eyes just captures your attention, the detail of Captain von Trapp's home or the clothing is detail that is much more cleaner and more evident than ever before.  Only one time in the film is where things do look a bit faux is when the Captain, the Baroness and Uncle Max are driving and of course, you see the usual fake background and that scene, you're not going to get much realism but for the most part, the film looks amazing.<br /><br />And as mentioned, the sound...I've listened to this soundtrack so many times but to hear it in 7.1 and hear of how the instruments were carefully selected for various channels, for those who have a 7.1 setup, you can't help but be happy of how nice this soundtrack comes in DTS-HD!  Again, awesome!<br /><br />And just when you think that was it, there are literally hours and hours of special features included in this release of \\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\".  It took me two days or so just to go through everything and watch everything and once again, I thought the 40th Anniversary Edition was significant, but this 45th Anniversary edition just blows it out of the water.  Various documentaries, commentary, various featuretttes, audio interviews and more!  And I can't even imagine what 20th Century Fox will do for the 50th Anniversary Edition but I do have one request and that would be to record the live sing-along for the film and give people a chance to select it as an optional soundtrack to watch the film and sing-along with those thousands of people (like the 18,000 or so that showed up to the Hollywood Bowl).  That would be awesome!<br /><br />And I need to go back to the restoration and to say that if Twentieth Century Fox now has the technology in 2010 to take damaged negatives and are able to repair it to the point where they can re-use the film for a master in a Blu-ray release, that literally makes me extremely giddy and happy because that means a lot of those wonderful classic films in their catalog can receive a wonderful Blu-ray release using this technology.  I'm very impressed with this release and I look forward to the potential of what this can mean for classic films on Blu-ray from Twentieth Century Fox.<br /><br />With that being said, for the very hardcore fans of \\"The Sound of Music\\", for this 45th Anniversary release, you also have the opportunity to get the Limited Collector's set packaged in a keepsake box and features a 100-page \\"My Favorite Things\\" scrapbook, a 45th Anniversary Soundtrack, a reproduction of the original 1965 souvenir program, an exclusive handpainted \\"My Favorite Things\\" music box and more.  And for those people who prefer all things digital, on November 2nd will also include a digital release on iTunes of \\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\" which includes a sing-along version of the movie and 180-minutes of behind-the-scenes material.<br /><br />Once again, I was shocked when I watched this release because I had no idea how much went into the restoration of the film for this 45th Anniversary edition because they just did one for the 40th Anniversary.  But the fact that they have the technology and that they were given a chance to do give this film a new restoration using the latest technology was impressive.  The addition of all this bonus material for the Blu-ray release is magnificent and the fact that this entire Blu-ray release of \\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\" just raises the bar of what a studio can accomplish for a classic film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic release of \\"The Sound of Music\\" and if you are a big fan, whether you get this version or the Limited Edition version, all I can say is that this is the definitive version to own that just stands out from its previous video releases in quality and quantity.  Great music, great story, musical performances, cinematography and just a wonderful family film.  Sure, it may be a bit too saccharine sweet for today's audience (or too long) but for those who have never watched this film ever, please give it a try.<br /><br />This is a perfect release in every category and easily deserving of five stars!  \\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\" is highly recommended!From Liesl to Gretl - (33:33) A reunion of the seven talents who play the Von Trapp children in the film talking about their experience working on the film, hijinks behind-the-camera and mistakes they made that are on the film.<br />  5.

But the fact that they have the technology and that they were given a chance to do give this film a new restoration using the latest technology was impressive.  The addition of all this bonus material for the Blu-ray release is magnificent and the fact that this entire Blu-ray release of \\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\" just raises the bar of what a studio can accomplish for a classic film.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic release of \\"The Sound of Music\\" and if you are a big fan, whether you get this version or the Limited Edition version, all I can say is that this is the definitive version to own that just stands out from its previous video releases in quality and quantity.  Great music, great story, musical performances, cinematography and just a wonderful family film.  Sure, it may be a bit too saccharine sweet for today's audience (or too long) but for those who have never watched this film ever, please give it a try.<br /><br />This is a perfect release in every category and easily deserving of five stars!  \\"The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition\\" is highly recommended!
0061715050|5.0|*****<br /><br />I was happy to hold a hardcover with Pauline Baynes' illustrations. The font is good, the pages of good quality, and it made re-reading this classic a warming experience.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed re-reading this book in light of Michael Ward's [[ASIN:1414339658 The Narnia Code: C. S. Lewis and the Secret of the Seven Heavens]], which has helped me appreciate all the more the rich and subtle messages of this classic, Christianity-permeated fairy tale.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this edition. It's worth the couple of extra bucks.<br /><br />*****
B00275EHJG|5.0|No need for me to review this movie -- you're buying it because you know it was (or will be) good.<br /><br />However, it is worth the effort to point out that this arrived in frustration-free packaging from Amazon.  Only celophane wrapped.  No uber adhesive keeping that celophane vacuum packed to the DVD box.  No annoying stickers on top of the box, or on the side.  No silly plastic flaps to open the DVD box.<br /><br />+1 for Amazon!
B00005JLO2|4.0|I got this and Zulu for my husband for a belated birthday, I had been looking for them for awhile, they are now his most watched movies....
B003JSSPSY|5.0|great acting, awesome characters,love the storyline , i'd advise everyone to watch it. my advice is 2 keep these movies coming!
0553805371|2.0|Having finished \\"The Grand Design\\" by Stephen Hawking, I can truthfully say that it is FULL of absurd & naive assertions, it is disingenuous in its assessment of theism, it logically contradicts itself in places, the conclusions don't follow from the premises, & his interpretations of reality is sadly science fiction. It ends up being Physics + Naturalism + Postmodernism. A truly embarrassing piece of work. I only gave it two stars for the cool pictures, lol.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Love this album, each song feels fresh and the whole thing is great from start to finish!
1416589473|5.0|Absolute great book.  Lost many hours of sleep because I simply couldn't put it down.  Definitely was interesting to read more about the lore of Guild Wars but you don't have to play through all the campaigns to understand what is going on.  I'm waiting anxiously for the next book and will get it the moment it comes out.
B0043X7WLA|5.0|He's taken us through the States of Michigan and Illinois - studiously, charmingly, unflagging graciousness all the way - and now Sufjan Stevens has radically revised the itinerary for an unforeseen intergalactic launch to uncharted destinations, to a place that might just have to be called \\"The State of My Heart\\".  And it's a territory at least as expansive as the imagined Universe, apparently.<br /><br />A long track-by-track appreciation follows, but here's the bottom line:  THE AGE OF ADZ is a concept album that takes as its subject the human experience of that one greatest thing that remains:  Love.  Awkward enough to type that out here as an anonymous reviewer, but Sufjan Stevens the artist has gone and built a veritable public monument of an album around it, on it, with it, from it, to it, for it.<br /><br />And he really has done it proper, inside and out, backwards and forwards, with his heart hanging out.<br /><br />From inner space of the Soul to outer space of the Cosmos, this album is an aural and conceptual collision of scale worthy of the task that it meets head-on.  And it's crafted and sequenced with more discipline and unfaltering intuition than might be apparent from cursory and piecemeal assessments.  For the commission that it has taken on (Cher auto-tunes it to you from the year 1998: \\"Do you belieeeve in life after love?\\"), this record arrives whole, a clear dispatch from some very far-flung outposts.<br /><br />So here we go, a Lonely Planet overview of the trip I took on THE AGE OF ADZ:<br /><br />\\"FUTILE DEVICES\\" is, for a melodist and lyricist of Sufjan's gifts and abilities, essentially a throwaway, and definitely a throwback.  As opening track, though, it's in the right place as a kind of dedication and epigram:  scrapbook mementos of friendship & intimacy, scrawled memories of warmth, tucked away in a safe place, close to the body, before launching off into deep-freeze outer limits.<br /><br />And a beleaguered lyricist's frank admission, right up front:  \\"words are futile devices\\".<br /><br />\\"TOO MUCH\\" opens the concept album proper with synthesizer squelches like a baptism of primordial slime.  Something's definitely changing, mutation looks to be inevitable - but it's impossible to assess or prevent damage while sloshing around in this predicament.  So this track, along with the two that follow, thematically and collectively sound like valiant Boy Scout attempts at speedy extrication and escape.  Both the smartest and the dumbest move, and all perfectly necessary, perhaps, at this emotional juncture.<br /><br />\\"TOO MUCH\\" plays like a State of the Union address on Love's falling out, growing progressively tenser and more serious as it proceeds.  The war is definitely on and we're being forced to take it into outer space - plans and coordinates are on the screen for your review.<br /><br />But all such formalities and strategies are prematurely and effectively blasted to Kingdom Come when the next track, \\"AGE OF ADZ\\", sneaks into the control room on four computer beeps and just pushes the button:  a bombastic Apocalypse of Love's recriminations, existential panic escalating into too-hasty grasping at always-imminent Transcendence, ending only with more mournful explanations and self-recriminations - alone with a banjo, crouched, maybe, in a bomb shelter.  And if that sounds like a real pretentious and overloaded assessment, it's more or less what this track merits.  Overblown and precarious, it also makes perfect conceptual and emotional sense in its place and context.<br /><br />With such grand and necessary meltdowns out of the way (for the time being), \\"I WALKED\\" is the track that soberly straightens itself out in the mirror and gets ready for its ostensible swan song.  A heartrending and dignified farewell performance, attractive in the measured sadness of its earnest grievances, this is the point at which most well-meaning friends would administer warm hugs and admiring pats on the back, fire off text message salutes, all in praise of emotional maturity, courage and honesty, and what else have you.<br /><br />And at this stage, a still-aching, heart-wounded soul would be dazed and weakened enough to really want to believe all that.<br /><br />And it is also from here on that THE AGE OF ADZ, to these critical ears, starts to become really interesting and involving.  The early stages of network consultation and public demonstration done, whoever now pushes on, pushes on alone, by dint of sheer emotional fortitude and crack intuition.<br /><br />In terms of songwriting craft and production polish, the next track, \\"NOW THAT I'M OLDER\\", along with \\"BAD COMMUNICATION\\", is one of the few obvious bummers on the album.  Titled as a coming-of-age number, it seems to convey that process as a kind of slow spiritual diffusion into the ether, a really depressed and melodramatic emotional wallow, in other words.<br /><br />These two lesser tracks, however, appropriately represent the emotional nadirs of the album's song-cycle, and they serve their purpose well in repetitious and desultory melodies, prosaic and scattershot lyrics, dragging tempos and haphazard production.  Thematically, they sound like the sad diminishing returns of long shut-in days.  And also significantly, they come on either end of what is arguably the album's masterpiece, track six, \\"GET REAL GET RIGHT\\".<br /><br />There's that old religious adage about the Almighty being near to those poor and lowly in spirit, and on the fantastic \\"GET REAL GET RIGHT\\" - which opens with fat beats overlaid with the sound of syncopated human hiccups, like someone finally regaining his breath after a bout of terrible weeping - it's as if the drawn-out days of an aimless depression have been graciously interrupted by decree of some truly divine intervention.  In sudden wakefulness, certain veils are lifted, all the necessary lenses float and align in place, and like that old Television song says, \\"My eyes are like telescopes\\".<br /><br />The lyrics risk preachy grandstanding in their telegraphic prophesying, but \\"GET REAL GET RIGHT\\" powers past such pitfalls by the heat of genuine moral conviction, the press of personal culpability.  The performance here is totally committed, the production bang-on, and incredibly enough, the whole thing seems to accomplish exactly what it set out to do, something like a heat-seeking missile compared to the mistimed A-bomb of \\"AGE OF ADZ\\" a few tracks earlier.  The synthesizers at the thunderous climax are excellently deployed, mixed to maximum effectiveness, like heavenly mecha robots wreaking righteous havoc across morally torpid metropolises the world over.<br /><br />All in all, this track is just unimpeachable, the moral and spiritual centre of an album whose concept could not have held so strongly without this kind of lightning rod of conviction.<br /><br />But then, because no mortal can indefinitely sustain himself at such levels of blazing prophetic inspiration, there comes the severe and necessary comedown of \\"BAD COMMUNICATION\\", with opening synths like platypus farts and lyrics aptly demonstrating the relational breakdown of its title:  one-sided conversations with a person suddenly a stranger, sharing no such moral or spiritual compunctions, middle-of-the-night convictions breaking down in the bleak light of the workaday rush.<br /><br />And so, on \\"VESUVIUS\\", the fledgling prophet's mantle is set aside for the recovery of that more familiar calling - artist & composer - and Sufjan Stevens slowly rouses himself through a kind of musical pep talk, one that also seems to have been conceived as a dirge for his own funeral.  He's rather dragging his feet to the task that still lies ahead.  Because any prophet or artist worth his salt knows that the expressed truth he aims for - prophetic, artistic, or otherwise - will effectively injure his own self before landing with any clarity or conviction in the ears and hearts of his listeners.  And then, hopefully, the healing reply of vindication, redemption.<br /><br />Sample lyric:  \\"Why does it have to be so hard?\\"<br /><br />The next two tracks, \\"ALL FOR MYSELF\\" and \\"I WANT TO BE WELL\\", close out the album's first long section (before the 25-minute suite that is \\"IMPOSSIBLE SOUL\\") and they also introduce a level of carnality and profanity not previously encountered in the Sufjan Stevens catalogue.  The artist here is digging deep, into genuinely subconscious grounds as well as those intentionally obscured, and the results are appropriately discomfiting, upsetting and stirring.  If, someday, someone, in the eggheaded spirit of this long album review, should undertake a book-length critical study entitled \\"Sufjan's Vision of Sin\\", these two tracks will be the early go-to texts.  They signal the kind of wholly unexpected but then entirely coherent artistic development that harks back and links up to previous works while marking a decisive departure from and qualification of same.<br /><br />So if that very lovely, lyrical yarn about predatory wasps and best boyhood friends from Illinois days was something like Sufjan's \\"We Two Boys Together Clinging\\", \\"ALL FOR MYSELF\\" here sounds like a dark thematic extraction from \\"Calamus\\", that cycle of poems wherein good gray Walt Whitman knits his brow and broods that \\"an athlete is enamoured of me - and I of him\\", but \\"toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me, eligible to burst forth\\".  Hairy chests replace youthful limbs wet from the swim, and the whole song is frankly orgasmic in conception and execution, all shuddering starts and stops and shifting rhythms before another ride on the cresting, crashing crescendos of the chorus proper.<br /><br />(\\"All For Myself\\":  about as succinct and forthright a motto as any about the need, sometimes, to just get there.  And, as with Whitman, it isn't entirely clear if the \\"there\\" of this sensual and ritualized camaraderie entails actual physical consummation, or some other kind of metaphysical transportation vivid and gripping enough to boggle and confuse the flesh into chaste credulity.  For the always disciplined but constantly ravenous soul of the lifelong artist, fixedly attuned to the quality of rarefied experience, probably a prudent but potent mix of both, with an unmistakable tip toward the latter.)<br /><br />As for the bouncy and manic and altogether traumatic \\"I WANT TO BE WELL\\", let us now think back for a moment to Michigan days, to the shimmering, reverent tones of \\"O GOD, WHERE ARE YOU NOW?\\", with Sufjan pondering the resurrection of the dead and earnestly wondering, \\"Would my body stay the same?\\"  And so now, in this new song, thrashing madly against the living-nightmare effects of \\"the pill or demon / As my body changes\\", it really seems as good a time as any to break out the serious profanity, if only to let the oppressor know that this is one body that won't be going down without a fight.<br /><br />This track speaks of irreparably altered hopes and dreams, terrible abuses and betrayals of trust, and the desperate, too-late realization that mind & body & heart & soul are of a single human piece, and that to lose or forfeit even one of these to theft or treachery is to somehow become bereft of it all, both temporarily and permanently, in differing ways.<br /><br />Who's to say how far Sufjan Stevens has had to go to such places personally and actually?  But as an artist and writer of songs, at the very least, this track demonstrates that Sufjan Stevens has arrived at a place where he is able to both explicitly and elliptically convey a more sprawling and visceral kind of human empathy than when he was crafting sensitive if shrewdly appointed narratives about desolate middle-aged citizens who drive busted-up snowmobiles and shop at the K-Mart.  That particular difference, from this vantage point, seems like the difference between a gifted literary man and a real brotherly witness.<br /><br />As faras track sequencing goes, this album is going to work really well on double LP, potentially an even more interactively emotional experience on turntable than on CD or MP3.  Because after the rave-up and freak-out of \\"I WANT TO BE WELL\\", a moment's pause and quiet reflection would only serve to heighten the plangent gorgeousness of the opening minutes of \\"IMPOSSIBLE SOUL\\", the long and varied track that waits on the other side of the vinyl.<br /><br />Opening with tentative, evenly paced keyboard tones, the song starts out like someone getting back up on shaky legs, taking deliberate but cautious steps toward recovered mobility.  And while I've usually demurred from fawning critics' talk about Sufjan's \\"gorgeous vocals\\" and especially his \\"delicate falsetto\\", what Sufjan the singer does here in the opening section of \\"IMPOSSIBLE SOUL\\" is touched, I think, by something like technical and spiritual transcendence, word and performance pouring out together like the very marrow of a human soul.  The only dramatic equivalent I can pull up, really, is Gena Rowlands in the movie A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE, coming home to loved ones after the breakdown that saw her signed off to a long stay at the institution.<br /><br />Open your heart and mind; lend even a little bit of your imagination, emotion and free-association to the opening minutes of this track (and to every minute that comes after, for that matter), and your experience and understanding of THE AGE OF ADZ might well be transformed for you right there.  This is the sound of Love being calmly and confidently affirmed even in the passing of its accustomed realities, with the hard-earned knowledge that Love really is that one thing that can only be defended by an absolute lack of defenses.<br /><br />And when that first distorted guitar/synth break kicks in, like an injured mecha robot trying hard to juice it for just one last mission, with an attendant chorus of sympathetic angels blessing the effort even as they gently relieve it of a wasting struggle, the whole thing doesn't just soar on a musical level, it also attains a kind of thematic resplendence that hovers and spreads out over the album's concept as a whole.  It's not just the most beautifully realized moment of THE AGE OF ADZ but perhaps of Sufjan Stevens' entire oeuvre to date.  And, really, for all that has gone before in this album, that's exactly how it should work:  a real artistic coup in the want of other needful forms of justice, a rare-enough consolation against the failures of just plain old human decency.<br /><br />The remaining twenty-some minutes of \\"IMPOSSIBLE SOUL\\" are largely successful, canny and affecting, and again, thematically coherent.  But the theme and concept here is the life that indeed goes on after Love's practical passing, with resultant words and music that are appropriately randomized and restless.  The Christian writer Oswald Chambers defines Love as \\"the outpouring of one personality in fellowship with another personality\\" (an explanation that might resound with particular profundity and poignancy only to those actually caught in the immediate thralls or throes of either finding or losing Love), and in the thematic absence and severance of such tender loving fellowship between human personalities joined in coupled mutuality, the latter sections of \\"IMPOSSIBLE SOUL\\" play out like an eclectic soundtrack to the far-flung wanderings of a modern solitary soul, subsisting on a largely indiscriminate diet of mass media information, pop culture reference, and an infinitely expanding catalogue of endlessly reproduced art and entertainment, all remotely accessed and never not available.  Maybe that's stretching it a bit, but in more mundane terms, something like a newly single person passively working through self-intuited psychotherapy while clicking through the 5,000 channels of digital satellite television.<br /><br />And so even after the assaultive optimism of a hyped-up and truly infectious group dance number (industrious amateurs the internet over are currently editing down the perfect five-minute track for their next humanist masterpiece of mass cooperation and collective giddiness), the sinister carnival synths and haunted house strings kick in and take over, and, at the risk of too much outrageousness, the slowed-down vocal track here may or may not be that large man beckoning from the doorway, standing there in his clown suit, insisting, \\"Boy, we can do much more together...\\"  Those are the bad places the mind goes, maybe, when it skips on sleep and opts for stupefaction, absorbing true-crime TV in the middle of the night.  The whole thing runs close to ending with a droning in the ears - like the sound of a depleted human conscience that has, indeed, allowed itself to be distracted.<br /><br />The epilogue tune cuts in right at the end, and it's a very pretty composition, though pointedly chilly in performance and with lyrics that potentially upset and reverse whole sections of that which came before.  Are these words and sentiments being presented detachedly, as Exhibit A extractions from a \\"Dear Sufjan\\" letter?  Or is the songwriter here faking some kind of unthinkable Borgesian narrative trick, he himself having been the primary scoundrel and heartbreaker all along?  Flip-flopping gender nouns will be keeping fangirls and fanboys squirrelly and guessing for some time yet.<br /><br />Man or woman, boy or girl, friend or lover.  And in any case, this closing performance projects hard and cold on the memory of that one someone who went out leaving the impression of a Sphinx - a gaze as blank and pitiless as the sun - and the artist here, now truly older in many ways, elects to bow out, at the end of this long commission, emulating same.<br /><br />Hats and caps off, kids.  Sufjan Stevens has really done it, with what looks to have taken planet-sized determination and commitment, returning with what might be, as a unified work of singular personal vision, a career-best to date.<br /><br />I didn't even consider how the Royal Robertson stuff might tie in with all this, and don't really plan to any time soon (aren't you glad and relieved?), but it's pretty obvious that this album has been much more than a \\"love & theft\\" kind of deal.  Concept or no concept, the premise and proposal are plain:  Sometimes you just have to make it personal, make it inevitable, no regrets, no looking back.  And no matter what else, whatever sights & whatever sounds:  Keep your heart & soul with you, all the way through, even after the end, dear Special Friend.<br /><br />And did I really have to go and post this entire ordeal here, taxing everyone's browser space, just inviting internet ire?  As an oversized counterpoint to some pretty curt dismissals also to be found around these here parts, yes.  For the ephemeral enjoyment of mouse-scrolling over a five-star rating, also yes.  And now, at the end, again yes, for the more substantial pleasure of concluding this honestly unforeseen writing, getting this truly uncanny record out of my system for a while, and to reiterate once more:  Five Stars, Sufjan Stevens.  Five Stars, and for an album like this, hitting a lot of us upside the heart and head, getting some of us back up on quicker, more nimble feet, for delivering it on this side of the new decade, Five Big Stars and the Moon as well.<br /><br />Be well, musical friends!enous soul of the lifelong artist, fixedly attuned to the quality of rarefied experience, probably a prudent but potent mix of both, with an unmistakable tip toward the latter.)

B002SSUQFG|5.0|The watch is very good and the second hand movement is really neat.     The only draw back is that it needs to be \\"charged\\" ie worn/shaken at least twice a day but not bad.
B003Y8YXH6|3.0|even a great remaster and a surprise stripped down version of the album has not changed the fact that Yoko's vocals are simply painful to listen to.  a better re-issue of the album would be to take John's vocals from this and milk and honey and make one album out of those songs.
B00138EZM2|5.0|Oh wow, I'd forgotten about this band for so many years, and was delighted to find it here on Amazon MP3. Oddly enough, after listening to all the demos, I found that the most oft-played Bangles hits were not my favorites! I only wanted these four tracks:<br /><br />Going Down To Liverpool<br />Walking Down Your Street<br />I\\"ll Set You Free<br />Everything I Wanted<br /><br />Oh sure, Egyptian, Monday, Flame, all good as well, but I have heard them a million times. These others were always in the back seat but in my opinion, they're what made the album really great!
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|The Mrs. and I just had a fantastic $14 nap.  Not since M. Night Shyamalamadingdong's \\"The Happening\\" have I been so utterly board in a movie.  In fact, I'd prefer to credit this journey into the mundane to him rather than the typically brilliant, Clint Eastwood.     Roger Ebert says, Clint Eastwood's \\"Hereafter\\" considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact. I was surprised to find it enthralling. I don't believe in woo-woo, but then neither, I suspect, does Eastwood. Enthralling?  I was begging for the French couple to break into a fit of rage and stab one another to death. Anything.  Something.      I tend to agree more with Kyle Smith of the New York Post who writes, The movie drags, yet it feels like it's missing an hour. It features three characters on three continents who barely interact with one another. And after 130 minutes, it stops without concluding. You will literally walk away scratching your head and wondering...WHY?!?!  Why did I sit through that ENTIRE movie!!??
B000FS9FCG|4.0|This is just good movie making! It has all the action guys like, the love interest for the ladies, and - what a surprise these days, an actually well written script with good plot and a turn or two. Natalie Portman is as delicious as ever (another plus for the guys) though the direction on the camera work was poor in that, as so many do for some reason, they kept cutting off her feet.  And often the top of her head too. She was barefoot in many of the scenes, but that opportunity was missed by the narrow camera angle. But overall a very watchable film, we actually never used the F/F feature to skip any slow parts. Recommended for a movie night.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|Here is why i like this movie.<br /><br />1, The movie was fast paced, it didn't slow down much.<br />2, Graphic/animation was pretty good.<br />3, The action scene were well deliver.<br />5, This movie shows violence the way it's suppose to.<br /><br />Note, I'm not a batman fan, but the movie was made like it's suppose to be made, batman is just a human and this movies gets that across unlike the justice league batman that survives everything that should kill him. It's good to see that characters have short comings which adds to their persona. So with that said If you have not seen it, you should even if your a not a batman fan, like me.
B003UYUR0G|4.0|The pre release photos and hype made this look like it was going to be a campy homoerotic muscle festival disguised as Disney's usual overblown, sugar coated, nausea inducing brain rot. Under the production leadership of Jerry Bruckheimer (who has dropped more bombs in the past year than George W. during his entire reign) and the knowledge that it was based on a video game, I was fairly certain I was going to stay far away from it.  Still . . . there was the intrigue of some very good actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal, Ben Kingsly and Alfred Molina.  And those previews looked interesting . . . sort of.  When I saw the blu ray disc at Walmart for half price I though I would give it a chance and I suppose it was worth half the retail price.    It isn't ever going to be a great film but it is sometimes a very good looking one.  The set design here is amazing and there is some beautiful location photography.  Sadly there are also several scenes that look fairly bad due to obvious CGI compositing.  There are a few decent by the numbers action sequences that are also sort of fun.  The visual effects are nothing special, you've seen all of it before a thousand times.  There are some surprisingly fake looking CGI snakes in this thing too.  I'm talking SyFy channel low budget quickie stuff here.      The actors are very good (as expected) with Ben Kingsley being a perfect villain.  Jake Gyllenhaal also proves that he can do just fine as a swashbuckling action hero.  Strangely all the work he did on his body to turn himself into an action hunk was mostly for nothing as his costumes keep him covered up through almost all of the film. All those muscle bound photos, posters and promotional clips don't represent what ended up on screen. I should think Gyllenhaal would be a little peeved about that. Jake also manages a passable British accent.  Did ancient Persians really speak with British accents?  Alfred Molina as a sheik gets what is probably the most memorable role in this curious film.  He also brings an occasional flash of much needed humor to this thing.    The script is actually fairly interesting and thoughtful and has more going for it than this type of film usually does.  Mike Newell managed to direct his unweildy epic without making a fool of himself and for the most part the film stays under control without ever giving in to the temptation to stop the plot for a 20 minute action sequence.  Perhaps that is because this film actually has enough of a plot to sustain interest.  Sadly there are some truly atrocious editing choices made that, rather than enhance the experience of the film, take the viewer out of it and remind us that we are watching a movie.    Disney did a good job with this blu ray release. Picture and sound quality are excellent, as you would expect from a film that was pretty much made for blu ray.  I bought the single disc edition rather than the 3 disc \\"special\\" edition because I have no use for a digital copy and didn't want a DVD.  The disc comes in a very nice looking embossed, holographic slipcase.  Really slick looking.  There is a well done documentary included on the disc called \\"An Unseen World\\" that gives some insight into production and costume design as well as interviews with the actors and crew.  Very standard stuff but it gave me all the info I wanted.  There is also a deleted scene included as well as seemingly endless advertisements promoting Disney blu rays.  When I put the disc in I was glad to see it had a quick loading time but then I braced myself for the onslaught of Disney propoganda that I knew was about to hit me.  MUCH TO MY SHOCK and PLEASURE, the screen displayed a message saying I could skip the ads by pressing the \\"top menu\\" button.  I did and I was immediately at the menu and watching the opening credits in about 15 seconds.  Thank you for that Disney. I truly didn't want to have to fast forward through trailers for Chihuahua movie sequels or listen to you tell me how my family and Ishould be watching television.    Yes Disney, I still hate you simply because your films are atrocious, mind breakingly awful, conformist dreck and your relentless promotion of EVERY nonsensical film you peddle as \\"Disney's latest masterpiece\\" or \\"Instant Classic\\"  became laughable in 1980.  Nevertheless you proved that \\"family\\" entertainment does not have to be dumbed down to the point of idiocy with PRINCE OF PERSIA.  Of course, this film stunk up the box office like a rotting abscess  under Donald Duck's tail feathers so I'm sure you will fall right back into HANNAH MONTANNA DOES DALLAS: THE DISNEY 3D EXPERIENCE (coming to a theatre near me in the very near future).  Still...thanks for the temporary improvment.  It was unexpected.
0679735909|3.0|Hm.. I don't really know about this one. I think Byatt made an outstanding job with this book, it is extraordinary that she wrote not only the main story but all the different poems and diary entries and literary essays, and I think she did it amazingly. It is an unbelievable achievement. But still.. the book seems much more like a literaray analysis than an easily flowing book. Sometimes it is quite slow and difficult to keep going and that's what made it to me less enjoyable.

B002ZCDR88|5.0|Leave your sleep, Natalie Merchant is an amazing collections of poems done to music.  The stories behind the authors of the poems are good and funny too!  The music to the poems are happy, sad and thoughtful!   One of my favorites is Adventures of Isabel, Ogden Nash (1902-1971), the music has such a happy movable sound! If I am able to, I dance, when listening. That's when I am home and not in the car. LOL  [[ASIN:B002ZCDR88 Leave Your Sleep (2CD)]]    Thank you, Natalie Merchant, your so talented and brought lots of smiles to our family with Leave your sleep!
B003YK42LQ|2.0|Pretty disappointing album, but I kinda saw it coming when they started to be really popular. I hate sounding like one of those music snobs that only likes bands before they're popular, but most of the time it's true.  Is it just me, or are these songs really boring?
0446618322|4.0|This was the second novel I read from Nicholas Sparks, and though after Dear John I concluded his writing was not for me I couldn't resist picking up The Lucky One because of its exciting plot (see above) (as I have already confessed, I'm a huge war-time-romance junkie).     I enjoyed reading The Lucky One, the plot was exactly what the blurb led me to expect, no disappointments there.     The characters were interesting and I loved that Sparks made them complex, he gave them history, memories, backgrounds and thoughts. Ben also became a little 3D kid, so real I could completely picture him in his glasses playing chess seriously. Nana and her sayings sometimes made me wonder, trying to decipher the hidden meaning behind her words and when I did, it made me laugh, she definitely is a character!     My only compliant in the character development compartment is Keith Clayton, the ex-husband of Beth and father of Ben. Sparks made him a true villain: a creepy pervert, a bully who's having anger issues and exploits his child. I'm sorry he made him such a one-dimensional bad character, it would have been better for the novel if he had given him a few qualities to accompany all these faults.     I also loved the structure of the novel, that we got to know Logan and the meaning behind some of his actions and decisions chapter by chapter through flashbacks as he remembered his tours in Iraq and his time with his mates and Victor.     I think one of the strongest trait of the novel was Sparks' vivid description of the southern life: I could feel the heat, the humidity and completely picture the setting, the narrative really transported me to the scene of the story.     My second complaint is regarding the ending of the novel. I felt it too forced, it was Sparks' way to tie up all the loose ends by taking Keith out of the picture, but making amends by making him a hero in the end. I didn't like the end.     Plot: 9/10   Characters: 8/10   Ending: 5/10   Writing: 7/10   Cover: 7/10 (this is a recurring error with Nicholas Sparks' books that the cover girl never matches the description of the heroine: in The Lucky One Beth is blonde with blue eyes, and the cover girl is a brunette..)
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was introduced to this film by my daughter.  She rented the movie and suggested that I watch it too.  I fell in love with it.  It is a romance movie with a lot of humor, also, a nice, happy ending.
0553805371|3.0|Even  though I'm not a scientistic, I can say thet they pushed too far the M-Theory and made so many mistakes. In some way they contradict some scientific postulates.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Okay, I will say this. Out of every video game controller I have ever used, and I have pretty much used them all, the Xbox 360's controller is my favorite. It has the perfect weight, the triggers are placed in the perfect position, the thumbsticks have the concave(inward) groove to have your thumb rest in, and the most important feature for me, and many others: the reversed analog sticks. Now as much as I love my PS2 and PS3, I couldn't do extensive gaming sessions because I have larger hands and having the thumbsticks mounted at the bottom of the controller started to take wear on my hands quickly each time I picked up the controller. However, seeing how my 360 died not too long ago, I was/am left only with my PS3, and the controller I fear. What was I to do? Well Power A came to the rescue, and not only did they restore the happiness of my hands with a PS3 controller, Power A also proved that third party companies can make great products with the right resources and commitment.<br /><br />First of all, you get all the features of the Sony brand in here. Six-Axis, dual rumble, and a built-in rechargeable battery; for $39.96 whereas the Sony brand is still $54.99. Now as for the performance, this is where I was on the fence about picking up this controller. I heard that the response time of the analog sticks were horrible and that the buttons would stick. Well after playing nearly 15 hours of Fallout New Vegas, I have had only one little kink, and that is if you have something blocking the dongle that is plugged into your usb slot, the controller will sync up around the obstruction. Example, I was my bed and I had my controller propped up my knees. My hands fell into my lap, and the controller's led ring blinked for about 3 seconds and presto, no problems after that. My knees were between my usb dongle and my controller, and it still worked great.<br /><br />Now as for the unresponsiveness of the analog sticks. Honestly I haven't had any lag or dead-zones. On top of that, I'm using the Grip-Its on top of the sticks, and they still are flawless. Again, been playing New Vegas for about 15 hours, and no problems aiming in any direction...its just as smooth and responsive at the Sony analog sticks. Button sticking was a problem I haven't come across yet, either. As for the texturing on the sides of the controller, I don't get why its causing tons of concern. The only way I see the grips becoming a problem is if you are gripping your controller like a vice.<br /><br />Overall, I'm 110% satisfied with this controller, and can easily recommend it to anyone who has a PS3, but wants a 360-like design for it...and without sacrificing any of the features of the original Dualshock 3. And one more thing, the battery life for the Power A is just as long as the Dualshock 3, and fortunately charges faster too. I'm actually considering getting a few as gifts for friends. Nice job Power A, you have a happy customer!ng the Grip-Its on top of the sticks, and they still are flawless.

1451539401|5.0|This novel was a big revelation for me. Even though I love period dramas, somehow the S&S movie didn\\"t manage to grab me. It was one of those movies, that I wasn't enthusiastic to rewatch, even though I love Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet and Hugh Grant, and think that they did a great job and the whole movie looks great, but it is the story that I was not fond of.<br /><br />So you can imagine that I wasn't enthusiastic to read the novel either. Actually, when it was voted as the next book in my reading group, I decided I would skip it. And then my cousin just gave it to me and when I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I loved it! Somehow it is completely different from the movie. Here Elinor isn't an Ice Queen, just a private and mature girl, and Marianne didn't annoy me with her liveliness and passionate views as in the movie. I think the only character I liked better in the movie than in the book was Edward Ferrars.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that S&S is quite an understated Austen novel: Pride and Prejudice, Presuasion and Emma usually get all the praise and are the favourites of readers, but this Austen novel is excellent in its subdued pastel coloured way too.<br /><br />If you love the movie or the miniseries, you ahve to read it, and if the screen adaptations didn't really engage you, I'd still encourage you to give S&S a chance, the novel is well worth the read, I'm sure you will love it!
0451228375|5.0|Years ago I really enjoyed 'Pillars of the Earth', and just recently found this 'sequel' of sorts.   Once again I am drawn into this book and do not want to set it down, but also do not want to finish it too fast.  Great characters and the continueing story line does stand alone, so the only thing you are missing if you did not read the first book is an excellent story.
0060899220|5.0|This book is really great, and as a fan who was first introduced to Anthony Bourdain through his show, I enjoyed how the book had the same tone as his speech. As I was reading, it almost seemed liked he was reading the book to me. For anyone who likes No Reservations, I highly recommend this book.
0393327345|1.0|I wouldn't have finished reading this book if it weren't for the sake of improving my German reading skills (It's the first book I've read in German). Now I regret having read it. It felt like the book ofered me nothing - it was boring, nihilistic for no good reason, lacking any absorbing or convincing story line,  just plain stupid. Maybe I should have read it in English and then would have appreciated it more, but I feel the whole Fight Club thing is being oversold.
0345505387|4.0|Being a fan of all things Gabaldon, I couldn't wait to get this book! I thought from the description that it would be the years Jamie spent in hiding in the cave above Lallybroch, but it isn't. It tells a portion of the first story in the series mostly from a third person POV and there is a bit of a twist with the characters.  The art work is good and it reads like a comic book.  I think it is a worthy effort and something new for Jamie and Claire addicts like myself (think Jamie's naked butt), and if you are a serious collector of Gabaldon, then it is a must have for your shelves.  But don't expect a great story from it, you will be disappointed.
0765326353|5.0|Many of the previous reviews nicely summarize the plot points and general story.  I just wanted to add that I had pretty much given up on heroic fantasy many years ago.  Most of it was repetitive and not very imaginative, thankfully The Way of Kings is incredibly entertaining and inventive.  If you love the genre, this is a slam dunk to pick up (assuming you can lift the 1000 page tome), if you have given up on the heroic fantasy, time to pick this one up and be really pleasantly surprised.  I am a little concerned about Sanderson's plan for 9 more of these epics, let's hope the well is deep.
B001GWK2MC|4.0|We recently purchased this for our 2yr old son.  Living in Wisconsin in the winter months can be brutal.  Having the space for this in our rec room ensures playtime alternatives for him.  Easy to inflate, light weight to move around and durable.  My son continues to enjoy this every time we make a trip downstairs.  Highly recommended !! for the price.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|I think Pixar/Disney really hit the nail on the head in this 3rd addition to the Toy Story Series.  I truly believe that this is one of the best series (that wasn't originally written as a series) out there.    When Toy Story 2 came out, I remember being so worried that they were really going to blow it! Most sequel movies - especially cartoon sequels - are terrible!  When I went to see it I loved it!  It definitely matched the greatness and creativity of the first.    Then 10 years down the road I hear about a 3rd installment to the series.  I had a bitter sweet feeling in my stomach!  I was excited to be able to relieve the Toy Story magic yet again... but once again I was wrought with the fear of this being a big mistake.  I was so worried that Toy Story 3 wouldn't be able to measure up, but I held out hope.  And to my very great surprise it was every bit as good as I could've ever hoped for!  I laughed!  I Cried!  I was completely gripped by the story!    And the best part of all... was the way they decided to not take you back to Toy Story 2... rather than tag onto the work that was done so long ago, they made the story more believable by making all the characters older (as if the story never really ended - we just never saw what happened the years between 2 and 3).  I especially loved it, because it matched me in so many ways.  When Toy Story came out I was probably old enough to be about 3 or 4 years older than what Andy is portrayed... and here we are with Andy going to college, and me just graduating from college!  They really make you build that connection that makes the story seem that much more realistic.  I give this movie 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who loves a great story.
B0043CJ8AY|5.0|One month. Two favorite bands. Two new, long-awaited albums. One kicks ass, one sadly disappoints. If you'd told me Kings of Leon and Maroon 5, I'd have bet that KOL was the winner. Wrong-o. My wife, myself, and our two daughters agree on little when it comes to music, but all 4 of us can't stop playing Hands All Over. Even the dog perks up when Misery comes on.    Serious stuff? Nah. Polished, fun, danceable? Big time. Best party album since The Ting Tings. It's even stopped certain family members from playing Lady Gaga all day. If for no other reason, I'd give this 5 stars.

B0042EJD8A|5.0|This is one of the most important films of the decade. It reveals the incredibly dirty and destructive side of \\"clean burning natural gas.\\" From Josh Fox's living room in Pennsylvania begins a journey to Arkansas, Texas, Wyoming and beyond. No matter where the story carries him, the view is always the same with a repeated pattern of toxic chemicals, contaminated water, mysterious foul smells and above all, worry and frustration of the citizens forced to live in GasLand everyday.   The people featured in the film become your friends, you cannot help but like them.  They share their stories and you will find yourself searching the internet to learn more of the injustice being delivered on them at the hands of corporations who consider them to be part of a sacrifice zone and their elected leaders busy looking the other way as they accept millions of dollars in campaign contributions.   Though a dark and gloomy subject you do get a taste of Josh Fox's wry sense of humor and marvel at the ability of the people in the film to still manage a smile despite what is happening to them and thousands more like them.  See this film. It will leave you with the sense that this is just plain wrong and you will have to ask yourself, what can I do about it?
1439181780|5.0|I have long been a big fan of The Secret. I have studied many books over the years along this line of thinking and living and I know it works and changes your life. The Secret was a simplified path to all the good that can come to you.  The Power really gets to the meat of it. I can't begin to tell you how following these books in every corner of your life can change things, and lightening fast. It takes discipline, and \\"The Power\\" tells you very specifically how to do it. It is not some woo woo out there new age method, it's what we have been taught by various teachers for years, including Jesus. It is so simple yet so complex . I highly recommend this book. I personally like to listen to it while I drive, as it sinks in better for me. I also love the Esther Hicks books.   In these troubled chaotic times, this book is an oasis!
B000V9D5LG|5.0|Very good lens for the money. Very cost effective for advanced beginners with today's budget constraints  Good in relatively low incident and ambient lighting, wherein flash would distract the subject. Should have been sold with a pouch.
B003WMX3SY|4.0|From installing the motherboard, to navigating a built pc, this case is a true joy to work with. Major awesome features:    1) Power supply slide out tray -- This made adding a power supply a ton easier and faster. And when the unit needs to be upgraded, it will be a snap.    2) Thumbscrews on everything -- Need to get access to a section in the case fast, this design makes it possible. Almost every screw that you will access can be manipulated with just your hands.     3) Lots of fans -- 15 possible 120mm fans!!! Whoa, this is some very serious cooling. The case comes with 5, and they are the two speed 120mm variety from Antec.     4) Straight path to the motherboard -- With this case you have direct, full access to the motherboard. No lips, sharp edges, or overhangs. The motherboard tray is removable but I doubt anyone will need it. Makes installing, or working with the components a snap.    5) Motherboard tray -- It has a hole in it! The spot where your proc will be mounted, there is a hole so that the dans will be able to cool the underside of your processor mount.    Bummer points:    a) Toolbox needs a real screwdriver to access it -- It fits snug, but when at a lan party, if not screwed in, you might loose it. These should be thumb screwed on.      Great case! Building this box to move around. So far love the handles, and how easy it is to work on the box. You won't be disappointed.

0061766089|4.0|Tim Brown's understated, exciting take on innovation draws its inspiration from design; he calls the process \\"design thinking.\\" Brown is CEO and president of IDEO, an influential U.S. design and innovation firm. This book conveys that innovation is the norm at IDEO. The company expects employees to come up with not just fresh ideas but new solutions to real-world problems. Brown's and IDEO's expectations of changing the world are realistic because they've done it more than once; their excitement about creation never seems giddy or off-balance. IDEO has accomplished so much that many of Brown's suggestions might seem familiar to those in the field, where IDEO's techniques are already widely known. Even so, this methodical, socially aware approach proves engaging and useful. getAbstract recommends this guide to designers, to those who works with designers and to anyone interested in innovation and creativity.

B004927I50|5.0|I'm not the typical Taylor Swift fan, since I'm a decade older than she is, but I love her work just the same.  This CD is definitely more of the heartfelt melodies and the angst of young love from her previous albums, with a couple of surprisingly fun songs as she becomes braver and \\"gets the last word\\".      Many people are saying that this is more of the same, but they say it as if it was a bad thing!  The fact that Taylor writes all of her own songs and writes about what she knows is quite an awesome thing, really.  What young woman in late adolescence isn't infatuated with being infatuated?  Isn't looking for that one true love?  Isn't still wanting to believe in fairy tales?     She's real and doesn't pretend to be something she isn't, which is a far cry from Miley Cyrus' terribly makeover attempts to appear older than she really is.    This album is all about transitions.  Swift is at a very difficult age, on the precipace of adulthood and just starting to realize that maybe growing up isn't all that glamorous, after all. It's hard, it's ugly, it's painful, but it's inevitable.      Swift offers a real experience for her listeners and is someone you won't mind your daughter listening to. A real treasure!
B00006BTCA|5.0|\\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" had tremendous power over me when it was first released.  To this day it is still a classic album, holding nearly all the best of Interpol.  While I like \\"Our Love to Admire\\" more, this comes at a very close second.  The particular sound of this album is fresh and addicting.  It makes you wonder, \\"Why don't more bands sound like this?\\"    Listen to \\"NYC,\\" \\"Obstacle 1,\\" and \\"Untitled\\" (These should be enough to encourage you to purchase).  While the whole album is a masterpiece, those songs stick out as the \\"best tracks.\\"  While the album is a beautiful trip, sometimes it can be saddening.  The more somber points aren't worse, but they can bring out the emotion hiding within you.  That is why I call this a powerful album, because it grasps your senses and plays with your mood.  If you want to listen to definitive Interpol, \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" should be your first stop.  Then carry on with \\"Antics\\" and \\"Our Love to Admire.\\"  If you buy their self-titled album and suspect that there's not much more to this band, you are very mistaken.  The first three albums from Interpol are all five star classics.  Their debut is a classic that goes further and earns itself the title of an album of the decade.    Interpol is an amazing band.  Unfortunately, lately, their talent hasn't shown through.  Luckily we have three perfect albums in their history waiting to be listened to by you.  I am confident in saying that Interpol is a band, once listened to, never forgotten.
0446618306|4.0|Yes, this is your typical 'chick flick' novel. But there's more. Half the novel is about John and his fractured relationship with his father. His relationship (or lack of) with his father is very similar as me and my father, so I could relate, and so this novel was very dear to me. So if you like 'chick flicks' or have a fractured (or lacking) relationship with your father (if you're a guy) this is the book for you. It's also a quick read.
B000CNDIZE|5.0|I LOVE this CD. This is the type of music that I love to hear Sia's voice with. I also love her single on the \\"Twilight Eclipse\\" soundtrack, called \\"My Love\\" However, I've listened to some of her latest CD, and it's not like this one. So, if anyone out there knows of any of her other CDs that are similar to this one, can you let me know?
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|Now, I'm thirteen, so you might be thinking Â«Oh she wouldn't read this-she'd be reading some crap book like Twilight or another soppy romance piece of junk!Â»  But I'll tell it to you straight. This is wayyyyyy better than a silly YA vampire novel...I mean there are hundreds of those!!    I am more of a fantasy reader and I enjoy adult books too (I quite enjoy Anne Rice though I don't consider her an adult writer, and after reading the Girl With The Dragon tatoo series I don't love them-I'll take Stephen King any day!) but these books are my guilty pleasure.  I started with Shopaholic and Baby because I had nothing to read at camp when I was eleven and my counseller lent it to me (I had unfortunatley run through my Redwall books) and I was hooked from the first page!    These books are amazing.  My personal favourite parts were the letters and emails around the chapters where she would make excuses like &#34;My arm is broken so I can't come&#34; and when she says her aunt is sick and needs 20 more dollars to buy this imaginary aunt a Hermes scarf (seriously? A Hermes scarf? So expensive...}    I also loved the characters...unlike some have said, Becky is not mean or detached...I found her to be a little selfish and airheaded at times but it's not like she meant to be-are we not all like that at times?    I adorded Tarkwin and Suze and pretty much everyone...except Luke.  He annoyed me.  I found it amusing that she worked for a savings company when so in debt and cute that...ahh, I shan't ruin it for you!    I read this first installment when I was twelve and yes it dropped the f bomb but it was not terrible and scarring or anyything.    I like to tell you this was the best book but I personally prefer House of Night and Twiloght...KIDDING (two of the worst books I have ever read.)  All in all it was a great book and I promise you will love it!!!!!!!!!!!! &#60;3
0525951652|5.0|this is by far the best book that Ken Folett has written. I cannot wait for the next one to be available!!!!
0345404475|3.0|I like futuristic book, and this one is good. Not as good as the classics (Fahrenheit, Brave New World, 1984, etc). But still very good.

B003EYVXSW|3.0|There really hasn't been much done with the subject of cloning in sci-fi film making and it's a shame. Though this is no great movie by any standard it is replete with the possibilities available for the subject. Here you have two romantically entwined gene scientists who grow a female something or other that lives and begins to mature. Now what? Looks like they didn't think that far ahead because things go so far that the situation begins to move under its own weight.    The first act is kind of a drag. They're setting up the story and it involves a lot of science with read-outs, graphics and such, and it doesn't make for a very inviting viewer experience. When the second act starts though things begin to heat up, and as good it is, it also hints at all sorts of things the script doesn't deal with. Such as the fact that they're nurturing an intelligent female being that is maturing rapidly with no hope of ever having a true loving, sexual counterpart. This is also a being that has to be, because of legal issues, hidden from the rest of the world. She will never be part of \\"regular\\" society. There is also the area of physiology. This being has been created. All sorts of things can go wrong. Do all her parts work in harmony? How will food react with her system? Does she have too many teeth or too few? Will she have a menstrual cycle? Some of these things they deal with a bit, but there is a well spring of items that go untapped.     The third act starts out pretty good but gets a bit too much at the climax. It could have been much worse though. I have to say that watching this movie made me more than a bit nervous. All the things roiling under the surface, but never brought forth, still made an impact on my nervous system.       Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley do well in there rolls but Delphine Chaneac, as the being Dren, was outstanding. Kudos must go to both the art department and special effects department for their realization of the character. She is someone whowill not be forgotten once she's been seen. This is well worth seeing. It might not be a perfect movie, but the highs are real high and make the rest of it watchable at the least.
0143034901|4.0|I am still reading this book, but it's great so far. It's long, and kinda complicated, so I recommend reading it as quickly as possible (I sometimes read several novels at once, flipping between them all, and this book i recommend not doing that).
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|Purchased this \\"magic wand\\" for my husband, a huge Harry Potter fan and a remote control addict. He loved it and immediately began to teach the wand various commands. I find it a little hard to get used to, thus the slightly lower rating on ease of operation. He finds it all kinds of fun and can't wait to show it off to our friends and guests. Delivery from the supplier was on time and as expected. The wand came in a beautiful box which is used to store and display.  I'd recommend this for any magic lover or remote control freak!
B003INBNXO|4.0|Kung Fu movies have a spotty history at best. Some have been good. Others lousy and still others have been laughable. The past 10 years or so have seen a great maturing of the genre. The stars, directors, budgets have all risen to create a genuinely respectable category in film making. \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and \\"Hero\\" have not only been great Kung Fu movies, they've been great movies.     \\"Ip Man\\" is right up there with the best. The producers were smart in using an actual historical event on which to base their film. The first act sets up the characters. You get to meet Master Ip and see how he truly embodies the philosophies of Kung Fu. He's a genuinely decent dude. In the second act the Japanese invade China and society breaks down. Two thirds of the population split the scene and the last third scrap for whatever food and jobs they can get while dodging Japanese soldiers. Master Ip Takes on slave level labor as he tries to keep the household together. The head Japanese General wants his Kung Fu soldiers to take on the locals in Kung Fu matches where a sack of rice is the prize for the winner. The third act is Ip Man finally caving into the request that he fight the Japanese General. He does and, of course, kicks his butt. They then go on to a post script on how he went on to form other Kung Fu schools and gained a couple of million desciples.    This is a good idea that works well. The sets and costuming look authentic and it is generally directed well. The sub-plots were decent enough and added depth to the proceedings, but the real joy here are the fight scenes. They are as well, if not better, choreographed and directed as any I've ever seen. The fights are spaced out nicely throughout the movie and they escalate in intensity. What is cool is the climactic fight between the two heavies isn't drawn out, Hollywood style, for too long. It's not short but long enough for the viewer to get his/her ya yas.     If Kung Fu movies are your poison, this should slay you.
B000JLSLZQ|4.0|The video is good. The transaction was good. I wished they could have picked a better singer for the phantom. Spoiled to Michael Crawford and the few other ones I have seen on and off broadway. But a good production overall. If you are a fan you will enjoy it.
B002TVQ4AS|3.0|I recommend this documentary. Sensational musicians and timeless music contrasts with Cuban social conditions. The film's perspectives give a true natural sense of the country and it's musical roots. * Try to purchase the DVD separately (1 disc) because the music CD does not reflect all of the music from the film and contains only 5 songs. Best to purchase individual music CD's featuring artists from the film.
B0000024ZT|4.0|I enjoyed this album very much... Though it has the innocence of someone who´s just starting an astonishing career, you can still hear the great Bruce to come and that incredible band he teamed with. Thank you, Bruce, I hope you keep on producing more of this great rock and roll.
B000MUK3HI|3.0|I bought this olddie LP for my 13 year old son who is a big fan of the Beatles, unfortunately, what most interested him was the original cover packaging, wich never came. Instead I recived it with a big sign, in other cover package, that said \\"Beatles LP inside\\". He was very un happy about that. And I was upset because the seller picture at Amazon.com shows the original packing. Thas the only reazon I did not give the seller five stars. I will claim the seller about this issue.
044656740X|1.0|It's obvious the only thing you get out of this book is to write a book and make a huge publicity.  This way the curiosity of many persons will make them buy it.  You can see this clearly as he himself markets other author's books in his own book and in turn these other authors (The 16% Solution: How to Get High Interest Rates in a Low-Interest World with Tax Lien Certificates, Revised Edition by Joel S. Moskowitz and  INC. & Grow Rich!: How To Cut Taxes 70% & Protect Your Assets Forever! by C. W. \\"Al\\" Allen, Cheri S. Hill, Diane Kennedy, and Garrett Sutton)  return the favor to Robert T. Kiyosaki by marketing his book on their books.  You will be wasting your money and more importantly (something you don't back) your time if you purchase this book and read it.  You will learn nothing but speculations of investing.  Don't waste your money, send me your address or an address and I'll give you my copy for FREE.  This is how much I believe this book is a WASTE.  The only thing I ask is that after you read it (if you do) give it to someone else.
1416972250|4.0|many unexpected twist andd turns. i was sucked in and couldnt put the book down. loved it
0553805371|5.0|Essentially, this book is a great layman's overview of where modern cosmology and physics are at the present. It also states fairly clearly what remains to be resolved.  It has mid-level complexity - no equations, but modern physics is inherently complex so there are some passages you will have to re-read a few times.  The book is actually a bit too short I would say.  Modern physics is so vast and complex that a book of this length is bound to fall a bit short.  Hawking also may be fairly criticized for not discussing how controversial M-Theory is.     I think most of the criticisms of this book are motivated, explicitly or under the covers, by Christians who are upset that Hawking is not the ally that they once delusionally suspected.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|I bought this toy for my daughter a couple of months ago to help her along with her crawling.  She is 9 months now.  At first she was scared of it because it was gliding around.  She loves the mirror, but she has to lay down to see herself in it, so that didn't help her with her crawling at all.  When it isn't moving, she loves to bat at it though, and she very much loves the songs.  She learned \\"If your happy and you know it\\" with me and claps her hands to it.  Overall, its a fun toy, but didn't interest my girl enough for her to crawl after it.
0788813374|4.0|If spacesuits used in ARMAGEDDON seem real, it's because they are! For the first (and only) time, actors were given NASA's permission to use the multi-million dollar high-tech outfits. Previously restricted NASA facilities, such as the buoyancy lab and closed-down launch pad where the 1967 Apollo 1 disaster occurred, were made available. Filming was also allowed on top of a space shuttle launch tower and on an actual deep water oil rig.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />A life-killing asteroid hurtles towards Earth as two drilling teams try to save the planet by landing on the massive boulder, burrowing 800 feet into it and implanting a nuclear device. Humor-laced but overlong disaster flick fails in part due to touchy-feely subplots, one of which is a boring romance between Affleck and Tyler. Stormare's pushy Russian cosmonaut is great fun, as is Buscemi's space-demented turn as super-genius and super-sexed Rockhound. Both actors portrayed the kidnapper/killers in FARGO (1996).<br /><br />.<br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(6.4) Armageddon (1998) - Bruce Willis/Ben Affleck/Liv Tyler/Steve Buscemi/Billy Bob Thornton/Will Patton/Michael Clarke Duncan/Owen Wilson/Shawnee Smith/Charlton Heston (narrator)
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I watched this whole season over a weekend.  I could not stop watching it was so good!!!  Not recommended for kids or young adults though!
B0042AEOG0|5.0|At first, when I listened to the cd briefly for an overview- I thought it was good, but I wasn't blown away. I think it's always that way for me. But then I go back and listen to the songs again and pay attention to the words and my opinion always changes. I absolutely love this cd! Of course there are always songs that are my favorites- and it pretty much jives with everyone elses favorites so I'm not gonna list them. If you are a Mariah fan OR just looking for a new christmas cd with unheard songs- you won't be disappointed. She sings all from upbeat/happy, to traditional, to retro-feeling- all done with great taste and for all to love no matter what age. Give it a try- you'll love it!

0525951652|5.0|I got hooked on Ken Follett's books starting with \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  I loved it.  I quickly found \\"World Without End\\" and after reading it as well, I became interested in other books he had written.  I did find that his typical genre was crime/thriller, which I do enjoy, but I think he has hit gold with his venture into \\"historical fiction\\".<br /><br />I just finished reading \\"Fall of Giants\\" and LOVED it.  I am so excited that it is a trilogy!  I loved the characters, the setting and the amazing detail, he made this part of history (especially the fighting scenes which he was able to write in a way that made me feel like I was actually there).  Some complain that the details aren't spot on accurate.  Mr. Follett explains at the end of the book that he tried to follow along with accurate history details when possible but did use some creative writing to make it fit more with his characters, THAT is what makes it such a great book.  No-one really knows exactly what happened at every point in time and it would be a very boring book if it was just a bunch of exact quotes and details.<br /><br />As I have with previous books of his, I've done a lot of research on the era, the war, the geographical locations where the book is set (Wales, France, England, Germany, U.S.) just to see what it looked like and learned a lot while doing it.<br /><br />If you've enjoyed his other two historical fiction novels, you'll love this one.<br /><br />PS- A book review is NOT the correct forum to complain about the price Kindle owners, you're clogging up the reviews for your own needs when it's supposed to be ABOUT the BOOK, not the marketing or the price.
B0041EVYVK|3.0|After watching all those wonderful videos in Youtube, I thought the CD would also capture those raw, honest performances. Unfortunetely I was wrong. Lanois, one of my musical heroes, decided to apply a lot of his production tricks and I must say that I think the final result is less appealing than the original performances. Am I the only one who likes better the videos of \\"I Believe in You\\", \\"Nomad Knows\\", \\"Ring the Alarm\\" and \\"Surely\\" than the versions included in the record? Trixie's voice sounds dull (so to speak  - especially noticeable in \\"I Believe in you\\") and Brian Blade's drums sound less powerful.    As a Lanois fanois I will certainly buy the record, but I think I will find myself going back to the original Youtube videos quite often for the 'real thing'.
0345350472|5.0|Everything positive to say about this work has already been said. I'll just reiterate that is an essential for whoever loved the movie, and that it is is better than most movie-book adaptations. ^-^
B001F12J0C|3.0|And I won't spoil the \\"Big Mystery\\", but that wasn't all that original, either.    Still, entertaining if you're not looking for something particularly cerebral.
0553805371|5.0|You will be informed and entertained with the most up to date information on the Quantum Theory and the Universe. A very readable book for most people with high school physics background.    Only one error I can find serious enough to be mentioned here. Hope it will be corrected in future edition.  The error: Illustration on page 97. The ball being dropped from Seat 13B in the first frame is correct. The second frame as observed from outside would look exactly the same as frame 1 except the whole frame shifted to left. The major error is that ball cannot be away from seat 13B from where it was dropped.
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|I love SATC, I have all the seasons on DVD, which I watch religously, both movies now, the book, the game, plus lots of iphone apps, so yes I am a huge fan, and obviously addicted, I couldnt wait for the second movie to come out, but was a bit disappointed, first thing Stanford is marrying Anthony, hugh? what happened to Marcus?, and didnt theese to guys hate hate each other, now they are getting MARRIED?, just weird I thought, and the other guys you see for like two seconds, like Steve, Harry, Aiden, and even Smith Jerrad, Big had a slightly bigger part, but was pathetic, and weak as Carrie is some what bored of her married life, and complains that Big doesnt have sparkle, and that he doest get dressed up enough to take her out on the town, and is pissed off that dinner sometimes arrives in a box, and that big put a tv in the beedroom, she even flees to her old apartment, very whiney, Miranda finaly has it with her job, Charlotte finds out that having two kids is indeed a handful, which I can relate, with more than two, Samantha is her ussual self, and is hysterical with her outlook on life, the pace and story plot was very blah blah, and was for me being used to the seasons and first movie, was like reading a long, slow book, if they come out with a third movie, they better put some pizzaze and sparkle into it, spicing things up, and the most, most part of the DVD tht actually pissed me off, was the total lack of extras, like the movie wasnt good enough to do making of, and other featurettes, and where is the commentary?!, I hate hate it, when  the studio goes on  the cheap, and sends out a bare, bare, bones DVD, well I guess the film wasnt all that, so why should the DVD be any better, come on folks do another movie and fix all these problems, the plot, and a presentable DVD, sad
B003DZX44I|5.0|I love Disney movies and I love Beauty and the Beast. Have not owned it since it was on VHS so of corse the picture quality was a million times better.  Cannot say anything bad about the movie!
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I would have to agree with a lot of the other viewers. I went to see this not knowing anything about this film, or the original for that matter, and was completely riveted to my seat. I couldn't believe how well these two young actors were able to translate emotion through very little action, whether it was Chloe Moretz's  very slight facial expressions (like when she says \\"I'm a lot stronger than you think.\\" to Owen, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee), or the all too familiar (for me, anyway) bullying that poor Owen had to go through daily. I've seen many vampire and monster films in general, but I don't think I've ever felt sorry for the vampire. The pain and sadness emanating from both characters resonates pretty strongly throughout as you begin to learn a little more about them. The lack of a large cast, and more so, aside from Abby's \\"guardian\\", there is a distinct feeling that these two are completely alienated by those closest to them.  I'd be surprised if there wasn't at least a couple nominations for awards from this film. There are some very sincere and soft elements to this film, but it is also quite disturbing at the same time. This is an amazing film, and I'd suggest any fan of the monster-movie genre to see this, just try not to let the negative reviews from some critics preform an opinion for you. I went back to the theater a couple more times, thankfully, as it was only up for a few weeks around my area.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I was very hesitent to buy this movie since I had not heard alot about it. I was very plesently surprised and as was my son. My son didn't seem interested in it, so I just popped it in when he wasnt looking and now he loves it!! We watch it often. Its totally relatable as many know a grumpy old man. But it shows great story behind why he is grumpy and how happy he once was to now becoming a sad old man. I absolutly love the Big bird and the talking dog- they almost make the movie to me. They are both fun to watch and are just plain adorable. I have so many lines that come to mind when I think of the movie that are cathy and funny! Everytime I see my dog jerk his head and look out the window I think \\"SQUIRELL\\"!!! It is just plain cute and has a great message behind it. In the end the old man has a new adventure that he never would have had if it weren't for getting caught up with the \\"small mail man\\" lol, the giant bird and the talking dog!! loved it and highly recommend!!
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Excellent rendition of the times when the Crusades were taking place and Richard the Lionhearted was on his way back from the Holy Land. Robin is one of his followers and after the death of Richard runs afoul of King John and his henchmen. This could have been the way that Robin Hood started and then ended up in Sherwood Forest with Maid Marian.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Watched the entire Sound of Music Blu-ray feature today on a twelve-foot wide screen.  The detail is incredible-with no annoying edge enhancement. The DTS 7.1 soundtrack is also a major improvement over previous editions. Twentieth-Century Fox needs to be given much credit for the meticulous restoration of this film. It feels like I own a 70MM film print instead of a Blu-ray disc! Thank you, Fox, for a magnificent achievement in remastering a classic film.  This box set includes some great \\"extras\\".  The hardcover book is very informative, and has many pictures from the making of the film.  The copy of the original souviner program was a nice touch.  The set also includes some great picture postcards of the cast in Salzburg, Austria.  Finally, the music box was a welcome addition to this box set.  I am sure my wife will enjoy it.  It has a small storage area inside, and plays \\"My Favorite Things\\".  Again, Thanks much, Twentieth-Century Fox, for a job well done!  Keep it going on your other classic films.
B00426CLDW|4.0|Purchased this item based on the description that indicated there were live tracks included on the import edition. Recieved a copy that was the exact same as the US Deluxe Version. Customer service were unable to explain mistake or assist in getting right copy. Very disappointing for a long term Amazon customer. Be carefull if you are going to spend your $30 on this item as they are still showing the wrong descripton. The CD itself is deffinately a continued growth from last album. It is a grower and now find myself enjoying almost all tracks.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|This is one of the best renditions of the Robin Hood myth that I have seen in years.  What I particularly liked about it is that I am reading a medieval history at the moment, and amazingly, this fit right in with my current book (the wonderful Forge of Christendom, by Tom Holland) about when the castles were built, what the horrendous social upheavals were like, and the abuses of power.<br /><br />The acting, starring with Crowe, is wonderful and subtle.  Blanchet is also brilliant as Maid Marion.  And the hilarious cameo of Max von Sydow, as the aristocrat who marries Marion off to Robin immediately after meeting him.  (\\"I woke up tumescent,\\" he says. \\"Imagine, at 80 years of age!\\"  Marion rolled her eyes.)  The bad guys are also convincing, though I didn't know any of them.<br /><br />The plot is rather convoluted.  Robin is returning from the Crusades with Richard the Lion Hearted, who has become a simple, embittered plunderer on his way home.  In need of a quick passage, Robin and his cohort pose as knights, a capital offense in medieval reckoning.  This embroils them in a number of complications, taking them through Nottingham.  There, posing as aristocrats, they enter local politics, which eventually involves organized violence.  At the end, and we all know the myth so this is about reviewing the film and not a spoiler, they are denounced as outlaws.  So this is the start of a series, if the producers can finance it.<br /><br />Recommended.  This is a good and solid version of the old story, or the first installment in a series.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Unforgetable season of Legend of the Seeker. Sad to see it was canceled but fun to relive the final season. Wished there were more extra features on the second season. I found the comentaries on the first season collection funny and entertaining. Recommend for anyone who was a fan of the first season and anyone else who likes a amazing show!!Will miss no new episodes but can at least enjoy the ones I got.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|I was really excited to read this book because I loved The Corrections so much.   This book just seemed to stretch on and on and ON and at times became verrrry boring.  About halfway through the book I started hoping it would start picking up a little, but it never did.  I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this... borrow it from a friend if you really have to read it.
0316069485|5.0|The best yet in the Harry Bosch series. All these stories keep me reading through the night, but this was tops. The story is compelling and very suspensful. Connelly is always willing to bump off key characters for the sake of a great read. Thus, the sense of tension remains real.   My daughter lives in Venice and I always use my phone maps to follow the action. The pier scenes were disturbing in a good way.  The continuity within the novel, and from book to book make the reader feel that he is aging with Harry and his brother.  Great.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I thought this was a hokey and poorly done joke for the first 20 minutes. By the time I was watching the third episode I realized this series reminded me of my childhood action comics. Wow... out of nowhere I was loving this series. I could not be more surprised, most of what I watch is documentary and film... Never standard television shows. But this is fantasy and drama and treachery and sex and love and perfectly pointless... The best of fun!

It turns out to be a ball of unique steam powers as the O'Hara corporation of America wants that in addition to the other steam-balls as his father Dr. Eddie Steam (Voiced by Alfred Molen) wants to use it for bad purposes as he created a fortress that could nearly destroy London.<br /><br />Enjoyable long-awaited Sci-fi/fantasy adventure from Katsuhiro Otomo the creator of the immortal anime masterpiece \\"Akira\\" has wrote/produced/designed and directed his first movie in years. After 10 years in the making the wait is over and got mixed results from fans of anime, i think it's quite good but not great. The plot is a little on the coherent side but the animation is visually stunning even with the mix of 2D and CGI together from Production I.G., i think it's Katsuhiro's weakest movie ever but still an enjoyable romp.<br /><br />This DVD contains the director's cut of this movie in both English dub and Japanese language track with subtitles and a few extras like featurette, multi-screen landscape study, interview with Katsuhiro Otomo, production drawing gallery and end credits without text.
0307454541|1.0|Very disappointed.  Placed my order and weeks went by and still had not received the order.  Finally reached out to the vendor and never heard back. Apparantely, this is not not the first time.  Amazon should be more careful with their vendor partners.

0618918248|2.0|My view on this book is that it's too long with chapters that are full of ongoing philosophical rambling by an intelligent man who is not a philosopher. This book should've lost half of its weight. Having said that, some ideas in that book were very radically innovative and impressive. Actually, I wished he elaborated more on those briefly mentioned ideas that he advocated. I was intrigued by his idea not to identify children with labels like Christian, Hindu or Sikh, till they read adulthood and make those decisions on their own. I don't agree with it, however, because of many flaws in that concept. With such theory, many questions arise, whether it is pragmatic at all, and if it's tantamount to asking parents to bury their heritage, religious or otherwise, and not to pass it on to their offspring. A child is born with many labels, regardless if the child likes them or not. Some of them are religious but many others are not. Not only a child could by hypothetically a Hindu child, but also French or Gypsy, male or female, Autistic, illegitimate, prodigy, bipolar or blond. We inherit these labels as a part of our human condition and some are changeable and some are not.    The two ideas that I must praise:    1. As Dawkins calls for and defends atheism, he asks nonbelievers not to try to eliminate religious heritage and \\"holy\\" books. He actually believes that the readers who do not believe in the supernatural, should still retain and even participate in religious rituals as a way of keeping traditions alive, in terms of marriage, funerals, etc. It's an amazing idea that solves many social problems in the conflict between believers and nonbelievers. I find this idea contradictory to advocate protecting of religous heritage, while, as I mentioned earlier, asking parents to entirely abandon religious labels with their own children based on their beliefs.    2. Teach the so-called holy books in schools as part of literature classes, so children would appreciate the linguistic beauty that endured over centuries and its influence on many languages.

0307266303|5.0|What a fantastic novel about a fantastic race of people and the \\"races\\" of these ultra distance runners. I am a runner and run barefoot as much as possible, but these exploits are incredible. My interest was sparked by a fellow runner who had read this book, and I had heard of the tribe while living in Mexico years ago. But by buying this book and reading it, my mind was racing through the whole gamut of memories and past running moments. Absolutely amazing is what this tribe does and how they survie in the desolation of huge, mountainous canyons in Northern Mexico. Any runner or any person interested in humanity itself will be enthralled by this novel. Run barefoot to your nearest bookstore or race to your computer and get this book!

B001IF252C|3.0|There are few iterations of this adapter (I've had them all and exchanged/sold them until I found how to solve the issues).    There are 3 firmware versions - 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03. The problem is that one cannot say without opening the box and connecting both to the computer and to a monitor what is the installed firmware. Even worse, the adapter's firmware is not upgradeable (by the end-user or thru Apple Menu / Software Update). After connecting both to the computer and to the monitor - you can find the installed firmware of the adapter at Apple menu / About This Mac / More Info... / Hardware / Graphics/Display and scroll down to see if it the 1.01, 1.02 or 1.03. Only the 1/03 works reliably with the non-Apple branded 2560 x 1600 monitors.    Now - you can go and hassle with the Apple Geniuses at the Apple Store. The product has 1 year warranty and _should_ be replaced by them (good luck with that - I had to go several times to them to find someone willing to exchange and open the box and install the adapter and check that is the 1.03 firmware...)    Overall it finally works (I have two), but only with the 1.03 firmware.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|World War Z is a fictional account of a Zombie outbreak across the planet.  It's also a social commentary.  It's not thinly veiled and Brooks makes little attempt to hide it which I liked.  The story is told by multiple points of view, though we do get to hear from some of the characters more than once.  Sometimes I wanted to hear more from characters and sometimes I was ready to move on.  I liked how many of the characters had heard of each other and how their lives intertwined.  It was a sort of six degrees of separation.  I really enjoyed this book and I kind of wonder if that's what it would be like if undead attacked - how people would react and how the aftermath of such a war would change the world as we know it.  I did think that the book ended abruptly.  I thought it was going to end with the second to last chapter.  When it didn't, I expected there would be more to the story as a whole.
0316069485|5.0|New hardback.  Connelly writes a great story. Arrived in promised time frame and packed well.
B000HC2LI0|2.0|I bought this as a present for my dad who is a huge fan of this show.  Lets just say yes, this is a great show, but this series is not worth buying at full price.  When this came out, it was $299.99 at Target but I waited until the price came down as I felt that was too much for this set, and I was correct.  Luckily, I bought this set off of ebay for $79 dollars, brand new, with free shipping.  Thats a great/fair price for this set, imo.  I just gave this set to my dad on Nov 1st, 2010 as a present.  As he opened it, he was impressed and surprised, but I was a bit embarassed.  Why?  Because, when he opened the dvds, they were scattered about and falling everywhere!  Yes, this set was New in box, but they really cut corners on how they packaged the DVDS!!!!  They are in these cheap, flimsy plastic holders that once are torn open, you can not reuse for storage.  And then you have to store the dvd's in these cardboard like fake files which scratch the dvd's!!!  What a shoddy job on packaging!  Imagine going into a McDonalds and ordering a Bic Mac and having them serve it to you wrapped in yesterday's newspaper---(to save money on packaging)--yea, that was my reaction when my dad opened this present.  Seriosuly, this set is not worth full price, at this time, you should be able to buy it around 75-100 dollar range on ebay.  I would not pay over 100 for this set due to the shoddy way to store and protect the dvd's.  The content on the dvd's itself is wonderful, but you will need to store them in hardcover cases if you wish to keep them from getting scratched!

B003YK42LQ|2.0|I'm disappointed in this album, to say the least. I first got into KOL with their Youth and Young Manhood album, and I like to hear them when they wallow in the dirty guts of southern rock. They were the best at it, when they did it. And I admired them greatly for it. I liked Only by the Night too, it was a terrific album, and when they played it slow they played it slow memorably. There were thought-provoking moments in songs like Revelry, and Cold Desert.     I have read other reviews on here about how I cannot compare this album to their earlier works. And I say why not? I can compare this album to any other album I want. Even an album they didn't perform on. My opinion doesn't change, I just gain new insights and fresh perspective into how disappointing this album really is.    Now allow me to explain why. It's not because this album isn't thrashing about in southern rock riffs... it's because there is NO PASSION to this album whatsoever. What Caleb did so well on previous albums was, no matter how the song's tempo was, he poured it out in his rugged soulful way on those tracks. He felt those songs in his bones, and as a result you could feel them too.    The closest I think he gets to that on this album are with the tracks, Radioactive and Pyro. On Pyro I hear a little of the old Caleb wail, and it puts me in touch with something inside me on an emotional level. But it still falls way short of the mark of anything I've ever heard before. This albums sounds like it was produced and edited over and over until all emotion was replaced with a cool distant outdoor sound. Which is great for watching lightning bugs on the back porch. But folks, I listen to KOL to FEEL. To feel alive, to feel lust, longing, redemption, even sadness. If I wanted the cool distance this album offers me I would just listen to the Eagles all day long. Mary, for example, sounds like I'm back at the high school homecoming listening to a no-name band playing a forgettable cover.    This albumreminds me faintly of a band I know and have loved for a long time. So I just pop one of their albums in. As Knocked Up starts blaring through my speakers I am reminded of what really really good rock n roll is, and how sometimes in the process people can lose themselves. KOL, I hope you find yourselves again soon, and quit playing knockoff uninspiring tunes. Can't wait to hear another album like Because of the Times, and soon!

B0042AEOG0|4.0|This album will fail to produce as many holiday classics as her first Christmas album. The leading single \\"Oh Santa!\\" is no where near as timeless as \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" managed to be off the first album. To be honest, when I heard that single a few weeks before the release of the album, my hopes were dashed.    After seeing a tracklist featuring many traditional songs, I got very excited thinking that there would be some of Mariah's old style in there. However, many of these songs are MEDLEYS, which is something else entirely. That being said SOME of these medleys are good:    O Little Town of Bethlehem / Little Drummer Boy (Medley)  Oh Come All Ye Faithful / Hallelujah Chorus (Feat. Patricia Carey) and  The First Noel / Born is the King (Interlude) (excluding the awful interlude)    These songs are three of my favorite \\"classic\\" Christmas songs that manage to showcase SOME of Mariah's original styling and vocal strength. Also, her original song \\"Christmas Time Is In The Air Again\\" is also a pretty lovely song, as is \\"One Child.\\"    Some songs where ruined by overly liberal artistic alterations, in my opinion. Those being \\"Here Comes Santa Clause\\" and \\"Auld Lang Syne.\\" Though I am learning to accept the jarring changes and am beginning to enjoy/sing them. Darn!    4 Stars. I have too many things that I dislike about the album to give it a perfect score, and too great a love of Christmas music to score it any less.
0195145925|5.0|Written both for the popular-science market and for scientists and philosophers, only the latter shall fully enjoy this remarkable book. Because they have developed their mind's eye, enabling them to see four-dimensional space-time or Riemannian spaces just as clearly as everyone can see a thing extended in two directions.   The author argues that the apparent passage of time is an illusion. If we could stand outside the universe and see it 'as it is', it would appear to be static. This radical conclusion is reached by considering the most basic structure of Einstein's general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, the two fundamental theories of physics.   In particular, time is treated in completely different ways in the two theories. This presents a severe problem, since all serious workers in the field are convinced that the two theories must eventually be subsumed in a single over-arching theory. This will be the quantum theory of the universe (also called quantum gravity). The finding of this theory presents many great difficulties, of which the problem of time is perhaps the most severe. It seems that a choice has to be made between two irreconcilable notions of time. The author argues that the only satisfactory solution is to abolish time altogether and outlines a timeless quantum theory of the universe.   Is included a proposed solution to one of the most intractable problems of physics : what is the origin of the so-called arrow of time? Why is it that all phenomena distinguish a common direction of time (i.e., why does entropy increase?), but the equations of physics are symmetric with respect to the direction of time? The equations of physics allow not only the shattering of a cup that is dropped on the floor but also the re-assembly of the pieces. However, that is never observed. A theory of the universe should explain why entropy increases.   'The End of Time' suggests that a fundamental asymmetry in the space of all the possible structures of the universe could provide a basis for the arrow of time.   Not highly readable, nor accessible to the layman; but profound, original and creative, this book deserves five stars.
0971407614|3.0|The methods, exercises, programs and experience in this book are genuine; I know first hand that they work well for the men that Mark Lauren claims to have trained (and of course he has trained many).  I've never heard of the publisher before but judging by the other books written and the editing quality aforded to this book, I don't think the publisher is a very well known or successful one.  The book is poorly organized, redundant, long-winded and quite honestly boring for the majority.  The author often claims that \\"science\\" says this or that, but does not site what qualifies the science or who did studies that suggest science might back up any claims.  A lot of insider jokes and jargon are presented with little or incorrect explaination of origination.  At a few places the book attempts to be religiously sensitive by suggesting that creation and evolution are equivalent and interchangeable concepts (Why these ideas are in a fitness book is beyond me).  Yet the subtitle itself claims that the book is a \\"bible\\" [lower case intended], which of course is offensive to many people who take religion seriously.  The offensive subtitle and any religious allusions should have been left out considering it adds nothing and is way outside the scope of this book.  Overall, I DO NOT recommend the book for reading enjoyment, scientific accuracy, or self motivation; all of which apear as though they are supposed to be profound but turn out to be dismal failures.  I recomend skipping right to the exercises and programs.  Mark Lauren DOES have the experience and HAS conducted enough personal observation to make his fitness claims.  If you want a book purely for new ideas in fitness routines or excercises, and a program that WILL work, this book delivers what it offers.

If you are wondering if you should buy this album, stop wondering right now and buy it. You will enter a world of incomparable melodies mixed with technical precision and talent. Not only can Rush deliver the kick ass riffs that give a serious rocker what they NEED, but they also write songs that have great melody and structure. Did I mention the lyrics are incredible too? Just get the album, and when you listen to it, you will want to buy 2112, and Signals, and Test For Echo, etc, etc...

0307474712|5.0|Having just finished the book, I came on to see what others thought about it.  I was quite surprised to see how much was given away in people's descriptions.  I enjoyed the fact that the book didn't always go the way I thought it would, even early on or in the middle.  If you appreciate that aspect of a story, I recommend steering clear of the details of most reviews.  If I hadn't, some parts of the narrative would have had much lesser of an impact.    Ultimately, I found this book to a realistic one that described the ups and downs and ins and outs of a relationship very well.  The dialog felt real as did how the characters interacted with one another.  The author also had a great flair for descriptions throughout.  And finally, once you got used to the structure (after 3 or 4 chapters), you could see how Nicholls cleverly took advantage of his unique approach and enhanced his storytelling with it.    Two more notes -- this was very British, using locations and words and comments on accents that would only make full sense to natives.  Still, me being an American, I don't think I missed anything significant.  I got the gist.  The other note is that some have described this as \\"Chick Lit\\" and it appears to have been marketed as such.  My take on it though is that it rises above what one stereotypically thinks of as Chick Lit.  It feels like an intelligent, well-written book.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Wow...is all you can say after watching this.  I have to honestly say I never took that much of an interest in the food I purchased or what it was made of until I had a child, and then that interest grew exponentially.  The future our food and our culture and our society is in grave danger.  I honestly had no clue about most of the information presented in this video and was just shocked.  Knowing what I do now, I absolutely feel the need to learn more, and do more - to make sure I can do as much for my child's development and her future child's as well.    We need to change our outlook on what we eat, how it's made and produced and prepared...so many of us are uninformed or misinformed - I HIGHLY recommend this movie!!

B00012FXB8|1.0|Alien 3 is a huge disappointment.  While this movie was in its pre-production and production phases it was obvious that it was going to be a disaster - there was no direction or vision of the logical next steps in the Alien franchise.  The first two movies were amazing - both unique and entertaining in their own way.  Alien 3 begins with ruining everything Ripley fought for in Aliens by immediately killing off the survivors and then transitions into a bleak and dull storyline that trashes the franchise.  I always envisioned subsequent Alien movies to delve into the mystery  of the derelict ship on LV-426 and create a situation where Earth had to be defended from infestation from the Aliens.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and basically ignore that it was ever made.  In my mind Ripley, Hicks, Newt, and Bishop returned to Earth and the story stopped or moved on from there.
0380730405|4.0|WHAT is this book about?<br /><br />Although I doubt I need to recount the plot as I'm probably one of the few people who hadn't read this book before 2010, I'll write it like an equation:<br /><br />A big house + A young new wife + A rich but distant husband ÷ A dead wife X A sinister housekeeper = A wonderfully creepy story of misunderstandings, secrets and murrrrddddeeeer.<br /><br />WHO do we meet?<br /><br />* The second Mrs. DeWinter is a naive, innocent young woman who is working as a companion for an insufferably snobby woman when she meets ....<br />* Maximilian DeWinter, a wealthy older man who is vacationing in Monte Carlo.

When I posted my list of RIP books, almost everyone commented about how much they loved Rebecca. I loved it too! It is one of the few \\"classics\\" that really lived up to the hype. DuMaurier does a fantastic job of slowly building up the dread and suspense. You get inside the second Mrs. DeWinter's mind and you just squirm and feel this sense of impending doom. Everywhere she goes, it is Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca. And she is so innocent and trusting that she bumbles along getting herself deeper and deeper enmeshed in the secrets of Manderley. I read somewhere when I was Googling around for the images used above, that Rebecca is really more of a psychological haunting than a physical haunting, and I thought that was a fantastic description.

The automatic movement is great for this price point.    Keeps time well thus far, and the nylon band is actually pretty classy.  Works with formal or causal.    If you're looking for a basic \\"starter\\" watch but want it to be automatic instead of quartz, this is THE ideal watch...for $65 you get a well-respected brand, automatic movement, nice looks, and adaptability.
0316077054|4.0|I devoured this book in just a days time. I am absolutely in love with this series and in anxious anticipation of the third book!<br /><br />In the sequel to Beautiful Creatures, we learn what happens after Lena's sixteeenth birthday Claiming. After uncle Macon's death, Lena is not the same. She is depressed and pulls away from Ethan. Then Ethan finds out she's been hanging out with another guy, John for a while and he never knew it. He works the summer with his aunt Marian and meets her assistant, Liv.<br /><br />While he tries to work through Lena's rejection, his jealousy and fears of his relationship being over with Lena, he subtly begins to feel things for Liv. She helps him, throughout the book, along with Link of course and they spend a good portion of the book chasing Lena, who has run off with John and another bad seed we all know. Link also has some drama of his own and is present and a very indepth character in this book. We also get alot of new faces and alot of reaquantinces that keep the story alive and interesting.<br /><br />Just like the first, it was well written, well handled. In my review of the first book, I commented on how I loved it that there wasn't any love triangles... so when I started reading about John, I groaned and was upset, but once I got into the meat of the story I felt a little better. They handled the other love interest of Ethan and Lena with tact and understanding. But now I can't wait for the third book, to resolve this because alot of things were unanswered and undealt with when the book ended between Ethan and Lena. I only gave it four stars because of the ending. I felt they could have ellaborated a little, there just seems to be so many things left flailing to be resolved in the third.<br /><br />Also Link. His story will have to come front and center, which I'm anxious to read about in the third book, but I hope it dosen't overshadow Lena and Ethan's story, because it definately isn't over.<br /><br />I have no doubt Kami and Margaret will come through with a brilliant third book if they stick to the precepts of the previous books.a brilliant third book if they stick to the precepts of the previous books.

B00275EHJG|4.0|Many of you, I know, will think I'm crazy for giving this any less than 5 stars. People love their Toy Story, I'm aware. There's a serious over-hype for this movie that I just don't understand, but maybe that's just me; since the Toy Story series has never been one of my favorites. Give me The Incredibles or Finding Nemo any day. But, nevertheless, I did enjoy this movie very much; it's just not my favorite.  In terms of adventure this is definitely the best of the three, with stealthy escape sequences and enthralling action you'll always be at the edge of your seat. There's a very intense scene towards the end, where the toys are about to be incinerated that really had me concerned, and I'm not even that fond of them. I can only imagine the anxiety of someone who does have excessive compassion for these little guys- especially young kids for which it may be a bit too much.    Visually speaking the Toy Story universe is looking better than ever with Pixar's advances made in cg animation since their last appearance in 1999. When you think about it, it really is amazing how far the folks at Pixar have come since their first film.                                                            *SPOILER ALERT*  There is one thing that I really can't ignore, and that was the idiotic ending, where ANDY JUST GIVES THEM AWAY TO SOME STARANGE LITTLE GIRL! What made it even more maddening was the fact that for more than half the movie the goal for escape is to get back to Andy, because even if Andy is grown up they're still HIS toys. That was part of what made Toy Story special- their loyalty to Andy. Another maddening factor is that Andy was going to put them in the attic! But Woody at the last minute writes a note, requesting that Andy donates them to a little girl named Bonnie- a little girl that Andy's never even met before? Come ON Pixar, you're BETTER than this!   A much better ending would have been Andy putting them in the attic, then later coming back to retrieve them when he has kids of his own who'll play with them.                                                    *END SPOILER ALERT*    Overall, this is a very good film. Definitely the best one yet, making an average sendoff for the trilogy I give it 3.5 out of 5.

0307454541|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the first book in a trilogy of books by Stieg Larsson. The book follows the story of Swedish journalist Mikael Blomkivst and his \\"research assistant\\" Lisbeth Salander on their quest to find the truth about a woman who vanished forty years earlier. The book is a suspenseful thriller filled with many twists and turns, as well as the unexpected.<br />  The novels are set in Sweden in modern day time.  You learn a lot about the country and rules through the novel as well as Stieg Larsson's view and opinion on Sweden and the Nazis (the author himself was a leading expert in antidemocratic right-wing extremist and Nazi organizations).  I found being American is not a problem in following the story as Larsson sets it up and basically brings you to Sweden, explaining how the land is set up, how the cities are set up as well as even bringing you along for a drive on the freeways.<br />  Lisbeth is a complex character, she's hard to understand, we don't know any of her secrets and we don't find out many of them in the first novel.  The book is left hanging on her final sentences, wishing we could only know a little bit more. Lisbeth is brash, irrational, and a wildcard type of character. She's the character the trilogy is hinged on and it's her character that makes you run out and pick up the second and third books.<br />  I can't express in words the level of praise I have for the novels.  They are some of the best books I've ever read and I'm sad that the author has died because I will only be left wanting more of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist when the final novel is put down.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|I buy A LOT of music - all genres.  I'm not a particularly rabid Blues fan, but anyone who knows musis knows (about) Buddy Guy.  Wow, this should be tops on any music lover's list this year.  Buddy starts off proclaiming \\"I'm 74 years old\\" and then shreds the most vicious guitar chords I've heard in quite some time.  With references to playing for to Kings, drinking with The Rollling Stones, musical support from BB King and Santana, this CD just overwhelms the listner with a sublime listening experience.  More confirmation of who some of the early British Invasion bands (Led Zeppelin) were studying.  This is nearly sacred good music.
B003WTE886|4.0|Have you ever watched a movie review where the critics lambast a horror movie, or an animated cartoon, or a comedy as if it were designed with an Oscar in mind?  That irritates me to no end.  You have to look at things for what they are, and this is exactly what Taylor Swift is, a Taylor Swift album of young lyrics and very palatable radio-esque hooks.    Overall, it leans further away from the country side of things and leans closer to crossover, especially with tunes like 'Better Than Revenge' which is very very Avril-ish.  And, considering her main target audience, it fits like a glove.    Interestingly, I read a lot of reviews that says it is more personal, and I think lyrically that is true.  However, with music, I go more by pure gut feel, and with the exception of \\"Never Grown Up\\" which shows her emotional vulnerability, I actually hear more confidence with herself musically.    She is no longer the awkward shy gal with the guitar, and it resonates in this album.      Nice Album.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|I really enjoyed very much the novel, and I thought the movie was going to be just like it, but no, it's just sort of an action thriller movie. The worst thing that I didn't like was seeing Charlene interpreted by Robyn Cohen, it seemed to me ridiculous. It could have been a longer film insisting much more on that philosophy and mythology that made the book a best-seller.<br /><br />How wonderful it had been if this modern mythological story would had been directed by Mike Newell of the Prince of Persia, or Uli Edel of The Mist of Avalon or Louis Leterrier of the Clash Of The Titans.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Who cares if it is completely preposterous, Red is great fun all the way.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Richard Dreyfuss and Helen Mirren all increased their net worth through signing up for this movie, and all have a great time.  Several here have argued that it is Malkovich who steals the movie, and when he first appears dressed in some kind of leafed out camouflage, he's off to a great start.  But he has by now taken out the patent on controlled psycho persona, so my vote for most fun goes to Helen Mirren.  It isn't every day that you get to watch The Queen wield heavy weapons with aplomb from a leafy Maryland retirement house, but she does it and makes smashing entertainment with it.  Never mind the plot -- it has something to do with the vice-president or perhaps the evil mastermind (Dreyfuss) manipulating the vice-president somehow subverting the whole of the CIA to their nefarious ends -- because Red is played for entertainment and laughs, not plot sense.  It is a great way to spend a Saturday night, in theaters or at home.

1401324029|4.0|I enjoyed this book better than the first in the series. Although I probably wouldn't have read it if it weren't for the TV series, I think it was written well enough to stand on its own. Not great literature, of course, but the plot was interesting and kept me guessing, and the characterization was good (more for Nikki than Rook, though... he seemed a little out of character in some places - too needy and broody). Otherwise, a good read and worth the time.
0471267554|3.0|I have now read three paleo/primal diet books: this one, Mark Sisson's [[ASIN:0982207700 The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy]], and Robb Wolf's [[ASIN:0982565844 The Paleo Solution: The Original Human Diet]]. This is decidedly my least favorit of the three.     Dr. Cordain has thoroughly bought in to the low-fat conventional wisdom linking high fat intake to heart disease, which I think is refuted by a book, Gary Taubes' [[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health (Vintage)]] (see also 'What If It Is All A Big Fat Lie?' article in the NYT several years back, if you want to try his thoughts on for free).  I think research supports that saturated fat is not the evil that has been claimed since the 1960s, and furthermore, when you look into it, protein toxicity issues and sheer preference led native peoples to eat fattier animals if they had a choice between fattier and leaner.     At any rate, while I applaud Cordain for wanting to help, and I think cutting grains and sugar out of the diet is a good idea, this is not the paleo eating book of choice. You could sum it up quite easily: grains are bad, so is dairy, but so is fat. Eat more protein. That's not revolutionary. Thankfully he did inspire a number of other people who wrote better books.     The recipes in the book by and large were not terribly appealing, and much of it is further not well presented on the Kindle, where I read it. Robb Wolf's The Paleo Solution had some tasty-looking recipes and also appropriately focuses on sleep and stress in addition to diet.  The bibliography and research in the back of the book was excellent, as well. (However, the much-touted website in the Paleo Solution is not worth your time.) Mark Sisson's The Primal Blueprint has a more accurate stance on fat, I think, and good ideas for exercise. The Primal Blueprint is a little too gimmicky for me, and I disliked the focus on the supplements he sells, but overall it was good (I wish it had the same references provided by Wolf.)     Maybe you gain something by reading all three, but all in all, this was my least favorite.
B003U9V6A6|5.0|I absolutely love this album!  I fell in love with The Script about 1 1/2 years ago and was going to see them in Chicago Oct 23rd.  I waited and waited for the new CD to be released but there was not an American release scheduled. So, I ordered the import from Amazon for a few dollars more, and it was so worth it!  Not only could I enjoy the entire concert because I now had both of their albums, but this CD is even better than the first!  Don't wait for the American release, order the import now!

0321647440|5.0|I think this instruction book is very simple to use. I wish though that it included bullet point summaries at the end of sections, to help the reader connect the dots in a way that helps them remember what they just learned and/or to come back to for a fast refresher weeks or months down the line without having to read the whole thing from scratch just to answer a question or solve an impasse. The \\"Concept\\" portion at the end of chapters/sections does some of that but not in a way that I find clears the cobwebs enough, but it is great to have. All in all, get this book!
031603438X|5.0|I just finished the book, and I LOVE IT! Its only flaw is that it's too short, despite the 600 pages. I want to know more! How I wish there could be a part 2 with everything he forgot or left out in part 1.   It's written in the same language that Keith uses when he talks, and you can easy imagine him telling you everything that you read, in his unique Keithesque way. And it's all there: his childhood, the early Stones, Anita, feuds with Mick, etc. And lots and lots of funny little tales about people and incidents. And off course the recipe for his favorite meal, bangers! If you love Keith, you will love this book. I'm so glad he managed to get this done, before it's too late. Thanks, Keef!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|Not to say the Eagles should never write and produce again, but this release could have very well been their swan song, had they wished. Flawless song selection and performance. Plus, they should have never resorted to going forward sans Don Felder. Sure, he's only one member, one guitar, but he gave so much feel and spirit to the group. Henley and Frey will forever be a historical songwriting team, but they will never be able to produce 220 volts without Felder. He is a force they will never be able to replace or reproduce. This production very may well have been their last.....great gift to fans. Buy this and don't ever look back! Henley and Frey, retire if you don't ever work with the great Felder again.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Its finally here, the third installment to the ground breaking animated film. We all remember watching the first Toy Story when we were younger. Now we are much older and some even have kids who are just watching the series for the first time.     First off, the story is perfect. Andy is all grown up and going to college (we all have grown up) and the toys dont know what their fate is whether its the attic, garbage or donation. After a mixup, Woody, Buzz and the rest of the game find themselves in a strange and unknown territory...daycare. There they think they found their belonging. A place where they never get old as when kids grow up..new kids come. But soon they find out things arent what they seen.    For a kids movie, this can be considered scary with intense scenes that might scare some kids. Also at times, you have a tear in your eyes as the movie has its sad scenes.     Almost of the major actors return with the exception of Jim Varney (Slinky Dog) who died shortly after the 2nd movie. In his place is Blake Clark who sounds just like him.     Sometimes the movie gets weird..especially the character of Big Baby who kind of creeped me out a bit.    The movie is loaded with special features:  *Commentary  *Day And Night Theatrical Short- A very funny and imaginative cartoon that is very entertaining   *Bonus: The Gang's All Here-A documentary on the returning cast and new cast members.  *Toys!- A documentary on making the toys in the movie  *Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: The Science Of Adventure (with NASA)- A little short with Buzz talking to Rex, Ham and Mr. Potato Head about experiments in space with Nasa  *Paths To Pixar: Editorial- A short documentary with the editors talking about how they got into the business.  *Studio Stories: Where's Gordon, Cereal Bar, Clean Start- Short cartoons commentated by some of the crew about what went on during behind the scenes.  *A Toy's Eye View: Creating A Whole New Land- The making and contructing of the upcoming Toy Story park in Disney World.  *Alex Syntek (Mexican Music Video for You've Got a Friend in Me)    Great movie to own. If you love the originals. Get this. Its as good as the originals (if not better)

B003WTE886|5.0|When I saw Taylor Swift on the MTV awards doing Innocent I played it over and over again. The lyrics are outstanding and it showed how big her heart is and how forgiving.    I listened closely to the lyrics and it was almost as if she was speaking to Kanye West directly. Very poignant depiction of childhood, losing the comfort and innocence of being a child having your parents to make you feel safe .      We all make mistakes and as she says lost your balance on a tight rope but you can start over at any time your only 32 your still growing up now.  It sounds as a though a friend has been hurt but they realize their friend is going thru a tough time and no love lost.    Brillant song righter you nailed it.
B0036EH3X4|4.0|Lost season 6 is my least favorite season of Lost, but still worth watching.<br /><br />It did not answer any of the mysteries from previous seasons. I liked the mysteries, but I was hoping there was at least a degree of meaning behind them. There was no meaning. Season 6 introduces even more mysteries without answering previous ones.<br /><br />People say \\"The show was about the characters and not the plot.\\" I understand their point. Lost's characters have more depth than any fictional characters I have ever known. I appreciate that, and that's why I love the show. But I still wish the story made more sense. Supposedly, having a more substantive plot would subtract from the depth of the characters. I guess that makes sense.<br /><br />Overall, I still liked season 6, just less so than other seasons. I am glad the show concluded while it was still good and exciting.
0399226907|5.0|\\"In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf\\" - we read on the first page. Then the egg turns into a very hungry and greedy caterpillar who doesn't stop eating all kinds of human foods. He goes through a whole week of eating, day by day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... with amount of foods accumulating progressively. As a result, the caterpillar becomes very fat and he gets sick  from all that food - until he nibbles on a leaf, and only then he feels much better. On the last pages caterpillar spins himself into a cocoon and soon he turns into a beautiful butterfly!<br /><br />The predictable words, rhymes and rhythm are fun as well as educational: kids can learn about nature, shapes and types of foods, counting, and days of the week. The book also stands out with bright colors and clever die-cut artwork (each page has a hole where the caterpillar ate the food item). Also the pages progress in size which makes it fun for a child.<br /><br />Overall, this book brings a sense of wonder and amazement to kids as they see metamorphose from the egg to the caterpillar to the cocoon and eventually to the beautiful butterfly. It's almost magic or ,at least, it certainly will be to a young child.<br /><br />Julia Shpak<br />Author of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

B001B7CNY2|4.0|This movie is a fast paced world war two action/suspense movie.  It will leave you on the edge of your seat the entire time.  A simple story about a secret mission by the Navy joined with special ops to take the German Inigma machine from a damaged U-boat.  Instead of a smooth mission (when are the missions smooth?) it becomes a chase and a fight for survival to avoid German attacks along the sea.  Good special effects, GREAT sound, and a suspenseful movie!

0439023513|1.0|It seems many people did not understand the ending of Mockingjay. All I have to say is that many things were clear to me in the beginning, I knew from early on that:    -Katniss needed Peeta for his love / understanding / strong character  -Gale would not end up with Katniss because of differences in morals  -Coin was a threat (sent Peeta to kill Katniss) and did horrible things like torture, killing children, and proposing another hunger games  -Katniss only agreed to the hunger games to gain trust and kill Coin    So basically some of the ending made sense to me but this is why I didn't like the ending:    -Finnick is developed into a great character and then killed in one sentence with no emotion attached  -Prim is killed the same way  -After Katniss realizes that she loves Peeta she does not pursue him at all (Did not anyone want her to help the real Peeta return?)  -Peeta comes back brainwashed and destroyed and what does Katniss do? \\"Forget you, I'm leaving now, bye.\\"  -There is little depth and explanation near the end of the book (Epilogue)  -Katniss spends most of the book hiding, crying, running or sleeping in the hospital  -\\"Happy ending\\" scenario with Katniss and kids except its not happy at all and I don't buy it. That felt empty and depressing.  -I didn't believe the Katniss + Peeta relationship at the end, it felt like something the author made up because she was running out of time     *Yes I understand war is sad and pointless (Finnick and Prim died) but it feels forced and used as an excuse not to give anyone a meaningful death.    Too many possibilities for a better ending and the fact that we were left with emotionless / depressing / rushed garbage I just can't give this book a good review because I don't see myself ever reading it again.    -------    The only part I enjoyed in this book is when Katniss talks to President Snow and finds out what Coin did. It's like Snow knows he is beaten so he just helps Katniss along at this point to see whatwill happen. Following that Katniss kills Coin and Snow dies laughing at the fact that she actually went through with it (and it's all one big joke now).
B00433QE3M|3.0|Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of all time smells so strongly of commercial pandering  it's not surprising to learn the concept was the brain child of Clive Davis and Carlos Santana resisted the idea for a long time before finally agreeing to it.  It's a shame because it presents Carlos with a no win situation. If these songs are truly \\"The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time\\" (a debatable proposition) then improving on them would make this literally the greatest guitar album of all time. This is an unfair burden for the guitarist to bear.<br />So, what worked, what didn't and why?<br /> \\"Crossroads\\", which quotes Guns and Roses \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" in the intro, works.  Carlos keeps the signature guitar lick but strips it down to make room for the added Latin percussion which supplies this remake with more forward momentum than the original. Carlos' guitar playing hangs with the original which is no easy feat. Finally, guest vocalist Rob Thomas turns in a beautiful vocal performance. This recording may be better than the original.<br /> \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is also a success. Vocalist India.Arie and cellist Yo-Yo Ma turn in beautiful, delicate performances over a modern R&B ballad groove that Santana decorates with mostly understated electric AND ACOUSTIC guitar fills. It is interesting to note that the two best songs on the album are linked to Eric Clapton, on odd coincidence but nothing more.<br />Also of interest is Smoke on the Water which uses a borrowed Led Zeppelin lick to serve as counter point to the signature riff and features a solid vocal by Jacoby Shaddix of Papa Roach. As with Sunshine of Your Love, the Latin style percussion drives this cut forward and the stars fiery guitar holds its own when compared to the original.<br /> Lastly, Back in Black features the rapper NAS, an all female backing chorus and instrumental snippets from Buck Cherry's song \\"Crazy Bitch\\". The conga drums fit in with the big block chords and hard rock drums beautifully. Another success.<br /> That's the good news. The bad news? Let's start with Def Leppards \\"Photograph\\". While elsewhere the additional percussion added drive, here it just gets in the way of the drums. As for the vocal, it lacks the fire and enthusiasm of the original, replacing it with a smoothness that just doesn't suit the tune. Carlos and the band do not own this song. They merely play it.<br /> They try to own Bang a Gong but miss the mark. The songs original sparse arrangement, which allowed all the parts to breath and interact, is replaced with clutter. The percussion fills most of the space and the guitar swallows up what's left. The vocal lacks the originals playfully sinister vibe.<br />As for the rest, it's somewhere in the middle. Chris Cornell turns in a fine vocal performance on Whole Lotta Love but there was simply no room for improvement. Nor does the band bring anything new to the Stones Can't You Hear Me Knocking. On Riders on the Storm, the added percussion is a nice change but the extra guitar disrupts the atmosphere and the vocal lacks the vague air of menace that informed the original. Not bad, just not as good as the original.<br /><br />All of these songs, except Photograph, deserve a listen but I only hear four that really call you back over and over.  Four successes in twelve attempts may be great for a baseball player but it's a disappointment for an artist of Carlos Santana's magnitude.lly. Another success.   That's the good news. The bad news?

B000050FEN|5.0|Seven has a stellar cast (Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, R. Lee Erny, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey), and a realistic plot, The killer John Doe and the deaths could very well happen in real life. The fact that it seems like it could happen makes it more shocking. The premise is simple a killer kills people according to the seven deadly sins and two detectives are on the trail to catch him. Many Classical books are quoted and used in the movie (The Merchant of Venice (Shakespeare), The Divine Comedy (Dante Alighieri), Canterbury tales (Chauncer), Paradise Lost (Milton), which makes it a highly cerebral film. The grittiness of the film also makes it an attractive thriller. If you like thrillers or detective shows and can handle grotesque crime scenes, then this is the film for you (I personally had bought the special edition (Black Case) because I love extras. There are plenty of extras so you will not be disappointed with \\"WHAT'S IN THE BOX!\\" 10/10
0375842209|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the Book Thief. The beginning is a bit strange and leaves kind of a hollow feeling as the book is narrated by death. But the story of the bonds created and then broken by tragedy is something we can all relate to.     The story was so well written I feel as though I spent time on the street of the main character and I feel her pain and loss.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|The title says it all! Even though I don't have an eating disorder, I have been obsessive about calories, types of foods and the time of day I chose to eat my meals. I'm actually at a good weight of 120 pounds for being a little over five feet and it took reading this book to realize it. I love her writing style! Her thoughts on her eating disorder weren't like you would expect. She was aware of when she got too thin and that surprised me. She is very detailed and open. I urge you to read this book.

0156027321|4.0|I really liked this novel, even though at the time I had been required by a course to read it.    I found Martel's storytelling to be right on point, and I loved the twist at the end - I won't ruin it for you. Though the scenery was mainly static for the majority of the novel, I think the author did a great job keeping that static from turning into stagnant. Being drawn out just enough suspense-wise to keep you guessing, it was an effective move. The 'island' in the novel was also a fantastic addition - I was unaware such things are even rumored to exist.    The ending was a little ripe in my opinion, but outside of that it was a solid 4/5.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Taken surprised me. I thought it might be good, but I didn't realize how good. Taken is harsh, intense, prejudicial, and it packs a not-so-subtle punch.<br /><br />If the Star Wars series wasn't qualification enough, Liam Neeson has now stepped into the ranks of the finest action heroes. He is superb in the role. The stunt work and car chases rank with Bourne or better.<br /><br />I won't go into descriptive plot details, except to say -- nothing could be more primal to the gut than to have your own daughter kidnapped. On this premise, ex-spy-operative Bryan Mills (Neeson) is now granted a  license to leave a trail of dead bodies in his wake as he conducts a vengeful search for his kidnapped 17 year old daughter in the most corrupt dens of Paris.<br /><br />Mill's rampage seems justified, and throughout this amped-up movie I found myself screaming \\"DO IT!\\" as he slaughtered one bad guy after another. The unrelenting drive and ingenuity of Mills as he races against time is what makes this movie so interesting.<br /><br />Still, while my lower brain gleefully submits to the revenge killing, my conscience is disturbed. This film also happens to be perfect to show to future troops the US Government would send into the Middle East or Eastern Europe, with the troubling, simplistic message \\"Keep our children safe.\\"<br /><br />\\"Taken\\" implicitly concludes that torture and murder are OK (in fact, ultra-cool) in the commission of a rescue; in other words, the end justifies the means -- Which seems to be the intrinsic, inescapable, primal message of Taken. And there is a strong thread of xenophobia against brown-skinned people that for me sends up a red caution flag.<br /><br />It's evil subplot of a criminal culture that is auctioning young girls for prostitution is also reminiscent of the earlier 1970's film, \\"Prime Cut.\\"<br /><br />A very enjoyable thriller, but with no-so-nice political and racial overtones.

B001AQO3XS|5.0|I just watched this on my old Laser Disc from the early 1990s this weekend.  Tonight I watched the Blu-Ray Director's Cut 2010 version!    Generally I hate director's cuts.  I want the theatrical version, and I want the director to stick a fork in it and call it done.   But this is the exception.    Technically,  they did a GREAT JOB  lifting this copy from the master.    How can you tell?  Because you can tell its stunt doubles and not Lambert or Connery fighting on the cliffs in the Scottish Highlands!  The resolution is that good.    Its much brighter than the other versions as well.  Two full F-Stops brighter would be my guess.      Also,  we Americans finally get a few important deleted scenes that I saw many years ago while in Europe that help tie the story together.  For those who haven't seen it,  lets just say the phrase \\"Hey, it's a kind of magic\\"  will now make sense.  You also will no longer need say \\"So how did the Kurgan know Brenda was his girl friend and just show up at her door step?\\"      They did a great job on the sound too.
B000QFW7UA|3.0|This is a wonderful movie, but the newly released blu-ray version doesn't do it justice. Surely they could have done a better transfer than this. It is extremely grainy in parts, almost like VHS (no I'm not kidding). Blade Runner, which was filmed a couple years before The Goonies, looks much better on blu-ray as does Back to the Future (which was filmed a couple years after). I really don't understand why such a widely loved classic movie got such a so-so treatment when transferred to blu-ray. Bummer. [This is for the new 25th anniversary set]

B000FC2FVA|5.0|I downloaded this about 9 months ago and it sort of lost its place on my MP3 player, meaning after I downloaded it I listened once and forgot all about it.  I refound it a few weeks ago and it gets better and better on each listen.  At first I thought they were a Spoon ripoff, but man they blow Spoon away.  Someone else commented on the lead singer's interspersed \\"Hmphs\\" that he uses in his lyrics.  I find them to be annoying, that is the only negative thing I can say.  Otherwise this has quickly become my favorite CD to listen to lately.  I'm going to check out some of their other stuff seeing as this one is 4 years old.  Better late to the party than never!
1439177783|5.0|Portia De Rossi writes better than alot of authors I've recently read. Her words jump off the page in a way they seem to make sound and I felt like I was hearing her story with my own ears. While her story is heartbreaking, it's beautiful and amazing at the same time. I imagine the process of her writing was a way to heal but it also made me look at myself as well. Her story has been such an inspiration to me and I can't thank her for having the courage to put something into words what so many cannot say themselves.

B0000026VZ|4.0|This 1990 release wasn't a bad G/H album cuz it contained most of Toto's biggest hits like \\"Africa\\", \\"Rosanna\\" & \\"Pamela\\".  It could've been somewhat better though.  The record company did what was typical back in the day in that they omitted a few well known hits from the tracklist & put in 4 new songs instead in order to entice older fans into buying the album.  At first this really bugged me becuz, at the time, I was just a casual Toto fan  & wanted ALL their hits not just most of them.  But I gotta say that the 4 new tracks aren't bad at all & seeing how I think their 80's albums were their very best, it's really nice to hear a few bonus tracks that have that 80's sound to them.  As a matter of fact, I think they are right up there with the groups best songs during the late 80's.  Especially the faster & funkier songs like \\"Animal\\", \\"Love Has The Power\\" & \\"Can You Hear What I'm Saying\\". They are all incredibly catchy pop/rock tunes & some or all of them might've even been hit singles if given the chance.  Jean Michael Byron was brought in to sing all the new songs due to Joseph Williams health problems & eventual firing.  Jean didn't have quite as strong a voice as Joseph but he didn't sound bad either & his R&B voice meshes really well with the new songs. As far as the older tracks go, they are all classics & although not in chronological order, sound great mixed the way that they are.<br /><br />The bigger hits that are missing here are:  \\"I'll Supply the Love\\" (Toto), \\"Goodbye Elenore\\" (Toto 3), \\"Make Believe\\" \\"Afraid of Love\\" & \\"Waiting for Your Love\\" (Toto 4), Everything from (Toto 5) which is unforgivable considering how good it is, \\"Till the End\\" & \\"Without Your Love\\" (Toto 6) and \\"Straight for the Heart\\" from Toto 7.<br /><br />Still a good hits collection but as you can see, there is quite a bit missing and as of this review date, there STILL is no complete Toto collection yet. My advice would be to D/L the 4 bonus tracks from this album & either buy the original albums which have lots of hidden gems on them or buy this G/H and a newer collection & then just grab whatever individual singles that those albums missed.s which have lots of hidden gems on them or buy this G/H and a newer collection & then just grab whatever individual singles that those albums missed.

0792844890|4.0|Mel Brooks had already parodied everything else -- westerns, Hitchcock films, spies, silent movies -- by the time he got to science fiction. The result: \\"Spaceballs,\\" a painfully punny and deliriously wacky little spoof of [[ASIN:B001EN71DG Star Wars]]. It's probably Brooks' goofiest movie (it has a character called BARF!), but it's still loads of fun.<br /><br />The Spaceballs -- led by Colonel Sandurz (George Wyner) and Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) -- are planning to steal all of the peaceful planet Druidia's air. So they try to capture Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga), who has just run away from an arranged marriage to a narcoleptic prince (along with her faithful droid Dot Matrix). Their plan: blackmail the king into turning off the Air Shield, allowing them to suck away the atmosphere!<br /><br />But the princess and Dot are rescued by the rakish mercenary Lone Star (Bill Pullman) and his faithful mog, Barf (John Candy). The unlikely little group soon finds themselves on the sandy planet of Vega, where Lone Star begins to learn about the mystical Schwartz from the merchandising know-it-all Yogurt. But is his Schwartz enough to defeat Dark Helmet's?<br /><br />For the record, this is the least subtle movie Mel Brooks has made. I mean, he's never been a subtle director to begin with, but this movie has so many puns that you can literally see them coming a mile away -- when the President of the Spaceballs starts yelling that he wants them to comb the desert, you know exactly what you'll be seeing in two seconds.<br /><br />And it's pretty darn funny. Brooks takes hilarious pokes at \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Star Trek,\\" \\"Aliens\\" (\\"Oh no... not again!\\") and \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" and there are plenty of fun in-jokes that reflect it (the transporter accident that causes the president to end up, um, facing the wrong way). It does have a few comedy scenes that fall flat, such as when Helmet and Sandurz watch a videotape of, um, their own movie.<br /><br />Brooks also has plenty of fun with the constant merchandising jokes, and he... well, \\"breaking the fourth wall\\" is too gentle a term. Smashing the wall to pieces and dancing on its remains would be more descriptive (\\"God willing, we'll all meet again in Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money\\").<br /><br />You pretty much know what to expect with the characters -- a Han Solo/Luke Skywalker amalgam, the rogue with a heart of gold and a mysterious past; the feisty (whiny) princess (\\"Ith her oyal igness' atched uggage!\\"); the annoying droid, and the shaggy sidekick, as well as slapsticky characters like Yogurt and Pizza the Hut. And of course, the villains -- Brooks has a smallish role as a frustrated president, and Moranis is loads of fun as a dweeby supervillain who still plays with dolls.<br /><br />\\"Spaceballs\\" isn't Brooks' best work, but it is a hilariously goofy sci-fi farce that deserves plenty of watching. Use the Schwartz!with the constant merchandising jokes, and he... well, \\"breaking the fourth wall\\" is too gentle a term.

B000MCIBB6|2.0|To me this is not one of the better Doors recordings. The best thing about this CD is the first song, \\"Hello, I love you.\\" LOVE that song! It goes downhill from there. Especially when it comes to the back to back \\"Summers Almost Gone\\" and \\"Wintertime Love.\\" This is just kind of a mellow Doors album and I really love the Doors when they did \\"Break On Through\\" and \\"Soul Kitchen\\" and \\"Roadhouse Blues.\\" The more rockin' Doors is what I like. If you are into something mellow, by all means lay on your couch and chill to this album. I wish \\"Hello, I love you\\" could have been twice as long. It is a great song, but very short. At least on this re-mixed version they let it go on a little longer.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Toy Story 3 is a beautiful and affecting wrap-up of the Toy Story trilogy. Andy goes off to college and unlike the girls in most Disney animated films, he actually has a living mother. She's the same age as all of us parents who took our children to the original Toy Story films when they were little. All the Toy Story films have been about the sense of time passing and the inevitable sense of loss that goes along with it. Andy's mom, a single mother, is loosing her son and he's ambivalently moving away from her and his childhood, the childhood personified in his beloved toys, especially Woody. The first Toy Story film started with a shot of a cloud-patterned wallpaper in Andy's bedroom. Toy Story 3 begins film ends with the camera panning up into the sky (interestingly, Up ends the same way). The director mentioned during his commentary that this gives the film a \\"storybook\\" quality, but it also gives it a dimension of mystery and becomes a commentary on the transitory nature of life. It's this sense that gives these wonderful films their resonance and makes us able to watch them again and again. Director Lee Unkrich and Producer Darla Anderson's commentary was excellent; they really went out of their way to give credit to all the individual animators and the work done by everyone at Pixar on the film. Generosity like that must make Pixar a great place to work.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|At a small outdoor concert this August, during an intermission, the Love album was played over the sound system. My ears pearked up & listened carefully: this WAS the voice of John, Paul, George & sometimes Ringo, but it WASN'T any of the originally released versions of the song. Since I own all the Beatles, WHAT IS THIS ??    It was the Love album, a remix of 26 of the best of the Beatles by George Martin & his son. Songs include the biggies: Hey Jude, Eleanor Rigby, I Am the Walrus, Help, Within You Without You, LSD, While My Guitar Gentle Weeps, Sgt. Peppers, etc.    A few songs have very minor changes. Most, however, are substantially changed in some way, tho the vocals generally are what we are all intimately familiar with. One song, Grik Nus (Sun King spelled backwards) is a song that works entirely backwards!     All in all a very creative reworking of the Fab Four we fondly miss so much. And well worth the price of an album, esp at the $8 I paid!

B004132I4S|5.0|I've been a marginal fan of Sufjan Stevens for several years and own most of his albums, but nothing could have prepared me for the groundbreaking, innovative leap the artist has made with this one.  I truly believe that this is *new music*, as in *sounds/styles we've never heard before.*<br /><br />How to describe it? Not sure.  It's electronica, to be sure, but it's also accessible and melodic.  It's a wall of sound textures overlain atop Stevens' sensitive and poignant songwriting.  It's cosmic and spacey, almost like a new genre of progressive rock.  And yet it's also earthbound, mining emotional responses you don't expect.  There are drum machines, orchestral arrangements, angelic choirs, and hooks galore.  \\"Orchestral electronica folk songs\\" is the best way I can describe it.<br /><br />As for the negative reviews posted here, I'm befuddled.  The nay-sayers must not be very adventurous with their musical tastes.<br /><br />I've been listening to the album non-stop for three days now and I'm still blown away.  It's addictive.  It's new.  It's brilliant.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Before this came out on DVD, I spent some time preparing. I read \\"With the Old Breed\\" by E.B. Sledge and did some research on the Pacific theater as well. But due to reviews on this site, I lowered my expectations. Major mistake.    I think the most impressive thing about the series is the restraint it shows. By the end of \\"With the Old Breed\\" I had been completely won over by the gut-wrenching and thorough accounts of Sledge's combat in the Pacific. I was concerned that the series would go too far and portray Sledge as an action hero Bruce-Willis-style. But Hanks and co. have done a near perfect job of portraying the events as they occurred in the book. They seem to recognize that any attempt to make the events \\"more dramatic\\" would would be dishonoring to what those veterans actually went through and that the most heart-breaking story is the true one. As a result episodes 5-7, which all take place on Peleliu, are extremely painful and satisfying at the same time. Of course some license is taken with the events, but these are extremely minor (for ex., even though many of the conversations remain the same, sometimes they are told by different characters) and if the book itself was accurate, than I think the episodes about Sledge must be as well.    Ultimately we will never really know what it was like. But for E.B. Sledge the truth of these events is how they affected him, and the series evokes the same emotional response as the book.    Concerning the rest of the series, I have less of a right to discuss it since I have not read Leckie's book and I know little about Basilone. Suffice it to say, these parts are well done and just as compelling. There seems to be some frustration over certain episodes (like episode 3) and I can understand those complaints (the sexual content exceeds gratuity and is entirely unnecessary for the telling of the story). But overall even these moments portray sides of the war that we rarely think about. The trauma did not stay on the battlefield. The survivors went home to a society that was broken up over their extended absence and amazed at what they had become.    Pick up The Pacific next time you get a chance. It won't let you down.
B003MZ0I84|3.0|Maroon 5 are a singles band. Their albums are okay, but they really have some good singles. The problem with their third album \\"Hands All Over\\" is that it has the same feel all the way through with little variation or variety. Everything is air-brushed and polished, eliminating the possibility of a creative rough edge. Even the different styles the band employs are completely sanded down so that each song bleeds into the next. This means there are no standout tracks and no weak tracks, but every track is nearly identical. You could be on track 9 thinking, \\"Wait, have I actually listened to 9 tracks already?\\"<br /><br />I seriously had difficulty picking songs from this album that I really liked. I downloaded two tracks from the deluxe edition to make my version of \\"Hands All Over\\" 14 tracks. Obviously, \\"Misery\\" was a good first choice as a single and sets the tone for the rest of the album. I think \\"Stutter\\" could be a single, and \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\" could be a third single. I felt \\"Give A Little More\\" was too much a tribute to the sound of Michael Jackson, and the title track is a dead ringer for Def Leppard's \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\". \\"Out Of Goodbyes\\" with Lady Antebellum should have been better than it actually is.<br /><br />I don't know. I was just left with the feeling that Maroon 5 are just an average band with a good lead singer after listening to all three of their albums. They are the equivalent of fast food--you know it's not good for you, but doesn't it taste so good for a minute? I would recommend waiting for a best of or greatest hits compilation because you know it's just around the corner. If this is the band's last album, well they didn't go out with a bang.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Hands All Over\\" compares to the band's previous works:<br /><br />2002 Songs About Jane: Three Stars<br />2007 It Won't Be Soon Before Long: Three and a Half Stars<br />2010 Hands All Over: Three Stars

B003SWNRTI|5.0|In today's world it is extremely difficult to come across a decent classic heavy metal album, let alone a good one. I remember drooling over Ronnie James Dio's Heaven and Hell album \\"The Devil You Know\\" in 2009 because it was the best classic metal album I have heard in a decade at that point, and such a diamond in the rough. After that, I didn't expect to run into anything of similar quality for a long time, but...    Wow. Accept's \\"Blood of the Nations\\" will probably go down as one of the biggest \\"What the hell is that?\\" albums, because it hits you right in the face with amazing heavy metal music from track one to the last track, without letting go for a second. A classic band coming back these days with this kind of incredible material is truly a jewel that many of us will treasure for a very long time.    The melodies, the amazing guitar work (both heavy riffs and insane solos), the aggressive vocals, the clean drumming, no distortion in the production...the talent here is so thick, you can cut it with a knife. I never expected to hear anything of this high quality from any classic band, but boy, was I wrong! This record is addictive and will have you coming back to it again and again. I honestly can't spot any weak points on it and have been listening to it since getting it almost nonstop.    I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone who enjoys such artists as Dio, Iron Maiden, Hammerfall, Firewind, Primal Fear, Black Sabbath, and other similar great bands.

B002GJU54E|4.0|A group of friends & I decided to read this book for October for Halloween (none of us really like horror). I have only read a few of the Stephanie Plum books (and most of those a long time ago), but I was able to jump in with no problems. The book was definitely light on plot, but it was what was I was looking for at the time. I did laugh out loud at times, and the characters are definitely interesting, though sometimes a little predictable. Overall, it was a great, fast read.
0312600844|1.0|Our book club met last night to discuss this book.  Everyone hated it.  The characters were depressing and not believable.  There was no real plot and nothing of interest ever happened. After suffering through over 500 pages, no one could wait for the book to end.  Everyone agreed it was so bad that we cannot put anyone else through the misery and thus cannot donate our books.  We are having a bonfire next month!
B0048Y9TPG|4.0|1. Santa Claus Is Coming to Town (Intro)    This intro really sets the scene for the whole album I love the orchestra and the brass really sets the festive mood and how it blends into Oh Santa! with the sleigh bells is just so festive and the production and instrumental is just on point!    10/10    2. Oh Santa!    Well you can definitely see why it was picked as the lead single the hook is addictive the bass is bombastic and the bells all flow in with Mariah's thick vocals anther middle 8 whistle is just top notch and orgasmic and the roll in to the last chorus is just epic. Ill admit though her belts are a bit scratchy towards the end I dint seem to care because it's such a fun and easy uptempo. Though production wise it is one if the weaker ones on the album.    8/10    3. O Little Town of Bethlehem / Little Drummer Boy    I absolutely adore this Mariah's voice is on point and the whispers and lower register are all so warm and fuzzy. I think the transition between the two and back again is on point and the production is on point all the way through, her vocals are really excellent on this album and the drums are just beautiful with Mariah's whispers and her changing from whispers to belts are just sensational.    10/10    4. Christmas Time Is in the Air Again      This is probably the least overwhelming of the whole album and it Is mostly whispered but it works as it's such a soft delicate song. Amazingly well produced. And really relaxes you and makes you feel happy and at peace.    9/10     5. The First Noel / Born is the King (Interlude)    This is such a beautiful song a personal favourite of mine as it just keeps building and building up to such an amazing climax that touches your soul. Mariah's belting is just beyond impressive and reminiscent of her earlier work. Sadly Born is the King does let it down after such a phenomenal vocal effort it really did leave me feeling disappointed that such a classical Christmas song turned into an underwhelming yet nottoo bad R&B throwback.    7/10    6. When Christmas Comes    Though I was skeptical at first this really is a standout on the album mariah basically belts her ass of from start to finish but showcases her full vocal range. The production is epic and could really see this being a hit on the AC charts definitely.    9/10    7. Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane) /Housetop Celebration     I'm trying to find something positive to say about this song but I just cant. Jermaine shouting his idiot voice off is just unnecessary. Completely disrupts the whole concept and mood of the album. Absolutely ridiculous. The production is awful just abysmal.     3/10      8. Charlie Brown Christmas    This is such an endearing, sweet and innocent track that will connect with so many people all over the world. It was a clever move to put this on the album but it isn't an instant favourite IMO but will be in time.    8/10    9. O Come All Ye Faithful / Hallelujah Chorus (featuring Patricia Carey)    Well their are no words to describe this song it's just phenomenal. My absolute favourite track from the album. Vocally, the song is Mariah's best since 2005 she sings from her soul it's just beautiful. Production wise it's just brilliant I love the piano intro which reminds me of My Saving Grace. The choir just add the awesomeness of this song. Just pure bliss!    10/10    10. O Holy Night    Though I'm not over the moon it's an old track I'm glad it's on the album. It does fit really well and is another standout but for it purely being an old track it doesn't get my total vote unfortunately.    6/10    11. One Child    This song is the definition if a CLASSIC already it could of been easily on the first Christmas album. The vocal arrangement the children's choir everything just blends perfectly to make a perfect soup of Christmas.    10/10    12. All I Want for Christmas Is You (Extra Festive)    The new intro gives me a whole new respect for the song but it doesn't have the punch the original did. But it just had to be on this album didn't it.    8/10    13. Auld Lang Syne (The New Year's Anthem)    I just wanna shake my ass to this song it's so fun and I love it's calm reflective intro and the blend into the celebratory dance chorus just simply genius.     9/10    Total Score= 107/130= 82%= A
B001AQR39O|4.0|My husband and I really loved the first season, lots of dirty humor, really funny. While this season overall is still good, it is definitely not as funny as the first season. being a girl, I am thankful all the naked tits in the first season got covered up, for the most part, in the 2nd season. It was kinda irritating to me how many times Hank's almost wife (can't think of her name) wants to be with him, then break up with him, then be with him, then break up with him, over and over. That does get old. And the ending did irritate me - you're gonna split up, yet again, with the love of your life who you've been trying to get back with together all these years just so your daughter can keep dating her first boyfriend? really?!! that was just a bit much for me. I hope the 3rd season will be back to the former glory of the 1st season.
0393072231|5.0|The often repeated phrase , \\"nobody could have seen this coming\\" is simply untrue and an attempt to rewrite history.  Lewis walks the reader through the dark alleys of Wall Street and international banking where there is far more focus of the generation of profits and bonuses than concern for the investors. It's a world where professional gamblers are betting tens of billions of other people's money on a game that they should know is rigged. However, ego and greed combine to create an institutionalized blindness to the train at the other end of the tunnel.     Lewis follows the creation and growth of a small hedge fund created to exploit the foolishness. Several hundred pages later he details the incredible acts of the US government as it not only saves the Wall Street firms from extermination but makes whole their bad bets at the expense of the American taxpayer. The government stepped in to cover their losses on bad bets without asking for anything of real value for the taxpayers. Worse yet, by rewarding failure the government virtually assured us that a greater failure would follow.       The subjects of the book were certainly not alone, Andrew Lahde (of Andrew's farewell letter to Wall Street fame) has disappeared, probably to some remote island to restore his health. Thankfully Lewis was able to follow the footsteps of others who saw the certain train wreck and were able to overcome the bullying of conventional wisdom. Paulson and others reaped fantastic profits from a market that failed to understand that the trail of corruption and greed that began in the hombuilder's sales office and the giant home loan originators would lead to a worldwide financial crisis that, 4 years later, is not close to being resolved.     The book is a great and easy read. More of an adventure story than an analysis of what happened and what might be done to prevent it from happening again. One of the lasting concerns is that too many of the stupid and greedy people got bailed outby the government to have made any real cultural change.     At a higher level it is a great indictment of corporate management.      There's a very real possibility that as a nation we have suffered permanent damage and the burden of that damage will fall on the shoulders of our children and their children. There's also the possibility that the vast debt created to protect the greedy and incompetent will have put the nation's survival at risk.     Highly recommended.
0545123283|5.0|I am a 32 year old female who is really into the teen romance/fiction stuff like Twilight and Hush, Hush (I totally loved this one!!, as did my husband). I really liked the first book, Shiver, but felt so sad at the end - I had no idea there was a second book. By chance I looked up the author's name at the library and saw she had another book called \\"Linger\\" so I requested it, and felt so thrilled to find out the story in Shiver continued. I'm not the best at giving reviews, but I would recommend this series.  Once again,the ending left me heartbroken. Once I put the book down, I immediately had to google it and found out there is a 3rd book called Forever, which brought tears to my eyes, I'm such a sap. I cannot wait to get the 3rd book, I hope she will end it to my liking.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|There is a slight learning curve with the 405 (basic operations --> setting up workouts), but once you've got that down, this thing is a blast to use.  The touch bezel works fine for me, as does the ANT+ sync (using Vista).  This GPS watch is a great motivational tool for tracking progress.  I'm planning to get the bike accessory for indoor winter roller training.

B0042AEOG0|5.0|Let me first start out by saying this album really showcases the type of artist Mariah Carey is.  Her uncanny ability to write a great song that evokes FEELINGS in the listener to her incomparable vocal stylings...this album represents truly where Mariah Carey is in her career right now.  The \\"grown\\" and \\"mature\\" sound of the album is a good look... Track by track review!   1.  \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\" - This is a full out orchestra instrumental, u can practically SEE the snow falling, ur breathe in the air and smell the Evergreens! It sets the tone for the rest of album's sound musically.  2.  \\"Oh Santa\\" - We all know this! Now when I first heard it I cannot lie, I was a little disappointed with the vocals and busy production.  But after repeated listens the production adds to the hype of the song and overall feeling! The song is more about production and melody than a big vocal performance! The melody is infectious and will be stuck in head after just one listen.  As for the vocals, she sang in her nasal full voice with a piercing and creative high note at the end.  The background vocalist really shine on here as well.    3.  \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" / \\"Little Drummer Boy - Slow at pace, but heavy in emotion and feeling.  Mariah takes her time while singing this, and indulges in melisma (the singing style she used most during Daydream, Butterfly and Rainbow era) only to build up to a great climax of vocals.  She is just SAAANGIN...what makes these two tracks fresh is Mariah's new arrangement.  The \\"rum pum pum pum\\"s are so creative and so Mariah and its her vocal interpretation that make it so fresh and new! I love how she says \\"PROCLAAAIM!\\" at the climax of the song! It's a Mariah'ism only the lambs will understand lol.   4.  \\"Christmas Time Is In The Air Again\\" - This is my FAVORITE track.  All the lyrics were written by Mariah alone.  It sounds like a 1940s Bing Crosby standard and just exudes the feeling of Christmas, especially in lyrics and production.  She sings in a mature whisper/raspy register throughout which makes it seem like she's singing in your ear.  This is the type of song you listen to with a nice hot cup of cocoa, wrapped up tight by the fire, watching the snow fall down with family.  Its just BEAUTIFUL! The orchestra was a perfect touch.  Her voice sounds very strong here, however, her falsetto is airy (but it works).    5.  \\"The First Noel\\" / \\"Born is the King\\" (Interlude)- The First Noel she starts over very subduded and is just straight-out singing, stretching the word NOEL only the way Mariah Carey can, leading up to an unleashing of her full, smooth, clear belts.  The best belts since MIMI era! Next is Born Is The King, which serves as a great Butterfly esque track.  Its has HARD THUMPING BEAT, sensual production, yes sensual and an addictive refrain of the title while Mariah's coos religious lyrics in the background! Its simply sublime, a surprise and a fan favorite!  I was not expecting it but its the kind of track that makes you stop everything you're doing and listen closely.    6.  \\"When Christmas Comes\\" - Second favorite song of CD and also the 3rd of 4 original compositions by Mariah Carey.  This sounds like vocally and musically it could be an outtake from the MIMI era which is great news, because her voice is on!  She sings this completely in FULL VOICE, which is a nice departure from her most recent vocal stylings.  The vocals are like STAY THE NIGHT, big and loud throughout the whole song.  WCC gives a \\"This Christmas\\" by D. Hathaway vibe, its an ole school, 70s, soul Christmas classic in the making!  The highnote at the end is identical to the one in Oh Santa.  It really makes you wanna just curl up and spend the holidays with that special someone. Best vocal thus far..   7.  \\"Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)\\" / \\"Housetop Celebration\\" - Second track produced by Mariah, JD and Brian Michael Cox (We Belong Together) and its an urban, house party, throwback jam..with a 90s feel.  At first listen I was turned off by the layered vocals and busy sounding production (same first thought with Oh Santa) but after repeated listens you began to appreciate tho two Mariah voices on the verses, similar to Melt Away, with one Mariah singing the low reg and the other singing high.  I prefer single vocal tracks, but whatever.  The song will def get the party started and the gift giving going lol.  I LOVE the jazzy 'santa claus is comin to town' sung in a monotone low register at the end repeated.   8.  \\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\" - Beautiful slice of childhood.  Very nostalgic.  The slowest song on album after the Charlie Brown festive intro and song almost completely in a raspy whisper.  Gorgeous.    9.  \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\" / \\"Hallelujah Chorus\\" (featuring Patricia Carey)\\" - Can we just have a moment of silence to appreciate the masterpiece that IS this track.  It begins with Mariah's whisper register (she uses it throughout this album but to her advantage, not as a distraction or an attempt to NOT sing like many accused Charmbracelet of) on first verse and a full voice chorus with backing choir.  Then comes Mrs. Patricia's AMAZING OPERATIC SOLO! Her voice is the reason Mariah sounds the way she does.  Mrs. Pat is a talented, skilled vocalist, her voice reminds of Susan Boyles (that's a compliment!) in its fullness, tone, and enunciation! Simply SUPERB!  I have to be honest, when I first heard the song I was more IMPRESSED by it than anything else, meaning someone people may think its just a show off song and Mariah neglected any emotion but that's NOT true!  You definitely FEEL.    10.  O Holy Night (Live) - This is the live version recorded in 2000, there is also a music video (filmed in 2000) that goes with it.  I'm glad it was included because it's an EPIC live rendition that needs to be on record.   The main difference between this and the 1994 version is her style of singing.  In 2000 she was still very full voiced with a lotof power but she started to explore her whisper register a lot more and a dynamic of melismatic changes throughout the verses instead of just singing the words straight out.  Its  very pretty and truly what sets Mariah apart from her peers and why the way she sings her songs are uncover able.   Those in love with her high notes and famous range will find plenty of upper register trills in this, especially throughout the climax! She really takes it to church on this one!  This has a live feel with background clapping, audience noise and praise.  Melonie Daniels and Maryann Tatum are the only ones on backup besides choir.  The only draw back about this track being on the album is that it brings to the forefront the changes (her voice does change with every album, except 1990-1994) in her voice over the last 10 years...still a STAND OUT!   11.  One Child - This retelling of the story of Christ was written by Mariah Carey and Marc Shaiman.  Mariah did the lyrics by herself and majority of melody.  This song is sung in a full voiced tone throughout building to a belting extravaganza of a climax!  Mariah goes off and her voice just soars up into the rafters.  The back up singers provide great support and add that gospel feel that most of the album exudes.  The child chorus is reminiscent of a Michael Jackson type track, but Mariah's vocals still are at the forefront throughout.  Her belts are loud, full, clear and powerful and not scratchy or the least bit raspy.  Vocals are very pure and DO NOT SOUND DIGITALLY ENHANCED.  It is much in the style of her earlier singing.  She ends the song in a melimatic falsetto that dips into her lower chocolate smooth tones.    12.  All I Want For Christmas Is You (Extra Festive) - The Disney-like/Broadway intro is pure magic and fully embodies Christmas.  The is a completely re-done vocal that sounds pretty identical to the original.. Mariah adds a few extra ad libs and fully completes the song..Whereas the original version would fadeout just when Mariah got to the outro ad libs...this one does not.  The chorus is beefed up with Melonie and Maryann's vocals and the song overall has a much HARDER bass line that bangs with the right speakers!  Mariah's vocal is of 2010, but she sings it in the same style as 1994 and you can hardly tell the difference, but at the same time you can.  Her belts are powerful and clear and makes you wish she sang more songs this full out and with this much energy!  This song still has the excitement as the OG version but is indeed extra festive!  I love the end \\"All I want..all I really want all I really want...\\" to the end--- she only did that once in 1998 Butterfly tour performance!  It was a great idea to add this new recorded version to the album for those that can't decide which to buy..   13.  Auld Lang Syne - The song has a loud, full voice, belted intro which showcases what we fell in love with 20 years ago.  THE VOICE!  The song then segues into an electro dance number full of boisterous background vocals, thumping base line, repetivie chorus, and funky ad libs by the Diva!  Rihanna and Kesha better count their lucky stars Mariah doesn't put out a full on dance album and crush them! Lol.  But seriously it's a great way to end the album and end the year.  Plus the background vocals feature Melonie very heavily..her voice is indescribable as well!  The high note at the end is loud and pure, her voice was a great vocal form.      5 STARS   *Did this on a lunch break, please excuse typos.  Its just if I didn't do this NOW i would never find the time*
B001FB4W0W|4.0|My husband and I watched the whole first season during a weekend. I was intrigued by the first episode, but then I did start to lose some interest. I pretty much only care about the story line involving Sookie and Bill, although it is a bit irritating how she will be into him, then get pissed off at him, then see eachother and make passionate love, then break up again, over and over. I really don't care at all about the rest of the characters in the show. I don't care for Tara and her attitude. I think the affects of \\"V\\" is just a bit too corny. The relationships around Tara and Jason Stackhouse take away from the show, in my opinion. Overall, it's just an okay show. I am curious to watch more about Bill and Sookie though, but I'm into the romance stuff. My husband, however, likes the show more than me and cannot wait to see the second season. He thinks it's really fun. Had I seen True Blood before watching the first 2 seasons of Californication, I might have liked it better. But I kept thinking \\"Californication is better\\"
0525951652|4.0|The book is terrific but it came damaged.  Approximately 30 pages were not pre-cut and I had to cut them with a razor blade.  These 30 pages are not the same size and even a sharp razor blade could not make them look okay.  Very unsatisfied with the quality of the material.
B003TML0VO|4.0|Fellow music lovers you guys got it wrong hes paying homage to OTHER artists greats not his OWN. He is paying homage to them in his own interpretation. The album is great. Some of these songs are from these artists early sets when they SET the standard. He is just re- introducing them to new listeners and to old farts like US bringin back some good times. It reminds me of concert sets where you get light and just jam. I was wondering just from reading some of the critiques if any of you jokers listened to his Moonflower or Festival Albums, now there are TWO GREAT ALBUMS. Be kool and safe
B000062X90|5.0|I won't add anything about Argus...enough has been said here. Just encouraging anyone looking at this page to check out WBA's other albums too! They're all good, not all similar, but all great, even the newer ones from the past 10 years or so. If you're not into this band, you should be!
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Hitchcock is the master and, in high definition, his work shines evemore. Great edition to any collection with incredible restored picture.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I like this show so much and this dvd is great. But, the information about this product is incomplete at box and in website. There's subtitled in brazilian portuguese and other languages.
0618918248|5.0|This book is, without a doubt, the best I have read on the subject of the existence of God.    From the very start, Dawkins is direct about his intentions.  He starts off explaining pantheism and Einsteinian Religion, so as to address any confusion that may arise.   One of the more interesting parts of the book, however, is the fact that he doesn't hold to the position that \\"the two magisterium [of science and religion] do not overlap\\" (qtd. Dawkins 55), but rather examines the question of the existence of god as a scientific question.  Later in the book, he rips apart the arguments for the existence of god, explains why his existence is so improbable (in the chapter, \\"Why There is Almost Certainly No God\\"), accounts for the origin of both religion and morality, and finally examines just what is so wrong with religion, and why liberation from it is necessary.  Mr. Dawkins then ends the book on a very positive, optimistic note on the progress of humanity.    If ever I could rate a book above 5 stars, I would rate this one.  When I picked up the book, I was on the fence about the existance of god; I had seen a few interviews of Richard Dawkins, and he always presented a great case for his views.  I got this book to see what exactly made him so sure that he was right, and this book did not disappoint.  In this work, Dawkins makes a strong case, both against theism, and against organized religion in general.  If you are at all interested in this subject, I highly recommend that you buy this book; if you don't think that you're interested, I still recommend that you buy it, since after reading this book, you will be.
B0007GADZO|4.0|In response to the the negative and some positive reviews here I have to say most of you have no idea what you are talking about and are not qualfied to judge this recording. You may have an opinion but based on what?    I'll take one song off this recording and explain what I mean.    K'm-Pee-Du-Wee is a blues tune.  The I chord is held for 8 measures instead of the usual 4. Then the IV chord is held for 4 measures instead of the usual 2. The remainder follows the traditional way for the most part.    This is not a new idea but one that Vai uses to great interest. He is not taking a blues approach and he is certainly not a jazzer using loads of chord substitutions as well. His is more modal and that is his forte.    He tansforms a blues progression into something else altogether with unique tone, chops and humour.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|This is a well done 3D disc. The video quality is fantastic. Discs like this should be included with every 3D tv to showcase the new technology and potential of it. If you own a 3d tv this is a great disc to showcase your tv to friends , its not too long , the video quality is great.
1439181780|5.0|This book is a riveting, yet an easy, enjoyable read.  It is no-nonsense and not loaded down with fluff.  I particularly enjoyed the abundant, extremely diverse and relevant quotations found throughout. You can't read this book without having it make you think and act and thereby change your perceptions and life for the better.  The timeless concepts are artfully presented to capture the attention of twenty-first century readers.
B0049VZ2UY|4.0|The show so far is good but the main guy is pissing me off. I have a hard time believing he is a cop being as how slow he is to react to everything! He also seems to forget that there are millions of dead people walking around when he goes up to a house and asks for some gas like someone would just be sitting on the porch having some lemon aid!
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|'Death at a Funeral' is one of the funniest movies ever made.  Be forewarned; if you start passing out if you cannot stop laughing, this film is NOT for you!<br /><br />The plot has been covered elsewhere here (over 200 reviews as of this date), so I'll concentrate on the acting and the writing.  This is a fully realized, totally overwhelming writing effort.  The movie is uniformly hilarious.  The plot ideas may be a bit far-fetched (hallucinatory drugs???) but the plot isn't the main thing here.  It does get from point A to point B in without falling apart, but it's the journey that's the unbelievably funny part.<br /><br />The acting?  I can see how it might be difficult for the excellent cast to keep it under control while going through this thoroughly side-splitting film.  It's got to be played deadpan, and the actors maintain control during the shenanigans.<br /><br />I can't praise this film high enough.  I've not seen the American remake (why they have to remake a movie in English and in familiar settings is beyond me), but I KNOW it can't be funnier than the original.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy or rent this film today.  Don't watch it while eating, unless the thought of meatloaf going through your nasal passages is something you look forward to.  Highly, highly recommended!  Five plus stars for 'Death at a Funeral'.  One of the funniest films ever made.  A must see!
B001IHJ97E|5.0|Finally, a remastering of this, Natalie Wood's last film, presented in the original theatrical aspect ratio as it was exibhited in the movie theaters.  Many would not agree with me but the previous version changed the film to only the widescreen version so the scenes in which you were supposed to be experiencing the device in the film were the same aspect ratio as the rest of the film.  I believe you lost the intended effect of those scenes upon the studio doing that on the previous version of the film's release on DVD.    I have the Laser Video Disc version which is the same at this \\"new, remastered\\" version, which is presented as it was in theaters.    I am very pleased with this version and they spent a little time cleaning up the print too.    I highly recommend this version for those who want the film as it was originally presented.
B00406UK5A|4.0|This was actually a pretty good movie. I wanted to rent it first but all the copies were out so I took a chance and just bought it. I kind of expected that I'd regret spending the money on it but within the first fifteen minutes I was convinced I'd made the right decision. It's too bad I didn't see this movie in the theaters, although I don't recall it ever even going to the theaters. If it was a direct to dvd release then that's truly a shame it would have looked very cool on the big screen.
B000063UR1|5.0|\\"The Ecology\\" was a very serious issue in the 1970s and we seem to be back to again now.  This film presents what happens when the earth becomes so polluted and over populated that forests are preserved by sending them into space until things can be changed and they can be returned to where they belong.<br /><br />The unfortunate result is it doesn't happen that way and the order is given to destroy the forests as they will not be returning to earth after many years of preservation in space.  A conservationist, played by Bruce Dern, decides to take matters into his own hands.<br /><br />This film is a combination of Science Fiction coupled with \\"The Ecology\\" issue and they were even able to get Joan Baez to perform some of the music for the film.<br /><br />This is a great film and a must have for collectors of Sci-Fi!
0316113506|5.0|If your goal is to live a long and healthy life, then read this book!!  You have the power to change your brain!  Put on your running shoes and see what happens!!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I had been hearing the buzz about this movie long before ever seeing a preview.  I already knew that this would be the best action movie ever made, if for no other reason, just because of the actor lineup and the fact that Sylvester Stallone was heading up the cast!  Then I saw the first preview, and I KNEW that this movie was going to be awesome!  Sure, the movie critics are going to cut a movie like this down, but usually, if they don't like it, that means that I am going to love it!  Sure enough, once again, that proved to be true!  This will be the action movie to beat for a long, long time!  All I can say is ... BRING IT ON WITH A FOLLOW UP!  :-)
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|I am a very big fan of Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott.  This semi historical portrayal of Robin Hood is a great work. Many feel the violence is too much and I know that violence is a problem - however this is set in a very turbulent period in the history of England and it speaks at great lengths to which the characters chose to bring that turbulence to the screen.<br />Being in my 60's I have seen a lot of Robin Hood movies.  Many were really poor quality, some were average, a few were actually good.  This is by far the best one yet.<br />I highly recommend this as a real masterpiece.  Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchet are superb together.
B000O3U4NG|5.0|Wonderful used LP! Was in great shape just like it was noted. Lightning fast shipping. Would purchase from again. Highly recommended! Thanks guys.<br /><br />After listening, the LP was found to have one skip in it. So, a little disappointed, but as overall experience, it was good.
B0048ZJOP0|5.0|This album is great for old and new fans of Mariah. It's got everything from traditional standards to originals that Mariah co-wrote. Plus, she still has an amazing voice. :) You can dance to some of the songs on here like \\"Oh Santa\\" and \\"Auld Lang Syne.\\" Strongly recommend!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Was very pleased with my purchased. The movie seemed like it was new and not even used.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I enjoyed this film very much, for Meryl Streep as Julia Child and the insight into the real Julia - her life in France, her marraige, her co-authors and the years of work that went into her first book; well worth watching and learning.<br />On the other hand, while the young 'Julie' (Amy Adams) is funny at times, she is mostly annoying, whiny, and her segments were not as good as those of Julia.<br /><br />Meryl shines!  As Julia, she's well worth watching, especially if you love Julia Child and anything French.<br /><br />So, break out the good FRENCH wine, velvet pillows, get comfy and savor.<br /><br />Bon Appetit!
0316234753|5.0|I found this book for my daughter & was ECSTATIC!!!!!  This is the EXACT same book I had when I was a kid in the 70's.  It was an awesome book to learn how to draw characters.  It takes the fear & \\"scariness\\" out of drawing.  It has a nice, easy step by step approach showing simple things like a filled in letter D or draw a straight line or a dot.  So easy for anyone to learn.  I am looking at another book for my daughter for christmas.
B00005N6KG|2.0|When I bought these, i was going for a running's security headset.  These, although they didn't pop out easily from just listening and reading or writing or even while on the bike, these had no chance of staying in my small ears while running.  I like headphones that go into my ear vs. just sit on the little \\"nook\\" of my ear-hole.  These did not accomplish this.  If you are a runner or intense movement exerciser, these aren't for you.  Otherwise, they are great.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|This is a great effort CD release by the Nashville alternative rockers, Kings Of Leon, titled \\"Come Around Sundown\\". The first 2 opening tracks, \\"The End\\" & \\"Radioactive\\" are just okay hard rock songs. Third track, \\"Pyro\\" is a better track with a great rhythm guitar entrance, it's a bit laid-back track as compared to the first 2 tracks & has great vocals. \\"Mary\\" is a great track with great melody & harmonies. The next 2 tracks, \\"The Face\\" (varied melody song)  & \\"The Immortals\\" (punky song) are just okay songs. \\"Back Down South\\" is a solid track/gem with great guitar entrance interlaced with a beautiful violin. It's a laid-back track with great vocals & harmonies. The next 2 tracks, \\"Beach Side\\" & \\"No Money\\" are rather weak tracks from this great CD. \\"Pony Up\\" is an okay track with great lead guitar. \\"Birthday\\" is a great laid-back track with great lead guitar & wonderful melody. \\"Mi Amigo\\" is another great laid-back track with great vocal, great lead guitar & melody. The closing track, \\"Pickup Truck\\" is a solid track/gem with great bass entrance & rhythm guitar, great high pitched vocals & great melody. This is my favourite track from this CD. On overall, this is a great effort by Kings Of Leon, a well deserved 4 stars by this great alternative rock band. A highly recommended listening.
0525951652|4.0|I am enjoying this book although it is far from flawless. The lead up to WWI is overdone, and I'm someone who taught this period of history for many years and a big fan of historical novels. If it started to drag for me, it seems that the drawn out descriptions of diplomacy and alliances - which did in fact lead to the war - would be pretty deadly for a reader without enormous interest in small details. The 'soap opera' sections are quite compelling, though some of the sexual details are a little off-putting. I do like that Follett stays with his characters in long enough sequences; John Jakes is an historical writer that I've been re-reading lately, and he jumps between his characters so often as to be annoying. However, I think that Jakes is much more skilled in weaving his historical detail into the stories of his characters. I will finish this book happily, and I'm sure I'll read the next two when they come along.
B00284BMBM|4.0|This is a great effort CD release by Chris Daughtry & his band, the album is titled \\"Leave This Town\\". This great CD has 12 tracks, reviewed as follows : \\"You Don't Belong\\" is a great opening track, heavy guitars with amazing vocals. The next 2 tracks, \\"No Surprise\\" & \\"Everytime You Turn Around\\" are just okay songs. \\"Life After You\\" is a great laid-back track with a beautiful lead guitar. \\"What I Meant To Say\\" is another just okay track. \\"Open Your Eyes\\" is a great track with great rhythm guitar. \\"September\\" is a solid track/gem, laid-back song with great acoustic guitar & great vocals. This is my favourite track from this great CD. \\"Ghost Of Me\\" is just an  okay song. \\"Learn My Lesson\\" is another solid track/gem, laid-back track with great guitar & harmonies. \\"Supernatural\\" is a great track with great vocals. \\"Tennesse Line\\" is a solid track/gem, is a laid-back song with great rhythm guitar, great harmonies & vocals. The closing track, \\"Call Your Name\\" has great rhythm guitar entrance, as well as great acoustic guitar & great vocals. This is Daughtry's second CD, they certainly shouldn't 'Leave This Town'! On overall this is a great effort by Daughtry in this second CD offering/release by this great rock band, a highly recommended listening.
0440539811|5.0|One of my most favorite books. Ever. Really, enough said. It is also one of the most mind-bending and sometimes even mind-blowing books.
B003WO4UIE|5.0|This is a great introduction to the legendary Canadian rock singer-songwriter Bryan Adams's 30 years musical hits in a CD aptly titled, \\"Icon\\" (from Icon series releases). It has 12 great solid classics/hits that are a good representation of (introduction to) his great musical career from 1980 to 2010. This CD, \\"Icon\\" was released on 8/31/10, has however no track representation from the following CD releases, \\"You Want It, You Got It\\" (1981), \\"Into The Fire\\" (1987), \\"Room Service\\" (2005) & \\"11\\" (2008). He is also releasing a CD live compilation (20 tracks) titled \\"Bare Bones\\" on 11/16/10 & CD Deluxe Edition (also 20 tracks in a deluxe package/digipak for Bryan Adams's greatest fans) \\"Bare Bones\\" on 11/30/10 both of which have also new tracks in addition to his previous hits, recorded live during the \\"Bare Bones Live Tour\\" with just acoustic guitar & piano in most songs. The 12 tracks on \\"Icon\\" are reviewed as follows, \\"Summer Of '69\\" (a solid memorable track on his humble beginning in his musical career, great guitar string pickings/notes & vocals), \\"Heaven\\" (a solid rock ballad), \\"Run To You\\" (solid hard rock track, together with \\"Somebody\\", are a good representation of his 'earlier sound') [these 3 solid tracks are from the wonderful 1984 CD release, \\"Reckless\\"]. \\"Cuts Like A Knife\\" (a great solid melodic rock track with great vocals & harmonies), \\"Straight From The Heart\\" (another solid 'laid-back' rock track with amazing high pitched vocals by Bryan Adams) [these 2 track are the 1983 CD release, \\"Cuts Like A Knife\\"]. \\"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\\" (a great rock track, had a great video 'in the days') & \\"Everything I Do (I Do It For You)\\" (a blockbuster track for the movie, \\"Robin Hood : Prince Of Thieves\\", from this amazing track onwards, Bryan Adams 'earned' the unofficial  title of 'king of ballads' [these 2 tracks are from the bestseller CD, \\"Waking Up The Neighbours (1991)]. \\"Here I Am\\" (a great track from soundtrack/movie, \\"Spirit\\", released in 2002. \\"Cloud 9\\" is great melodic pop/rock song from the CD, \\"On A Day Like Today\\", released in 1998. \\"Have You Ever Really Loved A Women\\" (a solid ballad track/love song, ballads can't get better than this, amazing!) &  \\"The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You\\" (a great melodic pop/rock track) [these 2 track are from the very successful CD release, \\"18 Til I Die\\" (1996)]. On overall this is an excellent compilation (but certainly not exhaustive). This compilation, \\"Icon\\" is a great representation/introduction to Bryan Adams's great musical career hits, a highly recommended listening.
B003YUC2FE|1.0|I don't typically write reviews, unless I am either overly thrilled with the purchase, or greatly disappointed.  Unfortunately, this case is the latter.    The packaging is an absolute injustice for a trilogy of this caliber.  Given the quality of all three movies and their popularity, I expected the royal treatment with this box set.  What we get instead is cheap black foam that I can already see is leaving a fine residue on the discs as I remove/insert the discs.  It is difficult to find the disc that you want to see, since the discs are packaged close together in line -- In order to find a particular disc, you need to remove several until you find the one you want.  Also, there is no way to take the discs out or reinsert them without feeling like you will eventually damage them.     My recommendation -- spend the extra $10 and buy the movies individually. I wish I had.

B000QXDED6|5.0|The much talked about criticisms of this movie have some basis. The Spartans attire is laughable, the monsters and beasts fighting for the Persians are ridiculous, the special effects (especially the animated blood and sepia lens) take away from the illusion of reality, and many historical inaccuracies can by annoying to those who know them. That being said this is still my favorite all time movie and possibly for only one reason, the first combat scene when the Spartans absorb the disorganized Persian charge, halt it and then systematically push forward slaughtering the entire force. This is the best history in the movie.<br /><br />The significance of highly disciplined heavy infantry of free Greeks fighting for their homeland against lightly armored conscripts from various eastern nations under imperial order. That is probably about how it looked. The names and Greek terms like Agoge, Carnia, Ephors and any I am blanking on are all correctly used, with regard that the Ephors in this movie are as poorly dipicted as the character of Ephialtes. I can understand litterally every artistic freedom taken with the movie, not that I approve of many of them at all, but I see historical basis for many of them and typical cinematic drama for the others.<br /><br />I'm not going to write one of those 10,000 word reviews to defend every point, but I have read more about the Spartans and the Persian Wars than any other military subject, and this is my favorite movie and yet I know that could have been several times greater because the actual history is that much more impressive. Lastly, the idea of racism in this movie is laughable. I remember and in fact still have the newspaper clipping of the country of Iran (modern Persians) expressing their anger over this films \\"complete historical inaccuracy\\". Aside from those inaccuracies I have already confessed the actual storyline is as historical as can be. King Xerxes, who was without a doubt a megalomaniac (he had the waters at the pass of the Dardanelles whipped for not cooperating with his plans), and led what is likely the largest army every assembled until the 20th century to march on indepednant Greece. And there at the Hot Gates by the Hot Springs (Thermoylae) 7,000 Greek allies, led by King Leonidas and 300 elite Spartans (arguably the best of the greatest fighters in the world) held the narrow pass for three days so the rest of the Greeks could get their act together. Other than two Spartans who had been sent back to Sparta the rest stayed and died fighting in a much better scene than the movie showed. I would argue that had their position in the pass not been betrayed by a local herdsman (Ephialtes), those 7,000 would have held the entire Persian army in check for as long as they tried to enter by the northern route into Greece.Dardanelles whipped for not cooperating with his plans), and led what is likely the largest army every assembled until the 20th century to march on indepednant Greece.

B0042KA58G|5.0|I purchased an Itunes season pass for Vampire Diaries Season 2 and couldn't be more sorry. I paid $50 and yet I have to wait a full 2 days after the episodes air before Itunes will send them to me.<br /><br />Yet they are available on Amazon.com the very next day after they air!! So, I've been so frustrated I've ended up purchasing them at Amazon and couldn't be happier with Amazon - except thanks to Itunes lousy customer service, I can't get a refund and I have to pay twice for this season!<br /><br />It's a no brainer - if Amazon has access the very next day to the episode, so does Itunes but Itunes doesn't care about customer service; Amazon does.<br /><br />To top it off CT TV airs the episodes for free on their website 2 days or so later, so why did I pay Itunes $50 if I have to wait the same amount of time and I could watch it for free? Because I didn't do my homework.<br /><br />Amazon gives you a season pass, you only wait til the next day, and no commercials.<br /><br />Itunes makes you wait two days for something you could watch for free with only 4 commercials.<br /><br />I'll never buy anything from ITUNES again - Amazon has my loyalty now.<br /><br />Great series by the way - lots of cliffhangers that makes waiting an extra two days for Itunes a raw deal.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The Forgotten Garden has a permanent place on my all time favorite book list! I was drawn in and swept away in this heartfelt mystery. I didn't want it to end. An epic tale with believable characters caught in acts of hope and desperation. This book will be anything but forgotten. A tremendous read.
0439023491|4.0|I find I get more done if I listen to stories while I work. Certain authors are best heard rather than read. While I don't have a comparison because I have not read Suzanne Collins, I have heard Hunger Games and Catching Fire on audio cd now and enjoyed both.<br /><br />Summary - with mild spoiler that's not really a spoiler if you've read enough YA stuff: Katniss Everdeen gets sucked back into the Hunger Games and becomes an unwitting pawn in a much larger game.<br /><br />Some people rail against the similarity to the first book and to some extent I agree that much of it is the same. (Enter games, kill or be killed...) Also, that bit about the president's visit struck me as a bit lazy as it was basically an information dumping session for the author to remind people where the plot stood at the end of the first book. That said, the clock bit in the games was a neat twist.<br /><br />Are these stories predictable? Sure. I knew the last line of the book way before it was uttered by the narrator.<br /><br />Do the stories have some flaws? Sure, the characters get a little whiny, there's not much realistic drama to the love triangle, etc.<br /><br />Are the books still enjoyable? Definitely.<br /><br />Is there a possibility of deeper discussion for things like literature classes? Sure, you can take this book and the first one as lightly or heavily as you like. There's some great fodder for dystopia discussions, probably even a way to tie it to history lessons.
B003K025V4|5.0|Of course many people are going to judge and write a review without simply listening to each song. This has to be her best album yet. I think everyone judges the album due to the cover, which is stunning. Her music is a lot more mature, but still appropriate for all ages. This is definitely a huge and great step away from Hannah Montana, showing the world she is a true artist.
B0021L8V1G|5.0|great action movie. The first movie of course is better, but I gave it 5 stars because of Mickey Rourke and his come back acting in this movie and others he has done
B00406UK7S|5.0|Fantastic movie! Love the set-up... Romans vs Picts. Great action adventure movie. This one's up there with \\"Agora\\" as my favorite movie of the year. Don't buy many dvds anymore, but this one's a keeper. If you liked \\"Dog Soldiers\\" or \\"The Descent\\", you'll love this one. It's Mr. Marshall's best movie yet! Don't mind the other reviews that are middling to negative. This movie is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. Brisk pacing, fantastic fight scenes, great acting, sexy men, one beautiful woman, one evil woman and lovely landscapes, beautifully filmed. What more can a guy want in a escapist movie? Fully satisfied here.
B002ZG98XW|5.0|A classic as soon as it hit the theaters...one of THE BEST movies of all time!
B0004Z33EG|5.0|The script for \\"First Blood\\" was floating around Hollywood for some time before director Ted Kotcheff signed on to direct the film and Stallone signed on to star in and do the screenplay. Part of what makes \\"First Blood\\" so great is the political realness of it. The way that Rambo was treated is the way a lot of other Vietnam vets were treated when they returned home.    \\"First Blood\\" is about Vietnam vet John Rambo. The film starts out were we see Rambo walking down a road, to find Delmare Berry. He is the last living member of the team that he served together on in Vietnam. Rambo learns that Delmare was killed by agent orange cancer. Having no where else to go, Rambo wonders into a small town called Hope. The Sheriff named Teasle stops him and offers him a ride to the edge of town. Teasle tells Rambo he does not want drifters in his town. Teasle drops Rambo off at the South end of Town and while he drives away, he sees Rambo walking back into Town. This causes Rambo to get arrested. While in the police station, Rambo has flashbacks to his torture in Vietnam which causes him to escape. With the help of Rambo's Colonel from Vietnam, Teasle is on the hunt for Rambo.    The acting in \\"First Blood\\" is Oscar worthy. Sylvester Stallone playing John Rambo, does a wonderful job. There is not a whole lot of dialogue for Stallone in this film, but he makes it work. Also, with his breakdown at the end, which is incredible goes a long way and is personally relatable to Vietnam veterans.  Also, Brian Dennehy who plays Sheriff Teasle, does a great job. His character is an overweight, but tough cop. He never gives up on the search for Rambo, even when the higher authorities come in.  The character  Colonel Sam Trautman played by Richard Crenna is a noteworthy performance. Trautman is not directly involved in the search for Rambo, however since Rambo has no family or friends, Trautman is the only person he can trust.    Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for his \\"Rambo\\"and \\"Rocky\\" films. However, \\"First Blood\\" is Stallone's best individual film.  Finally, \\"First Blood\\" is not solely an action film, it is a mix between action and drama.
0525951652|4.0|This is a good read.  Ms. Lins review may have over-rated (5 stars)the book in the context of the pantheon of great novels, but she is closer than the \\"average\\" review (2 1/2 stars).<br /><br />Follett is a natural story teller.  This is a gift.  It can't be learned.  It has nothing to do with being an expert grammarian, having a mind-busting vocabulary, or a style of short declarative sentences.  There are many authors that have great plot ideas and interesting characters, yet do not capture the readers' love for the story.  Michael Crichton comes to mind.  That kind of author may have the accuracy of a photograph--a true picture--but lack the empathy for the depicted reality.<br /><br />Follett's description of the delivery of casualty/death notices to a small welsh community, following the bloody<br /> WWI battle of the Somme, brought tears to my eyes.  The characters were fictional, but the incident was \\"real\\".  How many young men continue to be wasted in ill conceived conflicts even onto today?<br /><br />My major was modern European history.  The story development, including Wales, England, Germany, Russia, and the U.S., all seems quite accurate from my perspective.  What Follett adds is a feeling of what it was like to live at that time.  His Welsh heritage puts an authenticity to descriptions of coal mining in Wales, the vernacular of the working class, the conflict of labor vs management, and the aristocracy that owned the lands and harvested its wealth for the benefit of a narrow segment of society.  Yes, indeed he is a natural story teller.
B003UESJJC|4.0|Coppola's film commentary just in itself makes this 3 disc set well worth the cost. The original version remains my prefered favorite version especially in Blue Ray. I'm not a big fan of change so the redux version takes a backseat.    Kenneth Haft  Glen Allen

B003XKAZKO|4.0|Maybe we're missing the point. When I found out there was going to be a reissue of Bona Drag, I lept on it and preordered.  I spent the next month dreaming about bonus tracks, new cover/sleeve art, and fabulous photos.  I had such lofty expectations, anything would have been a letdown.<br /><br />I would call the packaging simple and minimal.  I actually like the changed cover photo; it's striking where the original was flashy.  The additional photos left me feeling as grey as the spectrum they display.<br /><br />As for the remastering, the sound is better; richer and fuller than before.  The arrangement has somewhat of a cut-and-paste feel, but I can appreciate what's been done.  Compare a theater-released film vs. the inevitable \\"director's cut\\".  While the original will always have a place in your heart, the new versions find their way into your mind.<br /><br />The bonus tracks?  Well, you could add a rendition of \\"itsy-bitsy spider\\" that he sings in the shower and I would be enthralled, so there's no way I could pretend to be impartial.  However, unless you feel the same way, you may be better off finding these songs elsewhere.<br /><br />And maybe THAT'S the point here.  We expect so much, and accept so little.  As I understand it, he's still without a major label, right?  Had this been from SONY, the outcome would be different I'm sure.<br /><br />So don't be too quick to judge based on his relatively safe endeavor with a smaller production company.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I initially bought this as a welcome back home gift for the hubby.  I have never heard of this show before, but it looked manly like 300 and Gladiator.  My hubby wasn't going to be home for a few more weeks and curiousity got to me...4 episodes later...I thought this is the best show I have ever seen.  Aside from the fact that the quality is as great as some of the movies out there. It's like 300/Gladiator/Spartacus(original movie)/ and Sin City all rolled into one.  I can't believe not more people have seen this show.  4 of my co-workers took turns borrowing it from me, and they felt the same way.  \\"Bass@$$\\" was more their description, but almost all our male friends love this show.  If you're a female trying to find a good gift for your significant other....THIS IS IT...assuming they haven't seen it yet. And for the Blu Ray price of (I got it for $34.99 Amazon at the time), you just can't beat it.  It looks UUHHMAZING in Blu Ray!!!!<br /><br />  The only thing is, yes it is VERY graphic, and have LOTS of nudity so NEVER watch it around the kids (it also has some homosexual intonations)...as in NEVER. It is the most graphic/violent/most nudity I have ever seen in a show or any movie (sorry, I do not watch porno).  But the acting and the story line along with the cinematography is just outstanding.  Nothing will top this show for a very, very long time.  Just sad that Andy Whitfield is not returning.  OF COURSE, I am a Crixus fan like every girl I know  :-P
0525951652|5.0|When Ken Follett was asked why he chose to write FALL OF GIANTS, the first novel in his planned CENTURY trilogy, the intersecting history of five families beginning in the early years of the twentieth century, he responded:<br /><br />\\"The 20th century is the most dramatic and violent period in the history of the human race. We killed more people in the 20th century than in any previous century, in the trenches of World War I, in the Soviet Union under Stalin, in Germany under the Nazis, Spain under Franco. There was World War II and the bombing of Dresden by the British and Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was a horrible century and yet it is also the century of liberty.\\"<br /><br />\\"Very few countries were democratic before the First World War. In Britain in 1900, fewer than a quarter of the adult population had the vote. None of the women had the vote in any of these countries, so that's 50 per cent of the people who weren't allowed to take part in democracy. And the franchise was gradually extended to working class men, so democracy really only had a toehold in the world in 1900. Now we take it for granted, certainly in all the countries we think are \\"civilized.\\" And that's a big contrast with what we did in terms of killing each other.\\"<br /><br />FALL OF GIANTS, by telling the engaging stories of the lives of these five families, also tells the story of Europe and its politics as so many nations stumbled foolishly into World War I; as many countries extended the franchise to a small fraction of women and working class men; as Russia toppled their monarchy and moved towards an equally repressive Communist dictatorship after the Bolshevik Revolution; as the USA unilaterally assumed the role of the world's policeman and spearheaded the development of The League of Nations; and as a minor German radical, in the teeth of a crippling imposed peace settlement, implemented the National Socialist party beginning the steady march to a second global conflagration even as many European nations swore, \\"Never again\\"!<br /><br />Some reviewers have criticized Follett's characters as being flat stereotypes. For my money, I saw them as exceptionally well-developed metaphors for broad classes of people that, for one reason or another, would have experienced World War I differently and would have seen the politics and the results of the war from dramatically different perspectives.<br /><br />Billy Williams, to draw only one example from Follett's heavily populated dramatis personae, was an apt representative of England's working class man who, prior to the war, was a coal miner subject to the brutal and self-centered whims of capitalist mine owners. Despite a quick mind and keen wit, he was once again subject during the war to the orders of officers who frequently seemed to lack even a modicum of common sense as to the prosecution of an offensive against Germany. Finally, as the franchise was at long last extended to working men, he served as the illustrative example of the rise of the Labour Party as it came to power in England immediately after the war.<br /><br />It is through this type of metaphorical character that Follett has achieved nothing less than a compelling re-telling of the history of Europe through the first 25 years of the twentieth century! It is not often that I can say that a 1000 page monster has managed to keep me glued to the pages from first to last but FALL OF GIANTS certainly managed it. The depth of understanding of the progress of world history that Follett conveys by looking at events through the eyes of such an enormously varied spectrum of characters can hardly be overstated. English speaking secondary schools around the world might do themselves and their students a favour by considering this as mandatory reading for their history curricula.<br /><br />Highly recommended ... and now I sit and wait for the second instalment in the trilogy!

0385341008|5.0|\\"Every now and again, a book comes along that is simple yet effective, readable yet memorable.  This is one such delight...  It is a uniquely humane vision of inhumanity; one to lift even the most cynical of spirits\\".<br /><br />I have borrowed the above quote from \\"The Times\\" as it summarizes my opinion about this book perfectly.  I absolutely LOVED it!  Exquisitely written in an simple and easy-to-follow epistolary form, we step back in time, just after WW2 in Guernsey and are drawn into the life and issues of each character in an irresistible way.<br /><br />London, 1946.  Meet Juliet Ashton, a writer looking for ideas for her next work.  Her sunny nature, combined with curiosity and the wish to start afresh after the terrible ordeals during the war, are the driving force for a new working project, but... what could she write about?  Blank.<br />Guernsey, 1946.  Meet Dawsey Adams, a farmer who loves books. He comes across a book that once belonged to Juliet.  A correspondence ensues between the two and Juliet learns that Dawsey is a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.  The correspondence continues and Juliet is increasingly intrigued by the vicissitudes of other Society members who start to write to her too, mainly about life in Guernsey during the German occupation.  She reports all that she learns to her dear friends Sophie and Sydney (sister & brother); Sydney is also her boss.  The more she writes about the Guernsey people, the more everyone realises what a remarkable, amazing and fascinating story each Society member has to tell.<br /><br />If there are inaccuracies about Guernsey and/or other details historically and/or geographically speaking, I am, regrettably, not knowledgeable enough on the subject.  However I feel that the book has the quality of a classic.  Poignant, amusing and comforting at the same time, it is highly recommendable.  My true vote: 10 stars!

0525951652|2.0|The complexity of the interwoven coincidences in this novel rivals Dickens. You know, the poor boy, Pip, in Great Expectations is sent to be a playmate to the young, arrogant, ward of the wealthy Miss Havisham. Will they fall in love?  Another young orphan, Oliver Twist, we discover, at end,  is actually the son of a wealthy, but deceased, heiress. Will he be taken in and rescued by the grandfather? Eventually, as we know, all these events turn out for the best, they all have happy endings. But, even with all his coincidences and unlikely events, Dickens is still interesting and so, I guess is Follett's Fall of Giants     Yes, we know from the start that characters from at least five families: Welsh, German, English, Russian, and American  will all eventually fall into relationships with each other, will eventually unite and conflict with each, but the degree of stock characters and circumstances Follett uses is disappointingly predictable. The reader knows from the start that the young, beautiful, strong-minded peasant girl going to work on the estate of the unhappy married and roving Lord will.... well, I won't be a spoiler here. The reader knows as well that when two brothers are separated, two rival brothers at that, they will eventually be reunited. The reader knows that when a father who supports the old ways has a son who supports the new way of political thinking, that.... Well, again I don't want to be a spoiler. The reader knows that when two lovers from two waring countries fall in love, they too will be separated and eventually be reunited, because obviously if this is a trilogy involving these families over the next 100 years and they will have off-spring to continue the plot line into the next war, WW II and presumably into Viet Nam and the mid-East conflict.    The novels's characters, about 70, are linked to all the leaders of the world in some way. So, we have advisors to the President of the United States, senators, and Winston Churchill stopping by for dinner. A frequent thought while reading: \\"Oh, good grief. Come on.\\"     The novel moves through WW I, its causes and the complexity of the alliances made by countries. While the novel takes us into the minds and thoughts of Germans, for example, there is little empathy or insight into these minds. It remains wholly told from the insight of the Allies. So, unlike All Quiet on the Western Front we gain little into the feelings of the German mind or their emotions.    Of course, even knowing the ending, the Allies winning the war, I  did want to finish it, but mostly to see if my other predictions were accurate...they were.

0440178002|5.0|I was first introduced to the story that is Shogun when I was 10 years old and watched the television mini series based upon the novel. Since then I've gone back and watched the show a couple of more times, and I hate to say it, but most of the acting sucked except for Toshiro Mifune as Lord Toranaga. But then, I've always had a soft spot for Mifune because of all the Kurosawa film he's starred in.<br /><br />But the basic plot and background of the mini series was still pretty strong, and it got me to invest in a copy of the actual novel.<br /><br />The story of Shogun begins with Englishman shipwrecked in Japan in the early 1600s, and goes on to become quite political when the Englishman joins in an alliance with a Japanese warlord. Battle ensues. As does a romance. The rest ... well, you'll have to read the novel. I don't like giving away too much information.<br /><br />This novel is a great fish-out-of-water story, basically a story in which the protagonist is dropped into a totally unfamiliar situation and/or setting. Not only is the story good, but it's educational to general readers and to writers, especially fantasy writers because of the uniqueness of the novel's setting, 17th Century Japan.

B000SEGQNS|3.0|I like to wait a week or 2 after reading a book to decide how much I really got out of it.  The answer for this book was \\"not much\\".  The main take-home messages were \\"don't use so many words\\" and \\"usability testing is important and easy to do yourself\\".  I just didn't get much out of it.  The look & feel of most of the examples were so dated it was painful at times.  Most of the content was really shallow and I didn't think told me any more than I already knew.  I guess I would recommend not getting this book if you have ANY previous experience reading web design journals or any other books on the subject.  That being said, some of the examples in the book were worth seeing, and I liked the for-anyones-use letters to bosses who want you to do terrible things at the end of the book.<br /><br />I was also really interesting the the usability testing portion of the book - but it was also too shallow.  Maybe I'll give the \\"rocket surgery made easy\\" book a try.<br /><br />Worth borrowing but not buying.
1439177783|4.0|Portia is an amzing writer. Her tale is gripping, captivating, and horrifying at the same time. This book reads like a page-turner and most readers will really enjoy the journey that she takes you on.    I also think it is a timely and true tale of how the influences of the media, Hollywood and the \\"thin-ideal\\" have come to dominate the way women feel about their bodies, that we are never \\"good enough\\" the way we are, and that we should always be comparing ourselves to others. In that way, I think that almost every woman will be able to relate to her story, eating disorder or not. But if you have ever had an eating disorder, you will recognize the triggers she writes about, and her story's darkness will be very familiar.    For those who are looking for help in these pages for their own eating disorder, what I will say is that this is NOT a book that really encourages recovery, I mean it is obviously an encouragement to live a healthy life, but you won't find helpful recovery advice or direction here - just so you know. As another review states, recovery is almost an afterthought in this book. So, be careful if yoou are sensitive to books that trigger. I am not discouraging buying the book, but I just think it makes a helpful review to know what you are and what you are not getting. As someone who has \\"intimate knowledge\\" of living with anorexia and bulimia, I will say that this is like looking in the mirror. Family memebers who don't understand the pain may also find it enlightening.    If you are looking for books to take you to the next step and point you toward recovery, or if you have a family member with anorexia or bulimia symptoms but is still very thin, I HIGHLY recommend to book \\"100 Questions and Answers about Anorexia Nervosa\\" by Dr. Sari Fine Shepphird. It is the best, most helpful book I have in my collection and I have been reading books about eating disorders for 15 years. If you want to know more about eating disorders like anorexia, it's so helpful. I also want to recommend \\"Crave: Why you binge and how to stop\\" by Dr. Cynthia Bulik, if you are looking for a book specifically about Binge Eating, on the opposite end of eating disorders.    Thank you, Portia, for your honesty. People need to see how this disorder ravages lives but that there is also life after an eating disorder.
B0020JI14G|4.0|I have to say that I do understand Pearl Jam's interest in having Brendan remix Ten.  By the same token, I have to say that I prefer the original mixes.  History has shown us that PJ has not always had their own best interests at heart, and this, to me, is one of those times.  The thing about this album is that it was a direct link from what was the present at the time it was made, to the glories of the rock and roll past.  By that I mean, they had made an album in the early 90's that hearkened back to the soulful dynamics of great stuff like Hendrix and Zeppelin albums, and yet they belonged to \\"our\\" generation.  If you took Are You Experienced or Zoso and remixed them for today, it would never be an improvement.  They were both distinctively 'of a time' and in the same moment, 'timeless.'  I feel the same about Ten.  I want \\"Black\\" to sound as close as it sounds far away.  Let that reverb hold me in it's wave like it did when I first listened to it over and over almost 20 years ago.  A lot of less stellar releases from this time period sound cheesy because they were cheesy, no matter what the mix was.  Ten is not now, nor has it ever been cheesy!  This album came out of the early 90's.  Why should we re-visit it as if it came from any other time?

I've recently finished the Percy Jackson series and &#34;The Red Pyramid&#34; and I can't wait to read the other book to the new series and one thing I really like about how Rick Riordan writes is that every time I read his books I can't put them down and I think that's what makes his books so good!:D

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|From the first words that Marcus Mumford utters, to the last note of the album, I am transfixed. How to describe something like Sigh No More? The raw emotion you can hear in the singers voice is beautiful, the harmonies of the rest of the band make it even better. The music, the lyrics, it all blends wonderfully. I was hooked as soon as I heard the first words, and the band has stuck with me. Wonderful.
B002UXRGLG|4.0|If you liked \\"Planet Earth\\" you'll likely find this series worth your time and money. There is enough new material to keep your interest and David Attenborough's narration, to me, is far preferable than an American celebrity's efforts. I don't subscribe to cable TV and PBS provides a limited number of nature shows, so this is a welcome addition.

B001992NW4|5.0|I read the book when it came out, and it scared me. Against my better judgement, I then saw the movie when it was released, and it affected me down to my core. It has taken me 36 years to get up the nerve to buy the movie myself; I had never watched it again since seeing it in the theater. I watched the special features first, which helped, but this movie remains one of the most frightening movies I have ever seen.   The special features are excellent, as they take you behind the scenes to show how many of the visual effects were achieved. As the adult Linda Blair says, \\"I don't think anybody knows how much I had to go through to make this movie\\", referring to the contact lenses, intense make-up towards the middle and end of the movie, and the intense cold of the set that she had to handle with just thermal underwear under her nightgown while everyone else was bundled in coats.  The extra 8 minutes or so are interesting and add a bit of filler to the story; the only shocking addition is the 'spider-walk' down the stairs which was in the book but which was left out of the movie because (in an age without digital computerization) they couldn't get the wires invisible enough on the stunt girl as she came down the stairs, so they gave up on the shot. It's here now!  I'm surprised that they didn't digitally remove the wires from the levitation scene during the exorcism too because they are still visible, albeit faintly, although I recall being so transfixed by the action on the screen that I never noticed them when I saw the film in the theater in 1974.  Blu-ray sound and picture and the extras make this classic even better, and if you like horror movies done well, you'd have to go far and wide to find one better than this movie, but don't watch it late at night! Even after all these years, and no matter how many times you've seen it, this movie still packs quite a punch.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|The Toy Story movies have elevated \\"children's movies\\" to truly astonishing heights. To say that this is the best of the three might give the impression that the other two were somehow worse than this, so it is perhaps best to take them as a whole and say: These three movies are truly, without a doubt, classic, from beginning to end. They're funny, touching, heartwarming, exciting, imaginative, beautiful, and full of wonder and joy.<br /><br />Pixar is the most consistent studio for quality films, and they deliver once again with Toy Story 3. It will satisfy anyone - young, old, or in between.
0307346617|5.0|Thought this was an amazing book and it was hard to put down. Not the non-stop action you get with other books like Day by Day Armagedon, as this is told from a very different perspective... that of interviews of a variety of survivors. Through reading these it takes a while to finally piece together the history of all the events and I really like the way the author did this. Excellent read. Very creative. Thought it answered many of the questions that most books can't tell from the narrative perspective.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|I was never a fan of AIC until i saw them play live with the velvet revolver in 07. I've heard some of their songs on mtv headbanger ball or something. Lately, i'd been looking for new music from that Seattle grunge era. Alice in Chains popped up apparently. Later I found out AIC released a new album with all new materials. It's really worth a try. It's just that magical. I instantly fell in love with all their music literally. Plus, i watched a few guest appearance performances on some talk shows. They're just stunning even so after many years. They're still in their top form.    Back to the BGWTB album. A couple notable songs i've got to mention: A Looking in View, Check my Brain, Last of my Kind, Lesson Learned. Obviously those I mentioned are the AIC heavy headbanging songs. Surprisingly, they've recorded quite a few acoustic tunes: Your Decision, Black gives way to blue, etc. Back Gives way to blue really moved me by no means. All the tracks were recorded, edited, produced beautifully. What I love about this is that an old band from the 90s sounds still so fresh and new in 2010, soon to be 2011.     AIC seriously considered a comeback, the effort they've put into this is just magnificent. It is not simply an appreciation album. It's a showcase of what the new lineup are capable doing and setting their pace on where to go musically. In various interviews, the band had shown interest in recording another studio album in the near future. I guess BGWTB is just the beginning. I personally see lots of potential in this band.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|One of the best works by Nicholas Sparks. HEs my favorite author. Im only eleven but I love his books even though they are for adults. A true heart-breaker. BRAVO!
B003EYVXT6|4.0|This movie is not your typical Sci-fi Horror movie, which is probably why I liked it.  The \\"monster\\" is really less a  monster and more a bizarre hybrid human pet that has all the emotions of a living breathing human being.  The scientists end up getting attached to their female creation and name her \\"Dren\\".    The plot itself isn't all that original, but does keep your attention after the first tedious 20 minutes of the film.  Splice has a basic story structure:  Scientist genetically creates a dangerous monster, with intentions of helping mankind.  Creation escapes the confines of a controlled environment and ends up killing almost everyone.  Kinda same story as Deep Blue Sea, but totally different movie.    You could compare this movie to Species, but its not as erotic nor as violent as Species.  I think the erotic element in this movie could have been stepped up a notch.  After all, having sex with a semi-attractive alien creature, is probably every person's deep down sexual fantasy, whether they want to admit it or not. In my opinion, the scenes where the scientists end up \\"getting it on\\" with their creation, could have shown more than just their facial expressions. I think Dren could have had more attractive legs, rather than frog legs, which would have made the erotic scenes more believable and appealing.     This movie has a tasteful amount of violence in it. Its not your typical gore, blood splattering, organs spewing horror flick, which puts a cheese factor into most horror movies today anyways.  More emphasis is put into character development and emotional turmoil, which most sci-fi horror movies fail to due, resulting in mind-numbing violence.      Overall this movie is very entertaining and worth watching.  I recommend it for its originality and creative creature accomplishment... it should get a movie award for this, if there is such as thing.. lol
0465043577|4.0|The \\"interconnected world\\", which mankind has created, has outpaced the evolution of our gene pool's capability in dealing with the new \\"unmanageable\\" complexity. We can now through the internet communicate and interconnect at the speed of light; clearly we have reached a physical limit. In economic sense we have created the ultimate \\"bubble machine\\" and our political systems are becoming more and more dysfunctional. We have the paradox that with the exponentially increased and \\"democratized\\" access to information, now more than ever, \\"information asymmetry\\" seems to be ruling our economic and political processes. Consequently, our interconnected world is increasingly unstable and the gap between the \\"have and have nots\\" is increasing, clearly we can see the notion of \\"the winner takes all\\" taking center stage again.<br />Good old \\"analytical reductionism\\" and \\"mother mathematics\\" will not help us anymore. We will be passing for a while through an ever more volatile phase with increasing seemingly random sequences of inflection points. The good old \\"regression to mean\\" will not apply anymore (if it was ever applicable to economic, political, social and biological processes). The new reality will be \\"regression to the extreme\\" (Winner takes all, just like evolution). Assuming that one can diversify \\"risk\\" of non stationary, interdependent processes full of convoluted and not well understood feedback loops through mindless applications of stochastic calculus was the fallacy of the 20st century and the abuse of mathematics. Regression to the Extreme, \\"the winner takes all\\", can be mathematically described by power functions. Benoit Mandelbrot's theory of fractals could provide a much better understanding of managing risk in an ever more dynamic, complex and interconnected global economy. This book consists of three parts, first an examination of the current \\"bell curve\\" based theories (CAPM, MPT, Black-Scholes), followed by an explanation of Mandelbrot's methodology (fractal analysis), and finally important questions that should be addressed and studied (Mandelbrot asserts that virtually all the current theories governing financial risk should be reexamined under more realistic assumptions). The famous and beautiful Mandelbrot set is a special form of power functions. It is a mathematical set of points in the complex plane, the boundary of which forms a fractal. The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex values of c for which the orbit of 0 under iteration of the complex quadratic polynomial zn+1 = zn^2 + c remains bounded.tal analysis), and finally important questions that should be addressed and studied (Mandelbrot asserts that virtually all the current theories governing financial risk should be reexamined under more realistic assumptions).

B003F3NDWG|5.0|I was a skeptic at first.  I knew the show was out there, but never bothered to see any episodes.  I finally decided to get it because I liked Nathan as an actor.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  Maybe not at first, but the show slowly grew on me.  Now I have to say I find everything about it excellent. The comedy is good, the stories are good and the romance.... keeps you coming back for more!  I also love the fact they have two actual books written by Richard Castle.  I read them both - they are just as good.  Watch the show - you'll love it!
B0042X9L6A|4.0|I'm a big fan of the Nikon CLS wireless flash system and I have several Nikon speedlights that I use for high quality portable lighting. Overall, the system works really well, and armed with a few flashes and some simple clamps, I can get creative off-camera lighting nearly anywhere (for on-camera flash, I tend to use the Quantum units). Yes, it's infrared line-of-sight and doesn't have the range of other radio systems, but for me, it's fine.    I have a pair of SB900 flashes and have been very impressed with them in terms of light quality, ease of use and so on - my only complaint is the bulk and weight. I also have a few SB600 units, which are more compact - but they don't offer the same even, high quality lighting I get with my SB900. For whatever reason, I always find the SB600 too hot in the center, and somehow \\"harsh\\". I end up using various diffuser attachments, and by then, I get all the bulk of the SB900, and only half the output.     I figured I'd try an SB700, hoping to get light quality of the SB900 in a smaller, more convenient package. So far, I haven't been disappointed.     Operationally, the SB700 is very similar to the SB900 - mostly the same menus, switches and options. This is a blessing for me because the older SB600 was so different from the SB900 that I'd have to spend a lot of time figuring out how to get it to do what I wanted.     The power, light quality and recycle time are also quite good on the SB700. I get recycle time under 3 seconds with Lithium batteries, and light output seems to be within about 30% of the SB900. All the SB900 options are available, including zoom, \\"even\\" flash (less falloff in the corners) and so on. The device weighs in at about a pound with batteries and it's notably smaller than the big brother SB900 (but heavier than the SB600). Construction quality is about what you'd expect, and there are even optional weather \\"boots\\" that cover the hotshoe contact so water can't seep between the flash and your camera in damp locations.     Some have complained about the SB900 and it's thermal shutdown feature. The SB700 seems to work differently - when it detects temperatures rising, it slows down the recycle time, giving the flash tube time to cool. I suppose this is better than the SB900 (which just stops working if the flash tube hits a certain temperature).     The one complaint others have pointed out is that there's no standard PC jack, making it difficult to operate the flash via a standard PC cord. There are various alternatives if you need this capability, including an add on device with a hot shoe to PC adapter, but it can be annoying if you have accessories requiring PC cord connections.    Otherwise, I think it's a fine flash that Nikon owners will appreciate. Definitely recommended, either as part of an ambitious system or as your only flash.
B001VNB54A|4.0|First, this doesn't follow one unit from basic training to war's end like BoB, so it's may not seem as cohesive as BoB (moving in between the three main characters in at least two different units, plus secondary characters).  The Melbourne liberty episode was very boring, by that time i still hadn't connected with the any of the characters to care about how they spent their liberty pass.  The characters in BoB were more fleshed out early on, i think  than in the Pacific.   I think it would have benefitted from more basic training scenes to establish the characters better.    The character I least liked was Leckie, but his best episode was when he ended up at the mental ward on Parvuvu (that was the first time I started to connect with the guy, but that connection was brief since he seemed deemphasized in later episodes when Sledge arrived on the battlefield).  Basilone was a true hero (his heroics on Guadalcanal were inspiring), and his story was very interesting (it was a little slow when he came back stateside, but got better when he arrived at Camp Pendleton and met his future wife).  Sledge, I think, was the real main character (sad seeing the transformation from idealistic boy, to cold killing machine, then later regret for the humanity he lost on the battlefield).    As for the brutality (of the Japanese and some of the Marines) and the racial aspects, well that was the \\"DNA\\" of the Pacific war.  I've seen many documentaries (I think one included with in the special features) where Pacific vets admit those things did happen.  It's not to excuse or condemn the Marines, but to understand them.  I think it does a disservice to them to deny the racism of the times, or to gloss over their experiences because we don't like it in today's world.  I don't think you can excuse the brutality of the Japanese, however: the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan Death March, etc.  I would hope that I would act differently under similar conditions (an enemy who doesn't surrender, whosewounded kill our medics trying to help them, or who torture prisoners and mutilate the dead), but I am not so sure.      All in in all, the Pacific was pretty good, but uneven (not consistently as good as Bob).
0525951652|4.0|True, prices for eBooks are over the top - but I assume Mr Follett has little to do with that. He does have everything to do with the quality of the book though and this is such a great book that I would (almost) forgive Amazon (or whoever is setting these ridiculous prices). The History, the characters, the love stories, WWI, the Russian revolution... everything is beautifully mixing and once I started this book, I could just not put it down. I can't wait for the 2nd and 3rd volumes - hoping that by then, pricing committees will have gotten some senses.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|******SPOILERS***The Lost Hero is a new series in the same universe as the Percy Jackson books.  Not only does Riordan introduce us to new heroes in  Jason, Piper, and Leo, but he brings back so many favorites from Camp Half Blood.  We also get to see more of Thalia (spoilers ahead)*****who turns out to be Jason's sister.  There is also a promise of more Percy to come in the next book.  The combining of the Greek and Roman mythologies was a great touch.  And the surprise ending was wonderful and left us all longing for more.  Riordan is a master at work.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />**NOTE: Reviewed the Kindle edition.

Hayley Williams is always great and of course Jeremy and Josh and everyone else's craziness.
B0041OOJNU|1.0|I suppose it should not be too much of a surprise since her last album was terrible.  This album is completely disjointed.  It jumps back and forth between pop songs and ballads, reggaeton, elecronic pop songs and salsa/merengue type songs. You can't listen to the whole thing straight through because there are bad songs woven throughout the album and the style changes so much from song to song.  I'm only on my second listen so perhaps I should not be bashing it so much yet.  Waka Waka is a great song but is not really new.  There may be four or five other songs on here that I would say are pretty good.  The three reggaeton songs are terrible and will probably never see the light of day on the radio.  My advice is to not by the whole album but do give it a listen and buy the individual songs that you like.  I'm a big fan of hers other than these last two albums.
B0041VV03A|1.0|Whew! The female and male lead roles were very...hmmmmmm...annoying. Stupid, actually. Both characters behaved so improbably for scientists that I had a difficult time not stopping the movie. Once started, I had to see where they took this story, so I only fast-forwarded periodically after the halfway point. The last few minutes were actually the best since both characters then began to behave as real people would behave. So, unless you really like strange movies with unbelievable characters, don't watch this movie (or at least wait until you can rent it for a buck). 'Sorry for the negative review, but it really was BAD.
B0001FGBD4|5.0|Have wanted to hear a SACD for the longest of times. With the recent price drops I thought I would give it a try finally. So I purchased a [[ASIN:B0036WS4CK Sony BDP-S470 3D Blu-ray Disc Player]] which has DSD output via an HDMI 1.3 connection to my Pio SC-07. The range of music on this CD has given me a true understanding of what SACD is capable of. And new avenues of music to explore. As a sampler CD I think it really ranks as a keeper and one that I know I will play often because it actually has very good music and audio quality.
0199267170|5.0|*****<br />This is the an excellent reference. For actual scholarship, you may want a different volume, but only because it's annoying to have to flip back to the end of the book for commentary and explanation on, well, pretty much everything. Nonetheless, the volume is affordable and good. I  highly recommend it!<br /><br />On a coffee scale, I'd rate it a standard cup o' joe. It's just good to have on hand.<br />*****
B001AQO3XS|4.0|While generally good, there are certain shortcomings in the blu-ray version.  There seems to be an uneven quality in the video, especially between the parts of the film that are from the theatrical release and those segments added to this \\"director's cut\\".  There are a couple of scenes where the sound seems a bit tinny.<br /><br />Despite these problems, the great majority of this release is better on blu-ray.

My Rebel with my 75mm to 300mm attached on the camera fits in here very nicely.  It has various other pockets for additional items.

B0033PQXFA|3.0|Tony Attwood has authored the comprehensive guide to Asperger's Syndrome (AS).  It is exhaustively detailed and will appeal to those preferring a complete treatment.  Attwood is a leading expert on autism spectrum disorders and well qualified to introduce this topic and explore it in depth.<br /><br />The first two chapters introduce Hans Asperger's early observations of children with \\"mild autistic personality disorder\\" and their unique pattern of social, emotional, and linguistic differences.  He identifies AS on a continuum of natural abilities between autism and normal (\\"neurotypical\\").  The relative advantages of seeking a confirmed AS diagnosis are explored along with possible misdiagnoses such as ADHD or a mood disorder.  Newly diagnosed \\"Aspies\\" may slip into one of four common compensation strategies:  reactive depression, escape into imagination, denial and arrogance, or imitation of a \\"normal\\" model.  Readers are acquainted with formal diagnostic criteria for AS and several scales and questionnaires useful for diagnosis.<br /><br />Chapters Three through Eleven discuss the distinguishing features of AS in depth.  Each chapter covers research findings, individual differences, coping strategies, and AS strengths as well as challenges.  AS individuals have different experiences with social understanding and friendship, teasing and bullying, \\"theory of mind\\" in understanding others, understanding and expressing emotion, hobbies or \\"special interests,\\" language, cognitive ability, movement and coordination, and sensory sensitivity.  The treatment of each feature is coherent and comprehensive.  The summaries which follow each chapter are excellent outlines of key ideas and conclusions.<br /><br />The closing four chapters explore the implications of AS for attending college, embarking on a career, and succeeding in a long-term romantic relationship.  Usefulness of psychotherapy for AS individuals and their family members is also explored.  This book's appendices are well-organized and add significant value.  The glossary and reference section are extensive.

B003VANOFY|5.0|The WOW headset looks really good, but the Logitech headset is way better.  This is not an exhaustive comparison and I'm not a audiophile so sound quality is not my thing, but I've seen mostly good reports about both headsets.  Those who care about absolute quality probably can tell you more.     I can't address the negative reviews you can find for the G930, but all I can say is I had only one issue I will address in a minute.   I wanted to get the WOW headset from the first day I heard they were going to be available and I think I waited almost 9 months.  I waited a little longer and the problem with the WOW headset is there have been alot of reports of the right earcup breaking off of them within just a few weeks to months of purchasing them.  Read the WOW reviews on amazon.    I've seen zero reports of the G930 breaking (at least pieces falling off of them).   For both headsets there have been software issues reported by individual users... but it seems to me the WOW headsets had alot more of those issues.  I read alot of the reviews and there seem to be alot more reports of the WOW headsets giving problems with Ventrilo that could not be fixed by the end user.    The battery life for both headsets is awesome 8-9 hrs of playing Starcraft.   The G930 charges fully in about 2hrs if your computer is on.  My USB charges very slowly if the computer is off.  It may not be fully charged after 24hs if the computer was off the whole time.   If you just get in the habit of plugging them in when your taking a break you should be fine.    Lastly the issue I had.   In SC2 they support the surround sound feature for these headphones.  In fact if you don't use the surround sound the volume in each ear cup is different and feels strange to listening.   The problem is when I'm in vent if I have the surround sound on I can't hear what anyone is saying.  When I turn it off I hear them , but have the issue I just mentioned.  I play with it off when I play in groups.   A fix would be just use the built in \\"in game\\" sound and everything works just fine, but my friends insist on using Ventrilo for some reason.    A tip.. right next to the power button there is another switch.   That is the button I used to turn surround sound on and off.  There may be a software feature to fix the issue I had with Vent., but I coudln't figure it out.    Bottom line... these are a close to perfect as you are going to get for a while.   I did hear there was another brand coming out with some awesome headphones around Christmas time though.  I think it was Monster or something like that.
1597801585|2.0|I don't really get the good reviews on this book. This was a total waste of time. Like several people already pointed at, the science part doesn't make any sense and is totally uncreative (save the GMO subplot that could be better exploited by another sci-fi writer someday). That's a problem when the whole book is based about it. The characters are all boring, including the compulsory anti-hero (and I am not even talking about the sexbot which is refered to in the book title but doesn't bring anything new in the field of robot/conscience). Despite my boredom, I went through the whole book hoping to find something to like or a surprise. Unfortunately, this book didn't delivered from start to finish. The cover is fantastic though.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas being my favorite movie, for years I watched the VHS I owned. I searched in multiple stores for a DVD version, in fear that my VHS player would soon give out.     The features were more in depth than in my original VHS version, and the commentary was a nice addition.   Still my favorite movie, and a great collection item. For the avid fans, there is also a DVD version available with a collectible Jack Skellington head and Santa hat attachment.     Enjoy!
1593272782|1.0|I was very excited to get this book after many months of waiting but it turned out useless.<br />At first, the models look inspiring but when I wanted to start building with my son, we were missing many small parts although we do have an incredible amount of Lego pieces at home. For example, a special kind of Lego technic gear or some pumps.<br />Worst, you can't buy the parts easily, since they are not for sale on the Lego website. After researching, I found out these parts are sold for schools so you may buy them at a special shop but they are only parts of sets, a few pieces here, a few parts there and they are not cheap, even by Lego standards.<br />I sent the book back to Amazon with the other two from the same author.

B003MOHX8S|5.0|I'm thrilled to see Two Steps from Hell has gone \\"public\\" with the release of Invincible. I've long said that Two Steps and outfits like them (Immediate Music, X-Ray Dog, etc.) would make a fair profit if they also sold their music to the public, as albums. They could still charge for licensed usage in trailers. And here we are... some of TSFH's greatest tracks, available for purchase!    If you've ever watched a movie trailer and said \\"what was that music?\\" then this is the album for you. These tracks are meant to invoke emotion from the listener, that is specifically why they are created and paired with stunning visuals in movie trailers! The price is right, too. If you're not big on trailer music to begin with, but like film soundtracks in general, give this album a try. You'll recognize very similar scoring techniques - imagine taking some truly powerful cues from film scores and distilling them down to bite-size tracks - and some really inspirational pieces.    If you like this, also check out Globus' album 'Epicon.' The album features Immediate Music trailer music with slight edits and/or vocal overlays, some of which truly add to their underlying tracks. Also, E.S. Posthumus has two albums out with similar music.

1439153663|4.0|Tells the story of Lavinia, a 7 year old orphaned at sea on her way from Ireland to America.  Lavinia finds herself living as an indentured servant with the slave women in the \\"kitchen house\\", and this becomes her family.  The story goes on to tell what happens to the family, how their lives are dependent and intertwined in the most serious way with the plantation owner's family.  Some reviewers didn't like the summarized narratives - I think they worked, because it was like reading someone's diary and lent an authentic telling of the story.  I also liked that the author created some complicated characters, like Marshall.  There were times you empathized with him, were touched by his caring and at others, horrified by him.  My only criticism would be, the summary at the end of the novel could have been edited a bit more, so as leave the same result, but just a bit better flowing to keep a consistent amount of tension.    That being said, I'd definitely recommend this book.
B000002A46|5.0|There isn't too much to say about this CD except that it is one of the Best Christmas CDs out there ever!  It is soulful, full of gospel, and spiritual. Too often, many artists try to make original Christmas songs and fail miserably, or change Christmas songs so that they sound like hip-hop, rock, etc., but NOT like Christmas. Or they avoid the religious/spiritual element. This CD embraces gospel, Christianity, and just plain ol' good quality music. Every song on this CD is well arranged. My family pulls out this CD every holiday season and it doesn't get old! Mariah is coming out with another Christmas CD soon. I'm not sure how she can top this!!!
1936041359|5.0|First,<br />I absolutely love sitting by a river, quietly for hours.<br />The idea of being a ferryman, by a river in rural India, for the rest of my life, carried me away with joy.<br />Second,<br />Having studied Buddhism for many years, I have gotten very frustrated when it gets too intellectual and non-relevant, so by making enlightenment ordinary and achievable, this novel is an inspiration.<br />Third,<br />The legendary Buddha had to make the choice between entering non-existense or becoming the world renowned teacher -- with all the complexities and complications which that responsibility would bring.<br />I think that it is quite possible that the Buddha would have envied the simple life of enlightenment,<br />lived by the ferryman, next to the flowing river -- I know I do.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|First of all, if you didn't like the musical, forget about it. Do not read the review and do not buy the soundtrack.    However, if you've enjoyed the show as much as I have, you're going to love the soundtrack!     For those who didn't have the luck to watch the show in 2003-04 (like me) and missed the breathtaking performance of Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel, here's the chance for us to hear the voices of the two Broadway divas, whom the roles were originally written for.    As much as we have some emotional attachment to the cast we first saw, we can't deny the fact that the roles, the songs were originally written for Kristin and Idina and thus are designed to magnify their uniqueness and strengths... and they did have the most touching vocal performance.     I can't argue technically which singers are the most skilful in handling the music, but I do feel that this Original Broadway Cast touched my heart the most... You can argue about flaws and who and who is better, but acting is not just about technical perfection, it's about the connection to emotions and this pair have found their ways into the souls of many, many of us...    If you close your eyes and listen to just the music, the way they performed with their voices, the way they delicately articulated each word vividly brought me back to the scenes and helped me visualize the story again. It brings back so the emotions you experienced during the show, the funniest parts like \\"What is this feeling\\" and \\"Popular\\", the most heart-wrenching moments like \\"No Good Deed\\" and \\"For Good\\". Till now, when I have a quiet moment and if I'm really focused on the CD, it still brings tears to my eyes, it still chokes me...     I enjoyed every single song in the CD as in the live performance I did miss the beauty of some songs... when I get the CD and the lyrics I appreciates the songs even more...    If I had to make one complaint - I wish this would be a full recording of the show including the dialogues in between, like the Les Miz 3-CD set... That would be even more wonderful for Wicked fans... and I love the voices of Idina, Kristin and Norbert, I would love to hear them speak on top of the singing part...     Just love it! It's just so wickedly beautiful and be careful that once you let it cast a spell on you, it's not reversible!
B003ZJUIG4|5.0|2013 UPDATE:<br />I'm happy to see the complete track listing finally posted for this excellent 2-CD reissue (my original review lamented the fact that there were no details on the songs for the reissue when this was first reissued). I bought a copy at a shop in Kuala Lumpur last year and have been playing it a lot since then.  The original album STILL sounds marvelous. There is such a vibrant spirit and real SOUL in these songs; musical magic! Kevin and the band, to my ears, never sounded finer, or happier, or more triumphant than on this album. There are a few cover tunes mixed with the original Dexy's numbers on the album, but it's all performed so seamlessly and so well that if you didn't know that some of these songs were covers, you would think they are all Dexy's originals. For further icing on this delicious cake of an album, the package is now augmented with the extra tracks on the second disc; a mix of B-sides, alternate takes, Peel Sessions recordings and a few more fun cover tunes. Some of it is overkill --- I'm not sure that I needed to hear 3 versions of \\"The Horse\\" for example --- but this is still a thrilling listen 30 years later.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The 6-year old and the 4-year-old were absolutely mesmerized by this movie. Adults will appreciated the story, the animation, the excellent actors who do the voices, which are very well matched to the video. I've since bought several other Miyazaki movies. They are all wonderful.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|I went into BB to buy the TS3 Blu Ray Combo pack with a coupon. I already own the first two TS movies on DVD. But after doing the math in my head of the money I had planned to spend on the Blu Ray editions of those this was an easy choice. I had contemplated doing the Disney DVD to Blu for the other two movies but even at 8 dollar off coupons the price still well exceeded the box set. Although one negative that I was unsure of going in was the Digital Copy of the films. It doesnt say it on the box packaging but they are included as well. Over all this like X-Men, and Spiderman trilogys are amazing because they give you all 3 versions of the film. I have a copy for the road for my daughters portable DVD player and her toy room, and blu ray for the living room. And the digital copy for my ipod's. Awesome value if you dont have any of the on blue ray this is the best value.<br /><br />And if you want jeweled case drop 6 bucks at target or BB or where ever and get a pack of 100.
0740785508|5.0|it's an awesome book! it doesn't teach you how to draw or make things, but it does tell you to keep A LOT of things in mind  when working on a project.  It's extremely helpful!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan does a great job connecting The Lost Hero to The Last Olympian,and writing the book in three characters points of view.
1453837736|3.0|Pride and Prejudice is a thread of ammunition in today's literary cannon.  Being that it is, I felt I should read it.  The plot in the book is very straight forward.  Having been produced in the 19th century and entailing the reader with a striking and classic love scenario gives it historical leverage.  What other 19th century novel can intertwine social class, love, and crazy parents?<br /><br />  Austen's portrayal of social class played a responsibility in the novels greatness.  Binding social class and love conveyed it to the current time.  I especially enjoyed when the book started to occlude and Elizabeth was confronted by Lady Catherine regarding her love for Mr. Darcy.  That moment was significant because it showed that social class does not dignify a person's love.  Imagine you were teaching this tale to high school students: They could feed off of it in so many ways.<br /><br />  I will admit that this work of fiction was complex at times, but the more I asked questions, the easier it was to understand.  I watched the movie (2006 version) after I finished the book.  Everything that I had envisioned the book to be about was correlated directly in the movie.  The benefit of watching the movie was that it sufficed some of the minimal elements in Austen's book I was unsure of.  I may read this book again, and if I do I would like to have a group to read it with. It always helps to talk out-loud distinguished novels like Pride and Prejudice so readers can pin-point missed segments and unlock blocked thoughts.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|throughly ejoyed this book.  Superb pace and fow.  Story keeps you wanting more to include the ending.
0553805371|4.0|Hawking and Mlodinow's \\"The Grand Design\\" is a well crafted treatise on the early history of the Universe we know. Hawking never pretends to know the answer for how the Universe came about to begin with (law of gravity?), how many universes there are, etc. He and Mlodinow instead make a case for multiple universes, each set in motion by its own physical laws, and each growing as a living organism. Some have environments conducive to emerging complex life forms, while most others do not. Ours is one of who-knows-how-many that actually supports life.<br /><br />Hawking and Mlodinow employ the analogy of the \\"Game of Life,\\" a popular board game around for many years. This game offers in two dimensions what multiple and intersecting universes offer in many dimensions. Normally we think of the four we are familiar with: the three spatial dimensions (L, W, & H) and time. Since space and time are interconnected, as Einstein taught us, we can simplify this by saying \\"space-time.\\" Evidence arguably exists for other dimensions as well.<br /><br />In the \\"Game of Life,\\" life is generated or perpetuated by two living neighbors (three is a crowd and one or zero is lonely to the point of deadly). Some patterns set in motion move and expand on their own. The organism that is the Universe can be said to do the same. It's all a matter of perspective. If we stay in the forest, we see only the trees. If we rise above the forest, we can see the surrounding landscape and beyond.<br /><br />That is Hawking and Mlodinow's main point. Eventually, we will understand enough about the Universe and its position among other universes (if they exist) to be able to see how they intersect and how their respective sets of physical laws play off against or perhaps even mesh with each other. Time will tell.<br /><br />As for now, we can't say too much. I agree with that assessment, although Hawking and Mlodinow beg the question on how did the law of gravity itself originate. Hawking has always been an honest scientist who operates very well within his area of expertise. From a religious standpoint, I consider him a closet deist (all matter was created by an intelligence and then set in self-sustaining motion; note: Hawking is a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences) who comes across in practice as an atheist or agnostic. Hawking simply does not speculate beyond the realm of science. And that is OK with me. Another solid effort and a worthy companion to \\"A Briefer History of Time.\\" Fr. Dennis
B003J7HOKU|4.0|Deep Blue may not have been what everyone expected from Parkway Drive, but you cant rate it based on how you expect the band to progress. Deep Blue is awesome. I cant stop listening. This album still sounds like Parkway Drive, its just slowed down and really heavy at times. The guitar work is not as technical, which is unfortunate, but the riffs are still great. There are a lot of breakdowns, and the more I listen to the album, the more I like Parkway Drive's new sound. The vocals are amazing, and along with the lyrics, probably better than their previous records. I want to give this album 5 stars because its so good, but after releasing Killing With A Smile and Horizons, there's a lot to live up to and there is still room for improvement (I would have liked to hear some shredding or some really fast riffs). Parkway Drive didnt show all of their talent in this release, and even so, it just sounds amazing. Give it a listen, you'll know.
0307473473|5.0|The book arrived in perfect condition-It is a non stop thriller-Thank u for the fast service
B003U6BE8I|3.0|I, too, am a big fan of the books and took a group of four kids (two eight year-olds, one ten year old, and one eleven) to see this--only one of whom had read the series. I think all 4 kids modestly enjoyed it, but it wasn't something that they would wish to see again or get on DVD.    Most of the changes from the book were not upsetting. I think using the Parthenon in Nashville was inspired, for example--but that was about the only inspiration in the movie. The ages of the characters were one of the big problems. Instead of having kids the age of the ones in \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" we get fully-fledged teenagers, played by adults. I thought Daddario's performance as Annabeth was particularly off--I didn't think the 23 year old actress was in any way convincing as a 16 yer old character (who should have been 12).    The elimination of Kronos from the plot was, I think, a very poor choice on the part of the film makers, at least it was, if they had any intention of making more of these movies. (So was casting adults who were already too old to be playing kids. So was pulling the hydra out of the second book and putting it in the first movie.) Without the overriding plot of Kronos's awakening, there would be nothing to tie a second movie to the first. I can understand not wanting to complicate the story--which might have become quite confusing with that added layer--but it would also have upped the stakes for the characters--and the viewers.     My biggest problem with the movie was thematic. In all the old myths, the gods kept their distance from their children, not because they were forced to, but because they felt it the best thing for them. By keeping their distance, they allowed their kids to grow and test their own strength, and not rely on their godly-parent to bail them out, or even for advice. By keeping their distance, their children had to become more than just their parent's kid. You can imagine that today's hyper-successful parents face the same dilemma--dothey withhold money and assistance in the hopes that their kids will find their own way? or do they set the kids up with a trust fund so that they never have to achieve anything in their lives?    Instead of using this real theme from mythology, the filmmakers rejected it in favor of modern view of parenthood--of course the gods want to play a part in their kids lives, but Zeus just won't let them. Zeus thinks it will make the gods weak if they associate too much with their kids. So instead of wise and powerful gods, you get whining and weak ones. And instead of a really challenging view of parenthood, we get the same kind of parenthood you see just about everywhere else.
1401323952|4.0|Nigella Lawson writers some very nice cookbooks! I have used a number of recipes from her \\"Nigella Express\\" and found them quite tempting. Here is a new cookbook from her kitchen. She notes the point of this specific work (Page xix): \\"The life of a kitchen takes in many moods and many meals. The recipes in this book try to reflect and, more, to celebrate that fact. . . [T]his one is based on the premise that the kitchen is an enduring place of comfort and that the food which comes out of it provides essential sustenance not just for body, but for soul, too.\\"<br /><br />The book begins with something like \\"Kitchen Confidential,\\" as Lawson lays out her choices for tools in the kitchen (forget cast iron skillets--too much hassle and too heavy, even though they are glorious instruments of cooking), gadgets (like a slow cooker), shortcuts (e.g., boiling water or how to keep onions from browning).<br /><br />Part I focuses on recipes related to \\"Kitchen Quandaries.\\" Recipes abound here, with those catching my fancy including \\"Crisp chicken cutlets with salad on the side, \\"Barbecued ground beef, \\"Chicken teriyaki, \\"Egg and bacon salad,\\" \\"Tarragon chicken,\\" \\"Lone linguini with white truffle oil,\\" \\"Indian rubbed lamb chops,\\" \\"Chicken with Greek herb sauce,\\" \\"Minestrone soup,\\" \\"South Indian vegetable curry,\\" and \\"Pasta with pancetta (what a glorious element in cooking!), parsley, and peppers.\\"<br /><br />Next, a section on \\"Kitchen Comforts.\\" Among these that intrigue me: \\"Date steak\\" (with brown sugar, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, red currant jelly, gingerroot, tomato paste, garlic flavored oil, top loin strip steaks), \\"Chicken with 40 cloves of garlic\\" (a tasty dish indeed!), \\"Saffron risotto\\" (I enjoy a good risotto!), \\"Patara lamb shanks,\\" \\"Greek lamb chops with lemon and potato,\\" and \\"Pork and apple hotpot\\" (hotpots are pretty cool dishes).<br /><br />A nice addition to Nigella Lawson's body of work!
0399536108|5.0|I stumbled across Chris Guillebeau's blog 5 days ago.  I bought the book on Amazon the next day, it arrived 2 days later, and finished it today.  In short, I'm a fan.  I knew I was a fan after 20 minutes of finding his blog (I only wish I had found it sooner).  If you like the ideas and relate to the information found on chrisguillebeau.com you will love this book.  I consider myself to be somewhat of a non-conformist, but I don't think I realized how many decisions I make daily based on other's expectations of me.  It has inspired me to go forward in the life I want, and so far Chris is one of two people rooting me on.  ha!  I have a lot of the same goals, desires, and interests as the author, so I related to this book on a more personal level.  This will (obviously) not be the case for everyone, but I would encourage you to give this book a chance.<br /><br />I'm confused by the negative reviews.  I didn't find this book to be condescending at all.  It's more of a - this is what worked for me, now find what works for you - attitude.  He is not suggesting you must sell your car and visit 30 countries a year to be happy.  He does, however, put forth some good ideas on how to find what happiness means for YOU.  Not someone else.  That's the point.<br /><br />I can't wait to pass my copy on to friends and hear what they have to say!  (But not before I read it again!)
B002JVWR0Y|1.0|First of all, Dexter is a great show, don't get me wrong.  This season, in fact, is worth a five star review for the excellent plot lines, suspense and execution.  The blu-ray also has wonderful picture quality so good you can easily tell some of the scenes that are green screen.  The audio is also excellent.    HOWEVER, the Bluray version of this season FORCES you to watch a 10 minute advertisement every time you put in a disk!  I already know about the other shows on Showtime, I don't need to be reminded.  When I set aside an hour to watch an episode, I don't want to waste 10 minutes of my time waiting for the menu to load.  Showtime/Paramount evidently does not value their consumers' time.    I recommend NOT buying the blu-ray version of this product because of the horrible forced advertising at the beginning of each disk.
B001FZ0A7W|5.0|For me this kind of record is rather out there. It's more like I witness it happening. Their music is always deeper than my peabrain can access. I'm more of a Split Enz guy. I keep listening though. Some of it has to reach me in there. Her voice, as I mentioned in the Silver Tree comments, is otherworldly. His voice reminds me in tone of those 40s, 50s, 60s crooner guys who maybe fell into a vat of the really good stuff. Smooth. I don't care much for the celtic barley stuff--kinda one in the millions of that type. The Carnival is Over is transcendent. How Fortunate...too. Nobody needs to care what I think about this, but Dead Can Dance needs to be in more households.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|What can Wes Anderson not do?  His adaptation of Raold Dahl's book is at turns visually arresting and brimming with wit.  The humor here is subtle and inspired.  I wouldn't recommend this film for younger children not because there's anything to offend a parent's sensibilities but a lot of the material would be over their heads.  This is an adult film but not in the restrictive sense.  Anderson challenges his audience with this film so it's best suited to the intelligence of older children and adults.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|Hey would like to write something short on this beautiful Movie of all time,    Video:who say the HD transfer was bad with this Bluray Edition,but its pretty  good tranfer and the picture quality is very sharp,crisp and even can see the   complete details when closeup shot appear,only there are few scenes look blure or  faded when its only comes to dark shots.    Overall:I give 4 out of 5 for Video Quality.    Audio:Ooh what a nice treat to have sound encoded with Dolby TrueHD,the bass seems to be heavy on songs and vocals are clear and crisp only at time the voice are deemed.    Overall:I can give 4.5 out of 5 for Audio Quality.    Movie:As this is classic of all time with the twist and sexy moves of John Travolta with lucky girlfriend Olivia Newton-John and good acting.    Overall:I can give 4 out of 5 for movie storyline and acting.    Recommendation:This BD is and upgrade from the DVD version interms of Video 1080p and Sound Dolby TrueHD.So go for this Bluray if you like to rock Grease.
B00275EHJG|5.0|When I first heard that Disney was releasing toy story 3 I felt weird, like \\"How are they gonna achieve the succes of the previous movies\\", but God they did it, just buy the dvd, it´s a must , I saw the movie like 6 times when it was released, and now I own the copy, and I just can´t get enough.....:)
B002QW7ALM|3.0|Pandorum begins with a really intriguing premise. Two astronauts Bower (Ben Foster) and Payton (Dennis Quaid) wake up after long hyper sleep in an apparently deserted spaceship \\"Elysium.\\" Because of the side effect of the hyper-sleep chamber, it takes quite a time to remember who they really are or for what they are on board. While struggling to find the clues to their lost memories, Bower and Payton come to know a shocking fact: they are not alone.    I was instantly drawn to the story - and for modestly budgeted movie the production designs of \\"Pandorum\\" are impressive. But the promising story slowly turned into something of a disappointment after a series of clichéd narrative devices and scares. Without spoiling much, I can tell you that the film is co-produced by Paul W.S. Anderson, director of \\"Event Horizon\\" and \\"Resident Evil.\\" This is an old ghost ship story with a difference or two. To me the identity of the \\"ghost(s)\\" is not as interesting as the back story of the spaceship and those who sent it into deep space.     The cinematography by Wedigo von Schultzendorff (\\"13F\\") captures the claustrophobic atmosphere. Director Christian Alvart handles each action scene decently until the overstuffed plot becomes too incredible, barely covering the obvious plot holes (how did they survive in an isolated place such a long, long time?).      \\"Pandorum\\" is a sci-fi action movie with too many subplots going on. If the filmmakers had stuck to the original storyline that deals with the Earth and humankind in the near future, the film could have been much more fascinating.

1846143284|4.0|Ha-Joon Chang, economist at Cambridge University, is a familiar author to many in the general public by now for his persistent and eloquent efforts (when writing) to combat the economic orthodoxy on several major policy points. In particular, he is known for his defense of protectionism as a means to promote economic growth and for his rejection of the idea that 'free trade' and 'free markets' lead to better outcomes than alternatives such as government dirigisme. In \\"23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism\\", he attempts to make the lessons of heterodoxy familiar to as wide a public as possible, addressing 23 orthodox economic clich&eacute;s that are often accepted by a skeptical general public only because they seem to be supported by all in the economic field. In making the counterarguments accessible and generally known, Chang has done the English-speaking world a great service.<br /><br />The 23 things he discusses can be roughly clustered into a number of groups: he discusses the orthodoxies of free trade as against protectionism, the orthodoxies of free markets as against government intervention, the orthodoxies of wage policy (particularly the idea that wages are infallibly determined by individual marginal productivity), the orthodoxy that inequality of income and outcome does not matter, and finally the idea that financial managers and economists know best. On all of these points, he has very important lessons to convey to policymakers, civil servants, and the general public to show that these things should either be rejected out of hand or be taken with a large truckload of salt. Using the strengths of economic history, he accessibly shows in each of these cases how the clich&eacute; is either refuted by the facts or itself an incoherent idea, or both.<br /><br />That said, sometimes his critique does not go quite far enough, and this shows the limitations of Chang's own economic theory standpoint. As he makes clear, the book itself is intended to criticize the orthodoxies of 'free market' capitalism, but not capitalism itself. As a result, his critique is not as powerful and does not convey as many important popular lessons as it could. For example, although he is quite right about the relation between protectionism, government intervention, and growth, he does not criticize the concept of growth itself as the only goal in economic policy, nor does he point out the essential fact that growth can in fact be bad for the median living standard if it causes the distribution of wealth to be more unequal. He also, because of his market economy predilections, vastly understates the success of planned economies historically, despite referring at one point of the book to Robert Allen's excellent research on Soviet industrialization policy. He also does not point out that the strong capitalist investor state he favors itself historically has tended to impede the development of more egalitarian outcomes and tends to be repressive of unions and collective action. Finally, he does not critique any of the assumptions of microeconomics, only macroeconomics.<br /><br />Nonetheless, most of the 23 lessons are well taken and although I have some disagreements with a number of them, they are exceedingly well formulated for public understanding and indeed much closer to a real picture of how capitalist economies work than any of your average macroecon textbooks. It is therefore to be hoped that this book will have a wide audience.'free market' capitalism, but not capitalism itself.

Bruce Wayne/Batman fights crime in Gotham City<br />and faces psychotic clown criminal, \\"The Joker.\\" Heath<br />was the heart of the film and was brilliant.

B003YNFYCO|5.0|Even if you have the original 1993 version of this title, there are basically three reasons to get this new version:    1) It comes from the better sounding 2009 remasters    2) It's not nearly as pricy as the previous version  3) It is packaged in a three sided gatefold sleeve (similar to \\"Past Masters\\")instead of the bulky red jewel case    Other than \\"Past Masters\\", this along with \\"1967-1970\\" is not enhanced but there is a booklet with new liner notes included. It's interesting though that the first four tracks are still in mono. That's understandable for \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"She Loves You\\" because there were no stereo versions for them but \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"From Me To You\\" do have stereo versions even though an argument can be made that they sound better in mono anyway. At any rate, if you have the remasters from last year, then you should definitely get this album to complete your collection.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Adam green had a idea which came to him after his ski trips, that he used to take with his family. If the ski slopes operated only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, what would happen if you were stranded on a ski lift on Sunday night and the operators would not be returning until the following weekend? This is the premise behind ` Frozen' Three friends take a ski trip to a remote mountain in New England ( Utah, actually), throughout the weekend these skiing enthusiasts never get a chance to do some real skiing, so on Sunday decide to go for one last downhill trip. The life operator due to a shift change forgets about these friends and thus they are stuck on the halfway point on the life with no one to help them. The film then follows their struggles and fight for survival against wild life and nature's brute fury.<br />I liked this movie because there is a minimal amount of CGI and locations, the entire action takes place on a ski life, this could have been boring and tedious but these actors do a fine job conveying first the anguish, depression and ultimately fighting to surviving very well. Infact during the final scenes, the events become so drastic and tragic, that you may well find yourself rooting for them to win. I enjoyed this film. 4 stars on 11/4/10
B0007MWZEK|1.0|This product is ok, but I have had nothing but trouble with the payment.  They billed me more than two times! I talked to them on the phone and had my credit card company try to fix things, but after 6 months, it still has not been taken care of.  BE CAREFUL when using a credit card with this company.  I think they make their money by overbilling and never resolving things. This product is certainly not worth the hassle!!!

After his parents are murdered, Bruce<br />Wayne becomes a vigilante hero of Gotham City. I like<br />how this went back to the dark roots and Christian is<br />good in it. This dvd set has nice picture and sound<br />plus neat extras. I recommend this good Batman film.
0312600844|2.0|Two stars are earned by this long and unpleasant book because Franzen can write some very good sentences, but the work as a whole suffers from some major technical flaws, and fails to achieve any end that would justify the journey.  Here's what bothered me the most:         --  Patches of dialogue and short bursts of narrative that move the plot along are interspersed with what must literally be hundreds of pages of exposition, telling the reader what the characters are thinking and why they're doing what they're doing and, usually, what's wrong with them.  I thought that's what readers were supposed to figure out for themselves.  To quote the title of a chapter, a name that one of the characters files away for later use, \\"Enough Already!\\"         --  With modest exceptions, even major characters that are the subject of these endless musings embody sterotypes of the traits that they are describd as having.           -- These cartooney people then proceed through events and vignettes that seem improbable and unrealistic.         -- This book is no more about \\"freedom\\" than it is about dozens of other possible themes that may be teased in a connect-the-dots fashion out of any novel following the intertwined lives of friends, family members, and loved ones over decades.  The absence of a critical mass of three-dimensional characters and and the march of those characters through events that seem staged undermines any effort to charactrize the book as illuminating any aspect of the human condition in an insightful or moving way.    I just don't get the favorable commercial reviews.  What were they thinking?  What were they reading?
B002VPE1OS|5.0|This is the best and cheapest screen protector in the market. It does what it is supposed to do, no fuss at all. I don't get why people complain that it is hard to apply; just follow the directions and take the time to actually check if the screen is completely lint-free. If not, you're going to have those annoying air pockets.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|I have a monitor that has a single HDMI connection and it points straight down.  Inserting a cable requires tilting the monitor or poking around blindly and hoping to hit it right.  Until, that is, I stumbled onto this very handy swivel adapter.  Now I just leave the adapter plugged in all of the time, pivot it to any useful angle and connect the HDMI device.<br /><br />Both the female and male ends pivot nearly 180 degrees but each one pivots on its own plane which allows nearly limitless connection angles.  The gold plated ends have a very firm connection and seem as if they will hold up to the fairly frequent connecting and disconnecting I have in store for it.
B00005QGAT|4.0|November 6th, 2010.<br /><br />This is one groovy album. It's the first album by Michael that I've listened to entirely and liked most of the songs (my other full listen was to 2001's [[ASIN:B00005Q4JH Invincible]] which had a few songs that were noteworthy, but not like this).<br /><br />There are obviously 19 \\"tracks\\" here but some of them are just commentaries about Michael, a bit on how he was and his approach to his songs and such (which I found interesting and still do when listening) or original demos of songs (of which one I liked and one I disliked).<br /><br />Like I said, it is a very smooth, dance-enabling album full of songs that for the most part have similar tempos but are still almost always well-crafted. I actually felt spoiled listening to the set over and over.<br /><br />The filler tracks are kept to a minimum. \\"It's The Falling In Love\\" Feat. Patti Austin is pleasant, although not the best track. \\"Burn This Disco Out\\", the final track on the vinyl version of this album has a nice beat, but also could be stronger. They also put these two tracks right after another which doesn't help. But I don't hate these tracks. I just don't particularly love them and find them filler more than anything. The last of the MOR tracks are \\"Workin' Day And Night (The Original demo)\\". Thankfully it's not really meant to be an album track but a space filler or an extra.<br /><br />Other than that, this is quite a strong offering from Michael and marked his first effort on the Epic label.<br /><br />4.25 stars or an 8.5/10.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"I Can't Help It\\"<br />\\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\"<br />\\"Rock With You\\" & the underrated<br />\\"Girlfriend\\"
B0042AEOG0|2.0|With one of the most powerful voices in the world, Mariah choses to whisper-breathe-sing these songs. I don't understand. If you enjoy that type of singing, you may love these songs. I also think many of these songs are too bad even for Muzak- and I'm normally a huge Mariah fan. Belt them out next time, girl.
B001E45XT4|4.0|The most comfortable headset I've ever worn, and I must have tried 20 of them.  It seems study, but I haven't had it long enough to know.  (But other headset have seemed rickety from the start, and all have broken relatively quickly.)  I like the sound too.  I actually like that they don't block out all other sound, as sometimes someone is trying to talk to me.
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|My home theater system is probably like most. Pending a redesign (upcoming over the next few months,) everything in the back of the system is in tight quarters with little to no room to work. Nowhere is the space crisis more of an issue than with the system cabling.     Forcing HDMI cables to make sharp, tight turns due to lack of space is never a great idea.  The AmazonBasics HDMI Male to Female Swivel Adapter was just what I needed to manage the HDMI cabling issue. It is a compact well thought out design. The flexibility that it offers to the HDMI cables running behind my home theater is a godsend.    There are some concerns here. For one, this kind of cable mobility often carries with it signal deterioration over time. Dust and dirt get inside the adapter and normal wear and tear reduces the conductivity. I don't know if this will occur with the AmazonBasics HDMI Male to Female Swivel Adapter. However, this is something that I will keep an eye on as the adapter ages.    The other concern is what version of the HDMI standard is deployed in the adapter. The Micro connector defined in the HDMI 1.4 specification retains the standard 19 pins, but shrinks the connector size to something resembling a micro-USB connector. This device may not work then with HDMI 1.4 cables. But, for the price, this can be considered a throw away product to be replaced when you upgrade your cables. And, for now, it does the job of reducing cable tensions and mine quite well
B0040YFR1Y|3.0|Watching this movie was like watching a handful of really great sci-fi movies.  A lot of this movie was taken directly from Aliens; some of the dialogue, the music in the beginning was similar, the ship where Noland lived looked just like the Nostromo or Sulaco. Give me a break, if I wanted to watch Aliens again, for probably the 75th time, I would.  When the predator ship was about to take off from the forest the camera shots and lighting reminded me of E.T..  Come on!  I can't say the movie wasn't entertaining because it was. Fishburne gave an outstanding performance, and he always does, he is a great actor.  That crappy drawing of the surrounding planets, repeating the \\"F word\\" every other sentence, the casting was off, and what really gets me is how the doctor knew the name and particulars of a plant on an alien planet, doesn't make any sense, the plot is full of holes. Remaking the original had such potential.  What were the makers of this movie thinking?  Maybe they weren't.

B0042AEOG0|5.0|Indeed, Mariah's first Christmas album has become a timeless classic, and she accomplished a not so easy feat of landing an original Christmas track in the canon of Christmas favorites with All I Want for Christmas. When I saw there was a 'remix' of the song on here, I was concerned that the album was going to depend on the familiar hit to gain any attention. As for the remix, it isn't overly remixed and the changes are charming, but what stands out is the orchestral intro to the song--it's phenomenal and essentially takes Mariah's song and gives it a Carpenters' Christmas touch. It truly would fit in as an interlude between songs on one of the Carpenters' Christmas albums.<br /><br />But getting past the tried and true, As with her first album, sure she covers some standards, but the real treasures here are some of the originals. Oh Santa may not be as classic as All I Want for Christmas, but I think it's going to definitely become a staple of the season because it is incredibly catchy. Other unique Christmas songs include Christmas Time is in the Air Again, When Christmas Comes and One Child, but I'm particularly drawn to a couple of uptempo, contemporary takes on old favorites. Here Comes Santa Claus is infectious in this adaptation with a funky hip hop groove, and Auld Lang Syne gets an all out club vibe--I really hope this song gets remixed into a traditional 10 minute Mariah club track (as they did with Joy to the World from her first Christmas album). It's also fun that Mariah took on the Charlie Brown Christmas theme. The only track I didn't find necessary here is the live version of Oh Holy Night. If I'm going to listen to the song, I'll listen to the original studio version from the first album.<br /><br />One last thing, what makes this album extra special is that Mariah has actually brought back some of the background vocalists from the first Christmas album, which really helps capture the feel of the first album because the vocals are very distinct.
0441013597|1.0|I read the whole book, and only for brief periods of time did I find it the least bit interesting. I don't know how it won a Hugo Award, or how it is considered to be a \\"classic.\\" It's a sci-fi/fantasy book that doesn't bother to ever create a visual picture of the world. It is extremely dialogue-heavy and the dialogue reads like a poor movie script, where people talk in ways that no person ever does. There is an overwhelming amount of made-up terms that deal with the mythology/religion/culture/philosophy of the Dune world, but it's incredibly painstaking to look up all the different terms every time a new nonsense word pops up.     I'll admit that some of my rating comes down to personal taste. I always reserve one star for my personal preference...but even so, this book is only for really, really, really big fans of obscure sci-if/fantasy...and masochists.    Mind you, I love sci-fi and fantasy - they are about the only fiction genres that I read on a regular basis. I mostly read non-fiction books of every genre and difficulty. I am an avid reader, though, so this review does not come out of ignorance on my part.
1439133948|5.0|I loved this book.  I thought Miles was returned to form.  It was fast-paced.  It brought up realistic issues of problems that might occur in the future.  I liked the new characters introduced.  The ending, the aftermaths, was a little shocking.  I hope those \\"drabbles\\" are not all we're going to get.  I really hope she explores what happens in another book.  When I finished, I went and reread the entire series again, starting with Shards of Honor. Can't wait for the next book.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I've had this dvd for a long time now but avoided using it, mostly because it is INTENSE and because it hurts my knees. Yes it works in the sense that your muscles will feel sore the next day and be like that for days. I've never had bad knees and I'm in my 20s and 110 lbs but all the jumping up and down from the floor doesn't feel right for my knees. I wore proper sports shoes and tried to keep form, but it felt like something popped out of place and didn't go back to normal for a while. I think I'll stick to cycling from now on...
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is truly profound in it's themes, and it's beautifully intricate storyline.I'd reccomend it to anyone. it's just simply awe inspiring, and i felt the same profoundly deep feeling in the pit of my stomach as i do when i have just gone through something truly significant. This movie will move your emotions , and leave you near salivating at it's beauty by the end. Buy this film , and support it's prodigy of a director who has made numerous things of just a high calibur as this.Seriously, if you don't believe me look up any of his other work , and see the accolades pile up. He's mastered the art of playing with his viewers emotions thats for sure , and this movie just displays the legitamancy of his skill even more. Overall though i can't reccomend it enough, it's hard to convey the way this story WILL move you scene by scene in this sloppy written paragraph ,or even with words itself. But believe me, it will be worth your 3 hours and much much much more.
B00498YZH8|4.0|I liked the movie.  I thought it was well written and acted.  There was a lot of awkward silence in it for me and I thought it could use a little more character development.  Overall, still worth watching.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I thought this Album nailed it, every track on this CD deserves to be it's own rock n roll anthem. Tracks 2 & 8 are real party starters. You can listen to this album back to back with out getting tired of it and it definitely deserves a 5 Star rating. ROCK ON NICKELBACK!

B003TML0VO|2.0|The title is misleading, the songs poorly selected, the playing lacks inspiration. Hopefully this is the end of the Supernatural format. Supernatural was strong and things have been downhill from there.  Listen to the tracks and download a couple - but don't waste you dime for the full CD.  Yes - While My Guitar Gently Weeps is a MUST for your collection; you may find Back in Black interesting. Ain't Superstitious is also fairly strong (no guitar credits noted for Lang? vocals only?).  There are good songs, but many lack inspiration and the guitar licks sound recycled.  Think about it, \\"The greatest guitar classics...\\" I'm a Doors fan too but when did Riders on the Storm become and guitar classic? and why invite THE original keyboardist and push him to the back of the mix? How about Photograph. Maybe the best version of this song I have heard, but so what? This isn't Guitar Heaven. And a singer who tries to tribute David Lee Roths sound on Dance the Night Away...Why Carlos? Why?  Two stars is generous and reflects the scale for this artist. Carlos and the Santana Band are my heros, this fails to reflect their greatness. Maybe it was a fun night of Karaoke for them?
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this backpack in a lightning deal, so it was a little cheaper. Despite being more compact than my regular backpack, because this Amazon backpack has padded dividers in the bag, it is a lot easier to stuff delicate electronics gear in it without worrying about them knocking among themselves while moving around. I have a full size DSLR, a premium (i.e. larger) compact digital camera, and two camcorders all fitted inside this backpack and still have room for a few more things. The only thing I like to see improvement on is in the design of the zipper pullers. I have the need to lock the two zipper pullers together sometimes, so it would be nice if there are holes in the zipper pullers to allow a smaller padlock to go through. Other than this, I deem this bag an excellent backpack for cameras and small electronics.
B004132I20|5.0|Wonderful new series, Sherlock Holmes in the modern age. Absolutely loved it. Looking forward to series two.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Freddie Kruger doesn't scare me.  Neither does Jason Voorhees or any of the other boogiemen that populate the Cineplex.  Sure they can make me jump once or twice, but they do not haunt my dreams long after the movie has ended.  What scares me is something that could actually happen.  Thankfully I do not ski because Frozen would have kept me off any chairlift for the foreseeable future.    The plot is simple, three friends sneak their way on a chairlift one more time to get another run in before the mountain shuts down only for them to get stuck halfway up the mountain when no one realizes they are still on it.  Making matters worse it is Sunday and the slopes do not reopen until Friday.  Then the movie asks, \\"What would you do?\\"    The movie has some slow spot and surprisingly most of them do not come on the chairlift that makes up eighty percent of the movie.  What Frozen does a good job with if feeling the same fear that those three on the lift are feeling especially as they mull over their decisions, each more dangerous that the previous one.  Much of this comes from some excellent casting, most notably Emma Bell who was a great find.  If you are a fan of the horror / suspense genre, Frozen is a must see, unless of course you plan on going skiing ever again.    The DVD also comes with a few interesting behind the scenes featurettes that shows that yes, this movie was film on location at a real ski resort during winter, and that the actors were really up there without an aid of green screen.  One of the featurettes even gives you a weather report for each day of filming just to show how cold it got.
0240808452|5.0|Excellent resource for learning how to 'love' the human form, in spite of any drawing inexperience.  Personally, I'm uncomfortable with life drawing classes, and this book helps me to appreciate force and form without seeing people in the nude (NOTE: this is not motivated by censorship! Life drawing classes are CRITICAL to the developing artist. It's a personal psychological 'hangup').  It certainly does not replace the need for life drawing, but helps me to glean similar information from more mundane human activities, after studying the book.  With poetic rhythm, the author illustrates how to use smooth, confident line to capture the essence of the figure in motion.  Yes, I look at the sketches with great jealousy at how 'easy' it all looks, but I still feel this text gives me the tools to become more aware of the physics around me, in order to embrace them and then translate that into my animation.
B003DFJW9E|4.0|It's not the best of Hans Zimmer but this soundtrack is still pretty good. Right off the bat, the soundtrack starts off with a very fun and engaging tune for what will be the movie's overall theme. The music in general is quite cheery and fitted with a various number of different instruments. Not only does it reflect the film's comic air but also shows the craziness that is in Sherlock Holmes's head.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|One knows you're reading a good book when you find yourself transported to that time period and when you aren't reading, you are thinking about the characters and their lives, feelings, etc.<br /><br />The perspective of the main character grew with her age. However, there were times in her adulthood that her thoughts remained young and to lend authenticity to the main character's characteristics; enslaved.<br /><br />I was pleased with the ending because there were so many ways it could've gone, but the ending was a realistic relief after so much strife. As noted, I highly recommend this book to curl up and enjoy.
B003EYVXXW|1.0|Not an original idea in this movie.  The acting is so stilted that I couldn't make it through halfway.    I have always thought Weiz was an overrated actress.  She didn't disappoint in Agora: bad.
B00386EZJU|5.0|With such a great film, I did not expect anything less from the soundtrack. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. It fits very well with the mood of the story. The music is energetic and epic. It reflects the speed of the dragons in flight and really gives you the feeling that you yourself is also flying on the back of a dragon. By all means, the music has added an all new level of fun to the film. My favorite song is \\"Test Drive\\". Powell is a great composer and I'm looking forward to listening to more of his creations.
0670034711|3.0|I really did love this book...until the Bali chapter. It was at this point that Ms Gilbert criticised Western expatriates for 'running away from their responsibilities'. Hello? Isn't this what Ms Gilbert herself had in fact chosen to do? Is she not taking the moral high road? I admit, I am a Western expatriate woman 'of a certain age', living in SE Asia, and such stereotypes are extremely damaging (both outwardly and inwardly) to people such as me.  Anyway, as other reviewers have mentioned before,there are so many global issues that hold greater 'gravitas' than Elizabeth's histrionics about an (otherwise perfectly workable) Western marriage.

B001C4AFOY|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from this film; my expectations were pretty low, and I was pleasantly surprised. It follows Queen Victoria from her very sheltered upbringing, her teen years and the first few years of her reign. It's a fascinating portrayal of some of the absurdities of monarchy and its effect on the people who were born into it, and also its effect on, and interference in, politics. Like in \\"[[ASIN:B000RF7XYO Elizabeth]]\\", Victoria was young and inexperienced when she inherited the throne and had to learn the job through trial and error, losing her naiveté and growing into her role, although \\"Young Victoria\\" is more lightweight; she never has to become as cynical and ruthless as Elizabeth. For a while in the second half of the film it becomes a bit too much of a cute romance film for my taste but this doesn't detract too much from my enjoyment of \\"Young Victoria\\" as a whole. Recommended.
B00006ADD5|3.0|Well, I finally sat down to watch this movie and was expecting a great epic.  Great?  Hardly.  Mediocre at best.  Peter O'Toole's acting was so-so, in fact the whole movie was so-so.  And if they had removed those looooong \\"crossing the desert\\" scenes, which were so boring that the characters even kept falling asleep on their camels, the whole movie would have been under 90 minutes.  How much sand do we have to look at in three hours and 30 minutes???  Truthfully, I'm sorry I bought it.  Should have just watched in on Turner Classics, cause I'll never watch it again.  But at least now I can say I saw it.  WooHoo!

B00003CXA3|1.0|I purchased a DVD of The French Connection, a classic movie, to send to a friend of mine in the UK. Upon receiving it, my friend said it won't play on his set.    That it will play on only certain sets isn't noted on a DVD, of course. It should be. I now think even less of such manufactured products. In sum, what their producers need is to be tied to a stake and suffer a thorough thrashing with a heavy whip.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Awesome music from Paul. The songs are great, the singing fabulous and that bass is so melodic. I've been meaning to pick this CD up for some time being the huge McCartney fan I am and I finally got it. This one surprised me being that every song sounds so inspired. Yes, you can be old, but you can still make great new music.  I got the first Fireman CD years ago and I liked the experimental approach. This one is different in the sense that it is much more Beatle-ish in its approach. I agree with the one reviewer who said if the Beatles were still around today, this might be how they would sound. All McCartney and Beatle fans should get this!
0765326353|5.0|I've read pretty much every author out there for the genre, including some of his previous books, and this book is just amazing. This is the first time I have actually taken my time reading a book when i loved it because I just hate the thought of finishing it and not having any follow up. Only have 150 pages to go and while Im dreading it ending I just can't wait to see how it does.
B0045HCJT4|4.0|The fact so many critic's panned this sci-fi classic confirmed my belief most film critics DO NOT understand nor generally appreciate a quality sci-fi film. I also have to believe most film critics have never experienced how   actual, prolonged combat can re-configure how a human being will interact with society.  Combining great action sequences with the exploration of how a human being breed for war will experience being \\"thrown away\\" (as if that does not happen in our civilized society), this film is a real gem I've watch several times.  I consider it one of Kurt Russell's best performances.  The majority of Kurt's acting is done through his eyes and facial expressions.  No easy task for any actor.  And, that seeming \\"blank\\" look that Kurt uses as he sizes up situations and people?  That is a look I've seen before. It is very real.  It is how predators look at you, both human and animal, trying to decide if you are a threat, a victim or you just don't matter either way.  And, I will have to admit, I'm also a sucker for a \\"feel good\\" ending to an action film where the ending could have easily been ruined with melodrama.  'Soldier' is not for everyone.  Yes, 'Soldier' deals with complex issues simplisticly.  Yes, the film borrows from other sci-fi action films.  However, at least Soldier tries to deal with difficult issues and   where it borrows from other films, it does so very well.  'Soldier' a winner for those who appreciate a fun, interesting sci-fi film.  I know I added it to my collection.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|This is a kids' film, with rather grotesque vaudeville antics, cheesy life lessons, and an impossible plot.  Nonetheless, there is absolutely no question that this works.  From the first image of the buffoon Panda, I knew intuitively that I would enjoy this film in the way that a child's mind can:  suspending my disbelief and surrendering myself to the experience, no matter how ridiculous.<br /><br />Even though it checks all of the boxes:  ancient riddle wisdom, action acrobatics that are as mesmerizing as they are impossible, a deadly adversary that only the best can face, the destiny of dreams, and a training program for novices that transforms their lives both inside and outside.  Of course, there is the plucky neophyte, a most unlikely choice to join the greatest of warriors.  What's more, the established cadre does not want to accept the master's choice of the Panda, taking on a mission to reject and undermine him physically and psychologically.<br /><br />The uberbad guy escapes and comes to claim his mantle as master.  Meanwhile, the Panda takes his training in spite of the challenges, proving his character for the coming battle.  The process is fun to watch and you believe it.  The buildup in tension is good and there is plenty of comic relief, even in decisive battles.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is great family entertainment.
B003XMXZCW|5.0|This a review of Blue Ray version     Simply AMAZING!! like looking out a window of time as the movie unfolds and watching it happen right before you .. I have owned this since the VCR came out, I thought I had the ultimate on Laser Disk .. the DVD's were ok but the blue ray is amazing .. like seeing the movie for the first time .. everything is so clean and clear .. the sound, the sound envelopes you .. the colors mesmerizes you .. we all know the story .. get this Blue Ray to really show off your system .. go, no run out and get it or order it ..    What got me was this one item off the laser disk version sound track that the dvd lacked .. when they are about to throw out the Death Cards, Devall slaps the card pack to open it in his hand .. at that moment, BOOM is heard .. the laser discs had it but the dvd versions lacked that punch .. this movie punches you in the gut all thru it now
B000056HE9|5.0|Christmas is so hard with all of the family strain, making sure you get the right gifts and always feeling like you never do. Decorating and baking... This movie helps me to remember what it's all really about. Wonderful movie.  Dudley says you need to be careful, you never know when you'll meet an Angel unaware.  I always try to remember that when rushing past someone who all they might need is a smile and a hello how are you.
B00003CX97|5.0|This movie is the extremely accurate rendition of the incredible heroics of the brave men in Japanese prison camps that were made to build railroads. Many of these men after surviving battle on ships, ship sinkings, environmental and weather elements, were then subjected to cruel and inhuman treatment of Japanese soldiers. This movie is an accurate portrayal of these conditions with a few exceptions: (1) They did not whistle when entering the camp(although they did march in military formation, even when captured). (2) In the movie, Cdr. Shears tells the story of how he was on the USS Houston at the time she was sunk ,and how he and a Commander was seperated from everyone else and drifted to the other side of the island. The commander died and he took his rank...etc. In real life, there was a USS Houston that was sunk and there was a Commander Maer that did drift to the other side of the island with a Seaman Elam ,which is consistant with Cdr. Shears story of the Houston sinking. However, both Cdr. Maer and Seaman Elam survived amd were captured.(3) Real conditions of the prison camps were far more deplorable than depicted ,as well as the work details.(Men that couldnt walk were put on stretchers and given a hammer to bust up rock etc). (4) There were more American POWS than depicted in the movie, (the British often referred to the Americans as \\"Rabble\\"). and (5) They did not blow up the Bridge in the end and Col Nicholson certainly didnt turn on his own people to attempt to keep the bridge from blowing up.  Still an awesome movie that is a must see.

B002VPE1OS|5.0|My iPhone 3GS's screen protector has suffered months of (light) abuse and it was time to replace it. Fortunately, Amazon offers three for less than $2 plus free Prime 2-day shipping. If you've never applied a screen protector to your phone before, it can be a little tricky. That's why I recommend buying at least two in case you mess up on the first one. I find Amazon's screen protector to be \\"bubble minimal\\". I slowly *roll* the screen protector on, starting from the push button side, squeezing air bubbles out in the process. MAKE SURE YOUR SCREEN IS CLEAN! Use the included lint-free cloth. Lint creates air bubbles. The end result is pretty nice. A sleek matte, 99% bubble-free surface. Kudos for Amazon for creating a great, but super affordable product!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|My son has watched this daily since it's release date! He's playing with his Buzz Lightyear toy again and is for sure going to burn through another set of batteries! He's even taking it to bed with him! The movie is truly awesome. The creators obviously added new features to each and every character since TS2, probably mostly due to the increased quality Blu-ray delivers. It is well worth the purchase!
B001P36OY2|4.0|You can't go into this with high expectations. It's a Vin Diesel, cyberpunk action flick. It's got action, a decent plot, straightforward characters, and a bit of substance, especially at the end.  You want art, angst, or profound nihilism, look elsewhere. Loosen up, rent it, sit back and enjoy your popcorn. It's worth the price of admission.
B002ZG99G8|4.0|- Jensen (facing off against three armed security guards): \\"As the ancient Tibetan philosophy states, 'Don't start none... won't be none.'\\"<br /><br />When a covert Special Forces op in Bolivia goes horribly south and they get framed for the murder of 25 Bolivian children, the Losers go rogue. Of course, it simplifies things that they're believed to be deceased. Languishing in Bolivia, destitute in Bolivia, the Losers run into the stunning Aisha, and she's their ticket back to stateside and also the means to achieve get-back on the bent CIA spook who set them up (the degenerate's name is \\"Max\\"). \\"Suicide mission\\" just might be understating things.<br /><br />Comparisons to THE A-TEAM are inevitable (especially with THE A-TEAM remake coming out the same year), so I thought I'd mention that and be done with it. THE LOSERS is based on a comic book series off DC Comics' Vertigo line, which meant that it was a bit more edgy than your typical DC stuff. (Or maybe what I meant was that it didn't cater to the normal superhero sensibilities.) This story is adapted from the comic book's first arc \\"Ante Up,\\" which I barely recollect except that the cast does such a good job that I'm sort of compelled to unearth my old LOSERS comic books and re-read.<br /><br />It really is all about the cast. The story works off that run-of-the-mill \\"Let's Get Payback On That Bad Guy What Done Set Us Up\\" theme. It's shallow storytelling and stocked with plot reverses and double crosses, with snappy edits and hi-octane, over-the-top action sequences. The shifts in locales come with blurring speed, the story definitely globe trots, and so there's a bit of that disorienting factor for the viewer (or maybe the story convolutes that much). But the cast fuels the story, stamps it with a sense of cool, crackles it with energy. The cast is entirely compatible with their just-us-guys camaraderie (which Saldana then folds herself into). Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the team's leader Colonel Clay exhibits a world-weariness, and I don't know if he achieves that thru acting or because he's stubbled for the entire film, but it works. The charismatic Idris Elba is Roque, the second-in-command, and he becomes the catalyst for one of the film's sub-plots. Roque calls Clay's leadership skills into question. Things go downhill when Aisha shows up because Clay has had this history for having the most suspect taste in relationships with da ladies.<br /><br />Of all the folks here, the most highly profiled are Zoe Saldana and Chris Evans, and they get meaty roles. Zoe Saldana is talented and exudes the hotness of a thousand exploding suns. She plays Aisha, the volatile, assskicking operative who hooks up with the Losers because they share the same agenda (which is ruining Max's day, shortening Max's life). I thought Chris Evans was fantastic and often funny as Jensen, the Losers' resident wise-cracking comms & tech expert. Evans without a doubt garners the most dialogue; his patter is non-stop. His T-shirts are ridiculous. He faithfully roots for his little niece's soccer team, the Petunias. I particularly love his use of Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" and then his telekinetic bit. Awesome.<br /><br />We all know a good villain elevates the film. Sometimes I'm not sure what constitutes a good villain. The film's Big Bad, Max, is one of those sorts who doesn't really lift a finger, doesn't get his hands dirty. But Jason Patric plays Max in such a wicked condescending way that he steals pretty much all the scenes, especially when sharing those scenes with the stiff Holt McCallany (who plays his right hand man, Wade). Maybe a villain is validated by how much you want him to get what's coming to him. I really wanted Max to get his. It's a little show tune to describe Patric's performance as \\"delicious,\\" but what the ef. Call it as you see it.<br /><br />Not that the film spends too much time dwelling on it, but I think Max's destructive weapon of the day may have been something calleda sonic dematerializer. His scheme revolves around instigating a hi-tech global war. Max is a tool.<br /><br />Maybe my strongest quibble is that Holt McCallany's Wade doesn't really demonstrate why he's got this rep as a bad mofo. There's a good bit about Max ordering him to hire an eighteen-man kill squad but then Max changes his mind and orders Wade to kill the kill squad.<br /><br />- Max: \\"What's the matter? You related to them?\\"<br />- Wade: \\"Actually, one of them, yeah.\\"<br />- Max: \\"Really. By blood?\\"<br />- Wade: \\"A brother-in-law. I said I'd kill him.\\"<br /><br />That pretty much sums up Wade's big badasss moment. The rest of the time, he just stands around, not living up to his street cred.<br /><br />This is a cool movie, flashy and frenetic and snappy banter-full. It might even be worth purchasing. Stay for the end credits as Jensen and his Loser mates attend his little niece's soccer game.a sonic dematerializer. His scheme revolves around instigating a hi-tech global war.

B0006AAS5G|4.0|I purchased this watch as a keeper.  I wear it all of the time and it is the best at keeping time.  I had to replace the battery 1 month after I bought it.  Since battery replacement, it has kept great time......down to the second.  Invicta is a great time keeper and that is why I bought it.  Problem is the ink has come off of the bezel.... but don't let that chase you away..... it is a great watch.  I chop wood, fight crime and swim underwater with it..... I can count on it and rely on it.
B003JTHESA|4.0|THE BAND: Steve Harris (bass/keyboards), Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Dave Murray (guitar), Adrian Smith (guitar), Nicko McBrain (drums), Janick Gers (guitar).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2010) 10 tracks clocking in at approximately 76 minutes. The disc contains a 14-page booklet with alien and space artwork, 1 band photo, lyrics and thank you's. Recorded at Compass Point Studios (Nassau, Bahamas) and The Cave Studios (Malibu, CA). Steve Harris and Adrian Smith share a majority of the song writing credits. There is a double vinyl LP version as well as a \\"Mission Edition\\" disc - with bonus video, PC wallpaper/game, photos and tin case. This is the band's 15th studio album. Album artwork by Melvyn Grant (previous album covers include \\"Fear Of The Dark\\", \\"Virtual XI\\" and the live \\"Death On The Road\\").<br /><br />COMMENTS: I was pleased on first listen to Maiden's \\"The Final Frontier\\". It didn't hit me like \\"Brave New World\\" (2000), but I liked it better than their last 2 albums. For me, Iron Maiden has 3 distinct eras - the classic 80's, the lost 90's, and the resurgent 2000's. All ready, \\"Frontier\\" is my 2nd favorite album of the 2000's behind \\"Brave New World\\". The music is complex, multi-layered, and somewhat progressive. I think 10 years from now, this album will be looked on as one of the band's later era quintessential releases.<br /><br />THE GOOD: Glad to see the band went back to one of their old haunts in the Bahamas to record some of this. Compass Point Studios has produced some masterful material - AC/DC's \\"Back In Black\\", Maiden's \\"Piece Of Mind\\", \\"Powerslave\\", and \\"Somewhere In Time\\", and other albums by U2, The Talking Heads, Bob Marley, David Bowie, Eric Clapton and The Rolling Stones. The song writing is consistently strong. In fact, within some of these tracks, I'm thrown back to \\"Somewhere In Time\\". \\"Ed Dorado\\" is the albums 1st bonified hit - and rightly so... great song and groove. The title track is my early 2nd favorite despite its long and dreary intro. \\"Frontier\\" reached #4 on the Billboard Top 200 (August 2010) - the highest charting position for any Maiden album in the US. Rolling Stone Magazine gave it a good review as well. The quick paced \\"The Alchemist\\" reminds me of \\"Aces High\\", and I dig the complexity of \\"Starblind\\" (unlike any other song on the album). The combo of Smith and Murray on guitar is still strong decades later. Gers should have been given the boot years ago... minimal writing credits and is a 3rd axe really necessary (not to mention the band could be splitting their earnings 5 ways instead of 6).<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD: \\"Frontier\\" is a solid album. However, it's not without flaws. The song \\"Coming Home\\" is my least favorite of the bunch. I labor to get through this ballad of a track every time I spin the disc... the song drags and I find if pure drudgery to get through. The intro to the album opener (the tital track) is 4.5 minutes long... the intro is basically McBrain doing repetitions on the skins and Dickinson wailing. I find this maddening. In fact, I've gone through each song and listened to the often useless intros and outros and find about 18 minutes of wasted space. All I can say is... just get to the song!<br /><br />OVERALL: Strong song writing. Cool album artwork. \\"The Final Frontier\\" is a complete album and worth the purchase. Even in their 50's, Bruce still has the range and the band still sounds fresh.. and most importantly their music still kicks you in the teeth.

0151003084|5.0|A great mini-book by Edward Gorey filled with black humor adressing numerous children's death; seemingly limited but overwehlming.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|You've got to like the gritty, red-neck bumpkin dialogue in this movie, and the dirt poor landscapes of rusted-out cars and junk spewed across the yards.  Haven't seen a movie like this.  Great little heroine and redemptive outcome, paying the price for justice according to a hillbilly code.  Drug use and one semi-gorey scene.  Effective movie on its own terms.
0385732554|4.0|I think that The Giver is a very enjoyable book for young adults, and it is a great classroom tool because it covers so many important themes and ideas, such as growing up, questioning authority, making moral judgments, utopia, deceit, finding a sense of self, etc etc etc.  The story of Jonas' identity crisis and his realization of the lies that have been told to him are very rateable.  Young adults struggle with similar identity issues, and are coming to realize that their parents and teachers are not perfect or all-knowing.  Further, this is a great novel for helping students develop a societal awareness, and question the choices that are made without their knowledge or consent, whether on a home, school, local, or national level.  Basically, it's a great entryway to an exploration of many different themes.    The reactions of the students in my placement last semester were mixed.  While most of them enjoyed the story, they despised the open ending, wanting to know exactly what happened to Jonas and Gabe.  They were also shocked to find out that a woman wrote the novel (for most of the month, I guess they thought 'Lois' was actually 'Louis')!  Further, our central question was about utopia, and whether a perfect community could exist.  This was a fun topic for them to debate and they were able to create their own utopias at the end of the unit.  Overall, they had a positive experience with the novel.
0060763280|5.0|One of The best book I ever read . If you want to be financially secure read this book.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|The only way I can understand the extreme critisism of this movie, is that it comes from either folks who have never seen the series,or are not fans. Those who are fans and don't like it, just what are you expecting here?<br /><br />I found the story and the acting fun, I enjoyed myself throughly.<br /><br /> Although I am on record as opposing gay weddings, the one in the movie was enjoyable, I even liked the 2 \\"brooms\\" as they were called by Liza Minelli.<br /><br />I could understand Carries frustration with Big. A lot of women object to watching TV in the bedroom, and men who want to crash on the couch instead of going out. The other 3 womens situations were also highly believable.<br /><br />I thought the jokes and dialouge were exactly what normal and clever women would say,again I don't know what the critics were expecting.<br /><br />The trip to Arabia was great too. Don't believe the garbage about being offensive to Muslims. Such people who make those accusations, are annoyingly PC, and probably would have no problem if the same scences, were being directed at Christian Fundamentilists!<br /><br />I found the interactions between Carrie , her butler, and the man at the shoe market sensitive, and heartwarming.<br /><br />Best of all, is the conclusion of the film, it leaves you feelin good, and wanting more.<br /><br />So just ignore the critics who expected too much, or want to pin some kind of moral requirements on this film. See it, and you will have a very good time also.
0061537969|5.0|I wanted to read something different but never expected to be pulled in as emotionally as I was!!!   I was in tears the first chapter!!!  This was an experience that had me so emotionally involved that when I tried sharing the book with a friend, I started crying again!  This book was soooooo good!!! I am not a pet owner.  Actually I'm allergic.  As a kid, we had pets around the house and had several dogs.  This was a book I almost didn't put down until I had finished reading it.  I think I'm going to suggest it to the book club when my turn comes again.  I'm trying not to purchase books but instead borrow them from the library.  This is one book I am glad I purchased.
B002RKSXJG|5.0|I first heard of The Woman in White in two books that talked about the history of crime/mystery fiction.<br /><br />It was listed as a classic, and I'm pleased that it fills the bill.  I would call this a psychological thriller.  Collins is very good at writing in the style of the voices of the respective characters.  The various accounts fit nicely, and is an interesting way of telling a story.<br /><br />There are two female characters that you could argue have the \\"weaker species\\" problems, but they are made up for with some other stronger women.  Also, the Italians seem pretty sterotypical, but that isn't too shocking for the era.<br /><br />I was hit by two plot twists I didn't expect, and didn't get a plot twist that I did.<br /><br />It's quite remarkable that this was written in 1859.<br /><br />And this is one of the better Kindle books I have found for formatting.  If you go to the front, you can use the table of contents there to go to the various narratives. And it was free!  Highly recommend.
0792845684|5.0|No, this is not about divorcing some reality show girl named New York. This is one of the movies that stations like AMC, TBS, SpikeTV, and TNT LOOOVE because guys love it and will never get enough of it due to the sheer testosterone and guts of it. New York is now a prison colony and the U.S. President crash lands in it. Who gets him out? A prisoner named Snake Pliskin, now a government agent. Curt Russell's most memorable movie. He also played on Soldier, Tequila Sunrise, and many more. Easily recognizable stars on this movie like Isaac Hayes, Ernest Borgnine, Adrienne Barbeau, and Donald Pleasance with Lee Van Cleef thrown in for good measure. One of the best action/adventure movies ever made, period. Still gets high ratings on cable networks every time it airs. Highest possible recommendation!

A young child is found by the Jedi on Tattoine who is \\"very strong in the Force.\\" The Jedi want to train him as the \\"chosen one\\". But discipline is not one of young Anakin Skywalker's strong points, a thing that comes back in the later sequels to haunt(and kill) the Jedi. No spoiling the fun on my part any further. Some of the best sci-fi ever made. 'Nuff said.

B00000265Y|5.0|80's \\"Hair Metal\\" is how to describe this. Although too \\"synth\\" for some people, \\"Rock the Night\\" is EASILY one of the best top 40 metal anthems EVER. Fist pumpin' jam is more like it! I prefer other bands like Whitesnake in the \\"hair band\\" category but Europe is certainly a contender. For 80's top 40 metal, THIS IS IT. \\"Carrie\\", \\"Cherokee\\", \\"Final Countdown(played to this day as a stadium favorite!)\\", and others are included. May as well be their greatest hits collection. A collection must!

B003XKAZKO|1.0|I like Morrissey, and the Smiths, but enough of the reissues and endless compilations until  the labels get their act together.  This is another sorry reissue/compilation from him-obviously down the road  they'll reissue again this as a legit upgrade.  Morrissey and the labels know his fans will buy everything by him.  That's why we get the endless greatest hits compilations, he's getting  as bad as RCA/Elvis.    Seems the track record goes something like this:  studio album, compilation with a few b-sides to entice fans/studio/greatest hits/  studio/b sides comp/studio/best of/  It annoys me when it's obvious they are taking advantage of the fans.    Now this \\"upgrade\\" is total garbage. Now that it's the vogue thing to do, reissuing  and upgrading a cd, you can expect alot more of these from Morrissey.  The edits/cheap-flimsy packaging/expensive price make this a cd  to stay away from. You can get the original, and they both sound the same for that matter, for a couple  of bucks on Amazon.
B0041OOJNU|5.0|A lot has been said about this album, that it goes back to Pies Descalzos y Ladrones... etc! Honestly, I don't think this album has much similarities with those albums which are amazing. This album is excellent in its own way! A very complete album where different genres come together to make this a very good album. You have your merengue, that gives that hip to the disc...the joy, you have your rock that like always.. has that \\"Shakireno\\" style to it, and finally it has that special touch that only Shakira know how to put down: her \\"hardcore ballads.\\" After hearing Sale el Sol, I honestly have to say its one of her best works, to the point that it has become my second favorite album by Shakira (Ladrones is still up there :D).... but this album is excellent!

031603438X|5.0|I read Keith Richard's book in two days. Just couldn't put it down. It's a fantastic portrait of an artist, a genius musician, a heroin addict, a rock star, and a true iconoclast--as well as, of course, a history of the Stones. I'm not a musician so I didn't follow all the musical tips, of which there are many, but if I ever meet Keith I'd ask him where the beautiful chords of Gimme Shelter came from. (He'd probably say \\"open tuning.\\" I'd ask \\"What god or goddess?\\")<br /><br />OK, the only other comment I'd make--and this doesn't take away from the book--is this. It was fun to read the Mick Jagger information. He paints Mick in a bad light, and I'm sure that Mick, genius, icon, is the egomaniac Keith says he is. If I were Mick Jagger I'd be that way too. You sense on some level this is a shout out from Keith to Mick, partly out of anger and the feeling anyone would have after working with the same mug for forty five years. But also hoping Mick hears the message \\"You, of all people, shouldn't end up living in a bubble.\\" But here's the thing: in the book Keith gives a riveting portrait of himself as a heroin addict. Mick was his writing partner, band mate, best friend. Dealing with Keith in that state for 15 years or however long it was, well...how infuriating and alienating it must have been for Mick? Enough to make Mick go cold, surely. So there's definitely another side of the story... But that's the cool aspect of biography: subjective but real.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great one...

0316069485|4.0|This is the third book in the Micky Haller (Lincoln Lawyer) series, and like with the first sequel The Brass Verdict, Connelly has written his most successful character Harry Bosch into the plot.  Bosch however plays a lot larger word count roll in The Reversal than he did in the first sequel, if anything, he has more pages than Mickey Haller which may disappoint some fans wanting to read more of him in action.  Of course the one track fans who only want to read Bosch and nothing else will be disappointed that he doesn't dominate the book to the extent of his standalone novels, even though this is not one of them.  I didn't mind the percentages though, they worked for this story's plot.  The only thing I thought could have been better was the final chapters, the ending is pretty anti-climatic and leaves questions unanswered (although they may be in either the next Bosch or Haller sequel).  This can be read as a standalone novel, you don't need to have read the previous Haller or Bosch books to understand the plot or characters of this but it does give you a greater appreciation of them by having done so.<br /><br />Basic plot of The Reversal, is the defence lawyer Mickey Haller is approached by the LA County district attorney's office to switch from his usual side of that of the accused, to the prosecution.  A convicted child murderer Jason Jessup looks like he's about to be set free, not because he's done his time but because one of those we see the good in everyone organisations trying to set prisoners free has had a piece of evidence (dress from the murder victim) tested for his DNA and the DNA's found to belong to someone else. Not only is Jessup set to return to the community where he can abduct and kill again, but he's set to get a huge payout for being behind bars for 24 years, and become a celebrity.  That is unless the DA can get him retrialed and convicted a second time, for that they see an independent prosecutor as their best hope.  Haller accepts the challenge as long as his ex wife is on his team and Detective Harry Bosch is the lead police investigator.as long as his ex wife is on his team and Detective Harry Bosch is the lead police investigator.
B003JR1USM|5.0|This album is a very hard release to encapsulate in a brief two or three paragraph review this one. Indica are a group of five ladies who prior to this release had always sent out product that was sung in their native Finnish. Which probably limited their international appeal as it is apparently one of the harder European languages to master!<br /><br />What we have here is an unashamedly pop rock band which has decided to really focus, really attack their task at hand and to reach out to as wide an audience as possible. Every moment you are listening to this excellent piece of work you are figuratively nodding your head at the effort that has gone into making every turn of phrase as silky smooth as possible, how the feather-down-soft production values bring out each and every nuance of these beguiling tunes. The entire album blends together seamlessly and it also goes up and down the gears with consummate ease. The faster tunes such as Straight and Arrow clip along with the vocals of Jonsu being non gymnastic but very precise and charmingly phrased while other numbers wallow in lush misery - full lyrics are included in the booklet and bare this out. And the brooding and introspective facets of the lyrics also serve to anchor the album in more serious territory than would otherwise have been the case and belies the very teenage girl friendly merchandise slip enclosed with the booklet.<br /><br />Musically far mellower than much of my normal sonic diet this band is an intriguing blend of much of the lyrical sentiments of modern hard rock and metal as of 2010 but married to some of the most shameless pop sensibilities ever to have graced my stereo. Don't be fooled by the Nuclear Blast collection, this is way outside that labels normal sphere of operation, I guess in the 80's we would have called this sort of this power pop. But 80's power pop was never this cutting intellectually. Ditto for the Tuomas Holopainen connection (a co-write and some production chores) - there isn't an opera diva in site and while the atmospheric nature of this album can't be denied this is not symphonic metal.<br /><br />It's just a great album of lovely songs with soul and bite.a diva in site and while the atmospheric nature of this album can't be denied this is not symphonic metal.

0525951652|3.0|I was counting the days before this book came out and couldn't wait to read it.  If I reviewed this book before I finished it, I'd give it 5 stars. But when I hit 66% done, on my Kindle, it really hit the skids, in my opinion. The last third was way too detail oriented for me. Too much detail of the war itself, and the Bolshevic Revolution dragged on page after page. I was held captive by this book in the beginning but had a difficult time even finishing it, hence the 3 star rating.  As a side note, I'm glad I read it on my Kindle because of the book's size.

B001GWK2MC|2.0|This is my second Intex product from Amazon.  The first one lasted about 4 months.  This one, less than two months.  It is a lot of fun for my second kid (2yrs old) but is not durable at all.  I have two splits, both along seams so there's no way to fix it with a patch - it's not a tear, the seam weld just separates all along the line.  Would not recommend unless you're ok with spending money for a few months of fun followed by a big pile of deflated vinyl.
0714843377|3.0|Is this book a case of \\"style over substance\\"?<br /><br />The promise of the book is \\"to use the creative processes of good advertising as a metaphor for business practice\\".<br /><br />What you get is a nice collection of observations on business and life. Beautifully presented thanks to the efforts of Roger Kennedy but I'm afraid this book is a case of style over substance.<br /><br />The advice despite the creative angle is not particularly original or inspirational.  If you happen across a copy at a modest price by all means get it but if you are looking at a book shelf (virtual or real) chances are there will be a better book on the topic to the left or right
0971407614|5.0|I purchased this book about two weeks ago, thinking I would just add a few of the exercises to my current routine, like a lot of the other reviewers here. I thought it would be a better start for me, since I go to my university gym almost every day but am terrified of approaching the meat market that is the freeweight area.    Ohmygoodness. I love this book.     I haven't followed any of the ten-week plans, instead I choose exercises for a full-body workout every other day. I have worked muscles that nothing I have done in the gym has worked, and that most traditional gym exercises (squats, barbell curls) will not work. It reminded me of my trainer's words last year: \\"What good is it for someone to walk in and bench X pounds or leg press Y pounds, when s/he can't do anything with his/her own body weight?\\"    Bodyweight exercise is hardcore, and I would recommend this book to any sports athlete, dancer, runner, home exerciser, or gym rat. I feel that, regardless of the number on the weight machine, being able to use your own body weight is the truest test of strength and fitness there is.    I decided to challenge myself to use only bodyweight exercises (only cheating with a weighted medicine ball for sit ups) for the next four to six weeks and see whether I come out on top, which I'm sure I will.     If you're new to exercising, bored with what you're doing now, or just plain too busy to join a gym, try the exercises that have given some of our best and brightest the strength needed to defend us.

He had to have the sticks taped to his hands, according to his site. That broke my heart as I have severe nerve damage all over but like Phil I am still standing. From the Beginning of The Drums to The Unbelievable duet on Separate Lives what a voice she has. It is a 2 Disc set. I have watched daily since I got it last week I just love it.

0425152251|5.0|[No spoilers] This book is perfect for people who want an intro to philosophy or who are taking a college philosophy class and can't understand the jargon-filled, overly-complicated philosophy textbooks in college classes. Before reading this book, I thought that philosophy was rather boring. I also often wondered (rather facetiously) if philosophers and writers of philosophy textbooks competed among themselves to find the most abstruse manner to explain even the simplest concepts. This book made me not only understand simple as well as complex concepts but gave me great appreciation for philosophy. I initially read it to help me with a college philosophy class but found that it also helped me understand history and religion better. Not only that, but it is an incredibly interesting story in and of itself. An awesome book!

B000002KDG|5.0|\\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" is a fantastic live album from Neil Young, originally released in 1979. It is a live collection of all-new songs and is split into two sides, the first half being acoustic and the latter half being electric. The album even opens with an acoustic version of a song (\\"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\\") and ends with an epic electric variation of the same song with different lyrics (\\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\\"). Young's instrumental songwriting is top-notch on these tracks, but his lyrics and vocal melodies are some of the strongest and most poignant he has written. Seriously, the song \\"Thrasher\\" is amazing, one of his best ever songs if you ask me. I could and have just put it on repeat and listened to that one song over and over again, but it is just one song on an album of nine great ones. The acoustic songs will envelop you in beautiful, swirling chords and melodies, and the electric songs will hammer at you with chords so tough you'd swear Neil is recording straight heavy metal at times. You could put on any song on this album and be blown away by how beautiful and powerful Neil's writing, playing, and singing are, but in my opinion if you want to really listen to some magical songs, check out \\"Thrasher,\\" \\"Pocahontas,\\" \\"Powderfinger,\\" and \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black).\\" But whether you want to hear Young with an acoustic guitar singing, \\"My my, hey hey, rock and roll is here to stay. It's better to burn out than to fade away. My my, hey hey,\\" or hear Young backed by Crazy Horse singing, \\"Hey hey, my my, rock and roll can never die. There's more to the picture than meets the eye. Hey hey, my my,\\" you're sure to find something you love about this album.
B000VWOV3O|5.0|Why would anyone complain about the chance to purchase such innovative music at such a ridiculous price. As I remember it  - my old vinyl version of Between Nothingness and Eternity had very little in the way of liner notes etc - I bought it for the music - and that is what I have done in purchasing this 5 CD set. It might be no frills but to be honest, the frill and the thrill is in the amazing guitar work of Mahavishnu John McLaughlin and some stellar sidemen like Cobham and Hammer, Walden and Armstrong and of course the exceptional playing of first Jerry Goodman and later Jean-Luc Ponty. For me the energy of BN&E is unsurpassed but the beauty and power of APOCALYPSE is hard to beat. The group sets such a high standard for themselves that it is hard to find fault with any single CD. The level of musical excellence is maintained throughout. That being said I managed to purchase this box set for a few pennies over $2 per CD and that is a bargain in anybody's book. Check out the Weather Report collection and John McLaughin's solo stuff with Shakti etc for more aural excellence.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|The original book written in typical Ambrose style -- the father started it and his son finished after his death -- tackles the enormous theatre of battle in the Pacific during World War II, obviously through American eyes for the most part.  Like most Ambrose books, it's a compilation of vignettes of different service personnel who fought in various conflicts throughout the war.  Shockingly -- given their reputations -- you have to wonder if Hanks/Spielberg actually read the book before having the screen play developed.  Because \\"The Pacific\\" the miniseries might as well be a remake named \\"Band of Brothers II, How the Marines Won the Pacific War\\". There's no question that the Marines did one amazing job at a time when it seemed as if the Japanese were invincible and America barely had enough equipment and decent leadership to get into the fight -- early American military leaders were appallingly bad, simply attrocious and American losses were tragic in the early stages of the war.  Moreover, our service personnel not only had to overcome bad leadership, they also had to deal with massive interservice squabbling and egos and outrageously outdated tactics and equipment.  That said, while the Marines were key to winning the war, the book at least does what the miniseries never does: It spends some time describing the significant role played by our naval personnel, the Army and our Navy and Army pilots in winning the war (i.e. just exactly how did all those marine AND ARMY divisions actually get to those islands? and how did we manage to subdue one of the largest airforces in the world at the time?). With the book, there is some sense of scope and an acknowledgement that our victory in the Pacific was just as much a massive logistical feat as it was a victory of American boys from every walk of life and just about every ethnic background (except the interned Japanese Americans) over a highly trained, very seasoned adversary, that was better equiped in just about everyway, at least in the early stages of the conflict.  Instead the miniseries fixates on about four major island engagements and Hanks/Spielberg seem even more determined to turn this into a kind of \\"Hills Are Alive Meets Saving Private Ryan\\".  Bodies explode.  Skeletons are dug up, there's an amazing amount of blood and gore.  Yes it happened that way, but we are talking about a movie here so you if you know how to direct you can get the point across without exploding mellons, sausages and ketchup at every turn...  More to the point, as if duh, Hanks/Spielberg literally fixate on the copious amounts of sex that occured as young men about to leave home, perhaps for the last time, found women willing to give them a just send off -- we get it.  We know.  We just don't need all the gratuitous nudity and humping that goes with it.  In this regard, Hanks/Spielberg owe the Australians an apology for they way they are portrayed in the miniseries -- simply awful.  Moreover, you can't watch this movie with your kids, which is a real shame because the Pacific region was, is and will be a signficant part of the American story and the Ambrose family did a fairly diligent job of describing a piece of our history in the book.  But add the blood and guts to the sex and chunks of missing history and you've got nothing to do but continue to shield your children's eyes from one section of the miniseries to the next.  I'm almost tempted to send it back to Amazon and get my money back.  Whereas the book did a fair job on the subject the Hanks/Spielberg effort simply stinks.

B00005QENZ|3.0|On their 11th studio album released in 1993, Aerosmith gets use of what worked best on their previous albums, resulting in stadium rock of \\"Eat The Rich\\", \\"Walk On Down\\" and \\"Living On The Edge\\", heavy Rolling Stonish blues of \\"Flesh\\" and bitter-sweet ballads \\"Crying\\", \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Amazing\\". The sound is therefore excessively polished and offers very little room for experimentation, mostly limited with a loud eructation at the opening of \\"Get a Grip\\". This is definitely not the ground-breaking hard rock milestone but rather a predictable commercial rock very much in the style of Bon Jovi (rock trademark of the 90s?). While the powerful beat and roaring guitars may still keep you rocking, a more careful listen will make you want search for more when there is little to search for. \\"And how high can you fly with broken wings\\" sings Steven Tyler on the hit ballad \\"Amazing\\" and lyrically it feels like Aerosmith have indeed landed on this album. Except for \\"Amazing\\", the lyrics are pretty mediocre and lines like \\"sex is like a gun, you aim, you shoot, you run\\" are evident of a serious lyrical crisis Aerosmith suffered in early 90s. A solid collection of rock hits, but nothing close to outstanding should be expected. --Sain Alizada
0316098337|5.0|Is it just me?<br /><br />Am I the only one who sees this book as a sly, subversive feminist manifesto?<br /><br />Not that I don't agree with all the other people (including the Booker Prize nominating committee) who were gripped by the plot and impressed with the heroics of the utterly believable five year old narrator, \\"Jacker Jack.\\" But, thematically speaking, there is so much more to this book than just original characters and a suspenseful storyline.<br /><br />First off, it's no secret that the author wrote this book in reaction to learning about Josef Fritzl, that loony-tune in Austria who kept his daughter in an underground bunker for nineteen years. And, tragically, this sort of story is hardly unique in modern times. It seems as if men are threatened by the ever growing independence of women and these sorts of extreme measures are being resorted to by some incredibly sick individuals in an attempt to re-capture some idealized version of a traditional home life or to force women into subservient roles. Ma and her offspring (in this case, the sprightly, spirited Jack) stay home awaiting the arrival of Old Nick, \\"the man of the house,\\" each evening. He provides them with everything they need and, without him, they could not survive. And Ma's only role is to raise Jack and provide pleasure for Old Nick. It reads like an incredibly disturbing parody of a 1950's household.<br /><br />It's a shrewd perspective and, as told through Jack's guileless point-of-view, with all his adorable antics and quirky turns of phrase, an easy one to miss. Funny thing is, Donogue even suggests that Jack, in his own naïve way, might be exploiting Ma as well. Notice how he refers to genitalia using the proper words - penis and vagina, unlike most five year olds who resort to slang like wee-wee or pee-pee. Presumably, because he lives alone with his mother, outside of society, she felt no need to be coy when teaching him to speak. Why then, would the same child always refer to breast-feeding as \\"getting some\\" or \\"having some?\\" Many readers were understandably creeped out by the constant breast-feeding and, honestly, I think that was the author's intent. I mean, don't we usually hear men say they are \\"getting some\\" as a euphemism for sex?<br /><br />Just saying.<br /><br />And finally, in the second half of the book, Ma makes an indirect reference to Woolf's seminal feminist essay, A Room of One's Own, when explaining to Jack that she needs space from him. Again, no felicitous accident.<br /><br />In the last century, Virginia Woolf wrote A Room of One's Own, which argued for the equality of the sexes and E.M. Forster wrote A Room With A View about a young woman's escape from Victorian repression. And now, in that same spirit, we can add Emma Donoghue's masterful Room to that esteemed literary house.<br /><br />Brava.\\"having some?\\" Many readers were understandably creeped out by the constant breast-feeding and, honestly, I think that was the author's intent.

1594488843|5.0|Pink describes that the goal of this book is to bridge the gap between what science knows about motivation and what business does. He outlines the evolution of scientific theory regarding motivation from a focus on extrinsic motivation to one of intrinsic motivation. Using research from his previous book, A Whole New Mind, he ties that shift in theory to the change in the nature of work, that is, moving from more left-brain tasks to ones that require the use of the whole brain. Pink goes on to make his case for why external rewards backfire and lists seven deadly flaws of carrots and sticks, noting times when external rewards will be successful. Instead, Pink argues that the key to motivation is autonomy, mastery, and purpose. At the end of the book, Pink list a myriad of tips, best practices, and recommended books both for individuals and organizations.

B00007E8V4|4.0|Steal This Album! got critical acclaim from Allmusic, Entertainment Weekly, and Sputnikmusic and topped the Billboard 200 chart. I really enjoyed this CD. Most of the songs are fast-paced with a lot of drums. More than half of the album's songs are just as long as the songs used to be in the 1950's: short. Although Steal This Album! has political lyrics, the approach came off as being flippant at times.

B003UESJF6|5.0|Will Ferrell plays a genius supervillian named Megamind who ends up using his gifts for scandalous means after getting tired of being underappreciated and receiving the treatment of a social outcast. Brad Pitt plays his equally gifted rival Metro Man. Tina Fey plays a very energetic, vivacious, and upbeat woman named Roxanne that is very important to the character development of Megamind. The beautiful and uplifting message of the movie is that everyone has good in them. I also enjoy the message that seems to be tailored to both kids and adults that persistence can pay off even after multiple setbacks. There are plenty of scenes to make a person laugh. In addition, I like how the movie portrayed how a person that may seem like a villian on the outside is not always what they initially appear to be at the surface. In addition, the movie also sends a message that those that create mischief can many times be the ones that are yearning to be accepted and loved the most. All of the actors and actresses voiced their parts in a superb fashion. However, Will's Megamind character really helped to increase the humour and life into this great animated movie.  This is definitely one of the animated movies to see this month.
B0047SF41G|3.0|So, I gave the movie three stars. It was better than the two AVP movies, but not by much.    Rather than adding anything to the 'Predator' series, this movie was basically a remake of the original.  Yes, there are some small differences, but overall, its the same movie, 20 years later.    An appearance by Laurence Fishburne added Zero to the movie. Don't look for a 'Matrix'-worthy performance from  him in this movie. It just isn't there.
B002ZG99CM|4.0|When I heard they were remaking the Karate Kid I automatically hated the idea. The original is a classic that still holds up today and it didn't need a remake. Then when I heard it was produced by Will Smith and that his son was starring in it I hated it even more. Then when I heard it would be called \\"The Karate Kid\\" but be set in China where they do Kung Fu I REALLY hated it! But, I gave it a chance and watched it and I actually really loved it. All of the acting is great. I hate to say it but Jaden Smith is actually a pretty good actor. And his fight scenes all looked great. And Jackie Chan is just fantastic. This is one of the best roles he has ever played. All the fight choreography is brilliant. Much better than most American martial arts movies. And the cinematography of China is BEAUTIFUL!<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 out of 5 for a couple of reasons. 1) I think Jaden Smith was too young for the part. I think they should have waited a couple more years to do the film. It just wasn't very believable that an official tournament would let these older looking boys beat up on a 12 year old and nearly break his leg. Jaden should have been at least 14 before doing this. And 2) the movie should have been called \\"The Kung Fu Kid\\" NOT \\"Karate Kid\\" since they're not doing Karate. It makes no sense other than they just wanted to sell tickets. They could have called it \\"Kung Fu Kid\\" and still paid homage to \\"Karate Kid.\\" But those are the only two things that bothered me in this otherwise great movie.<br /><br />I can see this movie being just as special for kids today as the \\"Karate Kid\\" was for me when I was a child.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The son of a World War 2 US Navy fighter pilot, I grew up with the Pacific war always talked about amongst active-duty Navy pilots. After reading all the USMC books about the campaigns, and watching this amazing mini-series, I just have one thing to say: \\"Thankyou to all the young men who never came back, and the ones who did, and survived the post-war experiences with nightmares from<br />the war zones. If you find video games your only sense of combat reality, unplug the machines, take a deep breath and watch this with an open mind. Somehow, when the over-stimulated brain calms down and appreciates what these veterans have done, you'll finally GET IT.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|Sweet tiny design but don't let it fool you, it's a beast of an amp! I use this amp for my Grado SR225i and it works wonders out of those headphones, especially with the bass boost feature. It gives the lows just enough of that bass boost to be pleasing and not overwhelming yet with no discoloration to the mid's or hi's. I would certainly use it with the line out dock (LOD). For a while I just used the regular 3.5mm out on the iPhone to the amp and it provided very good resolution of my music. But when I finally got a LOD for this amp for my iPhone, it opened a whole new can of in our face crystal clear music. I was blasted away off my seat! Now be careful though, it shoots out music at a higher more powerful volume through the LOD then through the 3.5mm from the iPhone. So I would have headphones off till you set the appropriate volume level.<br /><br />Build quality on this is pretty durable with a metal casing. Similar to the iPod Mini from the early 2000's if you can remember those. I do not have much gripe with this product though. The only down side for me is that since I am using it with an iPhone it does pick up cellular interference and causes those \\"beep beep\\" and \\"eeeeer eerrrr\\" sounds from time to time.<br /><br />If you are looking for a super cheap and no way am I paying over $50 for an amp then this is product is great for you.
B003YY8KF6|5.0|I was never a big fan of Norah Jones until I became an adult. Now I can't get enough of her! And this CD is no exception. This has to be the most diverse cd she has ever made and it is the best in my opinion. Norah really outdid herself with this cd. This is a must buy for all Norah fans!
B00316DDWW|5.0|Being a loyal Porcupine Tree fan and having read that Karnivool opened for PT for several shows, I had to give these guys a listen. I liked the sound snippets I heard, so I bought Sound Awake. After the first listen I was completely indifferent. I could not tell whether I did or didn't care for the album. BUT, the second listen was like a revelation. That sounds a bit extreme, but it was like every note of every song was a new world opening up for me. This was a first of this kind of musical experience for me.<br /><br />Sound Awake is not the typical radio crap that is being pumped out from the recording industry like widgets in a factory. Karnivool weave together intricate musical themes into a tapestry of sound that penetrates your auditory senses and dances with your perceptions, all the while rewiring your neurons in ways nature never intended. Yeah, these guys are that good, and by good I mean ORIGINAL, artistic, and creative.<br /><br />When I look back on my experience of listening to Sound Awake for the first time, I think my brain was being reformatted, thus no immediate judgment of what I was listening to. Afterward, however, the magic happened, and I'm hooked on their sound. By the way: I don't use any type of mind-altering drugs, so this isn't just a bunch of psychedelic mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />I bought Themata after I knew I really liked these guys, but it is my opinion that Sound Awake is stronger overall. Themata, however, is definitely a solid album with songs and soundscapes that will loop in your mind for days (the title track is brilliant).<br /><br />So instead of reading another sentence from me, buy this album and give it several listens. I doubt you'll be disappointed.
B00406UK5A|4.0|Centurion is the latest gore soaked action flick from the man, Neil Marshall, who brought us Dog Soldiers, The Descent and Doomsday. It's no masterpiece, but I have to admit that it was extremely fun to watch, thanks to a good cast and some realistic fight scenes. It's very violent, but if you've seen Spartacus: Blood and Sand, this shouldn't even phase you. The plot revolves around a Roman legion that disappeared nearly 2,000 years ago while trying to destroy the Picts. This is what might have happened to the legendary 9th legion.<br /><br />I didn't think any of the performances were lacking. I found myself rooting for the Michael Fassbender's character by the end, and Dominic West, who I thought made a horrible villain in Punisher: War Zone, was actually convincing as a Roman general. Latest Bond girl, Olga Kurylenko, plays the  villainous mute warrior woman better than expected and looked good doing it. The locations are breathtaking, the score is decent, and the movie lacked the large amounts of cheesy dialogue I expected. That's a good thing.<br /><br />I didn't care for the CGI blood, but at least it was kept to a minimum. The story itself may not have been that original, but at only 93 minutes long, the film moved at a quick pace, though I would like to see an extended version.<br /><br />If you liked Gladiator, The 13th Warrior, or the latest take on the King Arthur legend, you'll definitely want to check this one out. It's basically those three movies rolled into one blood soaked package.
B00362DRQS|1.0|the recording engineer who mastered the discs is a joke why put this guy to remaster i have the original vinyl and cd of the first edition and is better only the dvd is rescatable   im buy this edtion with hight hopes and when im listen the sound is so bad why you remaster with bad architecture emi please remaster again the tape and call tu duran duran to give the ok   to sound bad for emi very bad for emi
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|This was a very boring DVD.  And, these gals are getting too old to do anymore of these movies.  Plus, the movie is spacy, not much substance and it's obvious that they made the movie just to earn money.  I wasted $20 bucks on this lemon.  Sex In the City 2 was one to many.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Not as good as Rated R or Songs For The Deaf but that is to be expected when you consider how good they are.  Has its moments but just doesn't quite put it all together as the aforementioned.  I know some will attribute the drop to the lineup change but I suspect it came down to very common problem with bands after a monster release, being rushed by the studio to capitalize on the increase in popularity.  I think some of the songs would not have made the cut or would have been improved with more time.  My recommendation is to download your favorites.
B001GKYBX0|5.0|This is a beautiful cd. I've read all the reviews and I just don't get the one star reviews. McCartney has had some missteps in his career but this isn't one of them. I love Paul and I think he's a genius but that's not why I'm giving this a five star review. I'm giving this five stars because it's a beautiful, wonderful cd.

0452295548|4.0|I bought this book after hearing the author being interviewed on Canadian Broadcasting Corportation radio.  The book is a deeply moving and edifying experience--more than just a book--it is truly a great experience.  I think all medical students should be required to read this book in order to connect with the humanity that resides in all of their patients.
B003YUC2FE|3.0|I was excited to see this set. I love all the movies and was eagerly awaiting all of the special features. I was really disappointed  in the packaging, a card board box with cheap form holding the discs in place. I would have rather had jewel cases, or some sort of folding packaging. The card board and foam really cheapen the look of the set. Great price for all the movies, but lousy packaging.
0312370849|5.0|I enjoyed the book a lot but knew I would. I like stories of WWII. This was historical fiction, but very well done.
B0001I55SS|4.0|While this movie suffers from the kitsch stylings and acting standard for Disney in the late 70s, it nonetheless remains a brilliant concept and a powerful story. Throughout the movie, the black hole itself provides a backdrop that gives the movie a sense of ominous foreboding. Maximilian Schell dominates the film as the insane doctor Doctor Hans Reinhardt. The movie has powerful themes, but as a Disney film is child friendly. For anyone who appreciates Sci Fi movies before the 1990s, this is a must see.
B0048IMZMG|1.0|First off, I'll start by saying that I've always liked Taylor. I thought her first album was fantastic and that she brought a fresh new sound to country music. However, her latest release... leaves something to be desired. If the song you decide to listen to isn't about how she got dumped, how she's in love, how she treated a boyfriend badly, or about how she's going to get her payback, then it's about how she doesn't want to grow up. Honestly, it sounds like Taylor needs some professional help. While I, like most people, like to occasionally hear about getting revenge, I also like feel-good music. Speak Now is seriously lacking in that. (See title track for example.) On a secondary note, while it was cute on the first couple albums, Taylor's musical range lacks. If you compare this album to the last two, you'll run into a lot songs that sound extremely similar. If you take the lyrics out of Innocent and Tied Together With A Smile ([[ASIN:B0014I4KH6 Taylor Swift]]), you'll find a lot of similarities note-wise. I'm not sure if her vocal range is just not that large, or if she really chooses to just not push herself, but it'd be nice to hear something out of her with a little more 'umph'. Overall, the album made me laugh more than anything. It also made me wonder about the sanity of her record label. Needless to say, I'll be a lot more hesitant about buying her next album.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  The new Russell Crowe 'Robin Hood' is actually a prequel. It tells the story of how the mythical outlaw became the great 'man of the people' BEFORE roaming around Sherwood Forest with his 'merry men'. Instead of being pitted against the Sheriff of Nottingham (who has a minor part here), Robin takes on Godfrey, a bald-headed bad guy and enforcer for King John who later betrays the homeland by allying himself with the French.<br /><br />  'Robin Hood' begins nicely with a finely costumed and gritty battle scene in France. Crowe plays Robin Longstride, an expert archer in King Richard the Lionheart's army. The King has just returned from the Third Crusade in the Holy Land when he is felled by an arrow during battle. It would have been nice if the film's scenarists had King Richard only speaking French since he never spoke English and spent most of his adult life in Europe, far from his native England. Longstride decides to return to England after he assumes the identity of a dying Knight, Robin Loxley, who has just been ambushed by Godfrey and his men. Longtsride promises the dying Loxley that he'll return the family sword to his father back in Nottingham.<br /><br />  Longstride returns Richard's crown to John and informs him of his death. John is promptly crowned the new King and is determined to tax the hell out of the Kingdom. In his view, Richard squandered the treasury by paying for all of intrigues on the Continent and his ill-considered campaign in the Holy Land. He reminds his mother during a bitter argument that at one point, England had to pay a ransom to save Richard after he had been kidnapped by the Duke of Austria in 1192.<br /><br />  With Longstride's appearance at the Court, I found it perplexing that none of the noblemen recognized that he was an imposer. After Longstride returns to Nottingham and accepts Sir Walter Loxley's proposal to impersonate his now deceased son, even more improbable is that no one in the town seems to be able to connect the dots and figure out that Longstride is not who he says he is.<br /><br />  The main problem with 'Robin Hood' is that Russell Crowe exudes little charm, playing the mischievous outlaw as a grim-faced action hero. As for his cohorts, Little John and Will Scarlett, they have little to do except get drunk and assist Robin and Friar Tuck as they steal grain, confiscated from the local population by Church authorities. This act wins Marion Loxley over to Robin after she initially is stunned when her father-in-law asks her to pretend that she's married to Longstride. Most of the forest scenes can be found in the Director's Cut which were wisely trimmed for the theatrical release. For those insist on watching the Director's Cut, you'll be treated to 1) Marion and a goat stuck in quicksand and both subsequently saved by Robin and 2) Marion saving Robin after he's kidnapped by local orphans dressed as forest-dwelling savages.<br /><br />  'Robin Hood' fares no better with its antagonists. The screenwriters come up with nothing to distinguish Godfrey from any of the typical bad guys found in any of today's films, whether they're based on real or fictional characters. And The Sheriff of Nottingham is even less likable than Godfrey with his constant lecherous advances towards the widow Marion. Only John is a little more nuanced as he vacillates in trying to appease the rebellious Northern Barons.<br /><br />  Finally, history takes a back seat to any kind of verisimilitude when the French invade England shortly after John's ascension to the throne. In reality, King Philip of France recaptured English-held territory in France and John promptly invaded that country. It was actually eighteen years later that France finally waged war in English territory. In addition, the signing of the Magna Carta and its disavowal by King John, also came years after as depicted here in this film.<br /><br />  Despite the convoluted chronologies, there is nothing wrong in attempting to depict Robin Hood in the context of his times. Except for blatantly anachronistic scenes such as when the French disembark from their warships in the style of a D-day invasion, I found the attention to period detail to be impressive. Nonetheless, without any charm emanating from the principal character, a lack of chemistry between the romantic leads, antagonists who show little complexity and glacial pacing in spots, the new 'Robin Hood' is at best, a lackluster affair.Robin Hood in the context of his times.

B002UJIY7A|4.0|Beautiful locations highlight this modern \\"whodunit\\". With a good cast and this kind of scenery, you can't go wrong. I like this movie a lot, but I figured out \\"whodunit\\" about 30 minutes in to the film.....although I wasn't completely sure for another 10 minutes, so it held my interest because the cast was fun to watch. It's not the best film of this nature, but it is certainly worth seeing. It's kinda like a thriller romance film! :-D
B002LVVCQM|5.0|The only people who will not like this book are those who do not care for good reasoning based on clear and undeniable evidence and who, in addition are sadly infected with that well-known virus of the mind called closed-minded religion, which depends for its suppositions on bronze age nonsense and blather rather than on reality.  Dr. Dawkins in this book presents a smashing good review of the evidence for the fact of evolution of living things.  He does so in a very detailed manner based on undeniable evidence.  If one wishes to know why evolution is true of reality, this work will well answer all questions.  Those who don't like it will do so for the usual specious and non-fact based reasons, which, it seems, are the only means religionists have for keeping their heads in the sand on the subject and for continuing to believe their unfounded myths.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I was leery about seeing this movie, even though I had read and heard rave reviews about it, because I had enjoyed the book so much.  And, needless to say, you hardly ever find a movie adaptation of a book that lives up to your expectations.  Well, in this case, the movie far bypassed my expectations and I would be hard-pressed to decide which I liked more - novel or movie.<br /><br />Casting is superb in the movie.  Setting is very true-to-life.  This is not an easy or fun movie to watch - the subject matter is too hard.  But if you want to see an authentic movie about the lives of hardscrabble people, most of whom are living on the fringes of the meth cooking, distributing and using subculture, this is a movie to watch.  It is also a movie about rising above your circumstances and shining, which Ree Dolly does, even though she has terrible obstacles placed in front of her.  So even though this is a very dark movie, it is not a hopeless movie.<br /><br />NOTE:  Marideth Sisco provides much of the music for the soundtrack of the movie.  If you like bluegrass music at all or just shining, clear vocals check out [[ASIN:B0041TM590 Winter's Bone Soundtrack]].<br /><br />Caution:  drug references, drug use, strong language, violent images<br /><br />Edited on December 23, 2010:<br />People magazine chose this movie as one of their top 10 movies for 2010 in their December 27th issue.  Well deserved!
B003Y7PML8|5.0|I have this album in CD and DVD-A formats, so when I heard Mofi was coming out with a new version on vinyl, I had to have it.  For those that know nothing about this album, it contains Sinatra with Count Basie and is nothing short of fantastic.<br /><br />While I still like the DVD-A with its surround sound format, I think this vinyl version is fanatastic.  The sound quality is top notch and the heavy vinyl is near silent.<br /><br />I do not have prior versions on vinyl, so I can't say how it compares.  But I have always prefered new albums to buying used because of it having less cracks and pops, so I have been waiting for a new remastered version.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|I have actually been stuck on ski lifts before - twice - so this hit a little close to home.  As I watched the movie I could vividly remember just how cold I was, especially on one of the lifts, and I was only on it for about two hours.  I don't know if you could actually live as long as these kids did in zero, sub-zero temps and blizzardy conditions but..<br /><br />All in all, this was a very well done movie.  The character studies were done very well and the interactions were very true to life - girlfriend, boyfriend, long time buddy of the boyfriend.<br /><br />It just goes to show you that you don't need huge budgets, major special effects or computer graphics, zombies, vampires or other kinds of make-believe monsters for a story to be scary.  Mother nature and human nature are scary enough!
B003SLE4DW|5.0|I loved the first 80% of the book, the build up is crazy!! Its what one reads a thriller for...but the last 20% is a drag. I really wish LC would end a book so nice with less violence and more mental triumph of good over evil!! I mean if good and evil use the same means to fight and win then a battle can go either way and its no fun as you feel good won just about...! See what I mean? No? Doesn't matter...read and enjoy anyway :-D
B002ZG98XW|5.0|I just loved this movie. My husband & I are regular movie goers and we have recommended this movie to everyone we come in contact with. I went through a variety of emotions,but most of all this horse had heart and touched mine... you are tempted to stand up and yell \\"You run Secretariat! Win for all of us who ever ran any kind of race!!\\" A gem of a movie. I will buy this one to watch over and over.
B0041OOEJY|4.0|By no means Academy Award bound but an enjoyable remake with a few changes. Enjoyed the location change to China an obvious upgrade from Reseda California. Overacting on the Mothers' part but thoroughly impressed with Jaden Smiths' performance. But then again comes from movie star stock, the beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith, and fresh prince Will Smith, so was not any big surprise in his ability to provide a stellar performance. Always enjoy Jackie Chan but only a teaser in this flick of his usual physical humorous stunts,acrobatics and signature antics. Actually think Pat Morita (Mr Miyagi) was a much more rounded and well developed character in the first. Never really cared much for Ralph Macchio and considered him the weak link in a great movie in the original version. He got lucky with a couple of great movie parts My Cousin Vinny and Karate Kid. Probably had a relative in the casting departments. This remake out shines the sequels by leaps and bounds and is close to if not equaling the original film.
0316098337|5.0|After finishing Room, the one word that keeps popping into my head is WOW.  I was originally off put not by the subject matter of the book but by the thought of reading over 300 pages told from the perspective of 5 year old Jack.  I am sure most 5 year olds are cute but not many are interesting enough to take me through a full book-until Jack.  The amazing part of Room is not the plot or a whole host of characters-it is simply the voice of Jack telling an incredible tale through his eyes.  Donoghue manages to create a voice for Jack that never strays from it's 5 year old but rivets the adult reader to each page.  The tale of being held hostage for years is one many are familiar with from the newspapers of late and a simple horror story would have been hard to read but predictable.  Here, Donoghue turns the tale on it's head so it is not familiar-it can't be-Jack's never heard of the other stories-he doesn't even know the outside exists.  I have been a fan of Emma Donoghue's since Slammerkin and her stories are so well written and the characters are each fully fleshed out with their own voices.  But in Room, Donoghue really shows she is becoming a master of her craft.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|An all time favorite that's been around for some time.  Great movie for everyone to have, for sure.  A must have!
B00406UK7S|5.0|I will never understand movie critics.  Every New York paper trounced this film when it was released grousing about Romans having British accents and attacking it as mindless entertainment.  Hey, every epic cannot be Stanley Kubrick's 'SPARTACUS\\" or Ridley Scott's 'GLADIATOR' but if you're looking for a rousing adventure film, look no further.  These critics should have stuck with the countless bathroom humor comedies and inane human dramas populating the theaters as of late and leave the action movie genre to the people who appreciate them.  Neil Marshall's latest film 'CENTURION' is a relentless experience from the first frame of film projected to the last and you would have to be a block of wood not to be effected by its intensity.  Based on a true story about the ninth Roman Legion which disappeared in Scotland in the realm of the Picts on their campaign of conquest, it shows the survivors struggling against the terrain and the cunning of the ultimate Pict tracker to get back home.  You've read the reviews contained within this release space in Amazon.com so I won't go on but I will tell you that the action is electrifying with the standout being Olga Kurylenko (QUANTUM OF SOLACE) in a malevolent performance as Etain, the voiceless Pict tracker who never stops her pursuit of the Roman survivors. The filmmakers pull no punches in the realism of the battle scenes and fight sequences , yes, heads are lopped off when they meet a sharp blade and body harm does occur when confronted with arrows,axes and fire so be prepared for a bloody time.  Marshall balances how we feel about both Roman and Pictish sides showing the futility of war and invading territories which should not be invaded, hell, he shows the Romans attacking their own men because they are wearing Pict clothing.  Comments on the acting of Michael Fassbinder and Dominic West as being passionless and wooden are as legion as the Romans but I think they are perfect showing the way they probably were, arrogantand honorable to their last breath. Magnolia Home Entertainment has released a crisp transfer with excellent 5.1 Dolby Digital EX which was beautifully separated on my sound system and contains a great audio commentary by the director and crew, deleted scenes which show why they were excised for they would have slowed the film down and five behind the scenes featurettes on the cast, locations, and cinematography.    Many may conceive this film as mindless eye candy but Director/Writer Neil Marshall has created and produced an intense, nerve wracking 98 minutes of celluloid and should be comfortable in knowing that 'CENTURION\\" is a cult classic ready to explode.
1439177783|5.0|Kudos to Mrs Degeneres for baring the torment of her body and soul for such a searingly intimate and honest portrait. Reading this book made me feel like I was there with her, a seemingly \\"has it all\\" actress, literally starving herself in a tragic obsession to fight nature, sexuality and her own body. By about mid-way through the book, I found myself saying \\"she has to 'bottom out right about now, right?\\"  I found my heart just breaking for what she (and likely dozens of other actresses and models) put themselves through to match society's idea of what makes a woman attractive. By the time Portia comes to terms with herself, embarks on her way towards healing and health and finds her soul mate it's the biggest relief!   I think that this book would be a great resource for anyone battling an eating disorder (or the parent of friend of someone who is). Likewise at a time when sexuality is front and center in our culture and gay teens are struggling so, this book ultimately offers the truth that yes, it does get better.
B000001K2V|5.0|I'd heard some fine recordings by Klien (e.g. the famous Beethoven sonatas), so I thought I'd give his Mozart sonatas a try.  I love them.  For me, they conjure up the image of Mozart as the lonely genius, sometimes happy, sad, powerful, gentle, playful, simple, complicated, all of which flows from Klien's playing.  By contrast, I've heard many other pianists just 'play' them, getting all the right notes in the right order but with few feelings coming over.  They do Mozart no favours.  Klien brings out the genius.  The price of the CDs is unimportant.
B0041T7FS6|4.0|Despite having the records and CDs, I saw that this box set contains some previously-unavailable material that made it irresistible for me.  Is it worth it to you?  Depends.    It provides a good overview of the hits.  It has a long version of Thornton's Soup For One track that actually is stronger than the album track we knew before, plus another groover from his unreleased lp of 82.  There is a new Chic track from the same year, apparently rejected from the Tongue In Chic album.  It would have made a strong initial single from that album.  There is a long version of Pendergrass' Soup For One track.  There are three of the 8 Mathis tracks that show how well Rodgers&Edwards were able to fit acoustic dance sounds to Mathis' crooning style.  There are three outtakes of Sheila B and Chic tracks absent strings or keybs that each end prematurely with blunders, and a fourth outtake that is really just studio joshing without conversation or playing.    Then there are the Dmitri remixes.  He takes the approach heard on so many remixes, anachronistic to these Chic tracks.  Sounding like one of the army of remixers on a 90s Madonna 11-track CD single, Dmitri resets the tempo, drum tracks, and arrangements. He uses fade-in,fade-out vocal tricks, long intros without rhythm track, restructured chorus and verse sequences.  In the case of \\"I Want Your Love,\\" the reworking is devastating to the intrumental balance.  \\"I Feel Your Love Comin' On\\" is deprived of its point, the sexual and sonic culmination of the chugging arrangement.  The Sledge remixes sound as mechanical as the ones on previous reworkings from the 80s and 90s.    I'm hoping if the label says \\"Vol 1,\\" the rest of the  unreleased material will be included on \\"Vol 2.\\"  There would certainly be adequate room if Rodgers keeps the material away from any remixers and just gives us the goods in Chic Org form.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|First let me say that this is a review of the entire series and not just the season. I will post this under every season so that everyone can see this review.  Now, in my opinion Lost is one of those once in a lifetime shows that will never come around again. Lost has a beginning and an ending, but to fully enjoy Lost you need to own and watch all of the seasons sequentially. They are all great seasons. While I do like some seasons better than others, I find them all an intricate piece of the overall puzzle that is Lost. In order my choices for seasons are:     Season 1  Season 2  Season 3  Season 5  Season 6  Season 4  I believe the writers strike really messed this season up.     *****Spoiler Alert *******    Lost is a story about a group of people who crash land on an island. They soon discover this is not just any island, there are \\"Others\\" living on the island. There are various life forms living there that should not be able to live there such as a smoke monster(explained in season six), a huge polar bear etc. The island has certain properties as well, such as women who become pregnant do not live to full term, there are also hatches on the island from a former group called \\"The Dharma Initiative.\\" These inhabitants were killed off by \\"The leader of The Others.\\" (Explained in season 3) When it becomes apparent that rescue is not coming to the survivors thing really start to heat up on the island. Eventually some of the survivors do manage to get off of the island (season 5) during which time the rest end up back in time (yes the island can move through time)and find a way to work in the Dharma Initiative. When those who had been off the island find a way back, all hell breaks loose. I won't tell you how it ends for a number of reasons, but I will say that I was very happy and disappointed in the ending. The ending had answered most of my questions satisfactorily only to leave me feeling a bit empty about the whole series.     *****End Spoiler Alert******  If you want to be hooked on a great series buy the whole series and enjoy. I personally could not watch each episode fast enough once I started. I found every excuse to watch show after show. I cannot remember the last time I had felt this way about a TV show. I only wish there had been more of Lost to watch.     Wasitchu.
0765326353|5.0|I don't usually read fantasy novels - but, I gave this one a shot because of the good reviews.  I got the audio version of this book (absolutely incredible narriators - but, in reading other reviews, I realize that there were pictures in the hardback - I might need to get the hardback too.)    This book grabbed my attention right away, the characters were extremely well developed, and the story line was engrossing.  I was upset at every major chapter change because I didn't want to leave the current story thread.  However, that usually only lasted a minute or two.    I found the interludes to be a little odd, but they did add to the overall story.    I'm most upset that I have to wait an entire year to read the next one in the series.

0525951652|4.0|.. Billy Williams went down the pit in Aberowen, South Wales.'<br /><br />The day was 22 June 1911, and Billy was 13 years old.<br /><br />Spanning the years from 1911 to 1924, this novel touches on events during this period in Europe, Russia and the USA as they impact on members of five families  from very different backgrounds.  These years encompass many of the tumultuous events of the early 20th century:  the events leading to the Great War; the war itself; the fight for women's suffrage; and the Bolshevik Revolution; as well as the opportunities seized by some as Prohibition takes hold in the USA.<br />Mr Follett brings this story to life through a multitude of characters interacting with each other, as well as with historical figures and events.  There are over 120 characters in this novel, with the central characters coming from Wales, England, Germany, Russia and the USA.  The central characters include an English earl, a Welsh coal mining family, some German aristocrats and a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; to the USA.<br /><br />This is the first novel in `The Century Trilogy'.  While the completed trilogy will follow the lives of characters through the twentieth century, this first novel establishes the key characters and follows their changes in fortune (for good and bad) until ending in the halls of the  British Parliament in January 1924, after an attempted revolution in Munich is quashed.<br />I enjoyed this novel.  At first I found the list of characters (at the front of the novel) quite daunting, but as the story unfolded I found that the characters and events complemented each other in a way which made the story easy to read and difficult to put down.  My main criticism is that some of the characters were more representative stereotypes than fully fledged characters but this did not impede the flow of events.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the second book in the trilogy.<br /><br />`We are the future.'<br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith

0553805371|5.0|I give this book five stars because Hawking--striving to outdo Einstein--and Mladinow--striving to outdo Spinoza--have created a new story of multi-dimensional mysterious universes that make scientists and mathematicians such as themselves the new rulers of modern society, re-establishing that supreme position among peers that Pythagoras had lost--he was killed, remember, by former colleagues when the existence of \\"irrational\\" numbers leaked out (we in academia understand this sort of weird revenge). The authors also indirectly discredit the great Immanuel Kant--he doesn't even rate a spot in the index--who held that some questions, such as those related to the soul or its immortality, are beyond scientific investigation and its tools of measurement. Hawking and Mladinow have a simple answer to Kant: nothing exists or is of any concern which is beyond scientific investigation. Any unobservable conjectures about the amazing, ten dimensional (plus time) M-model they propose that may not be testable by experiment are simply not part of reality, period.         And so we have a new book challenging and dethroning traditional scripture and myth, a book that now fully explains the serious \\"why\\" of existence and its laws, dethroning all opponents because of the high and near-immutable status that a modern, secular society assigns to these new story-tellers. It is not possible to prove them or their story wrong, except perhaps in alternate, equally probable universes where aliens--displacing traditional demons, I suppose--may lurk, waiting to harm us.          Should you read this book? Here's a simple test from the Acknowledgments, where it states: \\"Unlike the universe, a book does not appear spontaneously from nothing.\\" This normally would be considered a \\"cute\\" statement by the authors, but they are deadly serious. If the above statement somehow makes sense to you, then go pour some cool aid and enjoy the ride this book will provide. Leonard Mladinow, a fellow Chicagoan, perhaps will write a follow-on work on when the Cubs will win the World Series (or if such an event remains even possible)         As for me, I regret that Albert Camus is no longer here to revise his famous quote: \\"There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.\\" Since these new high priests of the secular world have declared that philosophy is dead, perhaps Camus would conclude that suicide may now enjoy a revival without excessive guilt or opposition.

0439023491|4.0|I didn't feel quite as passionate about this book as I did about The Hunger Games, but I think it's because the narrative was more of a transition between the initial competition and the full blown rebellion. I found Katniss's uncertainty about her love for Gale and her devotion to Peeta redundant, although it is this dilemma that is a driving force for the book.  The threat of an uprising in the District forces Peeta and Katniss to be contestants in another Game for the Quarter Quell, emphasizing the sinister role of the Capitol.  There are a number of new characters introduced, but I missed some of the more eccentric people I got to know in the first book like Katniss's stylist Cinna.  One great element of this book was the establishment of Katniss and her symbol of the mockingjay as the icon representing the rebellion.  Her personal defiance is the catalyst for unrest and dissatisfaction with the status quo defined by the Capitol.  I'm looking forward to the conclusion in the Mockingjay and hope it is as engaging as the first book in the series.
1439177783|5.0|I was vaguely familiar with actress Portia De Rossi from her roles on Ally McBeal and Arrested Development as well as her marriage to Ellen DeGeneres. I didn't pay her much attention until I watched her recent interview with Oprah. I was so moved by her story that I made an ugly cry that would make even Oprah herself give me the side eye. I went out and bought Unbearable Lightness the next day.<br /><br />The thing I liked the most about the book is how honest Portia is. Heartwrenchingly honest to the point that I almost felt like I was eavesdropping on something too personal to be shared. However, Portia did so in order to heal. It was tough at times to read how much this woman hated herself. For being gay and terrified of being outed. For being in a business that focuses squarely on what you're not. For never being good enough or thin enough even when she'd starved herself on a 300 calaries a day diet. You want to reach through the pages and tell her to stop the insanity and the self-torture.<br /><br />It's wonderful that Ellen came into her life and helped her to learn to like herself. They seem great for each other. Now that I've read her story, I really admire Portia and I wish her the best.

B00406UK7S|2.0|This is, actually, more a review of Larsen and Buchanan's reviews of this film than of the film itself (as I haven't seen it yet).    Like most Hollywood historical films (or films based on historical events) this film suffers from Hollywood's habit of playing fast and loose with historical fact (just as it did in the films \\"King Arthur\\", which is based on one theory that tale of King Arthur and Camelot was a Roman General serving in Roman Britain toward the end of Roman rule in Britain, and \\"The Lost Legion\\" which, like this film, involves the myth of the 9th Legion being wiped out in Britain.    It IS a myth that the 9th Hispana Legion was lost in Britain.  Like all myths, this myth is most likely based on a grain of truth.  That being that a contingent soldiers (called a \\"vexillation\\")of the 9th Legion, sent to defend the Roman city Golchestor (Camulodunum) during the revolt lead by Queen Boudica of the Iceni in 60 A.D.  Apparently it arrived too late to save the city and was wiped out by the rebels, with only contingent's calvary escaping to return to their base to the north.    The last known date of the 9th's presence in Britain comes from a roof tile dated to 108 A.D. bearing the 9th's stamp on it.  While the 9th may well have still been in Britain in 117 A.D., the film's setting, when Hadrian arrived to inspect the Roman province of Britain in 122 A.D. he brought with him the 6th Legion as a replacement for the 9th.  The 9th, apparently, having already been withdrawn to the continent just prior to Hadrian's arrival in Britain.  According to historical evidence the 9th spent some time in Holland (The Netherlands) before, according to some historians, ending up in Syria where it was indeed apparently wiped out in a war some years later.    Hadrian's wall was not, as stated in Buchanan's review, built \\"to keep the Picts out\\" though this was thought to be the case by historians as far back as the 600s.  Modern historians now believe the wall was built to control(and tax) the movement of people (along with their livestock and trade goods) north and south.  In fact, the Romans manning the Wall had to build defensive works behind (south of) the wall to protect their backs as the local British tribes immediately south of Hadrian's Wall had never been fully subjugated and therefore not to be trusted.    At any rate, being a stickler for historical accuracy, I'll wait until this film winds up in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart before buying it.  I recommend you do the same (in the meantime I'd still recommend \\"King Arthur\\".  Though it's unlikely the King Arthur legend derived from a folk memory of a Roman general, and the depiction of Hadrian's Wall in the film is unrealistic (it never looked that good even in real life!), it's still a good story and not as gory as this film is reported to be...
B000V5TV22|5.0|I purchased the BU-353 GPS receiver to use with the marine navigation software I installed on two different laptops used on my sailboat. One of the laptops runs Windows XP and the other, Windows 7(64bit). I installed the latest drivers from the manufactures website, then connected the gps receiver which has worked flawlessly on both computers and under both operating systems. The gps receiver is installed inside the boat and receives signals through the fiberglass without issue.
B003YUC2FE|2.0|It is fantastic to be able to get all three movies in one well prices collection but the packaging is just horrible.  Having all 10 disks just stuck into a foam block means that you can't take just one movie anywhere and you constantly have to pull and replace the disks trying to find the one you want. It is a shame to see such a wonderful and imaginative movie collection compromised by such bad design.

I think this film will gain a very solid following on home video . Perhaps not .

Lots of laughs , fun and quite singular .

B002JVWQT6|5.0|Modern family is a great television series that really has brought a lot of laughs into my household.  I'm not going to go into the a review of the show itself, as It's highly recommended.  Go check out youtube clips, rent an episode on Amazon Unbox or iTUnes and see for yourself.<br /><br />I want to comment on the the blu-ray packaging.  Anymore it's a little hard for me to watch SD movies, even with my PS3's great up scaling feature.  But, I'm usually more lenient with television because not everybody shoots in HD and television doesn't usually benefit as much from HD as an action flick.... Well, my views are now the opposite.<br /><br />Modern Family looks absolutely stunning in HD and sets a standard of how television shows should look and sound.  Modern Family takes what you expect to look mediocre (a show based primarily in three homes of a 'Modern Family') and really sets it apart from other action/drama shows I own on blu-ray (Vampire Diaries?).<br /><br />This package arrives on three discs which contain 24 episodes.  They are loaded with extra features on each disc that are shot in HD as well.  The outer package is a standard 3 disc blu-ray case with a slipcover.<br /><br />If your in debate on which format to buy this show on, then I'd say it's worth the extra couple dollars to make the purchase on blu-ray.

B0036EH3XE|4.0|Too bad they couldn't figure out a decent end.  Actually, not unlike other television shows that ran its course.  Still---not quite 5 stars because of it.  But c'mon, didn't we all think that was what was going on within the first 5 episodes of the first season?  The good vs. evil thing?  Heaven and hell?  Left and right?  You know what I mean.  I still had to complete my set.

B00402FGE4|5.0|I know a lot of folks are down on SGU because it replaced 'Atlantis' or because it has a 'BSG Wannabe' air about it. And I'm sorry that those folks just don't get it with SGU.    It's about atmosphere and it's about drama, and it's about characters. Like a novel for TV, it unfolds slowly, soaking you in the Universe (sic) that the authors are creating. The cast is top notch, the photography is beautiful, the intensity superb.     I love this show.    And on Blu-Ray it's simply beautiful. If you want something with a longer narrative than traditional Stargate, with a sense of genuine wonder often missing from TV sci-fi, then SGU is for you. Be prepared to invest a little time, and you'll receive something a little special.    Also, major +1 to how the Stargate shows (and particularly Universe) portray the military. Not goons or jar heads, but real people with real flaws who despite those flaws put themselves into harms way so that we can have a better life.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|I loved this show when it first came out and watched it faithfully for the whole time.  It is nice to have almost all of the episodes available to watch at my leisure.  In these times when the broadcast media seems to be focussed on the shocking or reality-based drama, I can go watch the highest quality show (arguably) ever produced.    My only issue is that some of the disks do have bad spots, but nothing more than a few seconds.  Next is that one of the disks is missing.  I did not look through all of the packaging until right away.  Disk 3 of season one is not included.  I am reluctant to send the whole package back.    Anyway, it is still worth the money if you are any kind of a fan at all.    Enjoy.

0316776963|4.0|After years and years of dumbfounded stares when I mention I haven't read Sedaris, I decided I'd better give him a chance. I think I steered myself awy from Sedaris because I'm typically not a fan of funny books (if only because I rarely find them funny). Sedaris has proved an exception, and I kept thinking about Twain as chuckled my way to the finish. There is a similarity, at least insofar as Sedaris has a similar biting wit that may prove to transcend generations like Twain -- although I don't feel as though Sedaris is as good a writer.<br /><br />But yeah, lots of good stuff. Stuff I could relate to. Stuff that makes me want to see Sedaris on another one of his book tours. He's got a new book out. Something about chipmunks. I'll have to check it out.

0553381687|3.0|This book was beautifully written and so were the next three in the series.  There are some tedious parts, and it is very dark.  I thought the human suffering went a little far at times, particularly one scene where a child is tortured as the mother watches helplessly. However, he is undeniably a very talented writer.  My problem is that after investing so much time in the charactors of this book it leaves off with a cliff hanger on the third book. The forth book never resolves anything but instead introduces new charactors.  Its been 5 years and still no resolution to the cliff hanger.  I'm not saying don't read this book but if I had to do it all over again, I would wait until the conclusion was written and then dig in.
B003PIUC02|5.0|This is simply an awesome series. A very well written script and plot. Filled with intensity and excitements. You'll be caught by surprise in many aspects of the movie. It is worth your time and money. Bravo I must say. Brillant acting especially the character \\"Dominus\\". It's all about the reason for survival. Is it about love or fame and glory or fortune and station or just simply blood and sand ? Judge for yourself after watching. Am sure you'll enjoy every bit.
0375842209|5.0|Narrated by Death, this book started out differently than anything I've ever read before, and I found it a little off-putting.  But once I got past that I couldn't put it down; it was a wonderful, inspiring story. Leisel, the book thief who discovers the value of books as an escape, is a survivor. Life throws one horror after another at her, and each time she recovers choosing life, without a trace of self-pity. That's what I enjoyed most--while the terrors of Nazi Germany are ever present throughout the story, it's the resiliency of the human spirit that takes center stage.  It's a quick read, you won't regret moving it to the top of your TBR pile.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|i really cant say enough about this book. from the second i started reading this book i could not put it down. i have told everyone who will listen how amazing this book is. i have never written a review before, but because i could not get this book out of my head, i had to do this. i am so jealous of the person who gets to read this for the first time...if you are reading this review, you MUST believe me when i say that after you read this book you will be telling all your friends how badly they NEED to read this!
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I've been a Doctor Who fan for thirty years, back when it was only occasionally available on PBS. Fortunately it was also the time of vhs so I managed to record a plethora of episodes going back to Jon Pertwee.     Everyone will tell you they have a favorite Doctor. For many it was the quirkiness and smile of Tom Baker that first sold them. For others the suave sophistication of Pertwee. For me it was Peter Davidson for the very simple reason that, for the first time, the Doctor was no longer a character, he was a person. A bit stuffy perhaps, but a reasonably ordinary being with the same sorts of reactions as us humans to various situations. He was a the kind of guy you could really see yourself hanging around with and not always feeling a bit out of place.    When Doctor Who was revived by the BBC with Christopher Eccleston in the title role, I was initially dubious. He was too brooding, too angry, and his attempts at humor came off a bit sinister. Not my ideal traveling companion. But then David Tennant assumed the role and at last the Doctor was fulfilled. Possessing all the sense of fun of a Tom Baker, but with the ability to be a deliberate goof of Patrick Troughton. Yet in an instant he could become quietly menacing. And his rages (and their results) were frightening. In short, for me he WAS the Doctor, the regeneration it had all been leading up to.    Naturally, learning that David would depart after only four years raised a concern for me. There was even talk that the show itself could be cancelled. How could the top David?    Well, they didn't. They did something better and something earlier teams of Doctor Who producers and writers had known since William Hartnell announced he was leaving the first incarnation of the Doctor. They went sideways. And with delightful effect.    Matt Smith has qualities that wouldn't sit well in David's Doctor, but which suit the new direction of the show to a tee. He is, by turns, absent-mindedly brilliant, goofy, geeky, thoughtful, charming and, ultimately, unique. Just like all prior Doctors have been. And it works. Again.    In addition, the transition to the helm being manned by Peter Moffett is producing many of the most intricate, thoughtful and engaging stories. The high standard set by such earlier incarnation episodes as the brilliant \\"Blink\\" (Season 3) is being nicely maintained. It's even being played with, as demonstrated by the Doctors use of the Matter Transfer wrist devide in the final episode of this latest season.     All in all, the Doctor and his latest, perhaps most charming Companions (Rory and Amy) promise some exciting heights to be reached in Matt's second season (provided he never ever dons a Fez again. That was just so wrong. Really.) For this first season we are treated to a fantasic episodic science fiction series merely shifting gears and making a sharp turn, tires squealing the whole way. And anyone who enjoys sci-fi, wit, excitement and thought-provoking concepts could do much worse that this latest season.

B003XMUFGQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B003XMUFGQ Clapton]]It sounds like one of those Can't-get-enough-of's. But, of course, Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. In the meantime, I can't keep myself listening. As to the Why, as required by the Review Policy, this I'm taken off-guard, I'll review it, despite of having sounds around, that dwarfs any and all thought about looking for rhymes and reasons, for the can't-get-enough-of.
0385737955|4.0|I liked this bok, it reminded me a lot of The Lordof the Flies in the way the children create their own society have laws/rules they live by, They strugle against an outside evil but mostly with each other and eventualy a hero reveals himself. The ending was an unexpected twist however. Its darkness and complexity didnt seem to match the rest of the book. I am looking foward to reading the second book in the trilogy.
0312370849|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to my friends.  Having had relatives in Paris who lived through the round up, it gave me incite into what they must have gone through.  I love the way the story is told and I didn't want it to end.  This is a book you will read and then want others to read.
B003YK42LQ|3.0|This is not a terrible effort- in fact it is a rather unique artistic effort.  After a few listens it begins to endear itself somewhat, and one must give a few good listens to anything before rendering fair judgment.  With that, unique artistic effort doesn't always translate to something that appeals to the masses- Radiohead is an excellent example of that.  I think much is expected of Kings of Leon given their recent success, and this album is probably more about who they really are.  Come Around Sundown seems to be a unique blend of alternative rock and blues- something like Dave Matthews Band meets Marc Cohn.  It has its moments with tracks such as \\"Pyro\\" and \\"Radioactive\\", and at times would seem to inspire some hope in the album's overall potential.  In the end, it left me thinking, \\"Hmmm...it's okay....\\"
B003EYVXT6|1.0|Don't waste your time or money.     This was the worst movie I've ever seen.  Any other awful movie I've seen in my entire life is now obsolete.    The science is interesting - far out but interesting....  but that's all lost because the \\"scientists\\" are so unbelievably stupid.  Some examples:    This creature stabbed me with its stinger and threw me into convulsions - let's put it in a dress and pretend it's our daughter!    Hey, the thing I made in a lab and is bizarre in every imaginable way looks a LITTLE like a chick - I think I'll have sex with it!    When our genetic experiment that we know virtually nothing about \\"dies\\" - lets bury it in the back yard, not burn it.  We'll burn EVERYTHING else though.    Anyone who writes a review about this movie greater than one star needs to quit crystal meth.
0375842209|5.0|I won't give a book report as other reviews give great detail but I will tell you why I give this five stars and why I admire this book.  For the first time I wished I had a Kindle because I wanted to highlight what I found within the story to be exquisite, golden nuggets of writing that made me stop, reread, and ponder before I continued with the story. I (and others I encouraged to read) did have a hard time getting through the first few paragraphs, so stick with it.  It is a gorgeous piece of writing.

B00006NSZ5|4.0|The CD was decent, not perfect but okay for used. My husband said on a scale of 1 to 10 he would give it an 8 as far as scratches go. Quick shipping and the seller was easy to deal with.
B00005CDUE|5.0|Roxy Music was the genre-bending 1980s Euro-rock band that was one of the few that created a sound that stood the test of time.  Bryan Ferry, a \\"bonafide rock star\\" led this super group and eventually broke out on his own.  This top-notch collection of their hits is a great starting point for listeners new to the Roxy Music sound.  Their provocative music, led by smoldering front man Bryan Ferry is as erotic and haunting as their controversial album covers.    Predictably, in a nod toward their songs with the most mainstream appeal, the collection starts out with Avalon, followed by More Than This, which are the most accessible of their songs.  As you listen further into this set of songs, it is obvious that you recognize most of them even if you don't know them by name.  Roxy Music's impact on music is unmistakable - their unique sound has been imitated often.    \\"Deeper cuts\\" for listeners would probably be the best of Bryan Ferry.  An obvious next Roxy Music album choice would be the quintessential \\"Avalon\\" or \\"Country Life.\\"  \\"Best of Roxy Music\\" is a fantastic collection that should please both purists and casual fans.  Besides, what else are you going to play when you have the red wine and seduction ready?
B0034GK7DM|5.0|I enjoy listening to this CD,I love music form all area of music.  I love to listening to music that makes me happy.  I hope to getting more music from this artist,Corbin Easton. I saw the Video on CMT and thoroughly enjoyed it.
0399226907|5.0|This book is the perfect size for little hands. It's the thick hard cardboard and even has the cutout circles like the bigger book. I'm so glad I got this for my daughter.
B002ZG974M|5.0|Movie was wonderful. This was ordered for a cultural diversity inservice with our staff and proved to be a very informative yet entertaining movie. Everyone loved it.
B003INBNXO|5.0|If I could give this movie 10 stars I would!!!  I was skeptical about this movie.  But, when I saw if from the opening scene I could tell that it was special.  The cinematography is INCREDIBLE.  The story, (not sure if all of it was true) but the story was so engaging.  The fight scenes were not too far out there like \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Wires\\".  Instead, they were done very intensley and with great editing.  The sound was great as well.  Nothing too \\"Black Belt Theater\\" where everyone sounds like they are flapping their wings.  The story was very well told.  Drama wasn't too drawn out.  You actually cared for the characters.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.  Incredible.  I've already seen it 3 times!!!
B003JSSPSY|4.0|A good story line, somewhat different from the books. Still; true to the basic story  line. Liked the books more than the tv series.
B000002LE6|5.0|With \\"LoveSexy\\", Prince ushered his audience into the New \\"Power\\" Generation. His newly trademarked fusion of Funk, Jazz, and Hip Hop almost completely redefined his celebrated \\"Minneapolis sound\\" (Sign 'O The Times, uniquely different from any Prince record before it, only hinted at the revolution Prince's music would experience one year later with LoveSexy). The CD, an achievement to this day, is great in spite of it's 1-track format(a continuous-play concept that prevents any shuffle re-arrangement or track skips. This means anytime you want to hear a song outside \\"I No\\" (the very first song of the disc), you have to sit thru all those before it -  worse yet...you'd have to fast forward all the way to the song you want to hear ! A task of time, to say the least ! I Have done it (and it usually destroys interest in that song altogether). Alphatbet St. being the standout song, Lovesexy has stood against time, and is still a phenomenal work. Notoriously spiritual, this record is truly SO MUCH FUN !    RATE SCALE 1.0 to 5.0        I No...  4.9      Alphabet St.   5.0      Glam Slam  4.0      Anna Stesia  5.0      Dance On  4.6      LoveSexy  4.9      When 2 R In Love  4.6      I Wish U Heaven  5.0      Positivity  4.9        Live and Listen !

B003YBNREI|4.0|The only Doobie Brothers album I had prior to this was the double CD greatest hits. I don't know why I bought this, but what a surprise! The songs \\"Nobody\\" and \\"World Gone Crazy\\" could easily have been \\"greatest hits\\" as well. While the first 2 and last 2 songs on the CD are weak (I always skip them), there are still 7 solid tunes in between. Tom Johnston's voice sounds fantastic, the sound quality is superb, the musicianship sharp, but most of all these songs rock and make you feel good! I'm really glad I took a chance with this one!
B003ZK58WM|2.0|Pillars of the Earth is still one of my favorite books and Fall of Giants isn't even in the same ballpark. I was looking forward to another epic from Ken Follett but the character development was not at all impressive, especially for such a long read. Really, the story telling was just not particularly interesting. If not for the few scandalous love affairs, it would have been a real snooze. And for twice the money of any other Kindle book I've purchased! Overall, I'm quite disappointed.
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|Temple Grandin is a very unique individual that the producers and especially Claire portrayed exceedingly well!  I love the insight into Temple's world and others with autism.  THANK YOU to everyone that had a part in making this movie and revealing to us aspects into another's life that open our hearts and our horizons to MORE and MORE!
B00004WFAB|5.0|When I came upon this a few months ago, I jumped on it.<br />8 180gram Audiophile pressed lp's for less then $80 is<br />just ridiculous! The music speaks for itself. The packaging<br />is one of THE best boxed sets I've ever seen, and the<br />pressings are fantastic. Very quiet vinyl, fidelity is, imho<br />better, much more natural and exciting soundind than  the<br />newer cd's, and I have them all. So again, don't delay because<br />as of November I've seen an increase in Hendrix Vinyl prices<br />at all retailers, from Oldies.com (which is where I picked this<br />up for a whoppin $64!!), to Barnes and Noble, to Cd Universe.<br />Don't know why but it does look like the older MCA pressed<br />stock is probably getting low. They are all out of print and<br />when the current stock is sold look for the prices on all the<br />MCA pressings to go up and up!!<br />Enjoy the music and to Janie.......Thank you so much for your<br />oversite of the catalog. You've done us fans and Jimi very<br />good indeed!! Keep up the good work.<br />Gerard Masters
0307454541|4.0|I picked this book up after I had finished reading another book during a long layover. The book has a pretty slow start but once the plot starts developing, the story definitely picks up. The story becomes twisted and quite sordid at times. The ending felt a bit rushed but overall it was a good book and I'm likely to pick up the second book.
B001R6KCIG|5.0|This is the true Genesis sound. Songs that tell a story, of a world not of this world, but one that we can relate to. What a reunion this band could make. When Peter and Steve left the group it changed completely, it lost the magic. The journey to the other worlds was over. But I put this album on and I am there, back again.
B0036TGSR6|1.0|Agenda driven America -hating drivel! The central plot is that the CIA kills gobs of people to protect knowledge that a British Prime Minister renditioned terrorist to the CIA to be waterboarded.The Prime Minister is corrupted by the evil  Halverton Corp-get it- Halverton Corp. You know the leftist favorite punching bag Halaberton.Roman Polanski, the convicted chld , rapist if he was capable of shame should be.   # 1 Waterboarding is not torture and was common knowledge.  # 2 Every American military pilot or special op,s personnel was waterboarded.  # 3 Thousands of innocent lives were saved from terrorist SLAUGHTER by this technic.  Great fun for the love your local terrorist fool. Made to indict Bush but Obama has raised the practice of redition to countries that do alot worse than waterboarding to an art form. Don,t waste your time unless you're a Code Pink idiot!The only thing this piece of tripe was missing was Matt Damon.
B001NU4CDM|5.0|I saw them on this tour at Towson State in Maryland. The venue was a bit like a highschool gym with the bleachers folded up to the walls. General admission. And it was one of the best shows ever. Very intimate, the sound was perfect, and they gave the best performance. And every time I listen to this album I am there. Their sound is crisp, lively, clear, and wraps you right up into it. I believe it was in '78 and to this day, when I listen to this album, I can see every bit of that show.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|In one day I tried the Coolermaster N520 (Horrible) and the Cooler Master RR-910-HTX3(Very Good) and finally,the Cooler Master RR-B10-212P-G1 Hyper 212 Plus (The BEST by FAR) I have a AMD Phenom II X4 940 Black Edition and the N520 left it HOT, but Not this one, ITS HUGE I MEAN GIGANTIC!!! if it will fit in your case its a must have! Buy an additional 120mm fan with it because it makes all the difference, it already comes with the clips for an additional fan so all you will need is the fan. you do have to remove the motherboard to install the Hyper 212 plus, but its worth the little effort and the x clamp they give you holds firm and steady while the others are kind of wobbly and unstable. BUY IT, YOU WONT REGRET IT! forget the higher priced models with all the hype, they are over priced and under performers! its Gigantic and kinda ugly but....THIS ONE IS IT!! quit searching and buy it NOW! hope this helped!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan managed to take an incredible series and build on it to create something even more incredible!!!

Can't wait for The Son of Neptune to come out so we can hear his story!
B000A59PMO|5.0|I saw part of a random episode of this tv show a few years ago playing on late night television and I loved it.  I really had no idea what was going on in the plot or what the show was even called, but it intrigued me in a way few shows can.  A couple of months later I was at a used video store and saw this DVD case of season one of Veronica Mars and I knew that was the show!  Thank goodness I got sick that week because all I did was sit on the couch curled up in a blanket watching this amazing story.  Of course the season one finale ended with such a nail biting cliff hanger that I actually ran out to Best Buy immediately and forked out fifty bucks for season two.  (As soon as I got home from Best Buy I went online and ordered season three on Amazon for a much more reasonable price.)  Once I finished all three seasons, I started borrowing them out to my friends and family, who also love the show now.  But don't get me wrong, I'm a rabid fan and all, but I know the series has its faults.  However I think you'll find its complete awesomeness far outweighs any shortcomings.  Just watch, you'll see.
B00422LESE|4.0|...meaning nothing new for me, as a follower of Hawking's work. The real benefit is the clarity of ideas and the posibility that we might have apeared in this Universe purely by chance. A book to read.
B001I5M9SC|2.0|Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  This time it's my fault.  This is the second audio only so called BluRay disc that I've bought from Amazon, not realizing that they produced no video output.  Amazon customer service was most courteous in refunding my first purchase.  Amazon however has not yet indicated on their web pages that such discs are audio only prominently enough not to fool fools like me.  My only excuse is that the music material is so very much to my liking that I ordered it too quickly.  Hopefully, I won't do this a third time.  Amazon could help more.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|Historically speaking, Jeff Beck rates as one of the greatest guitarist of all time.  Making his mark in the late 60's while playing with some of the gods of rockNroll, he earned his respect and still perfoms quite well to this day.  I used to listen to this album as a teenager in the early 70's.  I recently purchased the CD, and as I rembered it is a priceless recording.  A couple of things make this recording unique.  Number one,,, guess who the singer is???  YOUTHFUL ROCKING ROD STEWART.  Perhaps his first major gig.  His voice is as pure as ever, if not his sweetest.  He does sing with  more of a true rock style than in his later career as a pop singer.  The second thing that takes this recording to another level is the song selections.  Can you imagine Jeff Beck playing Old Man River, and having Rod Stewart singing the song.   How about \\"Zeppelin's, You Shook Me\\".     This music is timeless as is Ellington and Bach

B0026P3G12|5.0|From the first time I heard her sing on \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" through YouTube, I was amazed at the voice of this humble, talented woman.  This collection doesn't disappoint.  But the one thing I noticed is that all of the songs sound sad, some more than others.  \\"Cry Me A River\\", The End of the World\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\" are songs that I normally think of as being sad.  But others like \\"Cheer up Sleep Jean\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" aren't ones that I would think of that way, but the way she sang them give kind of a melancholy feeling.  Or maybe it was just my mood the day I was listening.<br /><br />At any rate, I loved the recordings.  The spirituals were unexpectedly great.  I'm looking forward to the release of her next CD, \\"The Gift\\" and many more to follow.  She is indeed a great talent.

B003YUC2FE|2.0|I must say that I am disappointed at Disney for releasing a product in this manner.  Here is a breakdown of the rating:    Movie - *****    Packaging - *  There are two primary groups this set appeals to, in my opinion:  Collectors ...  ... but this is extremely impractical from the storage standpoint.  The packaging takes approximately 4 times the storage space of 3 combo packs of this movie on a library shelf.  The missing bonus materials content from The Ultimate Toy Box DVD set makes it even more difficult to justify the amount of space it takes up.    Parents ...  ... that want all three movies playable on DVD, Bluray, or Digital Format.  Since there are no real content frills added to the normal combo pack set of discs, the scenario that some parents prefer to have \\"one packaging\\" for all three movies instead of three separate media packs for frequent playback should be considered.  On that end, the cheap cardboard packaging will not suffice.  It not only will fall apart over a short period of time, but the way the discs are inserted lends themselves to be easily smudged and scratched by the young.    Content of the Set - ***  The content of the set did not include the previous Toy Story Ultimate Box Set DVD features, which is extremely disappoint given that I intended to replace the DVD box set with this but now I have to reconsider.  You can find out what is missing by reading the reviews on that set.  If it wasn't for the inclusion of the 2 digital copies of the first two Toy Stories, I would have rated it 2 stars.    Conclusion:  Buy it if you do not have kids handling the discs themselves and you do not already own The Ultimate Box Set from the previous release and don't care about the extra materials.    For those that have The Ultimate Box set, I would recommend simply buying the Blu-ray versions of Toy Story 3 for now and wait for the 3D version and perhaps then, Disney will come to its senses and release all three films in an all-inclusive \\"Toy Box\\" with EVERYTHING. (We can only hope.)    Since this review is more specifically about this \\"set,\\" I have given more weight to it than the actual movies themselves.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|The CD is uplifting and makes you want to dance.  Good songs that you can sing to.  Love it.
B003YUC2FE|4.0|Yep, the foam packaging is lazy and leaves much to be desired, and the greatest animated film trilogy ever deserves much better treatment than this.  However, the pricing on the 10-disc set is unbeatable, and there seems to be two ways of solving the packaging \\"issue.\\" The easy choice is to buy the three films separately in the combo packs, which currently run about ten dollars more than this \\"complete\\" set, yet lack the digital copies on the first two films, but have correctly sized cases. The other, slightly more complicated choice for the video purist is to simply buy a 10-disc replacement DVD case (they do in fact exist in this configuration, and there is at least one online site that will sell just one case) or any combination of the single/dual/multiple replacement DVD/blu-ray cases for the 10 discs. Removing the foam and inner cardboard liner frees up space for the replacement case/s in the toy box, as well as for the earlier DVD versions of TS and TS2. These films are worth the extra effort, and deserve a place in every animation buff's library (minus the non-recyclable foam, of course.)  ;D
0060775858|5.0|Everyone has mentioned all of the great things about the book.  I will just mention that if you didn't have it when you were a child, you will enjoy it yourself.

B0042OZDQG|4.0|if you MUST get only ONE joe satriani cd, let it be this one. it has a pretty standard mix of joe's hits, including most of his best work. if you have the budget, and are truly interested, you should just go ahead and buy his individual CDs in order of appeal. they are pretty cheap, and each one is a fantastic mix of it's own. there are simply too many songs to fit on two, or even three CDs, but this one is a good buy for those who simply don't want to buy all 14 his studio albums.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I bought this for the grandkids to watch- and you need to have seen Ironman 1 first to have a clue of what is going on in the beginning.  A bit of violence - less than Ironman 1 which I bought afterwards to seee what I was missing (I would not recommend that one to kids under 13) it is rated PG13.  It was colorful entertainment. Extra DVD's of the characters all patting themselves on the back was rather a waste of time - although I did not realize how many people used to be into comic books characters (as if they were living breathing people). It was interesting to see different facets of the animation process using computer graphic software
0439023521|4.0|The book itself was amazing and I loved reading it, but when I got the book the front of the cover was bent.  It's not a big deal, the book got here right away and I hope this shows as a positive review for the seller.
1401310400|1.0|I was totally disappointed with this book.  It is a TINY paper back written in a TINY font.  While the story line is OK, the logistics of the book are terrible.  I would recommend a different media...e-book, hard cover (if available) or Audio book.  I suspect this is ABC's inept marketing approach to providing authenticity to the Castle TV show.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Excelent product! Perfect! Without delays, coming even before the estimated date. I recomend to everyone
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|My husband and I have the DVD of this concert and had to have the CD so that we could listen wherever we were. It is so great. Winwood and Clapton together!! Every song is worthy.
B003DZX3US|5.0|I confess, Beauty & the Beast was my favorite of all the Disney animated films I purchased for my own children and watched with them.  I've decided to update the whole collection on DVD as they became available (we don't even own a VCR anymore), so I purchased this as soon as it was on sale. Got to watch it with my (now 21-year-old) son just 3 weeks ago and we both found it even more enchanting than we remembered it; the color is spectacular and the blue-ray really does make a huge difference--everything has an almost-3d effect that added immensely to our experience. What a special, timeless story this is; the characters come to life and are even more charming than ever; it's a triumph of human spirit and the power of love to see real beauty within.  The extra interviews with the composer really gave insight into the creative process of the film, and gives a beautiful tribute to its late lyricist (the real force behind the whole production), Howard Ashman.  Worth every penny, and a delight to treasure for years to come (maybe--if I'm lucky--I'll get to watch it with my grandchildren one day!).
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Lost complete collection is totally worth buying. It's all that Lost fan could wish for.
0440243688|1.0|Childs has just run out of ideas and has padded this book so badly with descriptions of Manhatten Streets and the New York subway system that it is a total bore.  I got halfway through it before I came here and read reviews which verify what I found.  Maybe an author is good for about a dozen books, and like Grisham, keeps writing when he shouldn't.
1932100660|5.0|This is the best book on nutrition that I have ever read. I have changed my eating habits permanently because of the book.
0061997811|5.0|When I first got my hands on this book at a local bookstore, I could only imagine the wonders in it, as it was completely sealed in plastic wrap. I assumed it would be a great film guide with a few surprises, but I never imagined it would be as extraordinary as it was! The vivid color photographs and concept art really make you appreciate the movies and books even more. You really get to study the detail, where as in the movies, you are just passing through, far more busy with the characters and stories to notice all those little details that give the places and things they see, touch, and use that give the movie so much more life. Most Making Of books don't include the actors much, we hear mostly from the set designers, directors, etc. But in this one, you get first hand interviews of all of the key players and many supporting actors as well. Easy to read, but immersible into the world. Just like the novels themselves, meaning whether your 10 or 50, you will enjoy reading this book! The fact they included Deathly Hollows Part 1 and 2 is fantastic, being we don't even have the movies out there, so such a thing is unheard of to release so much. And as my fellow reviewers pointed out, the inserts throughout this book make this a MUST for any Harry Potter fan. Even if you don't like the movies, those inserts are still a great addition to anyone who loves the novels! You have the Marauder's Map for instance, who wouldn't want that? And for those looking to cosplay as characters from the series, I highly suggest you check out the copy of Advanced Potion Making. Its not a replica of the book, just the cover. But what's inside the book is just fantastic. Label stickers with various potions and ingredients. Buy some old bottles of different shapes and sizes, make some \\"potions and ingredients\\" to match, and stick the labels on the bottles. Then line your kitchen spice rack with them or bring a few with you for cosplay. This is also a very good reason to get TWO copies of the book, one to keep pristine and the other to pull out all the fun things. Also included the letter sent to Harry by owl accepting him to Hogwarts. The Proclamations by Umbridge. Nearly anything you can think of is there, for you to hold. Though of course we all know they are nothing more than replicas, it still feels very neat to be holding a part of Hogwarts in your hand. I don't know about the rest of you, but I got my ticket to the Yule Ball, I'll see ya there!
B003Q6D25K|4.0|If you didn't like the first Paranormal Activity I strongly doubt you will enjoy Paranormal Activity 2 so don't even bother, stay far away from it. I was one of those who liked Paranormal Activity and thought it was entertaining and somewhat different from other horror movies as well. The concept of all these paranormal events going on and purposely cheaply-made film was intriguing and best of all, it worked. The thing is there were parts were I was genuinely scared, I couldn't help but be a little freaked out by what the characters were going through. This second PA movie is actually the prequel to the first one and not a traditional sequel like you would imagine, it has elements of both a prequel and a sequel (that's the best way of putting it). It can be a little difficult to imagine a second film that wouldn't ruin what the first one did, be different and still have the effect the first had. I was curious enough and found this one just as enjoyable as the first one. Paranormal Activity 2 doesn't really cover new ground but with careful improvements and changes, works just as well if not better than the original. I respect that they obviously didn't want to ruin what the first movie did which tends to be hard for a sequel, they clearly cared enough and wanted to show viewers something worthy (and I'll say it was).<br /><br />Paranormal Activity 2 begins two months before the first film and what happens in this prequel leads to the first. This time around the story is focused on Dan, his wife Kristi, Dan's daughter Ali and son Hunter who are-you guessed it-victim of paranormal activity. It's becoming clear to viewers that something is after baby Hunter and will go through anything to get him, even family members. Dan is a skeptic and refuses to talk about these events until it comes to a point he can no longer ignore. His daughter Ali believes and researches the events happening to the family. This leads to a situation. Now, the story is nothing new but it soon all falls into pieces. If you believe or not in these things is not the point, you are likely to be captivated, guessing and wondering what's coming next. What's interesting is that you see Katie and Micah from the first PA and you even see them at their house and Micah with his Camera. I felt this one explained more of what happened in PA which only helps of course. For me, when watching the first film it took some time to really get into it but once you're in, it's quite a ride. PA 2 is no different but there are some elements that made it even more enjoyable for me. It starts out nice and easy, then gradually things begin to happen and it gets progressively worse, it's a formula that worked well for the first and it also applies here. In this one the acting is much better, there are cameras all over the house and the story behind it all was really interesting. The family dog, a German shepherd named Abby who also feels a presence in the house; animals usually feel those types of things before humans do and only contributes to make things more interesting. In the first PA, it seemed things only happened when the characters were asleep, which made sense. This time around things happen both during night and day which adds another dimension to PA.<br /><br />I was definitely freaked out after viewing, I kept thinking about what I've just seen on the screen. Paranormal Activity is deeply psychological that's why it's so interesting to some and won't appeal to others. It certainly makes one think about the paranormal and raise questions, but that's probably what the filmmakers want you to do. If you liked the first one chances are you will also like this one, I probably enjoyed this prequel/sequel more than the first. I feared this one might be bad but I must say that the experience is just as valid as in the first movie. Some things about PA 2 are very similar to the first, yet it's also different in its own way, after all no one experiences things in the same way. Justto make things clear, it's not \\"the scariest film ever!\\" or \\"the worst movie ever made\\" as some reviewers said. You may have seen the first movie but are you sure you're ready this time around? 4/5.clear, it's not \\"the scariest film ever!\\" or \\"the worst movie ever made\\" as some reviewers said. You may have seen the first movie but are you sure you're ready this time around? 4/5.

B001GKJ2E8|1.0|To answer the question made by Wesley Gibson at the end of Wanted when he asked in his moment of sheer defiance at everyday life \\"What the @#&* have you done today?\\" I will answer that I have been forced to sit through a film that displays a piss poor attempt at merging the nihilistic philosophy of Chuck Palahniuk's \\"Fight Club\\" and the special effects of \\"The Matrix\\" with comic book camp.  All one has to be is literate enough to know about Palahniuk's work beyond the eclipse viewer sight that the film offered but then again in America not very many read so that is probably asking a lot.  Still, one doesn't have to look that far to see the attempts at replicating the style.      First of all, there is the droning of the main character/narrator Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) who is depressed with his boring life of nagging bosses, scraping by in a ratty apartment, a cheating girlfriend, and a less than laudable best friend.  This is similar if not exactly like the narrator of \\"Fight Club\\" whom many fans have called \\"Jack\\".      Next is the translation of the erotic.  Within \\"Fight Club\\" some have attributed the act of two bare chest men fighting and hearing the sound of fists slamming against bare flesh as homoerotic.  Translating this to \\"Wanted\\" and given how homophobic American culture is this erotica was facilitated by the dominatrix-like S&M relationship between Wesley and Fox (Angelina Jolie) who treated the newcomer as if he were a dog to be trained to do simple tricks.  The only thing that Jolie was missing was leather, a whip, and a leash for Wesley.      Another aspect that \\"Wanted\\" has done in its poor imitation of \\"Fight Club\\" is what Chuck Palahniuk had referred to in an interview as a \\"Social Model Theory\\" in which he talked about how popular fiction in the 20th century shows us how to behave in society.  One the one hand one shouldn't be passive or they may end up killing themselves and one shouldn't be a rebel otherwise the culture may kill them.  Instead, one should be more of a moderate observer.  He attributed this model to \\"Fight Club\\" in which Jack was the passive one and Tyler Durden was the rebel and by the end of the story they collapsed into each other to become the moderate observer.  This is the same model that is done in \\"Wanted\\" where Wesley Gibson begins as the passive one and nearly driving himself insane from his own monotony.  Then he becomes the rebel and would eventually be destroyed by the very people, The Fraternity, who created him.  However, in the end Wesley doesn't become the moderate observer.  Instead he still continues to be the rebel that would be destroyed sooner or later.  If only \\"Wanted\\" had the same insight as \\"Fight Club\\" instead of being lost in its camp of Michael Bay-like explosions and brutish and unintelligent fighting sequences.      The only thing that I regret apart from seeing this film is that I can't rate it with zero stars.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|This was a fun read.  It is intriguing and even has some scenes that are sexy without being overly graphic.  (Some people are squeamish about that sort of thing is why I mention it.) The characters are well fleshed out and charming.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|If you think about it, I mean *really, truly* think about it, The Beatles weren't together all that long---their recorded work spans a mere seven years, from 1963 to 1970. That's it. In their wake, other classic British rock groups like The Rolling Stones, The Who and Led Zeppelin took over the reigns left behind by the Beatles and went straight to the front of the line, just as a whole NEW wave of British bands started to come to the forefront in 1970, not least of all the bands of the progressive rock movement like Pink Floyd, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Yes, etc. It's almost as if The Beatles laid down the blueprint for ALL of these new (or new-ish) British bands to follow, saying to all of them, \\"Okay lads, THIS is how you make great music. Don't copy us, but follow our example, be adventurous, and make us proud. We're outta here.\\"     But SO prolific were the The Beatles, that they crammed SO much great music into those mere seven years---a dozen albums worth, in fact, from 1963's \\"Please Please Me\\" to their grand finale, 1969's \\"Abbey Road\\" (with the previously-recorded \\"Let It Be\\" released last in 1970). We all know about the in-fighting that finally broke them up, but it's obvious that another reason why the Fab Four closed up shop so quickly was because they were such workaholics, sometimes releasing two albums a year on a very hectic work schedule, and by 1970---besides not getting along all that well anymore---they were just plain exhausted. But what a magnificent musical legacy The Beatles left us. As \\"The White Album\\", \\"Let It Be\\" AND this album, \\"Abbey Road\\", plainly show, John, Paul, George, & Ringo still created outstanding music together even as they were coming apart.     After the troubled recording sessions for \\"Let It Be\\", it was quite obvious that The Beatles' days were numbered, and the band couldn't even face the task of going through the \\"Let It Be\\" material (that job was ultimately given to producer Phil Spector). They could've broken up right then and there. But thankfully, their pride kicked in one last time, and they decided to hang in there for one more album, do it right, and call it a night on a GOOD note. And \\"Abbey Road\\" was the result. Like all of The Beatles' albums, \\"Abbey Road\\" is a winner. The album even shows the band on the verge of going in a new musical direction again, considering the new keyboards and synths they used on it. Classic songs everywhere you look, including John Lennon's dirty rocker, \\"Come Together\\" (though to this day I still don't know what the lyrics mean!), and his even dirtier ode to wife Yoko Ono, \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\". Paul McCartney steps up to the plate with the great 50's pastiche, \\"Oh Darling\\", and the fun tongue-and-cheek song about a homicidal maniac(!), \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" (probably the least-liked song on the album as most fans will tell you, but nevermind---*I* get the humor of it!). George Harrison delivers two of his greatest compositions ever with the timeless ballad \\"Something\\" (which many people *still* mistake for a Lennon/McCartney song!), and the lovely \\"Here Comes The Sun\\". And good 'ol Ringo gets into the act too with his delightful song (and children's favorite), \\"Octopus' Garden\\". The album concludes in a BIG way with a series of wonderful, short song fragments pieced together in an extended suite, including \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", \\"Sun King\\", \\"Polythene Pam\\", \\"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window\\", \\"Carry That Weight\\", and, The Beatles' final message to the world, \\"The End\\"---with Paul's leftover bit, \\"Her Majesty\\", surprising the listener by coming in at the very end, a few seconds after \\"The End\\" fades out, and ringing the final bell on this legendary band.    There will *never* be another band like The Beatles. Thank God they came along when they did. What would the state of popular music be today without them? They changed the world with their music, they really did. And we couldn't have asked for a more fond farewellfrom John, Paul, George & Ringo than \\"Abbey Road\\". God bless The Beatles! :-)

B002JVWQSW|5.0|Modern Family is the most original comedy lately. Is not only original because it depicts two rather uncommon families, but because its style, which mixes reality television with acted comedy, has become a new genre in its own. And they now how to profit from this new genre. Great physical comedy, jokes, and acting. Very fast paced scripts. I recommended it absolutely. This first season will make history. Nice extras in the DVDs, although they could have been more.   One drawback I found is that the DVDs don't always run properly. I think there was a problem in the copying.
0385342047|4.0|I adore Sophie Kinsella and this series has not lost it's entertainment value.  Becky Bloomwood is one of those Lucy-type characters.  She always gets herself into wacky situations and this one doesn't disappoint.  I did get get dragged down in one or two place by the plot, but it quickly picked up again.  Becky finds that her daughter, Minnie, has become uncontrollable at two years and even though several people tell her that she is a normal two year, Becky goes into overdrive.  Which of course, means SHOPPING! This is such a wonderful plot and Becky actually shows signs of maturity towards the ends.  The end also gives a hint to the next book:  HOLLYWOOD!

B0017XD3OY|3.0|Will Smith is a muscled-up semi-genius scientist, who is also a high ranking soldier, who also loves Bob Marley and Shrek.  Um, ok.<br /><br />I am familiar with the book, which ultimately is just a fairly simple action-horror story, that can be easily adapted in a number of ways (and has).  The film is well-directed with some great camera work and sound, which saves it, creating a lot of tense moments, suspense, and action.  The CG infected are modestly terrifying, but like Smith's character Robert, pretty hard to buy into, which detract from its value.  Imagine a bunch of taller Gollums from Lord Of The Rings on steroids.  Yet it's a fantasy tale, so suspension of disbelief is necessary and works well enough.<br /><br />The special effects and digital/CG work are pedestrian at times, but the over-all Direction, acting, story and the camera work really save it, and make it worthwhile.

Mesmerizing and intellectually appealing, The Fall focuses of real human struggles within a surreal environment.  With superb writing and acting, The Fall is a cerebral and visual feast that must be seen, and will surely never be forgotten.

B002ZG993Q|4.0|My kind of movie, nearly. Starts in snowy Sweden, then moves to Italy and stays there. Lovely visuals, nice slowly paced taciturnity. Nice soundtrack too (done by Herbert Groenemeyer, a normally rather horrible German pop star; but don't worry, he doesn't sing here, just plays the piano, thanks Herbert!).<br />Great job by Clooney, the central character. The story is rather small, which suits the whole concept. Most of the time we watch Clooney practicing the craft of his character, or trying not to make friends, according to instructions and rules of reason. Or we watch him being bewildered, which he does very well.<br /><br />Despite the title, this is not after a Henry James novel. (I will review that one soon anyway.) The subject is only marginally Jamesian: an American expatriate in Italy, with some social problems and a special predicament. James was more interested in painters and sculptors and businessmen. Clooney here tries to pretend to be a photographer, but the local priest looks through him easily: you are a craftsman! The craft is assassination, which is a craft that James rather preferred to ignore, if I remember correctly.<br />Why not 5 stars? It is hard to take this lightweight piece of good entertainment too serious.
B00406UK5A|4.0|I'm a fan of Neil Marshall's films but I'll admit I didn't care for his last movie all that much. \\"Centurion\\" is a return to form for this talented genre director. As with all of Marshall's film the gore and level of violence is pretty high in this movie which reminds me a bit of \\"King Arthur\\" with its mixture of history, myth and the director's own creative fiction all poured into a flm that only Marshall could make. What it lacks in subtly it makes up for in creative mayhem and violence.<br /><br />It's A.D. 117 and Rome struggles with conquering the Picts that inhabit Northern Britain. The 9th Legion commanded by General Virilus (Dominic West of \\"The Wire\\")marches north to suppress the Picts with Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbinder \\"300\\" and \\"Inglorious Bastards\\")a survivor of a Pict attack on a Northern Roman outpost. When the 9th gets brutally picked apart (pardon the pun)Dias leads a group of survivors into the Pict camp to save the general only to find themselves on the run and hunted by the Picts.<br /><br />Marshall may miss some of the finer historical details (and in fact the fate of the 9th portrayed here is largely fiction with some historical basis for what happened to some of its men sent on a separate mission) but creates a memorable thriller this is notable for its violence and level of gore as it is for its performances. Still, as with all of Marshall's films, he creates a taunt thriller with surprisingly strong character moments within all of that violence.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks extremely good although blacks occasionally look crushed. Detail is sharp throughout.<br /><br />Extras include a commentary track with the director and members of the crew, the HDNet featurette \\"A Look at \\"Centurion\\", deleted scenes with commentary and \\"Blood, Fire and Fury\\" a behind-the-scenes featurette on the making of the film.<br /><br />A burtal, violent period thriller \\"Centurion\\" doesn't have as strong a dramatic plot of something like \\"Gladiator\\" but it is entertaining and diverting like most of Marshall's films.

B002ZG98XW|4.0|\\"Secretariat\\"<br />(Walt Disney, 2010)<br />-----------------------------<br />An enjoyable film about an epic horse, made as a true throwback to the corny, bio-pic storytelling of the 1940s and '50s.  First off, I appreciated that this film was family-friendly enough that I could take my young child to see it: there aren't many in-theater movies these days that are suitable for young children, or worth the use of their braincells, but this was a good choice.  The story of Secretariat, a remarkable horse who won the 1973 Triple Crown, is also the story of owner, Mrs. Penny Tweedy, who was a \\"simple housewife\\" who also happened to be a millionaire heiress (back in the '70s, when a million dollars still meant something!)  Although the horse, physically speaking, was not an underdog, Ms. Tweedy was -- a woman competing in the boy's club confines of professional horse racing.  The film's script pounds this home, touting her as a feminist standard-bearer during the heady era of the Vietnam War.  The war is also touched on, lightly, as Ms. Tweedy's teenage daughter becomes socially active in the antiwar movement (painting flower-covered signs in rooms full of earnest extras who look like a retro-oriented episode of \\"Glee\\") but the hippie stuff is just period-piece background color, peripheral to the real story, which is a standard-issue sports triumph tale.<br /><br />Intriguingly, the horse racing itself is minimized -- the training sequences are short, and most of what we learn about Secretariat's prowess comes from exposition, while the races themselves fly by all too quickly and are full of distractions, just like in real life.  Indeed, the filmmakers show the second of the three big races, the Preakness, from the vantage point of Ms. Tweedy's distant family, watching it at home on a grainy, smeared-image '70s-era TV (an interesting narrative choice, and also one of the most effecting evocations of the era in the entire film.  What horse-racing we do see is purely thrilling, exhilarating, shot more or less from the horse's POV, with pummeling sound design full of thunderous hoofbeats and snorting breath. My heart was in my hands during each of the races, and any horse lover will enjoy these sequences. Also impressive are the '70s couture outfits worn by Ms. Tweedy (primly played by Diane Hall); although the period costuming and other recreation of the hippie era had some emotionally inauthentic moments, it was still a fun flick.  Even John Malkovitch, who I frequently find unbearably pretentious, was relatively restrained here, and managed not to pull me out of the film too much.  In short, this is a nice, uncomplicated feel-good sports/horse film, certainly worth seeing if you're looking for something in that department.

0307474712|3.0|One look at this attractive book and I thought to myself, \\"Oh this is going to be very, very romantic.\\" Two silhouettes staring deeply into each other's eyes? C'mon. It has epic love story written all over it. I think it's for this reason, the expectation of grandeur, that this book was disappointing for me. It was more of a romantic comedy. Please don't misunderstand me. It was very enjoyable to read. It was exceptionally written. The way Nicholls creates such multi-dimentional characters and places, situations and atmospheres is incredible. You really feel like you know the characters. You get to see them both at their best and their worst. You are let into their psyche. Nicholls is funny, smart, and has a firm understanding of human nature and habits. It's this type of writing that makes bestsellers.   The story centers around the somewhat frumpy but ambitious Emma, and the suave, metropolitan Dexter who subconsciously have loved each other ever since college and, over the years, dance around each other and through other relationships while each remains the other's most constant friend. They let each other down, they argue, but they have falling outs. They try living their separate lives, but they find they are missing something essential and necessary. They have different lovers, but truth be told, they never fall in love with any of them and the relationships inevitably wind up in ashes. In the end, they realize that their stories are too intertwined to forget each other. The story is told only one day of a year at a time, St. Swithins Day, which turns out to contain some of the most significant moments of their relationship and of their lives.   The plot is not the its strongest point. It has few twists hence it's somewhat predictable.  Instead what keeps you reading is the irresistible style and humor. It makes the pages pass quickly and before you know it you are enraptured in these people's life stories. It is a wonderful book to read on a rainy day or whenyou just want some kind of connection. Personally, I probably won't reread it. It was entertaining but didn't really touch me in any special way. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a light, enjoyable love story. If you're like me and prefer something a bit mushier,  try Nicholas Sparks.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|The greatest rock and roll concert movie ever recorded. Once VCR's came in, I periodically searched stores for this concert; I couldn't believe that every other concert was released, but not the best of all. I remember seeing the movie at the Ziegfeld - great sound system - and thinking I was tasting a bit of heaven. I don't know why they waited, but better late than never. I agree with other reviewers: Mick Taylor created the Stones pure rock sound at its pinnacle of greatness, especially his ethereal take on Love in Vain.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I love this movie.  But potential viewers take note.  Right Wing Republicans will hate this movie with a passion.  It is more social commentary than anything else.  It is a rather stern indictment addressing our past crimes against nature and mankind.  It will make Right Wing Republicans squirm in their seats...not out of guilt, certainly, but from of being identified.  In particular it should make some of our oil companies quite uncomfortable as they are more or less continuing to this day old habits that started about 100 years ago or more.<br /><br />The story line runs parallel with what white Europeans did to most of the world during the age of expansion; i.e. they whiped-out out many indigenous poeples and cultures.  They raped the land. They took what was not theirs.<br /><br />Oh, wait, we are still doing it, huh!<br /><br />No, the Right Wingers need to protect their children from this movie.  It is well done and the social injustices and the environmental crimes committed are so obvious that the message may quite well interfere with the raising of more little  Junior Tea Partiers....we would not like that now, would we.<br /><br />This is a good movie.  It is extremely entertaining, well filmed and fun to watch.  The action is great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this one and hope there are more like it on the way.
B004132HZS|5.0|I usually am a purist when it comes to Jeremy Brett and his Sherlock episodes, but when I saw this, I was shocked how well done it was. I must have watched it five times already. And the end is so unpredictable! Any one who is looking for a new, great, mystery show, I recommend this 110%! A must buy.
B0013N3DSE|3.0|The Adventures of Robin Hood is my very favorite classic movie, I was so glad it's on Blu-ray.  I'm quite disappointed that it is not widescreen.  How can you update a classic movie for this time and era and not have it formatted to widescreen.  The color is great, the sound is wonderful, and the extras movie info is great also.  The only flaw with this Blu-ray movie is that it's not widescreen.
B000OVLBEY|5.0|Great movie, if your a super hero fan and are sick of the PG rating on the top movies...this movie is for you.  Forget about Nick Cage...the character Ghost Rider is awesome!
B0030S860A|3.0|Sadie, a young woman from the 1920s, attaches herself to great-niece, Lara. The two are inseparable and determined to find Lara's lost dragonfly necklace. But there's only one catch. Sadie is a ghost! She recently passed and lived to be 105 years old. At her funeral, she makes her presence known to Lara insisting that she won't leave until her necklace is discovered.<br /><br />This is where a whirlwind adventure begins. Lara stops the funeral claiming her great Aunt was murdered, files a police report, and starts hunting. The scenes are comical. Sadie has a witty sense of humor. Lara is often seen talking to thin air, and later dresses like a lady straight from the Roaring 20s. Flapper much?<br /><br />I picked this book up over a year ago when it was first released, read the first thirty pages and put it away. It just didn't hold my interest. I was sure it was good, as all Sophie Kinsella books are, but I just couldn't get with it until recently. I'm glad I gave it another try. Twenties Girl didn't keep me glued, but it was a fun interim read with a bittersweet ending.<br /><br />L. Marie

0312323867|5.0|I don't care that the prequel to this book is the Bestselling \\"Something Borrowed\\". This book surpassed the first book by miles!! Although one could argue that Darcy's change is abrupt, I think that such instant change is possible in real life considering the life-changing events in Darcy's life. A line in the book said something like: Sometimes crisis in life can make you learn an important lesson in life. Darcy's troubles forged her to turn 180 and become a better person.     I loved Emily Giffins voice through Darcy's character at the first half of the story. Darcy was convincingly bitchy and selfish and neurotic. Her character is far more interesting than her bestfriend Rachel's. The plot of Something Blue is so memorable that I know I will read it again someday and I know I will enjoy every word and every turn of events in Darcy's life. Her character is memorable and I will miss her.. AND by the way, I have been purchasing books at Amazon and this is my first Amazon review. YUP this book is THAT good, I have to shout it out to the world! :)
142311339X|5.0|Though not as good as the original series, I still enjoyed the book. Can't wait for the next.
B001FB4W0C|3.0|It came as soon as it was estimated, one thing tho, it came with a broken insides of the case and cd's were just thrown into place. I don't know it this is seller's or delivery fault. However, otherwise it's ok.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have seen True Blood 1 and 2 and will buy the next one when the price comes down - please....these prices are laughable.  True Blood, in my estimation is better than all the Twilight movies and any other Vampire, etc. series or movies ever were.  The difference is that True Blood has HEART - you learn to love the players.  I can't stand Kristen's character in the movies--she's like a stone and Robert isn't much better.  I think True Blood has the better stories, the better characters and all around is worth a BIG FIVE STARS!!!! but I'd give them 10!!<br />Sherrie Holtz
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I saw this movie twice loved it more every time. 3D effects are about the best i've seen.  The only other movies this year that could hold a candle to this are The Expendables and Red (retired extremely dangerous).  I recomend this movie 2 thumbs up.
0805087184|5.0|I bought this for my 10 month old grandson.  The format is large, so he can enjoy it while standing.  I am going to buy the rest of the series.
1935251740|4.0|Biocentrism is not the \\"Unified Theory of Everything\\" we've been waiting for, it is a great, mindblowing \\"Unifed Theory of the Nonsensical\\".   Every weird, contradictory, non-intiuitive notion of quantum physics is explained here reasonably well as a result of biology. I've also never been more convinced that space, and especially time, don't exist outside of our minds.  After reading this book, you'll realize you know much less than you thought you did, and you'll be more confused than ever. And isn't that what knowledge is all about? Highly recommend.
B00000JXAK|3.0|Music***, Presentation****, Sound*    Please note that I'm only reviewing the mid-90s Sony/Columbia Budget release of this disc, though Amazon may choose to place it along with other versions as well.    Judging from the praise that others are giving this particular reissue of the Trees' (to some) legendary album, most people today listen to music very differently from what they did a few decades ago, when striving for good sound reproduction from your Hi-Fi was all the rage. Don't get me wrong, CDs CAN be made so that they sound good, but this isn't one of them, to put it diplomatically. Flat, metallic, a pain inflicted on the eardrums.    Later versions of this album may be better sounding, but then you may not find such matters a problem, in which case you're a luckier man than I.    Musically, this is decent folk rock of the era, very derivative of Fairport Convention, very well performed, but lacking in originality and honesty. The term \\"jumping on the band wagon\\" springs to mind. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in this case it is. Presentation is fine, though, including sleeve notes.    Incidentally, to the reviewer who called this \\"UK Folk rock\\", think twice about using that term if ever you visit the Irish Republic. Still, you're right. There aren't many musical indications here that this in fact is an Irish group.
B00008977N|5.0|Wow! What a great concert to watch. Peter Gabriel knows how to take command of his stage as well as the audiance. It's awesome to watch the band members really enjoy thier craft you can feel it in thier performance and see it on all of thier faces. Paula Cole is awesome to watch and listen to her amazing voice. You can't go wrong to adding this MASTER PIECE to your collection!! Or to Someone elses !!      Patsy Layne O'Kieff
B001DF68MA|5.0|When we first open the box, we got a little discouraged however, set up was very easy and, my 10 month old son just LOVES  to ride w/dad. I would definitely recommend this product to other parents.
031603438X|5.0|Such a wonderful, exciting, funny, sad and often troubling read!  So happy he made it through.  Thank you, Keith!
B000056HE9|5.0|What can one say about this 1947 MGM offering?  Just plain tremendous!    Cary Grant as the angel Dudley is a bit devil, but he does not deviate from his mission, even though, he develops \\"feelings\\" for the beautiful, graceful, and talented Loretta Young.  Loretta Young plays Julia Brougham to perfection, the patient, loving wife of David Niven, an Episcopal Bishop.    David Niven's Henry Brougham is a man with a driving passion.  Unfortunately, his passion is not for his lovely wife, but his desire is to build a magnificent cathedral in this postwar town.    The season of the year is Christmas.  It seems at least in the movies that miraculous things happen at this time of the year.    The town looks like a Norman Rockwell painting with snow, trees, ice skating, the Robert Mitchell Boy Choir and music even to make a Grinch steal back to his hole.  Of course, you have to have a rich person who holds the keys to Bishop Brougham's dreams--so he thinks.     One of the best scenes is when Dudley takes Julia and Sylvester, their cab driver, ice skating--really ice dancing. It is priceless.  It's fun to watch.    Overall this film is a great Christmas present because it brings back a time when life's problems could be solved by a simple miracle.  The black and white noir is just fine.  Gather your family around and watch this delightful fantasy.    It was nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture.  It won the Oscar for Best Sound. It was based on the 1928 novel by Robert Nathan.    \\"Give exceeding thanks for the mystery which remains a mystery still -- the veil that hides you from the infinite, which makes it possible for you to believe in what you cannot see.\\" Robert Nathan
0525951652|5.0|Another great one by Ken Follett. I started this and could not put it down. I continue to be amazed at the research that Follett does on these books, this one is no exception.  I would recommend this to everyone as there is also a very good lesson to be learned . I look forward to the next one in this series
B000QFW7UA|3.0|I love this movie.. have watched it hundreds of times and never got tired of it... am glad that its on blu-ray BUT why this much for a single movie?????  Cmon Amazon I know you can do better than that!
B001VPJYZK|4.0|the cd's dont hold on because the cd holders are broken when i got it by mail it was like that already  but other than that the episodes are the best i like these whole seasons
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Fantastic Mr. Fox Review       Mr. Fox has chosen to give up his life of bird stealing in a promise to his wife and becomes a newspaper writer. After leading a very dull rest of his life he decides to purchase a new house and soon gets caught up in his old ways when he discover's he lives near three farmers. After the farmers realize what is going on they decide to retaliate and attempt to kill Mr. Fox and his family. Check out \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" to see their fight for survival.         Witty dialogue and a very comical style of animation really set this movie apart from others. \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" is amazing and has a superb cast which really help tie this masterpiece together. It was nominated for Best Animated Feature, and Best Original Score at the 82nd Academy Awards and lost to Pixar's animated film \\"Up\\". As I watched this movie I was amazed at how much character was portrayed in these animated animals. The crazy eyes of Kyler Sven Opossm and the trademark \\"whistle and click\\" of Mr. Fox are just a couple of the little touches that really bring out the character's in this film and really instill them in your head.       The voice acting in Fantastic Mr. Fox is phenomenal with great actors such as George Clooney (Mr. Fox), Meryl Streep (Mrs. Fox), and Bill Murray (Clive Badger). The comedy in this movie never seems to run dry. I let out some really good laughs during the movie, and it is pretty funny to see the situations Mr. Fox gets in and how he handles them.   I did not read the book, I didn't even know it was based on a book, but I would say it does the book well. This is a great movie and can for sure provide entertainment for anyone.  I give it a 9 out of 10    This review and more at  [...]
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Unlike Band of Brothers, which I stop and watch any time I catch it on TV, the Pacific is just not near as good.  I found myself lacking empathy for many of the characters and even developed a healthy dislike for some of the main players.  The feel of this series is very similar to BoB, so if you enjoyed how that series was presented you'll enjoy The Pacific.  Since I had difficulty relating to the characters and the storyline, I just don't see myself watching this again.  Worth a once-through though.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|Bumps in the night and scary things return in \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\". This time the haunting isn't happening to Micah and Katie, but are now happening to Katie's sister and her family. Kristi and Daniel Rey begin to experience some odd things in their house after their son is born. These start with small things such as the pool cleaner climbing out of the pool at night and eventually grow out of control where people in the house are dragged down stairs.         \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" is not the sequel to \\"Paranormal Activity\\" but actually the prequel. This gives some nice backstory to the first one and overall turned out to be pretty decent. The effects were nice much like the first one. The feel of a handheld camera and the look through the security cameras really make this movie, much like the first one, feel real. That is what I believe makes audiences freak out, the fact that they aren't seeing it through an expensive hollywood camera but through the eyes of something that is physically present in the house. Some of the moments in \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" don't really fulfill their purpose though. Some of the things that are meant to scare you actually turn out quite comical I will not mention these to avoid spoiling anyone's experience.       While \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" is more of the same it still makes a nice chill run down your spine and really works well with the first one. I was quite happy that the two stories were tied together. Let's just prey that they don't try to milk this for all it's worth and make a third one. Can we please let this end on a good note and not turn out like the god awful \\"Saw\\" franchise which died after the second one?  I give it a 6.5 out of 10    This review and more at   [...]
0307474712|3.0|I honestly do not know how I feel about this book. 1st off, I feel this book is WAY to over hyped. Its been reviewed in lots of magazine and newspapers as this great relationship book. I honestly feel this book got so much press and I am stealing this from Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Weiner, its because the author is a man writing about relationships. The story is about Emma & Dexter who meet in college and spans 20 years of their lives, on the same day each year. When you 1st read the book, you think \\"when harry met sally\\", but unlike that movie, the characters in this book are not likable. Especially, Dexter, and at moments you start wondering why Emma devotes so much time and energy to him. Over all the book is just OK. But I would not recommend it to anybody.
142311339X|5.0|I was skeptical when I found out that a there is a follow-up series to the Percy Jackson series. How can Rick Riordan possibly come up with more terrifying and evil villains? Do we actually need more characters/protagonists? Like most of you reading this, I loved the Percy Jackson series and hated the movie--- the movie came across as corny and making the protagonists in their late-teens/early twenties took a lot of the essence of being a demi-god in Riordan's world.    But I digress, of course Riordan, with some story-telling magic (he must be the son of Hermes)was able to pull it off. \\"The Lost Hero\\" is Jason, a demi-god with no memory plopped down in the middle of Nevada desert. To help this new hero are 2 more demi-gods, Piper and Leo. They were brought to Camp-Half Blood where Annabeth welcomes them. Unfortunately for Annabeth, Percy Jackson was missing. And to top that off, Zeus's wife Hera was kidnapped (who they need to save), Piper's dad been kidnapped too for dinner by a bad ugly giant and more monsters and oddities are waking up wanting to rule the Earth.     Not wanting to give away all the plot, the title pertains to Percy too, since we never found out where he was, although I am hoping that we'll finally get to hear from him in \\"The Son Of Neptune\\" coming out in 2011. I do hope that he wasn't tortured or was given too much of a rough time where he eventually ended staying.    Another thrilling read, witty and quick-paced, this beginning of the new series is a worthy follow up to the Percy Jackson series.
B003L77G06|1.0|I purchased this DVD primarily because Ed O'Neill was in it and TV Guides \\"the funniest show on TV\\", expecting to at least crack an occasional smile.  The \\"joke\\" was on me. This season DVD will go to the friends of the library and has, in my opinion, been a complete waste of my time watching it together with the money spent to purchase it. Not recommended!   Mr. O'Neill was a natural on Married with Children. What a great character he was on that \\"FUNNY\\" sitcom.
0553805371|5.0|The book es really good. If you arent a scientist or studying a science career, it will cost you to a little to uderstand first, but isnt impossible. The book isnt either a crithic against God o religion, its just the aproximation to te beginig of the universe, trough physicist´s view. My recommendation es a book you MUST read¡
B0015YDK1Q|5.0|who has this kind of time on their hands??Can't you just publish the 5 stars?
0316098337|5.0|Very different format than other books we have read. An entertaining quick read you won't want to put down!
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|A few years ago our family saw an IMAX 3D Grand Canyon film and it was amzing.  I was hoping that this would be similar......It's not.  It's an environmentalist wacko rant with contradictory statements and half-truths.  There are only a few good 3D \\"action\\" scenes but they are spoiled by fear-mongering voice-overs.  If you're the environmentalist type who thinks humans should have never inhabited the earth you'll love it.  If you're looking for a scenic 3D tour of the Grand Canyon don't waste your money on this junk.
B000E6EGX2|4.0|I haven't heard Schiff's live 2001 Goldberg Variations on ECM, however, this traversal recorded for Decca nineteen years earlier is satisfying in its own way. Schiff takes what I would call a middle-of-the road approach to the music, which is to say that he is halfway between Kempff, who produces a beautiful reading but is a little too romantic, and Gould who is, well, Gould. His playing above all is \\"correct\\" without being pedantic, and among the piano versions I've heard most closely approximates the harpsichord. His transitions from one variation to the next flow nicely and because he doesn't overemphasize the individuality of any of the variations, the feeling I get after listening is that his conception is organically whole. This approach, however, has its drawbacks as the personality of certain variations is lost, a prime example of which is the eleventh, which Schiff completely downplays.    Schiff's Goldberg lacks some of the character and edge found, for example, in Feltsman's less orthodox live reading; and if you listen to Gavrilov, who has a tendency to hammer home a point and take off in bursts of speed, which can be undeniably exciting, the differences are also apparent. But neither Feltsman's nor Gavrilov's Goldberg are for purists.     I'm still looking for the perfect Goldberg Variations, which I know doesn't exist; and while Schiff's set is one of the better ones I've found so far, I would nevertheless direct listeners to Charles Rosen's classic account which has more backbone and variety  ([[ASIN:B0000027VJ Bach: Goldberg Variations BWV 988 / Charles Rosen]]).    Three and a half stars, which I'm rounding up to four.
0525951652|4.0|I couldn't believe all the one star reviews.  Yes it's predictable that in the first book of a trilogy that it will end with all the main characters intact.  This is especially true when each character represents the point of view of a group of people at the time.  Even though I'd read the history of the time I was still unclear about how small events could lead to a world war.  I even knew less about the Russian revolution.  This book put all that into perspective in a very enjoyable way.  It was like having a front seat to history unfolding before you.  You know before you read the book that the world is going to war but this book lets you in on why.  You know how the war ends so it's hard to build suspense as to who will win so instead Follett takes these characters through the attitudes and feelings about the war itself.  I know this kind of story will turn some readers off.  It's not \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" with the exciting twists and turns but how could it be?  We all know how the twists end from our history books.  So, if you don't care much for history and are looking for an adventure story, this isn't your book.  But, if you want an interesting way to understand the attitudes and times of the early 1900's I don't know a more enjoyable way of doing it.
0307277453|5.0|First off, I wan't to say that I am by no means an avid reader. I'm usually turned off by the thought of reading books for pleasure. But, this book changed that. The book is an informative look into the evolution of humans from fish. It starts off discussing his find of Tiktaalik, a creature 375 million years ago that had an upper body similar to our own. This is the first great example of how we evolved from amphibians.        This book in its entirety is fascinating and without going into too much detail as to not spoil the book, a perfect read for college science majors. I highly recommend this book to aspiring paleontologists as well. To some the impact of this book into one sentence: Shubin's book delves into the study of evolution, from amphibian to man, studying the discoveries that led to this monumental claim that has awarded him fame and acclaim.
B004132I4S|5.0|First things first.  Sufjan Stevens is not just a writer of pretty ballads.  If you took \\"A Sun Came\\" and mixed it with that first Rabbit album, this is pretty much what you would get.  And seriously, listen to the song \\"Seven Swans.\\"  Don't get me wrong, I love a pretty Sufjan ballad but A) Those pretty ballads say some incredibly uncomfortable things and B) Sometimes pretty ballads don't accomplish your objective.  Besides, the dude needs some room to evolve.<br /><br />I get where the bad reviews are coming from.  The first time I listened to \\"The Age of Adz\\" I had a total Stravinsky moment...massive anxiety, heart palpitations, the whole nine yards.  And then when we got to all that phunking around in \\"I want to be well,\\" I thought he'd totally jumped the shark. (BTW, It's not an endless loop of f-bombs, but the old F does show up at a pivotal and easily discerned moment.)  It's hard to get to the heart of the thing when you have to wade through the endless waves of electronic pulsing and crazy shouting people, especially when the only lyrics you can discern sound like they were written by an angry 12 year old.  But you gotta get through the layers.  You have to see the album in its crazy, schizophrenic entirety.  It is an uncomfortable space-journey, super-dark and difficult, but at its heart this album is the brilliant and intensely self-critical work of a mind uncomfortable with what it sees within.<br /><br />So the best thing I can say is that you have to listen to this one with an open and deliberate mind.  Check out Royal Robertson's artwork...the music makes a lot more sense once you've seen it.  And if it doesn't click for you, that's fine.  It's not for everyone and it shouldn't have to be.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This is more than just another concert video with behind the scenes footage. It is a true documentry of the band and their lives, before, during and after and back again. If all you know about Rush is they are a great three man band from Canada, then you need to see this movie. And you are definatly going to want to keep it, not just rent it. The picture and sound quality are very good, but there is a lot of old footage that can't be helped. Candide interviews with all kinds of Rocker who are still being influienced by Rush. It's excellent and I havn't even watched all of the bonus videos yet.
0385732554|1.0|Just a note to say my smart, high honor roll children hated this book.  It was a 5th grade assignment.  They thought it was not believeable and just played a little game of which would be the lesser evil, reading this book 15 times or \\"The Lovely Bones.\\"  I haven't read it, just reporting their sub-optimal reactions.  Considering I would like my children to develop a love of reading, this book doesn't seem to fit the bill, though they did say it was thankfully quite short.
B004AUNS0A|5.0|HOW does this show keep getting better?!!  Damn!  I hang on every word of these episodes, they're so addictive!  I LOVE good Damon, and the ending made me want to weep for God's sake!  Why can't everybody just be happy?!!
B003DZX44I|4.0|My only complaint with this is the \\"Original Storyboard Version\\" which they claim is a BD exclusive.  This is simply the \\"Work in Progress\\" version of the movie (that you can find on the DVD Platinum Edition) reduced in size and stuck in the corner of the screen while the regular version plays.  Not a smart move.
6305428042|5.0|I was so excited to receive my own dvd copy of the movie Hocus Pocus.  Since I first saw the movie I fell in love with the story and the acting.  I also love the music and the comedy of the story.  Who knew that Sean Murray would wind up on NCIS as an agent?  Bette Midler was a scream  :)  as a wicked witch.  Sarah Jessica Parker was funny as a \\"dumb blond\\" witch.  It was like Harry Potter meets a bad bad witch who makes him laugh!  The story moves along at a good pace and has a surprise ending.  You will love owning this movie to watch it whenever you want.
0545265355|5.0|OK, so I admit that I used my pre-teens as an excuse to buy this Trilogy because Adam Lambert was reading it.  I'm a Glambert and thank heavens the rest of my family is as well so I have full support ;P  My boys both read the Gregor the Overlander series by this author and loved it, so when I heard that Adam was reading books by this author I didn't hesitate.  Amazon had a great price of about [...] with free shipping (Amazon Prime members) so it was a no-brainer.  I hoped to give it to my son for Christmas, but I may have to break into the box set to read them first!<br /><br />Since we enjoyed this author's previous work greatly, I expect that this trilogy will be no exception!  Fellow Glamberts, come take a peek into the books our ROCK GOD enjoys ~ LOL!
B001KOFH2G|4.0|Never watched Firefly or the Movie \\"Serenity\\" My son kept telling me I would like it.  After watching the series I had to have the movie and bought it on Blu-Ray.  Some people compare it to the show and say it isn't as good. I think they just miss the show this movie is worth watching just for the two fight scenes with Summer Glau, It could have been better if it wasn't trying to wrap up the loose ends of the tv show. I only buy blu-ray for movies i watch a few times a year and they are almost always classics, I'm 53 years old and not a big Sci-Fi guy but i do love Firefly and this Movie. A very nice surprise even if I did come to the party 5 years late.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book changed the quality of my life. It is a gift I am most grateful for.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I guess you could call me a nature documentary junkie. If it has to do with the life and times of basically any animal or biome, I'm interested. Planet Earth was a gigantic step forward when it comes to filming techniques for this type of content, and Life takes this advance and runs with it. Every single episode is full of absolutely stunning shots.<br /><br />I watched this series when it was on television, and I'm so happy that I could get this version with narration by David Attenborough instead of Oprah. Five stars, one that's going to be in my collection forever.
0385738757|5.0|I devoured this book in less than a day.  Like the Maze Runner this new installment is just as action packed and creative, and also leaves you with just as many questions.  But I felt like this one was moved a lot faster with a lot more answers given along the way... which pulled me through the story quickly.  I still stand firm in that this book was definitely written for an audience of young boys... with silly slang words and ridiculous monsters... come on now, creepy man like bodies with no faces and glowing light bulbs all over... unbelievable and too silly to be scary.  But if you can look past the silly parts... it's a great story!  Im a grown woman and I loved both installments of this trilogy so far and can't wait for the 3rd.. The Death Cure.  I can't wait to find out who this Brenda really is... how could she talk to Thomas in his mind??  Is she a part of WICKED after all.  And Im so curious about Teresa... I felt just as betrayed by her as Thomas does.  But I can't help but still think she is a good guy.  We'll see what happens... I only wish I din't have to wait another year :(
031603438X|5.0|Pure, unvarnished Keef, from childhood thru Bad Boy, parenthood, and Pirate ... in which he lays to rest various rumors, confirms others;offers recipes, guitar licks, and the stories behind the songs.

B000SFJWLU|5.0|The first song I heard from 5FDP was Far From Home and I couldn't get it out of my head so I had to look up all of their songs.  I wasn't disappointed.  The Way of the Fist has some awesome offerings.  They remind me a lot of Pantera, another of my favorite bands.  My stand-out songs from this album are: Meet the Monster, Death Before Dishonor, The Bleeding, Salvation, Devil's Own, White Knuckles, but all the songs are pretty awesome.
0596009208|5.0|At first glance, this book seemed a bit light on content and I was concerned that it might be a waste of money. Once I began reading it, though, I found myself completely engrossed in the material. Through example code, training exercises, and visual aids, the authors make the features and concepts of Java programming seem fun and entertaining, while still reinforcing all the details necessary to a beginner. I would highly recommend this book for any beginning programmer in search of effective learning material.
B0000CEB62|5.0|Watching this brought back so many memories of why I love this band. Oh, how I wish I could of been there too. The energy from the band and the fans is so awesome to watch. Hearing one of my all time favorite Depeche Mode songs \\"Somebody\\" by Martin Gore : ) I can see why Depeche Mode has continued to to only get better and put on great shows!!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Like so many others I discovered this band by Google-ing \\"Hung, opening credits song\\" found \\"I'll Be Your Man on I-tunes\\"  (don't hate me Amazon).. and have been hooked ever since.  I think Brothers is their best CD yet.  To hear more than 30 seconds go to you tube for their videos of Tighten Up and Next Girl... At $[...] shipped this is a crazy deal.  Give your sub-woofer an orgasm and treat yourself to a great CD from what could be the best American Blue Rock band that still rocks and will sell out venue but not sell out to corporate mediocrity.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|This movie kept me guessing the entire time! I went back and forth among 3 different theories throughout the whole movie. If you want a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and has plenty of action, then you'll enjoy this movie. Normally I am not a big fan of Angelina Jolie, but she was very good in this film.
B00275EHJG|4.0|As of my posting this this is the biggest film of 2010 and the biggest animated film of all time.    A good film.  NOT perfect.    You do get the point of the film pushed at you enough about Andy grown up & the toys ending up at Sunnyside.    They could NOT come up with new music.  We get AGAIN \\"You Got A Friend In Me\\" by Randy Newman.  We know Randy does the Pixar film music, BUT THE SAME SONG FROM THE 1ST FILM?    We get introduced to a bunch new toy characters, only a hand full do we really get to see/know.  Quick line near the beginning of the film as to why some characters from the first two films did not return.  An easy bail.    You may have heard you will tear up at the end.  Yes, you may.  They did carry the ending out a bit too long & as I said above you get the point all the toys have too much.  WE GET THE POINT, DO NOT NEED TO HEAR IT EVERY OTHER LINE.    The Buzz reprogrammed old story line from the 2cd film.    The beginning bit with the toys when Andy is still a kid was good.  One can always use a pink Vette.    Normal extras on this 1 disc DVD, but nothing special.  NO CHAPTER SEARCH LIST.      It is a good sequel, better than MOST 3rd films.  If you liked the first two films you will like this 1.    And, when Batman gets to be Ken  & a James Bond in the film as well, worth a look.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|If Avatar DIDN'T live up to the hype... I'd want my 2 and a half hours back, haha.     A visually impressive presentation with an adventurous and intriguing storyline just about sums up Avatar. It's a notch better than, say, Jurassic Park for instance. Sure, Avatar isn't focused around dinosaurs, but it does implement the adventurous aspect a tad better in my opinion. No boredom *anywhere* in Avatar, and a much much MUCH heavier attention to action and adventure. That makes it better than Jurassic Park.     Avatar is just a wonderful film with only a *little* bit of coarse language, so it's basically appropriate for any age. They do say the \\"sh\\" word occasionally though, so be alert for that when watching the film with the youngsters.
B0012GMZMW|1.0|All of you who think this album is good or great should admit to having cow dung from brains.  Seriously!  I took all of you \\"cow dung for brains\\" advice and bought this CD because you said it was great and I can honestly and truthfully tell you that I would rather hear Fran Drescher sing the American National Anthem then to listen the this CD ever again.  All of you who believe that this album is good or great should go to the kitchen and fill a small glass of water and mix it with potassium cyanide and drink the entire glass so you don't ever give bad advice to decent human beings who know the difference between real music and fake music.
0316779989|4.0|I love David Sedaris, but even I will admit that sometimes he takes a gag and runs too far with it. While the letters and narratives are funny, inventive, and well-written, they occasionally go on a little too long. The exception of course is the Santa Land Diaries, which could go on through Valentines Day and I would not complain.
0671042858|5.0|The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a small novel. Not only is it a short novel, a little larger than a novella, but it is small in scope. At least compared to many of the works of its author, Stephen King, who has been known to pen many a lengthy tale, sometimes into the thousands of pages.<br /><br />I read an interview with King once in which he said something along the line that he wrote two types of novels, one with the focus upon a single character and another which focused upon many characters.<br /><br />The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon focuses upon one character, 9-year-old Trisha. The plot is quite simple. During a hiking trip with her mother and brother, Trisha becomes lost in the deep woods. Her story is one of survival.<br /><br />But it's also a bit more than that. For an adult, this would be a story about madness, the madness of facing one's imminent death while stranded in an isolated place with little food, water, shelter or protection of any kind. For Trisha, the tale borders on madness, but is more about a child's willingness to adapt and overcome one's own fears.<br /><br />This is by no means one of King's most popular novels. In truth, I've run across a number of his fans who detest this book. I'm not one of them. Actually, I think it's one of the best things he wrote in the 1990s, the book itself having been released in 1999.<br /><br />Why do I like this book so much? Despite the darkness it sinks into, especially concerning a child, it is in the end one of the most uplifting tales I've ever read. It is about the spirit of survival in all of us, a spirit of survival that focuses upon the humanity in all of us, not because of ties to any particular nation or religion or what-have-you. It is a novel of high spirits, of the links that can bring all of us together as human beings.<br /><br />That is why I love this book.<br /><br />And since it concerns a child, I'll let the reader know that despite the horrific elements of this tale, it is one most appropriate to a child. Should you read it to your own kid? Well, read it yourself and judge for yourself. I personally wouldn't have a problem reading it to a 10-year-old, but I tend to think kids are much more versatile than most of us give them credit. But then, I don't have kids of my own, so who am I to say?<br /><br />Oh, and if you need to know who Tom Gordon is, he was a professional baseball player, at one time a pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, of which King is a huge fan. And yes, he is quite important to this story. Not as a character, but as a figure of myth, as someone to believe in, almost as an Arthurian figure in some ways, or perhaps a Merlin figure would be more appropriate.?

B004AUGOGU|5.0|I don't know if I have ever seen a tv show do this before.  This started off as a promising, good show three years ago but nothing that made you think it would be fantastic by its third season.  Well, that is where we are now in the third season.  I just watched this episode and I was riveted to the screen throughout.  First, Olivia has turned into being a far stronger character than I ever imagined back in season one.  She is marooned over in the parallel world and no one back in her usual world knows an impostor has taken her place.  This fake Olivia is very sinister and has an agenda. The real Olivia is going through hell and even goes into an isolation tank where she is given huge amounts of psychotropic drugs.  Additionally, she has begun having regular hallucinations of seeing Peter.  Her nemesis of course is the alternate Walter in this other world and he is a very sinister character indeed.<br /><br />As an aside, I was recently astounded to see the actress playing Olivia in an earlier British tv series.  Thus, I found out she is a British actress with the accent and all.  This series was the first season of MISTRESSES.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B002JVWRAO|5.0|Buying Supernatural from Amazon.com is definetly better than buying it in stores. For one, I would have to wait another month to buy it in Australia and it would be much more expensive. I got this for cheap and when it stated it wouldnt come in the mail for another month it came a week later! It was good quality and perfect condition. Amazon.com for the win!    I tip my hat you good sirs!!!!
B003UESJF6|3.0|The start looks predictable: a super-hero in tights, a super-villain who never wins but keeps trying anyway. In short, it had all the makings of a nicely animated but bland bit of cookie-cutter entertainment. Well, I'm wrong a lot. One startling plot twist early on caroms this into a whole new direction.<br /><br />Saying almost anything more would be a spoiler. (\\"Superman,\\" \\"Batman,\\" and the rest aren't named for the bad guys - why this one?) The animation is good, the one-liners keep it light, and the voice actors seemed to have a blast. Maybe people won't be talking about this one ten years from now - no matter, it will give you plenty to chuckle about on the way home.<br /><br />--wiredweird
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I likely don't have the words to do inTreatment justice. One would think in 2010 \\"therapy\\", a therapeutic alliance, would be recognized as a good thing, a place to go and talk of anything...with one who knows you perhaps better than anyone (over time). There are friends, relatives, troubled, issues, disorders...who would no more seek mental-health treatment, than walk naked into a high-school reunion. inTreatment allows you to be the proverbial \\"fly-on-the-wall\\", having almost embarrassingly candid/intense/intimate access to people in trouble. The show allows you to see how both therapist and patient struggle to find answers, understandings, and how growth comes in 'peal-experience moments...or over a number of sessions. Gabriel Byrne is the very invested, ultimately 'spot-on' therapist/analyst, finding fascinating correlations, articulated beautifully to his patient, that raises an eyebrow, or finds them in tears. Byrnes in very human, as the series allows you to see the therapist uncertain and seeking...though he rarely falters.<br /><br />In season One, and season Two, the patients are three-dimensional, and stunningly portrayed by the actors selected for the roles. Monday you see patient #1 & patient #2 in session, Tuesday patients #3 & #4. The following week, you watch all four patients continuing his/her treatment. Very clever arrangement. I've likely overdone this review, but I so enjoy each moment of the show.<br /><br />inTreatment in not \\"light\\" viewing, and parental discretion is called for. Rather an opportunity to tune-in to a stunning look at people in emotional pain, and see them working hard to get better...and they are better for the effort. The series will either bind you to every episode, or leave you cold (if you just don't get it...smile). Highly recommended for the intuitive, empathic, introspective and feeling viewer. I own season one, now season two on DVD, and hope those who can truly appreciate the honesty this HBO production delivers, will out-number those who find the series \\"boring\\". :sigh: smile, HIGHLY recommended!out-number those who find the series \\"boring\\". :sigh: smile, HIGHLY recommended!
1932100660|5.0|this book is the best book i have read this year.  finally a book which clears the air on what is true and and not true when discussing your health.  And on top of that, plenty of research to back up the truth that nutrition needs to be taken very serious, because it might well save your life, if you just learn to eat a plant based whole foods diet,  i now respect vegens, and perhaps vegens should be called healthy people, rather than vegens.    brilliant book
B002ZG98C8|5.0|If you don't appreciate the movie, you have no business watching it in the first place! This movie is hilarious, and Danny Trejo, my hat off to him, the way he had almost every, I think all, hot female in the movie ... Definitely a ladies' man in this flic - But other than the hot bods, gory intense violence (steer clear if you don't like violence which for me the more the better) was very witty! Definitely have to be open-minded and understand that the movie was put out there by Latins who are able to make fun of the typical stereotypes of Latin community! Definitely not boring, definitely will grab your attention!

In terms of bands who released stuff in the Eighties, they are number 1 with me. Anyway, this album is better than \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\", which I didn't care for at all.

It would make a fabulous mini-series!  I can't remember when I have read a book that held me so captive.  It was very well written--Ken Follett is brilliant!  I didn't mind that it was long, because it was so good.  I can't wait for the next one!  What a treat to have a book that uses your brain and has some depth.  I highly recommend this book. Rarely does a book this good come along.
076790382X|4.0|\\"You can't go home again\\" Bill Bryson sadly lamented as he drove across Junkville America in his first book `The Lost Continent'. But in fact, Bryson did eventually return to the US from England, settling in a small community in New Hampshire. This book (also known as `Notes From a Big Country') is a collection of short articles Bryson wrote for Britain's `Mail on Sunday' magazine, describing his impressions of the US for British audiences. As always, Bryson showcases his ability to find humour in literally any situation, and is able to make his quite serious points in a very witty and engaging manner.       Basically, the essays fall into five broad categories:    1) America as Heaven: much of the book is critical or neutral, but Bryson does find time to praise the friendliness of the people, the vast consumer choice Americans have, and the general high standard of living they enjoy.    2) America as Hell: Bryson attacks brain-dead television and commercials, the obsession with suing people, poor service, why nobody ever walks, and the trend toward bland \\"uniformity\\" in everything from coffee to motels.    3) Social Commentary: discusses things such as the War On Drugs, government \\"spying\\" on people, government/corporation spin, the Death Penalty, and the general ignorance of the world beyond American shores.    4) Facts about America: articles on the seasons in New Hampshire, regional accents and dialects, differences between the individual states, and ex-Presidents.     5) Observational humour: these make up the bulk of the essays, covering everything from the baffling complexity of a new computer/VCR/fax, \\"losing\\" a son to college,  the pros and cons of American sport, dealing with government departments, and what makes an American different from an Englishman.     As with all Bryson's books, remember his main aim is to be funny and entertaining. He is happy to distort the truth in the name of humour, so those critics complaining that he's exaggerated or fabricated this or that fact are kind of missing the point. Yes, he does bend the truth a bit, but his research is comprehensive, and he provides a wealth of factual information to complement his personal experiences.  Some may find his negativity grating after a while, but for the most part he keeps the mood fairly light, even tongue-in-cheek in parts, and generally avoids the snarky elitist posturing of `The Lost Continent'.      As a sideline, what I found particularly interesting about the articles was how the \\"native\\" Bryson seems so jaded and cynical about America, whereas his British-born wife seems fascinated by the gadgets and gizmos and consumer choice American people enjoy. I would have been interested to see whether she retained this enthusiasm, or whether over time the same things that annoy Bryson began to grate on her.     The original essays were designed to be published once a week, and it's probably a good idea to read this collection in short bursts. Trying to do the whole book in one hit will probably be a turn-off; Bryson does repeat himself occasionally and discusses the same topics (e.g. fatty food) in several essays. This is the sort of book that's best read in bite-size chunks, during airport layovers or morning commutes.     In all, another entertaining and funny Bryson book, that makes some serious points while still being highly readable and enjoyable. Four stars.
B003HC8I5M|1.0|Unfortunately Phil Collins has alluded to this Motown re-hash on previous tracks going back over 20 years. These re-works are not very good, the production is awful and his interpretations of the songs are lifeless.   A Very poor album indeed and a massive disappointment from someone who has been so enjoyable to listen to over the years.  I'm a big Genesis/Collins fan but I will be selling my copy of this rubbish. This is definitely not for me, and my advice would be to spend your money elsewhere
B003MZ0I84|2.0|I saw this for $5 online and figured I'd get it.  After previewing the tracks I must say its a little underwhelming.

Whoever made this call sucks ass.  Seriously.  Im in Chicago and this CD has no airplay.  Zero.  I wouldnt know it was out if it wasnt for Amazon's email.  The band.  The manager.  The record label.

B000GIXEIG|4.0|Oh good an epic Viking saga movie.  This is one of those.  \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" however is based upon the Anglo-Saxon literary piece \\"Beowulf\\" and the battle that transpires between them.  King Hrothgar leaves some of the story out and Beowulf has to figure out some of the details on his own.<br />IMHO, \\"The 13th Warrior\\" is a little better.  \\"How To Train Your Dragon\\" (animated) is almost on par with this movie, \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" although this movie has Danish people instead of Scottish or Irish in the character roles.  This movie (B&G) also talks about Valhalla and Odin enough to pique your interest, and gives the viewer a good idea of what a Viking castle more than likely was, instead of the stone walls and fortresses we sometimes romantically visualize as associated with Vikings.  The undertone of the story is that sometimes what we perceive as evil isn't always without justification, and that more effort to understand and empathize with our enemy makes us more respectable.  I disagree on both counts, but felt the movie had merit for authenticity, costumes, sets, and portrayal of brotherhood among warriors.  It is a classic tale that needs to be shared, and this movie does that well.  I didn't look very hard for reasons not to like \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" because I wanted to learn about the folklore tale.  I think there is a lot of toned down civilized ethics in this movie that doesn't fit though.  My idea of Vikings is more of a brutal warrior with nearly zero conscience against any enemies of the Norse people.<br />There is a 1958 movie called \\"The Vikings\\" with Janet Leigh, Ernest Borgnine, Kirk Douglas, and Tony Curtis that has been hailed as one of the best portrayals of Norse saga folklore.<br />In 1964, \\"The Long Ships\\" starred Sidney Poitier, Richard Widmark, Rosanna Schiaffino, Clifford Evans, Oskar Homolka, Edward Judd, Beba Loncar, and Russ Tamblyn and is a tale of searching for a bell made of solid gold; purportedly among the top ten best Viking movies ever made.<br />In 1978, \\"The Norseman\\" came out with Lee Majors, ex-L.A. Ram David \\"Deacon\\" Jones, Jack Elam, Cornel Wilde, Susie Coelho, that some have said ended up unintentionally being more of a comedy because of  some of the sets, costumes, and script.<br />In 1974, Walt Disney released, \\"The Island At The Top Of The World\\" which is a book based film set in 1907 where an airship adventure into the Arctic discovers a lost band of Vikings.  TIATTOTW is supported by a cast that includes Donald Sinden, David Hartman, Jacques Marin, Mako, David Gwillim Agneta Eckemyr, and Gunnar Ohlund.<br />In 1961, \\"Erik The Conqueror\\" came out starring Cameron Mitchell, Alice Kessler, Ellen Kessler, George Ardisson, Raf Baldassarre, and others; mostly themed as focusing around a war between the Vikings and Britain.<br />I've seen \\"The 13th Warrior,\\" \\"How To Train Your Dragon,\\" and \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" many times (I own a DVD of them), and of all the others I HAVEN'T seen, I'm guessing \\"Erik The Conqueror\\" appears particularly worthy of my time as well.<br />But I digressed a little bit.  \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" is worth owning if you're a Viking saga fan.  If you want the epic Viking saga that more or less defines all the rest before or since, it is probably the 1958 \\"The Vikings\\" film with Kirk Douglas.  \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" is still a great Viking film for your collection though.  Oh and BTW, the actor (Gerard Butler) portraying Beowulf is also the voice for the dad Viking in the animated \\"How To Train Your Dragon.\\"  \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" would have got 5 stars from me if the moment shared between Selma and Grendel would have included a little more \\"R\\" rated material.In 1978, \\"The Norseman\\" came out with Lee Majors, ex-L.A.

B001HN69AY|5.0|The fantasy is absolutely amazing, it reminded me of The Labyrinth. I was very puzzled and astonished by everything that went on in the movie, the plot is pure genius and the twists are just wow. I was rather confused by the ending though, I'm afraid saying more than that would be spoiling the movie. I think more should have been put into the ending, it almost seemed like it had a different ending but then the producers/editors didn't like it and added/snipped a bit. The characters... how to say this... how their personalities are portrayed later in the movie is also confusing, as it doesn't fit the characters personality... I would have changed bits of it, but at the same time I think its perfect because of that. It makes me analyze the movie and being confused just makes me analyze it more, whenever I'm bored I'll just think of this movie and let my mind go! The confusion makes it mysterious.
0375704027|3.0|When \\"Norwegian Wood\\" first came out in 1987 it was immensely popular in Japan, especially among young people, and made its author something of a celebrity. (According to the translator Jay Rubin, Murakami hated the fame it brought him and fled to Europe and America to escape). It is a nostalgic look on the period 1968-70, narrated in the first person by Toru Watanabe, a middle-aged man looking back on his days as a student at a college in Tokyo. The title, of course, is taken from The Beatles song, and its significance in the novel is that this was the favourite song of Naoko, one of two young women with whom Toru becomes emotionally involved; whenever he hears it he is transported back to the days of his youth. (Several other pop songs of the period are referred to in the text).      Naoko was originally the girlfriend of Toru's best friend Kizuki who suddenly and inexplicably committed suicide at the age of 17.  Kizuki's death has a lasting effect on Naoko's mental state, and she ends up in a sanatorium outside Tokyo. The other woman in Toru's life is Midori, a classmate at his college, who is confident, outgoing and in many ways different from the emotionally troubled Naoko. (She does, however, have some odd behavioural quirks of her own). The novel traces the development of Toru's relationships with these two very different women. The story is set against the backdrop of the student protest movement of the late sixties (although it must be said that the main characters do not take any great interest in politics).      Toru is majoring in drama, a subject doubtless chosen by Murakami to enable him to make frequent reference to other works of literature, especially Western ones. One work that has particular relevance is Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain which Toru is at one point reading. Mann's novel is about a group of characters who isolate themselves from the world in a tuberculosis sanatorium, and their situation is not dissimilar to the one in which Naoko finds herself, although she is mentally rather than physically ill.      This was the second book by Haruki Murakami which I have read, the first being \\"Sputnik Sweetheart\\". The two books have certain things in common. Both concern a confused, emotionally vulnerable young woman (Naoko here, Sumire in \\"Sputnik Sweetheart\\"). Both stories involve a well which takes on a symbolic significance and lesbianism plays a part in both. Here, the lesbian element is provided by Reiko, a music teacher and Naoko's close friend at the asylum, who relates her past history in some detail. The two novels, however, are quite different in style. \\"Sputnik Sweetheart\\", a tale of strange, inexplicable occurrences, can be seen as an example of \\"magic realism\\", whereas \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is a much more straightforward coming-of-age story, realism without the magic. It is a sort of Japanese version of \\"Love Story\\" with an equally gloomy denouement.     The characters were well drawn and I could find myself sympathising with Toru who finds himself in an unenviable dilemma, torn between the claims of two women. There were, however, elements of the plot which I found tasteless, especially Reiko's narration of how she was seduced by her thirteen-year-old pupil. I felt that at other points the tone of Murakami's writing was marked by a certain morbidity, a romanticising of mental illness and suicide. (Besides Kizuki, we learn about three other characters killing themselves). Naoko, whose mental fragility appears to be part of her appeal to Toru, becomes a modern version of all those doomed nineteenth-century heroines dying of consumption or pining away for love. Of the two novels I must admit that I preferred \\"Sputnik Sweetheart\\", which I felt was not only more imaginative and more original but also considerably less morbid.

0439023521|5.0|This book, in fact the entire series, is so intense and so riveting that I think it's NOT good for very young teens to read it - even though it was written for adolescents and teens The subject matter is gruesome, horrifying and violent, but the writer somehow keeps the main characters from the worst of it. It is a warning of what COULD happen in our country and is similar to what some young people in the world already experience. An excellent read for adults and perhaps an object lesson for us all to keep in mind to prevent something like this from happening in our own country.

Hannah Montana and former Miley albums were closer to rock, or at least pop/rock. \\"Start All Over\\" has a solid, powerful guitar riff. \\"Party In The USA\\" is also a good pop/rock song. \\"Can't be tamed\\" leaves all the rock behind, introducing some pure-pop/electronic music elements. Mixing boxes, computer-based instruments, and it sounds just like Britney or Katy Perry.

B002L3RVCY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the superb animations, action sequences, and decent story lines of this Clone Wars series.  I absolutely loved the movies episodes 4-6, but was quite disappointed with episodes 1-3 and had since accepted that Star Wars would never be as good as I remembered as a child.  However, this series has rekindled that excitement!      In my opinion, these shows are superior to the last three movies released...superior story and even the acting is better.  The movies are 2-D (Episodes 1-3) compared to these cgi works.  Congratulations to the creators who have breathed new life into what had become a dull, flat universe that I had once loved as a kid.  Thank you!

B002EPWTLC|3.0|The show from Royal Albert Hall is wonderful.   But ...  the quality of the DVD is very poor.   I don't mind so much the overall poor clarity, but I do have a problem with about 10 'blips' in the DVD, and then 2 places where the volume greatly increases suddenly.    I ordered 2 replacements to see if the original I received was just a defective copy.   However, all 3 had similar problems.    I did keep one copy since I really like the program - but be warned, the quality of the DVD is not good.    Another point: the titles of the pieces are not displayed (as they are in all other Andre Rieu DVDs).  Seems to be a (poorly) copied DVD?
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Mamma Mia picks you up and almost forces you to smile, laugh, and have fun.  Whether watching it at home with your significant other and a bottle of wine; on an airplane next to some of your closest friends you've never met; by yourself with some tequila; or with a good friend who likes to sing with you, this movie fits for nearly everyone.  Meryl Streep is fabulous.  She bounds, bounces, bellows, sings, and rolls into your heart.  She had so much fun making the movie and it shows.  Her up tempo performance transports you on stage with her.  Pierce Brosnan's horrendous singing brings more mirth and merryment to the experience.  He acts like someone much younger and revels in his inability to sing.  When watching this movie again recently with a friend, we couldn't help but laugh when his character went over the top to try to impress Ms. Streep.  Amanda Seyfried has an amazing voice, especially for someone so young.  And when Ms. Streep and her two friends come out to sing their biggest number, you are going to want to stand up and dance with them.  Yes, it helps if you enjoy Abba music.  You should at least be slightly familiar with some of their biggest hits.  And don't go into it thinking this will be your typical Meryl Streep Oscar-winning, serious role.  This movie is all about having fun.  Hell, if more of us tried to incorporate Abba or other catchy music into our daily lives, we would probably be much happier and laid-back.  So kick back, grab a beverage, cuddle up with your wife or girlfriend -- or watch it by yourself if you want to keep it as your guilty pleasure -- and get ready to launch into a rowdy time.    This review could also be titled, \\"Honey honey, how it thrilled me, uh huh, honey honey!\\"  Or \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme some more Mamma Mia.\\"  Thank god I'm not that corny.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Around the time this came out hip-hop was in about the same state jazz had been in the 1950's and that meaning it was divided into somewhat strict schools. There were instrumental based \\"hip-hop bands\\" such as The Roots,multi instrumentalists such as Pharrell and Timbaland and those who continued to mine the sampladelic store for all it's worth. Kayne,having had years of experience prior to this whith Jay Z and such was long overdue to drop his own album. Musically Kayne gives himself a very big head start by not sticking specifically to any particular hip-hop school but by bringing everything he that inspired him into play in what he did. He layers a lot of samples into his music yes,in particular Curtis Mayfiend,Chaka Khan on \\"Through The Wire\\" for a sound abound in a lot of the trademarks of classic windy city soul such as female backup singers,layered percussion parts. But he brings in a lot of musical ideas all his own not only by employing the string arrangments of Miri Ben Ari and a trio of different guitar/bass players to create something of a rhythm section but also by arranging these select musicians in with the sample layers not to create breaks so much as a genuine musical soundscape that sounds totally cohesive and organic. In fact in most cases you'd be hard pressed listening to this to be able to figure out what is a sample and what is a live instrument,the way it's strung together. Conceptually Kayne is also powerful here. While musically and lyrically this album certainly leaves him with plenty of room for growth and this album does contain plenty of the same profane locker room talk that fuels the fires of hip-hop's many detractors but also contains at least a few double meanings,especially in the albums title which is also played out throught the album in terms of interludes. There's bits of conversation here about how a person can co-opt themselves and their families through too much mental education and not enough real world experience,including dialog about a man who leaves his family nothing but degrees after he dies. It can also be seen as a descriptive term for how R&B,funk and soul is siphoned through hip-hop and the socio-economic conditions surrounding this,all presented in a very witty and topical manner on the simmering funkiness of \\"We Don't Care\\",\\"The New Workout Plan\\" and \\"Spaceship\\" while musing over his religious convictions on the simiarly grooving \\"Jesus Walks\\",paying tribute to all of his musical inspirations via a romantic encounter (in lyrics namedropping Marvin Gaye,Luther Vandross,Minnie Ripperton and the like) on \\"Slow Jamz\\" and closing the album with the hard jamming 10+ minute \\"Last Call\\",in which Kayne tells the story of how his career got started and all the twists and turns he's encountered. This is one of those albums that musically and conceptually reconcilles a lot that once seemed eternally seperate,such as sampling versus live musicianship and profanity versus plainly stated social observation. These things never really were as seperated as they seemed to be but one of the things that did (and does despite personal controversy) define Kayne is how well he is able to express it all with flair and experience for the modern age.ld experience,including dialog about a man who leaves his family nothing but degrees after he dies.

Yet despite all that this is a very good book that I am currently re-reading for more details.  The world is epic and engrossing.  The magic systems are fascinating and leave you wanting to discover more.  The history of the world teases the reader.  I eagerly await the next book in the series.

0545123283|5.0|I raced through this sequel to Shiver. The story continues with Grace enjoying her relationship with Sam, newly cured of his lycanthropy, while Grace's best friend Isabel still grieves over the recent death of her brother. Sam is struggling to deal with the permanence of his new situation, while still worrying over which of his wolf \\"family\\" will return to human form in the spring. In the meantime, a few of the new wolves that Sam's adoptive dad Beck recently created are having troubles. Recovering addict and famous rocker Cole is angry that his wolf change doesn't seem to be sticking... he'd been hoping to escape his human troubles by turning wolf. Cole's friend Victor, unwittingly turned wolf, seems to be having trouble staying in one form.<br /><br />Sam is, in every way, the perfect boyfriend... sensitive, poetic, genuinely thoughtful, undemanding. There is some tension as he's been sneaking into Grace's bedroom every night, not for prurient reasons, but just to snuggle. It isn't explicitly said, but implied, that despite their attraction, their frequent kisses and and despite their absolute rightness for each other, Grace and Sam are probably still virgins. When Grace's parents discover him in their daughter's bed they react with feelings of hurt and rage. They promptly assume the worst and ban Sam from their household, letting Grace know in no uncertain terms how disappointed they are in her. In the meantime, Grace and Sam both feel strongly that they want to get married. I thought this was interesting, because it's plenty common for high school girls to fantasize about marrying their boyfriend... but I'm not sure if young men usually harbor those same thoughts.  Grace, of course, feels embittered that her neglectful parents choose to get involved in her life at this late date.<br /><br />I was a little surprised at how very desperate Grace, and to some extent, Sam, become during their enforced separation. With Grace's 18th birthday only a few months away, they have very little to lose by simply lying low and waiting a little while until they can be together, even without Grace's parents blessing. However, they both feel the pain of separation keenly, and unable to bear even a few days without him, Grace runs away to stay with Sam at Beck's place at the edge of the woods.<br /><br />Linger adds the viewpoints of Cole and Isabel, who play counterpoint to Grace and Sam.  While it's clear that Grace and Sam are meant to be, together forever, soulmates; Cole and Isabel, on the other hand, have a purely animal attraction, lending a dangerous feel to most of their interactions.  Cole questions the whole premise that the change to wolf is caused by cold temperatures... he sees too many exceptions to the rule.<br /><br />I will say that all the foreshadowing in the book in regards to Grace's exposure to a werewolf bite as a girl made the ending totally predictable, but surprisingly I didn't mind.  Even though I knew, pretty much from the second page, where the book was going, I still enjoyed the journey.  There is a cliffhanger, and I am very curious to see where Stiefvater will take us next.le to lose by simply lying low and waiting a little while until they can be together, even without Grace's parents blessing.

B00262G8NS|5.0|God be thanked one hundred thousand times, this Hamlet is not cut up and sliced down to a caricature. It is worth its nearly four hours and we can finally enjoy all the levels of that play. And first of all its wit. Numerous scenes, even the most dramatic, are adorned with gems of wit and jest, humor and fun. No subject is exempt and even death becomes a joke. At times a nostalgic joke, a joke nostalgic of a joke and a jester, like with the skull of Yorick.<br /><br />This production of Hamlet sets an important emphasis on the use of folly, craziness, derangement to create the very tragic plot. We never know whether Hamlet, or Ophelia, or even Laertes are really mad or if they are playing mad. The play is very careful to play on both aspects and possibilities and to make the divide between the two nearly impossible to capture.<br /><br />This production uses very well the potential of the play to make it a real event that can take the dimension of real life. The play in the play is a long episode in which the spectators are playing and the actors are watching and vice versa. Real life becomes the play and the play becomes the mirror of real life. It is so intricate that we wonder if Hamlet is not finding some balance in that juggling game. The play proves he did not find any balance but one supplementary reason to pursue his foolishness.<br /><br />The main core of the play is of course emphasized by the presence of the full dress and adornments of the drama. The king appears all the more guilty when all the details are given, including his own doubts about what he has done, because he doubts he has been able to do it. That brings behind the play a force that is at work in human life all the time: the desire to conquer new territories, if possible from someone close to you. Man is a conqueror, a thief, a bandit, a highwayman, and especially against his own relatives, parents, ascendants and descendants. It is not so much a fight for power but a fight for control. It is not the survival instinct that is at work here but the instinct of possession that can only come with the dispossession of others who end up possessed by the devil of vengeance and the angel of insanity.<br /><br />But the play emphasizes tremendously the nearly all male distribution. Only two female characters: the mother and queen who is the willing/unwilling accomplice of a crime, knows it and enjoys it because it keeps her on the throne. She is called all kinds of abusive names that she deserves from beginning to end. Ophelia is the second woman and she is both the center of the play but nothing but a prop used when necessary. The target of insults and verbal aggression from Hamlet. The illustration of female derangement finding its voice in the language of flowers. The dead suicidee in a tomb causing the anger of the clergy, the  craze of her brother Laertes and the violent intervention  of Hamlet. It is a play that rejects women as being at best the profiteers of what men are doing, and at worst their victims.<br /><br />But this brings a whole different line of questioning. In that all-male universe what can happen? An all-male universe is a pot full of spiders and they have to kill one another to the last, and there is no survivor in the pot that will be taken over by a spider coming from outside when all the killing is done. Shakespeare adds to that the fact that this chaotic spider war is always started by some gross irregular action of one of these men to conquer the territory he does not control. The disruptive act here is double: the killing of a king by his own brother and the marrying of the widowed queen by this aforesaid brother. The first consequence is that the proper heir is rejected into some kind of death sooner or later to clear the way to the new usurping king.<br /><br />The last characteristic is that the play is always bringing together men, friends and more friends and among all these friends there are some real friends and the play is quite careful not to introduce any ambiguity on that subject. The only real embrace between Hamlet and Horatio is when Hamlet is dying in Horatio's arms. This production is careful to disarm some of the wit that could be ambiguous with a wink or a small detail or inflection. Even the two traitors known as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern who are inseparable and are like direct gambling and night time pleasure revelers for Hamlet himself, those two with their obvious Jewish names, predestined names, one to be a death garland and the other nothing but a surface of gold to hide the rest, even them are nicely over-painted as cruel and uncaring people who are ready to take anyone, even their professed friends to the scaffold.<br /><br />But, one more time, all this could not be if the play were reduced by one third as is the case in mot production. Our modern audiences are supposed to be in a hurry and they do not have four hours to spend for only one play, two maybe but not one.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDy on that subject.

0316069485|5.0|One of Connelly's best. I have been following Bosch through the years, and if you have, you won't be disappointed with the quick references to previous stories. By putting Mickey and Harry in situations that were out of their comfort zone, kept you interested to see what happened next.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|This is a good movie, the story line was a believable story line of something that could happen, no beaming people on and off planets or super warp speed etc, just simple sci fi tech, starting about 200 years in the future, long space travel times traveling with a nuclear powerplant, and oh yes, all this brought about due to the earth pretty much overcrowded and wars erupting over dwindling resources,...so they need to colonize another planet in a far distance and send out this ship.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but I will say the movie is in my oninion very good, I have seen many many other movies that just plainly suck/stink/have fancy cover art to sell, and this one made me nervious at first when I saw the box, ya know, fancy box and cover art, very nice, but I was not disappointed. The two main actors pull off a very good performance, as usual.  A twist ending that is sure to not let you down, I assure you.  Now, my need not to give a spoiler though is overriding what is essential to these reviews on amazon that clear up things others have missed, which is some have noticed that several of our main charactors are doing things that seem superhuman and unbelievable, but I noticed that too and watched the movie a second time.  **DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT A SPOILER**Remember, everyone in cryo sleep was given an \\"enzyme\\" to jump start evolution on a new planet, to help them adapt to the new environment on a distant planet, well everyone in cryo sleep got that, for a.....no spoiler by me.....amount of time, .. though when you read all through other reviews you get an almost complete picture of the movie.    Oh, and by the way, I was impressed with the sets and humanoid creature effects, very good, I am sure it couldn't have been a rock bottom budget.  Oh, and by the way, that was \\"60,000\\" colonists sent, not \\"16,000\\" colonists, to help others out, seems in the movie, several folks said something that sounded like sixteen thousand, but it was actually 60,000 that were originally sleeping.

B003W5C0VW|4.0|One of the nicest results of this year's \\"Exilemania,\\" this is the first time \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\" has been released on DVD. This is an early 1970s concert film capturing the Rolling Stones as they promote their then-new double LP \\"Exile on Main Street.\\" There are a lot of joys and surprises in this video, many of which include the relative youth and vitality of both Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Jagger sings like he really means it, and Richards seems thoroughly entranced by the rhythm riffs he's playing to goad the band on. The stage is too small to allow for the type of posturing and posing that the latter-day Stones are known for, the backup musicians are relatively few in number, and the setlist includes mainly songs from the Rolling Stones' last 3 LPs. Can you imagine such a thing today?    There's also a lot of space in these songs for then-lead guitarist Mick Taylor to really shine. Guitarists are going to want to watch his hands very closely, and pay close attention to his fluid blues-and-jazz based leads. This is a texture that's sorely missing from the modern Rolling Stones. It's also more than a little disconcerting to see how little fun Taylor seems to be having onstage; he looks almost like a bored sideman even during his glorious solos on \\"Love in Vain!\\"    This is an early 1970s rock film and at times it shows. It definitely does not look like a contemporary 3-camera/direct-to-cable TV setup. It looks more like a documentary. Scenes are sometimes out of focus, and the director sometimes points the camera in exactly the opposite place you'd like it to be. (Thankfully we don't have the sort of extreme zooms that were also popular in concert films of the time.) The screen is oftentimes dark, because the stage lighting at the time was intentionally moody. I've seen better-looking concerts from this period, but I've also seen far, far worse and the picture quality is certainly acceptable. The sound, to my ears, is amazingly good.    Given that this was a theatrically-released concert film (and closely aligned to \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" the Rolling Stones give us more extras than we're used to on their concert discs. There are two interviews with Mick Jagger, which really don't reveal much about the film that we can't see with our own eyes. There are also some rehearsal scenes. There could have been a lot more included, though, and it's irritating that the Stones reserved a second disc full of extras to an expensive boxed set rather than just releasing a 2-DVD set. Such is life, I suppose.    If you count yourself as a true Rolling Stones fan from their early 1970s era, you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD. It's well-worth seeing again and again.
B001HN694K|2.0|I wish this film would have been more pyscadelic and trippy and less violent and boring.  I think they should have left out the battle sequence with the jaborwocky.  It reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings.  The only character I found interesting was Helena Bonham's character as the red queen.  Anne Hathaway totally overacted as the white queen and Johnny Depp was annoying as usual.  How could you mess up Alice in Wonderland?  It's not rocket science people.

It is a must read for anyone that has or cares for children.I wont give the story away but one part made me cringe with fear when reading it.I found myself holding my breath. The view of the child is so real that you become him when you are reading this book. To the writer, we all would like to know how Jack did when he grew up. I recomend this book.  Only start it if you have time to finish it, it will take over all your thoughts until you are done.

Children may enjoy it more than adults. On the other hand, Johnny Depp's performance was a little creepy (ok, a lot creepy), and that may or may not disturb kids more than adults! All in all an average okay movie.
0385738757|3.0|I don't know how to rate this book. I do know that this book pushed me over the edge to keep my promise NOT to read trilogies until all three books are published.    James is a good writer.    That said, I had a hard time with this story. I knew it wouldn't be easy on the youth who had escaped the Maze. But they never seemed to get a break. They had a day here and there of easiness before James plunged us into another terrible situation.  He made sure the reader didn't know who to trust which is frustrating. The whole time I kept hoping they would get help/food/out.  This book is way more brutal than Maze Runner.   It drove me crazy that they knew who was doing this to them but they couldn't get out. They couldn't do anything to help themselves except get to the place they were told to go. One time WICKED even intervened.  The tats were as big of a deal as I thought they would be.  Thomas is amazing how he just keeps moving forward.  I did skim ALOT in this book. There was a ton of internal dumping (it felt like anyway).  I can't decide if I want to read the next one.  *sigh* But I will! I'll do it for James because he is awesomesauce.    Rating: PG 17  V: Yes.

Now you tell me, how could i not love this album... nuff said.. Rock on.
1400095204|5.0|Wow! This is a book I will not forget : so beautifully written, such masterful style, so believable.<br /><br />The story takes place at a particularly terrible time in the history of Nigeria, but the story is so gripping that to read it is a huge pleasure. What I particularly liked was that the author did not adopt the omniscient narrator's voice. This allows each of the three major characters, as well as the other principal people in the story, to be totally believable : they are real people with motivations and ways of acting that are not explained away by the wave of a godlike hand. Ugwu, Odenigbo, Olanna; Kainene, Richard ... all equally fascinating. Time spent with these characters during the reading is really enriching; I really cared about what happened to each single one.<br /><br />Add to that the brilliant construction which makes you want to keep turning the pages to confirm your hunches or refute them; the small clues, the little signs, the lack of over dramatisation and the consummate writing skill that Chimamanda displays : you will not regret reading this novel, and, like me, you will surely be sad when it finishes.
B003ASLJS6|4.0|Pale rider is another one of Clint's spaghetti westerns, but this one is of a more serious demeanor. Good ole time movie.

1416550550|5.0|Ms. Morton is a great storyteller! The beginning of the book was hard to wade through only because I hadn't been properly introduced to the three women who would tell the story of the forgotten garden. Each chapter is told from a different perspective and era but each story is woven together and at the end, all loose strings are tucked neatly together.  We have a woman who eloped with a commoner and ended up poor with a pair of twins.  The woman's daughter is discovered and taken back to the mansion to live with her aunt, uncle and girl cousin. The two become inseparable, much to the dislike of the aunt.  The cousin's child disappears and ends up in another country, raised by the port master and family. Her adoptive father doesn't tell her until she is 21. She suddenly feels she is not who she thought and goes on a search of who she is. She dies and her granddaughter takes over to solve the mystery.  And Ms. Morton will keep you guessing throughout the whole book. But the story is so engaging and beautifully written the reader won't mind waiting until the end.  I must confess I guess the outcome but there were many, many red herrings thrown in that I was kept off track until the end.  There are over 500 pages in this book and they are all worth reading.      Rating PG  V: None  S: None  L: None

0312600844|1.0|My book club selected this book because we'd never read an Oprah pick before and thought we'd give it a try. We shouldn't have bothered. This book was lengthy and pretentious. None of the characters were remotely likeable or seemingly real. While we could find things to discuss, it was not an enjoyable read. I read fiction for fun and this was in no way a fun read. I think he tried too hard to represent the banality and dysfunctional nature of each household within suburban society. While he succeeded somewhat in that, it cost the reader a slog through the inner workings of uninteresting characters.
B003NWS5AO|3.0|but I'm not sure what. It's quite good, just not what I wanted, which doesn't make it bad, of course. Maybe youtube some clips first instead of buying it in pure faith that it will rock your world, like I did.
B001HN69B8|5.0|I'm writing this as a tear rolls down my cheek and the credits roll across the screen after having just viewed this film.  Before seeing it, I read most the reviews out here and I'm glad I did.  Any review of this film giving praise are the only reviews, in my opinion, which are worthy of note.  Anyone who gives a negative review has no appreciation for art, very little imagination, nor much respect for the film crew.  I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for everyone to continue work on this after having lost a dear friend and inspiration...    So, the reason I cried at the end of this film is not because it is so sad, but because we have tragically lost, very likely, the most talented actor in our lifetime.  Having said that, I would like to segue this review into talking about Terry Gillian.  I cannot think of a film Terry has done that I do not like.  I'm a huge fan.  In the first scene where the camera steps into the Imaginarium, I am reminded how Terry would have made a great choice for doing a J.R.R. Tolkien story.  The landscapes, the sounds, the story lines, and the characters Terry puts together are so fantastical and rich in art that we are very lucky to have Mr. Gilliam entertain us.    Without going into any details regarding the story line, I will say this... it strikes chords within us that stretch themes and characters from ancient time into modern struggles and scenery.  The whole crew was amazing.  The acting was amazing, the wardrobe was amazing, the stages were amazing, the makeup was amazing, the sounds were amazing, and the graphic art was amazing. It's been a long time since I enjoyed a film this good.  I hope you enjoy it too.  This is a no brainer 5 star film for me, and a wonderful tribute to the late great Heath Ledger.  I will undoubtedly watch this film several more times!

1401396135|5.0|A great yarn!  I read/listen to books on audio while I drive.  I hated having to turn the car off.  In addition to the good mystery twists and turns, you have to love the comedic flair that is consistent with the TV show.  I only wish the audio book had been available in MP3 disk format.
1439133948|3.0|I'm a longtime Bujold fan (more like passionate devotee), but this was not up to her usual standards.  If I didn't love Miles so much, I don't think I would have stuck with it.  Listening to Roic's constant internal conversations made me roll my eyes, and the one-dimensional kids and the pet-caretaking (!) felt sterile and Disneyfied.  Raven has got to be the least interesting character in the whole series.  I can't believe Miles didn't go crazy with boredom.  Why does this happen to every character who gets married and hits 40?  Please, Lois, give us middle-agers some hope that the zaniness of life endures.    It is true that the end drabbles redeem a lot.  But I found the prior hundreds of pages all the more disappointing by comparison.

B003XRZZFM|5.0|I know some people have not like them since Stormblast, and I read in places that they have lost their   Black Metal roots.  Weather they are 'true' Black Metal or not, for me I couldn't care less - this album is fantastic in whatever Metal Genre you want to put them in. The sound on this is brilliant and having an entire symphony only enhances the atmosphere that Dimmu have created.  Galder is so underrated as a guitarist and Shagrath has really taken his vocals up to another notch.  I would say this album is probably closer to Death Cult Armageddon in terms of it's Symphonic Metal sound but I think this one is even more polished in terms of production.  Dimmu have not limited itself to the sounds of old school black metal and seem to enjoy trying different musical approaches and that is the one thing I love about this band. I am not sure if this review encourages you to purchase this album but if like me, you are a fan of Dimmu Borgir already, chances  are you will purchase this anyway.  A great album and a worthy addition to your Metal collection !!!!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Sure this movie may seem easy to follow and easy to guess what they might say but that does not make a movie bad at all.  This movie has great acting and a great story.  Also as my last point of this movie...the graphics are awesome.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|AMD phenom X6 1055T overclocked to 3.5ghz... was running around 43-50 celcius consistently on stock cooler. LOUD.<br /><br />Installed CM 212+ and now it runs at a consistent 35 degrees. Solid. And AMAZINGLY QUIET.<br /><br />Quite HUGE and takes a bit of time to install but it got in. I have a CM690 Advanced II and a Gigabyte GA-8701-UD3. Fits perfectly. I already had the exact same PWM fan that came with it, so I attached it to the other side of the heatsink to create a push-pull airflow.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/6/2012:<br />After almost a year and 2 months with this baby, I have to admit it is probably the BEST upgrade I have made to my build (outside of my SSD of course, but this had much better value :). My desktop runs cool at all times, and the 2 fans I have attached never go over 900 RPM. The general HIGH temperature in my desktop is around 38 C. Not to mention it has increased the airflow over everything in my tower. So all is well with this guy still running.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|I'm being generous with this Blair Witch Project knock off. When I saw the description of the movie I thought it might be a good \\"B\\" thriller to pass an evening away.     I think they could have done so much more with this movie. The creepiest parts of the movie were really just her standing over her boyfriend for a couple of hours at night and being dragged down the hall into the darkness. The rest of the movie really just relied on startling the audience. Any movie where a viewer is expecting something profound to happen is waiting for those creepy scary moments when the popcorn goes flying. Just startling an audience doesn't make a good movie. I gave it three stars because conceptually it was a good idea for people that like scary movies. I laughed through the movie which wasn't what I was expecting and unlike some friends who had to sleep with the lights on for a few nights, I turned mine off. I say watch it and if you know it's a \\"B\\" movie with a cult following it's OK. I probably won't watch the second one.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|It had been a long time since I saw Superman--The Movie. Upon seeing it again, I was reminded why I enjoyed it so much. Rarely is the casting of a movie perfect, such as Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, and Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman. Mr. Reeve's performance as directed by Richard Donner is perfect, as is the work by the cast of both well-known and not as well-known actors. My only complaint in an otherwise near flawless movie would be near the end when after the nuclear missle hits the San Andreas fault and Superman tries to restore all the earthquake damage, he goes to Hoover Dam and just after the dam shatters and water pours out, he shoves boulders into the way of the flooding water. The problem is that its quite obvious that the town he saves is a miniature probably built from model kits from a model railroading store. With all the money spent on the movie, couldn't they have done better with this sequence? But overall, I see Superman--The Movie as one of the great love stories in the movies. In order to save the woman he loves, he disobeys his Prime Directive of never altering the course of human destiny and reverses time to save her! How many of us wouldn't want to do that?    This four disc set also has some animated cartoons made by the Fleischer Brothers in the early 1940's. These shorts have extensive art-deco detail and move at a breakneck pace--just action, action, action! Also included in the disc set was \\"Superman and the Mole-Men\\" (1951). It starred the t.v. Superman of the time, George Reeves, and is (for the budget they had to work with) very good. My only complaint being that even though most of the story takes place at night, the exterior scenes are far too well lit to effectively be considered as being \\"night\\" unless the story took place in the high northern latitudes where the midnight sun would illuminate the sky.    Included in the disc set are deleted scenes from Superman--The Movie, and as is the case for many deleted scenes in movies, it's easy to see why they weren't included in the final cut of the movie.

B001AEF6D6|5.0|DVD was brand new, so it was in great condition. Seller shipped the item in a very timely manner.  I was surprised to receive it when I did.
030726999X|4.0|I have to say the most critical thing I have to say is that the story ends with this book.  The ending was very emotional to me.  Lisbeth is such a strong character that you want to follow her and make she she suceeds and figures her life out.  If you've invested time in the first two books, then this is an absolute must read.  This is one of, if not the best written series I've ever read.
0525421580|1.0|I threw the book away when I finished reading it. That is how much I disliked it. I didn't even think it was worth giving away to someone else! I was a fan of John Green and had previously read Paper Towns, The Abundance of Katherine's and Let It Snow. But this book was crude to the point of pointlessness.     I am not sure what the author's intentions were exactly. They obviously wish their readers to be supportive of the homosexuality, and yet, the author's themselves paint the gay characters in the books as being somewhat psychotic and emotionally unbalanced. Not a very kindly depiction. I do not dislike gay people, just for clarity's sake. I just felt uncomfortable with the authors descriptions.     The book, because it was written by two authors (Levithan and Green) was missing some cohesive elements in the writing that was apparent in Green's other collaborative work--Let It Snow. Even the character's themselves were poorly constructed. I felt as if they weren't fully developed characters because we jumped around so frequently between the lives and the worlds of the two Will Grayson's.    If you're a John Green fan, don't buy the book! Pick it up at your local library, read the first two chapters, and put it back on the library shelf. Then, leave the library knowing that you didn't waste your time or money towards this book like I did...
B003DT19F0|5.0|We watched this movie with our 2 granddaughters, ages 3 and 22 months.  We all enjoyed it immensely and I'm glad I actually purchased it, because we'll watch it over and over!!  Very cute story.
B003YP7N9O|1.0|What exactly is the point of this release ? If you're a Tull fan , you pretty much have everything on here . If you have the Cigar Box boxed set you have the Carnegie Hall concert with the exception of Dharma for One and By Kind Permission Of ..which you also have if own Living In The Past . If you have the remastered version of Stand Up you already have the material on this disc ...even the 'bonus tracks ' which were all part of the original Living In The Past anyway ..except for 17 which you also already have if you own the first boxed set .<br />And the Carnegie Hall Concert DVD has no video ?<br />The only new material on here from what I can see are 4 BBC tracks .<br />The first reviewer seems to be excited about the 'complete ' version of 17 which is 3:07 * ..the same running time on the boxed set version . He also seems very willing to dismiss This Was - heresy in my book .<br />I hate to trash anything Tull puts out , they're my favorite band ...but what exactly is the point of this release ?<br />4 BBC tracks , a remastered 17 and studio banter ?<br />..btw , 5 stars to the original Stand Up lp  and having trashed this thing ....I'll probably buy it anyway<br /><br />* I stand corrected on 17 ..one other reviewer has it as 6 minutes +
B002ZG98Z0|3.0|I love Sex and the City but the second movie could have been better, what i liked about it was the wedding, the outfits and the last 10 minutes of the movie. It was still ok but while watching it I felt like you were waiting and waiting on the climax to happen. it could have been more, of course they are married with kids but it made them seem married and boring. And Mr. Biggs he was not doing it for me in the second movie and Mr. Biggs always does it for me.
B0030Y11O2|5.0|This was one Awesome Movie, although it starts with some sad stuff , it shows how bad our system really is but after the first 30 minutes I dont think I ever stopped laughing
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I had heard of this picture some time before actually seeing it for the first time, which was yesterday.  It's powerful in a sneak-up-on-you kind of way, sensitive without being smarmy, and sensuous without being lascivious (although there are times ... lol).  A beautifully rendered, fresh realization of the Beatles' music, woven into a resonant, cohesive story.  Highly recommended for virtually anyone.
B003TVMIDO|5.0|The remastered albums sound really nice.  Just as for the Beatles remastered box sets, I am hearing bits I've never heard before...  The packaging is quite nice, although I find the actual box is a bit too big for what was needed.  I also think they could have been more generous on home demo and unreleased material (there is such an enormous amount available) and they could have included the stripped down version of Double Fantasy.  But the box set definitely delivers on what you expect from remastered versions.  Well done, Yoko!
B002ZG98LO|4.0|Love this new take on Predator entertaining and action worthy. Lawerence Fishbure's character really crazy that one hehehe. but I truly enjoyed the ending hope there is another one.

B003L20IFG|4.0|A man wakes up to find himself in the dark, trapped in a small space like a coffin. All he can find is a lighter and a cell phone. And the cell phone's battery is running very low and is likely to be out of power at any moment. Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds) is the man, an American truck river who is literally buried alive. In this riveting thriller Paul tries to figure out how to contact the right person to get a help before it is too late.    The thrilling film is an admirable feat on the part of the scriptwriter Chris Sparling and the director Rodrigo Cortés. They refuse to rely on familiar narrative devices such as flashbacks, making the viewers share the same claustrophobic experiences of being trapped in a wooden box. It is like reading an Edgar Allan Poe short story, a well-told tale of terror that grabs your attention instantly and never lets go.    But the real star of the suspenseful film is of course Ryan Reynolds as the buried man. Unique as it is, the film's claustrophobic premise is a tricky thing to get right without capable actors, but his excellent performance almost single-handedly carries the film, of which camera consists of close ups and middle shots. His acting is effective, even in the film's darkly funny moments.    The 95 minute thriller is based on a simple concept (one man, one set), brilliantly executed by the entire cast (voices and sound effects play significant roles to enhance the suspense). Like some of the recent Spanish films (\\"The Orphanage\\" \\"The Others\\" and many others), Rodrigo Cortés's \\"Buried\\" is a gripping thriller with originality.
6300215881|3.0|One-Eyed Jacks, 1961 film    The story begins in 1880 Sonora Mexico. Men are robbing a bank. They leave as if nothing happened. These three arrive at another town; one walks away to visit a girl. Pursuers arrive in town and search local bordello. One man makes a daring mistake, and warns the other. They are chased and surrounded. Dan will ride to find fresh horses and return. But he decides against this risk, and his partner Rio is captured. Five years later two men escape from prison. Rio searches for Dan Longworth. In one bar he meets a man who needs help to rob a bank where Dan is now sheriff. The four men ride to Monterey California. Rio finds Longworth at home. Dan tells a story about his failure to return; Rio knows the truth. Rio tells a story too.    There will be a fiesta tomorrow, everything will be closed. Rio makes his plans about the bank. The sheriff advises them to leave town afterwards. Rio walks with Louisa. The people have fun. Rio tells a story to Louisa, and gives her a necklace. [Didn't her mother warn her?] The next morning he tells her the truth. [Isn't that out of character?] The Deputy talks to Dan about Louisa and Rio. There is drama here. There is conflict in the tavern but it is ironed out. The sheriff shows up. \\"He was asking for it.\\" Rio is arrested and whipped. He is put on a horse and driven out of town. They rest at a small ranch far out of town. Rio heals over time, and practices shooting his pistol. Louisa rides out to visit Rio. [Does Rio talk too much?] There is conflict among the four robbers. [Boredom?] Three men ride off, but one falls from his horse.    There is a bank holdup by two men. One robber is shot, so is the teller and a young girl. The other robber escaped. The Deputy tells the sheriff, who was not in town. Rio is captured and brought into town, an angry mob greets him. [Rio is short on luck.] Rio will get a fair trial and them be hanged. Louisa visits Rio in jail. Will this change things? Yes, and there is more action and drama. Will there be a happy ending for Louisa and Rio? [Not likely.]    This is an average drama that is at least 35 minutes too long. Editing would allow a faster moving film. The story could be better. No mention about the robber who got the gold.
B0009F2EPU|5.0|This Ring Cycle is well known to opera fans and scholars.  I need not add anything in detail to the volumes aready written about the production's artistic merit. But I do want to say that my DVDs arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  It is a revelation all over again.  Infinitely superior, in my view, to recent new productions in Los Angeles and New York.  Intelligent story telling and superb casting.  Boulez was maligned but I don't hear it.  To my way of thinking this is very much worth the purchase price.
0061353248|1.0|I think the book is interesting.  The author gives a bunch of cool examples of when we make decisions that do not seem rational.  However, he goes too far and tries to spread his conclusions to everything else.  He essentially thinks that we are all stupid and thus he wants the government to be larger and in charge of making more decisions for us since they know better.  I mean, really?  Just because some people buy an expensive $4 cup of coffee at Starbucks he now thinks the govt should be deciding things for us (as if they have a superior power to never be anchored incorrectly).     So, the book is interesting for the examples, but not for the economic theory.  He is just not a good economist, though he seems to be a good observant.  For example, he states that doubling taxes on goods would not make a difference and fails to think 1) that we have to allocate scare resources when we make decisions and that they are not made in a vacuum unlike his little experiments 2) neglects to think about all the other influences and prices that affect behavior outside of the lab room 3) that normal people some times do think about what they are doing and change their behavior.    His extrapolates interesting examples into broader definitions which do not make sense and he fails to evaluate his examples a bit more.  I.e., when he talks about how some students would pay to listen to him recite poetry while others would pay him depending on what anchor he had set, he forgets to mention that he is also suggesting this anchor in a position of authority and trust.     Yes, some times we do make irrational decisions, especially in one off situations, but he just fails to see how that applies to a larger economy with many participant and many choices.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Although I wasn't around in the '60s (or the '70s, for that matter), I have become a huge Beatles fan, and personally, I find this CD to be PERFECT. A lot of people have complained that it doesn't include particular songs, and doesn't cover the group's career that well. But you have to understand that the purpose of this CD is to present a collection of the group's #1 U.S. and U.K. hits, not a comprehensive overview of their career.<br />To me, this has to be the most monumental CD in the history of CDs.<br />Not one song here is a dog (something that is also true of most of the rest of the Beatles' catalog). Every one is an absolute essential, and it's incredible to have all of them in one place.<br />(By the way, for those of you who wonder why \\"Please Please Me\\" isn't here, I might have the explanation for that. I have read that there was --- at one point anyway --- some dispute over whether it was actually a #1. Seems that at the time it first came out, there was more than one record chart in the U.K., and the one that is now the most widely quoted had it at #2. Apparently, it has been decided that it was NOT actually a #1. As to why \\"Strawberry Fields\\" wasn't included, I have no idea. But the exclusion of those songs isn't a problem for me.)<br />Something I REALLY don't get is how anyone could knock the sound quality of this CD. Maybe it's my ears, or my equipment (or both), but it sounds super to me. It seems to me that the engineers did a terrific remastering job with these songs, and I don't see how anyone could disagree that the sound on this CD BLOWS AWAY the sound on old vinyl records (and yes, I have heard old vinyl records). It even sounds better than the group's CD album reissues (well, better than the reissues that came out in the '80s, anyway).<br />A lot of these songs weren't on the \\"regular\\" albums, and a couple of them were on an album but in considerably different versions, which to me makes this CD that much greater.<br />Some old fans of thegroup (i.e., ones who were around in the '60s) may be put off by the fact that most of the songs that were released in mono on the original singles are in stereo here, but to me, the fact that they are in stereo is yet another thing that contributes to the greatness of this CD. Maybe it's because I came into the world during the period where stereo mixes were (and are) the \\"standard\\" for recordings, but I'm not as hostile toward the idea of old recordings being reissued in stereo instead of mono as some people are. If a stereo mix sounds as good to me as these do, I'll take it over a mono mix any day.<br />I honestly can't think of anything negative to say about this CD. Other folks can criticize this CD all they want, but none of their gripes will change my mind. If I had to give up every CD in my vast collection but one, this is the one (or should that be the \\"1\\"?) I'd keep.<br />(By the way, if it's a comprehensive overview of the Beatles' career that you're looking for, the Red and Blue albums serve that purpose quite nicely, at least in my opinion --- though the Red album is still two CDs, and is still often overpriced.)
B003WSFXKY|1.0|Being a musician, guitar player, I love Carlos Santana, have been a huge fan for the past 30 years. This album sounds like it was recorded in a day, with the studio band from a bad sitcom. The Production is horrible, A lot of it sounds the same and is so commercial it is embarrassing. The concept of \\"Supernatural\\" and a lot of other artists doing compilations is great! That was well produced, thought out CD, loved it, this on the other hand is horrific. I never write reviews, especially being a musician, but This is a CRIME!
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is fantastic. I am a fan of the books, and while I was afraid that Cera as Pilgrim would lead to a movie suckfest... this movie blew me away, and I saw it 5 times in theatres before being low enough on money to decide to wait for it to come to the cheap theatre (never did) and come out on DVD. As soon as it popped up on here, I pre-ordered it. It is stunning- not gimmicky, it is supposed to be flashy and crazy and fun, like a video game, and like all the little things in manga- come to life. It could totally thrive on its own, but it just wouldn't be Scott Pilgrim without the vibe- it makes fun of itself, and it has fun. Which means you have fun. It just doesn't fail.<br /><br />And the musiccc. I love the music. Amazing soundtrack... and movie versions of some of the soundtrack songs.<br /><br />Just. everything about this movie is perfect. Except, the ending- which is different from the books since the last book wasn't out when the book was filmed- made me sad. Which isn't a flaw, so much as personal preference. They really make Ramona kind of pathetic and not very likable. ): And I love her. But, that's okay. The movie was awesome.<br /><br />I'm so glad they made the books into a movie, and into this movie, because this movie is fantastic and the ONLY movie I've ever seen more than twice in theatres... and one of about... 3 movies that I've watched more than once in theatres.<br /><br />Scott Pilgrim, all the way. -love- :D<br /><br />Can't wait to get my Blu-ray combo pack tomorrowwww~~~<br />And, I'll edit this to include the awesome quality of it then. ;)
B000006MS3|5.0|I have been looking for this CD in stores forever. Then I decided to try Amazon for the first time. I was amazed that it was there.It was a used CD but said \\"good condition.\\" I was afraid it would be scratched. It was perfect! It looked brand new except for no plastc wrap over it. The quality was excellent. Not only that, it came to me in the mail in 3 Days! I am so happy. I will use Amazon for most of my purchases.
B002ZG9968|3.0|Crude?  I agree, it was crude in places, especially the 3 year old breast feeding and the woman giving birth.  Other parts were somewhat laughable as far as what women go through being pregnant.  If you can't laugh about what it does to your body, let's face it, you'll just cry and be depressed.  Same with having kids.  The awful and the wonderful, and even when they're grown, it's the same story.<br /><br />Lopez wasn't her best, I agree.  She seemed to be floating throughout the story with no real depth, but that's probably because the movie wasn't real deep either.  $3.99 on demand was a fair price for a few hours.<br /><br />However, the better twist to the story would have been her boyfriend was the sperm donor.  That would have made it far more heartfelt knowing the children were really his.  What would be the possibilities?  Endless.
B000P0J024|5.0|Got it for my mother for her birthday. It arrived 2 days before schedule and she loved it. She said it was exactly what she wanted!
B000063UR2|1.0|This version was horrible, her singing and the score made it that way. Had I know, I wouldn't have gotten it. It sounds like a Disney movie or a Steven Spielberg movie (although his are awesome, the music made this movie suck). I like the theatrical version a 100 time more, this version was totally ruined by the score and the singing. There's a reason that this version didn't make it to theaters.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie shows how a woman with what society classes a 'disability', has become a leading expert in her chosen field.  Clare Danes is magnificent as Temple - and the supporting roles are noteworthy.  This movie barely raised a ripple in Australia - however, as I was aware of Temple Grandin and her work with cattle, made it a 'must see' and I'm SO glad I did.  It deservedly won awards - it is a movie that I thoroughly recommend you watch - if only to see what determination in the face of adversity can achieve!!  5 Stars!!!!!
1439133948|4.0|Miles has killed people. Miles has seen people die. Miles has even died. And yet, Miles has not quite ever faced death as squarely as he does in Cryoburn.    There is a mystery/action thriller plot, but the whole time the plot seems like a distraction. This is because what is really being explored here is actually the cycle of life and death. Why do people cling to life? Why do we have all these complicated feelings and fears about death, when (as Bujold points out) we were just as non-alive before our lives began?    It's one thing to flash-freeze a trauma victim in order to hopefully surgically repair him sometime later, as once happened to Miles. It's something entirely different to freeze a very old person, in the hope that someday a \\"cure\\" will be found for aging. Aging and death are natural, but so what? Diseases are natural, and we fight them as hard as we can. But is being frozen really a better solution than just dying? And when people opt to get themselves frozen at younger and younger ages, so that there will be the best chance for them when (or if) they get revived, what sort of a trade is being made between the life we have now and the chance for some future life?    Of course this has religious overtones as well, but Bujold barely acknowledges them in passing, preferring to concentrate on the effects of these questions on society and science.    Bujold counters all these thoughts of death by also featuring some characters (even viewpoint characters) who are very young, and seeing a completely different side of life. I wonder what the book would have been like if the 11-year-old Jin had been the sole point of view character? But Miles is a greedy sort, and he would never allow a book he was in to be told entirely from someone else's point of view.    The book is very good, and very Bujold, but it doesn't quite have the \\"firing on all cylinders\\" feel that her very best novels exude. I think this is because a little too much of the book is taken up by theplot, even though the plot is probably the least interesting thing in the book.
B002ZG98XW|5.0|The genius of this movie is it's ability to create and maintain suspense - even when you know what happened!  (Like \\"Apolla 13\\"!)      The cast was superb - Diane Lane is always fine, but this role is her supreme achievement.  John Malkovich was at his irascible best.      I will own this movie and watch it repeatedly when I need encouragement.      Heart and spirit, the will to win - all delivered without boring didacticism.  Great movie.  Great movie.  Great movie.
1439177783|5.0|I read this on my kindle and I did not give any thought ahead of time to photos in the book. If so, I might have opted for the print version, but as it turns out the kindle version was very powerful. The way Portia arranges the photos with the story is just genius. I highly recommend the book and I have to say it was one of the best I've read on my kindle so far. Because you don't tend to peruse the whole book ahead of time on your kindle, the arrangement takes you completely by surprise.<br /><br />This book is really well written and I hope it isn't the last we see of Portia De Rossi as an author.<br /><br />I read a lot of books but I don't tend to pay much attention to Hollywood tell alls or stories of eating disorders. I also Tivo Ellen every day and generally appreciate her opinion on arts and entertainment. As down right adorable as it was to see her gushing all over Portia on her show (\\"I'm not saying I'm perfect.\\" \\"I think you're perfect\\") I just did not buy that this book would really be something I'd enjoy.<br /><br />I downloaded the sample on my kindle and I was hooked. I can't stop thinking or talking about the story Portia weaves. I can't say enough about the high quality of the writing here.<br /><br />I hope Portia continues to explore her authentic self and I hope she continues to write.

B00004TR2G|4.0|I am giving this disc 4 stars and not 5. I will give my reasons shortly. But let me clear up a few things for people considering buying this disc.    First off: You should buy it, no doubt about it.    I have a very expensive high resolution \\"audio only\\" reference system. It has the capability of producing a full range majestic sound stage if the recording has the chops.    This re-master of Jaws has the chops. The 24 bit re-master is superb. I hear a real orchestra with depth, clarity, delineation of instruments, accurate timbre and real dynamics. As far as quality of recording, on this disc we are hearing Jaws with more clarity than we are likely to ever get.    Secondly: Don't be confused. This is the \\"actual\\" music from the \\"movie.\\" This is the music that played \\"in the movie,\\" the \\"actual\\" music, not a reinterpretation of the themes. So what you hear on this disc is exactly what you will hear if you throw on the DVD and watch it. It is a pleasure to finally hear this music that till now has never been available on CD.     Some wonderful musical moments from the movie that were never presented on the MCA disc are finally here on this Decca release. One of my favorites is,     \\"Into the Estuary\\" This is the music that compliments the attack on the son of Brody that is playing in the \\"pond\\" which is believed to be a safe body of water separated from the ocean. This is the moment we first get a glimpse of the massive size of the shark as it grabs a man in a tiny row boat and pulls him into the depths. The cue ends with Brody looking out at the dark and mysterious sea after pulling his son from the water who lies safe, but in shock at his feet. The music swells and emphasizes the ominous power of nature and how small man is before its movements and Brody's mounting desire to hunt the shark.    Now my gripes and why I can not give this disc 5 stars:    Gripe 1: The cues/cuts on this disc are not in the order they appeared in the film. So you can't throw the disc on,close your eyes and relive the movie. John Williams decided to put the songs in an order that would create a complete orchestral suite of sorts. But in my opinion he did not succeed. He should have left well enough alone and simply put the cuts in the proper order so we could relive the movie through the music. This is a small gripe as it is easy to rip the disc and reorder it, but why should I have to do that?    Gripe 2: John Williams did a wonderful thing, he made that incredible MCA reinterpretation re-orchestration of the movie cues, and it is amazing as many of you know. The original MCA CD is not the music \\"in the movie\\" it is the music of the movie transformed by John into 12 full size, glorious, full bore, take no prisoners, orchestral works. These are original and unique arrangements of the main cues of the movie, and they are powerful.     MCA vs. Decca comparison,    One of my favorite MCA cuts: \\"Preparing the Cage,\\" is a 3:24 masterpiece of power, it builds and builds and builds. On the Mecca CD this cut is only 2.00 long and does not blast into the stratosphere like it does on the MCA CD. The MCA CD despite its very poor recording quality is nevertheless a unique and powerful presentation that must be owned along with the Mecca CD to have the full Jaws experience. If only they would do a 24 bit re-master of the MCA version.     Another comparison: I love the MCA 2:46 Promenade. But on the Decca it is only 1:31 and though perfectly accurate to the movie, it never gains the thematic glory that the MCA version does.    I have been spoiled by the MCA power themes but I still love this new Decca CD as well.    For a pure orchestral power experience the 12 cuts on the MCA CD are without a doubt complete themes that succeed. But for a movie reliving experience the Decca disc is the CD to have, though a rip and reorder of the cues will be needed if you want the cues to follow the logical progression of the movie.

B001QOGYBI|5.0|...and it's Wes Anderson at his finest.<br /><br />So what's the movie about?  Well, it's a simple story about a fox who's trying to overcome being what he is (a wild animal) and rise to be something better (noble father).  The fox who steals chickens, geese and cider has to eventually arise above his own selfish scams to save his family from some crazy farmers who have more ammunition than brains.  It's a relatively well-worn story idea with a lot of layering, character, and execution that either you love or you hate.<br /><br />This movie is HILARIOUS, but it's a different kind of humor.  There's no kicks in the crotch, no swearing (although they say the word \\"cuss\\" where swearing would be...genius!), no sex, no off-color or sixth grade humor.  This movie is made for people who appreciate subtlety and clever dialogue.  This movie is made for people who think that lateral (i.e. random) humor is actually funny when properly executed; think Monty Python without the ADHD.  If you're looking for a movie that your family can watch, this is it.  If you're looking for a movie to watch with your college philosophy class that you can analyse the tar out of, this is it.  If you're looking for a movie to watch late at night with your sweetheart and you're both too tired for something heavy, this is also it.<br /><br />Wes Anderson has the ability to make films that function on so many levels and yet are thoroughly entertaining for almost anyone.<br /><br />Top quality voice acting by Hollywood's finest and visual color and texture that is almost strange to see because it's so original.  I would never have thought that I would have loved a serious movie made with stop motion animation, but Wes Anderson pulls it off and makes it great!<br /><br />Highly recommended for all.

Most people seemed to love it, so I finally decided to take the plunge, and I'm glad I did: I found the book to be well-written, credible, full of interesting stories, and one of the best reads I've enjoyed in a long time. If you're a fan of the Beatles and interested in knowing what went on in the recording studio, I believe you'll enjoy this book as much as I did.

B001PPLJIQ|4.0|In post WWII Germany teenager Michael Berg (David Kross) becomes ill one day; fate brings him upon the doorstep of Hannah Schmitz (Kate Winslet), a simple tram worker with a mysterious past who is twice Michael's age.  What follows is an affair, sometimes innocent and at others tumultuous, that bonds the two despite their dissimilarities, over books and bedroom trysts.  After an abrupt and confusing end to their affair, Michael - now a law student - attends a seminar through which he reunites with Hannah in a less than pleasant manner.  A stupid decision fueled by shame overrules Hannah's logic, and desire to keep her illiteracy a secret outweighs her care or understanding of eventuality.  Years later they reacquaint - Michael now played by Ralph Fiennes - in a less than conventional manner that rekindles some of the past's feelings.  The final results are a personal travesty but an unobjectionably just resolution for humanity.<br /><br />Since the spoiler for this film is painfully clear, it's easy to speak of Hannah's past.  Having personally been to Dachau - not to mention having read Elie Wiesel's novel Night - I was ill affected by the attempts at compassion for the monster wearing a Kate Winslet disguise; her plight fell on deaf ears.  Neither stupidity nor apathy is a sufficient excuse for her actions, and anyone with even a cursory understanding of history shouldn't shed a tear over the final outcome of this film.  Brooks from Shawshank Redemption she is not.  Her character is a morally bankrupt, soulless, mass murdered responsible for willfully taking part in an attempted genocide.  Period.<br /><br />Despite the somber tone and misplaced attempt at sympathy, this is nonetheless the tour de force of Winslet's career.  Her acting range is magnificent; her portrayal flawless.  It's almost a successful reconciliation and I could see how the situation would sway viewers.  Both Kross and Fiennes play second fiddle very well.  Aside from a few minor developments, the script is fairly predictable.<br /><br />Ignoring the ephebophilia and the misplaced attempts at sympathy, this is a pretty good movie.<br /><br />Jason Elinfairly predictable.

B00000DQSS|5.0|My 3rd Kate Bush album (after the Red Shoes and the Sensual World) and my favourite so far. It has Babooshka, the song that made me get any of her music in the first place. Then there's Delius, which is such a pleasant and beautiful song. Violin makes you wanna sing along, The Wedding Gift is probably my favourite, because its so funny. And Egypt is so, soooo awesome.    Kate Bush has an awesome voice, and the background music is just awesome. I haven't owned anything like this before. The only thing that reminds of this is Goldfrapp's Felt Mountain, which is something that came way after (and Goldfrapp herself like's Kate Bush).

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|It was on the strength of \\"Little Lion Man\\" that I was persuaded to check out \\"Sigh No More,\\" the debut album of Mumford & Sons.  That track is very representative of the entire record.  They have a fantastically authentic English/Irish folk vibe that is dominated by guitar and banjo.  Piano, lively percussion, and various other string and wind instruments complete the compositions which have been optimally engineered for a full, rich sound.    The vocals are raw and passionate, perfectly complementing the music.  The slightly raspy lead is joined by subtle layered harmonies.  The lyrics are intimate and contemplative yet vague.  There is almost a gospel feel to the songs.  Yet they are not overtly religious.  It is more of a folksy, natural sensibility.    From the solemn opening strains of the title track to the frantic tumultuous crescendo of \\"Dust Bowl Dance,\\" or the driving, pulsing rhythms of \\"Thistle & Weeds\\" in between, all the songs are wonderfully evocative of emotion - exuberance, joy, hope.  They take flight and soar, transporting the listener with them.  One can almost imagine visiting a timeless English pub when hearing these songs.  They resonate deep within.
0307408833|1.0|After weeks of anticipation and gathering many expensive ingredients- some even had to be ordered online, this cookbook ruined my birthday!!!  We tried to make the hostess cupcakes for my birthday party, thinking it would be delicious.  We followed the directions and imagine my disappointment when the icing tasted so horrible no one wanted to eat my cupcakes!  The cake was okay but the icing tasted kind of like sweet glue but not as good as I remember from kindergarten.  It was really runny and all the cakes slid apart.  It just tastes off.  After doing some research, I found something interesting on the Babycakes website.  Apparently I'm not the only one disappointed.  The Babycakes girl said there is a \\"secret ingredient\\" that they use in the bakery but do not disclose in their book.  I think its only right to have the cupcakes taste like they do in the bakery.  There is deception afoot!  Next year I hope the Babycakes lady makes her birthday cake out of her book instead of her bakery, so her birthday can be ruined too!!!!!
0689865384|4.0|The Plot<br /><br />Meet Tally, an almost-16-year-old Ugly. Yes, Ugly. In Tally's world, people are considered Ugly until they become Pretty. And they become Pretty on their 16th birthday. How do they become Pretty, you ask? Via an operation, of course. This operation allows everyone to conform to to the ideal standard of beauty in order to keep the population on equal terms. When someone becomes a Pretty, they are shipped out of Uglyville into New Pretty Town, where they party the night away and have no responsibilities. Sounds like an ideal world, no? Wrong. Underneath all the glam and beauty lies a secret. Because we all know you don't get something for nothing...<br /><br />Tally accidentally meets Shay, another ugly whose 16th birthday is also right around the corner. Shay doesn't really see any problem with staying Ugly. She voices these opinions to Tally who is horrified at such a thought. Shay urges Tally to come to the outskirts of their world to the Rusties' ruins. Yes, they refer to former civilizations as Rusties due to the corroded cars and broken down buildings. They find such waste atrocious. At the ruins, Shay lets on she knows someone on the outskirts, someone who isn't part of their civilization, someone who doesn't believe in being Pretty just for the sake of fitting into society. In fact, there is entire village of people, living in a place called The Smoke...<br /><br />Shay makes a run for it. Unfortunately for Tally, she gets noticed by Special Circumstances, who knows of her connection with Shay and the Smokies. Special Circumstances demands that she assist them in finding the Smoke. Their ultimatum: Help us or remain Ugly forever.<br /><br />Will Tally betray the Smoke in order to become Pretty, or will she realize that all that glitters is not gold?<br /><br />The Review<br /><br />I love books with satirical themes. It is very obvious that this book brings to light the ridiculous nature of our society. We are so over the top about what beauty is, and so many young people struggle with looking like a Victoria's Secret model or David Beckham, when chances of looking like that are 1 in a mil. Young girls starve themselves and young boys become attracted to mostly model-types. We've forgotten what really makes someone beautiful. I also love the intense environmental destruction theme in the book, which is most definitely a call to how we're treating Planet Earth.<br /><br />I loved the riddled directions to the Smoke that Shay gave Tally. She had to decipher the meaning and it turned into a great adventure. I also think Tally grew up a lot during that very long, lonely and dangerous trek to a new society. Once she arrives at the Smoke, no longer do you see the self-centered, materialistic, naive young girl. Instead, a mature young lady has emerged, one who realizes there is more to life then just herself.<br /><br />I really loved reading about this future society. Their technology far surpasses ours. They have a metal grid running under the city so they can use hovercars and hoverboards. Hoverboards FTW!! Where can I get one? They also have something called a bungee jacket, which we get to read about in action more than once.<br /><br />David = Awesomesauce<br /><br />Dystopian fiction is the best. Seriously.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter is the only series that I find entertaining; dark comedy is not usually my taste but, for some reason, the many twists of underlying plots feeds the desire for more.

Now, I'll have to wait until season 5 is available. I'm waiting .......
B004927I50|5.0|A great new album by Taylor Swift which continues her chart-topping string of hits. Each of her previous albums are literally \\"greatest hits\\" collections on their own since nearly every tune on each album has appeared in the Billboard Hot 100. This particular deluxe edition (CD and DVD) is a Target exclusive which sells for about $17 or so in the store. There's no reason to pay more than that, so be careful before needlessly spending your hard earned dollars. The \\"big box\\" stores like Target and WalMart are always developing exclusive editions of music CDs by popular artists to get you to, obviously, shop at their stores. There's nothing wrong with this -- it's marketing, after all. But such arrangements don't make the product rare or hard to get and certainly doesn't make it worth spending twice or more what you'd spend by simply gioing down to the store or ordering from the store's website.
B003ZWTGKU|4.0|Jonas Kaufmann caused quite a stir in Paris when his Werther premiered in January 2010. This wonderful production has been captured and put on DVD so that now the rest of the world can enjoy the magnificent performances seen here.<br /><br />Jonas Kaufmann is just brilliant as Werther.  He has it all...the voice, the stage presence, the acting talent, and the artistry to know how to combine them all into a realistic and touching portrayal of Goethe's suffering poet, Werther.  His voice is very dark - almost baritonal sounding at times - but it fits in very well with the brooding intensity of this opera.  Jonas Kaufmann is also one of the best acting singers around in the opera world today and he does his role perfect justice.  An absolutely beautiful performance<br /><br />Not to be outdone however is Sophie Koch, who is perfect as Charlotte - the unattainable woman that Werther falls in love with.  Ms. Koch has a rich mezzo voice and her third act aria is thrilling to behold.  The romantic and dramatic tension between Werther and Charlotte is felt from the moment the two meet and through out the opera - it is these two characters who hold our attention and for whom we root for all the way!<br /><br />Albert, played by Ludovic Tezier was awesome as well!  He actually doesn't have that big a role but there is a menace underneath his gentility that is always palpable to the audience but it's almost as if he himself is not aware of the power that he radiates.  It's a uniquely understated performance and I was very impressed.<br /><br />The set design was simple, but effective and only added to the performances.  The music conducting was very good, not outstanding but it certainly held it's own with the other aspects of the production.<br /><br />Now, why I didn't give this DVD the five stars that the production so richly deserves is that the videography is VERY very distracting.  The camera shows you behind the scene footage while the opera is still going on...completely ruining the illusion that there is an actual, true story being presented on stage.  It's difficult to stay engaged with a story when you are constantly being reminded that it's only a performance and that the characters you're seeing on the stage aren't in fact real....I was very disappointed by this aspect of the DVD.  Also at times the camera does such close ups of one character that you can't see what how other characters are reacting on stage - where actual audience members could and would have seen all the stage action going on.<br /><br />Still though, I can only recommend that you DO buy this Werther.  It's a wonderful production and the singing, acting, and music all work together to bring this beautiful, touching story to life.  BRAVO!actual, true story being presented on stage.

0812977246|5.0|A key problem with genre fiction is its demands for pacing, fast action, and formulaic convention often hamper an author's attempt at distinctive writing. Many successful genre writers solve this issue by writing as blandly as possible. \\"Gorky Park\\" shows that genre writing can be as great as an author is willing to make it.<br /><br />Like any good police procedural, the story opens at the scene of the crime, the park of the title, in the heart of then-Soviet Moscow, circa 1977. Three bodies lie uncovered by melting snow, their faces and fingers sheared off. Police detective Arkady Renko takes the case fully conscious these are probably \\"enemies of the state\\" executed by the KGB, and that he will be pulled from the case as soon as he threatens any progress. Just to get the early reprieve, he works the case hard. Then two things strange happen. First, his boss tells him to keep at his investigation and never mind the KGB. Second, he begins to really care about solving it.<br /><br />When \\"Gorky Park\\" came out in 1981, it was a huge bestseller and critical fave. Much of this I think had to do with the novelty of the setting, the Soviet Union. Author Martin Cruz Smith fills his pages with a Mother Russia so bleak and real you can feel the cheap vodka curdling your guts, and this offered a unique peak at America's chief globo-political adversary at the time.<br /><br />The first time I read \\"Gorky Park\\", I was still in high school. Reading it as a genre detective story, I found it downbeat and hard to follow. Picking it up again was a triumph for hope over experience. I was blown away by the result.<br /><br />Smith's descriptive mastery of place and character was even better than I remembered. But more powerful still for me was how good this book really was, both as a sophisticated fiction of deep and convoluted feelings and as a really clever mystery thriller that, for a minimum of reader effort, engages you on so many levels.<br /><br />There's Renko himself, whose ambiguous feelings regarding the order he protects allows Smith not only to explore heady philosophical questions but keep you guessing as to what is going to hit him next. There are wide conspiracies, shifting enemies, and corruptions big and small. There's the enigma of a woman at the heart of the case whose prefers being told lies \\"if the truth is you'll never escape\\".<br /><br />And then there's John Osborne, Renko's apparent opposite number as the story develops, an American who seems comfortable straddling the worlds of capitalism and communism. \\"If money could grow bones and flesh it would be Osborne,\\" Smith writes. \\"It would wear the same cashmere suit; it would part its silver hair the same way; it would have the same lean mask with its expression of superior amusement.\\"<br /><br />There's even humor to be found here, though it took me a second reading to find it as it is written in the same snow-gray manner as the rest of the book. The matter of Renko's wife is a kind of heavy comic underscoring of the central storyline, especially as she pushes her heartless \\"Young Pioneer\\" manner against him as an act of State devotion. Everything about the Soviet Union seems to conspire against Renko, which makes his sense of lingering attachment to country more compelling.<br /><br />I'm not the least attached or nostalgic for the USSR, even in Beatles songs. But \\"Gorky Park\\" pushes past my biases and makes me care about one man's ability to hold that faith, not to mention keep turning pages through some of the hardest-to-remember proper nouns I've come across since Dostoyevsky. Its setting may be gone with the times, but the pull of \\"Gorky Park\\" is timeless.e protects allows Smith not only to explore heady philosophical questions but keep you guessing as to what is going to hit him next.

B00003CX8N|4.0|The year is 1951, and New York book-lover Helene Hanff (Anne Bancroft) writes to a small London bookshop in hopes of finding a rare book.  Her request is filled quickly and politely by employee Frank Doel (Anthony Hopkins).  Delighted with the good service, Helene continues to order books from the shop at 84 Charing Cross Road for the next twenty years and she and Frank become devoted pen pals, sharing stories about their personal lives in addition to their love of rare books.<br /><br />Bancroft plays Helene as loud, brassy, and generous while Hopkins' Frank is reserved, dignified, and kindly.  They connected on many levels and became great friends even though they never met.  Just when I thought their friendship was too contrived and precious, I remembered this was a true story and appreciated the depth of emotion that sprang from their letters.  It's hard to imagine today how meaningful handwritten, heartfelt letters could be but they were, and this movie is testament to the power of the personal letter.<br /><br />The movie spans twenty years and each era is wonderfully recreated in the clothes and cars and current events.  This is a sweet movie that has no action, but a good script that pulls at your heartstrings all the same...two real people who found an enduring friendship through their correspondence.  Recommended.

The package has two blu ray discs with a unrated  version of the movie and a made for dvd flick as well. I don't know if they will release this modern classic comedy on a regular blu ray without the extra film but certainly the packaging will be different after this edition sells out. Making it a collectors edition. This imo is a modern classic comedy, the movie just does everything right , it's funny and has great acting from everyone involved and it features the golden age of news anchorpeople the seventies, that was the decade when women really made inroads into the field and laid the groundwork for all the top anchors that would follow. The seventies too are always a great decade to have a comedy in, it's the predigital age (1980's-) and things were in someways better than today for sure, others not. but at least they didn't have bad rap music to contend with.<br />The characters are real enough not be believable too, after all the seventies was THe decade of excess and personal out of control freedom gone amuck. The blu ray looks stunning on all versions in this package. This one sold out at the chain store I got it at so grab this limited edition if you are a fan of great comedy and this one has quite a following because in the last decade it was one of the better comedies out there. And this one is without a doubt Will Ferrels most complete character and best work of his comedy career. He just creates a perfect character here which is more realized than some of his others movies characters.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|First off, STOP trying to compare this to BOB, it is nothing of the sort! If they were trying to make a BOB2, they would've said so.     The Pacific takes us on a journey with three marines throughout the pacific campaign based on the memoirs of two of the marines: Robert Leckie with his memoir \\"Helmet For My Pillow\\" and Eugene Sledge with his memoir \\"With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa\\". The third is John Basilone, a medal of honor recipient.    Considering this is made by the same folks of BOB, the cinematography is nothing short of spectacular with hard emphasis on making it as historically accurate as possible. Everything from the muddy hell of the jungle to the bare rock wasteland battlefields inland, the setting of the shots was expertly done.    One particular difference between BOB (I will not go into much comparison considering how touchy it is to some people...) is that The Pacific spends a significant more time with the marines off the battlefield allowing us to not only experience the men among their comrades but experience the psychological toll that the war was having on them. This in particular really impressed me on how well it was done and you can't help but get attached to the characters quickly and experience the pain and triumphs along with them.    Also, needless to say really, is that the battle scenes are brutally realistic as was done in BOB with an amazing amount of detail. The pacific theater presented new and different terrors rather than the European front. With the Japanese and their fanatical and fearless charges through the ranks of the men to the marines fighting not only the deceptive and clever eastern enemy but also the jungle as well.    I had a grandfather who was a marine sergeant in the pacific, surviving multiple landings such as the likes of Guadalcanal and Iwo Jima. Seeing the pain they went through and the endurance and spirit brought me to tears throughout the series imagining that is what he had to go through, whatthey all went through. A testament to those who fought and died, The Pacific really does them justice.     Semper Fi.

B0000AGQ6Z|4.0|Dear Amazon,    Please stop posting reviews for films that are, essentially, written for another version of the DVD's (and cd's) and not the one posted.    There are several DVD versions of Lawrence of Arabia.  They all differ wildly from each other in picture and sound quality.    How do you expect us to chose which is best for us if you post the same review from the 2001 version over and over and over again?  \\"Best dvd version yet.\\"    Yeah, right - in 2001 that may have been true.  But Amazon, you've posted this review for every version of this DVD even though the review was for a DVD originally released in 2001!  Lawrence of Arabia has been remastered twice since then, and the subsquent versions are very, very different.    Please stop this and take some responsibility and post reviews ONLY for their specific versions - or at least specify that the review was written for another version.

B00005JKG9|5.0|GGR is a superbly crafted movie. In a day and age where the objective seems to be to produce the biggest car chases, the biggest explosions, the most advanced CGI effects this movie stands on it's own without any of those things. All of the main actors are just outstanding. The plot line is fairly simple but engrossing due to the quality of the acting and the interplay between characters. Lemmon and Pacino are fabulous as always. To me, this is one of Jack Lemmon's finest works. His sense of desperation, loneliness and pathos really comes through. It's a very moving performance. But it's Alec Baldwin - whom I've never been a big fan of - that absolutely steals the show. He perfectly captures the arrogant, pushy, jackass of a salesman that we all love to hate. Easily his best performance. This movie is a must see. It's filmmaking at it's finest and not be be missed.

B0010X745K|3.0|The ending sucks.  It sucks on multiple levels.  The most trivial reason is that it's different than the novella.  The novella ended on a big question mark but in a way that feels...well like the characters survived the grocery store, but that this could be a much bigger problem than originally anticipated. The movie does two terrible things: At first it's a happy ending for the world.  The book leaves things in a mystery state of deterioration.  The movie proudly proclaims to all \\"hey look, we have flame throwers and this is totally under control. No problem.\\"  That is far less interesting.  And furthermore what the characters do is unnecessary at that point, completely uncharacteristic given what they'd done to survive up to that point, and that they were in no immediate danger.  Finally, it's just terrible story-telling.  I can make everyone at the end of any movie turn into butterflies or decide to eat someone or do anything shocking, and it's surprising but not good if it doesn't come about naturally in the story.  If you stop this movie after they drive under the big giant thing, you essentially have the ending of the book, and you will think this was a great movie.  Keep watching at your peril.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|This entire set of 10 DVDs has been watched by myself a couple of times.  The biggest fault I find in the series is the amount of time the stories spend on the love scenes, and non Pacific combat theatre scenes.  The story itself is concerned with the Marines only...and gives no attention to the contributions of the Navy or the Army in the Pacific.  However on the good side the combat scenes were great, the story introduced me to several (new to me)writers who were in the Pacific war and I am now reading their books.  Definitely worth the price amazon is posting.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Lots of of family fun and just as creative and entertaining as the two previous movies.  My grandaughter and I can't wait for the next one!
1591391105|5.0|I love this book.  It gives practical information and advice to those starting a new job or entering a new career.  It is good advice, especially for jobs with steep learning curves.  I give it to all my friends entering more challenging positions and college graduates entering the job market for the first time.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|This movie was terrible.  It had absolutely nothing going for it besides an awesome tsunami scene.  The acting was downright dull, the soundtrack was a three note guitar track widely dispersed and there was little if no substance to make any kind of viewer sit back and say, 'Now that was a good idea'.  I had no idea Clint Eastwood directed this flick until the credits starting rolling (which felt like a marathon just to get to).  I went to it on a date with my wife (who really just wanted to see it for Matt Damon) and I had no clue what it was about (and I'm still not really sure).  I guess the movie makes a weak attempt at explaining the importance of the afterlife to three complete strangers (two of which fall in love for reasons which make little sense).  Shame on you Clint.  After Mystic River and Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby? The only good thing I can say about this way-too-long-waste-of-hard-earned-cash is that the people did seem real.  You want some good movies about the afterlife?  Try the Sixth Sense or Flatliners or What Dreams may Come.  At least those movies have a pulse and flow.  I am not comparing this movie to those, but instead stating that a movie about the afterlife has more potential than this two hour snore-fest did.  Wait for DVD, and rent it at that.  Other than 'The Happening', this was the worse movie I have ever seen at the theater.

B000000WGL|2.0|Its a struggle to find songs that are great on this album. Its not rock, like rock guitar music. Keith has a weak voice, not warn with age; just weak.  The production is good. The project was a one off try by Virgin to milk money out of Richard's fame.  It is a bar band at best. I think the album belongs in the bargain bin at Big Lots.  All the reviews here are blatantly over supportive of Mr. Richard's; and over praise this album.
1935251740|1.0|Biocentrism forfeits genuine scientific inquiry and lays out the bald assertion that conscious life fundamentally shapes reality.  To cut to the proverbial chase, the entire premise of this theory (consciousness alone shapes certain aspects of reality) ignores the fact that consciousness did not always exist in our universe, yet remarkably enough reality persisted in its absence.  Taken in light of that, what we're left with is an idea persisting within the peculiar void betwixt pseudo-science and bad poetry; a relativistic jumble of self-induced confusion muddled further by sloppy conflations, equivocations, and quotes without context.  Shroedinger's cat seems to be the only thing approaching empirical evidence brought to the table, with the \\"quantum\\" regularly intoned in an almost Chopran-style of nonsensical mysticism, yet unsurprisingly absent is the admission that there is much we do not understand about quantum mechanics.    If indulging in literary shark jumping is your game, and you happen to check your horoscope every day, this book is probably right up your alley.  If you think you'd enjoy a playing logical whack-a-mole, this would make a fine future doorstop.  For the rest of you who want a solid cosmology without all the spooky new-age woo, try Lawrence Krauss or Stephen Weinberg.

B003UTUQ3E|5.0|It's all about the music. In 1976 this was an album without peer... for my money that has not changed. The 2 disc live set is long overdue. If David digs through the archives and comes up with a live video release of the isolar tour I will have to come off my wallet again; I still remember the moment the lights went down and the lead guitar cut through the smokey atmosphere of Cleveland's public hall. White light, white heat the arrival of the thin white duke.

B002DZX96C|3.0|It's hard to categorize these recording as anything other than completely underwhelming. Other reviewers have categorized Brendel's playing as being from the \\"weak tea\\" school; I agree, but would go further and say it is so unimaginative and uniformally bland throughout all 32 pieces, that this makes for a wholly monotonous listening experience.<br /><br />The proof? Each sonata is played in the same deliberate, ponderous manner that Brendel manages to make them sound nearly the same. It's as if Beethoven wrote them all in the same year. What he's given us is one sonata in 32 movements.<br /><br />I have many of Richard Goode's recording (though not the complere set) and would strongly recommend his set to Brendel's. There's life to Goode's playing. He's not brilliant, but he brings nuance, deftness, and a musicallity that Brendel lacks.
0802130208|5.0|A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole<br />Published 1981<br />338 pages<br />Classic; Pulitzer; Picaresque; FITG<br />4.5/5 stars<br /><br />Source: Library<br /><br />Summary: I've tried describing this before to my friends but I don't think I'm doing a very good job. Basically Ignatius J Reilly is a lazy eccentric who is forced to get a job leading to a series of adventures involving many Characters.<br /><br />Thoughts: I was excited to read this because it's one of my dad's favorite books and he's recommended it to me before.  While I can appreciate its strong points, I don't think it's one of my favorites.  For one thing, I prefer a main character I love and would want to hang out with. Ignatius Reilly had many interesting characteristics but I would never want to meet him.  On the one hand, he's obsessed with the Middle Ages and thinks things would be better with an enlightened monarchy (I'm not saying he's wrong what with the way things are...)  He is very educated with a graduate degree and he speaks far beyond the comprehension of the people around, which is very funny to read.  On the other hand, he lies, he's selfish, and he's cruel to his mama among other offenses. So not someone I'd want to meet but someone who is a Character.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book was how the disparate characters and earlier events tied together-I mean it's perfect.  It's not like crazy coincidences as Dickens does but instances that logically follow the previous events.  The part I didn't like was how intensely awkward some scenes were for me to read.  I could not have read this book all in one go because I had to take breaks and distance myself from what was happening.<br /><br />It's been defined as a picaresque novel which I always associate with Don Quixote.  It's been a while since I've read that but I remember some of the occurrences escalating in a similar way so I can see it.  For example, Ignatius has a simple office job before he decides that he will organize the workers at a factory which almost leads to a riot.  It's amazing.<br /><br />Overall: Intensely awkward at times, very funny at times with the perfect ending.<br /><br />Cover: I found this cover weird at first but it actually makes perfect sense after reading the book.to a riot.

0439023513|5.0|I'm not sure why some people hated this book. What did you expect? This was a book of war, of violence, of pain and loss because of it. Personally, I thought it was the greatest ending to one of the best series I've read in a long time (Harry Potter always comes first in my heart...I grew up with it), and more importantly, IT COULDN'T HAVE ENDED ANY OTHER WAY.     While you can find Mockingjay and the rest of the Hunger Games books in the young adults fantasy area of a bookstore, in no way shape or form did I consider this a child's book. It may have been intended for the youth of today, as a reminder that war and bloodshed isn't as exciting or exhilarating as it is portrayed in movies and video games, but it wasn't meant to be read as a silly little fantasy book filled with wonder and enchantment. If you want that (and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that---I love those kinds of books), look elsewhere...and try to read the back summary for an idea of what you're getting yourself into next time. Granted, I would've liked more romance in the series, but again romance wasn't the point of the Hunger Games either. It was to show us just how horrible war can be.     I admit, I was certainly surprised how it all ended--who lived, who died, and what kind of woman Katniss Everdeen would become...along with who was left with her to pick the pieces of her twice/thrice broken heart, after all the horrible events that transpired in her young life throughout the books. But I still love reading Mockinjay very much and it was certainly worth the wait. Also, best last line I've ever read in a book...just saying.
0425200469|5.0|Death on the Nile by Agatha Christie<br />Avenel Books, 1937<br />164 pages<br />Mystery; Hercule Poirot<br />4.5/5 stars<br /><br />Source: Library<br /><br />Summary: A fabulously wealthy, young bride named Linnet is murdered on a boat while on her honeymoon.  The top suspect would be her former best friend who was first engaged to Linnet's husband but she has a clearcut alibi.  Luckily Hercule Poirot is on the case!<br /><br />Thoughts: I knew this was one of Christie's more famous works so I had pretty high expectations.  The opening reminded me somewhat of other famous ones like Murder on the Orient Express and And Then There Were None as it gives a brief vignette of all of the characters who will be part of the story.<br /><br />The victim is a rather awful girl, Linnet, who stole her best friend's fiance and is consequently being stalked by that best friend on her honeymoon.  Linnet has always gotten everything she's wanted and is thus very displeased at having that best friend stalking her on her honeymoon.  However this friend Jacqueline sucks too and I couldn't understand Poirot's kindness to her.<br /><br />Besides solving the murder, he also accounts for two other criminals yet Poriot seems to be sentimental and lets the one off to possible romantic bliss.  There are some other subplots too but the murder is the main focus.<br /><br />I did not like the end although I somewhat puzzled out the murderer!  But really I did not like the end which has a bit of the Murder on the Orient Express to it (hopefully this makes sense if you've read both. I don't want to spoil it-let's just say I like using the court system for justice.)<br /><br />Overall: An outstanding story from Christie with exciting characters although I personally do not like the end.
142311339X|5.0|I know this series is a sequel to the Percy Jackson series, but I think The Lost Hero stands very strongly on its own with fun and interesting characters (Piper is a personal favorite of mine; she's not as serious and uptight as Annabeth seemed to be--sorry Annabeth fans!), and the plot wasn't half bad either. You'd think the school setting with the mysterious guardian and sudden onslaught of monsters in the beginning and not really stopping until the end would get old, but Riordan actually keeps it pretty fresh. Also, I think Riordan's writing has improved a lot since he first started writing the Percy Jackson series, though his clever wit and humor is still as prevalent now as it was in previous books. Learning about different Greek and Roman mythologies was also a delightful experience, being a fan of both of these civilizations myself. What's more, I liked how these two tend to intermesh frequently, and how it affected the characters and the gods in the course of the story...oh, but I don't want to give anything away! Just read the damn book. Its worth it.     The only criticism I do have is that I have to wait a whole another year for the next one. I need more Heroes of Olympus! Oh well, I guess there is the next book in the Kane Chronicles to look forward to as well...also a great book! Basically, Rick Riordan is one of my new favorite authors. I have all his books actually, and I'm planning to get 39 clues next...
031603438X|4.0|I only mildly like the Stone's music, but I like well-written autobiographies.<br /><br />Keith Richards has stories to tell. And while a journalist named James is 'helping' it's apparently Richards's tale. He reveals all kinds of intimate details about his life, including some which we'd never previously expected (can you really see him as a boy scout!).<br /><br />It was alternately humanizing and a letdown that the brushes with death this guy had came from everyday accidents. They did not come from his (admittedly wild) past with drugs however.<br /><br />Personally not liking surgery myself, I did not realize that people could get blood clots from falling out of trees. Just the imagery which he gives with these incidents made me shudder. Yikes! Whatever his DNA is made of, it's very durable stuff because he just gets sewn up and then goes back out. Way to go Keith! I wonder how long this guy is actually going to live?<br /><br />I saw my family in his love for his children. We get so wrapped up in the music that we forget that they are also parents who care for their children. Reading his prose made me think about my own father and how to cherish the time which we have together.<br /><br />It's an essential purchase for Stones fans, but anybody liking good biographies will also benefit. The informal style of prose in this book makes it both easy and enjoyable to read.
0099527561|5.0|In this second novel featuring surfer/PI Boone Daniels, author Winslow catches a primo wave and takes the reader along for another thrilling ride.<br />The first Boone Daniels adventure, THE DAWN PATROL, was very, very good --- THE GENTLEMEN'S HOUR is even better. If you haven't read THE DAWN PATROL, you should. (Hell, you should read everything by Winslow, but that's another matter.) It is probably best --- but not essential --- to read the Daniels books in sequence. At the core of each is Boone and his crew of hardcore surfer buddies. They've all been friends for many years and begin each day together out on the surf --- the Dawn Patrol --- before dispersing to live the other parts of their lives. Their paths also cross in other ways, but it is the time on the surf that truly bonds them.<br />While this recurring cast is colorful and endearing, the other characters you meet in THE GENTLEMEN'S HOUR are colorful enough ... but, while certainly memorable, some of them are far from endearing. Betrayal, deceit, bribery, adultery, racial prejudice, torture, bullets to the brain, decapitation, dismemberment ... all are encountered and captured in precise prose and intricate plotting that compels the reader to keep turning pages. Yet at the heart of this story --- beyond all the violence and menace --- there is also nobility and genuine love. The bond that holds the Dawn Patrol together is shaken by events that unfold here, even as Boone is left questioning his own future while at the same time being drawn into a romance with a beautiful lady lawyer that threatens to turn into the hitherto dreaded \\"r word\\" --- a relationship.<br />It is a testiment to Winslow's skill as a writer and the connection he forges between the reader and his cast of regulars that when the Dawn Patrol re-unites to make a stand against some  baddies in the closing pages, it is nothing short of stirring. As Winslow tells it: \\"Epic ... Macking ... Crunchy.\\"<br />So pull on a pair of comfortable baggies, slap some zinc oxide on your nose (work with me here - a little imagination, okay?) and climb aboard for this exciting ride. You will not be disappointed.zinc oxide on your nose (work with me here - a little imagination, okay?) and climb aboard for this exciting ride. You will not be disappointed.

0312600844|1.0|This satire (surely not unintentionally so) of contemporary American culture throughly exposes unattractive, flawed characters (caricatures?) who are tedious, self-absorbed, and atrocious at decision making. Extremes of religious, political, right and left, greens and rapacious businessmen, middle class, alcoholics, lower class, sibling rivals, failed parenting, and more are put on view primarily through a dismally boring third-person autobiography of the main character. Fortunately the Gulf oil spill had not occurred at Freedom's writing, else we would have been subjected to another hundred pages.

PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND epitomizes the Summer of Love, yet with the hindsight of four-plus decades it's also clear that save for some exceptional cover art this album is too inconsistent for the \\"legendary\\" status that so many accord it.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Oh Captain, My Captain...  having just come up for air after the nastiest midterm election in memory during a crappy & difficult span of time where corporations seem poised to come out from behind the curtain, do away the the middleman expense of political puppetry and start governing we the people directly.....this film brought me back from the brink.    folks, i know this is just a film. but it carries a whalloping dose of cure for the broken spirit.    technically, yes, yes, yes, good stuff, great stuff, refer to the techno-centric reviews for that angle.  what i'm takling about here is GOOD story telling.  excellent casting ( i very much appreciate each players' 'study' of the original characters) the WOW special teams' work, FAB directing and bang on- where did YOU come from? writing!!!! no small trick to reinvigorate an established well loved mythology with such grace and apparent affection for the subject matter.    i am 51 have have loved our captain kirk, our first mate spock, bones, you know...the WHOLE gang(next generation et al).  have seen all the movies.  loved them, some more than others....THIS ONE IS THE BEST!!!  back to the beginning! so cool to learn the back  stories of how the bonds formed and told in such believable and charming manner.  i laughed(lots of chuckles throughout), i cried (when jim & spock meet by torchlight)...then laughed and cried again(some very emotionally touching scenes).  with each old chum being presented on screen one by one, scene by scene; each obligatory catch phrase popping up so organically....sitting on my couch in my living room in my floppy socks/sweat pants/tshirt uniform, i found myself repeatedly cheering, clapping, laughing and tearing up.  a thousand thank youes to mr. nemoy for participating.  it would NOT have been as moving an experience without him.  by the end of the movie both me & robbie were wiping tears from our faces while smiling from ear to ear!    i am RENEWED. i am once again HOPEFUL.     a movie that can do THAT is GOOD story telling.    now if we could only get governments to follow the Federations' model instead of a business model, we may actually get somewhere.

B003R0LBVW|4.0|Franzen's Freedom is with good reason a best-selling novel. It purports to encapsulate the emotional trauma we Americans inevitably face as we make our way through this life. Although he commits only to developing a few of his characters, we do get to know the love triangle of Patty, Richard, and Walter quite well.<br /><br />This book was particularly relevant for me personally, as many of the characters exist in the same domains I've found myself wandering over the last few years. There's Patty, the former women's basketball player. I find myself thinking back to my own time working as a manager for the women's basketball team in college, and sympathizing with Patty's frustration at not getting the recognition she thought she deserved by her family and other fans as an athlete. There's also the caricatured Duke student, obsessed with money, status, and everything that firms like Goldman Sachs can bring to its soldiers. And there's the intrigue of the shady defense contractors' dealings with the West Virginia mines. As an aerospace and defense professional, I found my industry represented in the worst possible light. Regardless of the one-sided spin the book takes on such concerns, I was moved by the powerful human transformations that occur throughout the book as individuals grapple with the convolutions of life.<br /><br />While the book does have a happy ending (disappointing), it's overall portrayal of the Midwest as a hopeless, drifting, aimless world paints too depressing a picture. I hope others in the Midwest commit to living outside the bounds of Franzen's limits for human potential.
B00275EHJG|1.0|This movie was so dissapointing!  I loved both Toy Story 1 and 2, I could recite most of Cars by heart, and I've never made it through Wall-E or Up.  My 8 year old said \\"Up\\" was sad and he didn't like it, and my 6 year old cried all the way through this movei and begged to leave the movie.  I made him stay convinced that Disney wouldn't make a movie this depressing and it would obviously get better...wouldn't it.  I kept telling him through each sad and scary scene \\"it'll be ok I promise\\" - he kept asking to leave.  I thought it would be better for him to see that it would turn out happy and so he wouldn't leave sad - WRONG!  I actaully thought that Disney/PIXAR had lost it when they got to the incinerator scene and I truly wondered if they would die - what benefit does that have for the TARGET audience... (under 12) - sadness tears and nightmares.  Speaking of nightmares...that monkey is unnecessarily scary - think Chucky.  The camera work when the monkey screams is equivalent to horror films...Why Disney Why????  I don't know who paid off the reviewers, or what kind of society that we live in that these are the movies that are \\"AMAZING\\" for our kids - but I'll stick with PBS shows - this was awful!!!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|First impression picking this thing up: Whoa... It's officially the heaviest knife in my collection. It's actually heavier than the 2\\" longer BK7 because the blade is so thick. The balance point is at the upper screw of the grip, which gives it great feel, but you get the impression you've got an ax-blade and not a knife in your hands (not a bad thing: you feel like you can take on the toughest camping/survival tasks with confidence). Don't let the pictures fool you: this isn't a \\"small\\" knife. It makes similar \\"sized\\" knives like the Gerber LMF or Prodigy feel puny. (It makes the BK7 feel puny...)    That said (did I mention heavy?), I really like this knife. The hard sheath is nicer than the nylon of the BK7 and BK9--the only con is the retention system is still very stubborn: you really have to pull hard (possibly dangerously so). The new model now has the same hexagonal tang extension at the butt as the BK7 and BK9, so you've got a glass breaker and sort-of hammer. The ergonomics are fantastic (once you get used to the weight). If you don't mind carrying the extra ounces, this is maybe your best choice for making shelter and fire (and supper), and I can't imagine what you'd have have to do to \\"accidentally\\" destroy the blade (you might crack the handles, but they're removable and replaceable if you're handy).    If you have to do a lot of fine cutting, you might get tired because of the weight, so might want to pair this with a smallish folder. Also, the tip is rather obtuse and thick (like the corner of an ax-blade). But no backside guard means you can choke up on it for finer tasks (put your thumb on the very wide back edge), and you can baton away (or just chop--this monster chops very well).    If you like knives, or need a really sturdy camp tool, definitely get one of these.
0312370849|5.0|I cried when I read this book. When I began reading I was so eager to find out what happen I read it pretty much in one day, because I simply could not put it down. Everyone has heard of the Holocaust and how awful the Jews were treated, but in this book it feels like you are right there seeing and experiencing it for yourself. It also describes it in a childs eyes as well. Great book!
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headphone has great quality sound, g-key bottoms can be custom as you want (with win amp, media player, etc.) quality sound it's very good, when you turn up volume the bass shake your head, and the better it's wireless, cons: expensive. very good team with G19.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|i absolutely LOVED this book...but the only thing i am mad about is that percy lost his memory. i know it is a popular theme in stories but still. i mean that seems like the Percy Jackson series was a waste of time if he is gonna forget about it! and if he cheats on annabeth because he does not remember her i am going to SCREAM!    anyway jason was great...almost as hot as percy...almost. and i love how Piper a daughter of Aphrodite is presented as a girl who cares more about inner beauty than outer...a big difference from how the daughters of Aphrodite and Aphrodite herself are shown in the other books. leo is a great guy...his love for Fetus the bronze dragon and how Fetus in the end gets to play a part in uniting the two demigod camps of Greek half bloods and Roma half bloods almost made me cry!    overall a book you won't want to put down in spite of how ridiculously long it is
B003E48AYC|5.0|I love the use of color in this movie. It is as if an antique storybook has come to life.  I think Johnny Depp is one of the great actors of our generation.  I also like the fact that he likes to explore different views with director Tim Burton
B00006AW2G|5.0|great cd, The Rolling Stones rule!!    I like em all, from let it bleed, sticky fingers, etc. All rolling stones albums are good stuff.    To me an I don't care about other people options but I think this band is way better than the beatles.    Dont get me wrong but I do like listening too beatles 2 but not as much as I like the rolling stones.    I also like Frank Zappa & The mothers of Invention band too. An Pink Floyd, Michael Jackson, etc.    I enjoy all of their music, pf, stones, mj, fz, etc.    The radio stations are lame like oldies because always play same song over and over again an too much commericals and talking too.    At least on cds you can listen too the entire album an never have people talking/commercials in em as well.    CD's are way better than stupid radio an plus most of todays music sucks compare too the classics like this rolling stones, etc.      I stay away from all the todays main stream music like slipknot, linkin park, nine inch nails, back street boys, britney spears, jay z, etc. I think those bands are terrible.
B003XQRZ7E|3.0|The Cd packs a lot of punch without hesitation however where it packs punch, it lacks melody.  Overall the CD is very mediocre and though he claims his voice has never been better, I would have to disagree.  Glenn Hughes' voice was insurmountable in the 70's, better than David Coverdale's in fact.  Though his voice is still in good form, just not as good.    Jason is no John.  His fills are repetitious throughout the CD (being a drummer since 1972 it is easy to recognize).  Though his drumming is quite good, just not as good as his dad's.    The keyboards are the true coating over the mediocrity of the music presented here.  It brings life to the entire session--great job by Derek Sherinian    Bonamassa does some fine work here but by his earlier solo efforts (not his last CD) it doesn't compare.    Overall not a bad cd, not a good cd.    One would expect so much more with this kind of talent behind the steering wheel.
B0042JTAI8|1.0|As a reader who adored Kate mortons previous novels, I was anxiously awaiting the publication of this latest book. I was bitterly disappointed. I found the storyline to be completely contrived. Firstly the concept that the true history of the mud man would be a beloved childrens book was unbelievable to me. The idea was gloomy and dark and unattractive and only served to set the scene for how the book would subsequently unfold. It was boring and very heavy going, filled with characters that I couldn't bring myself to care about. I felt that the author was simply going through the motions and there was no sense of the mystery of the previous two books. Had I purchased this first, I wouldn't have bothered with the forgotten garden or the house at riverton. Frankly, I'm sorry I  wasted my money on it.
B003YOWU1Q|3.0|I'm a big fan of Ray LaMontagne.  Over the years I've fallen in love with songs like \\"Empty\\", \\"Trouble\\", \\"Shelter\\", \\"Sarah\\", and \\"Let it Be Me\\".  There are usually at least three songs of incredible quality on each Ray LaMontagne album, so I expected no less from this one.  I saw the CD at Starbucks, so picked it up on a whim expecting good things.  However, I was disappointed with this one.  There are no songs on this album that will be Ray classics like the aforementioned songs.  The only song that even comes close to his typical quality, in my opinion, is \\"Repo Man\\", which is fun and upbeat.  My advice is, skip this album and wait for the next one.  You won't be missing much.
0393061310|1.0|Jared Diamond is plagued by the same politically correct Euro-centric bias that refuses to look beyond his European and Jewish worldview that everything started from Eden. He is happily ignorant of the political history, influence and achievements of ancient Indian, Persian, Indo-Chinese, Chinese and American civilizations. He is a brilliant man with a great logically sound yet incomplete and misleading story. He simply overstates the accomplishments of the fertile crescent and Europe and the geographical challenges in Africa. The civilizations of Angkor succeeded in some of the most densest jungles of Asia. The Incas independently built a civilization more advanced than any in Europe at heights of 12,000 feet above sea level. The torrid and humid whether of India has always favored malaria. While geography, technology and germs are significant, human ingenuity, luck, geo-political realities and immunity from &#34;guns&#34;, barbarism, plunder and invasion are factors that determine the success and development of a civilization far more.<br /><br />India, China, Egypt and Persia were all technologically superior to Europe until the 19th century. They fell to the colonial powers purely because of political reasons. No germs, guns, or steel! There was a long bloody civil war in Peru between Atahualpa and his brother Huascar prior to the arrival of the conquistadores. Had the spaniards arrived in Peru 50 years earlier they would have been decimated. In reality, Europe acquired all their cargo only in the last 2 centuries, for most of the last 5000 years, the people with the best cargo have been the Indians, Chinese, Persians and Peruvians. And now in the 21st century, the cargo is going back to Asia! I wonder what relevance this book would have in 2 centuries from today. Neither Germs, Guns or Steel mattered in Alexander's conquest of Persia, Arab conquest of Persia or Mongol conquests by Genghis Khan. Ambition, economics and opportunism may be intangibles hard for scientists like Jared Diamond to grasp but they are all too real! India developed and exported Wootz steel for 5000 years until the British killed the industry in the late 1800s. The fact that India produced the best steel in the world did not stop it from being conquered by Barbaric Turks, Mongols or Europeans. Deceit and brutality conquered India not lack of technology.<br /><br />Peru's latitude is closer to Sub Saharan Africa than the temperate regions of Europe. The Peruvians took great pains to adapt their varieties of corn and potatoes across different altitudes in effect producing 1000s of varieties by the ingenuity of their terrace cultivation techniques. The north-south longitudinal theory of agriculture is just pure drivel. The simple truth is that some civilizations try and develop despite difficult geographical constraints while others just don't.By just taking the example of Peru and India, one can repudiate every theory by Jared Diamond.<br /><br />Also, I find it hard to believe that the Chinese script evolved from Cuneiform. The script of the Indus Valley remains undeciphered.<br /><br />Such a book if made required reading in school can bias children early on into believing a myopic, distorted over-simplification of history. The book has little new to offer other than a catchy Hollywood title. Jared diamond is willfully very naive in his analysis. The large number of positive reviews makes me wonder how easily people take information on face value when they hear something from a &#34;well educated intellectual&#34;. Jared Diamond seems to have come up with a theory and done extensive research to collect evidence for it. If he did his research first and then came up with a theory the Book would perhaps been called - Politics, Economics and Ambition - a much more mundane title, but an honest one.ke Jared Diamond to grasp but they are all too real!

B002VPE7AQ|5.0|First off, I would like to add an additional 5 stars to this book! It was a phenomenal story that I totally recommend. I loved getting both character's POV, especially from Alex. Seriously, who wouldn't fall in love with this guy?!     I was sucked in by the flow of brit and alex's relationship, never knowing what was going to happen next... and how about that killer ending and epilogue?! Si, si quiero mas!    I can't give this book enough props for being bad ass from beginning to end!
B003UYV08E|5.0|Great movie,  again came with just the case and DVD but thats all you need for a movie.  good price, quick delivery. very satisfied.
0307592839|5.0|A remarkable work - seemingly at the outer edges of \\"post modern\\" but without the knowing and self-congratulating irony. This author manages to sneak up on the reader somewhere near the base of the skull and invade the whole nervous system. One of very few novels I've read more than once.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Awesome movie.  Got it used and for cheap, came with just the case and DVD but thats all i needed.  absolutely loved it.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|i grew up watching this movie. after years of waiting for the 3rd one. its still beautiful as ever. i will share this movie with my children. one of the greatest movie ever told. and the ending was beautiful, honestly made me tear up. worth every penny!
B003EV6DBW|3.0|I have to start this off saying that I truly wanted to love series 5 and spoilers are contained in this review. I am a newer fan to the series in general, but I fell (and fell hard) for the whole concept of the show. I'm 23 and have watched all the current series, own all the dvds, and even found the classic series and have watched through most of Tom Baker and look forward to seeing the rest of it. Point is, I'm a die hard fan. I love this show and when David Tennant left - though he was my doctor - I was looking forward to a fresh start. David's Doctor, while amazingly brilliant in my opinion - was getting worn down by his losses. I understand why Tennant had to leave. I was leary about Matt but was willing to give him a shot. Moffat has wrote many of my all time favorite episodes of the series. I was psyched.     And then Eleventh Hour played. I loved the jokes. I loved the post regeneration moment with young Amelia Pond and the newly regenerated 11th doctor. But I feel like Matt Smith didn't earn my following. It seems each regeneration, The Doctor proves to the audience (and sometimes his companions) that he is the same man. That he's just packaged a little different - usually a little quirkier - but all in all, the same mad man in a box I initially fell in love with. I feel like the writers didn't give me this...moment. I never had that spot of \\"THAT'S THE DOCTOR\\" when watching the episode. I feel like the Writers cheated both Matt and Karen their entrances. It's almost like Series 5 was written as \\"Here's the new doctor. Here's his companion.\\". We never \\"met\\" them.     All in all, I don't feel like the episodes left time for anyone to fall in love all over again. It was rushed (as were 90% of the other episodes in the series) and it seems Matt's Doctor only has 2 emotions - Mad and Madder (not in the angry sense).     So, ok, Eleventh Hour and the first couple episodes didn't impress me overall. They were good. They were Doctor Who Sci-Fi and I continued. I was really looking forward to the Weeping Angels two parter. Blink was just....it blew me away. It's probably the best story EVER in Doctor Who and Time of the Angels was just...lacking. I wanted more information about them. They were this...amazingly creepy villian and I feel like that two parter ruined them for me. I mean, an army of weeping angels and not one person got thrown out of their time? Five Weeping Angels were all that was needed in Blink to keep the creepy factor - I still can't walk past a statue without feeling the need to keep staring at it. But a full army of them? I don't know. It just felt like over kill. They lost their creepiness. It was too over-the-top.     And the finale? It was set up to be amazing! The Doctor's greatest enemies coming together to lock him inside this box?! To \\"save\\" the universe?! Brilliant! And what did we get in \\"The Big Bang\\"? A hour of The Doctor running around with a mop and a fez. It was a total let down.     All in all, I was highly disappointed in the fifth series.     The only reason I didn't give up on the season was because of River Song. She made Series 5 and will probably make Series 6 as well.
0307408833|1.0|The layout, descriptions and photographs are tasty looking and inspiring. However, I made several recipes (sugarplum cookies, chocolate cupcakes and chocolate frosting) and was very disappointed!!!! I had such high hopes for the recipes. I'm glad I checked out the book from the library instead of purchasing it. I followed the directions exactly and used the exact ingredients. I wish that I hadn't spent so much money on the high grade vegan ingredients. I am hoping I can find other recipes in which to use the gluten free flours.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|The story takes place deep in the Ozarks.  The people in the film would be commonly referred to as 'white trash'. Their homes are more like junk yards than homes and they live in a culture dominated by drugs and violence (or the threat of violence). Ree is a 17 year old young woman left with the responsibility of raising her 12 year old brother and 7 year old sister and taking care of her mother who suffers from depression and is there in body only.  The father has been in and out of trouble with the law for 'cooking crank' and spent time in prison. They live in a shack of a home with a 100 acres of woods behind.  One of the more poignant moments occurs early when Ree takes her brother & sister to school and as she's leaving she looks in the windows of the classrooms where her peers are learning to care for a baby or practicing ROTC drills or other things that a normal 17 year old girl would be doing in school. But Ree is no ordinary 17 year old no matter how you slice it. She's determined to make it (if only to survive) with the cards she's been dealt. When she finds out that her father used their property as collateral to post bail for his upcoming court appearance and they will lose the home in a week if he doesn't show, she becomes obsessed with finding him to protect the only material possession they have.  No one seems to know (or is willing to tell if they do) where her father is. Finding him is the plot of the story.  But it is also a social drama on this overlooked subculture in America. This is not a feel good, happy ending film. It's a very realistic and well done drama about people who seem to have very little hope in this world for a better life and spend their lives living on the fringe of society with drugs and their family feuds. The violence and the language are not overly graphic or gratuitous but caution in watching with anyone under 15-16.  Well done and well written film about this subculture. Hard to watch and riveting at the same time.  Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as Ree.
1416583408|5.0|I have \\"read\\" a half dozen non-fiction books on Dogs, Dog History & Dog Behavior and this is the very best from every standpoint. Dr. Horowitz has written this wonderfully Authoritative & Informative \\"Handbook\\" about our Best friends. Not a boring moment throughout the book.  Her writing style is captivating, witty and it reads as easy, as a romance novel with a happy conclusion. I'm legally blind so I've found it also in an Audible format. I'm now on my third \\"reading\\" (replay) perhapsI guess, in an attempt to consolidate some of the most memorable portions of the book into my memory. Dr Hurwitz's book has now helped me to begin to understand some of the \\"unusual\\"behaviors of my five-year-old Jack Russell Terrier. Great Book, Great Read!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|A film about \\"Facebook\\"?  Yeah, right.  Are you for real?<br /><br />Well, I for one can say with confidence that \\"The Social Network\\" is a terrific film.  It covers the early years of Facebook and its genesis by a nerdy Mark Zuckerberg.  There are claims of intellectual property theft.  In fact, it is really a fast moving court room drama.  The film's two hours just fly by.<br /><br />So, my initial thoughts about \\"The Social Network\\" couldn't have been more wrong.  This is a very skillful film with sharp dialogue.  It is of such quality that I would not be surprised to see it nominated for a number of Oscars.  Stranger things have happened.<br /><br />We all know that Facebook is a phenomenon.  But it began from very humble beginnings.  Zuckerberg is certainly a prodigy but was the idea his alone?  This is what the film sets out to explore.  In so doing, the viewer becomes an observer to a great story, great acting and a compelling tale.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this film.  Do not have second thoughts.  See it!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is the best movie of all time!!!!!!!!!  Nobody is forcing you to buy it again!!!!

0439023513|5.0|After reading the entire trilogy I needed the story to end the way it did. I will admit feeling a little bogged down with all the military action in the final book, but if places are rebelling there isn't much help for that. Overall I enjoyed the story, some of the old characters you were able to see how they really tick and what drives them, some for the better...some for the worse. I would of loved to get more personally attached to the characters that were Katniss's military team, it would of made their stories more gripping when you read what happens. There were a few loose ends that were never tied up, but they were minor characters in the grand scheme of things, but I wanted to know what happened to them. Despite all that, after going through all the ups-and-downs with Katniss and those around her you needed it to end the way it did, perhaps a bit more detail or more story there but how it tied up at the end was just what I was looking for.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|To state the obvious; if you were alive when \\"Double Fantasy\\" was released, into music, and heard \\"Double Fantasy,\\" the stunning events to follow changed everything in your world. As such, it rates five stars on my ratings method in that it altered the course of music in its wake. What was meant as a return to creation was suddenly altered into an elegy for lost talent.<br /><br />Which made the songs all the more heartbreakingly ironic. \\"Just Like Starting Over\\" was meant to be a love letter to rediscovered romance. \\"Watching The Wheels\\" an explanation as to why John Lennon had spent five years out of the spotlight. And \\"Beautiful Boy\\" a fuller explanation, as an ode to his son Sean. Even the album's concept, as a 'heartplay' between John and Yoko Ono, altering songs back and forth between them in what was often a call and response. John would sing \\"I'm Losing You,\\" Yoko would respond \\"I'm Moving On.\\" John even gave Yoko the last word, with \\"Hard Times are Over.\\"<br /><br />Thirty years on, the irony and the pain are just as sharp. The album also has held up well in that time, with Lennon's love songs still comforting. Yoko, well, Yoko still sounds like Yoko. Her bird squalling just proves that she made the world safe for Bjork. \\"Kiss Kiss Kiss\\" still packs a good new-wave kick as well.<br /><br />But the main reason to check into this now is the second disc, \\"Stripped Down.\\" Yoko and original producer Jack Douglas have gone to the original tracks, scrubbed away almost any production sweeteners, bumped John's vocals into a more prominent place in the mix, and issued it as something John would have wanted. While I find this odd (Lennon is not known for that kind of production in the first place), it also makes one question the original album. Lennon was headstrong enough to be able to demand what he'd want, so was there a problem with \\"Double Fantasy\\" to start with?<br /><br />The remixes suggest not. One of the things that struck me on the original album were some of the production touches, like the three finger chime strikes at the beginning of the album (on \\"Just Like Starting Over\\"). They seemed to be an obvious pointer to the doom-sounding bells on Plastic Ono Band's \\"Mother;\\" a signal that Lennon had found lightness and joy since then. The harmonies are gone, which doesn't help either. The songs are now in a rawer form, more like demos than completed work.<br /><br />These changes just don't ring true. Like the 2004 \\"Acoustic\\" release, \\"Stripped Down\\" just seems to be clocking in on the mythology without adding anything to the history. The original \\"Double Fantasy\\" still merits the five stars, but the bonus disc is someone reinterpreting Lennon's vision and trying to pass it off as Lennon's own. Thirty years from now, it's the original album that will still ring truest in people's memories.e the three finger chime strikes at the beginning of the album (on \\"Just Like Starting Over\\").

B0036EH3WK|5.0|I must say that as an avid fan of lost I was going to buy this product pretty much no matter what. That said I was absolutely amazed by the quality of the product and the experience of the collectors set. The goodies inside are a bonus but what really amazed me was the experience the makers put into the Blu-rays. Lost was all about finding hidden things and secret information, the Blu-rays Don't disappoint on this aspect. The menus offer the ability (with a little button pushing) to find several hidden gems of behind the scenes views and featuretts that you have to discover for yourself. Not only do the blu-rays have hidden items but the box itself has hidden inside of it some information and extra features that I do not want to spoil for the other lost fans but i will give a hint, use the included UV Led pen and shine it on everything that came with the set. I must say that while the price is a little higher than I thought reasonable before I purchased it I can certainly say that I am surprised that they aren't charging more. It is definately worth more than I paid for it but I am so glad that I got it. I did get 2 sets of throwing sticks instead of 1 bag white rocks but thats ok as I am not going to play with the game that came with it.          To sum up. Buy this. Enjoy this. Share this. and hope beyond hope that they bring the show back or maybe expand on the job that Hurley talks to Walt about...
B00014X8KO|5.0|before you spend your money here go to Big Lots they you can find this movie in a special edition there and it comes with 2 discs all for only 3 bucks you cant beat that so if you live by a Big Lots go threw there DVD's and look for it i am sure you will find it i been to two of there stores around California and found about 3 copies at one and about 6 at another so if you want this film or just want to check it out don't pay this price go to Big Lots they also have other great animations there all you have to do is look.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|This record is really nice, I especially like Robert Plant's continuous freshness and wish to always go for something different...  It would have been easy to stick to Alison Krauss and have yet another album like Raising Sand, but it's not Robert's way, it has never been... So, new people around him and a different sound and yet another challenge...  The songs are all very nice, nothing too deep but all very fresh.   I especially like \\"Angel Dance\\" and \\"Monkey\\" and Robert sounds very like Mick Jagger in \\"The Only Sound That Matters\\", imho.  The only song I really don't like is \\"House Of Cards\\", but then you just can't like everything, can you?  A record I absolutely recommend buying!

B003YUC9JI|4.0|I was a big fan of the Karate Kid series of movies back in the '80's (okay, well not that one with Hillary Swank) and a couple of coworkers who had seen this one told me not to expect much with this film, so going in I wasn't expecting to like it so much. Plus, in many films I've seen with Jackie Chan, he can get a tad annoying in my opinion. However, this movie was nothing but a pleasant surprise! Yes, the story did drag a bit at times, and I thought they would have been smarter to have shortened it, nor do I think we needed the scene where we learn about Master Han's tragedy. It didn't really add anything to the story in my opinion, though I suppose it was told so that he appeared multi-faceted, not just the guy teaching Kung Fu to the kid.<br /><br />I was really surprised that they added a lot of details and elements from the first two Karate Kid movies into this film - the thing with using the chopsticks to catch flies, the kid doing manual labor to gain muscle memory for use in martial arts (you know, the wax on/wax off thing), they even managed to get a Chinese version of that d-bag from the 1st Karate Kid film - \\"strike first, strike hard, show no mercy!\\"<br /><br />The film did a nice job of recreating a lot of those details and themes from the Karate Kid (1984) yet managed to be its own unique film as well. The ending was great too, expected, but a nice take on the classic.<br /><br />FINAL GRADE: B+

At first I was hesitant because it was in the Young Adult section (I'm 37) and I didn't want to get sucked into another Twilight type addiction, but I just finished The Hunger Games this morning, bought the trilogy hardcover set from Amazon (great price!) overnight, but can barely contain myself from running to a book store and buying the second book today because I can't wait until tomorrow when the books arrive!

B00364K6YW|5.0|I rarely ever write a review, but when I saw the restored version of Pride & Prejudice, 1996, I had to share my excitement! I agree with many of you that this is the truest version of P&P on film.  I've owned every version of this film and this is clearly the best. The colors are gorgeous, the sound is true and the music is clear and beautiful.  If you're a fan of the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle edition, this is the edition you've waited for!

Its a loveAtFirstSong affair..it struck an emotive chord in me..  the details, layerings, outstanding clarity and AIR on this can is AMAZING!  The other headphones are clear n fast, clinical..but no heartpull.  Listening to music is about enjoyment for me.  So i have to get the AKG702 home.    Its very light v comfortable on my head...  i dun get the pain from the headstrap that some mentioned,  even after a few hours of listening.  the sound transition from bass to the highs is smooth..  with a big soundstage. At home i am using a FIIO E7 dac/amp..  sounds good actually,  but  i am just yearning to get a more powerful amp for this baby.  So i am saving up for an amp next...maybe a udac HDP :)
B003XX2PD6|4.0|Deerhunters latest creation is also their most accessible album yet. Basically, what I'm hearing here could have been John Lennon's lost album if he were backed by various members of the Velvet Underground and Jesus & The Mary Chain. Very poppy psychedelia mixed with a stubborn 60's Merseybeat garage vibe. Good stuff.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|I enjoy electronica music and I reviewed the Deadmau5 \\"For Lack of a Better Name\\" CD. Awesome album, by the way. Incredible! In any case, a rather pleasant series of comments followed including a few recommendations for selections which I might like. One of the Amazon reviewers, P Harper, said: \\"Gary! Gotta go with Daft Punk!!\\" Well, that's a good suggestion. Daft Punk appeared on my Amazon recommendations list several times and I appreciate the confirmation and the little boost.<br /><br />In looking over the Daft Punk selections available, I decided to go with a set of Daft Punk Alive albums for several reasons. One, they were a good deal. Two, I've never been to a live electronica concert and my prospects of going are very slim. I'm 74 and would probably feel very uneasy at such a concert. I used to go to New Wave concerts (Devo, Blondie, Oingo Boingo, The Beat, etc) when I was in my forties and I really stood out then. Can you imagine a 74-year-old guy at a Daft Punk concert? Sorry, I just can't take that much attention. Well, in any case, I really love the music, it's great to listen to at home and the Alive discs give me a good feeling for what an electronica concert might be like.<br /><br />The Daft Punk Alive 2007 CD is is overwhelming! It's one of the best live recordings I've ever heard irrespective of the genre of the music! Without question! It's just awesome! In a lot of ways it reminds me of a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album where your favorite band or performer presents all those songs which you have learned to love. The difference is that I've never heard Daft Punk before I bought this recording. I suppose it's a Daft Punk greatest hits assortment done up in bright new fashion especially for this dramatic occasion. The individual selections are masterfully chosen and seamed together into an almost continuous stream of melodic and dramatic music. It's real beat heavy and wonderfully melodic with a masterful blend of voices here and there. The sound is simply outstanding. Man, what more could you ask for?<br /><br />The sound quality on this album is particularly good. I listen to it on a 100 watt per channel receiver with 7 speakers including two 12\\" woofers and an 80 watt powered subwoofer. It's minimal as far as high-end stereos go but it's quite sufficient for my aging ears. I usually play it at about half volume (quite loud) as I like to feel the music as well as hear it. The recording is just awesome. I'd guess it was recorded in some type of cavernous venue and it has a big, full, vibrant quality and I love the audience and the way it responds to the music. If you like good live recordings, this one is hard to beat.<br /><br />Gary Petersonn, what more could you ask for?     The sound quality on this album is particularly good.

Every song is a winner and is still played in concert except \\"A Venture\\" which really isn't a bad song just not as strong as the others. The clairty of each instrument is apparent here. I'm glad I picked this up again and it's once again a welcome addition to my collection of Yes albums.

B00275EHJG|5.0|Some have said that \\"Toy Story 3\\" was the best one they came out with yet. However, I find all three of these films equally wonderful. With that being said, let me get back to this newest sequel. The imagination involved here is nothing short of amazing. All our favorite toys are back, along with new ones, friends \\"and\\" foes. The one that really made me laugh aloud was Ken, voiced by Michael Keaton. As a child, we all thought of Ken as a girl or sissy toy. Especially, those of us who had GI Joe, Mego DC/ Marvel heroes, or even Planet Of The Ape figures (*yes, I'm a gettin' old*) Funny thing is that this movie brought me back to those younger years when Ken was quite controversial  amongst the \\"Six Millon Dollar Man\\" action figure croud. And seeing him examined ~ so closely for the first time in media ~ was what I found so funny. The irony of Ken is that he has always scored the hottest doll ever, while most boys thought he was (is) gay. Anyway, most of the reviews here shall flesh out this instant classic. My advise is to simply \\"BUY IT\\"! This is one film that truly delivered, and shall keep on delivering for generations to come.
B002ZG99CC|1.0|This was a poor remake of a perfectly fine original which never should have been recreated.  It has a ghetto spin to it and does not deserve to even be titled \\"Karate Kid\\"  The original was not broke so no use in trying to fix it.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|I'm not going to spend time attacking Mariah on this latest release.  It's decent, but will never compare to her \\"Merry Christmas\\" album from over 15 years ago.  We understand that, so other people making comparisons need to get over it.  It's a nice companion if anything.  Vocally, I give her a B- because these are Christmas songs, which are about as comparable to singing Gospel in some aspects, and you can't give lazy vocals on such powerful standards.  She switches up between her lazy, whispery voice then into her full voice on some of the songs, which I've hated post-\\"Rainbow,\\" when she could've just sung at full voice throughout.  I mean, you have to take them to chuuuch and I think she understood that when she did the first one, but since she may not have it like she used to, I guess it's something we're going to have to deal with unfortunately.  While the cover is bootleg and a bit off-putting by her standards, the album is for the most part worth it.<br /><br />\\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town Intro\\" segues into \\"Oh Santa,\\" which starts the album off just right with a festive 60s/70s vibe that is a throwback to \\"All I Want For Christmas.\\"  I see this being another holiday classic for years to come.  \\"Oh Little Town of Bethlehem/Little Drummer Boy Medley\\" is a bit questionable when you hear the arrangement and how she chooses to sing; here she does the toss-up of whispery and full voice, as well as on \\"The First Noel.\\"  \\"Born Is The King Interlude\\" has a nice R&B slow jam feel to it and she hits a perfect head note at the end, but I don't know how appropriate the vibe is for the subject in my opinion.  But inbetween that, on \\"Christmas Time Is In the Air,\\" the whisper vocals work perfectly as she executes a sultry feel on the track that is perfect.<br /><br />I didn't even have to refer to the liner notes to know that James Poyser did \\"When Christmas Comes\\" because it totally sounds like him with the live instrumentation and old-school throwback, as well as it's striking resemblance to \\"Mine Again\\" from \\"The Emancipation of Mimi,\\" which he also did.  This will definitely make it to Adult R&B stations in the coming months.  Jermaine Dupri brings some funk to the album with \\"Here Comes Santa Claus/Housetop Celebration\\" that suits Mariah's feel-good mood.  The \\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\" medley was nicely done, another track where she incorporates the whispery voice and it works to perfection, but I think the \\"Linus & Lucy\\" piano intro at the beginning was unnecessary.  \\"Oh Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus\\" is nice duet with her mother, but she's outdone due to Mariah's strong vocals.<br /><br />\\"Oh Holy Night (Live)\\" was unnecessary in my opinion, and I'm a bit confused as to if all of the extra crowd vocals were real as well as the obvious treatment that there are 'live (pre-recorded)' vocals mixed with the original ones from the origianl track, but, whatever.  \\"One Child\\" again utilizes Mariah's mix of whispery vs. full voice, but it's a decent song.  The children's choir gets a little too redundant and reminds me of a Michael Jackson ballad/track with that addition.  \\"All I Want For Christmas (Extra Festive)\\" is just a bigger version in terms of sound and instrumentation from the original, mixed with a few ad-libs and harmonizing towards the last minute of the track that compliment it nicely.  Mariah's house version of \\"Auld Lange Syne\\" closes the album in the same upbeat attitude it began.<br /><br />Overall, this album is worth the buy if you're a fan, or a lover of holiday music.  Though I believe this was a rushed project so she can hurry up and get out of her contract with Def Jam like she did with the \\"Rainbow\\" album back in 1999, she still gave it her all.

When a new album surfaces, one of the fans, Duncan rights a fabulous review.  His girlfriend, not an obsessed fan like him, rights a more down to earth review.

B000026KGC|5.0|Back in 1969 a friend at college turned me on to Deep Purple, and 'Book of Taliesyn' was the album. I was a budding bass player, and fell in love instantly. The songs range from good to great, and their cover of Neil Diamond's 'Kentucky Woman' is as perfect as rock and roll gets. In the late '70s it was common for a fan to ask another \\"Ian Gillan or David Coverdale\\"? My answer was always \\"Rod Evans!\\"    For me this will always be the best Deep Purple lineup, but of course that's because it was my introduction to the band and my favorite songs they ever made, and your first is always the one you remember.    Bottom line: you can do worse than to own this album, especially this version with good mastering and bonus tracks.
6300216802|2.0|Star Trek TMP was meant to be a beautiful, an awe-inspiring and intelligent science fiction film that would transcend its cult tv-show origin; what the film-makers had in mind was something like a bigger, better version of Stanley Kubrick's 2001.  The idea, in the mold of more \\"serious\\" science fiction writiers, was to make a movie as technically realistic as possible given the constraints established by the original Star Trek universe (and of course a not-infinite budget).      Unfortunately, the result falls flat on its face on every level.  The visual effects were unfinished by the time of the release and the final theatrical cut was put together in haste; consequently, the middle portion of the film is consumed by overlong sequences of meaningless and unimpressive special effects.  The screenplay suffers from forced dialogue, which is often just embarassing (\\"bones, I NEED you\\"; \\"it's how we all FEEL Mr. Spock\\").  While some of the dialogue is intentionally cold and mechanical as part of the high-tech future atmosphere (e.g. betwen Kirk and Sonak, or that among Enterprise crew members in the first part of the film), much of the dialogue between the main characters is forced and mechanical as a direct result of bad writing and uninspired acting.  Whenever Dr. McCoy utters a line, one has the feeling that he's already said that, word for word, in some tv episode--except back then it made more sense.  The skeleton of the plot is an exact retelling of the season 2 episode, The Changeling (dramatically, the tv episode is far more successful).      Despite the numerous weaknesses, there is abundant evidence that the film could have been great.  The first hour of the film is by far the strongest part.  Through sweeping scenes and a majestic musical score, the viewer is hit with a forceful vision of a rigid technological utopia--but one where man's pursuit of the noble and the heroic is still (depicted as) possible.  Probably the best thing about the film is the music:Jerry Goldsmith's score here is of such power that it supplanted Alexander Courage's theme from the tv series as THE Star Trek theme.    But taken as a whole we can't excuse the film's shortcomings.  The Director's Cut fails to address some of the problems (with the dialogue and with unfinished visuals), and what is even less excusable, some of the changes (such as the computer voice) are ill-considered and misguided revisions of deliberate artistic decisions of the makers of the original.  It is ironic that as it stands, TMP would be a much better movie if the Enterprise were destroyed in the wormhole about an hour into the film.
B003405MF6|4.0|I love this CD. As softer jazz-fusion are my preferred selections from Jeff (in general), there are some wonderfully crafted soundscapes here...\\"Never Alone\\" and \\"Over the Rainbow\\" to name two; the latter I happened to listen to while reading Ken Sharp's wonderful book \\"Starting Over - The Making of Double Fantasy,\\" and I just about lost it.   Jeff's music on this CD gets into your soul as so much of the other stuff he plays (listen to \\"Diamond Dust\\" on \\"Blow by Blow\\"). Other favorites of mine here are \\"Serene,\\" \\"Nessun Dorma,\\" and \\"Elegy for Dunkirk...\\"  Do yourself a favor and buy this one.
0525951652|2.0|After Pillars and it's sequel, Fall of Giants was a gigantic disappointment that lacked imagination, intrigue, and creativity.  I believe Fallon put this almost uninteresting soap opera plot on the market as a way of feathering his retirement.  The book is a far cry from Pillars and I will not waste my time on the future books of the so called trilogy.  Fallon spent more time with soap opera like plots rather than researching and weaving a story around the happenings before and during the first world war.  Pillars is one of my all time favorite books and the dribble in [[ASIN:0525951652 Fall of Giants (The Century Trilogy)]]Fall of Giants pales in comparison.
