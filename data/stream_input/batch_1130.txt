B004KKYX9K|5.0|\\"Sing You Home\\" was another thought-provoking book from Jodi Piccoult but it was not too heavy as to be off-putting. The main character is believable even though she changes from being a supposedly happily married woman to going into a relationship with a female friend. Her trials with IVF made the reader identify with the expensive process but was not too onerous. At times the moral Christianity was painful but I understand that was who the male characters were: the ex husband and ex brother-in-law. Thought provoking and hard to put down
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This was always a great way to buy MP3s. Now the Cloud Player makes it a fantastic app. It was an easy process to upload all my music from both iTunes and WMP.  All the playlists are intact. And the interface is clear and easy to use.   I've had no problems with buffering,  even driving through mountains with weak and intermittent 3G signals. This app must buffer far ahead.   Overall, a great way to seamlessly play your music anywhere!
B000WTBMBK|5.0|Everything is perfect. I have nothing negative to say about it.   Get good speakers, listen, enjoy.  Burial's music is so unique.
B000006ZWD|5.0|It's been 15 years since it was released...a good time to re-listen to TWM. This may be my favorite of all of them and a good place for newcomers to be introduced to the band. Yes \\"Virtual Insanity\\" gets the hype for its video but this is a sophisticated, varied and accessible album that still sounds as fresh and fun as it did back in 1996.    Their first true foray into disco began with \\"Cosmic Girl\\", an unapologeitcally commercial and fun song, \\"Use the Force\\" went Carribean and \\"Everyday\\" and \\"Spend My Life\\" gave Jay Kay a chance to work the slow jams. \\"Alright\\" if you like your funk chilled and groovy, \\"High Times\\" and the title track if you like your funk a little more intense and \\"You Are My Love\\" if you like your funk more polished and sophisticated. While I dig \\"Didjital Vibrations\\" my only criticism is that I wish that \\"Didjerama\\" had been replaced by \\"Deeper Underground\\" from the Godzilla Soundtrack but I'm being really picky there.     Why does TWM gets the edge over Return of the Space Cowboy? For its inclusion of the two last tracks (British Version)the M-Beat collab \\"Do You Know Where You're Coming From\\" where its use of drum-n-bass positioned them in a modern dance context without sacrificing their sound and \\"Funktion\\" an old school celebration funk jam with great playing throughout. Just a great album to get to know this band!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was told abut this book from a friend of mine and was intriqued about the concept of a book Â«narriatedÂ» by a dog. This book took my beath away!  I could not put this book down, and after you read it you will see why.  It's fabulous.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|I missed seeing season one of the series when it was broadcast, and got hooked on it by watching the episodes on DVD.  I plan to pay to see the season two episodes online that I have missed to try catching up with the story. (It is crucial to watch the programs in order to understand the plot). This series is perfectly cast and has incredible dialogue, acting and music !  The stories are fast-paced with lots of twists, turns and and flash-backs.  I have been unable to get into the books now that I've seen the series on video, because unlike most movies or TV series, the video is so much better in every way. The characters and stories are absolutely addicting - even for older viewers like me. Fans of \\"Twilight\\" and \\"Moonlight\\" will love this series!
B000T0XEGS|5.0|The brilliance of the singers shines in great virtuosic performances by Teresa Stratas and Placido Domingo at the prime of their great careers.  As always, James Levine  and The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus are unsurpassed.  The film's really unique quality is the production and direction of Franco Zefferelli. i.  Could anyone surpass or even match  one of his productions?
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I love the new movie...Sucker Punch! To me, it deserves an Oscar nod in 2012. When I saw the trailers, I wasn't sure if I would like it at all. However, the high caliber film-making of Zach Snyder motivated me to see the film and I'm thrilled that I did as it was outstanding.<br /><br />With 3 viewings of this movie, I am convinced this is clearly one of the best movies produced in a very long time. Please disregard the so-called movie critics that are bashing this film. Keep in mind, these are the same jokers that went wild with praises to movies like Pearl Harbor and Blair Witch Project. Yes, CONSIDER THE SOURCE.<br /><br />If and when you see the movie, you will probably find a strange experience of actually talking about the movie. Talking about your own interpretations vs. your friends, etc. When is the last time you had that experience? And this IS a good thing.<br /><br />My guess is the Oscars will snub this movie due to the critics. Which is sad. However, don't let \\"their\\" idiotic opinions keep you from seeing this masterpiece.
B00466HN6S|5.0|Saw this movie today, and believe me, it's not just for kids. It was so funny, and just listening to my grandaughter laugh because her Grandma was laughing was priceless. Definitely a must see movie, more than once...can't wait to own
030726999X|5.0|This is one of those books that you can't put down.  Lots of exciting nuances to the story with excitement at every turn.
B000Q66JXA|2.0|I love the movie but the quality of the transfer was very depressing at times.  There were numerous points in the movie where the grainy speckled image looked like a copy from a video tape and not what you would expect to get from a Blu-ray presentation.  The whole movie was not grainy, some of the scenes where quite good, but some left me wondering if all the footage was transferred from the same source.  Still a great movie!
B003B8QS6S|5.0|Bears rereading..book came quickly and in great condition.  Will have my kids read it as soon as they are able to.
B004AUQV5E|4.0|This show is pretty good.  I was skeptical about it, considering some of the shows being aired on the same channel, but I was pleasantly surprised.  You won't get mind blowing action like Bourne Identity, but overall the action is great.  I occasionally have the urge for a good spy story, and this fit the bill nicely.  The acting is ok.  It can be a little dramatic at times, but this show is fun to watch, so I can easily overlook the sometimes cheesy acting.  Probably the most unbelievable thing is that Maggie Q is supposed to be super tough, but she's so skinny!  Otherwise, she's great, and works well as Nikita.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This was a perfect transaction.  I received my DVD in perfect condition faster than I expected.  Excellent Seller.  Thanks.
B0033QC0WE|5.0|Exciting, vivid, without becoming too sterile or shallow. A must have for any lover of this great music and who isn't?
0307588343|5.0|As a person who is thoroughly fed up with the influence and greed of our government and Wall St, I wanted to know how something of this magnitude could happen and why it happened. Not only did I get a first hand account of the culture and the disfunction of Wall Street, I walked away surprisingly with a great amount of respect for what these people do. With that being said, I am saddened by those who have no disregard for the part they played in the financial ruin of this country and people's lives. I also took from this book an appreciation of what can be possible when an individual has a great amount of diligence, drive, and determination. The author's own story is told tremendously with ease and humor. The book is by no means technical, but it gives you a good framework of how the Street works while taking a close look at the ethical issues that encompass the day to day aspects in this line of work. Different people will read this book for different reasons, but one will walk away with so much more than when they started with this book. This is a MUST read that will not disappoint! Enjoy!!
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This movie is awesome, terrifying, and thought provoking all wrapped together. This story is based on a german girl named Anneliese Michel who was possessed while away at college. Besides the name change there is so much truth to this movie. I have watched the German version \\"Requiem\\" and although good, it just doesn't have the bite this movie does as it was more in the drama setting. This movie will take you for one hell of a ride and leave you to choose in what you believe really happened. After this movie I couldn't stand it if I woke up at 3:00 A.M. haha the demonic witching hour. If you like this movie also check out any books about Ed and Lorraine Warren such as \\"The Demonologist\\", Malachi Martin's \\"Hostage to The Devil\\" \\"The Dark Sacrement\\" and if you are really interested in more info about Anneliese Michel(Emily Rose) read Goodman's \\"The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel\\"
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Works perfectly and is very easy to use on the g-tablet. i am sure there are some limitations, but i haven't come accross them in my usage.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|Admittedly, I went into this movie with very high expectations. Everyone I spoke with raved that it was a fantastic film. I was expecting to be blown away like everyone else. Unfortunately, I wasn't. The concept of this film is brilliant and fascinating. The manner in which they chose to execute it, less so. I didn't feel invested in the movie at all or connected to the characters in any way. From the beginning, the story is muddled and bogged down with the angst and personal drama of DiCaprio's character Cobb. I understand that he's the main character and that his motivations are the driving force behind the entire story. Unfortunately, therein lies my problem with this film. We are not offered any opportunity to emotionally connect with anyone other than Cobb. All of the other characters are nothing more than paper cutouts, not even quirky enough to offer the illusion of some development. We are meant to rely entirely on DiCaprio to make us care about the story. And in my case, DiCaprio is unable to garner my interest or sympathy. I've always felt that DiCaprio is overrated as an actor and this film did nothing to change my opinion of his skills. I honestly couldn't bring myself to care whether or not Cobb made it home. Also, the source of his personal trauma was fairly predictable from an early stage in the movie. Which wouldn't have been a big deal necessarily but it's unveiling is dragged out unbearably an din such a heavy handed manner that by the time it was fully 'revealed' what little interest I had in it was gone.<br /><br />Ellen Page's character served as the catalyst for Cobb's personal expositions...and little else. And it's not because she connected to Cobb on an emotional level or had any more depth than the other characters. It's simply because as an outsider, she offers the simplest method for exposition. She professes concern for the safety of everyone on the mission and says that she's going along in case Cobb's subconscious gets out of control. However, there is no indication whatsoever that she would be able to do anything for anyone if that happened and in fact, she never does anything more than stand around and whisper earnestly at Cobb- which has no effect whatsoever. If she had truly been concerned for everyone's safety she should've told them upfront that Cobb was a basketcase unfit to share his dreams with anyone. I suppose we're meant to assume that she's come to care about Cobb but I just don't get that from Page's performance. I feel no connection between these two characters and Page's delivery is consistently flat throughout the whole film. She has no solid character traits or motivations of her own. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character would've been a better choice to help Cobb- having known him longer and already being aware of his personal tragedy and motivations. And his acting was much better, although they certainly didn't 'waste' time developing his character at all. And what last thing about Page's character...her name. Ariadne? That's almost as bad as Bella Swann. I guess they thought they were being clever but to me it came off as ridiculous and heavy handed, especially in comparison to everyone else's mundane names. They may as well have called her Maze Guide Girl.<br /><br />In conclusion, this film relies far too much on one character to carry it, especially considering it's an ensemble cast. Obviously, there are many people who were able to glean more from DiCaprio and Page than I was. I imagine that would make this movie far more enjoyable. As for me, I simply waited for it to be over.there is no indication whatsoever that she would be able to do anything for anyone if that happened and in fact, she never does anything more than stand around and whisper earnestly at Cobb- which has no effect whatsoever.

B001BKG9SK|5.0|It is quite unbelievable that those guys simply get their instruments and play with no script at all. The three jams, available on the second DVD, are sensational. Maybe David Gilmour should release a double CD/DVD with these jams, I would certainly buy it with great joy. You will be able to witness the musicianship that those guys share, with smiles on their faces. Then, you must go to rest of the material on both DVDs. Be ready for wonderful versions of \\"High Hopes\\" (celestial with the orchestra) and \\"On An Island\\", plus the best version ever of \\"Echoes\\". Richard Wright will be missed, for his music and also for his \\"good guy\\" personna. Hopefully there are plans to release this material in the Blu Ray format. Happy to be on this planet, sharing my existence along with David Gilmour and his incredible talent.
B0000252YK|5.0|This album is without a doubt a great one! One of my favorites actually Loved all the tracks!! If your an Ozzy fan get fast!! ASAP!!
B001U9BRNE|5.0|David Foster is involved with bands and musicians that I could never imagine. But after watching this DVD (I got the Blu Ray version), I decided to look for his name throughout my collection of old LP's and there it was. His name appears in credits spread around many musical styles (Tubes and Cheryl Lynn, for example). The duets presented here are sensational, some of them unforgettable. Quality of sound and image is outstanding. A must buy!
B003Y3UNZW|5.0|The First Katy Perry song I heard was Hot N Cold, and I fell in love with her voice. The first song I head from her second album was Califonria Gurls, and I couldn't stop listening after the first line. She has amazing vocal tallent, and the lyrics are fantastic and catchy in Teenage Dream. Firework is my personal fave in this album, but all the songs are outsanding, and it is hard to pick one just one as a fave.
1439102724|4.0|Jodi has written another engaging novel. While I myself found that the story from Max's point of view difficult to understand, it will be great reading for family members who are religious and suffer some of the bigotry that often comes from the groups outdated views on what is a family. Plenty have written plot so all I want to say is that this book simply asks 'What is a family?' We all need to stop and consider the ingredients that make a family in 2011 and hopefully for some this book will assist them on that journey. I loved that the author did not self censure to avoid controversy on this topic, it should not require guts to write on such topics but currently it still does. So read and see what you think makes a family, is it tradition, or is it perhaps more about love and ethics?
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|One of the greatest love stories of all time.  I love the book.  I love the BBC version with Colin Firth, and I absolutely love this version!!!  The cast is amazing.  While the BBC version goes more in depth and stays a bit truer to the book this version keeps the feel of the book without some of the detail.      The biggest thing that this version has going for it is the cast.  Mrs. Bennet is not nearly as annoying here - she's actually a bit endearing.  Jane Bennett is actually prettier than Elizabeth which is nice given that it is one of the key points of the plot.  The chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is AMAZING!!!  And I really like Mr. Collins...okay I don't like him, but I like his performance.      The plot moves rather quickly and I have watched this dvd maybe 80 times in the past two years.  I love it!!!
B001E45XT4|1.0|The headset is just OK as the plastic is too stiff.  The Mic picked up all the sound but my voice.  The mic stopped working after only one month of use.    I would not recommend anyone buy this product.
B002NHIK1E|5.0|This show was recommended to me by a friend as I am a huge fan of both Twilight and True Blood. Vampire Diaries strikes the perfect balance and I was surprised at how fresh the show was since the whole vampire trend is becoming very overdone. Where the characters in Twilight are shallow, Vampire Diaries has much more depth to both the characters and storyline in general. True Blood can have too much gore and nudity for my taste at times, which this show does not. I can watch it with my family and not have to worry about it being too inappropriate. This show has the best combination sexiness and depth. Compared to most other shows aimed at young adults, this is one that you will actually enjoy watching.
B004GYY714|3.0|This is a great music player with hundreds of options that being said it doesn't measure up to the ios version that also allows you to record your music and playback.
B002VL4OC6|5.0|This is a great pocket guide for anyone who wants to understand the figure. There are tons of illustrations which are simple and do a great job of breaking down parts of the anatomy to the basic form. You should note that the illustrations are not super highly rendered drawings like in some other anatomy books (Artistic Anatomy, Anatomy for the Artist). If you want something super comprehensive you might want something else, but if you want something you can stick in your bag for figure drawing/sculpture class then this is a great buy.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I absolutely love this record! I am not a fan of hip-hop and have never bought anything by Kid Rock before, but I have gotten curious since both Zac Brown Band and Willie Nelson seem to be musical friends of his. Now I know why! This is pure southern rock ala Lynyrd Skynyrd but also more west coast like Eagles and Bob Seger and it fits Kid Rock perfectly! Hope he continues down this road! His voice is very good and reminds me so of John Mellencamp and Bob Seger in their glory days, that's a good testimony!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Great memories behind this great package!<br />Specially after reading JT's Biography \\"Fire and Rain\\".<br />You HAVE TO HAVE IT, JT fans.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|Anne Hathaway was simply phenomenal! I have a degenerative disease, and I thought that her ability to pin point all of the emotions that rule you in this occurrence was absolutely phenomenal. Definitely a must see.
1439196834|5.0|I gave this as a Xmas Present to a friend of mine who is currently on the \\"hunt\\" of a lady. I gave it to him as a gag gift but afterwards he told me it was funny as hell to read but if he tweeks some things to be less tv magic he is sure they will work. No feedback from the outcomes yet tho.
B004L3AR0K|2.0|REnted this the other weekend and I have to say, I'm sorry I did.  It was totally not what I was expecting.  It did have some \\"stupid\\" funny parts, but both of the main characters are capable of so much better. And I NEVER expected to see Anne Hathaway naked in almost every scene. It was ridiculous and very much unncessary in my opinion.  Basically all her character and Jake's did was have sex...ENOUGH! We get it...they do it ALOT! Next scene please.    This movie felt choppy, like alot was edited out, I don't know how else to explain it.  It didn't flow from scene to scene smoothly.  It realy didn't explain why it was set in 1996...I know why b/c of the drug Viagra, butI just kept waiting for the \\"14 yrs later\\" to pop up on the screen...it never did.    The disguesting brother that lived with Jake, just unncessary...when Jake caught him watching the \\"homemade movie\\" they had made was just disgusting, not even funny, just plain disturbing!    My husband enjoyed this movie...again, probably b/c of the boobs shown in every scene, but I certainly did not enjoy it.  Hated the ending as well.    Skip this one...or at the very least rent it for VERY VERY cheap!
0671449028|5.0|My mother and father used to read this book to my brother and I almost every night when we were little. We would beg them to read the book to us when it was time for our nightly bedtime reading. Now, 25 years later and with a toddler of my own, I knew this was one book we had to have in our collection. My son loves this book. Not only are the pictures cute, but the rhythmic rhymes make it easy to read and memorize...like a song or nursery rhyme. Although, the book I had when I was younger was a little different (had a song that the bunnies sang and a Cat lounging on the moon on the back page), it is still my favorite 'going to bed book'.
6305558167|5.0|Excalibur is a adventure-drama directed by John Boorman(Deliverance)and stars Helen Mirren, Nigel Terry, Nicol Williamson and Patrick Stewart. The film tells the story of the sword Excalibur and the rise and fall of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table and the eternal battle between the crafty wizard Merlin and the wicked Morgana. The only special features are the audio commentary by Boorman and a trailer of the film. Excalibur is one the best films I have seen in a long time, it is truly a great viewing experience.
B00430EQK8|4.0|Holy Smokes ... a mechanized modern aerial extravaganza by a Spanish company, with Brunhilde and Siegfried of very \\"ample\\" (and experienced) proportions, and the many extras of sleek configuration. The Valkyries are not exactly fair maidens. As stated in label, the \\"highlights\\" are excerpts from the 4 operas (\\"Music-Dramas\\", per Wagner), and not identified from which. One needs to be familiar with the plots to recognize the segments. Most of the action has the singers & actors flying all around the space over the stage, via cranes, hoists and such mechanisms. The additional features includes the developement of this wild production.
B004LSO6YI|3.0|I purchased this film based on a friend's recommendation, and the fact that I think Traci Dinwiddie is gorgeous and very witty in real life (I saw an interview). I wish I had rented it instead. Parts of it were very well done. There was definite chemistry between the two women, and the two lead actresses were really good. You could feel their attraction to each other, and I liked how the director made us feel the increasing sexual tension and attraction between them, so that when we finally get to their first kiss (the much publicized 'longest kiss'), it felt inevitable.     About that first kiss: I'm not a fan of it. Sometimes less is more. It felt too awkward in spots. I know directors stage these kinds of scenes to make them appear natural and romantic, but this one lost me about the time they got to the chaise. The position looked uncomfortable, and I found myself thinking about that instead of the kiss.    The biggest problems were the structure of the film and the script. There is a narrator -- Elena's best friend, Tyler, who is filming a video project about Soulemetry, which is another term for soul mates, but is Tyler's raison d'être and how he makes a living. Watching a documentary about the random documentary couples that keep popping up would be interesting, perhaps, but not in this movie. It distracts us from the story. Maybe that's the point, though. The plot is pretty thin, and the dialog is weak. Peyton (Dinwiddie) is supposed to be a successful writer (although she's written only one book about her agoraphobia, she lives in an expensive home, and doesn't appear to work). So it was a bit surprising when Peyton wrote such juvenile sounding letters to Elena.     I wanted to know more about what happened after Elena's husband found out, but it all happens off screen. They could have added a couple of scenes to flesh out the main story, and add some dramatic substance and depth, if they didn't have all the distracting narration and clips from Tyler's video. I also disliked the narration because it was a device for the writer to tell us what we're supposed to learn from the story, instead of letting us discover it ourselves. This revealed a lack of faith in the strength of the story itself.    Nicole Conn has certainly come a long way since 'Claire of the Moon,' which I thought was awful. I didn't hate Elena Undone. The acting was a lot better than in 'Claire,' but it's still mostly romantic fluff, and misses a great chance to tell a much more interesting and original story. My advice is to rent the movie instead of buying it, and lower your expectations a little from the big build-up this has gotten, and you should be happy.
B0046MVVOW|4.0|Since this album contains both `Animal' and `Cannibal' I just decided to post my reviews for both albums here.  There is nothing special that comes from buying this version other than you save a buck or two depending on where you buy it from.  It would have been nice had she given us some B-Side tracks or some remixes or something that validated buying the album, but then again, if you don't own either and want them both then get this one.<br /><br />First; `Animal':<br /><br />\\"When Ke$ha blew up the radio waves with `TiK ToK' I was kind of bewildered.  I mean, the song was catchy and fun to a degree, but she sounded BEYOND drunk and shallow to an extreme, and when she started getting nominated for Grammy's I was taken even further back.  I mean, she didn't seem to have a lot of talent.<br /><br />I finally got out of my own head and decided to buy this album and check it out.<br /><br />I get it now.<br /><br />I've been listening to this album (along with `Cannibal' and her new remix album) nearly non-stop for the last couple weeks and I'm still wrapped up in it.  It's flawed, sure.  There are some songs on this album that just don't work that well, but overall there is far too much good here to dismiss Ke$ha as a talentless hack, sucked into the media storm surrounding her strange sense of style.  She isn't just a `dirty little freak' given more credit than is due.  If anything, she isn't regarded as well as she should be.  This girl not only has a voice (stop acting drunk Ke$ha, you have pipes so use them more) but she has swagger that makes her songs infectious.  As much as I claimed to dislike her for so long, I NEVER change the station when one of her songs comes on since, well, I love listening to this girl.<br /><br />I mean, who doesn't find something strangely endearing about Ke$ha's onslaught of radio singles?  The albums singles aren't completely indicative of this artist as a whole (maybe I shouldn't go so far as to call her an artist) but it doesn't hurt the cause.  `TiK ToK' may be the worst overall single, and it's still a fun and flirty song that sticks in your head.  `Your Love Is My Drug' is above and beyond my favorite song by Ke$ha.  It is just so boisterous and bouncy and fun and insanely catchy.  It was one of the first POP songs I learnt to play on the guitar, and this was all before I admitted to myself that I liked this girl, the song is that good.  `Take It Off' is just such a ridiculously filthy club track that is filthy in all the right ways.  If this doesn't illicit endless hours of rave-like gyrating then I don't know what will.  `Dancing With Tears In My Eyes' is another side, a softer side, to Ke$ha.  It isn't her best trip down this isle (`Hungover', without doubt or question) but this side to Ke$ha is nicely constructed here.  It retains her catchy pop style, but it adds a layer of heartbreak that sits on her well.<br /><br />As good as the singles are, the rest of the album mostly exceeds her promise.<br /><br />My favorite tracks on the album, outside of `Your Love Is My Drug' include the lovelorn `Hungover', the vengeful anthem `Kiss and Tell', the achingly sincere `Blind' and the throwback jingle `Backstabber'.  `Backstabber' is such a cool change of pace, recalls to mind an almost modernized jazz feel with elevated club beats and feisty lyrics.  `Kiss and Tell' rides the same vein as `Your Love Is My Drug' in the musical department, this song taking a different lyrical approach (that of a cheating boyfriend).  The chorus is catchy as all get out and it is just a load of bouncy fun.  `Hungover' is soft and gentle and is the closest thing to `haunting' Ke$ha has on the album.  `Blind' is just beautifully constructed.  It shows that vulnerable side to Ke$ha, and strips away her trademark `drunk singing' and shows us what she can really do vocally.  Why wasn't this song a single?  Why didn't they introduce her as a more serious contender to the pop world?  She has more talent (vocally) than Britney Spears and yet whoever was in charge of her exposure botched that up.<br /><br />`Blah Blah Blah' is fun and fresh.  It feels a little dated, but in a fun way.  Ke$ha does fall into the whole `shallow' category thanks to her endless barrage of ill-advised lyrics, but it doesn't mean she isn't fun.  She's not as artistically focused as Lady Gaga, so she can't always get away with the density of lyrics, but she understands her audience very well, so it kind of doesn't matter.  `Animal' is a good song, but I think the remix album spoiled me, since the `Switch Remix' is just so brilliant.<br /><br />`Steven' is okay, and it is a different song for her (although the obvious Imogen Heap inspired opener is kind of obnoxious).  The song grows on you, but it just doesn't work as well as the majority of the album.  I feel about `Boots and Boys' kind of how I feel about `Beautiful, Dirty, Rich' by Gaga; painfully tacky by fun nonetheless.  `Party at a Rich Dudes House' is fun but dumb and does nothing for Ke$ha as an artist.<br /><br />`Dinosaur' is just bad.<br /><br />So, in the end, as you can see, I really like this girl.  There, I said it.  I know, it totally makes no sense but what can I say; she delivers.  If you are expecting something truly original or something that will stand the test of time then LOOK ELSEWHERE, but if you want some primo-pop that will get you moving and will surpass your expectations then sink into this one.<br /><br />It's far better than you think it is!\\"<br /><br />Second; `Cannibal':<br /><br />\\"Despite the fact that the Billboard Remix of `Animal' is superb and `Blow' is just, well, perfect; this album just doesn't do it for me.  There are only nine tracks here and the majority of them feel cheap and rushed and unfocused and nowhere near the level of surprise and excitement that I felt when listening to `Animal'.<br /><br />So yeah, `Blow' is awesome and just works like magic.  The bass lines are explosive and the overall energy is insane here.  Her best club track, period.  I love that breakdown at the end (\\"make it rain on em\\"), but the entire song is flawless.  The Billboard Remix of `Animal' has most of the haunting texture that was accomplished in the `Switch Remix' on her `Dance Commander' album.  It's eerie and complex and layered beautifully; just superb.<br /><br />`The Harold Song' is soft and pretty, and the chorus swells upward with perfect pitch, but it feels less entrancing than her better attempts at that vulnerable sound.  `Sleazy' is fun, although the remix featuring Andre 3000 is FAR better.  It's fun and flirty though, and so you'll enjoy it.  `C U Next Tuesday' is a different sound for Ke$ha and it works to a degree.  It isn't too memorable, but it has a dreamy quality that is kind of enchanting while you are listening to it.<br /><br />OK, I kind of like `Grow a Pear', although I have to say that it is the definition of tacky and doesn't really work, despite the pre-chorus being kind of brilliant (\\"you should kno-o-oo-oo-ooow\\").  It's a crazy song really, and for shock value it works (she says mangina, so she gets props for that) but it's also kind of beyond stupid.<br /><br />I like `We R Who We R' to a certain degree, but it's probably my least favorite single she's released.<br /><br />`Cannibal' has a nice beat and all but it's also just downright tacky with no real substance or point.  This is Ke$ha buying into what the media wants her to be; a trashy whore.  She is better than this, and she even shows us that in moments of the song where her vocals far outweigh the disgustingly shallow material.  The tribal beat is kind of cool, but I hate the thoughtless lyrical content.  `Crazy Beautiful Life' is also rather vapid to tell you the truth, but the bouncy `Blue October'-lite beat almost makes up for the content.<br /><br />This album would have been MUCH better had it had five or six more tracks with some substance.  I mean, this is kind of like taking what she did in`Animal' and cutting it in half, and you needed those extra tracks to make up for missteps and add that something special to the album.  Instead it comes off a tad halfhearted.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this works quite well and I have no regrets over indulging in some teenage pop trashiness that is far better than I expected it to be.awless.

B0041KKYEW|5.0|First of all, Natalie Portman deserves every acting award possible for her work in this film.  You could tell in the first five minutes that she completely immersed herself in this role, and this world.  Literally, one of the best performances by an actress I have ever seen.  Right up there with Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice, and Charlize Theron in Monster.  A great actress will make you forget you are watching a movie, and she surely does that, and more.<br /><br />I heard on the radio the other day that her ballet-double in the movie is saying that she did most of the work, and that Natalie didn't deserve her Oscar.  I have so many problems with that.  It really makes me furious.  What kind of person would try to ruin someone else's biggest accomplishment?  Obviously, jealousy is at work here.  Apparently, and I had no idea about this, an actress must appear in at least 80% of her role in order to win.  I'm usually very good at spotting body-doubles in TV and movies, and I could not see even one instance that didn't look like her.  I know they must have had a double that looks like Natalie, but I would be surprised if Natalie didn't perform at least 80% of the role.  And, even if someone else did every bit of dancing, the brilliance is in the acting and the emotions, not the dancing (although that is a factor).<br /><br />Anyway, this is the kind of movie that stays with you, long after the ending credits.  I would compare it to another movie with a similar premise, \\"The Machinist\\", starring Christian Bale (another brilliant performance, and you need to see it, if you haven't already).  You will be trying to figure out what really happened for days.  And you definitely will want to watch it again.  I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over!  It's that good.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|A friend of mine has been urging me for years to watch this film.  She considers it the best films of all time, and she knows my love of TCM and all things `classic cinema' and so she convinced me that I was going to love this film long before I actually made the time to see it.  Finally, I called her up and told her to bring it over.  It wasn't that I was trying to avoid the film; it was just that it wasn't a priority.<br /><br />I wish that I had made it one.<br /><br />There are some films that just have `it', that special something that captures a part of your heart and doesn't let it go.  Even more astounding than classics like `Singing in the Rain', and to a certain degree that `other' Judy Garland classic, `The Wizard of Oz', `Meet Me in St. Louis' has that.  Yes, from the film's opening frames, it was obvious to me that I had found love at first sight.  I watched with fervent interest until the film concluded and I wanted, right then and there, to watch it a second time.  It captivated me and left me spellbound.  The set pieces, and performances, and music, the glowing progression of character; the whole film was just perfect.<br /><br />The plot is a rather simple one, which is kind of how all `great' films start.  There is no need to lather on too much when `simple and honest' will do just right.  Delving into the lives of the Smith family, `Meet Me in St. Louis' takes snippets from a single year and allows us into their lives.  We fall in love with each member as if they were members of our own family; so when heartbreak rears its head in the form of an eventual move to New York, we cross our fingers and hope and pray that the move is cancelled.  Home is where the heart is, and their hearts (and ours) are firmly rooted in St. Louis.  Love comes and love goes for the eldest daughters in the Smith household, and that love plays a central role in the film, especially with regard to Judy Garland's Esther.  Esther is our star, our guiding light and the one character that makes the strongest impact.  In fact, I remember watching her descend the staircase early on in the film; watching Garland stroke all the childlike emotional complexities of this wonderful character.<br /><br />I was entranced.<br /><br />She was perfection.<br /><br />In the end I'm just in love with this film.  Since watching it the first time I've gone out and got myself a copy and I continue to laud and praise it.  My friend was right, this film is love.rongest impact.

0670022411|1.0|Previous one-star reviewers have covered more than adequately everything that is wrong with this book. I only wish I'd read them before I purchased it.  It is badly written, boring, and I had no idea there would be no resolution to the story. I will not read any other book in this series because I do not care in the least what happens to any of the characters. The author and the publisher should be ashamed to have published such dreck.
B004GYY714|4.0|This app is really cool. I find myself listening to it more than Pandora now. Not all the streams are the greatest quality, but there are so many to choose from that you can always find something to listen to. Galaxy S 4G
0920668372|3.0|Cute book but does not hold my 21 month sons attention.  The pictures are ok but not the best book I have found.  Will buy more Karma Wilson books instead of books like this.  Would probably be better for older children.
B003UESJFG|5.0|DreamWorks was able to pull it self back up a second time after the release of Kung Fu Panda.  MegaMind is a brilliantly made movie with a great story and a great message tailored for people of all ages.  I will not ruin the movie but its a definite MUST see and a keeper for ones collection.
B004SKHJF2|2.0|Always liked this app even when I used it back when I had an iphone. Then I tried Sound Hound and the accuracy and speed of shazam is terrible. Seems worse than when I first used it. Tried the same clips of the same three songs and shazam didn't recognize any. S.H. found all three with only recording less than 9 seconds of each. No contest.
B004A8ZWTW|5.0|Loved it.  Best \\"Jane Eyre\\" yet.  The characters were believeable and I liked how the story kept moving along, and didn't include every single detail from the book.  I wish it hadn't been so late when I saw it in theater, or i might have watched it a second time!  Michael Fassbender was the best Mr Rochester yet, and Mia Wasikowska is such a good actress that I could tell from looking at her what was going through the character's mind without paragraphs of dialog!.  I was glad that the movie left more for the viewer to figure out than past \\"Jane Eyre\\" adaptations. 6 stars!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's a cool game but what?  So cool you had to give it away again???  OK Amazon!  This is my crack!  I need a better hit!  Wtfudge???

B003VPWXRO|4.0|This was a very honest view of a life with an eating disorder.  It was very refreshing to see Portia not portray herself as a victim, in fact it was the opposite.  You could really feel the power that she gained with her eating disorder.  I always like a book that you wonder during your day \\"what is portia up to today\\".  This isnt a long book, but i only tried to read one chapter at a time, because i felt it deserved that kind of attention so that i didnt miss any detail.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|I like to see phycological thrillers, like Vanilla Sky, Butterfly effect, etc.  I had the wrong idea about this movie, I thought there'd me more to the story line than it really was.  Turns out this is NOT a smart movie, it's more like a porn star getting all the buzz for acting that I didn't really see.  During the whole movie, I either saw a scared, self absorbed snobb or a possesed idiot.  Natalie P hardly had any lines in the movie,it could have taken a couple of hours to learn her lines, seriously, this is what they call acting?  Nothing about this was brilliant, it really bothers me how all these critics end up giving so much buzz and making me waste 2 hours of my life.  I should not have paid for this either.  Honestly, I believe all the praises this movie got was for all the sex scenes and the girl on girl action(which I could care less about that).  Too bad there's not negative stars on the rating system, this is the worst movie I've seen in years!  If you want something smart, don't waste your time on this.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|If I could find a word - one word - to describe this movie... I don't know. SUPERB? No, that makes it sound normal, which it's not. MARVELOUS? That would degrade it. GLORIOUS? Doesn't quite fit. ALLURING? RAVISHING? ATTRACTING? STUNNING? GRAND? Maybe if we morphed all of these words, it would be just less than 1/1000th of the actual result: Suluvitrand... Yes - that's it!     Now, in all seriousness, this movie is probably the ONLY movie deserving of a suluvitrand grade. Just, close your eyes... well, no. Then you won't be able to see what I'm going to say next. Okay, close ONE eyes. NOT BOTH! One... and let that ONE eye shut you out of the critical world. The universe of wretched, black-hearted, unprofessional critics. That MAY have been a little too far, but come on! These critical critics have no idea what they're talking about! Listen for a second... I saw this movie yesterday and have thought of nothing else. Everything from the opening scene with a beautiful cover of \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and a montage of a family gracefully being torn apart (if that makes sense) to the final seconds of the ride. It's an adventure - all of your senses are pulled in here - the venturous visual effects are basically diamonds for your eyes; the superb soundtrack and sounds of the film are mind controlling and beauty for the ears; The fire and ice and pain and sorrow really grab you in a way that you can feel it. I suppose there really isn't too much to taste or smell unless you have popcorn and Pepsi on your lap, but everything else goes above and beyond and makes up for the hunger - not only for nachos with jalapeños and cheese - but for more! Two hours (exactly 120 minutes, actually) is just NOT. ENOUGH.     I want more. I'm not a begger, and certainly I'm not saying this film wasn't capable of giving me enough, but I need more. The acting is fabulous, and I have to say that Baby Doll (the star; Emily Browning) and Blue (Oscar Isaac) are very convincing and really the best. They control the screen like it's a game of chess - the two playing a game against each other: level expert. I saw this with my friend, who usually likes calmer things (calmer music, calmer movies, blah blah blah - I really don't understand it) and even HE was falling for this movie. In some parts I saw him glued to the screen when I looked over. This didn't happen a lot though, because I was in love with it even more, and forgot I was watching a movie at some points (which, let me say, is like waking up from that dream where you're a billionaire and then realizing you need to buy the groceries).     Now, I'm sorry, truly, but I had to get that all out of my system. I SUPPOSE I will tell you what the movie's about now...     It's raining outside - hard. There's a symphony of lightning and thunder performing a scary opera outside, but Baby Doll, who's sitting on her bed crying, isn't afraid of storms. In the next room, her mom is lying in her bed, dead. Her evil stepfather smiles sinisterly as Baby Doll and her sister sob. Later, though, that smile disappears when he finds out his name is nowhere in his wife's will. He sips down his troubles and does away with Baby Doll's sister, blaming her for the murder. This \\"crime\\" of hers gets her sent to the asylum with plenty of other girls that have to perform masterful dances to survive. \\"We're already dead.\\" says Rocket, one of the other leads, when Baby Doll plans an escape route. In a partially imaginary land, the girls must complete missions, which are just as dangerous, really, in their fantasy world as they are on Earth. This is the perfect risk that endangers them all by a man with a fully-loaded gun - Blue. Blue makes his money off of these girls, and if he can't have his money, the girls can't have their freedom. They need to escape now -- before payday...     SPC

1439102724|5.0|Jodi Picoult tackles the subject of gay rights, particularly the right to have children as well as the status of frozen embryos.  Because she writes from the viewpoint of each of the main characters, for the most part she is able to present both sides of highly controversial issues.<br /><br />I could sympathize with Zoe and her all-consuming desire to have a baby.  I agonized with her through the failed in vitro attempts and particularly the heartbreaking stillborn delivery.  Her husband Max was also a sympathetic character who wanted to do the right thing but always seemed to fall short as he battled his own feelings of inadequacy and often drowned them in alcohol.  Vanessa's story was also well-defined and added to the angst of the rights of gays to marry and have children.<br /><br />I thought the shortcoming of the book was that, hard as the author might have tried to portray both sides fairly, she took some unnecessarily cheap shots at the religious right.  I think she would have been braver had she portrayed those opposed to gay marriage members of a mainstream religion.  I felt she was slanting the case by making those opposed to gay marriage on religious grounds overly fanatical, while in reality, many mainstream religions oppose gay marriage.<br /><br />That being said, the book is beautifully written in lyrical language and filled with twists and turns to keep the reader turning the page in suspense until the very end.
0439023521|4.0|Back cover:  \\"Winning means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun...  In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the district in line by forcing them to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.   Sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before--and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.\\"      More info:  The story is told in first-person through the eyes of sixteen-year-old Katniss, and is well-written. It starts out somewhat slow at first but quickly gets to the point of the story--by the end of the first chapter the contestants for the Hunger Games have been chosen. After this the pacing picks up, and the author doesn't waste time adding in pointless filler, staying right on track with the story. There is plenty of action and suspense but very little romance. PARENTS: This is definitely a book for older teens since the plot centers around 12-18yr olds having to fight to the death on live TV. It's not gory, but it can be disturbing/frightening.      Recommendations:  This was a very intriguing read, but at the same time very chilling and disturbing. There was enough suspense to keep me turning the pages until the end, and there were a few very intense moments that had me on the edge of my seat. Now for the reason I gave it four stars...    *SPOILERS*  To me, surviving the games seemed almost a little to easy for Katniss. We see her hunting and looking for water and sleeping in trees more than fighting for survival against the other competitors. I wondered how the author would pull off her character being put in a position where she has to kill others and still keep her likable. Well, the first time Katniss kills in indirect--she drops a nest of poisonous insects on her enemies while trapped in a tree. The second time it is justified--a competitor has just killed the young girl she allied with so she kills him in revenge. And the third time it is merciful--when the climax comes down to the final competitor he conveniently falls to a pack of mutant dogs and after a night of being slowly torn to pieces Katniss shoots him to put him out of his misery. The way these deaths came about just seemed a little too convenient for the character. It's not that I wanted her to kill anyone, it's just that that was a huge issue in the story and it seems that she didn't really have to deal with that.  *END SPOILERS*    I recommend The Hunger Games but it definitely isn't for everyone. I really enjoyed it but I think I preferred the dystopian world of Lauren Olvier's Delirium.

1577314808|5.0|There are so many reviews here, I'll keep it brief.  This book is far and away the best book on mindfullness that I know.  The key to the book is that it makes mindfullness and meditation accessible.  So many other mindfullness books make it seem like drudgery, and \\"difficult\\".  I am not saying that attaining the highest levels of meditation is easy, just that it is relatively easy to achieve modest levels, and let it grow from there.    I would also recommend \\"A New Earth\\", also by Eckhart.    Jon Kabat Zinn's books are also not bad, but I don't find them as accessible at Tolle.
068987751X|5.0|This book is a favorite of my granddaughter, laughs at every page and wants to read it over and over, making the elephant appear and the lion roar!

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Writting a small review for last season of \\"The Walking Dead\\". Just the main points...one, great story..based on a great comic. Second, even without the zombies it's a great drama. Lastly, the fx on this shows its better then most movies and the actors are at the top of there game. If you dig \\"28 days later\\" (zombie movie that came out a few years back!) this show is just like that but better. five stars!
1550379151|5.0|This version of the story (awesome in any form) is like the special features section on a DVD!  I love the extra pieces that give you the story behind the story.  Those pieces are almost as interesting as the story itself!  This version does include the original story in the middle of the other backstories.  It's definitely worth it!

B004CR5TD0|4.0|The son of famed English session musician James Litherland (Leo Sayer) and a former Goldsmiths music student (a program known for producing some of the most successful English artists), 21-year-old electronic musician James Blake is the new hot buzz of 2011, having pushed his new name last year with an acclaimed trilogy of EPs that made their way around the hip ear circuits late in the year. Now, with his self-produced eponymous debut out on shelves, Blake has brought in even more listeners, thanks in part to the blog and web chatter his cover of Feist's \\"Limit To Your Love\\" has seen since being released as a teaser last November.    Listing his genre as \\"post-dubstep\\" and citing the xx as his primary influence, Blake if one of the strangest new artists to see universal buzz in a good long while. He is, if nothing else, maybe the most modern indie-level musician in the years, sounding not only like the xx at times, but also taking quite a bit from Bon Iver, Antony and the Johnsons, Mount Kimbie, Jens Lekman and Bon Iver side project Volcano Choir - all very modern sounding indie acts. Using auto-tune on every song so much so that it's a defining element of his sound, Blake has constructed oddball minimalist electro-pop songs that almost always feel mechanical and cold, only warming when Blake's deep, simple piano chords kick in from time to time.    My first two listens confused me, to be honest. I insisted that this was an Antony side project, and that Antony had just slapped a picture of some handsome young man on the cover to deepen the myth of some new moniker he was using to grab some new ears. But, supposedly, this is truly not Antony singing, though I have no doubt that Blake himself would even admit the influence. The music, however, does not remind of Antony or Bon Iver, instead sometimes sounding like a offbeat, minimalist take on Mount Kimbie's excellent 2010 record, Crooks & Lovers, even at times bringing to mind Fourtet's recent record, There Is Love InYou. But what makes Blake's record so worthwhile - what makes it work at all - is how drop dead serious his youth allows him to take himself. This is, by far, one of the most dramatic and morose sounding records I've ever heard, even when it's taking time to hint at dance floor rhythms.    \\"Limit To Your Love\\" is, for sure, one heck of a song. Blake breaks the mostly simple song into distinct sections, adding touches here and there that don't seem probable, but somehow do fine as a complete work. Despite being a true minimalist composition that mostly relies on a keyboard, a voice and a mess of computer tinkering, the song is so drenched in ideas that it just might be the kind of song that people talk about and reference for years to come. Another standout track, \\"I Never Learnt To Share,\\" further displays Blake's minimalist mastery, creating an argument that he is as much an Ideas Man-type producer as he is a young kid playing around on a computer with a bunch of hacked programs and - we have to assume - an at-least-somewhat-stellar voice.    Two weeks worth of listening, that's what it took for me to admit to myself that there is in fact something special about this record. Does it deserve to be the best reviewed album from the first quarter of 2011? Hecks no it doesn't; but James Blake does have a second generation Bon Iver appeal that makes it one of the Top 5 or so must-hear records so far of 2011. The real question is: will I be laughing at myself for standing up for this record come December, or will it continue to grow on me, and maybe even possibly go down as one of my very favorites of the year? That's the rub ... I really can't begin to guess how this record will age - could go either way. No doubt about it, however, if you like forward-thinking music and don't mind an excessive amount of auto-tuner action (and blips and ticks), give this record the few spins it takes to sink in.    Check out more of my reviews at [...]

B001AQT0OU|5.0|I have no idea how \\"exclusive\\" this Blu-Ray release of the long-delayed \\"Barry Lyndon\\" is, but we can be thankful that it's going to be available (as is \\"Lolita\\") as a stand-alone so those of us with all of Mr. Kubrick's film previously released in Blu-Ray will not have to go to the trouble of ordering the discs from Europe or buying a Kubrick box yet again. Which reminds me, if you haven't seen a short film called \\"Stanley Kubrick's Boxes\\" by all means track it down on the internet. It's a fascinating piece that provides much insight into how Kubrick thought and made films.
159420229X|4.0|Mr. Foer provides a very interesting read about the history of memory, and I found the arguments about the loss of text memorization affecting modern intelligence somewhat compelling. In fact the book is more about memory competitions and the personalities of the competitors; about savants and even ancient history about memory. I'm no scholar here so can't comment on how thorough his review is. It was enough for me.  His explanation of how some of the systems works was interesting, but I don't think enough for you to embark on the exercise without additional resources...but then that's doesn't appear to be his goal. It's an interesting story and I think well-written. His interview on the Colbert Report was well-done (I know, not the best place to choose books to read...)
B002ZG9774|5.0|I didn't get to see this movie in the theater and I had been putting it off to rent at the RedBox because I just wasn't sure I'd be all that interested in a musical based movie.  I am not a big fan of musicals... although I don't knock them... just never really been into them.  Well I am a fan of both Cher and Christina and decided to just go for it and rent the movie because I knew that even if I didn't care for the movie these two ladies would at least entertain me with their musical talent....... let me tell you I was insanely hooked on this movie after watching it the first time.  I loved Cher and her characters sassy attitude and was pleased to see that Christina actually has some acting talent.  The movie has a very nice cast of great actors/actresses and while the movie's theme about a small town girl going big star overnight might be old this movie does not disappoint in the entertainment category.  The whole movies is beautifully filmed.  The song selections and choreography is fun and Christina's vocals are extremely powerful.  I am so amazed that such a powerful voice can come out of such a small lady lol.
B001SN78JO|4.0|Best Jim Carrey movie in quite awhile.  Zooey Deschanel is so easy to watch.  This movie isn't meant to reflect real life characters, but it is entertaining, a feel good movie without any nasty characters.
B004M8KLYQ|5.0|I deliberately wanted to listen to this release for a month before commenting.   Have to agree with the reviewers pointing out the artistic and ethical value of the lyrics.  One element that surprised me a bit is how enduring the melodies are - they have stuck in my mind and replay themselves at different occasions.  Ultimately some of these songs may end up as an important part of our cultural folklore - I'll let it for the listener to decide which.

B004SQS9FA|3.0|This is the next in the Radiohead ambient series, continuing from Kid A, Amnesiac and In Rainbows. For musical value, I put this somewhere between In Rainbows (very focused and enjoyable)and the others(much less so). It's kinda pleasant to have in the background but isn't really making a lasting impression.  Would I like to see them make another rock n roll album someday? Hell yeah, they were the best at that, bar none.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Definitely worth a buck. A simple concept game that is surprisingly fun and addictive. I would like it better if there were levels so you wouldn't have to essentially &quot;start over&quot; each time you play

0756404738|3.0|I'm with people who consider book one a solid 4, maybe even 5 star novel.  A fun read with some exciting new characters.  This offers much the same as the first book, but in a more drawn out way.  This isn't so much a novel as a book of short stories.  I really feel like you could trim out entire episodes in this book and take nothing away from the overall story.  And the scenes that were there in many places just dragged.  If this book were 300 pages shorter, I'd give it four stars.  There is no reason this should be one of the longest books I've ever read, because it sure as hell isn't close to being the longest on substance.    The guy obviously has a skill with words, but it's getting to a fault at this point.  Metaphors are cool, especially when they are this well crafted.  One is enough though.  There are countless occasions in this book where we are given three or four metaphors about the same thing.  I can see no point to this except to prove how savvy the author is with metaphors.  More substance, less flash please, a theme I just couldn't get away from in every aspect of this book.    Which brings me to my next point.  In this book, much more so than in the first, there is a feeling of a man trying to write way beyond the scope of his own experiences.  Between Denna, the girl he just can't get,  and Kvothe suddenly turning into the pimp of the world, I just got this picture in my head of a long bitter, life-long nerd trying to live vicariously through his character.  We've all known that guy who spent all his time chasing one girl who just wasn't that interested whilst not getting any others.  Well, now that guy has written a book, and now he has himself getting tons of play on the side.  I'm not saying that must be the case of Rothfuss and Kvothe, but it was a feeling I could not escape while reading it.    In short, my take is that Rothfuss should focus more on story, and less on doling out life lessons.      In disagreement with many other reviews, I was glad to see him get away from the University for awhile, I only wish it would have progressed the story more.  I'll read book 3, but if it is this long and this uneventful, I'm done with the author.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This app showed up on my Droid Incredible with the Froyo update.  I was furious!  I had never purchased a single song from Amazon, yet here's this app for them that I couldn't remove?  My opinion changed with the introduction of the Amazon Cloud Drive and Player.  I bought my first Amazon album to get the free $20 worth of storage space and started to upload all of my music to the Cloud.  Be patient.  It takes a long time (about 4 days, for me) to upload my songs.<br /><br />The app works just fine.  It is easy to create/delete/edit playlists.  The store portion is easy as well.  It even shows the free song of the day!  I haven't had any problems with playback, either.  My only suggestion to make this better is to have several widget options.  I want one that is full screen and displays the album art of the current song.
B00006AW2M|4.0|What is there to say?  A classic and unique Rolling Stones, \\"must have\\" album.  The tunes sound better than ever.  I only wish they had included the 3D hologram photo from the original album cover.
0201633612|3.0|This book started (follows?) a revolution in software design and is a must read for that reason.  However, I'm not sure the additional levels of abstraction they advocate in the introduction (and that motivate the use of many of these patterns) really lead to more robust and maintainable code.
1608870081|5.0|Absolutely the best pop-up book ever.  Incredible detail from the movie with several small surprise pop-ups.  Even after many uses, the pop-ups work very well; no binding or jamming.  Will keep a child (and adult) occupied for hours.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great Movie, Great Cast!  They pulled it off big time.  First movie I've seen in a long time that didn't make me feel like I was getting ripped off!  Kind of cheeky, but that's the beauty of this film.  The good guys pulled it off without the feeling that you had seen this movie adapted from hundreds of the same ideas rolled over and over.  You can't help but smile!
B00005JMJG|4.0|This was a pretty good movie that could have been much better. It has an interesting premise that I won't give away in case you haven't already heard. (The scene where all the patients are in the waiting room clutching onto their stuff was one of the funniest in the movie.) This movie is one that rapidly transitions back and forth in time. Kate Winslet's hair color was used as a clever way to help keep track of where we were in time, but for me it wasn't enough. That lack of orientation together with the rapid time shifts made me feel almost motion sick at times. It takes a huge amount of acting talent to play a depressed personality and be engaging. Jim Carrey who has an incredible range of emotion and facial expressions in his comedic roles was flat here. Pretty much the one look. I'd give this 3 1/2 stars.
B004EQAVHI|2.0|I watch and love many depressing and disturbing movies, dystopian or not, and I was hoping this would be another sad but eye-opening or maybe deep and heartwrenching film that sticks with you long after you've watched it.  Not so.  The movie has a good build-up, that's for sure. It keeps building, and building, and... it ends.  No plot twists.  No resolution, not even a falling action...not even a climax.  The thing builds and builds, and just ends!  I feel like I watched a pointless story with really no ending.  They grew up and all did what they were bred to do and that's it.  Afterward I was left wondering, \\"Why did I even watch that?  Why was that film even made?  Was the book this much of a dead-end too?  If so, why's it supposedly so celebrated?\\"  The movie went nowhere.  I have read that this film displays the difference between British & American filmmaking and if that's true then, I guess as an American I want alot of plot in a movie, twists and turns, rises and falls... and I guess the British are just happy with a story.  ...where nothing really happens except the natural progression of things.  A bit of a bummer because I was hoping for something that really grabbed or disturbed or at least preoccupied me, but unfortunately it didn't happen.
B000003S5H|5.0|Heard this cd on an I-POD tied into the sound system of our lobby, I really enjoyed the sound, so I located the I-POD and found the information, great music to listen to on a nice quiet day.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|I cannot believe they let this director butcher a great book, nah a great series like that.  Rowling's should sue for defammation of character. HARRY!!  Nothing, absolutely nothing followed the story and that was my favorite book of the series.  Too bad, so sad.  I hope they have another director for the last one. If you haven't read the books, don't bother to see this movie.  If you HAVE read the books, DON'T BOTHER TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele just sings my soul and I'm sure millions of other people on this entire album. She goes through the whole range of emotions in relationships from \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" to \\"Someone Like You\\". If you're looking to fall in love with a new artist lately and you aren't familiar with Adele, buy this album and you will be hooked. I can't think of another vocalist out there right now that has the depth and range that she does.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It takes good imagination to come up with ideas like the Angry Birds line. The game is fun and I think the entire idea makes for interesting game play.
0385474547|2.0|I found it a bit weird reading this for a class I would never think my teacher could give me such a slow developing story (teachers are supposed to keep you engaged in reading, not drive you away from literature (or bore you to death). Nonetheless, it was for my world history class, I HAD TO READ IT.<br />There was no choice of reading something else, it was either that or get an F. Which comes to another point in our education system but it is a point entirely off in a tangent. :)<br /><br />So back to the book review ¡K.<br />I think it is a solid 2 stars in the writing style. Achebe has an ingenious talent in exposing African culture to readers, but his slow writing structure, poor story development, turned me off from recommending this book to anyone. I consider, that his writing was done on purpose by the author to make you visualized an atmosphere of a world that runs very slow, life is stagnant, things are done in a certain way and ritualistic.<br /><br />I like gratification when I read a story, this one did not do it for me :(. which is then reason for my 2 stars. The book does have a scholarly teaching. As I read it, I did not understand many of the deeper messages that the book was conveying. Then again I can blame the teacher for not going in depth in the book, I had to figure them out the SLOW and PAINFULL WAY.<br /><br />I consider there are better books of African tales; to me this is NOT one of them. The book was solid written and well thought out.<br /><br />The book was not bad, it was actually very interesting, but you really need to like this genre to truthfully enjoy it, I am more of a fantasy reader.
B004NSULHM|5.0|Ok, if your on the fence just go ahead and click that order button right now. Huge Radiohead fan and own everything they have released but still not just another lp. Bought the vinyl version and the recording is top notch. The value is amazing as well, under 14 dollars shipped you get the vinyl version and a free mp3 download for your iPhone. Radiohead should be applauded not only from making great music but also for not ripping of their fans. Another solid recording, can,t put it down.
B002ZG976U|3.0|I gave this film 3 stars because the singing and dancing was out of this world great.  Christina Aguilera has a voice that comes along once in a generation, and who knew that she could dance as well?  With this package I'll overlook that C rated acting skills.  As the star of this show, Christina gives it her all and that's a lot of star power.  She lights up the screen with her talent, though the writers of the script didn't give her much to work with.  Christina is a small town girl ready for the big time who seeks fame and fortune in L.A., who happens into a burlesque club owned by Cher.<br /><br />Now, if you've seen Coyote Ugly, you've seen this movie, so don't go looking for something new and original, but what Burlesque does give you is a feast for the eyes.  Obviously all the money that was spent on making this movie went towards the costumes, choreography, and sets, not the writers.  In fact, I would guess that writers of this movie must have been relative(s) because the characters' development and the dialogue are painfully awful.  Cher's character is tough as nails one minute, and crying like baby the next.  Christina's character is innocent one minute, and worldly-wise the next.<br /><br />Christina's love interest, Jack, comes off a guy who's been around the block, and as a bartender at a Burlesque club, you'd expect him to be, yet he buys Christina a drink right away, and offers to vouch for her if she needs a job reference.  Huh?  Does he do this with every attractive female who walks into the place? Or is this just lazy plotting.  In the beginning he wears enough make up to be mistaken for a drag queen, but once its established that he's not gay, and this is just for laughs, he lightens up on the eyeliner, and then stops wearing it for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />And for an innocent small-time girl, Christina starts off the movies stealing from her 'evil' boss, but tries to give the other waitress part of the stolen money to buy her child a bike.  Then she closes up the restaurant and sings her heart out.  So what kind of diner closes in between lunch and dinner?  None that I've ever seen.  Again, another lazy plot device so we can watch Christina sing. Again, wow, can that girl sing!<br /><br />I'm not sure what all the shots of Patron were about except maybe as product placement because they didn't seem to have any other reason for being.  If drinking were important to the movie, and there was one gal with a drinking problem, then just a shot glass or some stumbling around on the dance floor, could have gotten the point across just fine.<br /><br />I thought the movie was way too long.  Since the story was pretty much an after-thought, the writers should have just gone with the singing and dancing numbers and cut most of the dialogue out.<br /><br />All of the stars I gave this movie are for the singing and dancing.  Even Cher sounded better than I've ever heard her.  Both Christina and Cher are legends deserve better writers.e.  Then she closes up the restaurant and sings her heart out.

075640407X|5.0|I don't think there are words to do this book justice. From the numerous quotes that still bring emotion to me after several readings, to the wonderful lingering feeling of a good book that just sticks with you when you are finished. \\"Name of the Wind\\" is a marvelous novel that I recommend to anybody who is looking for a well written, thought provoking, beautiful book to read.    Male, female, fantasy lover or hater, this book is just fantastic.
B004L3AR0K|3.0|I really thought I would love this movie and couldn't wait until it was available on DVD.  We rented it recently and I thought the story was pretty good and I really liked Jake Gyllenhaal.  However, I couldn't get past all of the \\"pervasive language\\".  It REALLY took away from the likability of the movie for me.  Also there was more nudity than expected, mostly females, which I don't appreciate.  Anyway, if you're not offended by these things, then you'll probably like it, but for those of you that are more sensitive to these things, be forewarned.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|very good movie i love John Cusack great actor they did a great job with the effects ive watched it over and over again
B00005AQE8|5.0|I can play this from beginning to end multiple times. Exactly how I remembered it when it first came out.
B002VECM6S|3.0|good movie to buy for the money.got it as a christmas gift and they like it.they wanted this movie for a while.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I certainly think it should have been longer than 6 episodes, but I will get over it.  The first two episodes ROCK (special effects are excellent), then it slows down too much for my liking (I realize they were trying to develop the characters so we would care when bad stuff happens, but you need to keep the pace up too... this is what happened to Heroes, it started to drag), and then picks back up a bit in the final episode (loved the CDC story line).      Is it perfect, no - but I am willing to hang in there while they find sure footing.  I have hope that season two will be scarier, faster, and (of course) longer!
B004B8DH98|1.0|If ever there was an American snooze-fest, this is it. What a waste of $4. It opens with Clooney looking like he did in Syriana, but at least in that film you knew who he was, what he was doing, and what was happening with the plot. In The Mechanic the plot was clear and Bronson clearly cunning and ruthless, but cultured. In the Day of the Jackal the target was always looming as the objective as the assassin thrilled us with his clever strategy. In this film we don't even know WHO the target is, ever. This film opens with three killings, one especially horrific at learning it was UNnecessary just a few minutes later and it immediately becomes a listless plot and film, as does Clooney's role in it. Long rides, boring panoramas, solitude, arcane meetings and drone-like conversazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...this is why Amazon give you 48 hours to watch it - you will fall asleep a third of the way through then awaken not wanting to watch the rest of it, but you do anyway and your suspicion that it doesn't get any better is right - it doesn't. Even the sex scene is done with a terrible red filter which blurs the only great visual part of it - the sheer, truly genuine beauty of the Italian strumpet that loves him (yet he's not a client - go figure). Then, of course there is the boss and equally bland priest, neither of whom seem to have any relevance to whatever is happening. And, as if there is some saving grace by praying for a great ending, NOT! Its typical, predictable, and empty. Save your money. Clooney needs to snap out of it - he can do much, much, much better. I give it one star ONLY because I know he can and will.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|I agree that Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond. Even with the poor storyline I would watch this movie because I enjoy his portrayal. I also agree the ridiculous storyline about wanting to control the some water supply is weak and contrived and that there is nothing memorable about this movie.   I was saddened by how uninteresting this film really was, even with Daniel and the action sequences... and I'm pretty lenient when it comes to story if the action is good and the eye candy acceptable ;-). So for me to say I probably wouldn't watch this again unless on a bet is pretty bad.  I guess I'll just have to rewatch Casino Royale until the next Bond film comes out... and pray they have a better story line!
B004PA50JM|5.0|The producing is clean but not to the point of manufactured product, and the chord progression is tight and can be counted on! For a band that could not find confidence after loosing one of the main players has now found it, and now I hope it is their new normal!
0756404738|1.0|Like all the Rothfuss fans out there, I was exceptionally excited to get this book, and purposefully reread the NOTW to refresh my memory. I still rate NOTW as one of the best Fantasy novels I've ever read, and much of this was due to Patrick Rothfuss's phenomenal imagination and innocent writing style.<br />By the end of WMF, I was cursing this same author for transforming my love of Kwothe to absolute annoyance and irritation, and had to force myself to read the last 100 pages. This book felt so overworked that it lost much of the innocence of the NOTW, and the infantile projections of hero worship onto the main character became more annoying as the book progressed. What started out as brilliant adult fantasy has now progressed to juvenile projections of an alter ego, and has left me feeling thoroughly disappointed.<br />Will lastly mention the I desperately wanted to love this book, but if you want intelligent adult fantasy then rather move on to Steven Erikson
0688091717|5.0|My daughter loves this book.  We had another copy of it and it got damaged so I found it on Amazon and she was so happy to get another one.  The story is really great.  All parents should add it to their children's library.  Love It!!

0439023521|4.0|As near perfect as a book can get: a sharp, spunky heroine, well built futuristic reality, suspenseful action, engaging supporting characters, and (best of all from a YA novel) well-written prose. The author does not talk down to her younger readers, nor is it unnecessarily complicated. The dystopian future, while slightly far-fetched (do all the people of District 12, formerly \\"Appalachia\\", live in such a small area that they can all be on hand in the town square for an event?) is believable enough so that you don't get bogged down too much with trying to figure out the nagging little things about it. You're too swept up in the story, actually. That's really the best thing about this is that it is addictive. I almost literally could not put it down. When trying to engage young readers, this is absolutely your best bet. It's a bonus that adults will be just as intrigued. Okay, now, off to read the next one. (I heartily recommend buying all three at once, because if you don't you're liable to find yourself at Wal-Mart in the middle of the night purchasing sequels.)

0439023513|5.0|Katniss' story concludes, and it makes me sad. The whole thing is so addicting and horrifying and hopeful and heartbreaking. You want happiness and peace for Katniss, yet you know that more terrible things will happen before she can rest. She's such a strong, respectable character, and I loved reading about her. Even in her weakness, she was genuine and striving to be better. I don't have much more to say that hasn't already been said, and much better than I could put it, so I'll just add my voice to those who highly recommend this series to everyone ever.
0756404738|3.0|There's no doubting that Patrick Rothfuss is a masterful and innovative author.  I absolutely adored the first novel--the Name of the Wind--despite maybe a little too much reliance on the same characters.  But, everything else was fantastic and I loved that it's told in first person by a jaded, shameless self-promoting survivor type.      Wise Man's Fear had a great story arc and the makings for a great novel, but I feel like he stopped after the third round of revisions.  Some of the dialogue was painfully corny and the plot was terribly contrived in areas--it felt like it was taken out of the play book for the Fantasy Writers Guild or something--Act 3:  insert evil adviser to the king;  Act 4:  Insert fairy goddess.  I'm somewhat disappointed because he had the chance to write such a dynamite book here and it's as if no one bothered to point out one of a number of obvious areas for editing.    Despite that, I still love this guy as an author and I hope he does it better the next time around.
0439023491|5.0|The story of Katniss continues and though she's survived one Hunger Games, the situation only becomes more dire as the districts prime for revolution. It's still up to her to make sure her loved ones stay safe and alive.<br />Her romantic dilemma, choosing between Peeta and Gale, is only more difficult with both of them in close proximity. It's still important to keep up appearances that she's hopelessly in love with Peeta, but now that he's aware it might have just been an act, it becomes more of a strain -- and more compelling to read about. Katniss is honest with herself, but her prevaricating becomes tiresome at times. Fortunately, there's some dire peril to distract her every couple pages. These books are addictive, but heart wrenching. You will run the gamut of emotions if you're the type to get invested in characters. You will also get no sleep for a week because it's impossible to put them down. Fair warning.

BTW Amazon return process is hassle free!!! 5 stars for Amazon.
0061148512|4.0|I expected The Bell Jar to be much more depressing than it turned out to be. Esther has won a short story contest the prize for which is a month in New York as a guest editor on a popular ladies' magazine. While in New York, Esther begins to feel the lethargy of depression creep in and feels that she is squandering her wonderful opportunity by just wanting to escape. When Esther returns home, she falls deeper into depression until a suicide attempt lands her in a hospital.<br />Ester is also quite a burgeoning feminist. She bemoans the possibility of ending up tethered to a man and having her personality subsumed by him. Page 69: \\"And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant dinners a man showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs. Willard's kitchen mat.\\"<br />I would have appreciated a deeper understanding of the root causes of Esther's depression. It seems she skims over the surface of her experiences, telling about events and feelings, without ever illuminating us as to the underlying issues. According to the end notes, Plath's mother wanted to prevent the book's publication in the states. Apparently some of the characterizations were quite thinly veiled, and Mrs. Plath was concerned that people would take offense. This might explain why Sylvia chose not to go deeper.<br />Also according to the end notes, at the time of her suicide, Plath was working on a second novel based on her experiences since being discharged from the hospital. I would very much like to have been able to read this book. According to Wikipedia, though Plath's husband, Ted Hughes has some manuscripts and journals that were not to be published until 2013. Hopefully, these works will then be published.

This first effort by a band wanting to be a keyboard/bass/drum band works quite well because it is fresh, diffrent at the time of its release and not burdensome or laborious like the majority of what is to follow from them. Overall, for me personally, a guitarist would have made this band much more acceptable or approachable. You have to be in a classical music mood to listen to this group. If you like typical progessive rock music (that has the guitar as a major componnet of the music), this band will probably not appeal to you very much--stick to, as I do, Rush, Yes, Genesis, and King Crimson. Over the years, I've tried very hard to accept Keith Emerson's keyboards as a \\"guitar replacement\\" or \\"substitution\\" but it just does not work for me. I'm aware that Lake plays guitar on some tracks throughout the bands career but it isn't enough; more guitar is definitely needed.This is the best of all Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's releases because Emerson's playing is not intrusive nor tiresome as it can get in releases such as Tarkus and Brain Salad Surgery. Having a guitarist to play off of Emerson's keyboards would have made this bands' longer pieces more orchestrated, complex, stylistic, and adept/articulate. In my humble opinion, the guitar would have made this mediocre band a phenomenal one but it was not to be. Emerson, Lake, and Palmer are more of a \\"classical/rock\\" blend rather than the progressive rock band that they have been labeled with. There's no doubt that their ability to play, that their musicianship is admirable but they fall short because something is definitely missing.
B004GYY714|4.0|Love all the stations and the archives of various shows. For the most part it works really well but ever now and then it freezes while trying to open a podcast and I have to force close the application.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|Ok, so I saw the previews for this movie in theaters and I was so excited to see it. The previews made it out to be this rip-roaring action film, combined with the paranormal and emotionally moving scenes of people coming to understand the meaning and purpose of life and to not fear death.  What I got was a bunch of random nonsense that didnt amount to anything in the end. This movie was boring as hell. It was painful in the way it kept going on and on and going NO WHERE. It is more about the lame old everyday events of the here and now as oppossed to the Hereafter.
B0012FCEVA|4.0|\\"I'm Breathless\\" is Madonna's take on 40's big band type popular music; this was definitely a change of pace for the singer who was at the absolute peak of her unparalled, immensely successful music career.  The songs are not meant to be as philosphical or as etherial as some of her future works would be; it does, however, make the listener smile and is relatively easy to enjoy.  It is a fun and contagiously entertaining piece of work. It delivers the goods on so many levels, especially in Madonna's markedly improved vocal range. This album was many years before the ground-breaking \\"Ray of Light\\" album and  several years before the \\"Erotica\\" album (both were landmark albums for vastly different reasons).  Madonna with this ablum proves mostly that she can succeed on any project with which she is attached. It also speaks of her fearlessness and desire to never repeat herself musically.   Madonna must have been keenly aware that this album would probably not be as appealing to her young audience, but it seved as a major marker for what was to come for the \\"Material Girl\\" (\\"Evita\\").  This album boasted huge sales for an album of songs inspired from the film \\"Dick Tracy\\".  Due to Madonna's superstardom, this album sold over two million copies in the United States and over 7 million world-wide.  By the standards of today, that would be considered very solid album sales.     \\"I'm Breathless\\" evolves as it progresses from 40's inspired songs including \\"Sooner or Later\\", \\"Hanky Panky\\" (which reached number 10 in the United States) and \\"More\\" to 90's dance pop in \\"Vogue\\".  While virtually every song is noteworthy, it is \\"Vogue\\" which continues to capture our imaginations and delivers as one of the greatest single moments in Madonna's career and probably popular music history.  This album teaches the listener that one should ever underestimate Madonna; while it seemed that this album would never make it out of the gate, it actually was another blockbuster with which Madonna continued to build her ever-changing image.    When \\"Dick Tracy\\" hit theatres Madonna indeed needed a successful film role very badly.  While her performance was not Oscar material, it was, however, formidable, and Madge was back on the big screen in a big way.  Madonna would go on to have many disastrous movie roles, but we can forgive her for that because the music is simply-stated \\"so good\\".  This album is definitely a gem, and it is absolutely essential for the Madonna fan.  This album does not reinvent the wheel, but it certainly carries itself with swagger and charm much like the era it represents.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|As of now, I've started my rewatch along with my parents (who are first time LOST viewers... I forced them to start watching and now they are hooked) and we're still only on season 1, but the picture quality is great. You will probably notice that a few issues pop up in the video quality, mostly just in the pilot, but that can be overlooked.<br /><br />The packaging is awesome. I love complete collections and I had waited to buy any seasons because I was waiting for this to come out... and it was worth the wait. The only drawback to these large collections is that its kind of a process to pull out the individual seasons, but oh well, its freakin' LOST. Its awesome!<br /><br />JUST BUY IT ALREADY
B001BPJJ82|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie. The synopsis on the back gave me confidence that this was a work of love for the director, and may not be commercial enough for a mainstream audience. These are usually my favorite movies.  Unfortunately this movie falls short of spectacular in all aspects.     The plot was bland, confusing and anti-climactic. I ended the film as I had started it, not caring at all about what I saw. It lost any sense of realism when the main characters would narrate over the story and change anything they wanted. I never found myself engrossed in the story at all, just seemed made up with no additional dimensions to support it (i.e. morals, lessons, development).    The acting was good, I enjoyed the little girl's acting, she is very cute. Besides the hospital scenes, the other actors/actresses were over acting and not convincing in their roles. The characters are just forgettable.    The cinematography was beautiful in many scenes but never for extended periods time. Being shot all around the world I expected many different locations, diverse scenery, stunning beauty. While it is beautiful in most scenes, I could not tell that it was shot in so many places around the world, scenery was generally barren and unremarkable. The camera's reference point seemed to me to be right in the middle, what I mean is most of the time the camera is not far enough away to capture surrounding magnificence. At the same time, not close enough to give detailed expressions. Which leaves the viewer somewhere in between, much like the plot.    The audio was also very flat, and never stood out. While there were never any real flaws, it also never captivated or mesmerized me in any way.  The picture quality on Blu-Ray was excellent, great colors, no flaws, light unnoticeable grain, nice detail.    Over all, I would recommend renting this video instead of a blind buy.

B003SPCYP8|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that directors feel they have to make and actors have to be a part of.  It didn't get a lot of hype in this country and to be fair, not so fond of the subtitles.  But if you were a fan of 'Forrest Gump', 'Schindler's List', or even 'The Pianist', this is the movie for you.  It is actually a triumph of the human spirit, and how simple life can be broken down. Good people do good deeds and bad people do bad deeds. This movie transcends religious boundaries and lets us all know how much our prejudice hurts other people.  I don't know much about the actors or the production company.  I just know that there were times I felt ashamed, times I felt sad, and times I just wanted to cheer.  Sit down with your kids, watch this movie, teach them something about how the world has changed.  Teach them how to make this world better...
B0000C6K09|2.0|This particular collection of John Williams music has some really cool cues in it.  For instance, it is really quite fun to hear a new recording and new interpretation of The Map Room/Dawn from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  The other really cool one that is one of my favorites is The Mine Car Chase from Temple of Doom.  The fact that these two rather obscure compositions from the movies are included indicates that whomever decided to record this had a great love and appreciation for John Williams' music.  I only wish included in this set were a few more \\"obscure\\" cues from some of his other movies.  What about the nice music in Superman that was NOT the main theme?  This is always omitted from a box set.    Unfortunately, the one cue I really hate is the long rendition from Close Encounters.  That is long, tedious and not well played by this orchestra.  It seems every John Williams compilation includes that.  Why couldn't it have included just a shorter cue or 2 from other parts of the movie?    Being the John Williams fan I am, I always chafe when music from Home Alone is not included in a John Williams box set, being that it is one of his more brilliant compositions.  Also, since Jaws 2 is out of print and Jaws 2 had some of the greatest music ever, I would have liked to have seen some of that music, as well.  What about the main theme from The Lost World, a brilliant but forgotten theme?  Far too much Star Wars but not enough of other things.  Although, I have to admit, they did include some of the slower, prettier Star Wars movie cues, which I do enjoy.    I have to agree with the other reviewers that this recording has some major problems.  The most serious one is the recording of the Jurassic Park themes.  The Jurassic Park track on this CD really sounds AWFUL.  I cannot quite tell why -- perhaps because they are out of tune?  It is really hard to tell.  There are other cues where the orchestra is below par as well, but it is so glaringly obvious in the Jurassic Park section that it is worth specially mentioning.    My other complaint is what is with all the vocal music from Empire of the Sun?  That cue goes on way too long and in fact, the orchestral parts in that movie were WAY BETTER than that endless boychoir song.  It is so long that it gets tedious for the listener.    It is also apparent that someone liked his Jane Eyre music more than some of his other stuff.  The proliferation on this recording of Jane Eyre music from that obscure TV movie kind of makes this set unbalanced.  Overall, not a bad compilation but it definitely has its problems.
B004Q8LDL2|4.0|This is one of those rare movies that actually lives up to the hype.  Sean Connery gives a fleshed out performance, and Nicholas Cage is a little flat at the beginning, but it works out in the end.  If you love action, love stories, and final last minute saves, this is your movie.  It comes and takes you and by the time it lets you go, you have felt breathless and tears at the same time.  Watch this movie!
B004U8VQOW|2.0|If you are looking for the many amazing images that Hubble has captured of the universe, this is not for you. I was hoping for gasp after gasp floating through space listening to scientific speculation about Hubble's findings. And you get about 10 minutes of that. The majority of the picture is about astronauts fixing a few bolts and panels in space.  I am sure there are those out there for whom that is fascinating. Please enjoy.  If you are looking for Hubble's magnificent images go to the NASA page or do a Google search. You will have more luck than in this video.

B0041KKYEW|1.0|I bought this Blu-ray DVD without ever having seen the movie. It was nominated for several Oscars, after all, and actually won best actress. And although I had heard it had some freaky supernatural/psychological stuff going on, I am a major \\"Swan Lake\\" fanatic, so I figured any movie whose plot revolves around a production of that incredible masterpiece had to at least be interesting. WRONG! I agree with just about every other one-star review. First up, the film is BORING. When I glanced at the timer on my Blu-ray player at one point and saw that I was already 40 minutes into it, I was amazed to realize that virtually nothing had happened. Natalie Portman's character is one-dimensional and thoroughly unpleasant, so it's hard to become invested in what she is going through. THIS is supposedly an Oscar-worthy performance? The mother, played by Barbara Hershey, is merely a rip-off of Piper Laurie from \\"Carrie,\\" which may or may not have been intentional. The film's main device seems to be to keep you guessing whether bizarre, supernatural events are actually occuring, or if we're just taking a brief tour through the mind of a psychotic. I realize that to today's post-literate world of teenage moviegoers, being confusing or obscure passes as art (\\"Memento\\" and \\"Inception\\" leap to mind), but it isn't. I've participated in conversations of people who have seen this film and were trying to reach a consensus as to what was actually happening in the film, but no one seems to be sure. More to the point, by the end of the film, you really don't care anymore. As for this film giving any insight whatsoever into Tchaikovsky's ballet masterpiece, forget it. The Black Swan and White Swan are always danced by the same dancer; it is not some unusual tour-de-force to do both roles. The Black Swan (whose name, never mentioned in the film, is Odile) is NOT the \\"evil twin\\" of the White Swan (Odette); she is the evil magician's daughter who has been enchanted to look exactly like Odette so as to confuse the prince and foil his love for the White Swan, the love that could have saved her. She is not supposed to burst onto the scene like a snarling nympho on crack; the trick in dancing the Black Swan is to come across ALMOST exactly like the White Swan but with just enough of a patina of evil to let the audience know she isn't the same person without being so obvious as to tip off the prince. But sutlety apparently has as much of a place in today's moviemaking as good writing and acting. Give the audience a few eye-popping visual effects, and to hell with the drama. However, this movie was educational in a different way: I have learned never to buy a DVD of a film I haven't already seen.
0385732554|3.0|Mr. A's 8th grade LA class liked this book's themes and symbolism; however, the perceived slow pace turned some of us off, and the ambiguous ending was not appreciated by all.

B004L3AQFG|5.0|Great movie, one of Danny Boyle's best films. The movie is inspiring and hard to believe that it actually happened. James Franco is great as Aron Ralston and during his time trapped, it's shot with a home camera similar to cloverfield.     The blu ray quality is great too. The special features are great too. You even see an interview with Aron himself and all the people involved in the rescue. This is a must have.
031261246X|5.0|This book is an easy read for anyone who has ever used a computer connected to the internet. The book is even more interesting and compelling if you have ever installed an anti-virus product on a PC. So, there you go; this book will be a good read for almost anyone who picks it up.    The plot is all to believable. A group is creating a storm of worms and viruses to invade the computer systems that control our banking, airlines, power generation - you know, every part of our life. This threat as been real and possible for quite a few years now. The recent publicity surrounding the stuxnet virus that targeted the Iranian nuclear programme has shown just how real this kind of scenario is.     Rootkits and zero day operating system vulnerabilities represent an open risk to the way our economy operates. Even though this book has been several years being created, the threat has been around for several years now. In fact the author, @markrussinovish has said that he was surprised at how quickly a scenario like stuxnet eventuated.    I was expecting this to be a thriller in the mould as Deamon by Daniel Suarez but it is quite different. Along the way Russinovich explains a lot of the internet and virus jargon that may be unfamiliar to some. Coupled with the fact that the chapters are short and crisp - sort of web page length I'd say, Zero Day is accessible to geeks and internet newbies alike.    A great, modern thriller - well worth a read.    I do so hope that this book helps the world wake up to mitigating the risks we face with so much of our economy online.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I've had these headphones for about a month now.  They've always connected flawlessly to any computer I plug the usb dongle into and the sound quality it great.  It's a little funky using the microphone because with a closed earphone design, you can't hear yourself unless you enable microphone feedback.  The problem with microphone feedback in this case is there is a significant delay (about 0.5 seconds) which gets annoying quickly.  That being said, with microphone feedback turned off I got used to speaking in a normal voice volume even though I couldn't hear myself easily.  I don't use the extra macro buttons too often, but having the volume roller control on the headphone is really nice.  I also love the overall quality of the headphone.  Lastly as I mentioned in the title, my ears get pretty hot after some hardcore gaming.  I wish I could poke some holes in the ear cups to get some air flow.

B003Y5H55G|3.0|There's a reason [[ASIN:B0019MFY3Q Spaced]] bombed when it was piloted for the American market. Pat characters and watered down English humor plus the crude [[ASIN:B000T28PGA Benny Hill]]-isms to disguise it's translation for American audiences (or at least, the pandering to a network to generate as much cross market appeal for American audiences. Whatever.)<br /><br />For another example, see: Paul. And if you've seen the trailers, you've seen the best bits.<br /><br />It's OK. There has obviously been a fair amount of love and dedication put into Paul. It has lots of in-jokes. Pegg and Frost are still great together. The overall plot is fine, too. The central character, Paul, is fun in an obnoxious way. An alien lifted from [[ASIN:B00005LKHW American Pie]]. There is fun in the rolling gag about an alien with three bits. And the three FBI agents share a lot of the comedy too, while Pegg and Frost play it straight as the geeky road-trippers. Paul does have a couple of genuinely funny laugh-out-loud moments and the scenes where Pegg and Frost get to indulge their geekdom are great.<br /><br />But it's a blunt and soft movie: characterless. Generic hillbillies, generic dumb cops, generic religious zealots (I still can't believe Pegg and Frost were involved in that clunker of a sub-plot), generic romance and a happy-ever-after ending. Too much of the movie is tempered by the an all too obvious script: the hamfisted recurring joke about gayness, the brutal inclusion of religion, the general freshman idiocy of Paul himself. All these photo-shopped scenes and caricatures should have had the zip and vim of the baddies from [[ASIN:B0009UC810 The Blues Brothers]], could have been as unique as the supporting cast from [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]] or [[ASIN:B000RJO578 Hot Fuzz]], had some of the runaway bride zaniness of [[ASIN:B002N57KG2 The Cannonball Run]] or at least the kind of fun of [[ASIN:B00005R874 Evolution]].

B004FRX0MY|4.0|Out of nowhere Amazon has a very compelling Android music player. Streaming works great and I didn't have any of the hiccups that I nearly always had with Rdio, MOG, Rhapsody, and Audiogalaxy, even on 3G. I think it even autobuffers the next song, which the above apps all failed to do, despite claiming it as a feature.<br /><br />There are a few features that would make it way cooler, though:<br /><br />1. Unify cloud music and device music. This could be replaced by a simple icon for one or the other, and would make it easier to see what you had on each, without flipping back and forth.<br />2. Be able to access your wishlist/shopping lists from the app. Buying music and having it available instantly in cloud player is awesome, but it's a pain to have to go to Amazon.com to pick up the albums that I've already saved in my lists.<br />3. Fix the uploader application for Windows. If you don't use iTunes or WMP, it has to crawl your hard drive and those results are organized by folder rather than tag, and on-drive folder structure is not preserved, which makes it excessively difficult to upload all albums by a given artist.

B001NLKT60|4.0|This book certainly had it's share of jaw-dropping moments (one about 200 pages in, and another 200 pages after that, of which I will not spoil).  The author did a great job in not trying to recreate the first book, but to create a completely different path for his characters.  The first book was trying to unravel a 30 year old mystery, and this one deals very much in the \\"here and now.\\"  The characters have picked up and advanced from the events of the first book, and not a bland recreation of themselves from the previous novel.  Furthermore, in this one, there are subtle setups to the 3rd book.<br /><br />My only detractors were that at times I feel as though the author was trying to pad the page count.  Lisbeth's encounter with a couple while on vacation didn't really do anything for the novel, per se.  It really only led to reminding us that she hates men who hates women.  This exposition could have been done in different ways.  With this changed, the first real reveal of the book wouldn't have happened 200 pages in, but maybe 150 pages in.  Or sooner!  Secondly, as the book unfolds, there seems to be a lot of summaries.  Blomkvist reading through his notes, or Salander remembering events, recreating notes found in the laptops, etc.  To what purpose, to remind the readers of what they are currently reading?  It seemed as tedious and a page-filler.<br /><br />Other than that, the book does have a faster pace than the first book, the progression of characters is strong and believable, and we get more of an insight into the life of Lisbeth Salander along the way - her background, why she is who she is, her motivations etc.  All told, very well done and a strong effort.
038073186X|5.0|Dennis Lehane's Shutter Island is a gothic mystery/suspense novel that takes place on an island near Boston. The story starts with Teddy Daniels and his partner on a boat nearing the island. They are detectives looking for a woman who has disappeared. There are numerous twists which kept me guessing and a cast of characters ranging from those in One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It's hard to say anything more about the plot without giving anything away, so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Dennis Lehane's writing ability is on another level from his peers. Despite the nature of the novel, he writes with eloquence and grace, creating vivid images and setting scenes that translate perfectly to the big screen. The pace of the novel is like a runaway train. It starts fast and only gets faster as Teddy Daniels gets closer to the strange truth behind Shutter Island.<br /><br />I put this on my book shelf as a definite reread. I'd recommend it to any lover of mystery or suspense who wants some real writing for a change instead of the hacks who fill up most mystery sections these days. I can't recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />Bookophile Rating: 98%

B004GHBQ7O|3.0|Before I begin, let me just say that I love Green Day, especially their live performances. I have been a fan since I was 13 and I'm now 30. That having been said I was incredibly excited when I heard about this set, much like I was a few years ago when I heard about \\"Bullet In A Bible\\". Then I saw the tracklisting...and that it was a single CD w/DVD(or Blu-Ray)...and the disappointment set in.<br /><br />First of all, if you order a hard copy, the CD is only 63 minutes long. Why? The average show on this tour was 2 1/2 hours but you're only giving me a one hour CD? If you purchase the iTunes version you get an extra three tracks (\\"Letterbomb\\", \\"Christie Road\\", and a medley of \\"Paper Lanterns/2000 LYA\\") which brings you to just about 78 minutes. Great. Unfortunately iTunes is not lossless, so you're not truly getting CD-quality sound. Which may not matter to some people but it does to me. The song selection for the CD/iTunes version is very good. I was thrilled to get great sounding versions of \\"Who Wrote Holden Caulfield\\", \\"J.A.R.\\" and \\"Going to Pasalacqua\\", etc. but do I really need another version of \\"W.M.U.W.S.E.\\" or \\"Good Riddance\\"? Not that these aren't great songs but they played \\"Armatage Shanks\\", \\"Stuck With Me\\", \\"80\\", \\"One For the Razorbacks\\", \\"The Judge's Daughter\\", etc. on this tour. Why aren't they on here??? Especially since the CD is only 60 minutes!!! In addition to the above complaints, there are some bizarre things that were cut-out of the songs...like the whole guitar intro/doodle/thing that Billie does into \\"Pasalacqua\\" is cut. Why? Before they played \\"Caulfield\\" at MSG, Billie sang a few lines from \\"Stuart and the Ave\\" but that's cut too. Again, why?<br /><br />Then there's the DVD/Blu-Ray...Now, unlike some of the other reviewers I like the artsier/grittier way it was shot, much like the \\"B.I.A.B.\\" DVD was...only thankfully without the interviews/clips cutting in between every song...and the Blu-Ray looks amazing on a high-def TV (I should caution you that the transfer is only 1080i and is not as crisp a look as you might be expecting, in fact if you are a fan of the SyFy \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" series, that's what it reminds me of).

I am very please to have purchased this book and I believe this book will be very beneficial for anyone who is just starting out.
B0042RUMJG|3.0|I just wanted to point out how utterly ridiculous it is that this is not available on standard DVD.  Many music lovers (myself included) would love to have this concert, but do not have a Blu Ray player nor plan to get one.  In fact, I would guess that only a very tiny percentage of potential viewers have Blu Ray.
0670022411|1.0|What a start to this novel -- a real page turner for the first third of the book.  That said, it quickly went downhill.  There were problems that would have been remedied with editing, editing, editing -- editing out about 200 pages.  I mean really, how many times did we have to read about Matthew running his long white fingers through his dark hair.  The storyline had so much potential but the author fizzled fast.  I hope the second book picks up the pace and brings the story back to life.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|This has everything: comedy, romance, bad guys, and cynical heroes all wrapped up with the wittiest dialogue and rapid-fire delivery ever written for screen by by Hollywood's best writers. It has wonderful A-list casting with Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman and the underestimated Humphrey Bogart in his first romantic role. Treat yourself and see this one. One cannot imagine a more perfect movie.     See: [...] for more information.
B00102F5WK|5.0|Other reviewers feel that the movie is \\"superficial\\". The same comments can be made for the \\"Hurt Locker\\".  I find that \\"Rendition\\" is understated, it reminds one of the spare prose of Hemingway,and it is comparable to any film about  decent people going though their day nonchalantly while Jews or whoever around them were exterminated---Think of \\"The Pianist\\".  It is this \\"normalness\\" of an abomination our government practices that should make us afraid of what we are. We should be afraid for ourselves. See it and weep. See it and be afraid that it may happen to you. You do travel, don't you?
B003R0MF5S|5.0|This is a bit premature since we are still in the middle of season 4, but we record each episode and watch it multiple times.  Chuck is one of the few shows that the entire family must watch together, and we have a strange demographic in that there are 3 girls and one guy (me) in our viewing family.  I thought Chuck might be a little too \\"boy-oriented\\" with the beautiful Yvonne Strahovski and Sarah Lancaster, but the ladies in the family love the entire cast and absolutely swoon over Zachary Levi, Adam Baldwin and Ryan McPartlin.  The episodes might stretch reality a bit, but are great fun.  One reviewer said that Chuck did not fit into a contemporary television genre while I would suggest that Chuck might be described as a cross between Charlie's Angels (which is spoofed in a Season 4 episode) and Get Smart.  With the stunning cast members, HD and Blu Ray are the best ways to enjoy Chuck.
B003SM1Z10|3.0|This DVD would be SOOOOOOO awesome if the didn't forget to mic up Hennamen's guitar.   WTF, dual soloing guitarists of the HIGHEST caliber and they overlook mic one of them!!!   If you can get past that, then this is a DVD for all true Slayer fans to own!!!!
0439023513|4.0|Spoilers!    I've said it before, sequels never do the original justice, no matter how good they are, and Mockingjay is no exception. A lot happens in this book. There is a lot of action, a lot of detail and a lot of characters. In the first two books, Collins does a great job of describing exactly what is going on during each of the Hunger Games. Her \\"war\\" is always very descriptive. I have vivid images of each of the hunger games arenas, and each of the characters from the first two books. In this book, the writing falls a bit flat. There are large parts of the action scenes where I didnt quite understand what was happening. Several times I had to go back and re-read. A few of the characters were never fully developed, and Collins just killed them off anyway, so I guess it didnt matter.    I was very upset with Finnick's death. It happened in 2 seconds and no one seemed to care. For such a major character, his fight for death should have been given more attention. Even after his death, Katniss and the others dont seem affected by it. This wasnt the death of someone in the arena. This was a character who they had all known and spent time with, and presumably, cared about. He was just killed off and forgotten about as if he was a minor character.    Prim's death was also not handled well. At first, I didnt even know that she died! A little more description and attention to the events here would have been nice.    Beyond that, I loved the book. I loved the twist with Peeta's highjacking, and the \\"real or not real\\" game. I loved how Haymitch really shone as a mentor. I loved that Collins made Katniss so real - she struggled in this book with life and death and killings and the aftermath of everything that happened to her, her family, and her country. I was afraid she was going to become a robot, but Collins gave her heartache and grief, and that, for me, really completed her character.    Despite the flaws, I cheered for Panam, cried for Prim, and prayed that Peeta would figure things out. I loved this trilogy, really enjoyed this final installment and finished it extremely satisfied. I hope the movie does this trilogy justice!!

B001ILHY1I|5.0|We had watched Death Race Two and decided that we just had to see the first Death Race video. After searching for a few weeks we decided to go here to amazon.com to locate and purchase this DVD. We recieved it within a timely manner and in excellent condition. The movie was just what we expected awesome. We will be purchasing many more videos through here.
B00066N8JS|5.0|In 1994 nine inch nails released 'The Downward Spiral' and it would become the album that everything else nine inch nails did would be compared to. The album was an instant classic taking the listener on a bleak journey further and further into an existence that nobody would want to go through. From opening track 'mr self destruct' to album closer 'hurt' nine inch nails maestro Trent Reznor paints a bleak picture but that's the only thing that was bleak about the album that would catapult nine inch nails into a headline act and go on to sell 5 million copies of the album.     Eleven years later and the music world is a different place so it was probably the perfect time for a deluxe reissue of the downward spiral, and what a reissue it is, presented in SACD 5.1 sound as well as high resolution stereo and coming with a bonus cd of b sides and remixes this is one album that even if its in your collection you have to buy again. Trent Reznor never was a fan of lo-fi and always believes that every recording should be of the highest standard and that definitely applies to this reissue, especially if you have a SACD player (sony and philips specialise in these, so if you have a ps3(OLDER MODELS ONLY) its included) and a decent amp and speakers you will be able to experience the full joy of this album. You will end up hearing sounds that you didn't hear in the original album and will be surrounded by the music.     Even if you don't have a SACD player you will notice the improved quality over the 1994 recording as everything is clean and crisp. The bonus cd is a welcome addition as it includes some songs that were only released on movie soundtracks such as the joy division cover Dead Souls (the crow movie) and Burn (natural born killers) as well as loads of b-sides from the albums singles as well as a couple of demo versions.     When you listen to the quality you will be hoping Reznor gives the rest of his albums this treatment.
B000EB73NC|5.0|This thing comes with the speed sensor from polar.  It's a great mount and can attach almost anywhere on a bike.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Similar to SPEED but not quite as good.  Tale focuses on a train that gets out of control and starts to pick up speed, creating danger for the community.  Washington and Pine do good to very good jobs with their characters but some of the supporting cast members are more memorable.  There's some good heart pumping action moments in this film.  Overall, I thought this would be a great film when it was only good.  It's hard to describe other than I didn't feel every scene overlapped properly, but, since this isn't film school I won't go into the details.  Overall, a good movie and better than most but not \\"A\\" quality.  I found the last few minutes to be cheesy. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; ACTION SCENES: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of March 2011; MY GRADE: B.
B00005JLT5|5.0|WHAT A MOVING STORY!  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE HOLOCAUST AND LOVE MUSIC, YOU WILL CHERISH THIS MOTION PICTURE.  ADRIEN BRODY IS MAGNIFICENT!  THE LAST SCENE WILL BLOW YOU AWAY IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH CHOPIN'S UNFORGETTABLE MUSIC . . . .
B004T0XYM8|5.0|We all LOVE the EASTWOOD SPAGHETTI WESTERNS- Leone at his VERY BEST... BUT here we are presented with, in my opinion, one of the Greatest EVER to be commited to celuloid film!  The musical score will HAUNT AND TEASE you, the scenery shots are to DIE FOR, and the acting from the 3 main characters brings out THE VERY BEST of EACH of them.  Who would ever have previouslt thought HENRY FONDA could play the Big Bad Guy, instead of the usual lovable hero we all loved?  Here he plays the Anti-Hero with such CONVICTION, ABILITY and in a new-found role that challenges him to the limit and brings out a performance most would never have believed possible- and he pulls it off like he was LIVING that role!  CHARLES BRONSON of course is adept at such roles, but here we SEE a softer side too.   CLAUDIA CARDINALE is outstanding in her role, adding softness with hardness too.  MANY will criticize this movie for its long run time, and apparently SLOW PACE.... I DISAGREE!... IT ALL ADDS to the chilling story...leading thru to the GRAND FINALE which MUST RANK as one of the LONGEST CLIFFHANGERS in History, KEEPING you at the EDGE of your seat GRIPPED WITH ANTICIPATION... as LEONE SKILLFULLY elongates, and EEKS OUT EVERY DROP OF EMOTION FROM YOU...and STILL FINDS TIME to KEEP IT Rolling, with a musical track here you WILL REMEMBER FOR ALL YOUR DAYS!!!  THE REAL HERO, of course, is the MASTERFUL, SKILFULL AND LEGEND SERGIO LEONE, who has left us with this FINE LEGACY - THE VERY EPITOME of The SPAGHETTI WESTERN GENRE... even if a little off genre.  AT LAST  the folks at PARAMOUNT have seen fit to give THIS GEM the Blu_ray HI-DEF TREATMENT it so RICHLY DESERVES... One of the ALL TIME Greatest Movies of any kind.  I STRONGLY RECCOMEND YOU SEE THIS MOVIE!!   YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN SEE ANOTHER QUITE LIKE IT!! NOR WILL ONE EVER BE MADE THAT WILL SURPASS IT.  AN ESSENTIAL for ANY SERIOUS FINE MOVIE COLLECTOR!
B003O3EKHE|5.0|A GREAT MOTION PICTURE NOT TO BE MISSED!  BILLY ELLIOTT GIVES US A RARE OPPORTUNITY OF RECOGNIZING TALENT AT A VERY EARLY AGE.  IT TEACHES US NOT TO IGNORE THIS GOD-GIVEN TALENT, BUT TO NURTURE IT TO ITS FULLEST.  A TRULY REMARKABLE STORY !!!

B002ZG976U|4.0|I loved this and personally don't see why it was given so much negative press. It's not perfect, but as far as stories like this go, I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a big fan of Christina, I thought for her first film her acting wasn't bad at all. Let's be honest here, it could have been worse. I've seen actresses who make their living acting do a terrible job.  I love Cam (won't even attempt to spell his last name :)) and I do wish the love story between the two had been a bit stronger . . . Cher was wonderful and witty, as always. I'm a huge fan of Kristen Bell too, and I thought she was a very convincing as the bitchy jealous type. Just finished downloading the soundtrack, it's wonderful too. :)
B004G6009U|5.0|I'll keep myself short. I watched the movie in the movie theater with my husband and daughter (3 years old). We all loved it and laughed at it. This movie is so kind and gives you truly good mood. I am still under impression of it. And we certainly watch it over and over again. I didn't like all Disney movie. But this one is one of their best. The jokes are so good and never corny.
B004TP6O8O|1.0|The world is obviously playing a trick on me.    How is this well-reviewed? If I could, I would give this CD -12 stars and it wouldn't even be low enough.    As a disclaimer, I am NOT old. I'm a 19 year old college student. I am NOT a rap hater. I listen to a lot of rap and do respect it as an art. I am NOT a conservative freak who hates everything. I am a very rational and very moderate in my views.    But I do feel that as time goes on, things get worse and worse in the world and this is the epitome of my fears. This is awful music. It has no real purpose other than to push marijuana use. I could honestly only listen to about a minute of each track before I could not stand to listen anymore. Wiz Khalifa is the biggest joke around. He is not real. He is not cool. He is a con artist. He pushes drug use and really damaging behavior into the ears of people and I, frankly, find it disturbing. And that is not said lightly. I do not usually find myself being as disgusted as I am that this was not only recorded, but produced by someone (supposedly) sane.    I guess this is why the music industry is struggling. If the industry is grasping so much as to give this miserable excuse some money, spend the money to produce it and sell it, then there is no excuse why the music industry makes absolutely no money anymore.     But while the VAST majority of this album is intolerable and vomit-inducing, there are some tracks that can be listened to without a gag-reflex.    Black and Yellow is a very catchy tune. I totally understand why this song is popular. And probably that it is the sole reason any of these CDs are being sold. As far as a first song goes, it's not bad. It has all the elements in it. Money, girls. Those are hat declares a new rap artist. While there have been notable exceptions, this is the general formula.    Roll Up is not a bad tune as well. It will certainly go on to be one of the most recognizable of his songs. It's about a girl. And it's not too bad.    Everything on the rest of the CD is absolute garbage. And you can bet your bottom dollar I would use a stronger word to describe it if I was able to.    Wiz Khalifa is in the same place I believe Drake is in. The fad place. They will disappear in a year or two like many have before them. They are like 50 Cent and the rest of G-Unit (possibly excluding Lloyd Banks), Twista, Fat Joe, and Ja Rule. Wiz Khalifa has none of the makings of rap history like Eminem, Lil Wayne, Busta Rhymes, 2Pac and Biggie. It's sad to watch such worthless artists rise to even get 15 minutes of fame.    If you are even considering spending money on this, DON'T. Get something from the legends above. Or if you want something new, get Lasers by Lupe Fiasco. It's a thousand times better.
B00377V6J2|5.0|This is a great re-release to include the DVD.  The master and student.  Really great video w/ intimate conversation.  The music of course is some of the finest blues ever to be played.  You'll want to hear it again and again.

1593072937|5.0|If you like the movie that this book is a must! It is the Marv Goldie part of the story. It is almost word for word the movie but has added material. Marv really kicks ass. I think it is even better than the movie because of Frank Millers beautiful drawings. The movie was great but the book is even louder, bolder, and bad ass!!! I was on a adrenaline high the entire time reading it! I couldn't put it down till I was finished. I am not a  big reader but the almost 200 pages just flew by as I was soaked into the story.   The only bad thing is since it is the third printing it has a white cover and doesn't match the second edition books 3-6 that I bought which have a black cover. When put together the second edition books make an illustration of Nancy with her lasso. Luckily Book 2 which also has a white cover had the Nancy illustration in it so at least I got o see it. Books are made to read and not just look good on the shelf. I think any fan of the movie should buy at least this first book if not all of them!

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I've got a couple days under my belt with the cloud / player and my initial impression is favorable. It's not perfect but the basic functionality is there and the delivery of music to my phone so far has been solid. I've had no troubles streaming and fowarding the stream via bluetooth works as well.    Mpls. / St. Paul market  Southern metro  HTC Incredible on Verizon 3g    The Good:  - Solid performance. No gaps in streaming either during or between songs.  - Clean interface. Easy to navigate.  - Stream can be forwarded via bluetooth (A2DP)    The Bad:  - Spendy - I'm hoping that the price get's driven down as adoption with cloud computing takes off. It's true you get the first year free but that's just the hook. After that you're looking at a buck a gig per year basically, or $20 per year. The pricing is also tiered so that you can't just add 5 gigs as you need them, it jumps from 20 to 50 to 100 to 500 and finally 1000 gigs, or a Terabyte. I would very much like to see this model disappear and be replaced with an 'on demand' model where I'm not forced into paying for storage I'm not using.  - Auto resume - Currently when a txt message or call comes in the player pauses but does not resume once the txt / call is complete. (Updated 7/12/11 - This has been fixed)  - External controls - Currently there is no external controls when the phone is locked. I have to unlock the phone and page over to the app to control the player.    I will update as I gain more experience with this platform but I think this is a solid beginning.

B0047Y17P2|1.0|I have read all of the Connelly books as they came out, but  . . . I will wait until this one drops off the best seller lists.  As a previous commenter wrote, isn't book price a big reason for buying the Kindle?
B00466HM28|5.0|For the price this thing is awesome.  Lots of control, works great.  I bought it to use with Logic on my laptop while traveling as a little portable studio, and it is absolutely amazing for that function.  The keys are obviously tiny (the whole unit is really small), but it's playable, very functional, and great as an extremely portable midi controller.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|When this series started I was hooked, then Georgie started slacking. The four volumes presented here leave at least three more volumes before the saga will be completed and since he promised that volume five would be released imminently (five years ago) I have lost interest in the series (the fourth volume was, according to him, only half of a book, and it reads like it).    In addition, the price for the kindle version, at double the price for the paper copies,is insane.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I'm not sure what I could possibly say about Firefly that hasn't been said a thousand times before.  I completely missed it during its first run on Fox.  In fact, my first exposure to Firefly was when a friend encouraged me to see Serenity at a movie theater.  Since then, I've watched the series several times.    As a word of warning to other conscientious parents, the show can be fun and lighthearted, but ultimately this is NOT a show for kids.  There's plenty of sex, violence, torture and other adult themes.  (This hit me when my daughter asked me, \\"What's a Companion?\\")  Firefly is best watched after the kids are in bed.
0316069353|1.0|Don't get the logic of the pricing, but do want to send a message -- won't buy either type (and I really like Connelly, so it is a disappointment ... but truly don't need the book that bad.)
B000UJCALI|5.0|As with all movies based on novels by Stephen King, they are very suspenseful and keep you on the edge of your seat. Jack Nicholson is the best at playing his part in the movie. I couldn't think of a better actor for the part. Even though the movie is 31 years old, there is no way that the new version could compare other than graphics. This movie is by far the best movie to be made that was based on a novel.
0316069353|1.0|We have just found Michael Connelly's books and as new owners of the Kindle we were happy to add him to our \\" e-library.\\"  The main reason we bought the Kindle was  to purchase books at a reasonable price.  Now that the Kindle has caught on it seems that the prices are going up every month.  I agree with the second reviewer that it is just greed and not necessity that the prices are coming in so high.  To rate the book a one star because of the price may not be a fair way but it is a way to get the attention of the author and the publisher.  We will also wait for the paperback to come out.  Too bad as we are eager to read this book.

B000063DFQ|5.0|An album which is both revered and looked upon fondly by long-time fans (myself included), 1983's PIECE OF MIND found U.K. heavyweights IRON MAIDEN at the very cusp of international superstardom. Years of groundwork and three studio LP's (including 1982's genre-defining THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST), had set the stage for the Maiden Metal Machine to rampage their way to the leading-edge of the metal-tsunami which was consuming the music landscape of the era.      In early Jaunary of '83, MAIDEN descended upon the Bahamas and quickly ensconced themsleves into Nassau's Compass Point Studios with producer Martin Birch to begin the writing, rehearsal and tracking sessions for an album which would become a masterpiece of early-eighties metal: PIECE OF MIND.     The thundering barrage of drums which ignite LP-opener \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" make it abundantly apparent that MAIDEN '83 is brimming with worldly-confidence and newfound swagger. A devastating set-piece, \\"Dare\\" finds MAIDEN in battle-mode; guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray introduce a wicked machine-gun-like riff which quickly establishes the absolute EPICNESSS of the track. Their playing is flawless here and features some devilish Thin Lizzy-inspired twin-lead guitar. The pummeling rhythm section of bassist Steve Harris and kit-basher Nicko McBrain (taking over for the departing Clive Burr) threaten to plow over anything that might foolishly stray into their line of fire whilst Bruce \\"Air-Raid Siren\\" Dickinson belts it out for all it's worth with lyrical tales of the \\"snow outside\\" and \\"engines roaring in the night.\\" Mammoth and heroic, \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" is an absolute barnstormer of an opener.     \\"Revelations\\" ascends next from menacing seas and paints a morose scene of impending doom. Bruce is able to flex his vocal abilities here as he effortlessly  moves from gentle, swaying melodies to urgent and foreboding stylings with equal aplomb. Anchored by an oppressive, ominous riff, \\"Revelations\\" is a veritable tour-de-force of hypnotic guitars, spirlaling solos, stellar musicianship and is a major accomplishment on an album overflowing with brilliance.       Released as a single preceding the album, \\"Flight of Icarus\\" continues the themes set-forth by the preceding tracks and furthers the influence that both literature and film had assumed in affecting the motifs and ideas that founding-member and main-songwriter Steve Harris had adapted when writing. \\"Icarus\\" is Maiden's loose-spin on the ancient Greek myth of Icarus; whom was imprisoned inside of a labyrinth and planned an escape using fabricated wings. \\"Icarus\\" is an inspired choice as a lead-off single and features some fiery soloing from Smith and Murray.     Where \\"Icarus\\" was steady and methodical, \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" draws a line in the sand with authority and proceeds to EVISCERATE all that has come before with an absolute MONSTER of a riff. An innovative arrangement, provocative end-of-days storytelling and some spellbinding lead-work make \\"Boots\\" a hidden gem and one that deserves to be dusted-off and inserted into the band's current set-list.     Which brings us to what is perhaps one of MAIDEN'S most well-known and beloved songs EVER: \\"The Trooper.\\" Based upon the Battle of Balaclava in 1854 and partially upon a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson entitled \\"The Charge of The Light Brigade,\\" \\"The Trooper\\" has attained it's iconic status due to the song's unmistakable harmonized leads, galloping rhythms and Bruce's soaring vocals which depict the battle as seen through the eyes of an already deceased soldier. An undeniable classic, \\"The Trooper\\" explodes with absolute command of it's destiny  and ends triumphantly amidst a burning pile of embers atop a metallic battlefield.      \\"Still Life\\" (an enigmatic rocker), \\"Quest For Fire\\" and the melodic \\"Sun and Steel\\" are all fine efforts and contribute greatly to the record's legacy. Album-closer \\"To Tame A Land\\" is a portent of the ambitious, mega-sized MAIDEN compositions that would become a staple of their future repertoire. Chugging riffs and middle-eastern-tinged licks highlight this tale which was originally to be called \\"Dune\\" after the classic sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert. \\"Land\\" is vintage MAIDEN and fades into the sunset on the back of a mysterious coda.        Expertly sequenced and possessed of a bright production with guitars and drums high in the mix, PIECE OF MIND was a blueprint for the heavy metal foundation on which IRON MAIDEN were forging their musical edifice. Even though their crazed mascot Eddie was depicted confined to a padded cell on the cover, he was destined to escape and assist in helping the band to achieve a creative zenith with their next album and to attain new heights in popularity that not even they could have possibly imagined. - Ronnie Jimenez

B002VECMAE|5.0|My favorite 'war' movie of all time was 'DAS BOOT'.   Then comes Full Metal Jacket, then Apocalypse Now. All Five Star movies, and for me, this one is a top five-er   The very first line,'something about being more true than you would believe' is true.  This is a strange little movie, about some really strange stuff that will never be known about.  The Bill's and  the Lynns did exist though.   T  This is not really a war movie,  and probably should just get four stars, . because it is a bit disjointed, but, and probably just for me,  that is what is so good about it.  No one will ever put all the pieces together of  what went on then.   But I loved it.  And, so, for that very  reason,  I got to give it a  5 stars rating.  I was on Diego Garcia and in Guam in the  mid- 70's. Need I say more.    I have been a 'hermit', living on a farm,  and have owned at least one goat, most of the times,  many more, for 30 years.  I  will always love 'staring' at goats.
B001GZT57W|2.0|not much of a review , but more of a warning !!  This is actually the Grey/Silver mask Edition and not the Red & Gold as shown in the picture !!  I have tried to get the seller to confirm they have a \\"Red & Gold\\" 1 for me , but no reply yet!!     Apart from that the movie is awsome :D

0793518326|5.0|Great collection of accurate transcriptions for every Beatle song ever recorded. Expensive but very Deluxe format. Hardcover book in a hard slip-cover. The only problem is the very small printing makes it hard to read. However, there is no way to get around the small font as it is already over 1100 pages.
B004L49K20|5.0|I have been a big DD fan, coming from Germany to the USA however I lost track of what they were doing. I bought Red carpet massacer but I sold it real quick. What might work here in the USA when Timberlake and Timbaland come together, does not necessarly work with british pop or whatever is great in Europe. I have not bought this CD yet, I only listened to samples but what great samples they are. I thought I heard some of the old songs right in the new songs. New but with a trace of the good stuff. It is for people like me that are not new to DD but I feel it could appeal to new DD fans as well. It got everything, fast songs, slow ones and none are overhyped with all that what I call American stuff. The lyrics will always only make sense in Simon's head or whoever else has been with the band. But that is the fun of it too, trying to figure out what the lyrics could possible be referring to. I will gladly buy this CD and dream of things that used to be without losing me being cool, hip or whatever. Thanks for the mature DD to come out and play.
0307477479|4.0|i enjoyed this book. It tells a story from alternating POVs, spanning maybe 40 years.      There were definitely times when I wanted more of the story filled in, or would have liked to return to certain characters.  As a reader though, I was able to fill in the blanks.      Very Original.
0553582038|3.0|This was, by far, the least entertaining of the four novels.  I had a really hard time getting through this book.  BUT...I trust Mr. Martin.  He's a great author.  It may be that to have the epic finish he envisions for this wonderful series, he needed to slow down a bit.  I'll read the rest hoping he's just been structuring a stronger ending to the series than he originally intended.

0316078913|3.0|Another collection of essays from humorist David Sedaris, Holidays on Ice is not his best work. The stories, all dealing with the holiday season, are hit or miss, making for a very uneven book.    Far and away, the funniest, most irreverent essay included here is \\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" wherein Sedaris recounts his days working as a Macy's elf -- at the age of 33. This story alone makes Holidays readable, but if you're looking to begin reading David Sedaris, pass on this book and pick up Me Talk Pretty One Day instead.
B004P5ONZO|5.0|Awesome, the book got here in perfect condition and it arrived super quick, about three days faster than the estimate!   So awesome, im thrilled, great work, thanks!    Peace
0393338827|5.0|Amazon recommended this book to me today in one of their increasingly incessant emails. I still like them because they are such a good store. But, I haven't quite figured out if I have reviewed this before and they are still trying to sell the same book or I forgot to review this fine work.    So, I like Michael Lewis and have read the book and most everything he has written, but I have not found a way to check if I have reviewed a book before without paging through pages of reviews (6 in my case).     The Big Short describes in great detail and with winning prose in a field Mr. Lewis has great perspective on. Keep writing Michael. I will keep reading.     Anyway, based on computer systems, I thought I would see if their system is as smart as it is on my wish list management which flags duplicates.     If anyone else can tell me how to write duplicative reviews other than this, I would appreciate it.    Dear Amazon, I will like a complete list of the books I have reviewed that is easily viewed on a page. And, I will be there is a way and I just can't figure it out or you likely should provide one as a courtesy to your valuable customers as I can't be the only one.     By the way, I am putting LM+ in this review to see if I could search for that and find it that way in the future if I have to.
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|All of Mahler (or close enough), and a pdf of the German lyrics translated into English & French.  Excellent performances from EMI's vast catalog, and outstanding recordings.  Mahler wrote music from very soft to very loud (pppp to ffff), so that's the reason for the variation in volume levels in his music, not recording or engineering errors.  This is a great set.  Thank you EMI.
B00466HN6I|5.0|Source Code is a suspenseful, surprisingly intelligent, occasionally touching, movie that's far better than I'd expected it to be. With tight pacing, great editing, good acting and fine directing by Duncan Jones, best known for Moon, it's a very good sci-fi action film released outside the usual summertime area for such movies.    The film tells the tale of a man (Jake Gyllenhall), who wakes up on a train. He has no idea why he's there or who the woman across from him is. As he's trying to get things sorted out, an explosion goes off, killing everyone. He then comes to inside a capsule where it's explained to him that the train was blown up in a terrorist bombing. The terrorist was kind enough to do a practice run and apparently plans to detonate a dirty bomb in Chicago. Due to some sort of \\"quantum\\" effect he can \\"leap\\" into the body of a man who died on the train and live out his last eight minutes of life. Doing that will, with luck, enable him to find the bomber.    If it's a premise that sounds familiar, that's because it is. It's perhaps no surprise that Scott Bakula's voice turns up in a cameo during the movie, since it clearly owes a lot to his most famous work. In fact, it's basically Quantum Leap mashed-up with Groundhog Day while managing to be better than the first and at least as engaging as the second.    There was really nothing I disliked about this film. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best film I've seen so far this year, and, sadly, will likely be the best science fiction film for quite some time.

0316056863|5.0|I enjoy a good memoir.  It seems there's always something good to learn from other people's life experiences.  And while I'm not a huge Tina Fey fan, I enjoyed her as Sarah Palin on SNL and occasionally watch 30 Rock.  So after reading a review of the book, and being without anything to read at the moment, I took a chance and bought Bossypants, and I'm glad I did.    It seemed a little uneven starting out, but quickly transitioned into some very interesting pieces about her early jobs, her work with Second City, and then her transition into writing for SNL and her eventual creation of 30 Rock.  Interspersed are stories about growing up and dating, her eventual marriage, and her struggles to balance work and family life, as well as some candid advice for other women on how to make it in a male-dominated industry.    Perhaps what I liked most about the book is that even though there is a lot of self-deprecating (and distancing) humor, my sense in the end was that Fey gave us an honest look at who she is: imperfect, stumbling, but always rising again, persevering, and continuing to do what she loves.  I would say the book is well worth reading for any fan of Tina Fey, 30 Rock, or SNL, as well as for any woman who struggles to balance the roles of worker, spouse and mom.  It was a good read!
B004G600A4|4.0|My kids and I (ages 6 and 11) saw this in the movie theater and subsequently purchased the movie. It was enjoyable in the theater and they couldn't wait for the movie to be released on DVD. After watching it at least 5 times at home, it holds up well for replay value. What I mean is that some movies get to be very difficult to hear over and over but Tangled is fun.<br /><br />The princess is sweet, naive, and pleasant, her 'mother' is obnoxious and Flynn Ryder becomes very lovable. We really love the horse and his 'bloodhound' style. My kids especially like when the horse is hiding behind the bushes in the shape of a horse. The musical numbers are funny, very classic Disney. The animation is very well done.<br /><br />I've only given this four stars because if I compare it to recent releases like [[ASIN:B003XKPPOU Toy Story 3]] and [[ASIN:B002ZG97EC Despicable Me]], it is just not quite on the same level, close though. So I would go 4½ if I could.
159420229X|4.0|This book is well-written and researched -- indeed, it's one of the most outstanding examples of participatory journalism I've come across. Its chief value for me is that it contains lively and well-informed discussions of memory techniques which have been lost to our culture through the ages; however,the chapter \\"How to Memorize a Poem\\" -- the main reason I bought this book, and ditto for songs, my rote memory being frustratingly porous for these things -- did not live up to its billing. It's hard to imagine applying \\"Memory Palace\\" techniques to material that already contains its own \\"mental landscape\\": wouldn't they interfere with each other? What do you associate with each room, a word or a phrase or a stanza? He ends that chapter with the strange and discouraging assertion that poetry is among the more difficult things to remember using these techniques -- and yet, wasn't that one of the main purposes of memory techniques in times past? This book did make me interested in other writings that might elucidate the process of memorizing verbal material better. One I'd recommend is \\"By Heart -- 101 poems to remember\\" edited with an introduction by Ted Hughes. That short introduction does far more to clarify poetry memorization through visualization techniques than this book. I perhaps wouldn't have found value in that book, though, had my curiosity not been piqued by this one. It's been on my bookshelves for years; only now may I make use of it.
B003BLPTB0|3.0|The tops of mine I just ordered are too loose across the top of the mid foot. Crocs has gone on the cheap again, and these have very little arch support cushioning. All the newer designs of Crocs seem to have 'scrimped' on the 'crosilite'-plastic , and it feels like there is almost be a HOLE where a higher arch support in the foot bed should be. What did Crocs corporation save by eliminating that small additional volume of plastic needed to make an arch support in the bottoms of their shoes? I'm just about to give up on Crocs. They're sure not what they used to be. Crocs is becoming just a worthless plastic shoe like the comedians always joke about. Without arch supports in their newer styles, they're indeed a worthless joke and stupid to wear.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Thank you, to all the outstanding people who created this documentary and thank you to the brave souls who spoke the truth.  Since watching it, I awake each morning, wishing I was that little freshly hatched chick to find myself in the warm hand of the Latino women and be cerebially killed. Born innocent, happy, ready for life, knocked out before this system can touch.
B004GYY714|1.0|A great product as everyone says, but when TuneIn Radio is running, if a call comes in the phone will not ring or vibrate and the call goes to voice mail. I haven't figured out a solution and have emailed TuneIn as well. Using an Android HTC Hero phone from Sprint.
0312430000|4.0|I have enjoyed the previous books written by Atul Gawande , and this one was no exception. Gawande  has taken a potentially dull subject (checklists!) and turned it into an absorbing read. The focus is on the importance of developing checklists in the medical profession, but it builds on this idea from the use of checklists by other professions such as airline pilots and builders. The one part of the book that I was not sure about was Gawande's  description of the accident involving a Boeing 777  at Heathrow in 2008.  In his description Gawande does not mention the role the plane's captain, Peter Burkill,  played  in making a set of decisions that probably resulted in no loss of life as a result of the accident. True, the purpose of this example was not to explore the detail of the actual event, but to show how the subsequent investigation led to the development of a (check listed) procedure to manage the problem potential engine failure due to ice in the fuel in a 777. But nevertheless, I think a more accurate description of events on the flight deck would have been appropriate. In fact in one interview Peter Burkill comments on how he used a very simple checklist (Plane Path People) to help him decide on a course of action in the 30 or so seconds he had to deal with the situation ([...]). This would seem to have been very relevant to the book.
B004GYY714|4.0|The app provides a lot of non-english options too. I was pretty surprised with the collections and quality of Hindi stations available. Old/new classical and more importantly most of them are of good quality streaming. Been searching for such a app for a long time..
B0047Y17P2|1.0|Looks like the end of a long and beautiful friendship.  Not sure if the current kindel pricing is set by the author or the publisher, but way out of line.  Dropping from must read to wait for the used or out of date copy...
B003Y5H50G|5.0|Limitless is a great idea for a movie.  The idea of acquiring fantastic mental powers by simply taking a pill is probably appealing to most of us. The urge to be a genius instead of limited selves is a nice fantasy.  This is exactly where Eddie Mora (Bradley Cooper) finds himself.  Eddie begins the film as a perennial looser. He has an advance to write a book but can't find a way to begin or even articulate what the book is about.  Enter Eddie's sleazy former brother-in-law Vernon (Johnny Whitworth) who has a pill that allows people to access 100% of their brain.<br /><br />(Some Spoiler Below)<br />One doze of the drug (randomly named NZT-48 and definitely not FDA approved) allows Eddie to begin writing a fantastic book and is able to recall things long buried in his memory.  Eddie wants more of the drug and shows up at Vernon's apartment first a little beaten up then very dead and his apartment turned upside down.  Clearly, someone was looking for the NZT - but did they find it?  Eddie starts looking and just as he is about to give up, he discovers a bag filled with pills, money and a notebook with the names of clients.  With the drug, Eddie turns his life around.  He completes his book, becomes a successful investor and the love of his girlfriend Lindsey.  He is noticed by Carl van Loon (nicely played by Robert De Nero) who is a Warren Buffett-like mover and shaker.<br /><br />The story becomes cautionary. Eddie takes more of the NZT than he should and soon begins to experience period when the Hyde part of his personality takes over. He can't remember where he has been or what he has done.  He meets his once brilliant ex-wife who burned out taking the drug and we find out the taking it can lead to severe illness and death. So, who else is on NZT?<br />(End Spoilers)<br /><br />Barry Cooper plays Eddie as a likeable average guy who has nothing but problems.  The drug eliminates his obstacles and he becomes dangerously overconfident as he learns Italian in minutesto impress a woman and understands complex financial data but simply looking at it. Limitless has a lot of suspense as Eddie's life becomes more complicated and he is threatened by someone who clearly knows he has the drug and then by a Russian loan shark named Gennady. Robert De Nero is his professional best in the supporting part of Carl Van Loon, who is impressed with Eddie but also has some reservations.  Abbie Cornish is good as Eddie's girlfriend and Andrew Howard makes an effective villain as Gennady.  The CG work that fills in Eddie's experience when he looses control of the drug pulls and twists what he sees effectively. Anyone who gets motion sickness easily will want to look away.<br /><br />Some reviewers wanted to have more of De Nero in the film but his role was not especially prominent.  The movie is well paced and holds your attention from the start. Limitless is worth a look and probably is even better the second time around.

All the software will tell me is \\"please unplug and re-plug your logitech g930 headset\\".     I am having the same problem.  I have tryed everything.  From what i can tell the drivers are not installing on my computer.  I am useing Win7 64 bit, everytime i plug them in windows tryes to install the drivers and fails.  I have installed the software from both the cd and from the updated software on the site, anyone have any more ideas???    I had the same problems as listed above.

B001CC7PP8|5.0|This two disc dvd set contains tons of special features including footage from the New York premier, production notes, on set photos, commentary, radio interview with Hitchcock, and a detailed discussion of the famous 'shower scene' that makes you appreciate its genius.    Hands down the best version of this film yet.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Well worth $1 to get rid of the annoying, performance-zapping ads that were part of the original Android version. I am happy to enjoy the angry birds the way they were meant to be!
B0041KKYEM|1.0|While every performance in this movie is superb, the STORY takes MUCH too long to develop forcing you to REALLY focus in order to keep up with what is actually happening. At times you're not sure what's real and what isn't, so you can never grasp what actually happened and what was madness.    I love Natalie Portman. She was very compelling to watch, and did a beautiful job. An under-developed role and an under-used Winona Rider also was disappointing because you had no idea why she was so bitter other than being forced to retire - another ballet cliche. Her mental illness was never developed, so her maniacal outburst is totally surprising and terrifying but a bit confusing. It's only clear at the end, which was very disappointing in that it was a cliche as well.     In addition, the first hour was totally boring. The last half hour or so was TRULY exciting, if not confusing. However, the trailers were the best part of a very dark, confusing, snorable story. Rent it, but don't get sucked into buying it like EYE did.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|I still couldn't put it down.  I wish he hadn't hung around so much on some pieces of the story, but the story is still thoroughly engaging and exceptionally well written.
B003EYVXT6|4.0|Being a huge fan of the 1931 classic 'Frankenstein', I couldn't help but find some sort of homage to the famous gothic horror tale watching this film. 'Splice' does what so many other horror films try to do and fail, it actually evokes fear! Watching this film today, I can only imagine the shock Frankenstein had on the movie going public back in 1931. This film is shocking, controversial and will certainly put some viewers off with its themes of blasphemy, bestiality, incest and rape! I had to deduct one star because the two scientist were incredibly stupid and the film just couldn't seem to shake it's \\"monster on the loose\\" origins in the end.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|This story is not as well written as the rest.  I was never able to relate at all to Renesmee.  I couldn't even imagine what she looked like.  And Edward is practically non-existent as a major character in this one.  A very disappointing ending to the series.
1594202842|5.0|This book has inspired me to be a better parent to my children.

0061537969|5.0|Oh, did I love this book!  Much like Marley & Me, I knew I was going to be emotionally destroyed at the end, but I dove in whole-heartedly, anyway.  I am such a dog lover and Enzo reminded me so much of my dog, Crash.  He \\"said\\" things that I always imagined Crash would say if he could talk.  Such a novel idea, telling a story from the perspective of a dog!<br /><br />Garth Stein really pulled this off.  This type of story could have come across as cheesy but that wasn't the case at all.  This story was touching, heartwarming, painful and honest.  A must read for all dog lovers.
0802136834|5.0|The first time I became aware of the Tudors was when I was in second grade and found in my school library a fiction children's book, written in the format of diary entries, and was purported as the childhood diary of King Henry VIII youngest daughter, Elizabeth.  Being a seven year old little girl, I was fascinated by all things pertaining to royalty, especially that of the life of a Princess.  I checked the book out and started reading it as soon as I got home.  I finished it within a week and from that point on, the craving of knowledge of all things pertaining to England's monarchy, especially the Tudors, was planted in my head.  That seed lay dormant in my subconscious for 14 years when, one night as I was watching TV, I saw a preview for a new show that was to premier on ShowTime a few months later.  That show was The Tudors.<br /><br />After watching The Tudors from beginning to end, my interest in this most famous royal dynasty was reawakened, and I started researching and reading online everything I could find about them.  Thus I came upon a plethora of non-fiction literature about them and I chose this book, Alison Weir's \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\", to be my first to introduce me to this genre of literature...and this book did not disappoint.<br /><br />If you're as interested in the Tudor family as I am I highly recommend this book.  It's a lengthy book but very much worth it to read.  Weir presents the facts of these women's lives and her exhaustive research to tell the truth about them shows and, thankfully, the book flows smoothly as if reading a story instead of just being pages upon pages of facts presented in a boring essay format.  This style of writing is what pulled me in at page 1 and kept me interested until the very last word; so interested, in fact, I regretted every time I had to put it down.<br /><br />I now look forward to reading more of Alison Weir's books about the Tudors, as well as other author's works about them.  If you decide to read this book, you won't regret it.t regret it.
B000002JBG|5.0|I love Space Jam! I love the movie and the soundtrack to it!!! I was born in the early 1990s so I remember watching this movie a lot and singing and dancing along to a lot of the good songs of the 90s! I asked my grandfather to get the soundtrack off the internet and now the entire soundtrack is on my i-pod. My grandfather gets good music off the internet. I love all the songs on the soundtrack. My personal favorites are Given You All That I Got, Hit Em High, Space Jam and For You I Will and I Believe I Can Fly! One thing I didn't like is that the song Pump Up the Jam wasn't on the soundtrack. Its the song that was played when the Loony Toons we're getting ready for their big basketball game against the Monstars! If the song is played in the movie put it on the soundtrack! Space Jam was soo good!! To bad they didn't make a sequel right after the first movie. I think if they made one now it would just wouldn't be the same or as good.
B004259BMM|5.0|I reviewed Keith's last album, and my general feeling was stale, no growth, unconvincing.  Even the song he wrote for his wife.  Obviously he was going through alot with personal issues.  That being said, this is his best album ever.  I think If I was a woman and someone wrote \\"put you in a song\\" for me I'd be flabbergasted.  KEITH MAN!  You are SOOOO back....!  I feel the joy in every note!  And to think you went through other tragedies writing all this.  Flooding of your studio, loss of many guitars, I feel the soul here!  Another album I can run down the road with the windows open and sound blasting.....\\"like a hand out the window in the wind!\\"  Thanks Keith!

B0033H7VI6|3.0|Let me start off by saying that for $40, this is a good knife.  I have no doubt it would have performed admirably as a survival/camp knife had I decided to keep it.  I returned it because of the compromises I found in the $40 worth of workmanship:  The spine of the blade was not straight, it curved slightly to the right as the blade neared its tip.  The handles were not flush with the tang, one can envision blisters and hotspots with long-term use.  Lastly, it sure seemed as though the blade weighed significantly more than the 15.9 oz the manufacturer claims.  At first I liked the heft - I didn't weigh it but the knife has got to be close to two pounds; serious kinetic energy for chopping and batoning.  Then I got to thinking, \\"Do I really want to schlep this monster on a ten mile dayhike or a three-to-five day outing?\\"  If it hadn't been for the crooked blade and the shoddy handle, I would have given the knife a chance, but all three issues taken together forced me to return it.  I'm dropping a little more coin on the Becker BK-2, which I know will have the workmanship I'm looking for.

However, I wanted to give it 5 stars to balance the two previous one-star reviews given by people who have not read the book but rated it low because they felt the price was too high.

B004EC5IV6|5.0|1.11 was a nice reboot, but 2.22 blew me away! I've never seen animation this good and the story re-engineered as it was I found just as moving as the original series. The new Eva pilot Mari was a nice infusion of energy to the story. The slight change in Rei was refreshing(not a robot). Shinji finally becomes a man. I was literally in tears at the end.

0307266303|5.0|I have had this book since Christmas, but only just found time to read it. Once I started it was very hard to put down, very well written, interesting and inspiring. I have been experimenting with barefoot running off and on for a couple of years now, but this has really inspired me to learn more and see how far I can get on my own journey. Recommended to anyone interested in learning more about some of the hidden wonders of our world.
B002ZG983M|4.0|That's the way you make a movie. You aim to do something good, you put your credibility into play, you assume that art is what you are dealing with, a phisical (audiovisual) manifestation of your soul.<br /><br />This is a good movie, one that takes a good plot and develops it narratively and aestetically convincingly. I find it very sad, trully heartbreakening, when a film that could, and therefore should, become something interesting, is spoiled because of marketability issues. When all the ingredients are good quality, and the budget is big, there is sort of a moral obligation towards the world. For instance, Transformers II is a bad, bad movie, an offense to the world. And by the way, not only in terms of artistic dignity, but also in its comicity, in the way it employs silly stereotypes and topics regarding homosexuality, masculinity, female roles, and how non Americans are and live.<br /><br />Nevermind the last sentence... I enjoyed Kick-Ass. The story is not particularly complicated, it's pretty straightforward, but it is catchy and is a perfect scenario for interesting and funny characters. The aesthetic vibe of the movie is also nice, it deals with a lot of violence, maybe a bit more than necessary, but it does with dignity. I like the bad words, the badboy and badgirl attitude, and the references to pop-comic culture. I didn't like the \\"American Pie\\" or teen movie elements, but it is a little concession to \\"marketability\\" that I am willing to accept. So, because of this last reason, and also because it is not a life changing or even a very ambitious movie, I am giving it four stars instead of five. But, hell, you do things the best you can, and you keep them simple in order not to fail at delivering more than you are able to. That's the way I like it, and I believe that if everyone in the world or cinema stuck to that rule, we would be celebrating masterpieces more often. That's the way alright.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I had the great good fortune to watch the 1973 Belmont Stakes race live on television, so my interest was piqued when this film came out on DVD. I bought it without any real expectations since I knew the ultimate outcome. I have to say I was most pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The first time I watched the movie, I wasn't that impressed as I felt there was a bit too much created drama, but the second time I watched it with my wife, she pointed out that the real story is full of drama. So I settled in and gained even more enjoyment the second time around.<br /><br />Diane Lane is exceptionally good in the lead role of Penny Chenery Tweedy, and her husband's belated admission that she was able to give their children the lessons in life that he could never do was really a tender and telling moment. John Malkovich seemed near perfect in the role of the maverick trainer, and even his admiration for Mrs. Tweedy garnered some nice concessions along the way. Mrs. Tweedy never lost faith in herself or in her horse, and that is the real lesson of the movie.<br /><br />Secretariat, or Big Red to those closest to the horse, is simply the greatest horse that ever raced (so far). Out of curiosity, I looked up some of the comparable Triple Crown records, and Secretariat clearly dominated those three races in 1973, and for all time. Some of the margins of vistory are stunning, time wise and in number of lengths. Of course, the Belmont stands out when Secretariat absolutely demolished a group of very good race horses by the unbelievable record of 31 lengths. I remember watching in 1973 to see if Secretariat could win the Triple Crown since that was the longest of the three races. I remember coming out of my chair watching Secretariat pull away in the back stretch and \\"pour on the coal\\", shouting and clapping. The movie captures this race particularly well, but for those of us who watched it live, it truly was reliving an extraordinary moment in time.<br /><br />You don't have to be a horse race fan to enjoy this movie.movie.

0316113506|4.0|It is often said that all writing is, in some way, autobiographical. Though this observation most commonly covers fictional works, it seems to apply to many forms of non-fiction as well.<br /><br />John Ratey is a practicing psychiatrist, a Harvard professor in the same field, a master explicator, and an exercise enthusiast and evangelist with, as he describes it, a fairly scattered personal history. Taken altogether, then, an ADHD/MD, fitness-buff, sort of fellow.<br /><br />Thus, it is engagingly appropriate that Spark is very much a hybrid sort of book: part meta-study, part self-help, and part polemic. (The latter sub-genre is. interestingly, synchronistic: As I was reading Spark, the news contained stories of many on the political right taking issue with First Lady Michelle Obama for her campaign to improve the nation's eating and exercise habits. Just think, one said, how many more pedestrian casualties we would have more people walked all the time.) This neither fish-nor-fowl style of writing is hard to pull off, but Ratey and co-author Eric Hagerman make it work.This is surely due, in large part, to Dr. Ratey's obvious passion for all three framings (\\"I want nothing less than to get you hooked\\"), along with Hagerman's stylistic acumen. (I do have a couple of editorial cavils, however. Well-chosen metaphors can be charming, and even enlightening. But one must be careful. Calling osteoporosis a \\"heartbreaking illness\\" is excruciatingly ill-advised, and saying that dementia \\"is not unlike when a fuse gets blown in a home's circuit breaker\\" is simply oxymoronic. Oh, well; it's hard for even the best editors to catch everything.)<br /><br />Spark's central thesis is that humans have evolved, as \\"endurance predators\\", to keep active, so it should be no surprise that movement, of the type needed for ancestral survival, is required for the proper functioning of our bodies, but, emphatically, our brains as well. Indeed, as far as complex chemistry, structure, and function are concerned, bodies and brains are two aspects of the same package. Why else, Ratey asks, would we need brains in the first place, except to move? Plants don't need brains; that is because they are quite content being in one sport.<br /><br />Through chapters dealing with Learning, Stress, Anxiety, Depression, Attentional Deficit, Addiction, Hormonal (particularly OB/GYN) Changes, and--my favorite--Aging, the formula remains the same: Describe the concept or \\"disorder\\" from a clinical point of view; discuss current theories of its etiology or development; survey established treatment (mostly pharmaceutic) protocols; and then offer exercise (usually some form of aerobic regimen, along with a nod to various relaxation and complex movement techniques) as a low-risk,high-value alternative, or, at least, adjunct.<br /><br />(To his credit, Ratey has no wish to give up on either drugs or talk therapy. Both have their places. But, according to Spark, we shouldn't rely on them exclusively when exercise is such a readily available (and even fun) holistic solution. In this regard, Jungian synchronicity rears its head once again, though I think Jung would not, in this case, have been amused. As I was writing this review, an article appeared in the New York Times about how many psychiatrists are giving up on talk therapy, mainly because they can get more bang for the buck, not to mention more bucks overall, by emulating other medical service providers. That is, in essence: see patients briefly and prescribe a lot of pills. The changes seem to make most people satisfied, including patients and, of course, insurance companies. Howbeit, this \\"fast medicine\\" approach does make me think of parallels with the fast food industry, which certainly \\"satisfies\\" customers with a lot of calories per dollar spent. Yet, somehow, the comprehensive health of the general population appears not to be improving.)<br /><br />For each chapter's discussion, Ratey backs up his claim, both theoretically and empirically, referring to (if, sadly, not actually referencing) the latest research in neurophysiology and related fields. Along the way, we are regaled with glimpses into the investigational lives of lab superstars such as Elizabeth Gould, Carl Cotman, Eric Kandel, and many others, not to mention the important work of countless anonymous, long-suffering rodentine contributors. (Rats have come a long way, we might observe, since the days for B. F. Skinner and his students.) This, however, does point up a major issue in popularizing science: Mass media accounts thrive on anecdotes and personal testimony, which scientists, in writing for other scientists, anathematize, except, perhaps, at the brainstorming, pre-hypothesis phase of dialogue.<br /><br />Nevertheless, for their educational and proselytizing purposes, Ratey and Hagerman have done a remarkable job. At least, they have inspired me to redouble my own efforts to delay or ameliorate the ravages of aging.

0756665949|4.0|For all fans with a love for LOST, this encyclopedia is for you.  The book is packed with useful information about the series including up close inspection of many Dharma Initiative products.  While the book is great for novelist looking to expand their understanding of the series, I felt that it did not go into great detail on the topics I was most interested in (i.e. The heart of the Island).  This book is a great read and will keep you entertained for hours exploring what is LOST!

1401207529|5.0|I got this comic for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. The book was exactly as I ordered it. And I believe my boyfriend liked it, because he never said anything bad about it.
0525422943|5.0|When we left Mia in If I Stay she was just waking up from a coma. Her parents and brother have been killed in a car accident and when her boyfriend Adam begs her to stay she decided not to join them but continue living. When this book opens it is three years later and we find that she left for Julliard several months after the accident. She didn't just leave Oregon behind, she left Adam.    \\"She kissed me good-bye. She told me that she loved me more than life itself. Then she stepped through security. She never came back.\\"    Now he is a famous rock star but his life is a mess because he has never gotten over the loss of Mia. He doesn't know why she left him, or what she is doing now. The book explores the events that have happened in the last three years, in flashbacks just like we reviewed Mia's life in the first book. Why did Mia leave and is there any hope for their love to be renewed?    When I started to read the book I was surprised to find that it was in Adam's voice. At first I didn't like it but I soon realized that it was a genius move by the author to explore life from his point of view. Very few novels view a love story from the male side and I found it very refreshing. The prose is beautiful and the story is emotionally powerful. Forman has created some very compelling characters here, people who have real life flaws and problems. There is no glossing over the problems Adam has experienced since Mia walked out of his life. And the message that fame and fortune are not always the answer was impressive. Flawed though he may be I found myself hoping that things would work out for Adam. The flow of events was very realistic and touching and having worked with people experiencing grief it was clear the author did her research on this subject. The book is a wonderful example of how love can destroy, heal and help overcome life's obstacles. Fans of the first book will find a satisfying sequel, I liked it better than the first book. If you have not read the first book you can pick up this one and still enjoy the it. I highly recommend this one.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|Why I Read this Book: This book is a must read for anyone who's read If I Stay. In fact, if you've already read If I Stay, chances are you been anxiously awaiting the release for the sequel. There was a pretty big cliffhanger at the end of If I Stay and if you're like me, you need to know what happens next. And you get that closure in Where She Went.    What I Liked: If I Stay was a great emotional and thought-provoking read. And because I was late jumping on the reading bandwagon (I didn't read that book until late last year), lucky for me I didn't have too long to wait for the answers that are found in Where She Went. If I Stay was first published in January of 2009, so some people have been waiting over 2 years for closure. Well wait no more, the time has finally come! Today is release day for Where She Went.    I really liked that this book was told from Adam's POV (1st person narrative). If I Stay was completely Mia's story; her traumatic experience, her story, her flashbacks. In Where She Went, we finally get Adam's side of the story; from back when Mia was in a coma from the accident until now, 3 years later. It was good to see where and how Adam and Mia each ended up 3 years after her tragic accident.    Adam pours his heart and emotions into his lyrics and shares them with the world. Every other chapter leads with a sampling of Adam's lyrics. Angst, torment and bitter emotions drip from his words.    One of my favorite lines (that accurately describes Mia's present journey) is Gran's theory on why Mia was afraid of butterflies when she was younger:      \\"She said it was because one day I was going to have to go through a metamorphosis like a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly and that scared me, so butterflies scared me.\\"      What I Didn't Like: Adam was a bit annoying at times with his whining. His character has had to grieve and he's had some growing up to do. He knows that Mia hasn't had an easy road but the void is not easy for him to digest.Overall Impression: Where She Went is a great companion novel. I got the emotional read I was expecting and the closure I needed. Gayle Forman brings a wide range of emotions to these pages, even the raw and gritty kind, and sometimes they come in waves. Have the tissues ready.

B002ZG9800|4.0|What would you do to be with the one you love?  The hilarious true story of gay con-man Steven Russell (Carrry) and Phillip Morris (McGregor).  After a series of cons and theft lands him in jail Russell meets Morris and it's love at first site.  The lengths Russell goes to in order to make Morris happy land him in more and more trouble with the law.  This movie is very, very funny, but because of the subject matter won't be seen by that many people.  There are a few pretty graphic scenes in this, with the worst being in the first fifteen minutes, but the fact that Carrey and McGregor play gay lovers the same way a man and a woman would (Carrey and McGregor have more chemistry on screen then Depp and Jolie did) it will lose a lot of viewers who won't give it a chance.  This is Carrey's best performance since playing Andy Kaufman in \\"Man On The Moon\\", and again I think because this movie wasn't widely released because of people being frightened of the subject matter he did not get the recognition he deserved.  I have not seen \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" so I can't compare this to that, but I really enjoyed this movie.  This movie is a very funny comedy, but will only be seen as a \\"Gay\\" movie and won't get the viewers it deserves.  That is a real shame. I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I think I might.

B004FRX0MY|3.0|I jumped all over the opportunity to access my music from my home computer anywhere, as much as I love Pandora and Slacker I actually like the music in my personal library. I hate the load/reload convert drama going from different MP3 players, so I thought that I would be in music heaven with the Android app. NOT so much. There are way too many issues with buffering for me (I have a Motorola Atrix) and most times when I have tried to use the app I have been in 4G or on Wi-Fi. I like being able to access the cloud player via internet, but I really wanted to have access to my library through my phone, and just have that device as my MP3 player. I'm hoping that future fixes may address the problem.

B0047Y17P2|1.0|Like all the others I am outraged by this Kindle price point.

1592402690|5.0|I didn't get around to reading this book until March 2011, but I am glad I did. Emerick really gives a different angle on the Beatle personalities , which was downright fascinating. This guy was nearly a genius in his ability to record as well as he did in , primarily, 4-track. He was given alot of orders by Lennon to make the music sound like he was spinning around and the like. Emerick was able to improvise and accommodate these requests to the satisfaction of Lennon , McCartney and George Martin. No easy task.  This is , straightaway, the best book on the Beatles that I have read , including Spitz' bio of the group. Has a nice flow to it and is interlaced with British expressions that were amusing , and overall, entertaining on a variety of levels. Really, really enjoyed this book.
0670022411|4.0|Ms. Harkness has hooked me with her first installment of the witches. Some reviewers have said the plot is slow; others have said it was fast-paced. I will say that if you aren't really a biblophile or a history buff, you might find parts of the book slow. However, for me, I found the \\"educational\\" or \\"background\\" info very fulfilling and to the point of the story. There is a richness inside the plot, subplots very softly laid out and I liked not being smacked with them. The characters of Diana and Michael, our key players, are a bit bumpy at first, but soon Ms. Harkness finds a rhythm for them and you can actually feel it in the writing.<br /><br />The plot is tried and true - a woman who has great power, has been denying her heritage. And then it gets more original with a book, a vampire and war among the supernaturals over a witch and her illicit love. The story comes bursting forth to the horror and delight of many, kicking off a mystery, a challenge, a blood war and a magic compendium that will delight all sorts of readers (there are daemons, vampires, witches to please all).  And I also think the plot moves in more unexpected and exciting ways than many supernatural or fantasy books out here today. I actually felt as though I was reading new twists to old ideas.<br /><br />One more thing I enjoyed:  This is not a tween's Twilight, nor is it a Rice's Mayfair Witches w/a side order of Lestat. This is a love story wrapped in a supernatural thriller supported by intriguing and mysterious characters (a demon lawyer, vampire knights, witches galore, and vampire wizards mixed with vengence. There is blood and pain, and love and lust. It is meant for adults, isn't an epic, but is a tightly-crafted tale.<br /><br />My only complaint is I felt our heroine endured a bit too much physically for my reality. When I closed the book I felt that Ms. Harkness put Diana through more abuse than I could believe she might be able to handle so quickly. But that may be a personal observation and does in no way change my opinion of the overall story. The poor woman's body gets beat up quite a bit.<br /><br />I highly recommend A Discovery of Witches (and even the title is a hint within the story). Nearly 600 pages, I was surprised how easily it read, how much I enjoyed the history, and - being a book lover myself - how I was caught up in the details. I didn't want to stop reading but was forced to let this go over several days. You won't want to stop either and yes, you will feel a bit frustrated having to wait a year for the next installment.  If book two is as good, we will have a huge hit on our hands here. Highly recommended.way change my opinion of the overall story. The poor woman's body gets beat up quite a bit.

B004KSQN7C|3.0|Britney Spears' \\"Femme Fatale\\" album puts me in a bit of an odd place.  As a dance music fan, I love the music.  For the most part, it's of-the-moment energetic \\"thumpy\\" Eurodisco, with a tiny bit of pop and New Wave thrown in for diversity.  It's well-produced and the overall sound is first-rate.      The problem I have is with what's been done to Britney's vocals.  Now, I have no disillusions whatsoever in terms of her singing abilities: the girl's not all that talented vocally.  But the way in which the producers have manipulated, processed, and completely disguised her vocals is baffling.  If you didn't know it was a Britney Spears album, you could easily picture any number of faceless studio singers at the microphone.  The vocals are *that* anonymous.    So, am I happy with it?  Yes, but to a point.  It'll be short-lived.  As of this writing, Gaga will release her new \\"Born This Way\\" CD in about five weeks.  After that, I know I won't be the only one saying, \\"Britney Who?\\".

And the ending, when the fellow starts to get up and leave, and to watch Benny's face!

B001OQCV6A|4.0|I agree with those reviewers who feel that this film is more successful in its characterizations of Holmes and Watson than the Rathbone/Bruce films so popular years ago. I'm always happy to see a Holmes film that does not make Watson the bumbling idiot that Bruce did so well in those tributes to Conan Doyle's favorites.  The Jeremy Brett series also does a great job at showing Watson to be a truly valuable associate that Holmes really does rely on quite a bit on several occasions.  I still have to admit that I adore Basil's Holmes without a doubt but was extremely satisfied with Downey's take on the man also.  I loved the chemistry between Downey and Law and would love to see more of them together in these roles. I thought Mary Morstan was not very well portrayed but there's not a whole lot to go on as far as her personality in respect to her and Watson as a couple though of course she is their first client in the stories.  The Irene Adler angle was cute and I feared they would let the sensuality go too far with she and Holmes and it did come close but luckily the movie makers backed off before they had officially blown it.  Sherlock would never let himself become distracted over a female - not even a hot one.  He's polite and often kind to women where appropriate but he does not dwell on them in any other way - including Irene.  He's impressed with her intelligence and respects her for it.  That's all!  But we must allow Guy Ritchie some leeway and some fun here and he does it without disrespecting our heroes original image. I thought Jude Law was tremendous - can't overstate that here - and Downey was funny and clever though I would have liked to have seen him do more of what we love Holmes for (the facts from small items) without so many of the small facts being so contrived.  I wish they hadn't made the supernatural an aspect of this - even though the explanations are based on truths and not on metaphysical mumbo jumbo - it still was a bit of a sell out and I wish mysteries in general would avoid the Scooby Doo themed stuff.  (Except when it is Scooby of course).  I loved the music and the art theme and creative direction in this movie. Mark Strong is scary and unattractive as the bad guy (wow - Mr. Knightley sure looks different huh?).  Oh and love the fact that the script made a point of mentioning Mycroft (Sherlock's older bro).

Matthew Broderick was perfect for this role, and it's the only movie I can think of that pulls of an entertaining mix of story line and the removal of \\"the forth wall\\". Having Ferris speaking as if to the audience made the movie both fun and revealing without being over done. If you are a fan of John Hughes, this is a must have.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The previous two books in the series suffered from being overly wordy...this one is a bit better in that department.  It's much better in overall structure and format and I have wondered if this is due to translation more so than Larsson's actual writings (same with the \\"too wordy\\" issue).  In short, if you enjoyed making it through the first two of the series, it is well worth reading this final book and seeing how things pan out.  Larsson did a great job dropping hints at plot points throughout the series, and all come to fruition nicely.

A movie from a time when Hollywood was still creating original ideas and not spewing out rehashed madness and sloppy remakes.

U2 takes their iconic role to heart, and perhaps that's what has made them great for so long. In order to \\"enjoy\\" this book, I had to remind myself that if I had spent 33 years in their spotlight, I too might be more serious about life.

B003EYVXUU|4.0|This is an outstanding movie.  While it is admittedly somewhat predictable in the beginning, this does not take away from the movie at all.  There are so few movies that I look forward to seeing that actually meet my expectations.  This one actually surpassed them all.  The acting is great.  The storyline is great.  The relationship building is great.  If you want to see a horror movie that is actually anything but, watch this one.  I guarantee that you will not be dissapointed.

He shows how you have to put in time and pay your dues to make it to the level he has.  It makes me hungry for more about his recent life.

Actually worse yet, it's one of those movies which just leaves one apathetic;  ie it was ok, but nothing beyond that.  It's so irrelevant that it's not worth even discussing at work with friends etc...<br />2.  Bottomline, skip this dud of a movie, unless you happen to come across it for free etc... But even then, is your time worth anything?

B002TZS5GU|4.0|Written and directed by the brothers &Agrave;lex and David Pastor this was their first film to get a large showing at the box office. While not the first project either of the two have worked on it easily proves that they know exactly how to put together a well laid out post apocalyptic film.<br /><br />Set shortly after an unknown outbreak spread across the land killing a majority of the populace we follow a group of 4 friends (two brothers and their women they are dating) who are trying to reach an old beach house they know of which is so secluded they believe they can live there peacefully. One of my favorite aspects of this is we never see exactly the horrors of the outbreak - just the immediate after effects. It is not so far past the occurrence that everything has been looted, destroyed, or worn down due to time, but far enough that seeing other humans is rare. When we do see remnants of humanity - it's a world where clearly everyone is out for themselves.<br /><br />We are introduced to Brian (Chris Pine) the outgoing brother, Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci) who is more the brain to Brian's brawn, Brian's girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo), and the girl Danny is interested in Kate (Emily Vanvamp) and are easily shown who is who, their personalities, and how they interact with one another. It's four people in a very tense situation and they show how it can grate on their nerves and still have them come together. As mentioned above it's a very desolate area they are in and while they do meet up with 3 separate groups of people it is just to help advance the story - the story being our set of 4 friends.<br /><br />Most post apocalyptic films take the easy way out and bring up zombies or man v man with everyone out for themselves. This story shows how the group progresses from trying to help others, to being harmed by others, to blatantly in one case on Brian's part just taking what they need. Even when this happens though the true fleshing out of both caring, understanding, and all of the `good' parts of human nature has not been left out. I am not going to focus much on the three groups of people they meet up with (aside to point out that less time is spent with each group as time goes on) aside from the first group as it was a father (Christopher Meloni) and his infected daughter (Kiernan Shipka.) These were the most interesting of the non-main characters in the film as Christopher's character is just a man who wants to save his daughter who won't take no for an answer and is able to do so with words while Kiernan, for being so young, was able to play such a perfect roll.<br /><br />The movie knew how to bring up tension, show off human nature, and kill off important cast members without it seeming abrupt or without purpose. Everything fit well together and I cannot wait to see what the Pastor brothers put together next and can only hope that it is in the horror genre. If you are a fan of post apocalyptic films this is probably the best one created in 2009.of human nature has not been left out.

B002C949KE|5.0|When it comes to management or leadership guides, this is one of the best books I've read (well heard) in the last decade. It is above all insightful, but also practical, solid, humorous and (although occasionally redundant) extremely well researched. If you are interested in understanding how people tick, or how your people think and why they are acting the way they are, this book is a must-read. For leaders (but also for anyone involved with people) this book provides simple and practical examples and informative insights into how to motivate and engage people more effectively. Of course, the information in this book could be misused to manipulate people, but I will give the benefit of the doubt to all leaders, and simply remind them that there are ethical codices and a series of commandments that govern our lives... (if you wonder why I say this, and how I think it could have any effect on people's behaviour, I encourage you to read the book!)
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|Christopher Smith is a partial newcomer to cinema, at least quantity wise. He's been making films since 1997 however this is only his 5th movie to date. This one though has made me want to see where he is going as a filmmaker and excited about his 6th film which comes out next year. While I can't claim that this was the best horror film that I've seen this year the unique way it was presented with such a very underused premise was brilliant to watch.<br /><br />The story involves a group of 'friends' who are going out to sea on a yacht for the day. By group of friends I of course mean they all know the owner of the yacht but really don't know each other for the most part making it hard for them to easily interact with one another. It's a great reason on bringing a group of strangers together that makes sense without having to try to bring up a long and drawn out back story. All you need to do is focus on the potential love interest of the owner of the yacht - Jess. A single mother and clearly out of it Jess is the major character to follow throughout this story as she is the first to realize something is out of the norm.<br /><br />While at sea there is a flash storm of epic proportions that destroys the yacht and we see the group survive and picked up by a passing ocean liner. I use picked up rather loosely as it pulls up right next to them and they hop on without it stopping. It's not every day where you see an ocean liner that is apparently empty of passengers and crew alike. While it appears deserted you know as well as I that while watching a horror movie a deserted area is never truly deserted and soon after the killing starts. Someone is hunting this group of friends.<br /><br />Now when you have such a small group of people that been rescued you would wonder how they can all be killed rather quickly and still allow the movie to easily go forward? Without realistically spoiling a single thing they are quickly removed and it quickly becomes clear that \\"Jess\\" is both the main character and the only one that matters. However, this is quickly shown how it is possible though the explanation isn't readily apparent until further into the movie. There is a twist that comes up that reminds me of a few science fiction plots I have seen in my day though never put into such a fun horror themed world. It's hard to go into great detail with the story line without touching on what the twist is or how it plays out, which is a shame because said twist is what will make or break the movie for you.<br /><br />The film itself carries through to the end and has a strong finish that makes you truly feel that you finally see what is actually going on. It's not a 'unique' idea in horror but one that is rarely used and never quite like this. If you want something that is mostly original and not your everyday horror movie (yet still a slasher flick at heart) this one is a great one to pick up or rent.r and the only one that matters.

B0047Y17P2|1.0|I intended to purchase the ebook version of The Fifth Witness today, but now I have decided to hold back in support of the protest vote.  I normally disagree with using what is arguably an opinion-based ranking system  to reflect anything other than the merits of a book.  However, price is always a relevant factor in determining the value of works of art, and here readers, clearly angered with the higher- priced ebook of a favorite author,  have chosen to make it a determining factor.  When Amazon changed its ebook pricing structure last year, it warned authors and publishers of the consequences of a significant protest vote for higher priced ebooks and how it could affect Amazon hourly sales--which is exactly what is happening here. Mr. Connelly and Little, Brown and Company accepted that risk, and the result is that both are now incurring the wrath of die-hard fans, including myself.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The most bizarre feature of the controversies surrounding The Passion of the Christ is the accusation of anti-Semitism. Jesus' persecution and execution was entirely an intra-Jewish issue, until the Jewish leaders had to take it to the Roman officials. This was a Jewish man with Jewish followers and he was tried by a Jewish court. If this is anti-Semitic, then the story of Moses being nearly stoned by angry Israelites (Numbers 14:10) is also anti-Semitic. How absurd! Was Jeremiah anti-Semitic for denouncing Jewish kings, leaders, priests, prophets, scribes, and common people for their sins? Or is the Hebrew scripture anti-Semitic for recording how the Jewish kings, leaders, and people persecuted and sometimes killed the prophets and the righteous? Yet when the New Testament records Jewish persecution of Jesus and his Jewish followers, that's anti-Semitic?! Suppose one of the Hebrew kings, before killing a prophet, were to have said, \\"Let his blood be upon us and our children.\\" No one would have given the statement a second thought and, definitely, no one would assume this curse actually applied to all of Israel. He didn't even have the right to apply it to his own children because the Hebrew scripture teaches that each person must bear his or her own guilt (Jeremiah 31:29-30).     I think my words will be wasted because people will see only what they want to see. When anti-Christian paranoia reaches this peak of absurdity, reason is powerless to be heard.    Gibson's masterpiece is the surely the greatest depiction of Jesus' death ever to be produced on film. Jesus was killed by both Jews and Gentiles. We're all guilty of his death and need the reconciliation with God only that death can bring.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|This is considered \\"historical fiction\\" - a fiction based on historical facts. It mainly concerns itself with the feelings of the Bolelyn family at the time of their greatest power and their rapid fall from grace. It is a very well told tale with 2 very solid performances from Portman and Johanson as the 2 Bolelyn sisters.  I don't mind speculating on how historical characters may have felt or their motivations or desires. Where I do object is when they alter the facts to create what they feel must be better drama:  -Mary had already been the mistress of the French king when she met Henry.   -Henry had in fact had many mistresses prior to Mary. So neither Henry nor Mary were the innocents at adultery portaryed in the movie.  -Henry was also an older and heavier man at this time than the character Bana portays. He had been married almost 25 years at that time.  So while this is a worthwhile movie that does get some of the facts right, I think it loses a bit when it tries to rewrite the facts. The facts alone are great drama. 3.5 Stars.
0316069353|4.0|Mickey Haller is front and center in The Fifth Witness. Connolly introduced Mickey in Lincoln Lawyer (soon to be a major motion picture with Matthew McConaughey). Mickey is a defense attorney trying to rebuild his life and his legal business. Mickey is a twice divorced and a recovering alcoholic. He has a young daughter and two ex-wives with whom he is on good terms. In the Fifth Witness Mickey continues to conduct his legal business in the back seat of his Lincoln Town Car, but today his business is primarily representing homeowners in the midst of home foreclosures. One of Mickey's clients, Lisa Trammel is accused of the murder of the banker who is overseeing her foreclosure. We are treated to what feels like a real life look at a legal defense - a client who is not likeable, wrangling between the defense and the prosecution, an annoying media presence, and cynicism all around. Haller and most of his team are convinced that Trammel is guilty but they continue to provide a first rate defense.<br /><br />Several story lines emerge that get Haller and his team investigating the foreclosure apparatus and the nefarious characters who work in it. Evidence that is uncovered supports Trammel's innocence. .. Let me say no more and ruin the suspense. If you read Michael Connolly you'll love the Fifth Witness, if you don't give it a try, it is highly enjoyable.
0525422943|5.0|I wonder if it is ok that I liked [[ASIN:0525422943 Where She Went]] so much more than its predecessor. I mean, [[ASIN:B004R96SPQ If I Stay]] was all about people dying and lying in coma and there were hardly any tears in my eyes and here I spent hours sobbing over a guy's broken heart? Am I that much into emo guys?<br /><br />Don't think that's the answer though. Super-emo [[ASIN:0545123275 Shiver (Wolves of Mercy Falls)]]'s Sam and [[ASIN:0316077038 Beautiful Creatures]]'s Ethan didn't rock my boat and how could they with their obsessions over puffy coats, Scarlett O'Hara and leaky womb type poetry? Adam Wilde is emo of a different, Tom Mackee ([[ASIN:0763647586 The Piper's Son]]) kind. He is broken, messed up, hopeless, talented and he can love!<br /><br />Adam's story was just so, so bitter. Throughout the book I felt that exactly like him, I was filled with pain and resentment towards Mia's decisions. The eventual release of all the pent-up anger (accompanied my uncontrollable sobs) was, I believe, as cathartic for me as it was for Adam. This book was a fantastic study of grief, loss and forgiveness. Beautifully, beautifully written.<br /><br />Ladies, have you hankies ready for this one, 'cause I am tearing up again just thinking about it.

Honestly, \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" is one of my favorite books I have ever read, the 1000+ pages took me less than 5 days because I simply could not put it down. If you're looking for a great new fantasy author, Patrick Rothfuss is one of the best, and The Kingkiller Chronicles is a great read. Highly recommended!

Nice premise but it didn't carry throughout the novel. Although very technical, I found the characters week and the situations predictable.

I happen to agree that being loving and positive person helps in life. Would you want to hang out with someone who is always unhappy and does nothing but complain. The answer is no! Sure it is easier to find a partner if you are loving and easy going person. I don't quite understand why you need to write 200 pages of the repetitive phrases followed by exclamation points. I guess the power of positive thinking works for her because so many people, including myself bought the book. She is a good businesswoman! I would give her five stars in that department. What I find very disturbing is that author goes beyond  just saying that it is good to stay positive and to believe in yourself and makes statement like, \\" you are not recovering from illness because you aren't imagining yourself healthy!\\"  So my friend who has been paralyzed at the age of 23 with no hopes of walking again is doing it to himself because he is not imagining himself walking!\\"   What about unemployment ? According to the book all the unemployed people in USA are just too negative and if they only had imagined themselves at work the jobs would appear! Well! well! Obama should just read this book and unemployment rates in this country will drop overnight! Just imagine! No national debt and lots of jobs! Or and by the way when millions died in concentration camps during WW II it mostly had happened because they weren't  imagining  themselves alive! They just didn't love enough!     I have to praise the author for being a good business woman. The book is just a collection of phrases and inspirational quotes! It is not a help book! I would not call it a book!

Mr. Connelly does it again. The only thing that I \\"witnessed\\" reading, The Fifth Witness was ...brilliance! I swallowed this book whole and had read about half way through this book before I put it down and walked away from it for a moment. I like Mickey. He is smart, tactful, a people's attorney and an all around good guy. Lisa was a surprise. A nice surprise. I thought Mickey and Lisa played well off each other. They helped build off each other. There was a good, steady pace throughout this book with a few twists along the way. I can not wait to read the nest Mickey Haller novel.

But \\"The Holographic Universe\\" stands above the fray, not for its lucid and inspirational style alone, but the unique take and perceptions of its author, as well.<br /><br />Talbot saw this as the long-anticipated unifying model or meta-hypothesis that would eventually absolve the tensions of competing perspectives between emerging new theories and conventional consensus, inevitably leading to the next great scientific revolution in history.<br /><br />Revisiting Marilyn Ferguson's recapitulation in \\"Brain/Mind Bulletin\\" of the anatomy of a paradigm shift described by Thomas Kuhn in his 1962 classic, \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\",  Talbot demonstrates how the holographic theory accommodates a myriad of anomalies accumulated in modern research, data about which any speculations are systematically rejected by peer-reviewed journals because of their tendency to challenge the finality of established prevailing paradigms within the natural sciences.<br /><br />Talbot explains in credible terms how phenomena that pervade human existence -- subjective experiences of psi, poltergeists, precognition, clairvoyance, past-life memories, close encounters, UFO abductions, visions and apparitions, remote viewing, near-death and out-of-body episodes -- find common ground in the scientific framework of a worldview suggested by the reality Bohm and Pribram have proposed in tandem.<br /><br />Accounts of exceptional human experience -- though they demonstrate a conspicuous familiarity across time and space -- are unable to meet the standard of empirical evidence required by the scientific method to support any hypotheses.<br /><br />Talbot asks that given what we know about the observer effect recognized in many domains of physics (changes which the act of observation makes on phenomenon being observed; often the result of instruments that alter the state of what they measure) why should clinical observations of scientists weigh more heavily than personal experiences of the lay public?<br /><br />If science is founded on the pursuit of truth, the author contends, it must one day accept the human mind and consciousness as valid sources of evidence when making assumptions about the nature of reality.<br /><br />\\"Two of the world's most eminent thinkers believe the universe may be a giant hologram, a kind of image or construct created at least, in part, by the human mind,\\" Talbot contended. \\"This remarkable way of looking at the universe explains many of the unsolved puzzles of physics, and also such mysterious occurrences as telepathy, out-of-body and near death experiences, lucid dreams, and even religious and mystical experiences such as feelings of cosmic unity and the occurrence of miracles.\\"mework of a worldview suggested by the reality Bohm and Pribram have proposed in tandem.  Accounts of exceptional human experience -- though they demonstrate a conspicuous familiarity across time and space -- are unable to meet the standard of empirical evidence required by the scientific method to support any hypotheses.

This game may be simple, but it is simple in a fun and addicting way.
B004M66YSA|5.0|Sophomore release from New York press darlings lives up to the hype...gorgeously addictive,<br />  irresistibly melodic post-shoegaze pop packed with a ton of hooky choruses, compellingly sweet<br />  vocals and smoothly roaring dream-pop guitar riffs.  There are no new inventions here, but this<br />  may be as close to \\"perfect\\" as formulaic shoegaze pop can get.  Every song is a stick-in-your-<br />  head keeper.  Two big pop thumbs pointing toward the sky here!  Similarities to Jesus & Mary<br />  Chain, The Raveonettes, New Order, Ride, Asobi Seksu.
B004SCN2F6|4.0|I loved space trader on my palm pilot. It got me through more than one college class. When I discovered that the brothers Trese were making a very similar game on android, I wad very exited.<br /><br />Star Traders is faithful to the original Palm game in many respects, but it has been extended to well beyond the scope of the original. The result is that you feel like you are playing the upgraded and second incarnation of a classic, rather than a game with no soul or context.<br /><br />One great thing about Star Traders (and one reason you should support the developers) is that the game continues to receive frequent updates. While the game is feature complete, you really do get the feeling that the Trese brothers are asking themselves &quot;What kind of game do we want to play?&quot;, and then making it, rather than focusing on how to make money. The down side to this is that in some sense you can see that there are ideas in their minds that haven't been implemented in the game yet, which can at times be a bit frustrating.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the best RPG games in the market at the moment, and is definitely worth your money.
0316069353|1.0|I haven't read the book yet but expect it to be great. I am taking a que from my fellow readers and using this forum to protest the high prices for Kindle books. I will go back to my original book club to buy the latest releases and save a ton of money. The author will still get his share but at a fair price. I will start to use my kindle as the toy it's turning out to be and play games with my kids. Most of them are free. I expect that will change soon since the kindle folk are showing their greedy side. I will no longer buy the high priced books, new or old, and will stick with my vast list of choices and purchase only the bargain price books, if any, on kindle. Somewhere along the line kindle and the authors lost touch with their readers and are trying to exploit us and get rich quick off our dime. Well, I for one will not take it anymore...just like in the movie's \\"I'm mad as hell...\\". I'm one, let's make it a million protests and maybe they'll get the message. Don't sit on your hands. Type a few words of protest and let them hear our voice.

1423113381|5.0|THE RED PYRAMID is the first in a new series, the Kane Chronicles, by best-selling author Rick Riordan.  The story is narrated by a brother-sister duo, Carter and Sadie Kane, who were separated as youngsters and have only recently been re-united.  What they never knew was that they not only come from a long line of Egyptian magicians from the famous House of Life, but they both also possess blood of the pharaohs.<br /><br />This makes them important, albeit reluctant, heroes when the gods of ancient Egypt are accidentally freed.  In this book, Set, the god of Chaos, has kidnapped their father and has frightening plans that will affect the future of the world as we know it.  So, Carter and Sadie embark on a quest to save, well, both, if they can.  They just might do it with a little help from a few miscellaneous Egyptian gods--including Bast--and a Khufu, an extremely insightful baboon.<br /><br />Fans of Riordan's Percy Jackson series will enjoy his trademark humor, adventure, mystery and suspense all rolled into one entertaining package.<br />--Reviewed by Michelle Delisle
B00005ARDC|4.0|Of all the BRMC albums, this is the one to get before they went and tried to go country before returning to this sound of late. Even so it's an updated ripoff of the Jesus and Mary Chain sound.<br /><br />The other problem is less than half this album has any good songs (\\"Love Burns,\\" \\"Red Eyes And Tears,\\" \\"Whatever Happened To MY Rock 'N' Roll\\" and \\"White Palms\\"). The rest are just filler.
0312370849|3.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" is a work of fiction by Tatiana de Rosnay. Although the characters within Rosnay's book are fictional, the background for her story is base on a real life occurrence. The novel is 320 page long.<br /><br />*GENERAL THEME SPOILER* (no specific details given)<br /><br />A story in two parts, told in an alternating and sequential format.<br /><br />1.) In July 1942, in Nazi-occupied Paris, Jews  were continuing to be gathered for deportation. This tale deals with one such story as it follows 10 year old Sarah Starzynski and her family during their ordeal with what was to become later known as the Velodrome d'Hiver round-up...one of France's darkest humanitarian events of WW II. Memorable in itself, yet easily forgotten by most of the populous because it was ordered by the then Vichy government and carried out by French policemen.<br /><br />2.) In 2002, Parisian journalist Julia Jarmond, is assigned to cover the sixtieth anniversary of the Vel d'Hiv round-up and in doing so, discovers not only many forgotten facts but also several older people who had personal recollections of this horrific event and in particular with Sarah and her family. And shockingly to Ms. Jarmond, some of these people are very close to her in real life. Thus the quest for Sarah's tale begins.<br /><br />*END SPOILER*<br /><br />This is at times a very sobering and emotional story, replete with all the cruelty that once again demonstrates man's inhumanity to man. Sarah's tale is a testimony to perseverance under truly trying times. The reader will have no difficulty feeling her fear, her guilt and her overwhelming sense of sisterly love, loyalty and responsibility for her younger brother.<br /><br />And yet, for all the wonderful writing and intrigue found in the first two-thirds of this book, I was disappointed with the remainder. Once Sarah's story ended, the book seemed to focus more on Julia's own personal agenda. There came a point that I found myself wishing the tale had ended. I had the feeling that the author was trying to do too much...that somehow she overshot her true ending. The last part of the book seemed to me somewhat contrived and scripted, and because of this the  entire book lost some of it's intangible magic.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A tale of the Holocaust that was emotionally and beautifully written. The pacing for the first two-thirds was superb. A story that was truly sad, and yet in ways, sadly true when one reflects back on some of the atrocities that occurred in Nazi-occupied Europe of the 1940s. Unfortunately a weak and somewhat disappointing ending. 3 1/2  Stars<br /><br />Ray Nicholsono much...that somehow she overshot her true ending.

B000YAA68W|5.0|The choice of \\"drawing\\" the movie in black and white artwork was a inspired choice as its themes are hardly black and white. There's good and bad but mostly bad created by those in power be it during the times of the Shah or the mullahs in Iran. The look of the movie is very graphic novel which makes sense because it comes from the same. It does have some genuinely scary, poignant, touching and funny scenes. The filmmaker is a true talented individual.<br />It also helps that she is speaking from the heart as it is her story of her childhood through early 20s trying to figure out her own self but being driven down an almost suicidal hole by the grind that is modern Iran.<br /><br />Some interesting asides: The fact that Iron Maiden may be considered \\"punk\\" and/or revolutionary let alone the lame sounds of Michael Jackson or ABBA just shows you how freaked out and paranoid the religious leaders are in Iran. Imagine their reaction if they found Iran's youth secretly listening to the Sex Pistols, Clash or any other classic punk.<br /><br />The flip from black-and-white to color when the movie shows scenes in Paris is all that's needed to show how the West, for all its faults, is a place where people can be free from this sort of horrible repression they find in nations like modern Iran.<br /><br />The extras are almost as good as the movie.<br />The Hidden Side is way too long at over 30 minutes.<br />Behind-the-Scenes has Marjane Satrapi (co-director and the person whom is the central character of the movie) and is in English. You get Iggy Pop (voice actor in the English version of the movie) popping up, too!<br />Cannes Press Conference Q&A has Catherine Denevue whose voice I did not recognize in the movie but she played the grandma.<br />Selected Scene Commentaries are fun but the piece de resistance is the Animated Scene Comparisons. It's fun to see what was cut out and learn why as well as see some of the rough-cut animation in action.
B004P02OJ6|5.0|It's a simple premise really: \\"A happy family > separate happy family > (makes everyone unhappy) > try and reunite family to be happy again.\\"       It worked.  I very much wanted to see the family back together again.      I watched this film hoping for a good, suspenseful, well thought-out drama/thriller and was not disappointed.   I think Crowe picks projects that are top notch with good story-telling elements.      I wasn't bored (I read a review who said they were.. and I thought perhaps they might have been asleep, but not bored..) and in my opinion Crowe makes his character really come to life.  I'm not sure what it was, but his performance reminded me at moments of how he was in 'A Beautiful Mind'.   Maybe it was the mania that eventually overcame the protagonist in dire moments of decision and his ability to keep the level of intrigue heightened, I don't know.  But it was worked for me.    'The Next Three Days' wasn't totally predictable which was a relief.   He played a masculine yet sensitive even sentimental community college professor ultimately willing to do whatever it took to keep family intact.  He loves his wife and child. That always works, it worked on me.   I found his emotive range to be unexpected and rich and that made me root for him, even in questionable situations.   I don't recall the actress in the film (so sorry!) but I've seen her before and thought she also did a very good job and was well suited with Crowe.  It was a satisfying film, but then again, I am old-fashioned, I like a good story, well-told, and if there are some explosions or guns fired with other action involved, that's OK with me...    My thumbs are up on this one.  I watch plenty of films and this one has stayed more toward the top of the heap as of late.   And I'm not a professional film reviewer, just somebody who loves a good movie with story and character driven sensibilities.
B0033TJATW|5.0|I've always enjoyed watching this movie as a little kid and it was a pleasure to pass this down to my children because they love watching it now.
0316069353|1.0|I have enjoyed almost all other Michael Connelly books, especially Mickey Haller books. I have no doubt that this one will also be excellent. I am joining fellow Kindle readers in protesting the unreasonable higher cost of the Kindle edition than the hardcover edition. I believe that someone is getting very greedy. I will not pay a premium for buying books to read on the Kindle device. Someone made the choice to price the Kindle e-book higher than the hardcover book, and it has nothing to do with higher costs. Printing and distributing a book is obviously a costlier endeavor. Every decision is a choice. To those that made this decision, not a good choice at all.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This movie is so many things to so many people - in the theatre I watched it with kids as young as four and others my age (over 50)...we all loved it and for many different reasons.  The emotions this movie brings up - I laughed and cried - several times.    I LOVE this movie.  No one does it better than Disney and Pixar...add in Tom Hanks and Tim Allen - over the moon!!!  You've got a friend in me...
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|This one really hit me in the gut the first time I saw it. What an incredible cast! Hines, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Isabella Rossellini, always very beautiful, and course, Helen Mirren. A great story, cool dance scenes, and a chance for Gregory Hines to show his acting skills.<br /> A compelling story set against the Cold War when a famous defector falls back into the hands of the Government he rejected, and another defector has a bad case of 'buyers remorse'. They work together to escape their captors. Loved it. Another great purchase from Amazon @ a great price.
1439102813|5.0|5 stars!! Phenomenal book about a woman in her early 50's and her early-onset of Alzheimers.<br />Just turning 50 Alice, a Doctorate Professor of Psycology at Harvard starts noticing that she is forgetting words, appointments, and even getting lost during a run. She consults a neurologist and they go through numerous tests, first being told it is probably depression, or fatique. Further testing pushed by her husband John, results in a diagnosis of early onset Alzheimers .<br />  This book is written from Alice's perspective. The alertness and detailed life of Alice at first, to the last chapter when she is mostly unaware. Brilliant in that it not only is taken from Alice's perspective, but also that it is written so well that you see the emotional changes that her husband and children go through as they become to accept her diagnosis. Their struggle to understand, to live their own lives, yet to go on with their own.<br />  Fantastic details about alzheimers, studies on it, medications and how they work, and the brain activity. Only a Doctor in Neuroscience like Lisa Genova could write with such precision and details, yet keeping it readable for the general public.<br />  When I finished the book I just set it down with tears in my eyes and said Wow.. amazing book.<br />If you know anyone with Alzheimers I strongly recommend this book. One of the only books that The National Alzheimer's Association has endorsed. I recommend it even if you just want to have a new understanding and perspective on this disease, good chance you sometime will run into someone with it. A real chance to grasp the disease, and the person who still has to live with it. May give you a whole new respect for those suffering with this disease.
B004HO6HWK|2.0|Like comparing champagne to soda pop. The Mechanic 2011 has all the fizz but not nearly as much character as the original. The new movie is mildly entertaining but pales in comparison to the point of anemia when compared with the original version starring the all time champion of movie tough guys Charles Bronson & his co-star Jan-Michael Vincent. The new upstarts just don't have the pizazz the old pros had.

0061714372|5.0|Growing up I wondered what was it like in the life of a metal band that actually had a following.  It's a good story of where Dave drew his anger from.  What was it like being in his situations and for much of it why he did what he did.  It seems Dave searched a while for what he felt was a sense of belonging.  I personally liked his brutal honesty on Metallica, his bandmates, producers, managers, family, record companies, and drugs.  I always liked his work but now respect him more for what he has achieved while dealing with his problems.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Hunger Games was a fresh series when it first came out and books 1&2 are five stars easily. Book 3 has us wondering where she's going. I could put it down...it felt sad and without very good closure. That said, it was less fantastical and more realistic than the other two. If you dig dystopian-based settings and are going for the hot Young Adult genres that have so much more to offer than adult...this will be a great wrap-up for the series. Don't forget to read the first two books...these don't stand-alone. My teen boys LOVED this series; better than Twilight!
0316098337|4.0|I read the book fairly quickly, but would agree with the many criticisms you can read in other reviews:    The voice can get annoying. If you like listening to a 5 year old talk nonstop for hours on end, then maybe you'll be fine. If you don't like kids much to begin with, then you might want to skip this. The plus side is, Donoghue nails some of the annoying habits of kids down pretty well. The character goes from one thought to another, even though there is no connection, and easily slips into extremes. (Waiting for something lasts like 100 hours, the shirt is so tight, it feels like my head is about to pop off, etc.)    The end half of the novel is a lot less exciting, but is also an important aspect of the whole story. So while it definitely loses momentum, I agree with putting it in.    The things this child understands and doesn't understands seems pretty bizarre. Again, this is understandable given the context, but it seems a tad strange that a 5 year old would be able to follow \\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\\"    On the plus side, the author gets plus points for creativity. The novel is rather unique, and manages to be so without sounding too gimmicky.    I don't really agree with the people that completely fell in love, or couldn't put the book down, or went and hugged their children (they don't usually?) And if I rated this book on how much I personally enjoyed it, I'd give it either a 2 or 3. But from a more subjective point, this is a well-written novel and deserves credit for it's creativity and ability to make the reader question and examine their own lives.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I LOVE This show! I could go on and on about M.C. Hall and how amazing he is and how perfectly he nails the role. I could even go on about the amazing writers for the show. I could even say what a great cast that is the cast of Dexter. I don't need to because if you watch one episode, You will too Love this show and know all the great things that make this the best show that has been on in years. I can not wait to be shocked and wowed by season 6 of this very AMAZING show, called Dexter~ So original and entertaining !!!
B0036D7Y20|5.0|Rudolf Kempe was a great Wagner and Strauss conductor, and it is great to have his Lohengrin on remastered CD with this great cast.  In fact, this recording represents the collaboration of an historic dream team of the 60s and early 70s.<br /><br />Although there are some excellent newer digital recordings with stellar artists, such as Solti's with Placido Domingo and Jessye Norman, and Abbado's with Siegfried Jerusalem and Cheryl Studer, this recording has many unique strengths which make it very desirable.  I am very familiar with the Solti and Kempe recordings, both.  I am less familiar with Abbado's - having heard it only once.<br /><br />The Evil Ortrud and Friedrich<br />In particular, under Kempe, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Christa Ludwig, as the evil Friedrich and Ortrud, are absolutely incomparably superb in their characterizations of the conniving, malevolent couple.  Others are \\"good\\", but no one comes even close to their portrayals, they are definitive.  This recording would be important for that reason alone, but there are many other delights.<br /><br />Vulnerable Elsa<br />Elizabeth Grummer is ideal as the sweet and insecure Elsa.  Jessye Norman, who is Elsa on Solti's excellent recording, sounds wonderful, but her voice and personification are too big for the character.  Grummer wonderfully conveys Elsa's vulnerability and self-doubt. This is a definitive Elsa.<br /><br />Heroic Lohengrin<br />Jess Thomas, the American heldentenor, as Lohengrin was in great demand in live performances of the 60s.  He lives the part, and is very characterful in pointing his words and conveying heroic strength and emotion.  But he was also known for a heldentenor tendency to \\"barking\\".  Nonetheless, Thomas gives one of his more commanding performances under Kempe in this recording.  His rendition of \\"In Fernem Land\\" is particularly exciting.  His main competition comes from Placido Domingo on the Solti recording, or Siegfried Jerusalem under Abbado.  To my ear, Jerusalem has the same \\"barking\\" issues as Thomas.  Domingo, however, is a revelation on the Solti recording.  Although his accent comes through the German, his Lohengrin soars heroically, no barking or strain.  It is a beautiful performance above all others. Still, there are moments where Thomas is preferable, as in \\"in Fernam Land\\", where he may not sound as beautiful as Domingo, but he nails the heroism better.<br /><br />Conductors & Orchestras<br />As far as conductor competition, Solti represents another conductor internationally known for decades of superior Wagner/Strauss interpretations.  Abbado may not be as well known for that, but they both conduct the same orchestra as Kempe- the Vienna Philharmonic.  Solti and Abbado have modern digital sound, which means we hear everything at every dynamic.  The Vienna Philharmonic are excellent on all counts. The brass especially pull out the stops for Solti.  That recording always quickens my pulse in the Act 3 scene change with the brass players double- and triple-tonguing.  Kempe was known for his flexibility in shaping phrases and building climaxes.  I think in many places (the second scene of Act 3 as I mentioned and in Act 2 particularly)  Solti does him one better, but Kempe captures the human drama of Lohengrin, and it is very gripping in his hands.<br /><br />I highly recommend this remastered Kempe recording of Lohengrin by a great team.  Although the recording is nearly 40 years old, the sound is very good, and it has many special qualities and provides some incredible unique Wagnerian operatic moments.<br /><br />I also think the Solti recording is very special.  I couldn't make up my mind between them, so I bought them both!<br /><br />You should too!alem has the same \\"barking\\" issues as Thomas.  Domingo, however, is a revelation on the Solti recording.

The only problem that we noticed is that the volume of the \\"vocals\\" were dimmed by the volume of the instrumental music. It's like the mikes weren't working well or something.   Don't know if it's a problem with the DVD taping or our sound system.
0547258305|3.0|Let me start by saying I liked the book enough to purchase Fire and will most likely follow this author for a time.  The one MAJOR concern I had with Changeling is the animal abuse. King Leck cuts animals with knives.  Is this really an image or an act that young adult readers need to be exposed to and or/entertain?    I run a non-profit animal welfare organization and am faced with the reality of animal cruelty in our world day in and day out. Most abusers started as children. Their acts are horrific and not unlike what are described in this book.  The book was so enjoyable and I would have easily given it 5 stars but as a concerned \\"human\\" I believe we all have to take responsibility for the children of this world and what they are exposed to.  And it would sure be great if we could teach animal compassion, care and respect at the same time. There's no better medium for this than what our children read.
1600242405|5.0|Beautifully read by Johnny Depp, (although I really could listen to him reading a car manual and still find it interesting) and extremely funny excapades and insights of Keith Richards weird and wonderful life, really a one of a kind.

I bought a Kindle because I was running out of bookcases:)  Although I wanted this book, I am refusing to purchase it at the present price.  Like everyone else, I cannot understand how the Kindle version can be more expensive than the hardbound version.  I enjoy my Kindle and hope that publishers will come to their senses with regard to e-book pricing.
B003ZHVJFA|3.0|The story is weak, and quiet similar to most of the movies, not original. Characters are okay. I could say it was more or less exciting to watch some of them fight. At the start I would give it 1 star, but then as I continued to watch, in the end I decided that it was okay. If there ever will be Tekken 2, it must be nothing like this movie. I wouldn't call it boring, but it was nothing special. The movie is okay to watch, if there is nothing else to choose from.

0316069353|5.0|Mickey Haller has always played it a little to the left of respectability and liked it there.  He learned how to play the game well from his late father reputed to be the greatest lawyer ever to hit the legal system.  Mickey is a great guy, wonderful father and not to bad ex-husband, but with the legal system it is all about the check mark in the win column and how you get there is not the issue but the answer.  But when you are faced with doing something that even crosses your line what are you going to do?<br /><br />Now that times are a little rough economically Mickey is dealing with the lucrative foreclosure market.  This new avenue to obtain clients is paying well and still lets him keep his office in the back of his Lincoln, traveling around from one court house to another kicking legal butt.  But when one of his foreclosure clients is accused of killing the banker who is about to kick her out of her house Mickey get back in full lawyer mode and takes this one head on.  Mickey never asks if his client did the deed he just asks \\"can you cover my retainer and do you have a credit card that can handle the monthly charge\\"?<br /><br />But this client is setting off even Mickey's sense of something is not right when the pieces of the crime too perfectly don't fit the client or her ability to have murdered the banker.  When she makes bail and shows up with her movie producer the situation goes from bad to ridiculous with Mickey indignant and threatening breach of contract.  But this time perhaps Mickey took on something he can't handle and finds out quickly someone does not like his courtroom tactics and he winds up in the hospital after a brutal attack.  This may be a murder case, but it is definitely one that appears be a guilty client committing the perfect crime he just can't figure out how.<br /><br />Michael Connelly consistently knows how to write a great mystery with characters that show up and get the job done with every book.  The stories are always current with a twist of what is going on in the world around us and they never stop surprising me with their depth and ability to follow the leads through regardless of where they take them.  I thought The Lincoln Lawyer was going to be Mickey Haller's best story written but this one showed me how wrong I am.

0143035711|5.0|Clearly this book has been a primary source for the Vietnam war experience. Passages in Mason's book have been brought to life in film, television, and emulated in other books I have read. It is also required reading for any soldier or civilian who pilots a helicopter (a neighbor of mine in the Canadian military who is a helicopter pilot was the first to alert me to the book). The imagery and situations he paints are stark and often surreal from landmines leftover from the French conflict to the Vietnamese interpreter who could not speak English to washing out the blood from the helicopters at the end of the day. Also his chance meeting with Westmoreland and the anger over comrade's defilement are incredible. Mason's recall, his love of flying, enviable service record, and startling downfall in civilian life make Chickenhawk a compelling read.
B004L49K20|5.0|I totally love this album.  I purchased the 9 song from itunes and now have purchased the CD.  The original 9 songs have been on an almost constant repeat in the car and now it's the CD.  It is awesome driving music.  Heck it's awesome music. This could have been the follow up to Rio, but it manages to sound both retro and current which is not an easy task. Simon's voice is amazing as always, Nick's synths are as brilliant as ever and the driving bass from John Taylor moves everything along.  I can't really say anthing negative about any of the tracks.  They all have their good qualities and fit together seamlessly for listening to the entire album, but here is a rundown of some of my favorites<br /><br />All you Need is Now. It scared me a bit before the album came out because I found the verses a bit stilted although the chorus is pure Duran magic.  This track has grown on me and although it still feels to me like two different songs glued together, it has some awesome synths from Nick and a confident vocal from Simon<br /><br />Blame the Machines. John Taylor's driving bass line kicks this one into high gear.  Love it.<br /><br />Leave a Light On.  This reminds me a lot of Save a Prayer.  Same tempo and feel.<br /><br />Safe (in the heat of the moment)  This is a turn it up barn burner with help from Ana Matronic of the Scissor Sisters.  I love this track<br /><br />Girl Panic! would have been a huge hit for the band in their heyday.  This is a sing along stormer with a classic Duranie feel and sound.<br /><br />Man who Stole a Leopard.  Probably the best track on the album, it is 6+ minutes of pure pop perfection.  Simon with vocal assistance from Kelis and Ninna Hossain nails this one.  The harmonies are sublime and the instrumentation and production is on a par with anything I have ever heard<br /><br />Mediterranea is a lilting song with a bit of a tropical hanging out on the beach vibe<br /><br />Before the Rain also has a classic Duran Duran sound and is a great way to end a terrific album<br /><br />The other tracks on this album are by no means filler, even the \\"tracks\\" that are really short instrumental breaks based on the title track, have their place<br /><br />I skip nothing when I play this one and frequently listen straight through 2 or 3 times.  About every other day it finds it's way back to the player.  Thank you Duran Duran for one of the best albums of the year.bum are by no means filler, even the \\"tracks\\" that are really short instrumental breaks based on the title track, have their place    I skip nothing when I play this one and frequently listen straight through 2 or 3 times.

B002ZG97RE|1.0|To put it plainly.  The title of my review says it all.  If you hold any American patriotism within your hearts and believe our governments goal is not to betray and use its American citizens, then this movie is not for you.<br /><br />The plot is merely this:<br />Following the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller and his men are charged with finding the so-called weapons of mass destruction, whose existence justified American involvement, according to the Pentagon and their man in Baghdad, Poundstone. Veteran CIA operative Marty tells Miller that there are no weapons, it is a deception to allow the Americans to take over the country and install a puppet leader. Also suspicious of Poundstone is Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne, who lets slip to Miller that Poundstone told her he had secret talks in Jordan with an important Iraqi, code-named Magellan, who told him about the weapons, though it now seems likely Magellan's true information was to the contrary. So begins a hunt for the truth.<br /><br />However, the movie has a disappointing ending and in my opinion, as a true conservative-American citizen and one who believes in the \\"fight for freedom,\\" this movie left me angry and emotionally fatigued.  I am bewildered in believing there really are people in this country who believe the way this movie portrays American's to be.
B0000549B0|5.0|A classic,fun movie based on the broadway play that shows that there are things beyond the normal, and that those that acknowledge them are not mentally ill.  In fact they may be better people than \\"normal\\" people.
1439196834|2.0|This book was funny, but there's just nothing too it. I read the whole thing in one sitting, and not a long one at that. Bathroom reading material maybe?
B000002P2W|3.0|I love the Who, but there are two of their UK releases I rarely listen to, and this is one of them. It's an album of unrelated songs with a minimalist approach that deals primarily with darker issues, like growing old, insecurity with super-stardom, struggles with sensuality and substance abuse, so unless you're in a cerebral mood when listening to this record, this album - even by the Who's own standards - isn't much of a rocker... However, it doesn't need to be; I found \\"Imagine a Man\\" one of my all-time favorite Who \\"numbers\\", and \\"Slip Kid\\" is right up there with the best of them. However, just like their first hit \\"I Can't Explain\\" was heavily influenced by the Kinks, \\"Squeeze Box\\" sounds like a Jagger/Richards tune right off a mid-'70's Stones album, making it perhaps, the least Who-sounding song in their entire catalog... I believe \\"Numbers\\" is worth having if you are a die-hard fan of the Who. Otherwise, you may want to listen to the sample clips and download just the ones you like for your iPod...
B004EC5IUW|4.0|Awesome rebuild of Evangelion. The extras were ok, I thought it would have more deleted scenes. FYI to those of you who are big on cover aesthetics or collecting, the cover is nice but it seems like the orange material used chips if mishandled (via bending, scratching).
0316069353|1.0|I will miss not reading this book since it does sound interesting but I will not buy it because pricing the e-book higher than the hardback is ridiculous.  Too bad, I like character and I like Michael Connelly but I draw the line at being gouged there are too many other books out there.
1934429376|5.0|This is a sturdy and beautiful book that makes you extremely grateful to Todd Oldham for rediscovering the artist Charley Harper. You can't look at these pictures without smiling and feeling that you live in a world full of marvelous things.
B004A8ZWTW|5.0|I thought this movie was perfectly done.  After I saw the movie I read the book, and the most poignant and poetic passages are lifted directly from the book and are breathed into glorious life in the movie.  Mia and Michael were riveting as Jane and Mr. Rochester.  I can't wait for it to be available on DVD so I can have it in house any time I need a bit of romance.

B004FPE4DK|4.0|Listening to the Irish band Villagers supporting the wonderful Elbow in their huge hometown Manchester concert the other evening I was reminded of the fine talent that continues to stream out of Ireland and in particular the ability of artists from the Emerald Isle to produce debut albums of such assuredness and maturity that they really must make others green with envy. If you have yet to hear \\"The year of the Jackal\\" you should beat a path on to Amazon post haste where you will also find \\"Early in the morning\\" from the new Dublin troubadour James Vincent McMorrow awaiting to press your aural delight buttons. A slight pause however at this point since before going into detail there is a need to address the Bon Iver issue. This is a recent phenomenon which sees mostly male artists employing a propensity to beat a retreat into some desolate rural hinterland in a hastily constructed log cabin and pour out deep melancholy in their wretchedness. McMorrow has partially done this by recording this album near the sea in a cottage somewhere off the Irish coast, that said the smell of the seaweed and the stiff Irish breeze has combined to produce songs of very sombre delight but also an underpinning soulfulness on a number of tracks which keeps the wrist slitting elements down to bare minimum. In addition to prove that he has a real sense of humour McMorrow has recently produced a truly unique cover of that highly irritating pop imp Willow Smith's ode to luxurious locks, \\"Whip My Hair\\" which can be found all over the music blogs and is undeniably great.<br /><br />\\"Early in the morning\\" has been released in the UK for well over a year but on the basis of \\"if at first you dont succeed\\" McMorrows label is giving it another shot which is commendable since this music deserves to be noticed. The album mixes a range of West Coast influenced songs like the beautiful \\"This old dark machine\\" which skips along at a fine pace and shows that McMorrow has chart ambitions. Opener \\"If I had a boat\\" does owe some debt to Justin Vernon at least in the first 30 seconds but McMorrow produces a shimmering vocal and a spare background and turns it into a special song with echoes of that old curmudgeon Van Morrison. A particular highlight is the intense \\"Down the burning ropes\\" with its almost Jeff Buckley intonations while the excellent \\"Sparrow and the wolf\\" edges into that territory currently occupied by Johnny Flynn. Possibly the best song on this album is the slowly building \\"From the woods\\" which builds to a stirring climax and shows that McMorrow is very much his own man in key compositions. A couple of tracks on here such as the title track are perhaps a bit to close to the Bon Iver ghostly register aesthetic for comfort but lets cut James Vincent McMorrow some slack since in the majority of songs on this album his muse leads him to produce some genuinely tender songs with vivid acoustic textures which makes for a fine debut.t\\" does owe some debt to Justin Vernon at least in the first 30 seconds but McMorrow produces a shimmering vocal and a spare background and turns it into a special song with echoes of that old curmudgeon Van Morrison.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|I saw this film on a plane trip, and would have gotten more satisfaction out of staring into the air sick bag.  Really, this film is as bad as it gets.    I don't know if the \\"restarting the sun\\" idea makes any sense at all, but the whole psychological component of the film and the selection of misfits sent to save the earth is beyond stupid.  While there is a science fiction spin throughout the film, most of the real storyline relates to the psychological side of the story.  The tone is vaguely reminiscent of Solaris, but without the depth and consistency (based what what I infer about the lack of originality of the director, maybe he noted that Solaris also has a \\"solar themed name\\" and figured he could copy the mood).    The key flaw is that when it comes to saving the earth, the best we, as a planet, can drum up are a bunch of navel-gazing under-informed ineffective whiners.  At least the movie is consistent: the mind-numbingly dumb screenplay is accompanied by sophomoric directing and made-for-TV acting.  Oh yeah, the special effects are not very good either!   It's been many years since I have seen a movie to thoroughly unfulfilling and worthless.
B0034G4OUO|3.0|It seems perfectly natural to assume that a movie about a convict being released from jail who goes on a vengeful killing spree is going to be dumb and painfully unoriginal. Especially when the filmmakers double down and cast Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson in the lead role.  Well color me surprised.  Faster has everything you might expect in the action/revenge genre -- a lot of guns, cool cars, shooting while driving fast in cool cars, and violent retribution enforced by a muscle-bound protagonist.<br /><br />What I wasn't expecting is how thoughtful and well-crafted the movie is.  Director George Tillman Jr. really takes the time to explore the price of revenge, the consequences of doing evil, and the possibility of redemption.  And none of it comes across as preachy or sentimental.  Moreover, the film is full of interesting characters. Johnson is excellent, exhibiting controlled rage as he methodically executes one creep after another.  He doesn't talk much, letting his eyes and facial expression tell his story.  Billy Bob Thornton plays a drug-addicted, loser cop trying to track down Johnson's character while keeping his crumbling family from falling apart.  There's an interesting villain, a hitman sent to stop the killing spree.  He's a complicated, ultra-disciplined, narcissistic adrenaline junkie with a host of psychological issues.<br /><br />The profound contrast with the blunt, single-mindedness of Johnson is entertaining. As the film nears its climax, each of these characters is forced to make a choice that determines his fate.  Solid movie all the way around.  I can't remember the last time an action movie made me sympathize (at least a little) with the guys I wanted dead.
B0034G4P7G|1.0|Found the movie disturbing until I discovered that Aaron Sorkin's screenplay adapts Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires. Ben Mezrich is notorious for distorting the truth. While the movie is entertaining it, it can hardly be taken as a credible account of what really occurred.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|i was going to buy the original godfather but i decided to buy this restored version. honestly i dont know what people are complaining about. sure if your one of those movie freaks that will sit there and watch the two versions side by side im sure there would be small differences but honestly its a great product its easier to understand what their saying the sound quality is better and so is the picture.
B000002KFJ|5.0|I am still waiting for a double cd release of this album. To me, simply their very best ever !  Sabotage is very well produced and performed. It contains some of the heaviest songs ever put on tape by the band !!
B002HREKCI|3.0|I chose this book because I read that Selena Gomez has signed on to play the female lead in the movie. That suggests teens will be paying attention to the movie when it comes out, and I'm a professional public speaker who is adding \\"teen suicide\\" to my menu of topics.     Hanna Baker could certainly have used some adults in her life playing an active role. But like so many youth-centered stories, movies and television shows, she and her peers seem to be living life in a world completely populated by teens raising themselves.     Is that how it is now? Both parents working all hours and no one supervising or conversing with their kids? Of course, if you are a teen reading this book, this description may be your favorite part. But even if these kids were raised by wolves, you would expect to find a mama wolf around. These teens are free to slip out the bedroom windows at all hours, undetected, attending frequent teen beer parties blaring for blocks around. But are there no cops to break up parties? And no one has a word with parents? Don't police still haul drunken minors in and call parents to \\"come get your intoxicated child at the police station.\\"    \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" is still a reasonable choice to read. At 250 pages it is a quick enough read even for a slow reader like myself. My hesitation is that, with my apology to the author Jay Asher, the story doesn't seem compelling enough to me. I was only moderately interested in the characters. Maybe that's because I was reading with a purpose - to see how he wove the suicide warning signs into the story, to learn how the people in Hanna Baker's life could have stepped in to avoid her tragic decision. Like most stories - real life and fiction, there weren't enough others who strongly stepped in to prevent a bad decision from becoming fact.     Is there enough to the story to create conversation between teens and others? Absolutely, yes. That for me may be the novel's best feature - and the main reason I recommend it.    Steve Stewart
B0039SFKSW|5.0|All songs on this album are good and very well produced and played. The album opens with a winner \\"Finger on the Trigger\\" and closes with another winner song \\"Don't Wanna Lose You Now\\"<br />The second song,\\"Through My Veins\\" is classic ASIA and the third one \\"Holy War\\" might be their very best song ever. Masterfuly played, the song should be a instant classic, Carl Palmer does his best work here, playin in similar style to Keith Moon s'. The interplay between the guitar and organ is fantastic !<br /><br />Ever Yours is a ballad in the best John Wetton/Asia tradition.<br /><br />\\"End of the World\\" follows and the rest of the album maintain a quality level hard to find these days. The US version differs from the Japanese in that, the later excludes \\"Emily\\" a novelty song and a joke. To me, this might by far, ASIA 's best ever album !!
B004UNB1R4|4.0|The Band has always been one of my favorite bands, so it was a pleasure to see this new album from Robbie Robertson being offered as the MP3 Daily Deal on April 5, 2011.<br /><br />This is a strong, bluesy rock album that also runs through some softer material pretty well. Production values are very good.<br /><br />The vocals create a smoky, clubby atmosphere -- Robertson whispers, growls and speaks, but never really sings in full voice. Not sure if he has lost his voice to cigarettes over the years, or just made a stylistic decision. Whichever it is, it works pretty well.<br /><br />A few tracks that stood out:<br />- \\"When the Night Was Young\\" is a laid back blues featuring great harmonies from a female vocalist.<br />- The same can be said of \\"This is Where I Get Off\\", one of my favorites on the album.<br />- Eric Clapton makes a guest guitar and vocal appearance on \\"Fear of Falling\\", which has a different feel from the rest of the record and is pretty good.<br />- I enjoyed the instrumental track \\"Madame X\\", which basically riffs off the preceding song, \\"She's Not Mine\\", with acoustic instrumentation and a differnt feel.<br />- The title track \\"How to Become Clairvoyant\\" is a strange one, with nice guitar work. The lyrics kind of recall the Police's old hit \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\", with classical occult references and a general theme of learning witchcrafty-type skills.<br />- Apart from \\"When the Night Was Young\\", my favorite is probably the last track, \\"Tango for Django\\". Somebody should put this in a movie score. A visually evocative atmosphere with strings playing -- sounds like violas and cellos.<br /><br />I was debating on whether this album is 4 or 5 stars. I'd give it 4.5 if I could. Amazon's official guidance is 4 stars = \\"I like it\\" and 5 = \\"I love it\\". Well, I really liked it. A strong record, well worth hearing.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Why this series was axed after the first season I will never know!  It is indicative of Joss Whedon's brilliant mind with a great story and really interesting characters.  It's nice to be able to watch something a bit different.

030758660X|4.0|This is a gorgeous book -- I admit I was drawn in by the cover, since there is a redhead (like me!) wearing purple (my favorite color!) and -- oh yes, it just happens to be called Vampire Knits.  Now, i don't know a thing about the popular Twilight series, but I love my 19th/early 20s century literary vampires, and I love vampire movies of the 60s and 70s (and everything before that too) and I can easily imagine \\"my\\" kind of vampires in the context of these lovely creations.  The only problem with the book is that it has a lot of mistakes in it, some of them quite frustrating.  For example, the Lore Hoodie that graces the cover of the book says it takes #4, worsted weight, yarn, in the description, but it calls for a yarn that is much heavier.  The corrections on the publisher's page update it to #5, bulky weight, though the yarn called for (Berroco Peruvia Quick) is listed as super-bulky over on Ravelry.  So, if you didn't go to check all the possible errata before starting your project, you could find yourself quite frustrated if you choose to use something other than Peruvia Quick.<br /><br />Aside from the odd typo though it is beautifully photographed, the patterns have lovely descriptions and there are amusing tidbits about vampires on many pages.  I immediately made the Black Veil scarf in the recommended yarn (Patons Silk Bamboo) and it was a thoroughly delightful experience, with beautiful results.  I also have the materials to make the Countess Bathory scarf, I started the Sidhe Shrug and am working on that hoodie as well.  There are so few knitting books on the market that have this kind of creative and unusual spin -- gothic knitting is a perfect combination to my mind.  Although I don't have a great need for the bulkier winter items in here, they are attractive too, and the choice of yarns is appealing.  I love that there are a lot of lace patterns in these projects because lace knitting is where my interests lie at the moment.  But they are fairly simple and straightforward, and shouldn't present a problem to those who are not used to lace.  There is something in this book for every skill level, so the casual knitter could easily start with a simple scarf and work their way through the different projects to gain quite a lot of experience.
0385528752|5.0|Switch, by Chip and Dan Heath, is a fascinating look at how change happens, whether on the level of individuals, businesses, or whole societies. To motivate change, in short, you have to do one or more of three things: \\"direct the rider,\\" that is, appeal to the rational part of the people whom you want to change; \\"motivate the elephant,\\" or engage people emotionally; and \\"shape the path,\\" that is, make changes to the environment that make changing easier and not changing more difficult. That's it, but the authors go on to explain various means of accomplishing each of these, and they punctuate the book with stories of real-life changes and how they were accomplished. This isn't exactly a how-to book, but it does provide a lot of advice that can be applied to one's own life (the importance of removing ambiguity from one's directives, for example, and creating \\"action triggers\\" when attempting to create a habit). Some of the information provided may not be a surprise to readers: you'll probably have heard that the size of your plate or your popcorn bucket can influence how much you'll eat. Even so, you'll probably be surprised at how much of an influence portion size can have, and at some of the other real-life behavior discussed in the book.<br /><br />In addition to being a very interesting read, Switch is also written in exceptionally clear prose. It would make valuable reading for anyone who's looking to create change, whether you're interested in altering the way your company does business or getting your kids to clean their rooms.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm a 42 y.o female.  While at my office about 3 weeks ago, a song came on the radio that stopped me in my tracks. I got out of my chair, went to check the radio station and immediately did an internet search to find out what this heavenly voice was.  It was Adele singing \\"Rolling in the Deep\\".  That night I went home and ordered this cd.      I have to say that for such a young woman, she absolutely moves me. She wrote every song on this record at the age of 21 and that by itself is quite impressive.  And her voice - all I can say is WOW.  I particulary enjoy \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" and \\"He Won't Go\\".   By the time you get to the end of the CD and listen to \\"Someone like You\\", you'd better be prepared with a box of tissue.  Check YouTube for her live performance of the song at the Brit Awards and don't say I didn't warn you.     Needless to say, after listening to this record several times my hubby and I are instant fans.  Some artists of today have to dress up in crazy costumes & makeup and pop out of an egg to be relevant & attract attention.  Thank God Adele is the real thing, just pure and natural talent.  I'm so happy I discovered her.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|What in the heck is up with the Kindle pricing of this book?  I bought a Kindle to be \\"green\\".  There is not cost with printing and binding an e-book yet we are taking it up the shorts.  WHY!!!  I am going to protest and not read this book.  Sad, as I have read all the other books but this seriously bites.

His commentary on putting his theories to practice (and Jason Sweig's updated information in footnotes and end chapter commentary) prove how intelligent Benjamin Graham was, and how relevant his advice is to not chase quick riches through speculation, and to instead become an intelligent investor.

0394818237|3.0|I have a record with the original reading of this book by Carol Channing for those of you who remember her.  I was reading this book with my 3 and 4 year old to the old record and after about 5 stories the record stopped matching the book.  I then discovered it was abridged.  I was pretty upset.  I will be sending the book back and looking for an unabridged version.  I wish the publisher would provide an unabridged version for us Huckle-lovers.  I gave it a three star because of how much it was abridged.  They didn't abridge the text of the stories but deleted whole stories on a wholesale scale.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|It's not too often that I buy music anymore (not saying I pirate it, I just simply don't acquire music much anymore, just listen to what I want on pandora or grooveshark), but I had to purchase this. Perhaps it's because I have a weakness for banjos, but the first time I heard \\"Little Lion Man\\", I knew I had to buy the whole album. And it was certainly worth it. The rest of the songs are just as strong, musically as well as lyrically. If you're wondering if you should buy this, the answer is yes, you should.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter just keeps getting better and better. Love the characters! I've enjoyed every season, but this is my favorite -- very sad but very good.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This is one of my all-time favourite movies. It is funny at times and sad at times. Elijah Wood is great as the slightly strange collector, Jonathan, but even greater is Eugene Hutz as Alex the tour guide translator. Alex speaks english as if through some sort of thesaurus dictionary combination. When he wants to describe something as \\"hard\\" (difficult), he says it is \\"rigid\\" which does mean \\"hard\\" but not \\"difficult\\". He does this with many words, to the great amusement of the viewer. This may be my favourite thing about the movie because I so greatly enjoy playing with language in fun ways.<br />The whole story is great as well and handled really well in my opinion. There are a lot of great images. All of the actors played really well, and really well together too.<br />I highly recommend it.<br />I do not however, recommend the book it was adapted from (sadly), but that is a different review.
B001LF347E|5.0|I just love this show! It is the best. There is humour, magic, adventure and action!! The writers should be complimented on creating a young Merlin for viewers. The actor who portrays Merlin is extremely fun to watch on screen. He's adorable! Young Arthur, Morgana, Gaius, and King Uther are equally enjoyable to watch. Sorry to see Morgana become so evil, but it makes for good viewing. I hope this show goes on for a long time! It's one of my absolute favorites.
0525422943|4.0|In Gayle Forman's [[ASIN:0525422943 Where She Went]], Mia and Adam are now living separate lives. Mia broke off things shortly after going to Julliard, and Adam has spent the past three years trying to work through his confusion and hurt. In the meantime, Adam's band has become an international phenomenon, and Mia has become the cello virtuoso of her generation. In a chance encounter, Adam and Mia meet in New York City right before both are about to leave on world tours. In one night, the two must struggle to overcome years of pain and misunderstanding to see if any love remains.<br /><br />Similar to the first book, WHERE SHE WENT packs an emotional punch with its direct, affecting prose, and the use of Adam as the first-person narrator in this installment adds emotional insight. This book provides an unflinching look at how tragedy can impact people differently, and this sequel shows characters that are more flawed and complicated. While Forman's prose is unfettered, her attention to detail about the small things that bind people draws the reader in. The parallelism in structure between the first and the second book is also outstanding. Flashbacks are used deftly to describe what has happened in the past three years, and the older age of the characters allows for deeper, more realistic reflection. Beautiful and telling song lyrics are incorporated as chapter headings, and this was the first time I've read a book in which I felt that the lyrics really added to the story.<br /><br />Early in my reading, I felt that I was going to like WHERE SHE WENT even better than [[ASIN:B004R96SPQ If I Stay]], but it didn't have the same emotional impact ultimately. I was less able to connect to the characters this time because they had each become celebrities in their own ways, and there were a few times that Adam's inner dialogue didn't ring true or when conversations between he and Mia felt awkwardly worded. Though the ending will please many, it felt predictable and too easily resolved for me. Also, there were a few mishaps that jumped out, like inaccuracies regarding what strings a cello has.<br /><br />Overall though, WHERE SHE WENT provides an emotionally impactful conclusion to the story of Adam and Mia and what happens to people after they continue to live in the wake of tragedy. I recommend this book heartily to anyone who loved IF I STAY or to those who embrace books with harsh emotional realities that end with a bit of hope.<br /><br />Note: This review refers to an advance reader's copy.me.

B003PIUBZS|4.0|I enjoy watching this show. It's a bit on the dirty side, nudity wise, than what I'm used to watching. But then again, the Romans weren't a chaste people. The violence is to be expected since it is about gladiators after all. Look forward to see what the writers will do with the story when the main actor is well enough to continue. We all know Spartacus is supposedly killed, but the body was never recovered. So will the writers make him secretly escape, or let it remain a mystery? Considering how disgusting the Romans are and how they treat their slaves, the viewer can only hope that some of the slaves escape the perversity and enjoy some portion of their lives.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I just want to say I loved this movie, I love everything about it, the story behind the musical, the songs, the performance, the dancing, the costumes everything, but must of all the first act of Cher singing \\"Welcome to Burlesque\\" was marvelous, She is the best!! Christina is exceptional too, so I don't know what some people were expecting from this movie that they did not found, but for me is one of the best musical I ever see and I will see over and over again!!!

0312330529|5.0|\\"Shantaram\\" is a cross between \\"A Fine Balance\\", \\"The Kite Runner\\", \\"A Million Little Pieces\\", and \\"The Godfather\\" if you can believe that.  Not wanting to spoil any details, the book chronicles the journey of a heroine addict, who escapes from an Australian prison and finds himself in India.  While it is a daunting 900+ pages, the author's love affair with India, is breathtaking.  I started reading this book years ago, and although I adored it, I put it down halfway through.  When I finally came back to it, it was with renewed vigor. I have spent the last two years reading nothing but the \\"classics\\", and cannot help but think this is the only book I have read from the modern era that I can comfortably say, will be a classic piece of literature for generations to follow...it is honestly that good!

B001TKD4ZI|5.0|How to marry a millionaire vampire was by far my favorite book in in the love at stake series. Not only is Roman a hunk but he is also a genius. The creator of synthic blood and coven master of America he is everything a vampire strives to be. But because of his dark past he finds it hard to accept his immortal status. Then as fate would have it one bite into a sex toy and Roman is fang free he needs a dentist. Enter Shanna. She is smart mouthed, loveable, and on the run from the Russian mob. Thankful she finds a savior in Roman who showed up to fix his fang. They have an instant attraction and Roman refuses to leave Shanna to the sharks so Shanna stays at Roman's townhouse with his Scottish guards and harem! Though he claims he is not interested in 11 beautiful women. This book is amazing I couldn't put it down with its humor and steamy sences. So buy this book and heat up a bottle of blood because you will not be able to stop once you've started reading about Shanna and Roman's adventure!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works wonderfully on both my HTC Droid Incredible and Motorola Xoom. Highly recommend. This one is more graphically appealing than original and seasons. People complainng about the application store in reviews for this (twice free now) game, wrong place. Issues with Amazon aren't issues with this application.  If you have issues with the DRM tied into staying signed into Amazon, get off and move on. Both of my devices are signed into a ton of accounts at all times, and I have trusted Amazon for a long time. First ordering random stuff. Now cloud storage, music, video on demand, and mobile applications... and ordering random stuff.
0847835073|5.0|Purchasing on the internet can be a slippery slope. Often, unless you deal with the traditional stores such as Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and Borders to purchase a book, the shipping charge is huge, the customer service is impersonal, and delivery can be a hassle.    Starting in February I searched far and wide to purchase Monica Bellucci's Photo Book. My search started with several calls to Barnes and Noble. They told me that this book was a special order. I decided to place my order with them online. The Book, according to them was on back order. They kept telling me that they ordered it, and were waiting for it to arrive. This went on for 5 weeks. After their final window had expired I called their head office in NYC and they again assured me that the book was on order. I told them I would wait one more week. It never came and they still had the book available on their site. Finally they told me in an e-mail after I canceled my order that they could not get the book. This was more than 6 weeks, after me doing all of the leg work. Needless to say, this was quite frustrating.    During the time I was waiting I searched all over the internet to purchase the book at a reasonable price, not the crazy price from Ebay dealers or some of the Amazon market place dealers who bought several copies of the book when it first came out, and are now selling it at 400 to 500 percent of the actual value of the book. Normally I am all for free market capitalism, however it was Monica's initial desire when she agreed to do the book was that the proceeds would be donated to a couple of charities she picked. The initial printing of the book was by Rizzoli in Italy, in Italian. Limited copies were produced for the English market, but being that I am a purist, and the fact that this is mainly a photographic book. I wanted the Original Italian language book. I honestly was not willing to pay $300 for a book that retailed for 50 Euros ($60 US) at the time.    I saw on Amazon, a market place seller called Deastore that had the book for $72.95. I did some research on the internet and realized they are a huge online outlet. Read some of the comments about them and decided to make a purchase. Special thanks to Amazon for offering this great service!    To be honest this Deastore was perhaps one of the best purchases I have ever made on the internet. I was contacted as soon as I made the order, as soon as the order shipped which was only 2 business days later. I had several questions regarding the order and not only did they answer them all, they were so polite and respectful.    Although the book took awhile to arrive because Amazon had only the ground shipping option they were very reassuring and continued contact with me. The kind folks at Deastore, were excellent. The 5 pound package arrived, in perfect condition. There was a professional invoice, including their address and phone number in the package, and a very nice gesture of a 15 percent off coupon good until the end of the year on any item in their vast library!    All I can say it Graze Mille!    Buy from these folks!    As far as the book goes, it is awesome, especially for any photography buff like myself. It is 250 pages of various photos scattered all throughout Monica's modeling and film career. There is a artist drawing in the beginning, a forward, and a note from Monica in the front few pages. The paper it is printed on is very high quality and the book has the quality of an archival volume.    I like how the photographers are named as the pictures are taken, and there a a few fold out pages as well. A full location, photographer, and page listing is found at the end of the book. Excellent all the way around. This is a must purchase book for any photography or Monica Bellucci fan.

0756404738|5.0|It's a seductive read...you keep reading, and reading, and reading.  The slow pace, coupled with some wonderful writing, is very satisfying.    We learn more about Kvothe as he learns more about parts of his world away from the University, though we don't learn much more about the Chadrian.  There's the mystery of the Cthaeh, and the locked box that Kvothe can no longer open.   What book three will bring, I have no idea, but faith in the author, and hope I'm still around to read it.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Im going to keep this short and to the point. I loved how this movie looked in IMAX and when i got the blue=-ray i was expected the quality to look not so great as it did in IMAX, but boy was i wrong. The blu-ray version looks beautiful just like it did in IMAX and the bonus features are good enough for me to keep replaying it. Hope you all enjoy this film as I have.    P.S. you just have to enter what is written on the screen ;)

B001ILFUDC|5.0|The DVD Pinocchio is utilized by one of our teachers to teach the logic of conscience to the youngest class of children at our Church.  The question of right and wrong decisions which will face each one is protrayed by Jiminy Cricket and while the children are learning to select proper values in life, they are entertained by the visual story of Pinocchio, who did not do so well in his selections.  Not only is this children's story entertaining to this age group, it is a wonderful teaching aid. Life's values from a Christian view-point is essential to produce well balanced human beings in our society.
1400052181|5.0|As I began reading this book, I was taken by the force of the emotion expressed throughout. The book is well written and although it is technical it is easy to read. It will move you from page one until the end.<br />There is an implication in the book, that Henrietta, quite possibly, got substandard care because she was black. Their treatment often began later, medication was scarcer and black patients would not question white doctors who frequently treated them inequitably, in less than equal facilities. The alternate reason for her lack of diagnosis and, perhaps, improper treatment, is that those were the days when patients were kept from knowing the truth of their diagnosis because it was too frightening for them to handle. Yet, although there is evidence that she repeatedly complained, no cancer diagnosis was made until it was, abruptly, way too late and she died a painful, premature death, at 31.<br />The despicable act of experimenting on humans, without their consent, was common practice even as late as the fifties, especially, it seems, in the black population. Doctors who thought of themselves as G-dlike, believing the results of their research ultimately justified the means they used, duped their ill patients, without warning or advising them, of what they planned. They were experimental subjects and had no clue.<br />The author's research takes her to the landscape of Henrietta's life. At first, she was received by the family with skepticism, but in the end, they were very accepting of her effort to tell the world about their mother.  The family had been abused by the medical profession. They were kept in the dark about their mother's illness and their lack of education kept them ignorant of the facts they needed to discover what had really happened. Had they understood, they quite possibly could have fought for an equitable distribution of profits, before the Statute of Limitations ran out. Sadly, while Henrietta'a cells afforded others, who had the means, innovative treatments, her own family could not afford anything but the most basic health care.<br />It is hard to read about the poverty of the Lacks' existence and reconcile it with the wealth of information her cells have provided and the financial wealth, as well, that her cells have provided for those who used them to advance their research. Although they had so few creature comforts, no education and substandard health care, they had great faith and lived their lives supporting each other in life's unspeakably cruel arena. Most were proud that their mom's cells were able to advance medicine and save lives. They only wished it might have also been used to save their own.<br />This is a sad book with tragic circumstances but the characters are real and so the impact of the story is profound. Life knocks them down and they keep getting up, trying to rise above the scars caused by the vast deprivation and evil around them and somehow they manage to face life in a simple spiritual way, with an ability to forgive. The component of faith, makes this book's ultimate message, more beautiful.<br />As an aside, at one point in the story, Rebecca more or less tells Deborah that if her book is published she will start a fund for the education of Henrietta's heirs. I wonder if she kept her promise or if she, like others, simply used the Lacks family to advance themselves and their projects.ve treatments, her own family could not afford anything but the most basic health care.

B001EN71CW|5.0|At first glance, Firefly might just seem like a rather unique idea for a scifi show in space. While I would love to go in depth as to the elements of the story and world that Firefly occupies and why they are superb, that would be spoiling the fun. Suffice it to say, the back stories for every character (Captain Reynolds especially), the way in which the world is slowly shown to you, and the story in general are miles above the mediocrity that is modern TV writing.  But that is not even the best part...    The characters and the way the characters interact are so well done that you can really start to see the relationships between them. This show has the best written dialogue I have ever seen (well technically heard...).  All in all, this is my favorite TV show of all time.    Also looks awesome in 1080p, really brings out all the details.
0307463745|4.0|I like this book.  Although it doesn't give you a map to success, it reminds you to separate the wheat from the chaff.  It reminds you to keep it simple, and is an easy read.
0316069353|1.0|Everything previously said regarding the inflated pricing is \\"spot on\\".  Just because you own the platform and distribute the content doesn't license you to \\"steal\\".  In fact you have a greater responsibility to support authors by making their work available at an affordable price.  You obviously have learned nothing from the music industry.  Your 'young turk' attitude and 'gorilla' pricing will destroy not only your base but seriously hurt the author.

B004M20YDU|3.0|It was only inevitable that Daft Punk's inspirational soundtrack to [[ASIN:B0037KMHRY Tron Legacy]] would get commercially remixed by some of the most \\"recognized\\" DJ's around the globe.  As much as I was looking forward to this album though, it's somewhat of a mixed bag.  Some of the tracks are pretty good and worth listening to, maybe two or three mixes that I would consider to be exceptional, the rest sound very little like they were inspired by DP's music from Tron Legacy and I'd rather some of the better R3J3CT3D mixes by artists like Junkie XL, Groove, Dekoi and Tame Impala (found only on the Australian release of R3CONF1GUR3D replacing Photek's mix) would have been included on this album instead.  Whoever produced this didn't really select the best demos and more often than not I would rather just listen to Daft Punk's soundtrack because it is simply perfect the way it is.  I think the only artists who could have taken DP's score and made a really mind-blowing remix album would have been DP themselves and it's baffling why they didn't because this would have been the perfect opportunity for them to do so.  Sigh...<br /><br />Derezzed (The Glitch Mob Remix) - Not too bad but compared to DP's masterful mix from the film it's just average.<br /><br />Fall (M83 Vs. Big Black Delta Mix) -  This one gets my vote for worst track on the album.  The soprano \\"Na-na-naa\\" vocals are intrusive and annoying playing over the pounding percussion of Fall.  Whoever thought it was a good idea to include this one deserves to be subjected to immediate derezolution.  In fact, I'm \\"derezzing\\" it off my playlist.  Gone.<br /><br />The Grid (Crystal Method Remix) - The pioneers of commercial techno-pop Crystal Meth turn in their anticipated mix, but the result is only so-so.  I expected something much more inspired from the gurus of electronic mix groove.  Serviceable but just not as awesome as it could have been.<br /><br />Adagio For Tron (Teddybears Remix) - Good downtempo mix that maintains the melancholic melody of DP's adagio with a discotheque beat.<br /><br />The Son Of Flynn (Ki:Theory Remix) - Good keyboard arpeggiation overlayed with Harold Faltermeyer-esque guitar riffs. If you're into 80's sounding movie soundtracks like Beverly Hills Cop and Top Gun, this one's for you.<br /><br />C.L.U. (Paul Oakenfold Remix) - Oakenfold is the go-to guy when it comes to mixing awesome ambient trance mixes with good EBM.  One of my favorites.  This one you'll be hearing getting played in the clubs.<br /><br />The Son of Flynn (Moby Remix) -  Another giant commercial DJ turns in a pretty decent mix.  Very Requiem For A Dream-esque.  I prefer Moby's SOF mix much better than Ki:Theory's mix.<br /><br />End Of Line (Boyz Noize Remix) - Pretty good mix, evocative of Giorgio Moroder in a few places.  Castor would definitely be playing this one in his club.<br /><br />Rinzler (Kaskade Remix) - I really like this one.  It was playing in my dreams the first night I listened to it.  Great loud pulse pounding bass overdubs and very trancie.  A great mix to play in the clubs.<br /><br />Encom Part 2 (Com Truise Remix) - Very little here that resembles anything from DP's cue in the film except for some of the sporadic string overdubs.  Sounds a bit dated, like late 90's techno.<br /><br />End Of Line (Photek Mix) - Another great mix for Castor's Club.  I can't decide if Iike this one better than the Boize Noize mix.  They're both pretty good.<br /><br />Arena (The Japanese Popstars Mix) - A decent trance mix.  Great looping of the Arena arpeggiators.<br /><br />Derezzed (Avicil Remix) - Meh.  Just too cheesy for me.  I'll stick with DP's, thank you. Next...<br /><br />Solar Sailor (Pretty Lights Mix) - Not a bad mix but again, to be honest, I'd rather just listen to Daft Punk's version without all of the intrusive noises and overdubs.<br /><br />Tron Legacy End Titles (Sander Kleinberg Remix) - Decent with some interesting sampling of Flynn;  \\"D-d-d-d-digitalfrontier\\" but again, I prefer DP's film version way better.<br /><br />After playing Daft Punk's epic soundtrack non-stop since it was released, it was refreshing to hear the more familiar cues from the film performed in a sometimes interesting and different configuration than what I had been accustomed to hearing, but R3CONF1GUR3D derezzes itself very quickly and not surprisingly I found myself going back to Daft Punk's album because there is just no comparison.  If you're looking to compliment your soundtrack listening experience and you are really a fan of their music and the film, you might be interested in giving this disc a spin.<br /><br />End of Line, man.since it was released, it was refreshing to hear the more familiar cues from the film performed in a sometimes interesting and different configuration than what I had been accustomed to hearing, but R3CONF1GUR3D derezzes itself very quickly and not surprisingly I found myself going back to Daft Punk's album because there is just no comparison.

B003Y5H54W|4.0|May contain plot spoilers.<br /><br />Two guys compete for the attention of a young female. The movie is a who-dun-it as we have to figure out who is the werewolf as clues lead us in opposite directions. Red Riding Hood's sister is killed by a werewolf after 20 years of peace. The villagers then go to the cave of the wolf, kill a regular wolf and think they got the werewolf. A man is killed in the attack. Now this is where the plot twists. We find out early on that Red's sister was only her half sister and the man who was killed hunting the wolf was really her father. Red is in love with Peter, the poor woodcutter who reminds me too much of Twilight's Edward. Red is supposed to marry Henry, the blacksmith who happens to be the son of the man who was killed as well as Red's sister's half-brother. Red's sister was in love with Henry, but never knew he was her half-brother, and neither did Red's daddy. Got all that? Because I sure didn't.<br /><br />Gary Oldman shows up as the professional werewolf killer with a silver sword blessed by the Pope. He conducts a &#34;witch hunt&#34; in order to flush out the werewolf. The scene I liked best was the celebration of the death of the wolf. The music could best be described as pagan rave music. It was played with ancient instruments with off setting drums. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. It was a mystery, love story, and werewolf movie wrapped into one. The major down side was the mediocre acting of Peter and Henry, the two suitors.<br /><br />No nudity. A near sex scene. No profanity as I recall, tween friendly.
0345522478|4.0|It took some time for me to get into this story of the last living (and nearly immortal) Druid, Atticus O'Sullivan. It's setting (Tempe, AZ) and tone were much more grounded in reality than I'd come to expect from Urban Fantasies, and sometimes the Gaelic names were hard to keep up with (though I'm sort of used to that from reading Dostoyevsky). However, by the end, I felt as though I'd bonded with Atticus and his canine pal, Oberon, and can say without a doubt that I enjoyed this book.<br /><br />The plot summary: Atticus O'Sullivan appears to be a normal twenty-one-year-old guy, but he's really 2,000 years old and the last of his Druidic kind. He's spent almost as long running from a god whose magical sword Atticus stole during a battle. Along with Oberon, his Irish Wolf Hound, with whom he has a telepathic connection, Atticus has carved out a niche for himself in Tempe, far from the fae world who seek him. He owns a new age book store, owns a small home, and basically enjoys life.<br /><br />Then he's visited by the Morrigan, a goddess of death, who warns him about an impending fight that could lead to trouble for Atticus. When, shortly after that, an encounter with another goddess leads to trouble for Oberon, Atticus finds himself in the middle of a crisis of other-worldly proportions.<br /><br />Kevin Hearne is an excellent author, with what appears to be a vast knowledge of Irish folklore (and beyond). HOUNDED is filled with adventure and humor, and some interesting information about the Druidic lifestyle as it (presumably) really was. His voice as Atticus is clear, if not completely unique, and his writing skills are strong.<br /><br />A good start to a new series, albeit imperfect. But I'll definitely be on board for book two.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|How much does it cost to copy and transmit the electronic version of this book?  Virtually nothing.  How much does it cost to physically and mechanically print the book on real paper, package it, transport it, unpack it, index it in a warehouse, and then pull it, re-package it and ship it to the customer?  Substantially more.  Yet the electronic version is priced higher than the hard cover version?  Come on, Hachette, get real.  Sorry Amazon, but you lose my business on this one.  My local library will have it for me in a week or two.  It's not the money it's the principle here.
0525951652|1.0|I've read several other Ken Follett books, and enjoyed all of them. Not this one. At all. It is absolutely interminable. I had to force myself to get through it. Boring, boring, boring! There is very little drama, which is odd for a war-time novel. Things just plod along painfully. In addition, the character development is superficial, at best. In short, it could have been way better, but Follett seemed more interested in cramming every piece of research he could find into the book rather than developing a cohesive story with relatable characters. It is really disappointing. Don't waste your time or money. If you'd like a WWI historical novel that has drama and character development, I'd recommend \\"To the Last Man\\" by Jeff Shaara. It is a superior novel in every way.
0316069353|4.0|Connelly is at the top of his form as defense attorney Mickey Haller succumbs to the economic realities of the current financial environment, expanding his practice to foreclosure defense. Now business is booming with a series of small cases promising no letup as the foreclosure nightmare looms over LA, an all too familiar landscape in California, where unscrupulous lenders and home buyers meet in a perfect storm of opportunism and fraud. Haller has devised a plan that allows his clients to remain in their homes while he files on their behalf, but the rhythm of new business is interrupted when Lisa Trammel, a client, is arrested for the brutal murder of Mitchell Bondurant, the face of the bank's proceedings against her home. Abandoned by her husband, Jobless with a son to raise, Trammel has started her own website, FLAG, a clear target for detectives looking for a suspect for Bondurant's murder. Suddenly Haller is in the middle of a murder trial, Lisa the poster child for every victim of foreclosure and bureaucratic indifference.<br /><br />It is in the courtroom where Connelly shines, a perfectly balanced blend of prosecution and defense, the elaborate strategies of a jury trial, pyrrhic victories and long-term goals, an agitated media searching avidly for the next sound bite. Mickey is in an unpredictable situation with an unreliable client who loudly proclaims her innocence and a wily prosecutor who is an equal adversary for the skilled litigation of the slick Haller. He sets about building a defense, constantly out-maneuvered by the prosecutor and held to the rulings of a strict judge. Connelly's real talent is found in the nuances of courtroom drama, supported by the frantic behind-the-scenes scramble to level the playing field for Trammel and hide her tendency to boil over in righteous indignation.<br /><br />Awakening to the deep flaws in his personal life, Haller vacillates between the tried and true methods that have been successful in his career and the self-examination that that leads him to murkier territory. Connelly juggles Haller's new-found humility with an instinctive courtroom demeanor that has won cases but lost two wives and a daughter. The result is a satisfying, well-written novel that offers a few surprises for even the most jaded crime reader. Luan Gaines/2011.hat that leads him to murkier territory.

B0047Y17P2|1.0|Too bad that I'm not gonna buy this book because I really wanted to read it.  I can't believe that the hardback is cheaper than the digital version!  Why the premium?  I'm sure I've gotten ripped off in the past as I've justified it by the fact that my husband and I share the digital books, but what's the point of having an e-reader if the cost is going to be MORE than the actual book.  Aren't they supposed to be cheaper because there are less costs involved?<br /><br />Maybe someone will come up with a site similar to paperbackswap.com and call it ebookswap.com where we can upload the digital version after reading and earn credits when other members download our books, which we can then use to download ebooks we want to read.  That way you don't feel as guilty paying full price when you can read other bestseller books for free.

0307463745|3.0|Authors Jason Fried & David Heinemeier gave excellent advice about running an internet savvy company. This book is must read for everybody who has startup itch. The book is short and written in plain English - staying true to its preaching. It is packed with advice about `write less code', `meetings are toxic', `planning is guessing' and' build a real business'. Advise I can use everyday.    So, why three stars you may ask?     Authors made it clear they arrived at this conclusion based on their own experience. This is equivalent to a biochemist proclaiming to public `Take this drug - it worked for me. I am sure it will work for you.' Try selling that medicine to general public and watch the fatalities.    Looking at companies that are already successful and deriving a `formula for success' suffers from sampling bias.  I critic books such as 'Good to Great' for same reason.  This methodology is equivalent to saying `Jack, James and Jimmy won running competition. Therefore, you must have name starting with J to win a competition.     37Signal has great products and clearly has great team working behind us. Instead of writing yet another self-help/business book - I wish this was written as 'This is how we built 37signal'. That book would have been interesting for me and worth a read.
0307593495|5.0|There is a translucent feel of slipping into a painting as my eyes move over the pages of Henning Mankell's newest Mystery starring Kurt Wallander and featuring his daughter Linda. More than a time or two, I have wondered about the classification of Mystery vs. Literary Novel when it comes to the Kurt Wallander series. These just are not your typical run of the mill mystery novels, and I suppose that's why I enjoy them so much; I rarely read mysteries.  The characters that Mr. Mankell develops have such depth that they become the story; mystery is eclipsed and remains in the shadows.  Though this may not please the mystery writer, I should think it would at least please the literary novelist that lurks within. I always look forward to a Kurt Wallander story because it feels as if I have boarded a trawler, Skane is in the distance and Kurt is sitting on a bench awaiting my arrival.  The voice of the narrator is so human addressing issues of mortality, futility, and has a caustic sense of humor that I completely relate to.<br /><br />The exchanges between Kurt and Linda are like gulps of fresh Swedish air and have a tendency to make me feel alive.  Maybe I am the only one who relates to Kurt Wallander's feelings, temperament, and outlook on life; though for even this fictional relation, I am eternally grateful.<br /><br />The spy intrigue part of the novel this time became a bit of a bore, and I admit it was little more than a side note. I kept wanting the novel to turn back to the countryside, walks with Jussi, talks with Linda on the phone; arguments about anything and everything; regret; Kurt's father; the impenetrable feeling of being alone, that are the forever blowing winds in a Henning Mankell novel and are admittedly far too addicting.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|It's a decent player, though it would be nice if you could mix the cloud and local tracks.  Also, the way that it hijacks the controls is inconsistent...needs to be a setting to make sure that it acts the way you want.  I had to uninstall because it just ate my battery and when I killed it, it started itself back up again.  I'll be glad to look again once those two things are fixed.
B001AQO3WY|2.0|As expected, HBO followed the Leftist Fundie template: Peace loving, victimized Muslims are slaughtered by homophobic, racist, self-serving dullards in an organization that makes the UN Peace Keepers seem professional by comparison. It was entertaining though.    The need for the political Left to so perfectly invert reality is only overshadowed by their hapless marks who've grown up so steeped in their propaganda that they don't even notice.    Like a tea bag.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|It's free so no real gripe, but keep in mind the ads will block view at critical times so I really do not play it. Other than tha works with no problem on my thunderbolt. Angry Rio is much better.
B003WH765U|5.0|It's a mystery to me why this  Marlon Brando film is not mentioned as one of his starring roles. He is devastating as an Air Force pilot during the Korean War who falls in love with a Japanese woman.  This movie was made in 1957 which explains the discrimination and narrow-mindedness of American occupied Japan, following World War II. The only fault I can find is that the interracial couple are both hero-worshipped and admired by their countrymen; both are famous; he is a war hero and she is a beautiful Japanese entertainer. It follows that it's OK for them to get together. Reminds me of \\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\\" where the interracial couple are picture perfect; she is white; a lovely, wealthy, society lass; and he is black; a handsome, lettered, & successful black man. Expect the same from Sayonara. Red Buttons is excellent as a poor private in love with a common but adorable Japanese woman. Prepare yourself for a tearful ending. It's worth the price of a ticket for Marlon Brando fans who will swoon over his good looks and marvel over his superb acting. Don't miss it!<br />Sayonara!
0679720200|3.0|I read this book because I found a reference to it as something relating to existential philosophy. I currently understand existential philosophy as a doctrine that views man as responsible for his being, for his nature and every act he performs.   The main character throughout the novel shows his indifference to everything. He is responsible for everything but yet he does not care? Surely it won't make any difference to the universe, but it will make a difference to him, which is all that matters.   I for one did not find the book amusing.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Blu-Ray review.  If you are reading this for the DVD or any other format, some of this information may not apply.<br /><br />Film:  4.5/5, Image Quality:  4.5/5, Sound Quality:  4.5/5, Extras:  3.5/5 Overall:  4.5/5 (wounded up in total star ranking)<br /><br />Quality:<br />Having been shot partially on 16mm film, this movie will have a large amount of fine film grain, and a dark overall look that may appear gaudy at first glance.  But it is nicely sharp and detailed throughout.  At some parts, the grain clears up and looks perfect in some scenes. Altogether, it's the best possible transfer given the movie's source limitations and artistic intent.  Sound quality sounded great to me, especially regarding the music and sound effects.<br /><br />Extras include a 49-minute making-of documentary, close to a dozen short featurettes, trailers, and BD-Live and mobile features.<br /><br />For this film's initial release, it comes with a digital copy and a glossy semi-reflective slipcover.  The cover art appears on both the outside and inside of the case, and could be reversible.  Chances are that future pressings of this movie will omit the slipcover and DC in favor of a single-disc in a plain case.<br /><br />Film:<br />Darren Aronofsky has made some of the most remarkable nightmares on film. Whether plunging into the mystique of numerology, the destructive wages of drug abuse, or the woes of a wrestler past his prime, Aronofsky makes films of style and intellect that are topped by very few directors, especially in this day and age. Sure enough, \\"Black Swan\\" is just as worthy of a film as the director's previous efforts.<br /><br />I felt the film started off as a typical, mild character-driven drama; lots of ladies dancing, lots of bitter rivalry and stress, but little on conflict, much less style. But toward the second half, the film became totally whack. A few visual hints are dropped in the first half, which will likely make you blink and ask yourself \\"did I really see that?!\\" In the second half, it becomes substantially more intense, the visuals become extraordinarily trippy and surreal, and all conflict reaches a proper climax. If you stick with it, the film will be engrossing and sublime, with enough emotional punch and food-for-thought to keep you intrigued and entertained. I'd say it's about as rewarding as \\"Fight Club.\\"<br /><br />The story itself is simple and straightforward; a petty drama involving ballerinas doing a bold new vision of the Swan Lake spiel. As the film goes on, it reaches deeper beneath the surface and pulls up some strong character development and refreshing thematic territory. This is very much a story about perfection, not only in the dancers' performances, but in the sense of duality: the union between light and dark creates a perfect balance that ultimately drives the main character to confront, fight, and ultimately transform herself. Not to mention, there are also some strong themes concerning maturity, lifestyles, sexuality, and ambition. The film also manages to throw in decent helpings of paranoia, and works very effectively to toy around with the audience's sense of understanding what's real in the film and what isn't. In the end, it may not be a terribly grandiose plot, but it does have great depth, and I find the central theme of corruption and duality quite elegant.<br /><br />As far as the cinematography goes, I was pleased with the photography; there are some bouncy documentary-style cameras, but not nearly as many as I expected. Editing is excellent. Acting is great; Natalie Portman is perfect as Nina and Vincent Cassel is good.  I usually find it hard to take Mila Kunis seriously, but she actually did a great job here. Writing seems good. Production value is high, and contains some awesome costumes and interesting sets. Clint Mansell's use of classical music fits this movie well, and does have a few standout moments.<br /><br />There are quite a few sex scenes, a few cringe-worthy moments, and a lot of dark surreal imagery, and will likely deter some viewers.  But none of it is overly-graphic or gratuitous at all, and I see little reason not to recommend it to anybody.<br /><br />4.5/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4.5/5, emotional impact: 3/5)one of it is overly-graphic or gratuitous at all, and I see little reason not to recommend it to anybody.    4.5/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4.5/5, emotional impact: 3/5)

B004M20YDU|5.0|Pretty solid album. If you don't believe me... well I feel sorry for you...     I guess you'll have to hear it for yourself? because it's beyond words! :)
B0049D1TCM|4.0|It's a great album. Nicki Manaj is a talented singer as well as rapper. It's burned into my I-Tunes and I am listening to it right now. Amazon helped me get it  for a much better price than any store.
0452286751|4.0|Ayn Rand is a very different writer with her unique philosophy of Objectivism. Her support for the individual is epitomized with Howard Roark who refuses to sacrifice his principles for anyone. There are Five main characters in the book, Howard Roark, Gail Wynand, Peter, Ellsworth, and Dominique. The plot is straight forward, and it is a easy read. The themes the book deals with are integrity and individuality. This book is worth reading.
0446560065|4.0|You will laugh out loud. You will insist that the person beside you have a look. You will exclaim \\"Hey, that's ___!!\\" and everyone will come running to see which one you're talking about. I've never had so much fun \\"reading\\" a book with no words. I'm not a huge cat person (I prefer dogs and have cat allergies) but I've lived with them most of my life. I'm not a huge cartoon fan, but I've read & enjoyed them now & then. I really enjoyed this book!!
1591843790|5.0|Required reading for any creative entrepreneur, brand steward, or marketing guru. In Enchantment, Guy Kawasaki uncovers for us - in plain English and his unique style - what \\"it\\" is about those brands we all love, and why. And most importantly, we come away inspired to action.     Guy's research is gold, and his personal accounts/insightful anecdotes made this book a page-turner.  Bravo.
B004LFO0ME|4.0|Alot of people thing wiz has changed but i dont think so.. He has always tried different styles throughout his career. This album is pretty good and has alot of catchy songs and beats on it! Worth every penny
B004UNB1R4|5.0|Defying time and space, How To Be Clairvoyant is an instant classic.  My favorites include 'He Don't Live Here No More\\", \\"When The Night Was Young\\", and \\"Fear Of Falling\\".  The guests artists and producers perfectly compliment Robbie's unique vocal style.      This is one remarkable album that will appeal not just to Robbie/Band fans, but anyone who appreciates quality songwriting and performing from a true artist who never goes out of style.
0545123275|3.0|Even though Shiver is well written, I didn't have a problem with the purple prose, the story was poorly executed.      I think distant is the best way to describe this book, its characters and the overall plot.  I know readers are supposed to just hang on for the ride, but for some reason Shiver came off as this disembodied journey where all the characters seemed to be riding along beside you.  Like they too were on the outside looking in.  I think this was because there wasn't any real emotion or passion, just an eerie sense of detachment and this feeling of waiting for something, anything to happen.  And it barely does.
B0000931QA|5.0|Good Album I Quess, remembering from my past.  I didn't recieve this album from you, but then again I didn't oder it. that I remember.
B004G6009U|5.0|Ok, first off I am a 26 y/o Male who from time to time likes to veer away from violent movies and watch something a bit innocent. I bought the 3d version of this movie, but to start let me review the story. Disney finally backtracks and goes with something a little bit more familiar. Returning to princesses, heroes, and catchy songs. The story was quite touching as well... something I find quite necessary for a Disney movie. We have a return of the \\"princess sidekick\\" (phillipe in beauty and the beast, sebastian in the little mermaid), pascal the chameleon is an awesome addition bringing a nice touch of humor to the story, along with maximus the horse. Overall, without spoiling the movie, it is your run of the mill CLASSIC Disney movie, which we haven't seen in a long time and is very much needed. The story is clean fun I believe the whole family can and will enjoy.    Now for the graphic and 3d review. If you have a 3d tv GET THIS MOVIE!!! As most of us know Avatar set the standard for 3d by making the 3d give depth to the world and not just use it as a gimmick. Tangled follows in Avatars footsteps and I believe gives Avatar a run for it's money in the 3d aspect. Tangled uses 3d in a way to show distance and detail, rarely using it as a gimmick. Dust from the  musky tower is visible and appears to float right in front  of you in a non invasive way making you feel like you are right there in the tower. The very RARE occasion something is pointed at the screen gives the viewer a sense of surprise and is normally something that would have happened whether the movie was 3d or not... it's not just a gimmick. One part (not  to reveal anything) in 3d will make your hair stand on end.. the detail of not only the picture quality but the 3d is amazing and should definitely be in any 3dtv owners collection.    Overall this movie is a great piece of art on the part of Disney. Keep it up Disney... we are hoping you can once again make the classics we once fell in love with!
B0034G4OY0|1.0|I was really excited about the paranormal part of this story, but then it NEVER went ANYWHERE!  Just when you think, \\"Okay. . .the stories are intertwining and something amazing will happen,\\" the movie ENDS!    Major let down!  Basically, it is one movie with 3 weak stories that never lead to any conclusion.
B004NSULHM|5.0|The more time I spend listening to this, the more I love it. There is  something so beautiful about the song Codex, I sit in my car listing to all of the beautiful detail and have a deeper appreciation each time... catching things I hadnt noticed before, meditative, divine...the shift at 3:35 is stunningly beautiful. Im glad to read the reviews and know other people really understand it.

B004L49K20|5.0|One thing I love about Duran Duran is once you think their going away, they come back with an incredible cd like The Wedding Album in the early 90s and now All you need is now.. This cd is amazing and brings back their old sound. I admit I was a little disappointed with the direction they took with Red carpet Massacre, i felt they didnt need timbaland or timberlake. I just love this cd and every song.. I've been a fan of theirs since I was about 8 years old, the first album I ever had was Seven and the Ragged Tiger. I don't think they get enough credit for their talent, all write their own songs-lyrics and music, amazing pop songs. No one else like them.. Everytime I listen to Duran Duran I get in a good mood, their music always has the affect on me.. They look awesome as well, have not changed a bit, beautiful as ever :)
0316069353|1.0|When I saw the price I thought I was reading it wrong.  I enjoy my books being cheaper on the Kindle.  I thought that was the whole point, saving book printing cost, etc. Anyway, I can go to the library and read for free. That's what I was doing before the Kindle. With that said, I have not read the book although I know it will be a great read. The one star is for trying to rip me off.
B001GZ6QBU|4.0|I have mixed feelings on this... As a Batman fan, half of me adores it and the other half of me expected more. After all, the hype was so much for this film that I expected something more in line with the first film (more about Batman vs the villain). Not a bad film...  a great movie in  fact, but it does leaves something to be desired. I saw this 2 times in the theater but was expecting more from The Joker considering that Heath Ledger gave one hell of a performance. This is much less a Batman film and more of a crime drama with my favorite comic book characters in the background. It would have been nice to set the movie more around Batman, the Joker and Two-Face. There are about 25 to 30 minutes of this film involving a character called Mr. Lau and a Hong Kong subplot that weren't necessary. Like some superhero films before it, there are too many characters and too many situations for its own good.<br /><br />In the end, a great movie, but there are 2 better Batman films: Batman (1989) and Batman Begins (2005). Watch and buy it if you are a comic book fan or a Batman fan. 4 stars!<br /><br />Note: There were no special featurettes on The Joker or Two-Face included on any release of this film.

0061537969|5.0|Wonderful, inspiring, funny and dramatic.  This book touches the inner self and places the reader into situations of challenge.  You find yourself engrossed in the characters and the plot line without difficulty.  Your heart soars and sinks at every victory and defeat.  There are two elements that make this book stand out among the typical heroic drama: one that it is told from the dog's perspective; and two, that there are many exact metaphors for life based on auto racing.  Because it is interesting, and foreign at the same time, the reader can't help but want to know more about not only the story itself; but the true life auto racing that is featured throughout the novel.  All in all a great novel that is not a cookie cutter of a dramatic novel.
B014FJPWEU|5.0|i got this on February 12th,and,ive played it a couple of times. love the remaster on disc one and two,the live disc,and disc 3 the dvd is interesting and a good look back at this excellent band
B002IVLH60|5.0|In this album from one of the best grunge bands ever, Pearl Jam, they got their s**t together to make an amazing album with an amazing balance.    In order, Gonna See My Friend is a hard rock song.  Got Some is a rock song.  The Fixer, probably the most famous track on this album, is a rock song.  Johnny Guitar is a rock song.  Just Breathe, is actually a chill song. One of the only ones some parents can stand on this album.  Amongst the Waves is a chill song as well, a song about relationships, really. You can listen to this number while thinking about that special someone.  Unthought Known, performed on Saturday Night Live by them, is a chill song.  Supersonic is a hard rock song.  Speed of Sound is a chill song.  Force of Nature is a chill song, but not as chill as Unthought Known.  The End is a chill song.    Whoever mixed this album is a genous.    I highly recommend this album.    Just so you know, so you're not suprised if you put all your CDs and the inside booklet into a CD case, and the CD in a CD tower like I do, this CD does have a bootlet, but NOT a plastic case to put in your CD tower. However, this shouldn't lure you away from buying this masterpiece of an album from one of the best bands out there.
B004RUF9DC|1.0|I was very disapointed when started to watch this movie, I've seen VHS transfers look better than this, way, way, way, way to much grain. Whats with all the grain? Buy King of Kings, The Ten Commandmants and The Bible: in the begining instead, all excellent blu ray prints.
B000CNE092|5.0|This is a great film for kids of all ages.  I've enjoyed this movie since I was a kid.  I bought it for a family who never saw the film and they loved it.  The bad guy may be a little scary for the very young but he has a side kick that is hilarious.  I highly recommend this family fun film.
B000W7FDBM|5.0|My daughter and I are Harry Potter fans and started a tradition that after we read the books, we see the movie together at a theater, and, of course, this is the one that started the tradition. The Sorcerer's Stone is probably my favorite of the Harry Potter series, because it starts us on Harry's journey as he discovers he's a wizard. I've read all the books multiple times, and have watched the first four or five movies on TV multiple times, so decided to add them to my video library. I realized recently that I didn't have this one yet; don't know why, but i'm glad I have it now! It arrived very soon after I ordered it, and is in perfect condition! I've already watched it twice and am sure I'll watch it again. It's great fun to lose myself in Harry's magical world when I feel like I just need to escape from my own reality for a little while!

B001MLCX56|1.0|This ranks among the stupidest movies I've ever seen.  I gave it one star only because there's no option for zero stars.  The quality sucks, the acting sucks, the music sucks, the story sucks.  And some people actually gave it 5 stars?  Hope I never meet 'em.
B0041KKYCY|1.0|I saw this movie when I was younger and I must say that till today, I just cant sit still to watch it at all(giving it one because Amazon wont allow me to go without doing so). Yes it is a woman's liberation BUT God damn, this happened in real life and for Hollywood to remake it is a little bit mind blowing to me..Call me whatever you wanna call me but....WOW!!!!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|that's the first thing that came to mind as i walked out of the theater. this movie was much better than i'd hoped, expecting a slightly more fast paced action packed 'independence day' type movie, this ended up being WAY better. it had the feeling of really being with this group of soldiers through the whole thing, and didn't really go for the big picture (where's the president? where's his daughter? we need to make a stand and define ourselves as humans! blah blah blah!). it had the great never safe feeling that really keeps me sucked into a movie... there would be 15 minutes of nonstop shootemup action, which died down long enough for the characters to develope themselves a bit, tally their dead, get a new vehicle and get moving, only to turn a corner and get into another gunfight. i thought the camera work was good and really kept me pulled in, though maybe it was just a bit too shaky, i handled it fine but most of the people i've talked to about it complained of headaches and dizziness. but if you've made it thru 'reality' horror/scifi movies like Quarantine, this isn't nearly as dizzying. and as a bonus, michelle rodriguez wasn't terrible in this movie!! i'll be buying this as soon as it's released. enjoy

B004DK5CW4|2.0|Great cast, but boring movie.  None of the drama of Seabiscuit, which had characters I cared about, and related to, and was a much better film all around.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I used to have Evernote on my iPhone when I was unaware of its invasive use of user data. I was going to het the app for my Eco until I read all of their unnecessary and invasive permission requirements. No thanks.   I'd rather pay a few dollars for an app than have it be free and invasive.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|Saw this in theaters and had to buy it so my friends could see it.  The camera angles, brevity and longevity of certain scenes, and the emotion put into every detail of this movie are what make it.  On my top 5 for sure, but then again I'm a bit outdoorsy myself so it was easy to put myself in this situation - though it's an insult to say that.  I know it translates well into the mindset of a man, but my girlfriend thought it was ok.  Long story short, if you want a movie that will seriously take you through every human emotion in an hour and a half and not only that but will aslo take you on a journey of self-exploration without even knowing it, get it.  You won't regret it.

1400096936|3.0|Let me concede this much: Winslow's novel makes readers think seriously and hard about the cost of the war on drugs.  In the view of the author, America's battle against controlled substances in Mexico, Columbia, and Central America (as well as New York and southern California) is a continuation of a hidden and morality-free war in Vietnam.  In fact, on the American side it involves the very same cast of characters, albeit in different uniforms than the ones they wore in Southeast Asia.  As in Vietnam, the war involves wholesale destruction of the lives, property, and communities of innocents and the corruption of once honorable men who lose their moral compass in the struggle against great evil.  But wait!  Even the evil-doers have a heart!  They have tender concern for their own children, especially children afflicted from birth with pitiful and ugly defects.  Of course,this confusing virtue does not prevent them from casually slaying the wives and infant children of their enemies ...    As an innocent myself, I have no way of assessing the accuracy of the author's portrayal of Mexico's rising drug-and-crime culture.  From what I read in the newspapers, the shocking violence against innocents depicted in the book is based on incidents that can be tracked down in Mexican and U.S. news reports.  The deeper mystery is whether the author's narrative of the sinister role of the CIA and Drug Enforcement Administration is plausible.  Might his representation be based on verifiable facts?  Or is it the product of the author's paranoia and literary license?  Only his analyst knows for sure.    Turning to the writer's craft, I see no reason why my fellow reviewers think it deserves a grade of A+ (or five stars).   The book is almost numbingly long, and by the time one encounters the fourth or fifth amazing coincidence in which all or all but one of the major protagonists escape nearly certain death, one's patience tends to wear a bit thin.  If you are squeamish about clinical, almost poetic, descriptions of gruesome torture, you might want to look elsewhere for your next fix of escapist trash.

1416562605|4.0|It has taken forever to get this book off my Reading List and into my hands, because I thought it would be a) Boring (did I really want to read about a halwai ? Maybe I could do laundry first) , b)Depressing, like so many other Indian-authored books tend to be,  and c)Lofty with a chance of Meatballs (A Booker prize no less; maybe all the erudite prose would  zip way above my head). Now don't get me wrong, I don't mean Depressing as in \\"how depressing is this writing\\", rather it is the subject matter which sorta gets me down. Authors like Divakaruni and a host of others spin their stories from a ground reality, which fiction though it may be, hints at how it really is (no smoke without a fire, yes ? especially since if you've been to the South-Asian sub-continent or lived there for as many years as I have, you've viewed the fire first-hand).<br /><br />Anyway, just plain old get-it-out-of-the-way-ness drove me, and wow! Am I glad it did. Yes, this is the story of a man born into the halwai caste/profession, into desperate poverty, in the undeveloped backwaters of the great Indian State, which Adiga in the book calls  the Darkness. Balram, for that is his name, brought up by his nagging and cruel aunt, is pulled out of school very early like his siblings, and put to work.  He is ambitious though and manages to work his way up, slowly but surely, using his opportunities wisely and quelling the innate desire (as he puts it) to be trod upon.<br /><br />The entire book is in the first person, told from Balram's point of view. And what a point of view it is ! At times acidic, and at others almost mellow, Adiga gives voice to his finely textured character with great skill and candor. Balram is a veritable \\"angry young man\\"but describes his situations in a witty, sardonic, sometimes steel-edged sarcasm.<br /><br />Adiga's story gets down to what I would call the brass tacks, since it describes outright what most books only hint at - the frustration, despair and demeaning nature of poverty, the dual nature of India's society, and the deplorable lack of law and order and justice for India's unwashed masses. In the midst of the swirling blackness, Balram rails and fights against the powers that strive to keep him down. He definitely isn't like all of his peers, but will that be enough ?<br /><br />I totally loved this book, the plot, the pace, the storytelling, the descriptions - everything. Adiga has produced a remarkable book, engaging and thought-provoking, and while it entertains it also leaves with you squirming in uneasiness. Highly recommended.dual nature of India's society, and the deplorable lack of law and order and justice for India's unwashed masses.

B004ISVH6G|4.0|I've bought this CD because I wondering what John Waite has been up to.  Overall it's very good.  The material is strong as are the performances.  It lacks, in my opinion, a little polish in the production/sound area.  I think that with a bigger budget it would be a great release.  That shouldn't stop anyone who likes John Waite from buying the CD but it's the reason for the four stars.

B001HN6940|5.0|I got the Tim Burton Alice in Wonderland DVD to watch with my parents who were visiting during the week of the Academy Awards.    Although this is a Tim Burton film it is much lighter and innocent than some of his other special effects films, which can be pretty dark.     This is really an art film in the sense of its beauty and color and surprises.  We enjoyed it!
B00004CYQL|5.0|I the item I purchased was not what was pictured, but the sellar did give me a refund, and I mailed the item back.
B004BLJQOK|2.0|Readers of the Swedish novel this film is based on will be both relieved and disappointed with this big screen adaptation. They'll be relieved that the movie leaves out some of the most disturbing elements of the novel, such as pedophila and Abby's (Eli's) sexual ambiguity. Though it is hinted at, it is never really explored in the film. Neither are her origins. This may be a relief to some, frustration for others.<br /><br />Those who have read the novel first will be disappointed that a lot of the back story so important to the novel is not covered in the film. That's to be expected to some extent for a film trying to remain under 2 hours in duration, but viewers who have not read the book will be left with a lot of questions and few answers. They'll feel like large parts of the story are missing and they'll question the motivations of characters because the movie doesn't offer them.<br /><br />Readers of the book and non-readers of the book will be equally disappointed. This isn't a great horror film, nor is it a great vampire film. It's not even a good adaptation of a very successful and popular novel.
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|Fantastic acting, beautifully orchestrated music, magical special effects make Peter Pan a movie that takes you to Neverland and back home again a truly grand and magical adventure. No matter how old you are, this movie makes you feel like a kid again. Way better than the Disney movie, don't rent it...buy it! It's that good!!
B001B4JVKE|5.0|I just knew about Katie Melua, about one month ago, while I was watching TV, then I looked for her in You Tube, and I knew she just made a new fan: Me.  She´s a real and complete artist: She is a \\"down to the world\\" person, I recomend to read or watch some of her interviews, she writes beautiful songs, she has a great voice, she connects really well with the audience and she´s gorgeus! She´s a real positive influence. I hope to see her in Mexico some time.
B000M341RI|5.0|'The Full Monty' is a priceless comedy featuring a great cast.  A group of unemployed middle aged men who are a bit down on their luck- and their self esteem- decide to do a one-night-only on-stage bit as male strippers and give their audience 'the full monty' to make a lot of cash fast.  Robert Carlyle and his co-stars deliver a lot of laughs to be had again and again in this one-of-a-kind British comedy.
B0042K4ZZK|5.0|I really was not that interested at first, but I can honestly say this show keeps improving. The plot keeps moving forward and now that an important character within Division knows Nikita and Alex's connection, I am curious how the rest of the season will play out.
B000O77RLE|2.0|I watched this movie a short while after I had watched HBO's mini-series \\"The Pacific\\". Both the mini-series and the included supplementary interviews with American veterans amply documented the fanatical, inhuman brutality that the Japanese forces exhibited throughout the war.<br /><br />I'll bet every one of those veterans would bristle at the touchy-feely treatment given to the main characters in this film. While there may have been a few Japanese soldiers that acted with what we would consider humane and human reactions to conflict, this movie did a dis-service to history by not also explicitly documenting the maniacal attitude most of the Japanese were imbued with and the resulting atrocities they committed, both to the living and the dead.
B0020VKZ4I|4.0|I am a Diana Krall fan but although I prefer her peppier jazz vocals, I can appreciate the \\"Quiet Nights\\" album.  \\"Quiet Nights\\", besides being a track on the album, describes the style of the album as a whole.  It is a smooth soft bossa-nova vocal jazz.  The kind of music to listen to when you're being mellow and restful.<br /><br />If you are looking for music to play while at the gym, this isn't it.  If you are looking for music to play with the lights turned down low and drinking a glass of wine in front of the fireplace, this may be up your alley.

159420229X|4.0|I was initially intrigued when a review through wired brought to my attention this book and its uncanny ability to improve your memory( like so many other snake oils). Reading through it , it keep me interested, Joshua Foer has had an interesting year with flamboyant individuals in this non-fiction book, and retells it well. Although the techniques described in his book are only scratching at the surface of memory training. His citation and bibliography are in-dept enough to further research the technique. I found this book very helpful and have built a few memory palaces(spoiler ) for myself.
0545302862|4.0|Great stories.  First book was made into a movie, and as usual, the book is FAR superior to the movie.  Wonderful characters, great story line, fun action.  My 13 year old boy loves these stories.  I tend to read what he reads, after he's done, so we can talk about the books, and I really am enjoying these a lot.  A very fast read, as well.  And it's great to refresh my knowledge about the Greek myths.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|I was incredibly disappointed by this movie.  I was expecting to see the characters created by Arthur Conan Doyle. However, this movie, while it uses the names of Doyle's creation, bears little resemblance to them.    If you've read the Holmes stories, don't waste your time on this misrepresentation.
0385523912|5.0|As my title suggests, I am deeply impressed and convicted by this well-researched and appropriately written piece. I initially sought a book that would provide a fresh and updated lens on the North Korean realm beyond Pyongyang, and Demick undoubtedly delivered. After my first read, I am now thirsty for more knowledge and information about the defectors and the perspective worlds they have left behind. Though I am also left with a more questions regarding some of the characters in the book, they are merely constructive questions about how I can be of service for this growing migration of defectors one day.     Overall, Demick created something that has now become very personal of a phenomenon for me. I can only encourage any potential reader to dive into this book as soon as possible--either as an academic or not.
B004L3AQFG|5.0|Amazon as always has provided great service!!  quick deliveries and all the products have been top notch!!!  the movie I just bought was a blue ray disc and was fantastic and came exactly when they said it would!!!    GOOD JOB AMAZON!!!!!
B002ZG974M|5.0|Watched this movie last night with my boyfriend.<br /><br />I knew it wasnt going to be an action movie,I knew it wasnt going to have CGI talking babies, or a british guy narrating. Not every movie needs a guidebook. This movie is as simple as they come, its about 4 babies from different parts of the world. It shows us how diverse the cultures are, but at the core how we are are so very much alike. We dont need translation, subtitles to know what is going on...well maybe with the San Fran baby but thats because I dont speak granola.<br /><br />The people who get appalled at these Babies \\"in danger\\", need to open up their minds. The rest of the world isnt going to be exactly like the USA. No matter how much you want it to be, no matter how proud to be an american you are, we cannot expect other cultures to suddenly wake up and discard centuries of traditions and customs to be just like us. They are doing just fine, as we can see in this movie. Babies, arent made of glass, although not indestructable, we as a species somehow survived without a[[ASIN:B0009JOSNM BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier Original, City Black]] or god forbid a[[ASIN:B000I2WB6G Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer]] and even carseats/seatbelts. I myself never wore one, or was in one as a kid and Im thriving.<br /><br />My mom used to say \\"God made dirt, and dirt doesnt hurt\\"<br /><br />I loved this movie so much, it made me giggle, and smile, and we talked throughout about what we were seeing. Its an interactive film in that way. I was exposed to cultures and traditions and ways of life I had no idea about, and I came away feeling more connected to the human race as a whole because of it. I also came away realizing that babies everywhere are friggin hilarious!! So awesome movie, go watch it!
0446195529|4.0|A fun page turning, political thriller with an elaborate plot. The ending was a tad too predictable--hence the reason it only got 4 stars. A worthwhile read if you like the genre.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Season five of supernateral is well written and enjoyable to watch. The angel story line has greatly increased the spooky factor while the usual campy sense of humor remains. This is the best season so far.
B001I9B9I4|5.0|I too totally enjoyed this film and was delighted at the morality the lead charaters chose when so often in the movies they make distructive choices. These were good people who denied themselves for the greater good. How refreshing and so needed for young people to see. Thank you for making this film. I will now be one of my favorites.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Neon Genesis Evangelion made its first television appearance in Japan in 1995, and with it followed an abundance of critical acclaim and various films that catapulted it into the pantheons of Japanese animation. The release of Evangelion 1.0 (1.11) only solidified just how important Evangelion is, by redefining and re-visualizing some of the most important scenes between episodes 1 through 6 of the original series, this film knocks it out of the ball park.<br /><br />Not much can be said about the plot if one has seen the original series, as it is pretty much a copy and paste job; take a couple of angel fights and character dialogue. For those that have not experienced the series before in their life, basically a 14 year old boy by the name of Shinji Ikari is called upon to pilot one of the biological mecha known as Evangelion (Eva) in order to take down the mysterious destructive lifeforms known as Angels. Throughout the film, Shinji searches deep within for the meaning behind his actions and his existence, often breaking down and exploring the psychology of his mind in attempts to unravel what is true to him. Along with a complex set of supporting characters, the film never leaves the audience disinterested.<br /><br />The film looks absolutely stunning, especially in 1080p; which is one of the main reasons why an Evangelion fan should purchase the blu-ray edition of the film. Every scene in the film has been re-worked from the ground up to give Evangelion the look it was always meant to have.<br /><br />When it comes to the audio, once again the film excels in respect to any of the older material. Support for Dolby TrueHD 6.1 for both the English and Japanese dub means that everyone will be happy. In terms of dialogue (English dub), the film certainly has less dialogue than the original first six episodes, but that is to be expected with an hour and forty minutes to cover the said episodes. What one gets is a re-dubbing of the original dialogue that makes the character dialogue seem much more natural and clear than in the original dub. The soundtrack remains the same Shirou Sagisu composed tracks that defined most if not all of the prominent scenes in the original series, either enhanced or re-done to sound better than ever.<br /><br />In conclusion, Evangelion 1.11 is a must buy for any Evangelion fan and newcomer alike. It is a prominent piece of art that continues to define what Anime can be expected to accomplish.
B004GYY714|3.0|Tune In Radio app is a really good app besides that it drains your battery. I checked my battery usage while using it and it was using 18% of my battery.

B00005U152|4.0|I thought the acting was very good. Anthony Quinn was excellant as the hunch back. As for Esmarelda, Gina Lolo was the movie. She captivates in all her seens.
0817439390|5.0|This is a must read for any aspiring photographer. I have read quite a few books and nobody explains it in such simple and easy to understand terms. It may be a little too simple for the pros but then again, the pros probably don't read books anymore. Take a look at his youtube videos, they are great as well, once you get past his hair. LOL I am even thinking about taking his online course just because he is so good at explaining the stuff. The one thing that stuck with me beyond all else is there are many correct exposures but only one CREATIVELY correct exposure. I am still very new to photography but that is one thing I think about every time I am setting my aperture and shutter speed. \\"Is this capturing what I want in the way I want to capture it\\" The guy is great, I wish he would make more videos.    Oh and the pictures in the book aren't hard on the eyes either. Some amazing photos. The guy has traveled around the world and and seen and photographed landscapes that ALMOST make me believe in god.    Buy this one and anything he puts out. I did, you won't regret it.
B004NS7120|5.0|Well done.  Expected it to be a an average movie and turned out to have some twists and turns that keep it going.
B0049P1VHS|1.0|Lackluster,wooden acting,and the last episode was like a mission in Resident Evil.(I was waitting for Tyrant to brake though the wall)I had been a fan of the comic since jump and looked forward to the show.Letdown more so than Watchmen and V for Vendetta.Let me make a suggestion(Hollyturd will ignore it) No more comic book,video game,or zombie films for 10yrs.Face its all becoming recyled.

And I never watch \\"Love Stories\\".    When I saw the drug part I thought it would be about one of them strung out on drugs and going to rehab.           This movie is so real life and down to earth you have to see it!  I bought it \\"used\\" at a good price and it works perfect........Thank you.

0316069353|1.0|I have been waiting for weeks for this book to become available.  But when I saw the price, I said \\"No way!!\\"  I HATE being ripped off by GREEDY people and the published of this book definitely qualifies.  Instead of honoring loyal readers, publishers choose to take advantage of us.  Guess I will give my Kindle a rest and head for the library for the FREE hardcover of this book.
1603425381|5.0|This book of Crochet Borders is fantastic.  The presentation and descriptions are beautiful.

B003UESJHO|1.0|I will start off by saying I think Christian Bale and Marc Walberg are crap actors.  I also don't like the fact it appeared as though Christian Bale was on crystal meth in this movie, hence all the weight loss and cracked out looking face.  The other factor why I didn't like this film is that the premise of the movie has already been done, 5 times.  Rocky 1,2,3,4,5.  This was an overated piece of crap.
B00139B39E|4.0|I love Dream Theater. When I'm feeling depressed about the state of modern music, or indeed the state of modern society in general, I put on a Dream Theater album - then for the next 80 minutes or so, all is right with the world. Dream Theater is not a \\"hits\\" band. They are not a band that you put on at a party to get people dancing or listen to in the background while doing the dishes. They are a \\"progressive\\" band, which means their albums are conceptual works of art in which each song is a part of a larger whole. That indicates pretentiousness to many people, but to me it means pure bliss. Music where the music really matters. Music made by people who can play their instruments absurdly well and can compose a complex, layered piece of music rather than just a catchy pop song. Musicians who use lyrics to explore a variety of topics ranging from personal to societal to philosophical. The prospective listener is by this point either completely turned off or has stopped reading in order to click the Add to Cart button. However, I would caution the prospective listener to shun this compilation despite the high quality of the music it contains. These are great songs, and I like the idea of separating the two-disc set into hard rockers and ballads. Dream Theater should be experienced in album form, warts and all. Perhaps the albums are a bit excessive at times, perhaps preachy, perhaps overlong but that's what the group is. Take it or leave it. To the newcomer, I would recommend purchasing Images and Words, followed by Metropolis Pt 2: Scenes from a Memory. If you are moved and inspired by those two, definitely follow suit with Awake, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, Octavarium, A Change of Seasons and all the rest. It will be money well spent. If you choose to buy Greatest Hit and that is the extent of your Dream Theater collection, you are really missing out.

0316077054|4.0|This is the same review I wrote for the first book Beautiful Creatures, as I read the two books back to back...<br /><br />I can't remember how I came across these books but as a newcomer to the South, I'm on a binge of 'Southern gothic' reading. I really enjoyed Beautiful Creatures and the follow up Beautiful Darkness, and am looking forward to Beautiful Chaos when it comes out. For me the book was lyrically written in a way that I felt I was a part of the mystical world described. I cringed in a few places where Southern cliches popped up (it's like people just can't resist getting in a dig, I guess). I live in a tiny Southern town in the buckle of the Bible belt and have only met generous, open-minded people. Maybe the crazies live in the Tunnels...or out West where I used to live. You wanna talk rednecks...<br /><br />Anyway, while Ethan's POV sometimes felt a little unrealistic for a 16 yo boy, I still found him very likeable and his romance with Lena (who I wished I got to know better) was very sweet. He treated her well and loved his family. Maybe that's what kept me reading. It's refreshing to see characters once in a while who aren't absolutely awful and rebellious and abusive to their significant others. Actually, it might be Link who ultimately steals my heart :)
B002PHVHFI|5.0|I threw this record on my dad's old turntable, and about an hour later, I sat back and asked the sky, \\"What just happened to my ears?\\" Well, I was gob-struck at the time, but I figured it out; my ears had experienced a pretty cool, off-beat record. It's not by any means the best thing I've ever heard, or even the most (adjective) record I've ever heard. Still, it's a solid disc, and well worth a listen.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I purchased the Kindle for much of the same reason as other reviewers have, for the discount pricing of the ebooks.  This has gotten out of hand.  For an ebook to be more expensive than the hardcover is ridiculous.  I was looking forward to reading this book but I am not going to be purchasing it at this time.  Maybe these bad reviews will allow our voices to be heard.  It's a shame that the book which I am sure is as good as all his others will have the appearance it is rated low but I guess that is a lesson to learn when you try to gouge your readers.
B003UESJHE|4.0|I would just like to point out George was not King of England as there has not been one since Henry VIII or a Queen since Elizabeth Ist.    He was King of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as is his daughter Elizabeth the present Queen, who strictly speaking is Queen Elizabeth Ist not 2nd as there has never been a previous Elizabeth on the British throne. Being a Scot, it's only proper to get the facts about the monarch of my country correct.    Superb acting from the two male leads (Rush should have won the Oscar for best supporting) telling a fascinating true story during a turbulent period of history. Oscar worthy performances but maybe not the film as its really suited to tv or the stage. Very witty script and a real feelgood film.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This series has twists, turns and surprises. Be patient the first episode is slow, it is setting up the politics,family background, and characters. This series does not dissappoint! The characters all play their parts sooo well and make each show believeable. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to 300 years condensed to hours which is what makes this series uno uno uno to see. I only watch things maybe twice but I've had to watch this over many times cause it makes me know there is no way I'd live back in that era of time.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|This has to be most ridiculous Kindle pricing I've seen yet.  16$ more than the paper version?  I don't care that the \\"publisher set the price\\".  Amazon should refuse to sell the paper _and_ electronic versions if they are not going to offer fair pricing for Kindle readers.  That's on Amazon.  If they want loyal Kindle owners they need to stand up for them.
B004G6009U|5.0|Beautiful Rapunzel's story is as old as I can remember, and it's almost impossible not to think about her every time you see a girl with extremely long hair. Therefore, it was only a matter of time before the creative minds at Disney adapted it into an animated movie, the result being the delightful and very entertaining \\"Tangled.\\"     The story revolves around a magical flower that has healing powers, something that a lady named Mother Gothel has known for years. She knew the location of the flower in the wild, and used it for years to prevent aging and keep herself young and beautiful. However, one day the Queen, who was pregnant, became ill, and the King, knowing about the plant, sent his soldiers to search for it. They eventually find it and the flower's power cured her and she was able to give birth to Princess Rapunzel. Because Rapunzel's hair was golden like the flower, Mother Gothel realized that the baby's hair would also keep her young. So she decides to kidnap Rapunzel one night and take her to the tall tower where she lives. Time passes and the Princess grows up alone in that tower, thinking that Mother Gothel was her mother. She was not allowed to step out of the tower, so that she could not discover the truth. Enter Flynn Rider, a handsome thief, who has a charm of his own. He will be the key to Rapunzel's freedom.    As every Disney movie, \\"Tangled\\" is full of fun characters that create hilarious situations. It is very colorful in every sense of the word. Never mind, of course, about the thief-princess formula. Disney always finds a way to keep the story fresh and engaging. This is fun for all family. The remarkable two-disc Blu-ray / DVD edition includes deleted scenes, a making-of feature, storyboard openings, and much more. (USA, 2010, color, 100 min plus additional materials)    Exclusively reviewed by Eric Gonzalez, on April 4, 2011.
0446563048|1.0|...and that would have been to use the book as a fire starter.  The font changes and structure of the book drove me crazy.  A professional editor may have given Tony Hsieh some advice about quoting text.  In general, the reader does not need to see the FULL content of the quoted material.      If this was not meant to be an autobiography, we probably didn't need to know some of the minute details about the author's early years of worm farming and button making or not being able to get out of bed to go to classes in college.    I think I will not take the author's advice and call to order a pizza instead of buying shoes.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This was very handy to have on a recent trip to DisneyWorld.  Doesn't take up much space, drink holders hold things securely.  I used the middle pocket for storing cell phone, napkins, etc.  Would recommend this to anyone!

B0000DC13U|2.0|This film is unfocused and of little interest to musicians who hope to get an inside look at the Stones' process of developing songs in the studio. I was looking for something along the lines of Let It Be, but this is all about one song only, and large sections are buried under seemingly random rambling by a male voice affecting a literary quality.<br /><br />Then there are the completely unrelated sections taking place out on the street and in a junkyard and elsewhere.<br /><br />If you're looking for absurdity mixed with psychedelia and 60s music, I'd recommend the Monkees' Head which is much more fun and also very interesting and thought-provoking.
0143058525|5.0|I listened to this as an audiobook, so my experience may be different than that of other people.<br /><br />This audiobook was read by the author and I think that's what made me enjoy the story as much as I did. Had I simply read the book, I may have only given it 4/5 stars. Gilbert does a fabulous job reading. She keeps a good pace, is clear and articulate, and you can hear emotion in her voice. In addition, I felt like I was getting more of the experience of her trip from her reading because not only was she reading/pronouncing the Italian, Indian, and Indonesian words the way she had learned them, but she used appropriate voices for each of her acquaintances, friends, and even the little medicine man she met along the way.<br /><br />This story is about her journey, post divorce, of trying to find and balance herself. It's told from her perspective so the reader only hears what Gilbert experienced and then wanted to share. While in Italy, she didn't visit museums, so don't be disappointed when you don't hear about the Sistine Chapel and other famous Italian art. Gilbert made friends, learned Italian, and enjoyed Italian food. Her love of the country, the people she met, and the food she ate is incredible. It makes the reader want to get on a plane and go!<br /><br />Next she goes to India for a few months and studies in the ashram of her former lover's yogi. After 6 weeks (I think) at the ashram, she had planned on traveling around India for a couple of months. However, she was making progress (finally) with her meditation, and decided to stay at the ashram for the entirety of her India visit. Listening to her story of meditation and struggles with understanding herself and her mind is interesting and eye opening.<br /><br />Finally, she ends up in Bali visiting the medicine man who got this idea in her head in the first place. While in Bali, she makes a good friend with a woman and her family as well as falling in love with a man. Gilbert ends up splitting her time between the three people and helping each one in her own way as well as each of them helping her with her life.<br /><br />The tone of the book was light and honest, with moments of seriousness. This book will make you want to learn Italian, go eat pizza, start meditating more, and visit Bali (but not live there). Eat, pray, love.d helping each one in her own way as well as each of them helping her with her life.    The tone of the book was light and honest, with moments of seriousness.

I love this show so much, and I was very worried about the quality of the discs and the cover, and what would happen on the way home, but when I received it, it was in excellent shape, which was a great relief! This show is an absolutely amazing show, full of epic adventures, both hilarious and scary, awesome special effects and sound, and just the loveliest boys, and this season was beyond incredible! I can't wait until I get all the seasons! :) SUPERNATURAL MY FOREVER LOVE &lt;3
B004U8VWLE|1.0|Very disapointed in this movie.  Was very hard to sit through. Certainly would not watch it a 2nd time.  The sexual content ruined this movie and limits the people you can share it with.  We cannot add this to our movie collection and will toss it into the trash can.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|I have been watching The Tudors and decided to take a little side trip and watch The Other Boleyn Girl (Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana) to get a feel for more of the Boleyn story.  Well, now I am completely confused.<br /><br />Though both stories are dealing within the same period and the same basic characters, the two adaptations could not be any more different.  Now I understand poetic license, but when facts are toyed with, it leaves the watcher quite befuddled.<br /><br />For instance, Mary Boleyn is referred to as the older sister in The Tudors and the younger sister in The Other Boleyn Girl, so off to Google to find out.  According to The House of Tudor, Mary is the older sister.  OK, The Tudors got this one right.  The Other Boleyn Girl tell of an illegitimate child that Mary bore during her time with Henry the VIII, The Tudor's doesn't comment on this.  This time to Wiki.  Apparently, Mary bore two children, but then again who is counting.  So I will give that one to The Other Boleyn Girl.  Now the most curious part, the end of The Other Boleyn Girl shows Mary taking the young Elizabeth and leaving Court to raise the child.  Really, does anyone think that was possible?  I thought Governess cared for her, but then people do like a happily ever after ending when dealing with royalty.<br /><br />The more I look into the Tudor history, the more confused I get.  I understand that movie making is supposed to be fantasy, but how hard would it be to research what is \\"known\\" and go from there instead of making it up as you go.<br /><br />Now back to the actual movie.  Overall, it is quite a stunning spectacle.  The costuming and staging are beautiful.  The casting is reasonable, though Henry should have been shorter and rounder, but then again who would want to see that.  I have also seen in some reviews that the sex scenes in The Other Boleyn Girl shocked people.  Well, if you are offended by that, which there really was not much shown, it is a PG-13 after all; I suggest that you completely bypass The Tudors.  That one will make you blush.<br /><br />Unless you know some of the prior history of the time, you would have been lost in this movie.  The timing is a bit choppy, sort of like a Cliff Notes version of a small part of the Tudor Period.  If you are not looking for a history lesson you might like this movie, but just be warned that it is an adaptation of Philippa Gregory's historical fiction novel and not necessarily a work of fact.u completely bypass The Tudors.

B004L79VUI|4.0|Solo releases from Robbie Robertson have been few and far between over the last 25 years. \\"How To Become Clairvoyant\\" is Robertson's fifth solo album and holds up well against his first two[[ASIN:B000000OQL Robbie Robertson]]and [[ASIN:B000000ORY Storyville]]. I'll admit that Robertson lost me with his last two releases which strayed too far from what he does best--write evocative songs and play a mean guitar.<br /><br />\\"\\"Clairvoyant\\" strikes a good balance between what Robertson did well on his work with The Band and solo along with his last more experimental solo releases. Featuring guests such as Steve Winwood who contributes evocative soulful organ playing (although a guest vocal might have been welcome as well he doesn't sing on any songs), Eric Clapton (Clapton also penned an instrumental for the album, sings harmony vocals, a duest with Robertson, co-wrote two songs and appears on seven tracks), \\"How To Become Clarivoyant\\" thematically touches on a variety of subjects including Robertson leaving The Band. \\"She's Not Mine\\" is an emotionally naked and powerful love song that stands up with Robertson's best work both in and outside The Band.<br /><br />Although often musically compelling Robertson's way with words sometimes becomes lost making this one of his less lyrically precise and memorable releases.

0553386794|1.0|This rant is spoiler-free and covers A Game of Thrones through A Feast for Crows.<br /><br />Last night, I finished the last 23 pages of A Feast for Crows, book 4 in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice in Fire series. I said to my roommate Andrea, before going to bed, that I had 23 pages to go and that my friend Todd had mentioned one of the characters who he had hated in the beginning of the series actually becoming interesting later on in the series. I shook the book at Andrea and cried, \\"WHEN?!\\" I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if you can barely remain awake during the last 23 pages of book 4 of a supposedly great series, maybe it's not such a great series. I really, really disliked book 1, A Game of Thrones. But, Andrea had read it and loved it. Todd had read it and loved it. Seemingly everyone in the world read it and loved it. So, I thought there must be something wrong with me. I just wasn't getting what was so great. Perhaps I hadn't really applied myself. I spoke to my friend Scott S., who said that he has tried to read the first book three or four times and could not get through it (HOORAY, I'm not alone!). He said that a coworker of his read the series and loved it, but claimed that book 2, A Clash of Kings, is where things really get going. WRONG. WRONG WRONG WRONG. And while I will agree that book 4 is the weakest of the series, it's just more of the same s***, only with less interesting characters! Books 1-4 focus on eleventy-billion characters. Every chapter you switch characters. So, you spend roughly 20-30 pages with a character and then hundreds of pages later, you return to that character. Sometimes, a minor character is introduced in that one chapter that you read several hundred pages ago. When you return to the main person in that chapter, you're goddamned lucky if you remember who the minor character was who was introduced way back when. You're already juggling so many characters, so many plotlines, you just can't retain anything else. And then, with so many of the characters, instead of any real action happening, you just end up trudging through repeats of the same old boring internal monologue that he or she has been having since FOREVER. And then, as a reward for reading that boring s*** over and over, they get killed, having accomplished jack s***. Thank you, Mr. Martin! I don't even understand how anyone gets attached to characters in this series because you don't get to spend any time with them and then when you do, it's more of the same boring s***.<br /><br />Last night, when I managed to finish the last 23 pages, I got to George R. R. Martin's cute little p.s. I have replaced character names with \\"X\\" because some of you are still trudging through the series and I'd hate to spoil it for you by letting you know someone has not yet been killed. The editor notes are mine.<br /><br />\\"`Hey, wait a minute!' some of you may be saying about now. `Wait a minute, wait a minute! Where's X and the X? Where's X? We hardly saw X. That can't be all of it...'<br /><br />Well, no. There's more to come. Another book as big as this one. [ed. What a shock!]<br /><br />I did not forget to write about the other characters. Far from it. I wrote lots about them. Pages and pages and pages. Chapters and more chapters. I was still writing when it dawned on me that the book had become too big to publish in a single volume... and I wasn't close to finished yet. To tell all of the story that I wanted to tell, I was going to have to cut the book in two.<br /><br />The simplest way to do that would have been to take what I had, chop it in half around the middle, and end with `To Be Continued.' The more I thought about that, however, the more I felt that the readers would be better served by a book that told all the story for half the characters rather than half the story for all the characters. So that's the route I chose to take. [ed. What the hell is he talking about? This entire series is one endless To Be Continued! The only resolution you ever get is when someone f***ing dies! And were the readers really better served by a book focusing almost exclusively on the most boring and/or loathsome characters? Not that it made much difference to me, since I found the other 3 books boring and endless, too. As I mentioned previously, this one just had the added bonus of less interesting characters. Hooray!]<br /><br />X, X, X, X and X, X, and all the rest of the characters you love or love to hate will be along next year (I devoutly hope) in A Dance with Dragons, which will focus on events along the Wall and across the sea, just as the present book focused on King's Landing.\\"<br /><br />- George R. R. Martin, June 2005<br /><br />That's right. He wrote that afterward in June of TWO THOUSAND FIVE. He predicted a release date of 2006. Guess when A Dance with Dragons came out? That's right, never! Martin recently confirmed a July 2011 release date. And he's STILL writing the goddamned thing.<br /><br />At some point when I was wading through this series, Andrea said she thought book 4 was the last book and I showed her that A Dance with Dragons was still to come. Then, in commentary on my friend Jason B's FB conversation about the release date, I said, \\"Is book 5 supposed to be the last one? Because if that's what he says, I DON'T BELIEVE HIM!\\" A friend of Jason's said, \\"The 6th one is supposed to be the last.\\" Yah, right. Then I read that there are supposed to be SEVEN. SEVEN! SEVEN endless books! Jason said last night that maybe Martin was \\"building up to something supremely awesome.\\" And I said, \\"I'm sorry, but if it takes you 6 books (and I still don't believe that will be the end, nor that he will ever actually complete the series) to build up to something supremely awesome, you're doing it wrong.\\"<br /><br />George R. R. Martin wrote a beautiful novella called A Song for Lya. It won the Hugo for Best Novella in 1975. I am having trouble reconciling that Martin, the one who could tell a powerful story in a short span of time, with this Martin, who can't seem to finish a story EVER, let alone make me actually care about the characters or what's happening. I have been tempted to go back and read A Song for Lya again, but I'm afraid that my current feelings for Martin will completely ruin the A Song for Lya experience.<br /><br />My friend Scott S. mentioned some other series whose universe was supposed to be richly realized. Scott said something along these lines: it couldn't help but be a richly realized universe because the author described every goddamned cobblestone in every street.<br /><br />Everyone keeps saying how masterful the Martin series is and, in my opinion, the only masterful stroke is Martin's inexplicable ability to keep a**holes reading it. Even a**holes like me, who hate the whole goddamned series. There were probably at least 400 times where I would stop reading mid-sentence, take a deep breath and think, \\"F*** this. I DON'T GIVE A S***.\\" And I didn't. I truly didn't care what happened to anyone. And then, inexplicably, I would keep reading. After a certain point, it became this masochistic challenge. I didn't want this series to defeat me. I WANTED to understand the allure. But, nearly 4000 pages later, I failed. And after my mini-rant last night, and after finishing book 4, I was so tired, so broken, my soul so completely crushed, I couldn't bear to write about it this morning. As you can see, I got over it. However, I am DONE with this f***ing series. Lucky for me, Martin isn't even done writing book 5 and even if I WANTED to read book 5, I wouldn't remember most of the characters by the time it came out and there is no way in hell I would ever go back and read books 1-4 again to refresh my memory.<br /><br />I want to punch George R. R. Martin in the face. And then I want to punch myself in the face for sticking with this goddamned series for so long.<br /><br />Final thought: Just because it's epic doesn't mean it's good.finish a story EVER, let alone make me actually care about the characters or what's happening.

B004FECNIO|4.0|If you want a short review of the film, I'd suggest going elsewhere.<br /><br />Originally conceived as a film for director Stanley Kubrick and based on a short story by Brian Aldiss and a screen story by Ian Watson, \\"A.I.: Artificial Intelligence\\" has a fascinating premise and story. Kubrick turned the project over to Steven Spielberg when he realized it \\"fit\\" Spielberg's style of direction more than his own. Spielberg takes \\"A.I.\\" and turns it into a live action modern retelling of \\"Pinocchio\\" along with elements of Harlan Ellison's short story \\"Jeffity is Five\\" about an ageless little boy who--real or not--wants nothing more than to be loved for what he is.<br /><br />Playing like a more serious version of \\"E.T.\\", \\"A.I.\\" focuses on Monica and Henry Swinton (Francis O'Connor and Sam Robards)a couple who have a son in cryostatus because of an incurable disease. David (Haley Joel Osmond)a biomechanical humanoid with emotions is given to them by Doctor Hobby (William Hurt) to be a substitute for their son. When their real son returns home after a cure is found, David finds himself pushed out by a mother that cares for him enough NOT to want to have his memory destroyed but not enough to keep him. This sets him on an odyssey to find some way to become REAL and he meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a pleasure \\"mecha\\" searching for meaning with his own kind.<br /><br />\\"A.I.\\" did well enough at the box office but there's a fundenmental misunderstanding of the film because it is a collaboration between Spielberg and Kubrick two directors who's styles are polar opposites. Spielberg adopts some of Kubrick's stylistic approach and melds it to his own with \\"A.I.\\" (and he did so as well with his next project the Kubrickian \\"Minority Report\\" based on Philip K. Dick's short story). Those going into \\"A.I.\\" expecting an easy to digest adult version of \\"E.T.\\" were disappointed and those expecting a Kubrick film were as well.<br /><br />As good as Osmond is at portraying David the character comes across as needy early on which is difficult to make appealing. Osmond a talented actor does the best he can with the role and Spielberg might have benefited from collaborating with another writer to make the character a bit more appealing early on to audiences.<br /><br />At it's heart \\"A.I.\\" remains a story of a wooden boy who wants to be \\"emotionally\\" real and accepted. At the conclusion of the film, David gets his chance to at least momentarily experience the life denied to him when super advanced mecha--all that's left of humanity's brilliance--gives him the gift that he desires. Is it programming that drives him? It doesn't matter according to Spielberg because in our hearts we are ALL programmed to seek out acceptance and love to find a place where we belong even if only momentarily. The film is certainly flawed--it runs 20 minutes too long and the transition from the Kubrick elements of the story to the Spielberg are hardly seamless but, somehow, the film still manages to work.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a beautifully rendered 1080p transfer that nicely captures the theatrical look of the film. Keep in mind that Spielberg intended grainy look of this film so blame the director not the transfer if you don't like it. Audio likewise sounds beautiful with considerable detail sprinkled like pixie dust for each channel to envelope you in the experience.<br /><br />There's nothing new here in the area of the special features--all of the previous special features have been ported over for this edition. In a way that's good and bad news--while this isn't a bare bones presentation, it would have been nice to get something on the initial critical reaction of the film and it's reaction a decade later. The special features are presented in SD. The trailers however have been transferred from HD sources. Interestingly, the film which was released just three months before 9/11 acts as a mirror in terms of the tone of the nation and a featurette discussing this might have been interesting as well.<br /><br />Although \\"A.I.\\" is certainly flawed the film offers much food for thought in a modern retelling of \\"Pinocchio\\" by writer-director Steven Spielberg and producers Stanley Kubirck & Jan Harlan. Osmond's David comes across as an occasionally needy and whining character which does hamper the film some what. There are elements of both directors in this film and while they sometimes sit awkwardly next to each other the over all impact and emotional power of the film works well.<br /><br />Recommended.ussing this might have been interesting as well.<br /><br />Although \\"A.I.\\" is certainly flawed the film offers much food for thought in a modern retelling of \\"Pinocchio\\" by writer-director Steven Spielberg and producers Stanley Kubirck & Jan Harlan.

For the price and the brand associated with it, I though this might be possible.  Clearly I had not ventured into the \\"Lego partner-produced electronics for kids\\" arena before and was naïve.<br /><br />I get that it is a toy, but does it have to be such a mediocre, disappointing toy?  The image quality is truly horrible.  Basic functions, as simple as this camera is, are hard to use and poorly done.

It is a glued-together cheap knockoff of what might have been a decent product that Lego shouldn't be caught dead putting its name on.  On top of all that, there is no redeeming \\"Legoness\\" at all: no interesting use of the legos, no modularity or assembly, no hint of integration with any advanced lego functionality.  You can technically stick legos on the top and bottom, but they managed to mess even that up by using an odd alternation of widths across the bottom.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* low quality distorted plastic lens<br />* noisy, low-sensitivity primary sensor<br />* way over-compressed, causing horrible artifacts<br />* poor flash compensation causes blown-out photos<br />* no time & date clock, so all photos appear to have been taken March 8, 2008 at 3:30:30 pm.

B004L79VUI|5.0|The great rock Icon (rock guitarist, singer-songwriter, Hall of Famer), Robbie Robertson is back after a 10 year musical hiatus with his fifth great solo album, titled 'How To Become Clairvoyant'. The album is quite 'personal' to him as he speaks/explores his journey from leaving The Band in the track \\"This Is Where I Get Off\\"), about his youthful idealism in \\"When The Night Was Young\\", mysteries of magic/life in the title track \\"How To Become Clairvoyant\\" & has a duet with his legendary rock guitarist/singer & friend Eric Clapton for the first time on record in \\"Fear Of Falling\\". This great CD opens with a great blues track \\"Straight Down The Line\\" : great guitar/drum combination with the beautiful 'husky' voice of the great Canadian native, Robbie Robertson. Other great tracks include \\"Here Don't Live No More\\" (up-tempo rock track, great guitar/duet/harmonies), \\"The Right Mistake\\" (bluesy-rock track with great guitar/duet), \\"Fear Of Falling\\" (bluesy-rock track featuring Slow Hand/Eric Clapton on wonderful guitar & vocals, a great duet!), \\"Axman\\" (slow rhythm guitar bluesy track : a tribute to fallen great guitarists including Link Ray, Duane Allman & Jimi Hendrix), \\"How To Become Clairvoyant\\" (slow title track about the mysteries of magic) & \\"Tango For Django\\" (a great slow guitar, great instrumental track). My favourites/stand-outs/gems include \\"When The Night Was Young\\" (a beautiful laid-back rock track, great guitar/duet), \\"This Is Where I Get Off\\" (a wonderful laid-back track, great guitar/piano combination), \\"She's Not Mine\\" (slow guitar/piano track, great vocals : reminiscent of his classic track he did with Peter Gabriel \\"Fallen Angel\\"), \\"Madam X\\" (beautiful slow guitar, great instrumental track) & \\"Won't Be Back\\" (incredible guitar pickings & syncopation/improvisation). The album features musical greats : Eric Clapton, Steve Windwood (Traffic), Tom Morrello (Rage Against The Machine/ Audioslave), pedal steel savant Robert Randolph & Trent Reznor (Nine InchNails). Duets/vocals include the services of Angela McCluskey, Dana Glover, Rocco DeLuca & Taylor Goldsmith : adding to a great richness in backing vocals/duets/harmonies. There is no weak track on this great CD to really talk of. On overall, this is a great rock album by the great rock Icon Robbie Robertson (great guitar, vocals, duets & songwriting), worth the 10 years wait, a highly recommended CD listening.
B004M20YDU|5.0|Dave Cordes needs to listen to the album again.  The point of R3C0NF1GUR3D was not to sound like Daft Punk or try to outdo their work.  An attempt like that would be preposterous.<br /><br />I don't know if Cordes listens to a lot of remix material, or the groups or artists on this album, but I know that I do.  Probably over 80% of the music I listen to is in the electronica/remix genre.  This is exactly what I expected this album would sound like when it was announced, and this is exactly what electronic music is all about: taking stems of the masterworks and making them your own.<br /><br />I expected it to be like sitting in Caster's club when DJ's other than Daft Punk were in the booth mixing the soundtrack music, and that's what I got!  I think what Cordes may have missed is that you should expect each track to sound like the style of the artist who remixed it.<br /><br />1. Derezzed (Remixed by The Glitch Mob)<br /><br />Fantastic bass line that will definitely drop the floor in the club.  And it adds more power to an already powerful track. And the use of DP's original composition in the intro and in in the breaks is awesome.  Nicely interpreted track by the boys in the Glitch Mob.<br /><br />2. Fall (Remixed by M83 VS Big Black Delta)<br /><br />Being a big fan of the works of M83, I was not surprised by this track at all.  In fact, I was delightfully impressed by its originality.  This would fit in perfectly with anything M83 has ever done, yet would fit in with many of Daft Punk's deeper tracks.  That's exactly how it should be.<br /><br />3. The Grid (Remixed by The Crystal Method)<br /><br />The Crystal Method are experts at delivering intense beats, mystique, edge, breaking rhythm, and power to their music, and they do not disappoint here.  They even referenced their own music with the \\"You've got it\\" line ever so prevalent in 'High Roller'.  I love it when electronic musicians find a way to reference their own work.<br /><br />4. Adagio for TRON (Remixed by Teddybears)<br /><br />Raw electricity...from an Adagio! In music terminology adagio is to be played slowly.  But that doesn't mean it can't pack a punch.  This track does so well in mixing up the original that I forgot what the original sounded like until I went back and listened to it.  Dp's original is a fantastic orchestral adagio.  This track is a fantastic way to make it club-able.  They even took the organ line from the original and put it in a dance organ pad.<br /><br />5. The Son of Flynn (Remixed by Ki:Theory)<br /><br />Daft Punk's numeric, digitized, electronic lines of the original meet the only style I think they should meet: Rock!  We've heard Daft Punk mix their own robotic, drop-d tuning rock, and this just says \\"hey, we should do that again\\".<br /><br />6. C.L.U. (Remixed by Paul Oakenfold)<br /><br />I'll be honest, as a huge fan of Oakenfold, I was looking for something a bit more like his style, and less Hans Zimmer's.  But, Oakenfold has been working with Hans on a bunch of projects recently, so it isn't too surprising. To me this track has less layers and rhythmic quality than I am used to from perfecto.  Nonetheless, its a good listen.<br /><br />7. The Son of Flynn (Remixed by Moby)<br /><br />Again, I expected something different from Moby, more in line with his soft, jazz and downtempo moments.  But again, the original soundtrack has a lot of qualities in line with Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's compositional styles, and perhaps Moby and Oakenfold wanted to interpret that aspect more than the rave and breakbeat inspired influences in the soundtrack.  Which I am totally cool with.<br /><br />8. End of Line (Remixed by Boys Noize)<br /><br />When Caster requests a trance mix of \\"End of Line\\", this is what the DJ would play. This is a great mix, and is sure to end up on future trance and electronic music compilations.  I love that they sped up the tempo but kept a very heavy, hair raising original track at a similar power level.<br /><br />9. Rinzler (Remixed by Kaskade)<br /><br />What more can you expect from the masters of Kaskade?  This track is excellent!  Likely to be played in all kinds of places, including my workout playlist.  It naturally increases your blood pressure, so consult a doctor before listening and don't listen to it if you are prone to heart disease.<br /><br />10. Encom Part 2 (Remixed by Com Truise)<br /><br />Retro.  This mix sounds like it could have been done by Kraftwerk.  I was almost waiting for some German lyrics to arrive.  It's not as driving as some of the other tracks, and is very 80's-ish with 8 bit sounding synth pads.  But it does something unexpected at the end.  (Spoiler: at the end it wipes clean of the synths, and goes orchestral.  I love it when electronic musicians blend rock/techno beats with an orchestra.  I wish it would have done it for a longer duration.)<br /><br />11. End of Line (Remixed by Photek)<br /><br />If there is a track that nearly beats the original (but, like I said, they shouldn't be expected to and would be shameful if they did), this is the one.  Reverbed drum tracks, a heavy tempo like the original, and a hyper synth riff atop all of those digits combine to make a great track very reminiscent of the 80's and groups like Depeche Mode, genres like industrial and synthpop. (could mix in well with the last minutes of Frans Ferdinand's industrial showstopper remix of \\"Lucid Dreams\\" if anyone wants to try.  With the intro of the next track, you could keep the beat going.)<br /><br />12. Arena (Remixed by The Japanese Popstars)<br /><br />A good intro lends the ability of this track to get mixed in to just about any performance.  And who wouldn't want this as part of their set?  The breaks, with Safri-duo like drums, leads to the progressive inspired run that takes you on a fun, elecTRONic ride that never wants to slow, end, or stop repeating, building louder and stronger until the breakdown at the end.  All while incorporating the originality and excitement of what should be the Arena track from the motion picture.<br /><br />13. Derezzed (Remixed by Avicii)<br /><br />Admittedly poppy, but very danceable, this track would mixes in with ease like a Tiesto track would.  Frequently, electronic music takes on a more angry feel or minor tonality, but the major tone of this track, and its highly pixelated throbbing electronic rhythms give 'derezzing' a different perspective than the one that opened up the album.<br /><br />14. Solar Sailer (Remixed by Pretty Lights)<br /><br />I instantly loved the sound of Solar Sailer on the original soundtrack.  Taking after award winning electronic video game soundtracks like Deus Ex, DP did themselves many favors.  The remixer on this track simply adds to that, adding a bit more rock, electro, and breakbeats edge and influence to it.  I can almost hear an artist like Aaron Behrens screaming some awesome lyrics above it.  Maybe an idea for a future mashup?<br /><br />15. TRON Legacy (End Titles) (Remixed by Sander Kleinenberg)<br /><br />The Original End Titles track on the soundtrack was amazing, with its Vangelis inspired theme, is one that should only be carefully dealt with.  In any other track that I have heard remix a Vangelis theme, it is common that the theme is allowed to stand on its own (the remixer will tear down everything else).  Nothing is different here, and the added beats give it a drive worthy of its end title name.  Some of the first movie soundtrack quotations and references in electronic music were of Vangelis's Blade Runner soundtrack, and they included lines from the move, mixed and hashed up.  Kleinenberg obviously wanted to represent that type of artwork here in this remix that is very well done.  The original track definitely stands on its own, but when it finishes, I'll be sure it is followed up with this one.in all kinds of places, including my workout playlist.

B00002DE0S|5.0|This album is incomparably perfect in all respects!  Everything is as ideal as possible for a classical recording on CD technology:  orchestral conducting, pianism, musicianship, interpretation...  This album is the absolute crest of classical musicianship!
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I struggled to get through this book.  I kept thinking it would get better and it just didn't!  It was a tedious read & lacked depth.  The relationship between Diana & Matthew felt a little like reading about 2 teenagers.  The details were a little confusing at times were a little confusing to the storyline.  I plodded along, hoping the ending would tie all the details together and found that it was very anti-climactic.
0316069353|1.0|I was awating this new release.  But I refuse to pay more for an e-book that for a hardback, so I will just pass on both. At this rate I can wait sever months or so for the paperback.
B0015NORCS|3.0|Recording quality only fair for a 180 gram record. Original recording wasn't the best engineered work, but this issue is below the original. Also, too many clicks and pops for a new vinyl press.
B004KSQN7C|4.0|This is typical Britney with a dance flair. She's not a musician, she's an entertainer...I like to listen to almost every song on the album. Serious fans will love this album, average fans (like myself) will be highly pleased with the album. Definitely glad I got it.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|\\"A politician is someone who will double-cross that bridge when he comes to it\\" This film rightfully received the Academy Award for best documentary. It should be required viewing for everyone. It clearly explains and calls to task the companies, government representatives, academic involvement: all the liars and cheaters who helped bring our economy to its knees, played both sides to the middle and were knowingly complicit. It is unconscionable that no one has been held accountable or sentenced. Greed, our Achilles heel, is objectively revealed with a global perspective. See it!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love all the Angry Birds games and this one is no different. Lot of fun and easy to get started even if you have never played before. I'm a mom of 3, and I also love games that my kids can play. This qualifies :)
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I needed a small system to make appearances and this small Behringer Xenyx 802 is exactly what I needed to go with my two powered Polk Audio Hitmaster Monitors.  I have the perfect little system and it's small enough that I can carry everything in a suitcase and easy to set up.  I love my little Xenyx 802 Mixer Board!!!
0316069353|1.0|I agree with the comments about pricing!!!!!!   I have purchased a Kindle and am very pleased with the equipment.  However, pricing new releases on the same level as the hardback is nothing but price gouging!  Every one of the authors that most people read have new books out or ready to be released.  All are $12 to $14 on Kindle.  Is this now going to be the standard?  If so, put the Kindle away for a few months and wait till the price drops.
B004J4WQ46|1.0|I must say that Is This It and Room on Fire are two of my all-time favorite albums.  I can listen to every song on those two albums repeatedly and never get tired of them.  Having listened to Angles once, I am even more disappointed than I was when First Impressions came out. I actually struggled to listen to Angles all the way through because frankly the songs just suck. The songs just don't seem as well thought out and written as those on the first two albums, and the Strokes sound is completely gone.  I typically give albums I didn't like the first time around a second try, but seeing how painful it was to listen to it the first time, I think I will spare myself the disappointment again.  Give it a shot if you want, but if you are expecting or hoping anything close to the Strokes you love, you will be extremely disappointed, as I am.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have been a fan of Star Trek since I was a kid. I didn't see much of the original series since it was almost over before I was born. I started with Next Generation. I did watch all these original movies with my Dad, and some even in the theater at a young age. I bought this as a gift to my Dad for father's day. I was able to watch every movie with him again since my Mom didn't want to watch these with him. Pretty good quality for older movies. He was pleased with the movies as well. I can't speak to any differences in the movies as others reviewers have stated since I haven't seen any other release of these movies.
0316067938|1.0|I'm not taking the time to write a lengthy review here. People have already said it all. Really.<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm curious to see how and if they are going to make a movie out of this book. I can't imagine anyone liking it or how any film maker could attempt such an amazing feat as to turn it into something that anyone would even remotely like!<br /><br />I guess this book has that much going for it. It's like a train wreck... hard to look away. Of course I wouldn't spend a dime to see the movie if there was one. I's wait till I can watch it online instantly from Netflix or Amazon.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is loads of fun and very frustrating at the same time if you are trying to get all 3 stars on each level. I have finally completed every level with 3 stars and completed all 22 golden egg levels. I have version 1.5.3. I installed the updated version when I had 1.5.2 and it did not delete my progress.<br /><br />If you haven't played the game or head about it, it is simple. Pigs stole eggs from birds so now they are angry and trying to get the eggs back. Each level you slingshot your birds to wipe out the piggies. You get several different birds to help including a red bird to knock things over, a blue bird that splits into 3 and breaks glass, a yellow bird that torpedos and breaks wood, a white bird that drops egg bombs, a bomb bird that explodes (good for stones), a giant red bird that breaks a lot of stuff, and a yellow boomerang bird that can go backwards.<br /><br />Great game. Now that I have completed it, on to Seasons or Rio.<br /><br />UPDATE: I now have version 1.6.3 which adds level 6 (Mine and Dine) with 45 more boards and some new Golden Eggs. The levels are in a Mine and some of them are very challenging but I managed to get 3 stars in all the levels. Still one of my favorite games on my phone.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I love Michael Connelly, have read all his books except this one. Will not be purchasing this since the publisher decided to price the Kindle version higher than the retailers are pricing the hardcover. I know this will do no good but a point has to be made nonetheless.
B004UNB1R4|5.0|In 1967 The Band and Dylan recorded what came to be called the Basement Tapes which included the hauntingly beautiful  \\"Going Down the Road to see Bessie Smith\\" (sang by Robinson). To my ears this album captures the spirit of this song more than any thing that the Band or Robertson have done since then. Much of the music is dedicated to events that took place in Robinson's distant past including \\"This which is where I get Off\\" that chronicles the  breakup of \\"The Band) and \\"He Don't Live here on more\\" which is perhaps inspired by the suicide of Richard Manual.    Clapton's guitar playing is superb (he plays on six of the 12 tracks) and is reminiscent of his playing in the 1970's on his  albums \\"Slow Hand\\" and \\"No Reason to Cry\\". Robertson singing is as alive as it was in 67.     The album contains two instrumentals - one being Madam X (penned by Clapton) and the other being  \\"Tango for Django\\" are both exceptional.     One Last thing, if you do not have the afore mentioned \\"Bessie Smith\\" and you like Robertson it is a must have.

B002SJKWZ4|5.0|Don't be mistaken, the 3 starts that I gave the wand for ease of operation is not a bad thing, it's a great thing!  If you are a true Harry Potter fan than this is the perfect wand for you!  It requires true talent and honing of your craft.  The wand itself is very sensitive and responds to the perfect casting of spells.  You can't just thrust the wand in the general movement and hope that it works, you have to actually learn the gesture and master it.  I'm not saying it's impossible to do, it just requires a slight level of practice.    I personally loved it, and so did my brother, whom I got this wand for.  We are both huge Harry Potter fans and let me just say that the amount of will it took me to not open the gift before I actually gave it to him is to be admired (in my opinion :] ).  So if you're looking for something that makes you feel like a true wizard and not just a wannabe, then THIS IS IT.  Don't hesitate at the price, it's only a number, you can worry about the financial stuff later. This was the perfect gift and to see the excitement on my (22 year old!) brother's face was absolutely priceless.    In addition to the wand itself, the box that it came was perfect as well.  So if you're on the fence about this wand, GET IT.  I promise, you won't regret it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|From page one Mockingjay's structure differs from that of the first two books and while that should have provided me with a read that didn't get stale instead it provided me the ability to read between the lines: when Collins isn't stringing you along page to page her prose is BORING. In the other books Katniss is a world weary, but still strong, female character and in this one it seems as though she regresses in age and becomes whiny and pathetic. I wanted to feel bad for Katniss, she has been through a lot until this point, but instead Collins made me care less about what happened to her.<br /><br />I was told by a friend that the book was sad but I found (Book 1 spoiler ahead) Rue's death far more sad than anything else that happened in the series.<br /><br />In general I found the whole of this book disappointing and it soured me on the series. It is still better than some books out there and if you've read the first two you'll be reading this. Just don't expect the world and maybe, just maybe, you won't be disappointed.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This documentary unraveled many fragile elements of the spider web of criminal abuse and greed that we have come to know by its almost acceptable name - the 2008 Wall Street crash.  The film introduced viewers to world banking trustees, who clearly saw the debacle coming, the CEOs of the Wall Street corporations, who made mega millions pre-crash, ran their companies into the ground, and then got tapped for high-ranking jobs in the government, the regulating entities and the consultants from academia, who signed off on ill-conceived, unscrupulous methods and received hefty consultant fees as a result.  This film captures the arrogance, greed, and criminal abuse of the individuals and companies involved, providing a comprehensive look at the what, why, and who of this event........and I didn't even get to the strippers and prostitutes yet.

B004NS710C|1.0|I install my Roku on 4/3/11 and ordered three movies including Unstoppable.  Amazon sends me receipts showing it charged me for all three movies. I download all three movies to my Video Library on 4/3/11, but don't watch Unstoppable that night. So I go back today (4/4/11) to watch Unstoppable.  Big Problem: The other two movies show up in my Video Library folder on the Roku and on Amazon, but Unstoppable has disappeared from my Video Library in both places.  No problem right? Just go to Amazon and click for help, right?  WRONG!!  No place to click for a return or refund. No FAQ addresses this issue.  No way to timely notify Amazon THAT I CAN'T WATCH THE GODDAMN MOVIE BEFORE THE 48-HOURS RUN OUT!  No way to ask for a refund.  I guess when you pay your money for a movie and their computer hiccups, you're just screwed.  Gee Amazon, I've been you're biggest fan.  How could you screw it up so badly?

B00498YZH8|5.0|Wow!  I just rented this video here on Amazon, and I am absolutely, one hundred percent blown away.  I'd been meaning to watch it since the Oscars, and Jennifer Lawrence's recent casting in the Hunger Games finally prompted me to rent it in order to see if she could convincingly portray Katniss Everdeen, who is near and dear to my heart.  Suffice it to say that she can.  But I won't talk about the Hunger Games here... this review is about Winter's Bone, which I can say without hesitation is one of the most superb films I have seen in years.    Other reviewers have written beautiful summaries of the plot and the setting, so I won't repeat them here.  Frankly, I'm much better at reviewing books than movies (and you'd better believe that I'll be reading the book ASAP!)  All I can really say is that this movie left my head spinning, my stomach churning, and my heart racing - how the writer and director managed to do that using such slow pacing, minimal plotting and spare settings, I will never know.  What I do know is that I have never been so terrified by something so completely realistic and authentic.  There is no sensationalism here.  This is a dead-on portrayal of certain aspects of rural life (some of which I've seen myself in my hometown, and have trouble explaining to people who think that rural life is always quaint and pleasant.)  The line that Ree has to walk between saving her nuclear family and proving her loyalty to her father's relatives is harrowing, and her survival depends upon her ability to walk that line.  That is, I believe, what ultimately lends the film its horrific depth, because it is not a traditional thriller.  By the climax of the movie, which involves a boat ride into a swamp in the middle of the night, I had my hand over my mouth to keep from screaming out loud.  The brilliant thing is that Jennifer Lawrence's face was showing the exact same emotion - watching Ree fight back her horror, I felt like I was being willed to scream and break onher behalf.    Jennifer Lawrence is a truly magnificent actress.  Having seen her in interviews, I cannot believe that an actress with such a bubbly personality could portray this guarded, secretive, desperate, and terrifying character.  Yet part of what made her performance powerful were the moments when she slipped back into the role of little girl, and we were reminded that Ree was only 17.  The scene with the army recruiter and the scene at the police station were standouts in this regard - I got goosebumps watching her sit in the police station holding a bag of you-know-what, and wearing the expectant, happy expression of an ordinary teenager.  Even simple acts such as teaching the younger kids how to shoot or make deer stew (\\"a little bit of survival,\\" as Ree puts it) were tremendously poignant.  She melted my heart in nearly every frame of the film.  Ree's destiny, unfortunately, seems predetermined, but I can't pity her, because her spirit and heart are way too big to merit anyone's pity.    During the Oscars this year, I was all about Black Swan and really wanted Natalie Portman to win the award for best actress.  This is hard for me to say, but after watching Winter's Bone, I believe that Jennifer Lawrence should have received the award, hands down.  I have learned a valuable lesson about seeing ALL of the movies before making any judgments.  I'm consoled by the certainty that Jennifer will receive many an Oscar nomination in the future.    Finally, to touch briefly on the Hunger Games (I'm sorry, but I can't resist...)  If anyone is reading these reviews to see if Jennifer can pull off the role of Katniss, rest assured that this girl is pretty much Katniss incarnate.  I honestly believe that she was born to play the role, and I can't think of anyone else who would be more deserving or who will be more believable.  Gary Ross has said that casting Jennifer in the role was the easiest casting decision of his life, and I can well believe it.  I'm glad that he went with a serious actress for the film and I am ecstatic that he chose Jennifer.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Loved this movie!  You have to watch this movie by knowing it's very, very different.  You are watching Nina's life through her eyes.  Nina is a very stressed, mentally ill individual.  From my point of view, and I am not a psychiatrist by no means, I believe Nina is Schizophrenic.  Natalie Portman's character is the correct age for when mental illness shows up in people, and the stress she places upon herself and endures from others around her agitates her illness and brings it to light.    So many storylines show the treatment of mentally ill individuals, as in how those around the mentally ill person view the behaviors but don't show how the mentally ill suffer through their own eyes.  Kudos to the cinematographers, film editors, screenwriter, and director who all worked on this movie.  Fabulous job.
B0041T4O9Y|5.0|I found William Kamkwamba's story to be a great one. I first heard of this on Ted Talks<br /><br />(see: [...])<br /><br />and was inspired to read the book. It was an amazing sory and I think the book is also an impressive read BUT I do think however that the ratings of 2 here have valid points you should consider and be aware of. These claims/criticisms are not merely about a bad delivery or damaged product - but they look at possible flaws with this whole story.<br /><br />Nonetheless - I still find the story an interesting one, and my Engineering students find it inspirational so would not steer you away from it. If you do indeed find that the claims here do not add up it would make this even more interesting should one day a hoax be revealed. The story is still good.
B004FHBO9K|5.0|I purchased the limited edition clear vinyl edition of this soundtrack. I haven't listened to it yet, since I'm hesitant to make a collector's item \\"used\\", but I've listened to my friend's collector's edition and it was absolutely amazing.   Crisp, clean sound and it's definitely a unique record, considering they're clear. They're the only two clear ones I have and didn't even know there was such thing as a clear record until now lol.    Regardless, you won't be disappointed with this purchase.
0521707803|3.0|Nice book and it can be very valuable, but when instructing with collocations I tend to select examples that arise during a given course, rather than making a course out of it. Using Collind Coubuild online (or any other online site) can do more than this book - going online makes the process student-centered and more active.<br /><br />I do however see this book as a useful reference to be used from time to time. I simply feel that collocations are better illustrated via online searching and discovery. One strength I guess is that the book goes beyond the word level and has students see patterns in language - and for this it gets a 4-5.
0525951652|1.0|What a disappointment this novel was...especially after truly enjoying Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  Immediately noticeable was the apparent dumbing down of the prose itself. The language was Dick and Jane.  The dozens of characters were clichéd along the lines of nationalistic stereotypes and their chance meetings all over two continents were beyond the boundaries of kismet. After investing a few hundred pages in hopes of a literary redemption of some sort, I had to hold 'em or fold 'em.  I regretfully held 'em for another 700 pages.  I understand that this is the first in a trilogy. I will not read the others.
0312430000|5.0|What if someone invented an algorithm that would dramatically improve stock market  returns or a sophisticated medical device that dramatically improves meical success rate, or a new aircraft engine that reduced accident rates by half. Would be the world be to flocking to pay billions to get that shiny new silver bullet.     New what if all the above success can be achieved without any of the shiny new inventions but something far more humble, mundane, and something far more inexpensive. This is exactly what the author goes on to demonstrate. The humble lowly tool is our good old checklist. The author demonstrates with great persuasion through well researched evidence across industries and his own experiences that this is very much possible. In fact, the airline industry uses it all the time with great results.     If it were so simple and inexpensive  and yet can produce dramatic results, , why isn't it everyone using it ? Because, as with most things in life, success often depends not on that shiny new gadget but on plain old fashioned discipline.     The genius of the author Atul Gawande is not only in demonstrating that Checklists can be so effective  but also his brilliant presentation. The book reads more like a fast paced thriller and not a boring process improvement guide. All of us can benefit from it. And enjoy it too.  Atul Gawande is a great story teller and definitely and the  author to watch out for.
014017821X|3.0|This was a mixed bag for me. A variety of fairy tale retellings, some were great, a few left me scratching my head and wondering what the hell..., others just bored me. I would have liked to have a wider variety of tales retold as a couple of stories were different views on same tale (Red Riding Hood Beauty & the Beast are overdone IMHO) but overall, it was interesting to read these short stories. Also, Carter'svarious styles are fascinating to wade through and the language was often sumptous and very stylized to the specific interpretation. For that alone, I enjoyed it!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I hate this app. I don't use it and its pre-installed on my EVO 4G taking memory that I could use on something I actually want. I don't appreciate how Amazon is forcing people with the EVO to have their apps on our phone. I use the Amazon mobile app and the appstore which I like but I'd appreciate it if Kindle and Amazon MP3 be able to be uninstalled from my phone. thanks
0307454541|4.0|This books begins a little slow because the author takes time developing characters.  It is worth the wait. There are many twist and turns. I will definitely read the series. If you want to read something with depth, this is it.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|To understand this movie you have to pay attention to the people in it. All the characters in the brothel scenes are there in the asylum scenes but changed. The girls, except for Sweet Pea, are at a table in front. The mayor is the guard with the lighter when Baby Doll is brought in. This is a fun and interesting movie which rewards the attention you pay to it. No one really died. I would enjoy a sequel. Maybe Baby Doll can heal herself. Its all a matter of will.

0618001905|4.0|I recently read this book for a World History course and was surprised when I actually found the book interesting. The book reads like a novel but a novel with historically accurate information. For someone with little to no background information on the subject matter explored in the book, I have no hesitation when I say it was thoroughly enjoyable and (gasp!) informative at the same time. This book is a testament to the fact that not all books that contain historically accurate information have to be like a typical boring history textbook.
B004TL0J5M|1.0|I was immensely looking forward to the latest installment of the Haller novels by Connelly, checking back and forth the news on the authors website. Having purchased a Kindle gave me an opportunity, being from Europe, to own the book on a sort of firsthand basis. But seeing the pricetag! More than the paperback price? That struck me as a sort of scam. I refuse to buy the book at that price.
0316069353|1.0|I'm sure this is a great book - he's a wonderful writer.  But I give it one star for the Kindle price.  How else can I protest, other than not buying (and I won't - I'll find a Barnes and Noble and read it in the aisle if I have to.)

1594202842|5.0|This is a great, easy read and very inspiring. I think it is important for American's to see that there is another way raising of children, opposite from our lenient, over indulgent, and sometimes \\"wimpy\\" parenting (or not parenting however you look at it). Though some of the author's methods and tactics appear to be \\"over the top\\" regarding practicing musical instruments, her daughters had great success and appear to be thriving. Kids need to be challenged and we do them a disservice if we don't.. There is a lot to be learned from this book and I am glad the author shared this story.

Not a first or only choice, but a fine supplement by a legendary conductor of Wagner.

B004L79VUI|3.0|Real tasty guitar work- a good comeback. Hands down the most commercial thing he's done since his 1st solo 1987 LP. The one drawback is it sounds like it was made in late 1980's. A bit over-produced. One could listen to Clapton's JOURNEYMAN & Bonnie Raitt's NICK OF TIME back to back and hear the similarities; both in production and arrangements (possibly due to the album being recorded in London w/Clapton on over half the tracks). It doesn't have a contemporary edge the way, say Tom Petty's, Neil Young's, or Paul Simon's albums have had the last decade or so. If your looking for a companion to THE BAND's vibe...stick with LEVON HELMs last few albums.
0316098337|5.0|It is rare that you read a book that is original and much of this book was exactly that. I was a little nervous it would all be graphic or horrible in some way when I realized it was abut a woman held against her will in a room but the book really is not focused on the past nor does it focus on sensationalism instead it really looks at the resilience of the human spirit. The story focuses on how this woman and her child manage after they leave room. It really is interesting and I could barely put it down. Hat's off to the writer, well done at a original and thought provoking book.
0316056863|5.0|I love Tina Fey. From SNL to 30 Rock to Sarah Palin impersonations to Megamind, she has continued to impress me, not only as a comedian, but as a writer and thoughtful entertainer as well.<br /><br />Bossypants is an honest and hilarious memoir by one of New York's 50 Most Powerful Women (NY Post). This is not a Hollywood tell-all, but an engaging and interesting behind-the-scenes look at an \\"achievement-oriented, drug-free, adult virgin\\" (3). Fey admits, these are \\"lurid tales of anxiety and cowardice\\" (4). And many of them are gut wrenching!<br /><br />Though this book is honest, it often reads like one joke after another. The reader may still feel distanced from the real Tina Fey after reading Bossypants, but I think the opposite is true. The constant humor, the one-liners, the self-deprecation is who she really is, which makes her writing and comedy work.<br /><br />Fey's chapter entitled \\"A Childhood Dream, Realized,\\" in which she recounts her first meeting with Lorne Michaels and the beginnings of her career at SNL, is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />This is a fun and funny book. Enjoy.

B002ZG976U|3.0|I've read some of the other reviews here and much as I like Cher, Christina and Stanley Tucci, it must be said that they do their best with surprisingly trite material.  I've seen a lot of comparisons to CHICAGO here but there are other musicals which this clearly aspires to equal but it never makes it.  Those are MOULIN ROUGE, DREAMGIRLS, STAR IS BORN, CABARET and FUNNY GIRL.  This film is closer to DREAMGIRLS on what it attains than any of the others.  The others have better scriots and better music.  They all share the girl who starts out with nothing but her raw talent, gets a break and becomes a sensation. Will success ruin her and her falling in love with her true love?<br /><br />There is nothing new in this story and it is not as well presented as it was in the other above named musicals.  Also, you will not leave the theater humming the music you heard in the show for the next week.<br /><br />If the script was removed and instead this became a performance film with the two leads, I would probably give it at least one more star. I found myself waiting for the musical numbers because the.script was so derivative and bad.<br /><br />Why do so many viewers like it then?  One certainly is compelled to say that Christina Aguilera gives this her all.  We always knew she was a great singer but here she also shows she can dance and act.  I would love to see her in a better musical vehicle.  Cher, of course, is always marvelous too and she doesn't disappoint here as the woman who owns the theater and gives the girl her break.  Stanley Tucci is her marvelous gay best friend.  Two men are the love interests.  The nice one is indeed very attractive.  The creep is yes, a creep.  There is nothing new or dynamic that they add to the film and it might have added something to put in men with some musical talent instead.  All those criticizing CHICAGO fail to mention that Richard Gere did great dance sequences and John C Reilley did a great musical number, CELLOPHANE.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

193413712X|5.0|tinker: n a: a usu. itinerant mender of household utensils  b: an unskillful mender: bungler    In Paul Harding's debut novel, Tinkers, three generations of men, grandfather, father, son, try to make sense of life.  Howard is the bridge between his father, a Methodist preacher turned inchoate mystic, and his son, George Washington Crosby, a maker of clocks and handy at any and every household task.      We meet George, lying on his deathbed at the book's beginning.  All of his efforts to shore up his house and provide security for his family have come to naught.  He hallucinates, \\"he saw insects running in and out of imaginary cracks in the ceiling plaster...Pollen and sparrows, rain and the intrepid squirrels he had spent half of his life keeping out of the bird feeders would breach the house.\\"    Harding's narrative swings back and forth between George, and his father, Howard, an epileptic and a tinker by both definitions.  Howard's father's parishioners have the preacher sent away, presumably to an asylum, after he delivers a sermon they find incomprehensible.  It is at this point, nearly three-quarters of the way through the book, that the third-person POV switches to Howard's first-person account of events.  My attention, which had been proceeding in a sort of hypnotic lull through Harding's lovely meandering prose, suddenly became riveted.  \\"I should say that the sermons my father gave on Sundays were bland and vague.\\"  But here is what Howard hears, delivered in a voice reminiscent of Whitman's:    O, Senator, drop your trousers!  Loosen your Cravat!  Eschew your spats and step into that shallow, teeming world of mayflies and dragonflies and frogs' eyes staring eye-to-eye with your own, and the silty bottom.  Cease your filibuster against the world God gave you.    Howard retreats to the wild to ponder his father's fate.  What follows is one of the book's most beguiling scenes.  (\\"The sunken halves of his legs stand buried in the silt among hidden branches and stones, which, because they are invisible, feel somehow like bones.\\")  Howard decides to spend the night submerged up to the neck in a pond,    Sometime, after midnight, I saw another head on the water, partially obscured by the grass overgrowing the bank...It was an Indian...When the head's mouth opened, almost before the fish had even broken the surface of the stream, it made a hole, into which the dark water smoothly flowed.  Although the head was far away, I was certain I heard the echo of water funneling down its throat in the instant before the fish leapt.  When the fish leapt, it was not like the normal rise of a fish striking a mayfly; the fish, unlikely, impossible, invisible itself, its existence only traced by the water from which it emerged, jumped directly down the Indian's throat.    Howard wakes to discover he has been rescued by a pair of white hunters.  While he sits at the hunters' camp, he remembers the Indian who came to fix his father's canoe,    After glancing away for a moment to look at the first robin of spring, I looked back at the canoe and the Indian had vanished without a sound, without, seemingly, even movement, but, rather, had been reabsorbed back not only into trunk and root, stone and leaf but into light and shadow and season and time itself.    Howard is not only the bridge between his father and his son, the mystic and the horologist, but between nature and modernity, between the 19th and 20th centuries.  Harding shows us that we are all life's tinkerers.  Our small modifications to Life's mechanism are incapable of altering its course.  Life simply carries on--tock, tock, tock.    With such rich imagery and symbolism that before I was even finished, I wanted to turn back to the beginning to seek out fresh insights, Tinkers carries the tradition of Hawthorne and Melville, Thomas Wolfe and Jack London into the 21 century.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|I am a HUGE Luc Besson fan, his cinemaphotography is fantastic, ie The Big Blue, La Femme Nikita, Leon (The Professional) and this more recent film holds true to his style of film making. The story is engaging, a true masterpiece! Scott
B003L77TZI|3.0|The CD was in great shape,BUT,I was hoping to put the CD on my Computer which I did,but for some reason the CD wasn't recognized to put the titles on my Ipod,it was listed as a unknown CD...and I am unable to hear it consistenly I have to manually play each song...
B0041KKYEM|3.0|This is definitely a film worth seeing. More for the performances, as this is an actor's and director's showcase. The film is actually quite thin and undercooked from a narrative standpoint. The visuals can be entertaining and there are some incredibly tense moments, but the film is light on suspense or any nuanced emotion. Yes, Natalie Portman's character, Nina, does show a lot in terms of emotion on a broad scale, but it is mainly at one end or the other because it is what the story allows. I think if you watch this film simply expecting entertainment, you will come out with more than you bargained for and you will NOT be disappointed.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|Inspired song choices, a rootsy urban bluegrass vibe and some really good instrumentalists. An album to enjoy and yes, joyful.
B004B32500|3.0|I have always been a fan of Jodorowsky and seen him as a visionary. I was never able to agree with those who spoke over fraught hype; however, this film left me a bit cold. There are moments of true cinematic wonder, i.e., the elephant funeral. It really is amazing how a film can connect with so many on such a deep level, then not for others. But this film, while it gets off the ground, never soared for me.
B0045U9WPU|5.0|This book started out a little slow but then it really picked up after about 150 pages. I read the last 250 in one sitting. The ending made me cry, I'm not even sure why. I guess since we don't get that much of a closure; although, I'm pretty sure that Alex would have been killed for the stunts he pulled helping Lena escape. And that Lena strives in the wilds. It just hit me that there were so many things that were not said at the end. But that is what adds to this book, and that is what makes int truly amazing.     This should definitely be made into a movie!!!!
B003XDZMPY|5.0|I am a fan of Crocs and have had many pairs.  This is the first or second pair I have bought for my wife and the fit, confort level and pricing are all great...especially through Amazon.  They have had the very best pricing, and with Prime shipping...wow...a great deal!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This has become my favorite adult friendly kid movie. Very much in the style of the Royal Tennenbaums in humor and creatively done (doesn't follow the book exactly). The way the animation is done is interesting and not the same CGI that we are always looking at nowadays. The kids have watched it over and over and I have found myself sitting down with them on more than one occasion to watch it too instead of grabbing those much needed minutes of me time :)
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I have watched every episode of this series and ive got to say i really enjoyed it,the show of course has its detractors,now im no expert on tudor history but most of the complaints were about historical inaccuracies and how joanathan rhys meyers good lookin lad that he is,dose not look like henry VIII,well my only idea of old henry is that famouse portriat of him that hangs in hampton court palace and to be honest i dont know how accurate that is lol,any way if your a passionate history buff of tudor times you may not like this and i get that,however if you like a good drama,costume drama or soap if you like,you will like this,i enjoyed the plot twists and turns character portrayals and winced at the thought of some of the totures the tudors inflicted on those who fell foul of them,so all in all a fabulous costume drama and even the wife watched it with me though i think it was more to do with mr rhys meyers than being with me.

0525422943|5.0|**Spoilers - if you have not read If I Stay, the summary/review for this book will contain spoilers.  And just as a side note, go get yourself a copy of If I Stay asap for you are truly missing out.**<br /><br />If I Stay was one of my favorite reads from 2009.  In it, we met Mia, a very talented cellist who has a terrible car accident and has to make a tough decision between life and death.<br /><br />In Where She Went we learn that it's been three years since that fateful accident.  Adam was Mia's boyfriend at the time of the accident and since then there have been a lot of changes.  First and foremost, he and Mia are no longer together (shocker!).  Since their break-up his band has had worldwide success and is at the top of the charts.  All that he knows about Mia is that she left to school in New York and never looked back.  He knows why she stayed... he just doesn't understand where she went...<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I have looked forward to this book.  I fell in love with Mia in If I Stay, but Where She Went made me fall in love with Adam.  God, he was such a tormented soul.  His separation from Mia was devastating - even though this same devastation caused him to become a very famous rock star.  His voice was so unique, albeit heartbreaking and achingly sorrowful.  I especially loved that we get snippets of the lyrics to Adam's songs at the beginning of each chapter.. they were haunting.<br /><br />Once again, Ms. Forman has chapters that alternate between the present and the past told entirely through Adam's point-of-view.  Using this technique we get small glimpses of what went wrong... why Mia left and how Adam came to be the broken soul that he is today.<br /><br />The writing is raw and strong and is so infused with grief and pain that I felt my heart at my throat the whole time reading it.... you know, that feeling you get when you want to sob but don't actually break down... yea, that one.  Mia and Adam are so imperfect that they are perfect.  I laughed, I cried... I might have even sobbed a little.<br /><br />If you've read If I Stay then you know it ended perfectly.  But this sequel will bring you closure.  It will leave you feeling hopeful and all warm and toasty inside - you'll also find a big goofy grin on your face at its closure. I loved it!  It was definitely worth the wait.have even sobbed a little.     If you've read If I Stay then you know it ended perfectly.  But this sequel will bring you closure.

0756404738|5.0|Once again we return to the Waystone Inn to hear more about the fantastical life of the not-so-old innkeeper.  Patrick Rothfuss has built a supremely detailed world and peopled it with a cast of characters befitting an epic fantasy.  However, it isn't the same epic fantasy you will read elsewhere.  The tale narrated by the main character is really just the true story of his own life, with the ups and downs, laughs and follies, wrong turns and triumphs one can expect of a coming of age story.  I do not say this is one of the best fantasy books I've read in a long time, instead I say it is one of the best novels.  Kudos to Mr. Rothfuss, it was well worth the wait...

While they are stuck in Room, the book is a little redundant (obviously as how much could one do in a room) and slightly creepy (the kid is 5 and gets breastfed all the time).      SPOILER ALERT!    Once they escaped i felt very annoyed with the kid as he had so many questions and couldnt adjust to normal life.

0316069353|5.0|This engaging courtroom thriller is by far Mr. Connelly's best Lincoln Lawyer tale to date! This time Mickey Haller has jumped on the foreclosure bandwagon and is servicing clients who are about to lose their house. One of those clients is Lisa Trammel who has started a protest group that against her bank that garners national attention.    When the Bank Officer servicing Lisa's loan is murdered, Lisa is the prime suspect and it is up to Mickey to defend her. Through the handling of Lisa's mortgage case against the bank, Mickey knows that there were a lot of \\"fishy\\" practices going on and that Lisa may have been set up. The courtroom drama is intense and Mr. Connelly has the reader hooked on every sentence of the narrative.    Mr. Connelly also paints a picture of LAPD law enforcement (with the exception of Harry Bosch) working with \\"tunnel vision,\\" meaning that once they have a possible suspect, they ignore all leads not related to the suspect and only pursue what will make a case against that suspect. This may in part be due to the economics of doing an investigation. The prosecution in this case seems to only be interested in seeing the accused go down and to discount any other \\"theories\\" of what may have occurred, especially if those paths may point to a different individual as the perpetrator of the crime.    Mr. Connelly  also gives us more insight into Mickey's supporting team, especially his investigator Cisco. Mickey seems to have evolved from the \\"sleezy\\" lawyer we had seen in the first Lincoln Lawyer novel and is now a relentless pursuer of getting to the truth. There are also some surprises with Mickey's evolving \\"post-married\\" relationship with Maggie, his ex.    I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish and look forward to more Mickey stories!
B0028RXHCG|5.0|I installed the [[ASIN:B0028RXHCG Intel Core 2 Duo Processor E7600 3.06GHz 3 MB LGA775 CPU, Retail BX80571E7600]] CPU to upgrade my wife's computer (HP/Compaq dc7700) and soon realized that I would have to update the BIOS and Microcode versions on the motherboard (chipset Intel Q965).  Luckily, the firmware is available from the HP website.  If you are going to upgrade an older machine then I highly recommend updating the firmware before installing this CPU.  And don't forget to purchase a thermal compound such as Arctic Silver 5.  Using a thermal compound between the CPU and heat sink will avoid burning up and destroying your brand new CPU in a few seconds...    Also, I bought the faster CPU because I replaced the older Windows XP (32-bit) operating system with the newer Windows 7 (64-bit) and wanted to boost performance.  I am happy to report that after installing the CPU and additional memory ([[ASIN:B0027P9C9G Corsair TWIN2X4096-6400C5C 4GB XMS2 PC2-6400 800Mhz 240-pin Dual Channel DDR2 Desktop Memory]]) the system's performance has drastically improved!

B004289ZW0|4.0|Well with all the awesome reviews I was excited to try this with my Ipad. I use Foreflight for a tool while flying my airplane. The only hesitation was all the complaints about trying to turn it off. Well after a few times of working it i found that the times that it doesn't respond is when I am too agressive with my swiping motion. I found that if you just slightly touch and swipe at a medium speed it works 99% of the time. Actually after I found the touch, I can sit here and turn it off and on 10 to 15 times in a row without a miss. So the more frustrated you get the worse it will probably get. I am now very happy with it and look forward to going flying tomorrow to play with my new toy. I didn't want the one that plugged into the Ipad for 2 reasons. 1). I was concerned that if i drop the  pad it could break off. 2). I wouldn't be able to charge my Ipad while it was plugged in.

0452289963|4.0|It feels a little strange to be writing a review of this book. After all, wouldn't Tolle have all of us believing that we shouldn't pass judgment? The book is what it is, right?    Well, I suppose I haven't evolved enough, on Tolle's terms. I still crave to critique, even after reading both this book and Eckhart Tolle Inc.'s first blockbuster, the Power of Now.     But if Tolle cared what I think about his work, which he apparently doesn't, he would be happy to know that I consider myself an admirer, as a fellow capitalist.    This is a writer who has very few, if any, original ideas, but he has done a masterful job of repackaging Buddhism for the mass market in America. He even goes so far as to sprinkle his books with Jesus quotations, in a clever attempt to fool Christians into thinking that they're getting something other than Eastern philosophy.    Although I might be distracted by the sound of the cash registers at Eckhart Tolle Inc. World Headquarters, I still give our wise elf four stars for making a genuine and appealing effort to describe the Truth.    Who can argue, as he says in \\"A New Earth,\\" that \\"on this planet, `normal' equals insane?''    I sincerely hope he's right that humanity is evolving toward greater consciousness. But looking around me, I have some serious doubts.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Its one of the greatest shows I ever saw. I watched the first season almost non-stop. Brilliant characters and the plot is fascinating.

B001Q1QF2O|5.0|I am not in Lily Allen's target audience. But I have been listening to all kinds of music for most of my 70 years.<br /><br />Most singers are lucky if they ever record a perfect album where every song is excellent. In my humble opinion It's not me, it's you is that album. There is not one filler song on the entire collection. The arranging is creative, slick and could not be better. Lily's performance is mature beyond her years. It style is poignant, personal, brutal, fresh. The lyrics are simple but direct. I love her questions about god, her western send up of It's Not Fair with its biting lyrics sung so sweetly. Every song in this collection is addicting.<br /><br />I read that Lily may not record again. If this is true, she will be one of the very few who quit while they were ahead. And in this case, way out in front.<br /><br />I'm going to stop listening to this collection of songs now so it can always remain perfect in my mind.
B004K4IZ54|2.0|Ok first the good stuff great sound good 3d and if your a Tron fan you will probably enjoy it.For the rest of us the movie is dark all the way through there is  no in your face 3d to speak of story line will put you to sleep wait for 2hours and then your treated to one good scene I wont tell you and ruin it I would recomend it only if your a big fan.
B003EYVXSW|1.0|DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! I sat and watched and like I always do I have to finish a movie I start. I like Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley but when they decided to add the sex scene, rape scene and Sarah's character pregnant. Come On! I wish I could get that image removed from my memory. I overlooked the strange creatures they created that fight near the beginning of the movie. It was way overdone and I should have just stop watching it then.
B00475AYJQ|1.0|Having enjoy Patrick Rothfuss's first book I was eagerly waiting for this The wise man's fear. Unfortunately it is more tedious and dreary than the first and drags on with minuscule details that I can not believe anyone would want to transcribe for historical interest. Nothing much happens except more whining from Kvothe and little of how come he is to be so famous and noteworthy. I am not sure what type of novel he was writing, but it was not the kind of novel I was wanting to read. I will be taking him off my list of authors to read. I could care less what happens next.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD, including its three levels, kicks butt, especially for beginners/intermediate exercisers.  Jillian Michael's 20 mins segments make you collect a pool of sweat and motivate you for more  BUT, I really think this is a great DVD for the 30 days only (unless you have not worked out in a while).  I have used this video to get back into a workout routine when I have been out of the routine for a while.  It puts me back into the playing field and prepares me for tougher workouts (like JM's own Burn Fat Boost Metabolism, or Bob Harpers Inside Out Method videos).    If you are standing on the fense of buying this DVD, all I can say is: go for it!! It is great, it will make you feel like you cant even walk for the next several days when you first start it, and it gives you all the motivation to continue with your fitness goals.  There was no better feeling for me than to do this 20 min workout as soon as I woke up and be energized for the rest of the day.    I have, and will continue to, suggest this DVD to anyone I know who is interested in getting in shape.
0316069353|1.0|I completely agree with Mr. Phillips that there is a lack of marketing common sense and some abuse in the pricing of ebooks over the prices listed for printed and hard cover , and paper cover books.  If this continues thus then, I, who have bought quite a few Kibdle books, shall look for other purchase options.    I do hope that you give due attention to this and other similar complaints.    H. Dothée
B0041KKYDI|5.0|This movie is my third favourite movie of all time. I absolutely adore it. I have such admiration for Aron Ralston and his story. This movie is so accurate to his book it's almost scary how close it is.
630514415X|4.0|Just included the movie disc itself without any additional features. It unfortunately is not compatible with my computer but works fine on the DVD.
B004UNB1R4|5.0|This album, this collection of songs, showcases the power of Robbie's songwriting skills. It is great to hear an artist communicate through songs something other than puppy love or how much money they make. The collaboration with Clapton is cool but what really makes the album great for me is all of the different sonic textures Robertson weaves in and out of each composition. His lyrics are also great - the right balance of storytelling and ambiguity - balanced by his loud whispery voice.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I can't wait until the next installment. Glad they're releasing it in phases so I don't get overwhelmed with levels - gives me time to get 3 stars on every level. Best game ever.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Inside Job is a must see for every American, especially those of us that have suffered at the hands of our government leaders, the Federal Reserve Chairmen, the Investment Rating Firms, the Insurance Firms and most of all the fat-cat Investment Bank CEOs and leaders.  Besides outlining precisely what caused the crash of the economy in 2008, the film also depicts the individuals who we elected and those who were appointed by our elected politicians as the greedy people they are.  Besides making you shake your head in disgust at the total disregard for the working-class American, the film will make you angry at our justice system for not bringing these white collar criminals to court, finding them guilty of stealing from America and sentencing them to return the hundreds of millions of dollars they walked away with as well as stripping them from their homes, cars, 401K plans, food on the table, clothes on their back, etc... forcing them to suffer the same way most of America is still suffering.    Something can be said for the Americans who allowed a bank to approve a mortgage for an amount they knew they could not afford.  Shame on these folks who trusted the \\"system\\" to evaluate their net worth and earning potential and still allowed them to mortgage more house than they could afford.  After watching this film, I guarantee you, most Americans will not allow it to happen to them a second time.
031261246X|3.0|The technical details are very solid, as should be expected from Mark's status in the tech industry. It's actually not such a bad story, but the tired chiches really bring it down. Does anyone actually still use \\"l33t speak\\" anymore, or is it just in this book that everyone chats & emails like a drunk, 2-fingered mentalist? Everybody from the script kiddies to professionals decided they need to type as incoherently as possible. That was almost enough to get me to stop reading.    If you are planning to read this on an Android device beware- some of the formatted chat & emails didn't show at all on the Android Amazon app.  However it displays just fine on the Windows Phone app.
630471193X|5.0|I had seen this movie several times, and I really did enjoy John Trovolta showing a soft side of himself that I had not seen before. I made several attempts to discuss the movie with my brother and he had not ever seen the movie even though it has been around for some time. I wanted him to see it, so I went to Amozon on the internet and had it sent to him. I have done this with books and also cd's. It is a good way to share different medias with each other. He has also had items sent to me from Amazon. Good way to share.
B000G6R7B8|2.0|I received mine early in February. It would stop two or three times a day despite 'exercising' it. Sent it back to the service center and although it will still go to sleep during normal wearing, it will stay awake if I 'exercise' it by doing forceful arm movements until it is fully wound (I can hear the winding mechanism at work).    I've had Seiko self winding watches since the early '60s when I was a soldier in the Far East. This behavior is not typical of the breed. I'm quite disappointed in the purchase.     Added later on. If I wear the watch on my dominant wrist, then it stays wound. That is not as it should be as I'm a reasonably active person.
B004L79VUI|5.0|I love this new music from Robbie Robertson. He can deliver up tempo songs and slower pretty songs too. I like the variety of songs on this album. My favorite track is \\"Axman\\".  This song is a groovy tune about the people who make their living making music. The guitar playing rocks on this cut. \\"Straight Down The Line\\" is a song that puts me in a good mood.  I like the spirit of this song very much. \\"He Don't Live No More\\" is an upbeat tune.  Ian Thomas provides a fantastic beat on this disc. \\"When The Night Was Young\\" is a smooth sounding song. I like the hopeful sentiment of this song.  Robbie duets with Eric Clapton on the track \\"Fear Of Falling\\".  Their voices sound so good together on this song.  Any song featuring Clapton has great guitar playing. This song follows that trend.  I like the bluesy tone to this cut.  Robbie proves that he can make beautiful music without lyrics.  The instrumental \\"Madame X\\" is very lovely and moving.  The other instrumental on this song is \\"Tango For Django\\".  This song is very sensual.  I like this song a lot.  \\"How To Become Clairvoyant\\" is a song with a funky beat. I want to become clairvoyant so this song is very interesting to me.  The best love song on this album is \\"Won't Be Back\\".  I like the tenderness of Robbie's vocals here.  This song is pretty.  \\"The Right Mistake\\" is an enjoyable four minute song. The song title contains two words that are not usually associated together. I like the cleverness of the lyrics of this song.  This is enjoyable new music from Robbie Robertson.
0316056863|5.0|it doesn't get any funnier than this. i also noted (what i believe are) some chelsea handler references in the book which where fun to spot. she mentions that to write a best selling book one of its topics has to be about \\"one night stands\\". Tina is hilarious in every way and deserves your money. it'll get the biggest smile on your face. p.s. dont read it in the subway. i realized a little to late that i looked like a crazy person laughing so hard.
B00466HN68|4.0|Helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a commuter train in the body of another man just moments before the train is destroyed by a bomb.  He learns that he is part of a mission to find the bomber, and that's all I feel comfortable saying.  Director Duncan Jones and writer Ben Ripley allow us to share Colter's confusion, and the main pleasure of this intelligently scripted film is watching him discover not only the identity of the bomber but the true nature of his assignment.    Most science fiction films are really action movies or horror films, so it's nice to see one that relies on clever writing rather than special effects.  Jones infuses his thriller with a believable and touching love story through the introduction of Christina (Michelle Monaghan), a doomed fellow commuter.  I missed Jones's first film, \\"Moon,\\" but now I want to see it.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|I HAVE LOVED AL JARREAU FOR YEARS AND GEORGE BENSON IS WONDERFUL!!! TOGETHER THEY ARE MAGIC!!
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I love angry birds but have way too many issues installing their apps on my EVO. For the original and season I have to take out the sim card everytime to update them. It took me 45 minutes to research how to delete a corrupt file on my Apple and install the application. You'd think they'd actually try installing these apps on phones and perfect the installation before releasing the games.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|I still can't decide what I thought of this novel. On the surface I would say that I didn't like the characters. It was very hard to be sympathetic to any side in this story. I finished this book about 2 months ago and I still think about it, which in my mind is what a good book does for you. The characters are so well written, even though they're not very attractive.
B000003N89|5.0|She has got to be the best woman playing music out there right now in the world. I got to see her in person and she was GREAT
B000IAZ5HK|5.0|Very well proportioned and well designed oil and vinegar pourer. The shape of the vessel feels great in the hand and looks great on the table. Lightweight yet sturdy, oil does not drip, catchment if any should, and the gasket provides a secure seal. Highly recommend, the best oil dispenser I have ever owned.
1439102724|5.0|If there were more than 5 stars, this author would get them all.  This book, true to form, is an awesome read, impossible to put down, and totally engrossing, as are all of her other books.  Each book seems to get better and better.  This is the author that you anticipate.  You wait and look and wait and look for when her next book is coming out.  I only wish she could write more books faster, but as I always do, I'll wait with bated breath for the next new one.  She is an AWESOME author, and this book was excellent.
B000VZIOCK|5.0|This is simply one of the best records released since the turn of the millennium. Its a concept album I suppose, but it totally works: a drive in a car from LA to Joshua tree while flipping radio stations. Every song is great, Homme sounds fantastic, guests include the mighty Dave Grohl, and the fake radio station excerpts pull the whole damn thing together.<br /><br />Easily one of my favorite records ever.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I'm not one much for a &quot;chick flick&quot;, but I'm hooked. I almost wore it out the first weekend I owned it. I don't grow tired with it &amp; am in awe of all the acting.<br /><br />My daughter said, &quot;That's the sexiest movie I have ever seen with virtually NO sex in it!&quot; She is absolutely right.
B004RUF9DC|3.0|I have just started to watch my copy of the Greatest Story ever told and after watching the Ten Commandments and King of Kings I am a little disappointed..........it isn't the worst transfer I have seen on blu ray, Django holds that dubious honour and is now an over priced coaster.    ten Commandments and King of Kings show how older films can look on HD, The transfer hasn't put me off watching this lovely film, but please be aware the upgrade from DVD isn't that great, please please do not let once upon a time in the west or Ben Hur when they come out be a disappointment.    I have given this release 3 stars for the movie and not the quality of the Blu Ray, I am still glad I have this movie but after watching King of Kings.......it feels like a wasted opportunity.    As we will probably never get these biblical releases over here in the UK I am still happy with my purchase.
0811875539|5.0|Not much you can say here.  Andrew Zuckerman's work is always stunning... I only hope that one day he releases a book showing the behind the scenes of these amazing shots!
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Had free version for a while.  Was happy to see version 2. Gives championship option,  1 or 2 players, change board and still the basics.  Great game play on both my Galaxy Tab and Vibrant.  No problem so far.  File is HUGE so peeps with wimpy phone storage don't download. HIGH END DEVICES ONLY.
6305212112|5.0|All I can say is Awesome! I love this movie so much. I could watch it 100 times and never get tired of it. great story, great cast.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|I got this for my girlfriend as a spur of the moment gift because a) it is her favorite movie and b) I couldn't beat Amazon's gold box deal of the day price that easily beats any other site/store I have seen this at.<br />The blu-ray is clean, played it on my 42 LCD 1080p and everything was stunning. the box has some extra's (not to mention the DVD) including the favorite things musical box and various postcards from Salzburg (acutally usable if you want to). I would recommend this product to any boyfriend looking to please his significant other.
0312370849|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, but elements of good fiction were missing: character development, engaging prose, immersion, believability, and some unpredictability.  I was surprised at the mediocre writing since so many reviews use the words \\"beautiful.\\"  When giving a review, I have to stay true to what qualifies as a beautifully told, intriguing story.  It's a  difficult to give a negative review when the subject matter really is important/horrifying/historical and should be remembered.  I felt de Rosnay's pain and passion regarding this gruesome event in history (Vel' d'Hiv'), and she certainly proved that she did a lot of research.  But the problem is that it felt like a work of research that she tried to wrap a story around; it felt like she was trying to evoke an emotional response without having done the job of creating characters that drew us in to their humanity.  As many other reviewers have pointed out, the story of Julia was not all that compelling, and took away from Sarah's tragedy.  One of the mantras that I remember from writing class is \\"Show--don't tell.\\"  De Rosnay  repeatedly told how people were feeling, but she didn't show, if that makes sense.  I came away with the feeling that since Julia SAID her life was changed from discovering this atrocity in history, that I was supposed to understand that.  I didn't \\"buy\\" that her life could or was changed by this discovery.  Why had no other horrible acts of the Holocaust changed her before this? If you want to learn about Vel' d'Hiv', I'd suggest doing your own research.  It may sound disrespectful to say that this book was boring--how could such a horrific story be boring?  Read the 2 stars reviews and you will find that all the criticisms are consistent with one another.
0525422943|5.0|If you've read If I Stay, which I highly recommend if you haven't, you know it leaves you hanging (and possibly looking like a hot mess with all the crying you'll do if you are anything like me) ...so I was extremely nervous as to how Gayle was going to pick up the story in Where She Went. From the moment I read the first few pages, I knew she was a freaking genius as we get to see the aftermath of If I Stay from the perspective of Adam! Right away I was even more excited to see how things played out for Mia and Adam after such a horrific time in their lives.<br /><br />I honestly loved this much anticipated book to pieces and felt as though it really lived up to If I Stay and how it resonated with me. If I'm honest, I actually enjoyed it more AND felt such a stronger connection to the characters and their experiences in the grieving process. I was nervous as to how I was going to handle delving into the theme of grief and that whole process, as I have a whole lot of unfinished grieving to do myself, and I thought it was done remarkably well without depressing the reader. I could feel the intensity and the rawness of the emotions and the lingering questions that were left unanswered for Adam as well as for Mia. I could feel for her and understood why she did some of the things she did despite the fact that seemed cruel.<br /><br />Poor Adam...you really felt for him. While he seemed like a Grade A d-bag now that he was a rockstar, you could tell that he was the same sensitive and wonderful Adam that we loved in If I Stay and just had to work through some of his angst and baggage. He really was grieving a loss too. Losing someone in the way he \\"lost\\" Mia is still a loss. I thought that the way Forman incorporated snippets of lyrics from Adam's music was such a powerful way to show just how much the event had affected him. They seemed so real and not at all contrived. Mia was clearly the muse. I believed in those lyrics.<br /><br />I thought the way she revealed WHY Mia made the decision she did was done so well and at a perfectly natural pace as it gracefully coasted between the present and past memories.  I could feel that anticipation building up and I could feel the questions just nagging at Adam because they were also nagging at me. I loved their reunion and the way that Mia took him on the \\"tour\\". I was just DYING to find out if they'd end up together or not...or if their lives were so drastically different and too much time had passed for it to work out. The culmination of all those bottled up feelings and unanswered questions took its toll on me and rendered me a blubbering mess. Oh, the bridge scene!<br /><br />My one teeny tiny gripe: I found it strange that Mia, Adam and Kim were all extremely successful at such a young age. Maybe I'm just sour grapes :P<br /><br />My Final Thought:  Where She Went was just as heart-wrenching and emotional as If I Stay but I found that it went even deeper and really captured different aspects of the grieving process so genuinely. Forman's writing proves to be just as powerful and she really did an excellent job capturing Adam's perspective and still providing us with sufficient insight into Mia. I was thoroughly unable to put this one down, as I was with If I Stay, and I was quite pleased with the direction that Forman took with their story. If you haven't read If I Stay, please do....between it and Where She Went you'll be wholly invested in their story and it will make you appreciate those special people in your life. Pick this up in April when it comes out!<br /><br />Review on my &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">blog!&lt;/a>did was done so well and at a perfectly natural pace as it gracefully coasted between the present and past memories.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|It's neck & neck with Clue as my favorite strategy board game.  Catan is a lot of fun, and even my first-grader caught on quickly and enjoys it.  The box says 60-minutes average playing time.  We usually take 2 hours.  To play in an hour, we adjusted the # of points to win to 7 (instead of 10 per the instructions).  All of my extended family loves this game!
0823015033|5.0|This is a great book for anyone interested in polymer clay sculpting! This book has great tips for sculpting in polymer clay, ranging from sculpting hands, feet, torsos, and faces. This book even shows techniques for creating life-like hair from twine! It shows how to fabricate textured clay in the form of clothing like suede, denim, and lace and shows how to build and incorporate wire and aluminum foil armatures for your figures/figurines.<br /> The book came in a plastic wrap and although I ordered it new, the cover corners were a little bent but I think this was due to the packaging. Pages were crisp and shiny and the author did a great job of describing their techniques in detail with the inclusion of step-by-step references photos.<br />Overall I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in polymer clay techniques. I am a total greenhorn to this art but with this book I feel I could be a master artisan in no time!
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are excellent in this film as they play Valerie Plame and her husband Joe Wilson. The subject that almost breaks up their marriage is whether Valerie sent Joe to Niger to prove the Bush Adminstration a fraud on the war with Iraq. She didn't. Wilson found no evidence that that country (which the Bush Administration cannot even pronounce correctly) had shipped uranium to Sadam Hussein with which to make nuclear weapons.  They could not even get it out of the ground! and would not recognise it if they saw it. The turning point in the film is when a delivery boy flips a daily newspaper on their drive, which \\"outs\\" Valerie as the CIA agent who sent Joe to Niger (no luxury there) and allowed the Bush administration to start a war which continues to this day. He wrote an essay the title  of which was \\"What I Did Not Find in Niger.\\" Thereafter their marriage almost breaks up over the Administration's claim that she did send him, which a majority of the country believes. We follow Valerie's heartbreak after she is fired for the supposed leak from a job she loved. The family, with two small twins, starts to crumble. Eventually they find the Libby-Armitage connection to the leak to Bob Novak, a Republican journalist (though I don't recall hearing his name mentioned in the film, probably because he's dead now anyway). If anyone doubts that the Bush Administration was the worst in history, he or she need only see this movie. The one reviewer who gave it a one-star rating is undoubtedly a Republican. Bush, Cheney, and Rice all make cameo appearances as they speak the words that got us into the Iraq mess in which innocent civilians and soldiers lost their lives. Valerie and Joe moved to Santa Fe where I met both. I tried to convince Joe to run for governor, but he declined citing too much public service already. I don't blame him if Bush-Cheney are the epitome of public service. A fine film about political corruption.  John K. Crane. Santa Fe
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the best movies ever made. Every time I see it, it astounds me to think that people can be so evil to each other, yet fills me with so much hope that they can also do so many great things. This film inspires me to learn more about what happened during the holocaust, what led an entire nation to be so cruel. How is this sort of thing possible? If you have not seen this movie, then you are crazy. Its long, and some parts are hard to watch, but I think it should be required to see.
B004L79VUI|5.0|An amazing album from the rock legend.  Its been 10 years since the last one, and he certainly used the time to put the work in on this one.  A very personal and open album, with so many great songs.  I especially love \\"This is Where I Get Off\\" and \\"When the Night Was Young.\\"
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This was one of the first films that made me fully appreciate what cinema can do for a culture. I remember seeing this and being amazed at what the director was conveying just through the arrangement of images, the use of sound, the use of editing. I never knew that movies could be used in such a way. Not to mention that the story is very compelling, albeit very dark. For a movie where not much happiness comes out at the end, I felt surprisingly refreshed after viewing it. No single thing has done more to deter me from ever doing hard drugs than this film. I feel they should show this movie in high school health classes. Extremely powerful and a must see.
B004KA9MQO|4.0|I really like Jennifer Hudson so with her 1st album I was expecting a classic but it was good but not GREAT!! this 2nd album is an excellent follow up she has some bangas like ,\\"I Remember Me\\" a rhythmic radio hit.could be her #1.love IT!!.\\"Where You At\\" a classic R&B jam written by the 1 and only R.Kelly..\\"Why Is It So Hard\\"...mmm good like a apple pie on a Sunday afternoon..I LoVe this song!!! reminds me so much of Gladys Knight and that's a GREAT thing..wooo..\\"I Got This\\" she shows her swag on this feel good jam..great album track! \\" Angel\\" is angelic feels so soulful ..really would do good as a summer single..it gives me that vibe..\\"Still Here\\" is such a great ballad..reminds me of something Whitney would have ripped anew 1 lol..\\"Feeling Good\\" left me speechless.. without a question an amazing uplifting encouraging track that is really EPIC feeling.Closes the album with a BANG.Good work Jennifer STELLAR.B+
B004NSULHM|3.0|Not up to par with Kid A(or Amnesiac for that matter). The king of limbs is a really good album..... It is VERY reminiscent of Thom Yorke's solo album with a touch of Amnesiac. All n' All i can only see this album growing on me in the future, ALTHOUGH i have to get the desire to listen to it a few more times before it can. That being said this album and The Eraser both suffer from one thing that can either delay or completely prevent that, and that is they both lack in immediate replay value (with not one track that really stands out from the get go)....BUT they both overall sound good and king of limbs might get the second chance i never personally(regretably)gave the eraser. All n' All The king of limbs is the best radiohead album in about a decade which totally trumps the crappy in rainbows(just my opinion) and the predictable Hail to the Theif. 3 stars (and hopefully rising)    Excuse My Poor Grammer  Robert Keith
B004LP10PO|4.0|Everything came together just right for Norman Jewison on this trendy caper:  McQueen (against type) and Dunaway (sharp as a knife), Alan R. Trustman's glib script, Pablo Ferro's split-screen effects, Haskell Wexler's cinematography and Michel Legrand's ultra-hip music.  It is what it is, a product of it's time and a slick exercise in style; but it works as pure, detached entertainment.  The sloppy remake with Pierce Brosnan (too typecast) and Renee Russo (looking more like a drag queen than Dunaway could ever do in sixties haute couture) intriguingly tries to ground the conflicting emotions of the characters in reality, but the attempts at grown-up behavior and a stupid happy ending just defeats the concept.  The blu-ray version is filmlike and true to the original presentation, the original mono sound is presented in 2-track DTS-HD and requires some cinema EQ.  This high-definition version of the original THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR had a limited release as an exclusive, but hopefully will be made more widely available in time.
0316069353|2.0|I don't know who controls the prices for the books and the kindle prices, Im sure it is the authors, but when Amazon was selling us on the kindles, it was because most of the books were 9.99 or less! Now, we are paying MORE than the hardcover. This is getting outragous! I don't know about anyone else but I am still making trips to the library every week to keep up with reading habit because it is to exspensive, lol..Thanks amazon for selling us a machine and then raising the prices so it doesnt make a difference anyway. We'll just keep buying the books and give them away because they are cheaper.But after all that is said, I do love reading Micheal Connelly's books, and am sorry to say will not pay the 14.99 that amazon wants for the kindle price, but will wait untill it is free from the library or buy it used! Sorry, im only going to read it once Micheal. Drop the price. Don't be so greedy.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Hello amazon.com readers. This video game just arrived in the mail the other day, and it seems great, but can anybody tell me how to skip the opening cutscene? It's been going for like an hour now, it's insane.
0061122416|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. When i got the book in Spanish and started reading a few pages I just couldn't stop reading.  I could understand why this book has negative comments since it's not the same when you read a book translated in another language other than its original native language. If you see the reviews for this book in the Spanish or Portuguese version most people give it 5 stars.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|I had high expectations when I borrowed this movie from the library to watch with my 14-year-old daughter. She had read these books several years ago so she didn't remember all the details, but that's probably a good thing judging by the other reviews here from fans of the books. As someone who had not read the books I saw it from a different perspective than my daughter. The storyline didn't make any sense. It jumps from one thing to another with no connections. Percy's instant acceptance of his previously unknown heritage is totally unbelieveable. The characters always seem to locate the one thing they need, know the exact place to go & the right thing to do when they get there. If you have read the books, your mind will probably fill in these gaping holes in the story, but for me it was just frustrating to watch.
B000001ESP|5.0|In a music genre where most of the music is sex, drugs & r'n'r I believe that Rush stands out by being different. Rush have very intelligent lyrics, signature time changes, complex epic songs and musical integrity. The band prides themselves on being very good musicians and are each masters of their instruments. The Canadian progressive-rock trio  have no shortage of great music and albums, however, to some listeners Moving Pictures is probably the best Rush album because while it still has that epic and progressive typical Rush feel to it, it's not one big piece that you have to listen to entirely at once like 2112 or Hemispheres. Moving Pictures continues the more radio-friendly formula of 1980's Permanent Waves and as far as I'm concerned do it very well, while maintaining the Rush sound and great music.  I suppose the best way to define the album is by saying that it's the most accessible Rush album, after all, not everyone like 20+ minutes songs or grandiose epic songs (I do), for this release the band when for a less epic and more direct-to-the-point approach. MP remains Rush's most successful album to date (4X Platinum) if that says anything, but every fans have their own opinion of which is the band's best album.<br /><br />Let's go through some of the songs. \\"Tom Sawyer\\" is obviously the big it on Moving Pictures, it's a classic rock track and one of the songs the band is best known for. I've heard it thousands of times but it's a great song and a true classic, what can I say? \\"Limelight\\" is my personal favorite song of the album AND my favorite Rush song. It describes the experiences of fame. \\"YYZ\\" is an excellent instrumental song which shows just how good each band members are at their respective instruments. It's a fantastic piece of music and remains one of the band's best musical pieces even if instrumental. Moving Pictures has what many Rush fans consider to be the last true \\"epic\\" song the band did, \\"The Camera Eye\\". Well Rush IS nothing short of epic but what I mean by epic are the real long Rush songs, the epic pieces. \\"Vital Signs\\" is a true highlight of MP, the song is fairly long at over minutes, Geddy displays a lot of emotion in his voice on this one. I feel it's one of the band's best songs.<br /><br />After Moving Pictures, Rush went into a more commercial or radio-appealing sound (although I wouldn't consider the band to be commercial) with more keyboard-oriented songs and sounded more like contemporary 1980's music.  Moving Pictures is one of Rush's best albums and an excellent place to get into the band but don't miss out on the band's other classic works like \\"2112\\" and \\"Hemispheres\\"! 5 stars for this one.hat I mean by epic are the real long Rush songs, the epic pieces. \\"Vital Signs\\" is a true highlight of MP, the song is fairly long at over minutes, Geddy displays a lot of emotion in his voice on this one.

B000002OOY|5.0|John Williams has got to be the most talented music composer of all time.  This CD is awesome.  I play it all the time in my car for easy listening pleasure.  There's no noise on this CD, it's all beautiful easy to listen to music.
B004OA2G0E|4.0|I can't believe all the negative reviews of Radiohead's wonderful new album.  What do you people want from Radiohead?  They may never scale the creative heights of KID A again, but that's ok, they are still (and always have been) making challenging, intriguing music and have charted their own unique path through the trendy dull landscape of modern music, and have nearly always been ahead of the curve.  Music effects everyone differently, and it comes down to a simple fact: does it move you?  Does it create a world you can live in for 40 minutes?  Does it illicit an emotion?  I would have to say (for me) The King Of Limbs succeeds on all levels.  By now, we have to expect each new Radiohead record to be a new experience.  I like the fact that KOL is a bit more laid back and subdued than the brilliant In Rainbows.  To me, it seems like the right record for them to make at this point, and I'm sure they are quite happy with it.  As always, there are layers of head-swirling sounds coming at you as in the stunning opener \\"Bloom\\".  It's almost too much to take in at first, but this album really reveals itself over repeated listenings. As many reviewers have mentioned, Radiohead has given us one of their most beautiful tracks ever with Codex.  The simplicity of the piano and Thom Yorke's vocal carry this classic to greatness.  The other star of this album and often overlooked is the incredible Phil Selway.  His inventive  acoustic drumming really drives these electronic pulsing tracks.  The beats are so quirky and surrounded by so much electronica, you forget a human is really in the driver's seat.    I have been listening to this album for a few weeks now, and can't find anything I don't like about it.  I just recently got the vinyl a few days ago.  It's not as \\"dead quiet\\" as I'd like, with an odd pop here and there, but it is a nice 180 gram record with a great vinyl richness, and the price was nice at under $15.  I'd buy a heck of a lot more vinyl if more of it were priced reasonably like King Of Limbs.
0792165020|4.0|A movie about the life styles of wealthy self-absorbed privileged entitled people and a wanna be. By far the best thing about this movie was seeing Matt Damon stretched to whole new level as the infatuated menanical Ripley.  Phillip Seymore Hoffman is so sleazy that just watching him makes you want to take a shower. This movie is seemingly intentionally void of any redeeming characters or plot line, making me wonder what was the point, beyond the obvious message that people can be real bastards when allowed to be. The only point of light in this movie was Peter and his attempt to reach out to Ripley. But that was secondary, rushed, at the end, and didn't turn out as one may have hope. The DVD image of Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow is misleading and the DVD could use a redesign to better reflect the movie (which is film noir not a romance).
B000UX6THK|1.0|This has quickly become one of my all time favorite shows. Amazing setting, characters, music, and a great variety of tones.    My complaint is with the seller. I ordered a New copy of the series from Amazon, but I received a used copy. It did not affect my love for the series, but it was taped together and it was missing many of the inserts that were supposed to come with the set.    I would expect this, if I took a chance on a used copy, but Amazon should not be playing little games like that.
B004289ZW0|4.0|Aviators looking to use their iPads for navigating need to give this item a serious look. The GNS 5870 locks onto satellites quickly and hangs on to these locks tenaciously. I typically place mine on the glare shield just in front of a C172's  whiskey compass. Coupled to either WingX or Foredlight the GNS 5870's position information takes full advantage of both apps' mapping capabilities.
B0018CWEYY|1.0|I never received the product and after three attempts to contact the seller for a refund, I had to contact Amazon directly for help in getting my refund.  Very shady, beware of this seller!  Go with another seller, such a hassle, I am very careful not to purchase anything from Classic Cottage now.
B004MOMT2M|5.0|Finally I can say that I am proud to own this edition of this classic masterpiece by the best band Canada ever had. Never before until now have I heard Moving Pictures sound so crisp ,clear and \\"in your face\\", until this great deluxe anniversary edition,and also the dvd containing the three original promo videos including Vital Signs never before released on dvd and first time released since the long out of print \\"through the camera eye\\" release on vhs. For us die hard Long time Rush fans this is a great addition to your collection, and to the young generation yet to discover Rush, this is the album ,and the version to start with . It definitly is like hearing it for the first time all over again. and it feels like you are discoveing the band again , like I did when this album was out back in 1981.

B00474IVGA|5.0|Love this album! And wow, Garrett Hedlund's voice is absolutely dreamy! My complaint is that they did not release the duet, Give In To Me, with Garrett and Leighton singing it, it's soooo much more moving than Faith Hill's version. Also love the song, A Little Bit Stronger by Sara Evans as well as Me and Tennessee. This entire album is worth adding to your Country music collection! One huge request.....Garrett Hedlund, cut an album of your own :)
0316069353|1.0|I think Mr Connelly needs to have a discussion with his publisher.  Perhaps ripping off the e-reading public is not the best move for an author, even a very talented author.  I can wait for the paper-back rather than reward Little Brown for bad behavior.
B004U8VWIM|3.0|Really liked this movie minus a couple of scenes, and the streaming was never choppy (though it shouldn't be). This is the 4th movie I've rented from Amazon VOD and the other ones were definitely HD quality, this did not seem to be HD (wouldn't care if they didn't charge a dollar more, not to mention the fact that I am paying so much for a movie that I only have access to for 48 hours) Lastly, the pausing and other buttons which have worked in the past didn't work so when I had to leave for a minute I missed part of the movie. Oh well, I guess this is what passes for entertainment now. Would have given this a 1 if I wasn't moved by the movie so much
0316069353|1.0|Well this is ridiculous.  The Kindle edition, which has no printing costs, is higher than the hardback price.  I'll wait and read it from the library.. the publisher then gets ZERO dollars!
B004LP601S|5.0|This album only has ten tracks, most of which stay in a three and a half time range with a few exceptions. The sound quality is great and the various tracks flow great together. Don't mistake that for there being a lack of variety though, the album is simply uniformed and consistent with the great vocals, lyrics and sound. My personal favorites are (#2) Let's Kill Tonight and (#4) Memories.
1401310400|3.0|After watching Castle for three seasons I'll be honest: I expected Richard Castle to be a better writer.    The character of Castle talks a lot about what good writing is so it was very surprising to read such a poorly written book. I was expecting Castle's style to be similar to Dennis Lehane, Harlan Coban or James Patterson. Instead, ABC studios published what read more like hastily written fan fiction.    But, let's set aside the style of writing because I understand for everyone that disliked the writing there were people that loved it. It's very subjective. Let's instead assume Richard Castle is a real person, a real author that's been riding along with detectives to research a book. Would he really make the characters in his book so obviously based on the real life counterparts? No. Heat Wave is semi-biographical with many of the situations taken straight out of Castle's \\"real life\\" experiences riding along with Beckett. If I were Beckett, I would expect a cut of the royalties.    Heat Wave is, basically, a \\"Castle\\" novel. The characters are \\"fictionalized\\" just enough so that the reader can have the pleasure of watching their beloved characters, Beckett and Castle, hook up without the series going there. It is a long form episode script, with just enough purple prose filling out the pages to qualify it as a book.     I agree with the reviewer that said ABC studios missed an opportunity to start a legitimate mystery series with complex characters and a vivid world. Instead, they created a book that was obviously written by a television writer based in Los Angeles with the Hollywood backlot idea of New York City.     Why did I give this book three stars? I give five stars for ABC Studios and Andrew Marlowe for the cross platform promotion. Having books published written by \\"Castle\\" is brilliant. But, the novel itself gets one star for the poor writing quality and for so obviously being the show characters with different names. Castle is one of my top three shows and I'll be with it until the bitter end. But, I my opinion of Richard Castle has been slightly altered, and not for the better.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|As a child I read all the Walter Farley novels about boys and their wild horses.  So it is no wonder that I own the 1979 Francis Ford Coppola movie adaptation of Farley's, THE BLACK STALLION, starring Kelly Reno, Teri Garr, Hoyt Axton, and Mickey Rooney.  As my parents became too old to enjoy movie-theatre visits, I bought them a VCR, and later a DVD-player, and would have regular \\"movie-nights\\" for them with the stories I knew they would like.  My folks sat through the entire 2-hours of Farley's story of the magnificent wild Arabian, \\"The Black,\\" - and continued watching through all of the final credits, which were played over the outtakes of the stallion rolling in the beach-sand with Kelly Reno.  When it finally faded to black, my mother said, \\"That's the best movie I've ever watched.\\"    My parents are gone.  There are now two other \\"great-stories-well-told\\" about horses and the people who loved them; the 2003 adaptation of the Laura Hillenbrand book SEABISCUIT, starring Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges, and Chris Cooper; and the latest, SECRETARIAT, starring Diane Lane and John Malkovich.    I give 5+ stars to all of them.  The Farley story is of course fiction - but very-well told.  The Hillebrand epoch tells the true story of how the lives of three broken people during the Great Depression were transformed by a nearly-broken horse.  SECRETARIAT tells the improbably but true story of a housewife who came into her own during the Vietnam era, with a horse she acquired with the toss of a coin, and risked everything to make him a winner.  I have a new respect for Diane Lane.  She did a magnificent job.  Malkovich, as the trainer, was his annoying best.  As for the horse, Secretariat - well - he was an Olivier, a Streisand, a Muhammad Ali - in his field he was \\"without peer\\" - the best!    I'll be keeping all of these fine productions, and re-watching them over the years.  I am very sorry I couldn't share these fine movie-productions with my folks.
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|This album to me is as memorable as the one before it. Starts off very strong. they also use a tad bit of effects but nothing too fancy, and they used them wisely. great choices. everyone has truely out preformed their previous efforts. this topped so many things. track 3 is the best in my opinion. you should buy this if you liked the previous two albums. this is an amazing follow up and is easily one of my top 5 metal albums. very catchy and plenty of solos compared to before. pick it up today! it'll be worth it.
1582701709|5.0|Unlike any other book I have purchased in the past.  Absolutely wonderful!  A great guide to inner peace and contentment.  I have given friends and family this book as a gift to them \\"paying it forward.\\"  It has truly changed their lives as well as mine!
0525422943|2.0|If I Stay is one of my favorite books, and sadly, like most sequels, this is nowhere near as triumphant as the first. Everything seemed a little to easy at the end of it all. I prefer having the open end of the first book, allowing the reader to continue the story and the lives of these characters as they see fit. Ultimately, an unnecessary and unmoving sequel.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|One of the best apps on my phone, hands down.  Great for troubleshooting at home or work - or just a quick view of what networks are available when you aren't home.  It's also plain fun walking around the house, with the strength meter beeping, and finding out the effect different distances, walls, floors, and even people between you and the AP have on the connection.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|This watch is always compared to the Daytona, which is not a fair comparison.  Invica's goal with this piece was to style the watch similar to the Daytona, but never to offer the same functionality.  Let's get the bad out of the way first and the worst part about purchasing this watch is realizing when it arrives that it is NOT an instrument for measuring speed with the chronograph.  In fact, the subdials are more or less there just for asthetic appeal and to offer the same styling as the Daytona.  The standard large sweeping second hand is constantly in motion and does not accurately match it's marking with the tachymeter bezel. (bad craftmanship).  As with all fine watches that have a chronograph feature, the second hand is normally one of the subdials and the large sweeping second hand is for timing purposes only, but NOT with this watch!  The Speedway's subdial at the 6 mark is for \\"measuring\\" the speed or time of something in seconds and the subdial at the 9 mark keeps track of that same \\"measurement\\" in minutes.  This is started and stopped by using the screw down push buttons.  The other subdial at the 3 mark is only merely used to display the current time as a GMT/24 hour clock and serves absolutely no purpose for the chronograph timing.  So basically, the chronograph/tachymeter on this watch is completely useless (except for a basic stop-watch function in seconds and minutes only).  Second bad thing is Amazon's picture is that of the older version of this watch which still shows indication marks at the 3, 6, and 9 positions.  The newer version of this watch does not have these and the subdials are slightly farther apart.  Not good for Amazon.  Not a big deal for me either way, but it would have been nice to have the correct picture/description of the product.  Now the Good!!!  Everything else!!  The white dial has a beautiful pattern on it that adds character.  The watch itself is very solid and comfortable and shines brightly the same way a very expensiveswiss timepiece would.  It feels solid and sturdy.  It definately pulls off the \\"Daytona look\\" without having to shell out $12,000.  I say go for it if you don't mind the chronograph function problem.

B0000WPADK|1.0|The Revell Big Boy is really a disappointment. If you are a railway hobbyist, try to buy a Bachmann or the like instead with far superior detailing and accuracy. The Revell is just a cheap representation suitable for kids. Its railing is moded with the boiler but with the space between the railing and the boiler blocked. The end result is like a pair of narrow wings on the boiler. Also, the brakes are missing. It makes the model very uncomfortable to look at. In fact the same problem with the Hudson, another one of the same series by Revell. After 20 years with the completed model, I still cant figure out how the make good the deficit. it seems one day I would have to throw it into the trashbin!!!

0525422943|5.0|What if you made a promise to the one you loved that if they stayed you would leave if they asked? And what if they took you up on that promise?<br /><br />How could you go on knowing they were out there somewhere living their life without you? A life that you thought you would always be a part of. Knowing their smile was no longer yours, that they were no longer yours.<br /><br />How would you continue if they took a piece of your soul with them? What could you do to fill the void created by their absence?<br /><br />Who would you blame for the promise you made?<br /><br />***<br /><br />Where She Went is the achingly beautiful and truly exceptional follow-up to If I Stay. Told from Adam Wilde's perspective readers are carried along through his emotional wasteland as he strives to cope with his new existence without Mia and struggles to understand what went wrong.<br /><br />Author Gayle Forman has once again delivered an exceptionally written story filled with the raw and staggering emotions that accompany loss. Adam's confusion, emptiness and helplessness just seep off the page and attach themselves to the reader, making his pain their own.<br /><br />The author once again shifts back and forth between past and present, as Adam recalls moments from his past and theirs, creating continuity between his story and Mia's. A story which is intertwined with hers, but whereas her suffering was filled with hopelessness, his is filled with a pain that is sharp, simmering just under the surface and ready to explode.<br /><br />Where She Went is just as beautiful and sorrowful as its predecessor, but there is also a tenderness, yearning and hopefulness to Adam's story that is breathtaking and unexpected.<br /><br />This book can be read without having read If I Stay as the author infuses just enough of Mia's story to make book readable on its own. However, readers will be missing out on something simply incredible if they do not read both books.

0316069353|1.0|I will not be buying either the Ebook or the Hardcover even though I like Connelly's work.  I do not like being taken advantage of.  It can't possibly cost more to publish an Ebook than to print a hardcover. I would love to see a pie chart of the costs including royalties of an ebook vs a hardcover book.  A writer told me that she was not getting any of the Ebook profits.  If not, then who is?  It reminds me of the film deals that did not include provisions for videocassettes.  The lawyers recified that problem for the actors.<br /><br />I would like to point out that my son who used to read a book every few months is now an avid ebook reader buying another book as soon as his current one is finished.  I would think that they would be making more money for the publisher not less.  Since hardback books and bookstores are becoming obsolete, maybe the solution is to ELIMINATE the publisher also and have author's like Michael Connelly go direct to Amazon to sell their books!

B004SQS9FA|1.0|The strengths of Radiohead have always been to use dense layers of sound and rhythm, building gradually to create drama in a four minute song; and to provide changes that maintain interest or provide a climax.  The weaknesses of Radiohead have always been Thom Yorke's voice and a general lack of virtuosity. This album emphasizes the voice, does not build drama, does not have many changes, and has no musicianship.  Indeed, it is not clear that anyone actually performs here for longer than 15 seconds at a time - just long enough to make a sample to loop through the rest of the piece.  It reminds me a little bit of Phillip Glass' music from the last century, except that Glass was doing new things.    I know that many people like Thom Yorke's voice.  Those people will like this work.  Many people like ambient music.  They will like this.  However, I have always liked Radiohead for the drama and power and variation that they could create with a large selection of instruments.  For me, this work doesn't get it done.    Edit:  I kept trying to listen to this, knowing that frequently Radiohead albums grow on me, to the point that e.g. Hail to the Thief is my favorite.  This one had the opposite effect.  The more one tries to look for sophistication, the more one is impressed by how insipid this work is.  It is not a Radiohead album, it is a Thom Yorke album.  'Nuff said.

Not only is the use of a second-person narrative throughout astonishingly well executed, but the character development is pristine as well, Bill's in particular. In the course of one week we see Bill evolve from strange, overbearing know-it-all coworker to mentor, friend, and even intrigued learner. But that's when things get interesting and take quite a turn in the story. I don't want to give anything major away but Bill sleeps with your wife at the end.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|How can anyone with \\"integrity of mind\\" not include anger reflected in the greed of the publisher when reading and reviewing the book?  It is all part and parcel of the same conundrum. Besides, where else are you going to raise your objections to the short-sightedness of publishers?  The publishers have sold their books of certain political persuasions to rich donors as  giveaways so they can say they are \\"runaway best sellers\\" while they really languish on counters in places like Costco, Wal-Mart and other big box stores. Despite reviews as political tripe, they are included in phony sales figures just the same.  The e-book market will threaten this ploy now and in the future.  Who wants a crappy political book on their reader? It can become the real pulse of the national interest.<br /><br />In the meantime, if the boycott of \\"plus $9.99 prices for e-books\\" and 26 checkouts of e-books limit at libraries, good authors such as Michael Connelly will have to suffer in sales and good reviews.
0525422943|5.0|Where She Went is set in New York City, three years after If I Stay ended and told in Adam's first person point of view. Adam is now a bona fide rock star but he's not happy and don't quite know what to do with himself--he is not getting along with his band members, he has the paparazzi and fans chasing him wherever he goes, he's tabloid fodder and these days music no longer gives him that joy and electricity in his blood like before. Mia and Adam are also no longer together, ever since Mia left for Julliard and never came back. But a chance meeting in New York City brings the two together again and they are given the opportunity to revisit their past as well as figure out if they have a future together.<br /><br />I was quite happy with the way If I Stay ended--it was a bittersweet yet it had a happy-ever-after feel because Mia decided to stay with Adam--so I was quite surprised when I found out about Where She Went. I thought Ms. Forman couldn't possibly top the awesomeness that is If I Stay but it didn't stop me from wanting to get my hands on WSW and read what happened to Mia and Adam three years later. I had very high expectations and this book did not disappoint. I wouldn't say it was better than IIS but I loved it just as much, if not just a little bit more.<br /><br />I had my doubts in the beginning about it being in Adam's POV because I didn't quite know what to make of him in IIS. Usually, I fall in love a little bit with the love interest along with the heroine but I didn't feel that way with Adam--he was sweet and everything (and I'm probably the lone wolf in this) but his character just didn't click with me. But as I got to really know Adam, where he came from and got peer into his thoughts and emotions (as opposed to seeing him through Mia's eyes) first-hand in WSW, I was glad that the story was told in Adam's perspective. His character started out pathetic and sad and a spoiled rock star but you feel for him anyway. Then, as the book goes on I ended up really caring for him and wanted him to have that happily-ever-after with Mia. The romance between Mia and Adam was done seamlessly. These two have a lot of things to work out and the will they/won't they anticipation was there but I was able to enjoy it (I wasn't frustrated and wanting to shake characters like I usually am with this plot device) and just reading about them walk and talk about NYC was like a gift.<br /><br />Everything I loved about IIS was here in WSW--the wonderfully flawed, multi-dimensional characters, the lyrical writing, the music, the flashbacks, the emotional punch--then add the beautiful setting of New York City at night and the very early morning (which I actually did experience years ago)...

B0047Y17P2|1.0|I notice that some people have a problem with reviewers commenting on the Kindle price for this book and others. Turns out that this is the only real forum for readers and fans to let the author and his publisher to know how much we despise this practice. There is no legitimate justification for charging prices for e-books that are higher than physical book prices. None. I won't bother to reiterate all of the costs involved in printing, assembling, and distributing a traditional book--it's all been said before. This is about pure greed and the inability (or unwillingness) of the publishers to alter their business models to treat their loyal customers fairly and incent them to buy more books rather than hesitating each time they look for a new read. Personally, I simple pass on the over priced new releases and either read something older by the author or find someone new to read. If we collectively keep sending the message AND acting accordingly, perhaps the publishers will eventually start treating us like customers they appreciate.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|If you like drama, this movie is for you! Chock full of twists and turns, it challenges the idea of what happens in sci-fi dramas.<br /><br />Sam Rockwell is top notch in this movie- lots of complexity and different personalities. He really makes the movie shine. Moon is similar in tone to Sunshine, but was made with a far smaller budget (you can't tell though!).
B004S699HC|2.0|Got the Crow 2 BD and was comparing it with my DVD and it really is not that much of an upgrade in PQ. It's slightly sharper then the DVD, but not by much. Sound is DTA-HD MA 2.0 and sounds good, but could have been much better. For $10 bucks it's not to bad if you don't have the special edition DVD, if you have the DVD then just stick with that.<br /><br />One thing I did notice was the BD is not the slightly longer Directors Cut like the old special edition DVD.

Their commitment to their goal and refusal to accept less that perfect out of themselves in inspiring. The leaders that took us to the moom seem to have disappeared as quickly as the end of the space program with Apollo 17.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I originally bought this Miniseries for my dad's birthday because he enjoyed HBO's other miniseries, Band of Brothers, so much. Having watched both, we've both agreed that we enjoy watching The Pacific because of how it shows the conditions the soldiers had to live in, and let me tell you, it was not sunny and warm in the Pacific. The characters are easy to like and I found myself saying, \\"Just more one episode, then I'll go to bed...\\" and that one episode became two, and then three, and so on. I even found myself crying on more than one occasion.     I suggest this product a million times over!
B0040QYROK|5.0|If you have never seen this film and you consider yourself a film buff, you must see, and probably should own, this Blu-Ray.  The only thing you should be careful about is buying the correct version.  There are numerous versions out there, make sure you buy one one with the November 2010 release date.  All others will be incorrect.
078681859X|5.0|After hearing great things about this series I decided to finally give it a shot.  Initially, I was skeptical-- after all, the plot sounds like a total rehash of the Harry Potter series.  However, I was pleasantly surprised and even impressed with Stroud's fresh new entry to the fantasy genre.  Most importantly: this is *not* a Harry Potter wannabe series.  While the setting is London and the lead character a 12 year old boy, the plot, characters and composition are entirely unique and very exciting. Stroud incorporates bits of ancient history (Ptolemy, Solomon, Jericho, Prague...) against a fantasy backdrop giving the series a little hint of dystopia.  There are also traditional fantasy elements (summoning djinn, pentacles, eccentric magician attire...) molded into a modern-day England setting. All-in-all this is an excellent start to a clever new series.  I think this series will be appreciated equally by adults and young teens.  Highly recommended! A+
0393327655|4.0|The End of Faith is solid contribution to the heated discussion about what's really ailing mankind.  For starters, faith must go, especially violent faith, and any ancestral belief that stymies genuine human progress.  Harris does a splendid job of roasting the antiquated ethics and militant practices of Islam.  However, he is not apologetic for the ancient or modern beliefs of Christianity.  Quite simply, he's had enough of religion and anything else that's faith-based.  None of it is entirely benign.  There are better ways to discover universal truths about how we ought to live together.  Scientific methods and modern philosophical inquiry bring tremendous leverage to the study of ethics.  On the vast majority of issues, we can objectively decide what is best for most people in the modern world.  Clear thinking about the human condition gives us a powerful antidote against nationalism, bigotry, genocide, child abuse, and personality cults.  Most human endeavors and festering conflicts could benefit from a hefty dose of real fact finding and rational debate about root causes.<br /><br />I am not an optimist.  I think we are more likely to return to a simple, possibly tribal, and perhaps even a subsistence way of life before we attain sustainable peace, justice, and general prosperity throughout the world.  I'd settle for at least basic human rights and a modicum of comfort for everyone.  In that regard, the path forward must be maintained, and books like this one keep brambles from clogging the trail.  Suffice it to say, as his critics have rightly pointed out, that Sam Harris is intolerant of religion in general, however moderate it may be, and any other mumbo jumbo that keeps us mired in a backwater of ancient faith and old morality with its associated personal suffering, economic costs, and international conflicts.  Casting off the brutal vestiges of the 14th century should help us build better societies with sound political systems and as much personal freedom as possible.<br /><br />I was delighted to acquire Sam's book at a library sale and then discover the luminous prose within.  The author has a spectacular command of the English language.  The book is not entirely perfect, but his juxtaposition of things like torture and collateral damage gets you thinking.  He could also have wrote something about the differences between true pacifists and conscientious objectors.  That difference is less than subtle.  He did, however, add a response in the afterword of the paperback edition to address concerns that his ideas about consciousness were an invitation to Eastern mysticism.  In general, the book is a ripping good read.  It positions Mr. Harris rather nicely in the lofty company of Voltaire, Thomas Paine, Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, and Christopher Hitchens.  I recommend it to anyone who stumbled upon Robert Ingersoll, Paul Kurtz, John Shelby Spong, or Michael Shermer and said... Wow, why didn't I know about this stuff 10 years ago?  The End of Faith should be read along with Sam's other books.  He's a young guy.  I'll bet he's just warming up.  Stay tuned.ble.

B004L79VUI|5.0|Actually an outstanding new album. You'll still here the depth of Robertson's emotional connections to the stories being told in each song; what I really like about this album--in addition to the lyrical depth--is the musical arrangements. They are really soothing, yet also have the ability to really move you. I grew up on top 40 to begin with, then moved to the great genre of rock n roll; this album has that constrained feel of ready to rock your socks off, yet it paces itself so that the urge to just explode in exuberant dancing becomes a more measured activity. If you have any liking for Robbie Robertson, this album will definitely please you!

B002ZG976U|4.0|I consider myself a film fanatic, movie know-it-all, and amatuer critic.  I watched this movie fully expecting to hate it.  I watched it again to try and find fault with it, and again when I came to terms with the fact that I was in love.  Of course the plot line is predictable, look at the genre, it's a musical/rom-com.  Beyond that there is something indescribable that pulls you into this movie.  Stanely Tucci is amazing as per usual, Cher is CHER, Christina's voice, body and chemistry with her leading man, the dancing; I haven't yet decided which one of these factors makes me love it so much, but I'll watch it again and again until I figure it out.

1439153663|4.0|This book was really hard to put down.<br />However, I did feel that the author crammed all the negative things she could think of for that time period, and pearled them one by one into this story.

There was also far too much repetition of the \\"treating a child like it's mine\\" theme.<br />Nevertheless, a good read.

B000SGGUWS|3.0|As my review title states if you are currently watching the T.V. series don't waste your time with the book series. First of all they are completely different...and that's not a bad thing. The book series is a MESS. The characters are spiteful little brats that only worry about themselves. I only read the first four books because that's all I could stand. I started to really dislike all the girls and it almost ruined the T.V. series for me. Sara Shepherd has some imagination. Just when you think it's the absolute worse it can get she throws in more garbage, just plain ridiculous!!! I never say I like the T.V. version better than the book; but in this case I definitely did. ABC family had a lot of cleaning up to do.
0316098337|4.0|Five-year-old Jack stands as our narrator throughout this story. Jack is a little boy who was born to a woman being held hostage by a man who kidnapped her 7 years earlier when she was 19 years old.    Jack has known nothing outside of Room (Jack thinks of everything as being alive, so the names of objects takes on more meaning for Jack, as they are the \\"names\\" of living things. They are his friends.) Room is the entire world, and as far as he knows, there is nothing in the world outside of Room, his mother, and his mother's kidnapper (and his father) Old Nick.    I had a little difficulty adjusting to the child's perspective of this book. It takes awhile to get the hang of having so many inanimate objects with names (Remote, Bed, Rug, Door, Wardrobe), and to get inside the mind of a child.    Jack is smart. At times he is too smart, leaving me feeling at times that I'm reading an unrealistic portrayal of a little boy. And typical of children, he can be quite self-centered and lack a certain consideration for his poor troubled mother.    His mother's total focus is Jack. While Room is Jack's world, Jack is his mother's world. One can only imagine what life was like for his mother before Jack, trapped day-in and day-out in a single room all by herself, and raped and brutalized with no end in sight. Then one day Jack is born, and there is suddenly something to focus on and live for.    So in short, this book was pretty good. It kept me hanging on, wanting to know what would happen next, and how things would work out for them. However it wasn't quite as good as I had hoped for. It just seemed a little...I don't know...empty. There wasn't much excitement or anything. It was more psychologically-based than I really expected. But good nonetheless, and a satisfying read in the end.
0307474712|5.0|I really loved this book from beginning to end. It was so well written even though we just got glimpses into the characters lives. Weird to say but I loved their disfunction and the entire time I am willing Em and Dex to be together. While I am a sucker for a happy ending, my heart was broken at the end but I absolutely loved it and cannot wait to see this book as a movie!  A must read for all!!

Overall, I was really disappointed with this product granted I only played Call of Duty Black Ops. If you are coming straight from pc to ps3 this might be for you. If your trying to find something other than your Frag v.2 or any other type of similar product stay away from this. Frag v.2 seems to be the best bet as long as you can keep it from breaking. Hopefully Splitfish's Shark is better.

It was an entertaining read and I would recommend it to any techy looking to get away for a bit, but not really get away. Being a \\"Jeff\\"-type myself, I was hoping for a touch more technical detail in the book. At the same time I can understand not wanting to get too technical. The ending was a little vague, but you get the idea of what happened.    I hope Mark writes another similar adventure soon.
0316172324|4.0|In Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell explains that \\"thin-slicing\\", the ability to sum up a situation and make decisions and assumptions based on very little time and what seems like very little information, is sometimes as good or better than making decisions after lots of thought and research. He gives the reader lots of examples including salesmen, war tactics, firemen, hospitals, job hiring, science, museums, and relationships, among many others. I find that the examples are fascinating because it seems like there is a lot of truth in it all. People give the subconscious much less credit than it deserves. By \\"thin-slicing\\", one's subconscious makes decisions and choices all day long even when one does not feel like they are actually doing so. One's subconscious can pick up on little thoughts and indications that sometimes one does not even know they have.   However, Gladwell also addresses the fact that sometimes one's subconscious can make the wrong decision based on biases that one may not even be aware of. Therefore, there is a time and a place for snap judgments, or \\"thin-slicing\\", but there is also a time and a place for careful and detailed research and analysis. His examples at the beginning are very strong but as the book goes on they get more and more vague and disconnected from what seemed like his main point originally. Overall though I enjoyed the book and found it very interesting because the stories and examples are engaging and amusing.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|Can not say enough about this show - easily the best I have seen in years.  This season was fantastic due in large part to John Lithgow's character.  The only downside to the series for me is the Deb Morgan character.  Just wish someone would put a couple of bullets in her and her vulgar vocabulary.  Oh wait, someone did but she still lived.  She is seriously irritating.  Can't wait for season 5 to comeo out!!!

0756404738|4.0|I agree with a lot of reviewers who were frustrated by the lack of resolution and the fact that Kvothe is still at the University... and his relationship with Denna is now bordering on silly (and it is true, she has moved from mysterious to irritating). BUT (and that is a big \\"but\\") I like being immersed in this world. I like the taverns and the music and the folks met on the road and the exploration of different cultures and languages. Rothfuss is an excellent writer. Decriptions of food, drink, financial woes, Kvothe's room at Amkers - I am into it. I am in for the entire ride, come what may. I trust Rothfuss to tie everything up and to do it well. My only real complaint with WMF is the incredibly long, tedious romp in the hay with the fairy sex pot. The whole encounter could have been contained to one or two chapters rather than a quarter of the book.

B0047Y17P2|1.0|I am a huge Michael Connelly fan and have been waiting for a month to get my Kindle edition of The Fifth Witness. Sadly, I won't be purchasing what I am sure is a marvelously told story because I can't bring myself to pay more than the hardcover edition would cost. I bought my Kindle for several reasons, one of which was a belief in the hype that promised reasonable pricing for most new books. That seems to have gone by the wayside with this offering. While I understand that \\"the publisher sets the price\\", I cannot believe that Amazon does not have some say in the pricing of books they offer. I will get on the waiting list at my local library to read Mr. Connelly's book. I have happily bought all of his other Mickey Haller offerings and several of the Harry Bosch books. I find it a shame that I don't feel I can support the pricing for this one. I cannot believe that it costs more to scan a book electronically than it does to print, publish and ship an actual copy. I take it as an insult to my intelligence and to my trust as a faithful customer.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Like many others, I am besotted with Adele. The only wrinkle I have with this album is that the version of \\"Someone Like You\\" on the album is not as good as her live performances (e.g. the ones on You Tube).  It is overproduced, and she also makes some note choices that detract from the simplicity of the emotion.   There is an interesting YouTube video where she talks about each of the songs -- they should have included maybe a transcript of it in the album.       Still, better than everything else out there, period.

B0034G4P7G|3.0|I've been looking forward to finally getting around to watching this movie for a long while. I thought it'd be right up my alley - I'm all about geek-dom and such.<br /><br />To be honest, I watched this movie over a period of 3 evenings in short spurts. I don't know if my reaction to the movie is all thanks to not watching it in one fell-swoop, but I only thought it to be okay. It was a little lackluster and the plot was a little open-ended, which, I'd think, is somewhat to be expected with a subject such as this. It seemed unfinished and didn't really have much of a climax. There wasn't much to keep my interest - nothing exciting.<br /><br />All in all, I think the only thing I came away with was the knowledge that Mark Zuckerberg was pretty much not a nice fellow. By the end, he was a tiny bit redeemable, but not enough for me to root for him as the hero.<br /><br />One great note, however, was the acting. The leads were very well cast and, for the most part, they were a delight to watch.<br /><br />It's good, just not great. I won't go out of my way to watch again.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm not going to repeat the plot of this wonderful series since so many others have talked about it at length.  I'd just like to say that the best endorsement I can give THE WALKING DEAD is to say I am definitely not a fan off horror films (in fact, I hate them), but got completely hooked on this series while channel surfing one evening!.   I was mystified that I would actually watch something that under ordinary circumstances I would avoid like the plague (no pun intended)!  I think I was drawn by the superb writing and amazing production values.  The characters are not cardboard cutouts of what you'd expect in genre filmmaking of this type - they are complex, distinct personalities that I became wholly invested in.  And the special effects are beyond amazing for a TV series!  I don't fully understand why only six episodes were done in the first season, and why we have to wait until close to 2012 for season two, but I will definitely be tuning in when it returns to the airwaves.

0316069353|1.0|I feel compelled to add my voice to the howl of protest about the pricing of the Kindle version of this book.  The thing is, when one buys an e-book, one doesn't get a physical object.

Considering the scope and size of this 360 stage; the state of the art cameras flying and rotating bring you to a place that is simply unattainable from being there live and actually brings the \\"concert experience\\" or should I say Reexperience? to a whole new level.<br />Millions of people watched this unparalleled theatrical show live around the globe. It starts with a powerful, nearly flawless, version of \\"Get on your Boots\\" and \\"Magnificent\\"  and encouraging performances of \\"Beautiful Day\\" \\"In a little while\\" \\"until the end of the World\\" (incredible Camera work) \\"The unforgettable fire\\", \\"I'll go Crazy\\" is enlightening. Later in the show a message to Iran, \\"This is United States Calling\\" to \\"all who love freedom\\" for those persecuted in Iranian prisons followed by an emotional version of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" It is profound to see the fans singing along with \\"Amazing grace\\" leading into \\"Where the streets have no name\\" or witness music transcend politics and borders in SO Cal during \\"Vertigo\\"... & wrapping up with an awesome version of \\"Moment Of Surrender\\"<br />Each song performed that evening has it's own little story. No other band has been able to generate this type of global response & bring a genuine intimacy to this SIZE of a venue. It is really quite amazing and quite honestly super natural, in its own \\"mysterious way\\"<br /><br />Before watching this show I did not care too much for their new album... but now I am discovering new things about each song as I watch this memorable evening in 2009 that was captured on film.<br /><br />Regarding poor reviews...<br />What the whiners do not understand (Now I know why Bono wrote the song with or without you) is that this show was in Los Angeles!! the whole concert is geared to honor Hollywood and LA! that includes special effects and color!!  and this is supposed to be through the eyes of a spaceship!<br />At the intro, the Ariel view of the Rose Bowl completely filled with a enormous crowd glowing in Neon Blue is unprecedented... People complaining about a \\"grainy\\" look to this HD concert? Maybe they did not notice that they used colored lighting almost exclusively?? HD is not going to have a \\"SHARP\\" picture you expect in this type of lighting environment!!<br />In my opinion it was refreshingly different, with almost surreal type effects the band & fans at times seem to glow in neon colors almost like a blend between Tron, Terminator and Fantasia!! The fast switching is executed between the musicians and the songs in a genius type manner, catching the emotions of the band and venue dancing back and forth between every note of their dynamic and ever changing music & melodies.<br />The audio recording & mixing with \\"360\\" surround in Dolby Digital is awesome!<br />After 30 years of singing Rock and Roll and touring more than any other band...

B004GYY714|5.0|I LOVE this app! I can now get my Boston area sports radio living in PA and ANYWHERE! Easy to use and a surprisingly large selection.

0143113100|5.0|\\"The Brain that Changes Itself\\" gives us a whole new way to look at the workings of the brain. For many years we've been taught that it is simple a machine. This line of thought didn't allow for the brain to change but remain cold, hard and only programmable. However, Dr. Doige explains something totally different citing various case studies. He discusses the possibility (and probability) that the brain has a sort of plasticity that allows it to reroute input. When part of the brain is damaged rather than it being irreversible it will simply reroute signals and use a different part of the brain to perform tasks. This is a very informative book and super enlightening as well.
B0000VD04M|5.0|\\"Ed Wood\\" is about Ed Wood, a film director who was very good at making bad movies. The film is directed by Tim Burton and Johnny Depp plays the title character and the movie is a biopic about a real person. After seeing this movie when I was a kid I was inspired to make home-made movies with a camcorder. It is not fair that everyone who makes it into show business has to be talented so occasionally their has to be an Ed Wood to break the ice. Ed Wood wasn't a mere mediocrity. He was a disaster.    In the movie Ed Wood is an aspiring film maker living during either the 1940s or 1950s, and he's got the spirit but not the talent. He makes a go at showbusiness thinking he'll be the next Orson Welles and boy is he wrong. He can win people over in an interview but when it comes to making movies, his movies aren't just bad, they're incompetent.    Johnny Depp's performance in this movie is awesome. He's really funny in the movie and acting in strange films seems to be his talent. Martin Landau is great as Bela Lugosi. He reveals what exactly was so funny about Bela Lugosi's performance in Glen and Glenda. Martin Landau won an academy award for his performance and rightly so. Bill Murray is also hilarious.     After seeing this movie I then saw several of Ed Wood's movies and watched a documentary on him called \\"Ed Wood: Look Back in Angora\\", so this is a movie that convinced me to watch other movies. The movie Ed Wood is better than any movie that Ed Wood made, and not only that, it is a magnificent movie.
1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki has written a wonderful book on influence. Sort of a \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" for the digital age. My copy is dog eared, highlighted, and bookmarked with notes in the margins. A lot of the books that I've read on marketing yourself, business, product, whatever, are dry and boring; not this one. Guy writes with such great humor and is so knowledgeable that you find yourself devouring every chapter.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to successfully influence people with an everyone wins mentality. I love that Guy looks at situations in a way that makes it possible for everyone to benefit and I adore the personal stories and snippets. Great book from a really bright, influential man with a terrific sense of humor.

B004CIIXC8|5.0|Adolescence is a difficult time for most everybody, even people lucky enough to grow up in stable homes with loving parents. \\"Fish Tank\\" is an unflinching portrait of female adolescence, featuring a character stuck in a situation that is anything but favorable.<br /><br />Mia is an angry 15 year old girl living in a housing project with her mother and little sister. Her mother is more interested in drinking and partying than she is in being a parent, and throughout the film it's clear that she just wants to get rid of Mia, who she is beginning to see as sexual competition. Mia seems to have no real friends in the neighborhood, and with her quick temper, is constantly scuffling with the other local kids. For the most part, she seems completely neglected and alone.<br /><br />One day, a handsome, shirtless man named Connor appears in the kitchen in the morning; a \\"friend\\" of Mia's Mother. Mia is immediately attracted to Connor, although she also feels the need to antagonize him since he's invading her territory. Connor appears, for a while, to only have a playful, paternal interest in Mia. However, when he gets drunk one night and finds himself alone with Mia, his true lecherous intentions are revealed.<br /><br />Mia's relationship with Connor reveals a sad truth ... that often troubled young girls are targeted by older men, who use their vulnerability as a way to exploit them sexually. Mia, an aspiring dancer, also finds herself in a similar situation when she thinks she wins a \\"dancing\\" audition that turns out to be nothing more than a casting call for strippers. And when Connor betrays Mia after their ill-advised sexual encounter, Mia goes off the deep end, with near disastrous consequences.<br /><br />The film ends on an ambiguous note: Mia is neglected and damaged for sure, but she's also a scrappy survivor. Mia will survive and maybe even thrive ... despite the failure and irresponsibility of the \\"adults\\" in her life.<br /><br />\\"Fish Tank\\" is sort of a companion piece to another film I've seen, \\"Towelhead\\" that also explores issues of adolescent trauma, confusion, isolation, and sexual exploitation. However, in my opinion (sorry, Alan Ball, love ya!) \\"Fish Tank\\" is the superior film.elhead\\" that also explores issues of adolescent trauma, confusion, isolation, and sexual exploitation.

B002ZG976U|5.0|OMG! This movie is AMAZING! I had seen this movie in the theaters, and was VERY excited when I did. Honestly, pairing Christina Aguilera and Cher in a film that involves singing not only combines two of the greatest female vocalists of our time, but also creates a multi generational gathering for the pros that grew up with Cher when she was with Sonny, aNd the people that have grown up with Christina. The music in this film is wonderful, combining today pop sound with the sounds of the old burlesque cabarets, and the cast couldn't be better! Stanley Tucci always puts in a top notch performance, but add Kristen Bell, and Peter Gallagher, and you've definitely got a hit! I LOVED this movie. Usually when a musician stars in a movie, it spells the end for his/her career (unless you're Cher), but Christina definitely keeps you listening to every song that is in this movie with her amazing voice. This match was definitely made in heaven, and I applaud whomever is responsible for pairing Christina and Cher together.
0812550706|5.0|Enders Game is a book peering into the future of human civilization. It explores the possibilities of a world twice invaded and torn by an alien race. With clear and obvious weakness, the human race rallies together, setting aside wars and international disputes, to defend its hopeful future. Despite having suffered great loss and having no sure guarantee of victory, they prepare for a certain third invasion in an unusual way. They search their young to find some child with the potential to become the greatest war hero the human race has ever known, and they find Ender Wiggin.   This was a particularly enjoyable book to read. I enjoyed the character development of Ender, Valentine, Peter, and several of the military leaders. It was never quite clear or obvious what plots were brewing in their minds. It was as much of a task for me as it was for Ender to determine what the military leaders were up to. I found myself deeply interested in the activities taking place and was easily enveloped in Ender's world.    I also found the conflicts being depicted quite thought provoking. There seemed to be controversy about the military's approach to conducting business as well as the meaning of the alien invasions. I found much of Valentine's and Peter's role in the book to be a way to discuss politics and policy taking place in their time, which I found quite interesting. I enjoyed thinking to myself and attempting to determine my own opinions about the various topics discussed. The author did an excellent job of allowing the reader to think about the topics of controversy for themselves and ponder upon them. I personally can see how much of the politics and policy discussed would have relevance in our world today.     If you enjoy a good science-fiction novel every now and again, this one is probably for you. Although it is listed as a children's book, it has many grown up qualities that I believe most adults would find enjoyable.     Daniel Elison  Heyburn, Id.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|Classic Disney movie! The only thing that bothered me was her hair turns brown when the magic leaves. I feel that sends a slightly negative message to little girls with brown hair. However, young kids might not pick up on it. Other than that adorable movie!

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Ok so I wasn't looking for long so there might be better and more feature rich apps that do the same thing but I don't think I'll need one. It works just as advertised and way faster and easier than I thought it would. I tried the free version and within 10 seconds it was working so 30 seconds later I figured that it was easily worth a dollar. It tells you what website to go too and bingo your ready to copy files. I copied songs from my SD card purchased on amazon mp3 to a friends computer that quickly and easily. It's better than carrying around a microUSB cable because you cart lose it.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I love the blu-ray. The episodes are clear, clean, and colorful. I love how I have the option of seeing it as originally released or with the space scenes effects updated/modernized.<br /><br />No matter which view I choose, I can switch back and forth whenever I want. I still love this collection (can't wait for season 2 & 3 to arrive) and would recommend it to anyone who loves Star Trek and wants to see TOS it as it should have been from day one.<br /><br />My only nit is that they didn't clean up the pictures with the end credits. Since they could have easily replaced them with the exact same pictures from the cleaned up episodes & just put fresh text on top, this seems a strange omission. It doesn't make me hate it, it's just a minor annoyance.<br /><br />Update: I've just gotten through watching \\"Court Martial\\" on Disc 5 and noticed a 'pulsing' in brightness that went from annoying to almost unnoticeable. It hasn't happened on any other episode as yet. I'll contact the studio and see if they've had that problem and have replacement discs.
B000VLE3GA|4.0|This has got to be one of the best classic rock bands' greatest hits CDs.

I tried playing it on a number of disk players in the house and its the same spots giving me grief.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I generally don't like cg movies because i tend to associate them with childhood movies that used cg, however their are exceptions that bend that. Four words: I loved this movie!! This movie sits next to \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" in my small pile of \\"must love\\" movies. I have the original DVD of this movie when it released in 2005, and I must say that this version is much more crisp, beautifully done, very vivid colors, i don't mind the abnormal jumping abilities, the music is wonderful and fits the scenes well, and the story is more complete (hence the name). all the extra 30 minutes of deleted scenes was well worth it and beautifully done. if your a fan of the final fantasy universe or specifically final fantasy 7, you'll love this cg movie. major kudos to Square-Enix.    however, you have to know what happened in the game to know what is specifically going on in the movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|the level design, especially in the first chapter, is wonderful. love the new animals instead of the pigs again too! the caged birds were fun and easy and the monkeys more challenging. cant wait to see whats next! the interface is also way better, less scrolling! better pop-ups when a level is over and better story-telling slides too. overall better looking. love this game!

B004TL0J5M|1.0|Here is one more avid reader who agrees with the other aggrieved Amazon eBook purchasers that the Kindle price should not be higher than the hard cover price.

B001BKG9SK|4.0|Really enjoyed both the CD's and DVD's. Was a little disappointed that the first four CD tracks (Speak to Me, Breathe, Time and Breathe (reprise)) were not included on the DVD. Don't really know why they weren't included since there were several \\"Barn Jams\\" that could have allowed enough space for those tracks. That said it is still a worthwhile purchase. Quality of the DVD photography was great.
0316069353|5.0|When this book first came out I saw the Publisher's price for Kindle and I was so upset by their greediness that I gave this book a one star rating.  Now after reading the book I would like to offer my apology to Michael Connelly and give it the rating it deserves.  I've read every book of his as they came out, from Black Echo on and loved watching him develop as writer.  All of his books deserve 5 stars and if you are new to his books start with number one and enjoy them all.

Also, it is good to stay \\"present\\" in every step in your way to reach your goal, because each one, is a learning experience. However, I found this book a basic reading. I guess the reason is because I had read so many interesting books about personal development that, I didn't find anything new. I recommend this book for beginners who want to learn about this topic.
B003XMUFGQ|2.0|Eric Clapton has been a part of my musical life, all my life.  However, this latest endeavor is very disapointing.

B004FN16DS|5.0|This book has really challenged me to see the way in which the world is organized in much more nuanced manner than I have become accustomed to seeing it after spending a decade in Corporate Finance. It does a remarkable job of demonstrating just how our economic system is failing most of us, but it does so while recommending practical solutions to make things better.     Many in the US on right that align themselves with Reaganomics still like to argue that the current system is failing because of too much regulation, too many taxes, and a distribution system that supports far too generous welfare benefits that make the rest us lazy. Chang actually turns the argument around and says that most people would be better off if the welfare state was stronger because entrepreneurs would be more willing to take chances and innovate if the risks weren't as great as they currently are. I know from experience that many in the corporate sector won't leave their current jobs to take on such endeavors, because doing currently involves too much risk to their families. Chang goes on to demonstrate how other countries with more robust welfare benefits actually outperform the US. This is just one example of major flaws in the current system that Chang points out.     I would highly recommend this book for someone who wants a nuanced perspective on what's wrong with our current system and what can be done to improve it.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|As we all know,  a film's critical review is a subjective journey.<br />Many have universally praised  Taxi Driver an American masterpiece.<br />In my humble opinion,  it is Scorsese's crowning achievement.<br />I won't bother you a with a critical review of the narrative itself,  the power of the performances, the lush cinematography not to mention the haunting soundtrack.<br /><br />Lets get down to brass tacks with the  Blu-ray experience:<br /><br />The new 4K transfer and remastering ( under cinematographer Michael Chapmen and Scorsese's supervision ) looks fantastic. I can only hope for more studios to take their time when transferring vintage masterpieces.  The clarity, color and detail even surpasses my last film-screening of this film at the Hollywood Cinerama Dome  in the mid-90s.  The soundtrack is presented in 5.1 DTS HD with wonderful results.<br /><br />The special features are chock full of goodies, too numerous for me to list here fully:<br />I really enjoyed the \\"screen to script interactive\\", and also the \\"storyboard to film comparisons\\".  Multiple documentaries are included in this single BR disc, including \\"Travis' New York \\" The changes of New York 1975 to Today\\" Multiple interviews and commentaries with both Scoreses and writer Paul Schrader + much more supplementary material.<br /><br /> The Picture Quality at 1080P was like peanut butter to jelly on my 52\\" LCD XBR,  and switching the images to a 150\\" screen (  via Sony VPL-VW50 1080P projector ) was like adding a couple strips of crispy bacon to that peanut butter sandwich. If you are into HT and projection systems,  this BR disc is made for you.  Seeing New York City in the mid 70s presented in such detail and color was a visually arresting experience. The vibrant night shots really stays with you,  vivid colors pop during those long tracking POV shots from Travis's cab. A museum quality documentation on NYC street-life during that period.<br /><br />The packaging is robust, with a 3 section pullout-type case that holds the bonus lobbycards.<br /><br />This is the definitive copy.  ( at least until The  Criterion Collection decides to give it a BR go ).<br /><br />Yes folks,  for a small price,  its time to get into Travis's Taxi for a cinematic ride like no other.This is the definitive copy.

B004P4S4NM|1.0|What do you get when you mix a pig with a skinned cat? The answer is Adele.   I am floored by the number of people (mostly over-the-hill soccer moms trying to feel relevant) that think this is the greatest singer of all time.   I've heard better singers not make it past the first round of American Idol. She can't carry a tune without her voice cracking. And don't tell me that gives her singing character. It is rubbish and that is where this CD belongs, in the trash.
B00466HN6S|5.0|This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. It was heart-warming, and had the right amount of comedy suitable for any age. E.B. was adorable and hilarious. Russell Brand was the perfect choice. E.B.'s dad is retiring and wants his son to continue on and become the new Easter Bunny, but E.B. doesn't want that life. He runs away to Hollywood to start a new life, but is almost run over by a slacker named Fred O'Hare. Fred is having trouble with his family as well. While Fred is house sitting, E.B. decides to crash with him. Back at Easter Island, a chick named Carlos plots to take over the Easter holiday, unless Fred and E.B. can stop him.

0240815807|5.0|Worth every penny. I have [[ASIN:0240520688 Mixing Audio: Concepts, Practices and Tools]] by Roy Izhaki as well as [[ASIN:1598632515 The Mixing Engineer's Handbook, Second Edition]].  If you are mixing at home with a computer, Senior's book is all you need. I would buy Izhaki's book if you have the spare cash.  Izhaki's book is more detailed and less aimed at the home studio but it is a mixing knowledge treasure trove.  If you have both books you're pretty well equipped to put out a good mix.    If you're serious about mixing buy \\"Mixing Secrets.\\"    If you are interested in mastering your own music you can take a look at [[ASIN:1598633929 Mastering Music at Home (Book)]]. This book lets in you in on techniques to master your music using professional recordings as a reference.  [[ASIN:0240808371 Mastering Audio, Second Edition: The art and the science]] is good to have but not essential IMHO.    The \\"pro's\\" will tell you not to mix and master your own music. Well, who has the money to hire a mixer and pay for a professional mastering job? I know there are online mastering services that will master your tracks for $50 a pop. I doubt they'll do a better job than I will at home.    The modern digital musician has to be self-sufficient.  We can't wait around for record contracts to give us the money and tools we need to release our music.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|Tron: Legacy is an empty film with no ideas, almost a retread of the original with updated graphics but much lower stakes.  It's almost an insult to the original film, which, while not a classic, at least brought up some heady subjects like the nature of reality and free will.  Tron never took itself too seriously, but it wasn't just playing around either.  It had a good mix of action, story, solid acting, and the cool visuals of what a 1980's computer network might look like.  Tron: Legacy makes some noises about being about something, but it's full of undeveloped ideas, a complete idiot plot, and, aside from the grid games in the beginning of the film, some pretty dull visuals.  The action stops for a good 2/3rds of the film while the characters explain, explain, and explain some more in an effort to make the plot make sense.  They fail.  Nothing that happens in the film makes any sense if you think about it for 5 minutes.  The only good parts of the film are the score, which really is outstanding, and the grid games that happen about 20 minutes into the movie.  Other than that, the film is 30 minutes too long, and the ending is hilariously absurd, essentially invalidating most of the ideas that came before.  It's such an empty movie.  The stakes are so low for a film that seems to think it's \\"about something\\", when really it seems like a cynical cash grab from Disney.  Save your money and your time.  Rent the original and play the Daft Punk Legacy score over it.
1591391105|5.0|Last November, I joined a new Company.  The new Company is much smaller than the previous two Fortune 500 companies I worked for.

In addition it goes a step further than the others in tackling a major<br />social, ethical, and economic problem in the U.S. today.<br /><br />Almost all the reviews accumulated here are attacks on the cost of the book.

Cut to Japan where the 7th Angel is attacking Tokyo-3, but is defeated by the timely arrival of Capt. Asuka and Unit-02. Asuka ends up moving in with Shinji in Misato's apartment, where we're treated to a very fanservish-retake of Shinji's discovery of Pen Pen. Shinji is introduced to Misato's ex-boyfriend Kaji, who in secret delivers a mysterious package to Gendo. The 8th Angel then attacks from orbit, and all three Eva units work together to stop it from bellyflopping on NERV headquarters. Asuka actually takes a turn for the different at this point in the story as she starts to opening up to Shinji, and even Rei, more proven with the poignant elevator scene where they both realize they have alot more in common than before. Rei tries to arrange a dinner meeting between Shinji and his father, and invites most of the NERV regulars. Asuka politely declines to be the test pilot for Unit-03, although it gets possessed by the 9th Angel. With Asuka trapped inside, Unit-03 stomps its way to NERV. Unlike in the TV series where Shinji wouldn't attack the evil Eva because he can't bring himself to kill another person(even though at the time he didn't know it was his friend Toji), he realizes that Asuka is in it, and refuses to stop Unit-03. Gendo pulls a supreme act of dickery by switching Unit-01 to automatic mode with a dummy system, and it tears the crap out of Unit-03, even more than it really needed to. I mean, did it really need to chomp the entry plug with Asuka in it? The Angel was already dead by then! Anyway, Shinji quits just as the 10th Angel appears, and Mari counterattacks inside Unit-02 as Asuka is still in recovery. Even going into \\"beast mode\\", Mari can't stop it. Rei appears in the still-damaged Unit-00 and tries to shove a nuke down the Angel's throat, but the Angel devours Rei in Unit-00, and then mutates into being part giant naked Rei(shades of End Of Evangelion?). Mari happens to find Shinji, and carries him in Unit-02 to Unit-01. After being bruised, Unit-01 ascends into a higher lifeform, and plows through the metaphysical mush of the Angel to bring Rei out. Now, at this point, the movie looks like its going to end with Unit-01 bringing about a premature 3rd Impact, but if you stay to the end of the closing credits, Kaworu comes down from the moon in Unit-06 and spears Unit-01 with what is supposed to be several Lance of Longinus, which puts the brakes on 3rd Impact, as least for now.<br /><br />There's alot more progress made in this film in the story and characters than in the original TV series. Asuka seems to have a less traumatic past, and opens up alot more. In other words, Asuka is less of a b-i-t-c-h! Shinji has gained more confidence than in the first movie, but withouth getting all cocky as he seemed to in the series. Rei is less introverted, and shows more than just her \\"motherly\\" concerns toward Shinji. The addition of Mari was mostly unnecessary, as the character didn't add too much more to the movie that couldn't have been filled in by any of the rest of the cast, but it is possible that it was done to set her up for a more important role in the next two movies. The animation in this is of course far better than the original anime, especially in the Eva fights. Asuka's \\"Rider Kick\\" entrance is pure gold! The dub is still pretty good too, with TiffanyGrant returning as Asuka, and the same from the first movie's English cast. Unlike the initial release of Evangelion 1.0, Funimation went ahead in did the Evangelion 2.22 release with the bonus features included, instead of just the regular 2.0. If you can stand to wait the extra 3-4 years it'll take to catch the rest of the new Eva movies, then you'll want to grab Part Two.as Asuka, and the same from the first movie's English cast.

B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I loaded and unloaded and re-loaded 3 or 4 times. Each time my Android was sluggish and difficult to operate the game. At level 7 or 8 my phone would lock up and I rod have to pull the battery to re start the phone. This happened every time I loaded the game. I,finally gave up after 3 or 4 tries.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Who would have thought Disney still had it in them!? I found a couple instances where I would say they tried a little to hard to make something funny, a classic Disney 'he just stepped in the #2' moment that made us laugh the first time and now it's just old, then again it is a kids movie more so and simple humor is sometimes best.    I loved right after she gets out of the tower, it was perfect. Yep, she's definitely a woman, then the guy half trying to figure out what he should do. Yep, that guy is a man.
0756405890|5.0|I don't think I've read any other book - particularly one this length - at such a lightning speed, and it only took me two sessions to devour the entire thing. Rothfuss has crafted one of the best fantasy books I've ever read, and I'm desperate for more. Kvothe is the sort of character you should dislike, if not exactly despise, but Rothfuss has made him all-too-human, even though he displays some miraculous traits at times. The Name Of The Wind gives us details as we need them, not in laborious infodumps like some authors are wont to do. And you won't want to put the book down once you've started.    PROS:  - addictive as hell  - a beautifully realised world seen through the eyes of a flawed and fascinating main character  - utterly compelling from beginning to end  - the time-hopping framework works beautifully  - Rothfuss spares us with infodumps, feeding us information in a way that feels natural and essential to the story    CONS:  - nit-picking, really, but the main female character Denna is annoying  - some may not like the first person perspective, especially those used to the Erikson/Martin/Jordan style  - it ended    SUMMARY:  One of the most addictive novels - fantasy or otherwise - I've ever read. Drop everything else you're reading and get this NOW.
0060775858|5.0|We've had this for 12 months now (we got when baby was 6 months) and it's still in the bedtime rotation. I  would say best for ages 6-18 months. Great book!
0743289692|5.0|I am not a fan of autobiographies since it is very difficult for someone to maintain one's objectivity when writing about oneself. Hirsi Ali, however, does an excellent job with her memoirs. Her book has stirred a lot of emotions. She does not set out to purposefully invoke anger for the sake of it, unlike the Florida preacher who had a burning of Quran ceremony which resulted in unnecessary violence. Ali merely tells readers her life story. Towards the end of the book we find out that she has become an atheist and become vocal in women's rights. This book is about her physical and intellectual journey and it is amazing that Muslims have been so offended to want her dead.     Ali alludes to a new issue towards the end of her book which I thought was a novel concept for Westerners to consider. She points out to the atrocities especially against women that are prevalent in \\"free\\" countries. It begs the question how can the West spend so much of its resources to protect freedom as it is doing in Libya or Afghanistan when there is so much abuse right under its nose? She refers to violence against women practiced by Muslim immigrants such as honor killings and female genital mutilation.  Why is the US so tolerant of the regime in Saudi Arabia when they clearly are one of the biggest violators of human rights? Cynics may attribute our friendliness towards Saudi Arabia to the regime's willingness to provide us with oil. We cannot have it both ways - criticize Libya and Iraq for human rights abuses while ignoring barbarian practices by our allies. \\"The arc of a moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\\" On the positive side the Dutch, US and Danish governments have done an admirable job in protecting this brave woman's free speech.    No matter how you feel about Ali's politics, \\"Infidel\\" is a worthwhile read. Educational and delightful read!

B004JAUCOQ|3.0|This is pretty great, actually... I feel like I'm living in L.A. again, 1991, waiting for Dino's headlining gig with opener Nirvana... however, I'm a drummer and i sure miss some percussion on this one. but it does get J's message across: we gotta go on, with thin strands of long, white hair and bigger bellies. we gotta go on!  ... but, i dunno, i feel like 'Green Mind' was maybe a sadder affair- and less american sounding, btw... the suns shines today, but maybe it should be rainy? beautiful, as usual, that's for sure... and i keep wondering if Mascis gets his melodies not only form Neil Young, but also from old TV shows or commercials? get it, cry, sob sob sob, and then discover the majesty of 'Green Mind' (including the great drumming!).
B003F3NEBG|4.0|I give the actual mini-series 5 stars but i was not impressed with this blue ray version. it did not live up to my expectation of blue ray discs. It's not worth the cost of replacing the non blue ray.
B0038BBA4I|3.0|Pitchfork gave this album a very very low rating. IS that justified? Perhaps, if you are analyzing in a jaded indie frame of mind. Will this appeal to indie lovers of bands like Deerhoof? Not likely. The lyrics are straightforward and insincere. The tunes however, are catchy enough, and make the morning commute somewhat bearable. Is it worth a ten dolllar purchase? for me, no. If you can get it for free and need some new music- you won't be disappointed.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I've seen a lot of reviews giving this book just one star over as a protest to the pricing. Is that really necessary? I understand the frustration, as it seems that customers are being gouged, but taking that frustration out on Mr. Connelly doesn't seem right. Say your piece in your review, and then give the story itself a fair rating. It isn't right to punish the author as I'm sure he's not the one making out like a bandit with the pricing, but rather his publisher. Again, I REALLY understand the frustration, charging more for the kindle edition as opposed to the hardback is patently ridiculous, but do bear in mind that the hardback is on sale. At least we aren't being charged shipping ;-)
B002RD446E|5.0|Just when you feel exhausted by the lack of really great originality in a genre, something like this comes out.  This album is deep, layered, complex, hard hitting, emotional and I can't get enough of it.

B001Q8FRNA|5.0|this cd is amazing, I saw the documentary movie and was hooked on the group. In my opinion they were the forefathers of punk forget the sex pistols,ramones etc. This is stuff that piss people off and also make them dance. I do not know why they were never considered. Really wild stuff all tracks are great.

B00338QENI|5.0|The reviews were great for this book so I got it through my Kindle and have enjoyed it very much.  Working in the healthcare field, it was an eye opener to learn how patients, especially black were treated not so long ago.  The story gives us a perspective on how society and healthcare have evolved in the last 50 years.
0316056863|5.0|I would say your enjoyment of this book is directly proportional to how you already feel about Tina Fey. For my part, I think she's the shiznit (can I say that on Amazon?). I don't see this book so much as a memoir but more as a series of vignettes or essays based on her life. She vaguely tries to give \\"life lessons,\\" largely tongue in cheek, but with a kernel of truth at its center. The book doesn't really hang together as a cohesive unit, but that's not what I was looking for (nor do I think that was Fey's intention). It's more like a selection of humorous essays, a la David Foster Wallace (she even makes a reference to his collection *A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again*). And as the latter, it functions extremely well.     Reading this book is like sitting down and having coffee with Tina Fey as she regales you with the crazy stories from her life. I was a little disappointed that some of this material is verbatim from her speech at the Mark Twain Award, but most of the material is fresh, and I found myself laughing out loud numerous times, something I have never done while reading David Sedaris. I particularly enjoyed the section where she responds to anonymous online flames with that faux-oblivious, I-have-no-idea-you're-making-fun-of-me sweetness with a vicious undercurrent of putdowns that is emblematic of both Tina Fey and of what women often must do in order to state their opinions stealthily and effectively.    The writing is, predictably, sharp, self-deprecating, and sometimes completely bizarre. Her insider look at the biz is both fascinating and depressing. No, this book won't make you turn away from your life of petty crime and meth addiction, but you'll laugh a lot and also just want to hug the people you love (your meth dealer, etc.).    In the end, the stories Fey relates as well as the book itself prove wrong all those a-holes who say women can't be funny.    If you're not a fan of Tina Fey, this book isn't going to change your opinion, butyou probably wouldn't be buying it anyway except to poop on it or something. But either way it's cool, because she'll still get royalties.

B000002U9Y|2.0|What do you do when the lead singer, main songwriter, and driving force of your band is no longer there?<br />You replace him and move on to mega-stardom.<br />Well sort of.  David Gilmour was brought in to cover for the increasingly erratic Syd Barrett's behavior and deteriorating live performances skills.  Syd just ended up in the gutter and getting tossed out of the band.  So Gilmour takes over Syd's guitar role and Bassist Roger waters and Keyboardist Richard Wright take up the songwriting duties.  The result is an album that is in a constant struggle of a band in the Shadow of a Syd Barrett and a band trying to find their own identities. Syd is still there on a few  of the songs,  with his song JugBand Blues and provides some guitar  Set the control's for the Heart of the Sun ( which Gilmour also provides guitar for making it the one time that Floyd was a 5 piece band)  Overall the album is a let down compared to their debut, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  The songs range from interesting to \\"yawn\\".  Syd Barrett's influence can be heard all over the album,  and the band struggles to find a voice and stay afloat.  Ok having said that,  there are a few song that I thinks are great,  the heaving Syd influenced Corporal Clegg and the far-out  Set the Controls....  The Richard Wright songs, though, are forgetable. I think the one track that the band tried hardest to put their stamp on and to stray as far away from Syd as they could is the title track.  A long meandering instrumental cut in section's with a chorale ending that show the Floyd are willing to experiment and put their necks out there a bit.  Does the piece work?  Not really but it's interesting and at the time very different from what their contemporaries were doing and was a beginning of what would define Pink Floyd for the next few year.  This is not a great album ,  but it definitely need to be in any fans collection and it's a sign of better things to come.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|Terrible!  Did not like this at all, I should have sent it back but for the price it wasn't worty it!  The wipes dried out, the case was hard to close and those stupid red dots never worked and fell out all the time!  Don't waste your money!
B000002UA0|4.0|This is not the cd I would recommend any new listener to Pink Floyd, well at least not right away.  This is Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd,  far from the extremely listenable weirdness of Dark Side of the Moon and even farther from the torment of  The Wall.  The Piper at the Gate's of Dawn is and will always be the seed that sprouted what we know now as Pink Floyd.  Syd  took his Seussical songwriting style and his pychodelia slide leads and created one the best debut albums of all those great British bands from the 60's.     Ok after saying all that,  though extremely innovated for its time.  The final output is at times mixed.  Songs like Astronomy Domine,  with it's crashing grunge-like guitars and spacey lyrics about (what else?)  space, Matida Mother, The Gnome, and Bike are songs that puts PF on it's on level,  apart from other contempary bands at the time , like The Beatle, The Kinks, and the Stones.  Lucifer Sam and Flaming are just great songs. But.... Pow R. Toc H  and the one Roger Water's penned  song Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk are just unlistenable to me now.  Interstellar Overdrive is about 7 minutes too long. Chapter 24 is  a bore and Scarecrow , well I don't know - it's a skip-able song.    Overall Syd's vision is definitely there and the band has been trying to live up to that ever since.  The strong songs well make up for the weaker numbers and Syd is obvious in peak form.    Would Syd have lead the band to multi-million stardom like they did without him???  Probably not, we'll never know.  All I know this album brims with promises of bigger and better things, though they are to come without Syd Barrett.
B002N1AERI|5.0|Okay, I can't actually tell you how brilliant this album is...  The words to describe the beauty of Simone Simons's voice, the power of the symphonic elements, and the fluidity with which the male voices come into the mix, escape me, but that is most probably because said words are yet to be created in the English language.  Suffice it to say that you MUST OWN this album!  There is growling, there is opera, there are guitars and there are violins...  But above all, there is passion and an unparalleled listening experience.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Michael Connelly hits another big one with this latest Lincoln Lawyer novel.<br /><br />Well written, well plotted and the story moves along. The trial scenes are especially good as the author takes you blow by blow through a murder trial with the prosecution and defense tactics.<br /><br />A good read although the ending was a bit predictable. I figured it out halfway through the book. A neat twist at the end with Mickey Haller's new direction in life. Are his days as a defense attorney numbered? At 400+ pages, the novel was a bit long and sluggish in places. Could have used some tightening and better editing. But overall a highly satisfactory read.
B000VZGK3K|5.0|A very aggressive, true story of the rise and fall of a famous billionaire aviator, movie producer, playboy, and businessman. Howard Hughes had a dream, and fought throughout his lifetime to fulfill his dream, after continuously being discouraged by society.<br />His childhood dream was to fly the fastest planes ever built, make the biggest movies ever, and to be the richest man in the world.<br />He suffered a life-time of obsessive compulsive disorder related to a germ-phobia, for which we found interesting.<br />The movie is not filled with very much action and excitement, as it is more on the conservative side, therefore may not be of interests to all viewers, but is however very interesting from beginning to end.<br />Interesting film in aspect of the early development of North American single-wing airplanes and jumbo jets, and an aggressive individuals desire to achieve his dream.<br />We cannot say we are a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but he did play a very descriptive role followed by an outstanding performance.<br />The movie does run 170 minutes, and keeps your interest throughout.<br />Era: Mid-1920's through 1940's.<br />We enjoyed the movie, and rate it a 6/10. Aviator is not a movie you may watch over and over again, but will be considered a nice addition to your home movie collection. We hope you enjoy it!!!

B003UXX0UG|5.0|I loved the hole seares of the Legend of the seeker. The thing I loved the most is the way each season would end with the quest of the season completed. so thet if the show was cancled it would not leave you hanging. The fact that the show was cancled was a darn right shame. It is so hard to find such a good adventure let a lone a fantasy one at that. I loved that the hero would get hert and bad. some shows make the hero go through to much and not get hert. No one is that good. the fact that he can be hert makes him seem that much more herroic. they left you open for a nother one but did not leave you in the middle of one. thanks to the makers. Any fantasy adventure lover would love this. and the fact that no more might not be made should not turn you off watching it or getting hucked on it. It will fill you. great acting. with sword fighting,sorcery, mystery, escapes, rescues, torcher, romance with forbiden lovers hoping to find a way and much more
0393072231|5.0|This is a great book. It helped me to understand what happened during the financial crisis. But it doesn't have an index!

B0047Y17P2|1.0|Just like the record companies years ago overpriced their CDs (which were then the cheapest media to produce to date), publishers now feel that they can get away with inflating the prices of e-books because of the growing popularity of e-readers.  It's even worse with e-books, where the publishers' overhead is next to nil to produce the product.  Greed.  Greed.  Greed.  Greed.
B004L49K20|5.0|When I found out that DD was putting out a new album I was so excited!! Even more exciting was that a full length album with additional tracks was going to be released in March. It seemed like it took forever for that day to get here. I ended up purchasing the Deluxe Edition so I could have the DVD footage, along with the 15th track \\"Networker Nation\\". I am glad that I did, since I really enjoyed the stories behind the making of this album and how each song came about. It is nice to see that after 30+ years, they still enjoy making music together. I also love that Mark Ronson got them back to their roots, while still allowing for a modern sound. I hope he continues to work with the band. He gets what the fans are looking for in a DD album. I will always rank their first 3 albums as my favorites, but this one is right up there with them. I find that I love it more with each listen. The only song that I really don't care for is \\"Safe\\". I don't hate the song, I just cannot get into it. \\"The Man Who Stole a Leopard\\" is just epic. Classic DD. I could have done without the news report at the end. It just goes on for too long. The two instrumental tracks are very beautiful, but I wish they were a little longer. I actually really like the title track. It has a great energy and really gets you moving. \\"Before The Rain\\" is a beautiful song and \\"Mediterranea\\" is a relaxing journey. I won't review every song, but each one brings something special to the album, and they work really well together. All in all, this is a must have for any DD fan. DD's songs just bring the listener to another place. I feel like they bring more depth to their music than a lot of other bands/artists. I cannot even stomach listening to what passes for music these days. I wish the radio stations would give DD more airplay and get their songs out there. They deserve it!!
630512065X|3.0|I loved Cats and still do which is why I bought this.  It is better than nothing and better than having just the music but the filming of the dancing is atrocious.  Anyone who has watched films of dancing knows you don't cut off in the middle of a routine and pan to someone else or someones face but that is what they did when they filmed this.  Don't buy it to see the dancing because it will just be frustrating.  Maybe they will make a better film of it someday.

B0041KKYEW|5.0|Darren Aronofsky never fails to provoke audiences. From his 1998 film debut, Pi, to his powerful sophomore feature, Requiem for a Dream, it was clear from the start that Aronofsky was a serious filmmaker, willing to take his audiences to places they would rather not go, in order to reveal a specific truth. To this day, his films are extremely cerebral and unflinching. While Black Swan is a change of pace for Aronofsky, it is no less brutal than any of his previous works.    Black Swan is a dark fairy tale and a psychological thriller, as well as a cautionary tale about the pursuit of artistic perfection. Natalie Portman steals the show as Nina Sairs, a young, ambitious dancer at a prestigious academy, who has just been chosen for the dual role of the White and Black Swan in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. While Nina's virginal innocence lends itself to the role of the White Swan, her instructor, the womanizing Leroy, insists that she will have to \\"lose herself\\" in order to accurately represent the openly sensual nature of the Black Swan. Suddenly, Nina begins to face corruption at every turn, coupled with what can only be described as a mental unraveling. The line between dreams and reality becomes horrifyingly blurred, as Nina tries to \\"find\\" her Black Swan.    From the very start of the film, you feel for Nina Sairs. Natalie Portman's portrayal is a perfect balance of naïveté and blossoming sexuality. Her transformation is heartbreaking and powerful, and by the time the credits roll, you will be speechless. This is Portman's best performance to date, for which she won an Oscar this year.    Black Swan is a film that will swallow you whole. If you are easily offended, you may want to look elsewhere.    Featuring amazing performances from all involved, including Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder, and Mila Kunis, as well as an incredible Barbara Hershey as Nina's unstable and controlling mother, this is a film that demands to be seen, and is Aronofsky's best film since The Fountain.    Black Swan is 108 minutes, and is rated R for strong sexual content, disturbing violent images, language, and some drug use. Released by Fox Searchlight Pictures. Directed by Darren Aronofsky.
031261246X|5.0|We don't continuously think about disasters, but we shocked when they happen. We all know the effects of earthquakes and tsunamis. They are horrible and can take thousands of lives. In his book Mark talks about completely different kind of disaster - a computer-related one, which can take lives as well. Being a computer professional Mark knows what he is talking about. In spite of the fact that this book belongs to the fiction category the plot is so real. And we all know that it can happen. Don't we? We know about the data loss on our home computers due to viruses, but for some reason we don't often think what can happen if virus hits vital services we use on a daily basis. If network is jammed it is bad, it causes us temporary inconvenience until it fixed by pros, which is not simple and easy by the way. But imagine what can happen if this is a targeted weaponized virus, which is designed to affect a specific industry or the whole country? Read about it in this well-written book. It will make you think and it will make you feel scary. Enjoy and learn.

B0047Y17P2|1.0|I understand that this is not Amazon's fault. The price is set by the publishers. Well, publisher, I have one thing to say, SHAME ON YOU! Finally, we have a method where people can read book instantly, environmentally friendly, and cheaply, yet you manage to screw everything up for all of us readers. Well, let me tell you this, I will never buy this book or any other book when the price does not justify the cost! SHAME SHAME SHAME!!!
B0032JTV6U|3.0|I love Glee and it is great to have the entire season as a set but most of the episodes skip and pause from time to time which is very upsetting and I see I am not the only one to experience this.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I just finished reading Child 44. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time, really good historical fiction/gritty mystery set in 1950's Russia. I really wasn't too interested in the subject matter but thought I'd give it a go because of recommendations, and I'm so glad I did. It's extremely well written and will have you missing sleep and meals so you can read it.
B002ZG981E|4.0|ES UN DVD QUE NO PUEDE FALTAR PARA LOS QUE AMAN LA CIENCIA FICCION, ESTA EDICION TRAE 3 DISCOS, UNA DE LA PELICULA BLU RAY, OTRO CON LA PELI EN DVD, Y UN TERCERO CON MUCHAS COSAS EXTRAS.    DEFINITIVAMENTE UNA BUENA ELECCIÓN.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|i have beaten the original angry birds and i thought i was satisfied.  ive played the holidays version, but i think rio is the best by far. thanks amazon!
B0047Y17P2|1.0|Thank you Greedy Publishers! I have saved TONS of money by not paying the ridiculous prices for what amounts to a skimpy file download.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|This version (April 2009) has the correct wide-screen aspect ratio. The more recent version released on blu-ray is for the older 4x3 ratio, in case anyone is wondering. Each episode does have the end-credits shown, but this is a minor annoyance. The color is much much better than the older DVD (1995). I will enjoy watching this over the years to come!
B002ZG99QS|1.0|I am a HUGE fan of Tron!  I remember when I first watched it as a kid and could not get over how amazing the film was, but this new addition is just plain shameful.  There was no plot hardly at all; the concept of Flynn being gone for nearly 20 years; okay possible, but come on, the best they could do was that a clone took over and Flynn, being the great `user' could not find a way out other than just doing nothing and spending his time becoming a \\"Zen\\" master; please!  Give me a break!  I expected so much more!  Not too mention that we don't find out whether or not Tron lives or dies at the end, only that he falls into the water and his suit changes color.  They don't even fully explain what it is all about with the Isomorphs and why they came into exsistence to begin with.  This movie is just crap and lame and any other word you might wish to use.  Don't waste your time on this.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|This program is the new X-Files, only better. With today's advances in technology the program is of much better quality. This team is wonderful together, Walter as the mad scientist is superb, you can't help feeling his pain and frustration of losing his son Peter, and why he took Walternet's son in replacement. Olivia is a very capable agent, and you really want Peter and Liv to get together. The agent assistant, Astrid is also an integral part of the team. I could go on adnausium as this show stopped our household. The whole family sat down to watch the next episode. We recorded each episode on the hard drive to rewatch so as not to miss anything! We are all very disappointed as the show has been taken off - in the middle of the season = not happy! Can't wait for the DVD to become available. Highly recommended if you like Sci-fi/drama/crime fiction.
1582701709|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It contains alot that edmost of us have already been taught through our religions, but with a new twist that shows how much power each of us really has.  It may be exaggerated, but it helps to get the point across.

B003YUC2FE|1.0|If I had only known...I should have read the reviews BEFORE buying. I love all 3 movies, no complaint there, and the toy box is really cute but putting the disks in foam is tacky. I'd rather have the cases. Oh, well...
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|I saw Tron Legacy 3 times in the theater in 3D. I've been eagerly awaiting the release on Bluray. The picture and sound are amazing.<br /><br />Disney did a great job on this release except for one area, the special features. About 30 minutes total talking about pre production, visuals and the cast. A Flynn lives segment, Daft Punk video, not much. A huge disappointment for me. You can not tell me their are not hours of set design and costume design behind the scenes stuff. You get to see tidbits of the design process in the 10 minute videos, but nothing extensive. I really wanted to see the body casting, design process, making of the suits, lighting challenges of the suits documentary, just a small hint was shown. Also, no directors commentary.<br /><br />One of the things that makes this movie work for is the Daft Punk soundtrack. It makes this movie sound amazing along with the top notch visuals. I personally feel their is plenty of story, plot. The digital Clu is much less CGI looking on the small screen.<br /><br />Movie 4.5<br />Audio and Video 5.0<br />Extras 2.0<br />Overall 4.0 for lack of better special features<br /><br />Final thoughts, great movie, amazing audio and video presentation, special features, just ok.<br /><br />Now that Tron and Tron Legacy are both on Bluray, I am a very happy Tron fan.
0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins<br /><br />I was lucky enough to snag this as a freebie for my Kindle from Amazon a few months back.  But, alas, it is no longer free on Amazon.  It is now $10.99 for the Kindle edition of the book!<br /><br />Anyway, let me tell you a little bit about the book.<br /><br />Anna is 17 years old and ready for her senior year of high school in Atlanta, Georgia.  She has a great best friend, a guy, and is pretty darn happy with her life.  Much to her dismay, her father decides that Anna needs more culture in her life and he insists on sending her to live in Paris to study for her last year of high school.  Anna has virtually no choice in the matter...<br /><br />Anna is unhappy.  She doesn't want to leave her best friend, Bridgette, behind or the new guy in her life, Toph.  But off to boarding school she goes, where she doesn't know anyone, and most of the students there have been classmates and friends for at least 3 years already.<br /><br />Anna is miserable, and crying in her room, her sobs get overheard by the girl in the room next door, Meredith.  Luckily, Meredith takes her under her wing and Anna finds herself with a group of friends:  Meredith, Rashmi, and Josh.  And then, then there's &Eacute;tienne.  &Eacute;tienne St. Clair.  The beautiful American boy with a gorgeous British accent.<br /><br />But, there's a problem:  St. Clair is taken.  He has been dating Ellie for a very long time, and though Anna won't admit to herself that she has a crush on him, he's off limits anyway.  Plus, it's pretty clear that Meredith has been crushing on him for a very long time anyway.  And, of course, there's Toph back at home, waiting for her return...<br /><br />Follow Anna as she learns to adapt to a new country with a foreign language, and becomes closer and closer with St. Clair.<br /><br />Will Anna love to learn Paris?  Will the city of romance, and the boy there, steal her heart?  Or will her life back home continue calling her as she anxiously awaits returning to see Bridgette and Toph again?  And when she returns home, will everyone there have changed?  Or is it Anna who will have made the changes?<br /><br />Read Anna and the French Kiss to find out!<br /><br />I want to start out by saying this is a great read for anyone who likes a clean romance.  I would give it a<br /><br />PG RATING<br /><br />But, only because there is a couple of words that are slightly more \\"adult\\" and because there are more adult themes in a couple of places, like drinking.  However, the interactions between the characters stick to kissing, and that is it.<br /><br />So, for someone who wants a squeaky clean romance, I recommend this book for you!<br /><br />This book quickly stole my heart.  Granted, I was fortunate enough to study abroad in Paris (but only for a summer) and the city stole my own heart.  So, anything and everything Paris makes me happy, and makes me smile.  This book definitely made me crave returning to Paris.<br /><br />I thought it was a great story showcasing the emotions of a young adult quite well.  The awkwardness of falling in love, but being unsure what to do.  The difficulty of being in a relationship that isn't working but not wanting to make any changes.  The reality of having a challenging relationship with your father.  It all felt really, really real.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss is a sweet book, and you cannot help but feel for Anna.  Who hasn't felt that lost when they went somewhere new, even if everyone there spoke your same language?  Who hasn't had a crush on someone only to find out they have a girlfriend?<br /><br />It's a great story about growth and change.  Life and love.<br /><br />5 stars!And when she returns home, will everyone there have changed?  Or is it Anna who will have made the changes?    Read Anna and the French Kiss to find out!

B004K4IZ54|5.0|This is without a doubt the best 3D experience I've seen so far on a home TV.  The 3D was flawless.  I never saw any ghosting.  If you want to see excellent 3D on your TV, get this movie.  In my case I have a 55\\" Samsung 8000 and was using a PS3 for the bluray player.    Actually I did see some ghosting -- on some of the 3D movie trailers that are on the disc!  It just proves that these other movies just aren't producing quality 3D movies like Disney did here with Tron: Legacy.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|My gripe is not with the movies, but with the disc. The first disc \\"Starship Troopers\\" would not load in my Sony bluray player after 10 minutes. ST2 and ST3 loaded within a minute. My bluray player has the latest firmware updates, and I have never experienced a disc not loading.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Good movie for young kids. I would recommend it for others to see. Thanks disney for a fine production.  Sorry for not writing this review on time.jaya 2.
B004G6009K|5.0|Since buying the set up for my 3D TV I have been starved for good movies to watch in 3D and this one delivered a spectacle of visual harmony. Coraline and A Christmas Carol were also beautifully done, but there are moments in Tangled I felt I was in the movie. I was scared when Rapunzel and I were in the cave filling up with water, to on the boat ride dazzled by how the floating lights danced over my head. Some people may say that 3d takes away from the movie experience, and that is true if it is bad 3d but Tangled delivered me an experience I could not get while watching it in 2D. 2D will still have the same great story and character triangles that make this a great movie, but it may not add that next level of emerging yourself in that story world.<br />I am 29 years old and never thought I would get reacquainted with Disney movies and enjoy them as I have with Tangled. If Disney continues to put forth more great movie in 3d like this then they will undoubtedly lead the DVD 3d sales when they sway more people into purchasing the proper equipment.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Great product!     My stroller just has a large storage basket underneath and I needed some form of storage that was within arms reach for little things. The Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy came to the rescue.  It holds my drink and any snacks I bring along for myself. You can't see from the picture but there's also a little zip mesh pocket inside which is great for storing parking tickets in shopping centres and keys (instead of fumbling around in my handbag). Price can't be beaten either! Thanks Amazon for a really useful product.
B004B32500|1.0|To each his/her own, I always say...but this--whatever you call it--was not my cup of tea, and for the life of me, I don't understand these glowing reviews.  The movie was so disjointed, so garbled, so incoherent, and (last but certainly not least) so LAUGHABLE, I had trouble following what was supposed to be a story.  Horribly acted (the mute girl both as a child and then as an adult were played by actresses who had the film presence of a turnip) this exercise in futility went on for what seemed to be days.  And if that wasn't bad enough, you have to watch really ugly, fat people be naked.  And there were a couple in there that should ALWAYS be fully clothed, even while bathing.  Something else that really bothered me was this movie was dubbed--and I DESPISE dubbed movies.  I certainly was never \\"moved to tears\\"--well, there was those shots of that naked fat man, but brother what a waste of time.  I was proud of myself for making it through this thing without turning it off.
0545123283|4.0|A great sequel to the amazing, \\"Shiver.\\" I found \\"Linger\\" to be very enjoyable and readable. The only problem I found was having a rough time adjusting to the 3rd and 4th new points of views. Mainly Cole. I think to have made a phenomenal sequel, Maggie should of stuck with Grace and Sam. I found myself skipping a few pages of Cole's point of view/ Isabel's point of view to get back to the reason why I love this series. Sam and Grace! I hope Forever focuses mainly on the most adorable couple in a YA series!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Great game, super fun, easy to play for just a couple minutes. Can get frustrating but just because you want to beat your high score! Recommended!
0802798225|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! After reading the synopsis I thought this novel was going to be something cheesy, but Simone Elkeles has written something as far away from the cheesiness as possible. This book is an enjoyable quick read, and after you turn the last page you wish you had more to read! It's one of those books where you bond with the characters so much, its hard to finish the book say goodbye. I recommend this book to EVERY gender of people. Male and Female. It includes Romantic and still Violent, Cursing & Explicit scenes that everyone can be sure to devour and be encased in this great addition of fine Young Adult literature!
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I think it works well on multiple levels. On the one hand, it's an excellent techno-thriller that I found fun to read and hard to put down. On the other hand, it's an accurate cautionary tale for those of us who either make their living from the Internet or just enjoy living on the Internet.    I think I found it particularly chilling that I agree with Mark's concerns that the vulnerabilities and attacks are all possible and, for those that haven't actually happened, very likely to happen.
0545123275|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed by this novel. Maggie does a phenomenal job of creating realistic characters and dialogue, while at the same time adding that paranormal kick. I would recommend this novel to anyone who wants to dip into a delicious and unforgettable read to escape for a few hours!
0316069353|5.0|Won't buy a kindle and get ripped off..waiting for the paperback and then I might wait some more and get it at a small used book shop! Support your locals and authors.  Buy the book.  Love Connelly and have read all of his others....i prefer Harry and the LAPD series but Matthew McConaughey provides eye candy.
1863962816|1.0|I am very disappointed with this book. There is a \\"wicked wizard's hat\\", a scary spider, \\"the ghostly galleon\\", \\"psycho-deliah\\" (a very ugly face), \\"castle of darkness\\", a ghost cake, a snake, an alien, \\"little cakes of horror\\", the number 7 is full of spiders and the six is the devil. Only sick people could think of cakes like this for children.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|This is a protest rating. The e-book is outrageously expensive. I am sorry for being unsympathetic for the poor, poor publishing companies who have to change their business model. Here's an idea: how about giving people and incentive to be green and not destroy forests! Equal or greater price for an e-book as compared to the hardcopy is just not going to fly.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Angry birds has sold out! Rio, really? And not to mention they use other companies technology and don't give credit or even recognize the people either. Don't get on the bandwagon. This game is not all that impressive.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This mini-series was excellent!  It followed historical facts so closely that I felt like I was living in that era.  I feel the characters were depicted truthfully, and realistically.  I home school my son, and plan on having him watch parts of this to give him a clearer picture of what life was like during those times.  I recommend this for anyone (younger children with supervision due to graphic scenes at times).
0316077054|4.0|This is the sequel to Beautiful Creatures and picks up Ethan's story the day after the events that occurred on Lena's birthday. While you can read this book without having read Beautiful Creatures, the story will make more sense if you have the background knowledge of the first book.      The story takes us back to Gatlin and finds Lena in despair over the death of her uncle on her sixteenth birthday. Ethan does not remember the events that happened that night or how Lena saved his life, so he does not understand her ambivalence toward him. While she loves him, she feels guilty that by saving him her uncle had to die. Her grief is driving a wedge between them and their relationship is very strained. In order to help Lena pull out of her grief and to find answers of his own about his mother's death, Ethan explores the Caster world under Gatlin and beyond. The book finally answers many questions I had in the first book. We find out what really happened to Ethan's mother, as well as what her connection to the Cater world was. We also find out what special powers Ethan has and how he relates to the Caster world around him. I was surprised more than once at relationships between the many characters in this book, and loved how the authors wove events from the past into what is happening in the present.    This is another epic novel at 512 pages, but once again it allowed the story to develop in a way that left me satisfied and the action kept my interest throughout the book. It is darker than the first book, with much of the book set in the underground and the continued battle between Light vs Dark. The sequel is every bit as good as the first in the series and left me wanting more. Fortunately it looks like we can expect two additional sequels, the next in the Fall of 2011. The authors have a website where you can find more information: Beautiful Creatures the Book.
0670022411|4.0|Eye of newt, tongue of toad, lizard tails.  Witches' brews seem to be made of anything handy.  So too does this book.  Take a pinch of Oxford and France, throw in a little Twilight saga, a cup of Harry Potter, some Dan Brown conspiracies and a story line with holes big enough to drive the ubiquitous Range Rovers through.  Don't forget alchemy, the Origins of the Species, and Albert Einstein.  Oh, and most obviously, add a dash of Syracuse, NY!!!  Apparently if Le Monde is not available, vampires will read the Syracuse Post Standard!  Alas, despite all this, I do love vampires--could be their dark, brooding good looks, wealth, knowledge and melodious names like Edward and Matthew.  So, though this book seems cobbled together with a little of everything, I really like it on a visceral and romantic level.  I guess I would say, definitely take a bite out of this book if witches, vampires and daemons are your thing.
B0043RT8JU|5.0|Quentin and Margo Roth Spiegelman grew up as next door neighbors. They were friends until the age of ten when Margo ditched him for the cool crowd. Over the next few years he watched her from afar, mesmerized by her antics. The story finds them on the cusp of high school graduation. Margo is the girl that every high school has, beautiful, popular figure who seems to have the world at her fingertips. One night she appears at his bedroom window, asking him to join her in a night of pranks to get even with those who have wronged her. This experience provides new hope to Quentin that their friendship can be renewed, but the next day Margo is gone, run away from home and her life. But she has left some clues for him, and as he unravels them he finds that he never really knew her at all.      His first fear is that she has committed suicide, a reasonable thought with what she was experiencing in her life at the time. He follows the clues, fearful that he will stumble on her dead body. Finally the clues lead Quentin and his geeky buddies on a hilarious across the country road trip. We watch his journey as he strives to find Margo, and in doing so he finds himself.      This book was beautifully written. The details used to describe moments found in real life created a masterpiece. The wonderful, quirky character development made even minor ones come to life and I could see them in the halls of my local high school. There were many moments when I laughed out loud while reading. The story stayed with me for days after I read it. On the surface it seemed to be a mystery to solve, but on reflection the true, deeper meaning of the book becomes evident. It was almost like I was so interested in him finding Margo that I almost missed the point of the exercise. While you may want to speed through this book along with the story, I suggest you slow down and savor each moment, novels like this don't come along everyday.
B00005JMAH|4.0|As you'll guess by my review title my feedback is not directed towards the movie - probably my favorite Harry Potter movie - but instead is intended as a warning to those ordering this version.  Look closely at the packaging before you open the cellophane - if you're like me you may receive a 'full-screen' (aka cropped on both sides) version of the movie rather than the wide-screen version pictured on the product page and described in the product detail.  I'm not sure about Amazon's policy with returned open DVDs but I returned mine unopened for what I'm told will be a full refund.    FYI my ordered was sold by 'Opti Shopper' (fulfilled by Amazon) and in addition to being full-screen it appeared to be marketed for sale in France - everything on the cover was in both English and French.    Didn't want to bring down the overall rating for this movie by giving this non-starter 1 star, so settled on 4.
0061726826|5.0|\\"It has been sixty-four years since the president and the Consortium identified love as a disease, and forty-three since the scientists perfected a cure. Everyone else in my family has had the procedure already. My older sister, Rachel, has been disease-free for nine years now. She's been safe from love for so long, she says she can't even remember its symptoms. I'm scheduled to have my procedure in exactly ninety-five days, on September 3rd. My birthday.\\"- Opening from DELIRIUM.      This novel is set in the future where the government has declared love a disease, known as deliria. In order to control the disease everyone gets \\"the cure\\" at age 18, basically a laser guided lobotomy to make you forget about feelings, fears and other things that may make you want to rebel against authority. Strictly enforced by regulators, everyone has to have the procedure and then live the life the government has planned for you, from your job to your spouse to the number of children you will have.    This is the world where Lena Haloway lives. She is weeks away from high school graduation and her 18th birthday, when she will be \\"cured\\". Her past harbors a dark secret: when Lena was eight years old her mother committed suicide because she was infected with love. Despite three attempts at a cure, none worked and she was left to suffer all the emotions associated with the disease. Lena's memories of her mother include laughter, gleeful dancing and her whispers of \\"I love you,\\" something unheard of in their world. As she prepares herself for the cure she begins to notice the world around her. She notices how calm and serene those who have been cured seem. In fact they are robotic people, void of emotion and who mindlessly follow what the government tells them to do. Then she meets Alex who introduces her to an underground world where people believe that love is not a disease and that the cure should be avoided at all cost. She learns how they live in the world beyond the restricted borders of her town.    Lena begins to question everything she has been told about the disease of love, especially when she begins to fall for Alex. We follow her awakening to the feelings of love and to her realization that her mother was not crazy, just a woman in love. We follow her journey as she learns more about her mother and tries to escape the mandated cure.    I found this to be a terrible premise that could happen in a society where people do not have the ability to question authority. It would be so easy for a government to control people who feel no joy, love or pain. And I think there are leaders in the world who would welcome having this type of control.    The book is beautifully written and a joy to read. It made me think about how emotions can alter your perception of the world and how different the world would be without love. Lena's journey and her discovery of love reminded me of those early feelings of love one discovers during the teen years. A sample of the wonderful prose is found when Lena realizes she is falling in love:    \\"I know what the problem is, of course. The disorientation, the distraction, the difficulty focusing - all Phase One signs of deliria. But I don't care. If pneumonia felt this good I'd stand out in the snow in winter with bare feet and no coat, or march into the hospital and kiss pneumonia patients.\\" (p.237).      The book stayed with me for days after I finished it, thinking about Lena's heartbreaking and painful journey to discover herself. In fact, the more I thought about it, the better the story became and I came to appreciate the deep inner meaning of the book. I was sorry to see the story end, but pleased to learn that there is a sequel in the works. I can't wait to find out what happens next for Lena.
B003P2WO5E|1.0|Let me get this out of the way right now.  I love the content of The Way of Kings.  Sanderson is an excellent author and he tells a convincing tale.  This review is not about the story.    This review is about typos.    E-book prices are climbing higher and higher.  I paid $12.99 for the kindle version of The Way of Kings.  I am 75% of the way through the book.  I have found hundreds of errors.  Some words are missing.  Others are misspelled.  Some words are repeated.  Some sentences look like they were written one way and then changed, but some of the wording from the original structure was accidentally left in.    Are these typos annoying?  YES.  Is the book hard to read?  Not really.  And if I had paid $6.99, I would not complain.  But for $12.99 I expect a finished product!    -David

B0041KKYBA|3.0|Inside Job adroitly uncovers cozy relationships that result in conflicts of interest leading up to the financial crisis and professionally presents graphic depictions to illuminate complex banking transactions.  Nonetheless, it largely miscasts the relative blame on deregulation as opposed to lack of supervision and oversight.  The documentary fails to adequately cover the governments intrusion into the capital markets as it continued to press Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to meet low- and middle-income housing mandates even after worthy borrowers were exhausted.<br />In addition, Inside Job does not recognize that well before the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999, the evolution of securitization and derivatives blurred the lines dividing the financial service industry. Aside from underwriting equities and corporate bonds, there were few things that large commercial banks did not do either within the bank or through its investment bank subsidiary.<br />Inside Job talks about the days when lending institutions funded mortgages on balance sheet w/ deposits or other balance sheet debt as if it were the 'good ole days.' We only need to look back to the thrift crisis to be reminded that retaining fixed-rate mortgages and funding them with short-term deposits was not a sustainable business model and an expensive lesson for the U.S. taxpayers. The S&L debacle taught us well that the models doesn't work.<br />Yet when Inside Job suggests that Wall St expense accounts were widely used to pay for prostitutes and drugs, it exposes its intentions and strains the incredulity of the informed audience. Like Warren Buffett's first lieutenant, who appears to have missed Berkshire's \\"Insider Trading Policies and Procedures\\" memo, an isolated case or two may be uncovered, but to somehow insinuate the practice was widespread is just false. In the aftermath of the early '90s Den of Thieves depiction, Wall St's compliance officers became keenly attuned to any suggestions of impropriety.  Inmy 20+ years on Wall St. (10 as a managing director) I never knew of any such cases. It appears that a high-priced brothel madam duped the script writers and producer into a free publicity stunt or it was intended to be a salacious addition to jump on the populist bandwagon.<br />Inside Job misses an opportunity to use its platform to capture the flaws in Wall Street's risk management and offer solutions that put in place a sturdier financial system.  In Lehman Brothers' Dance with Delusion, I offer solutions distinctly different from the conventional after-the-fact approach that the government currently uses to contain financial crises--a structure fashioned to withstand future financial crises at the costs of those responsible for taking the risk not the expense of the taxpayer.
0385737955|2.0|Thomas wakes up to find that he has arrived in a strange place called the Glade, a and he has no memory of his past life. The Glade is a dystopic self sufficient colony without adults in the middle of a maze with lots of boys and weird monsters. This is the setting for The Maze Runner. The kids in The Glade have tried for two years to find a way out of The Glade without success. Every day several boys run through the maze trying to find a way out, every night the walls in the maze move. The day after Thomas arrives a girl also arrives, an event because there had never been a girl in The Glade before. The book explores how Thomas reacts to his situation in The Glade, what his relationship with the new girl is, and if there is a way out of the maze.    I am a huge fan of dystopian fiction and I was really looking forward to The Maze Runner. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed. The characters in the book were not well developed and there was nothing to make me care about what happened to them. Even when they died, I felt nothing for them. The premise of the story sounded good, but after hearing about the maze that could not be solved over and over again, I didn't really care if they found a way out or not. What was meant to be an adventure with building tension was a boring story that I found difficult to get through. The use of words unique to The Glade didn't make any sense. I think that if an author uses unique words or languages, there should be a reason for it. As used the words made no sense and were distracting. Finally, the end was abrupt and obviously a set up for the sequel, but I think books should have some sort of a stopping point, not just a cut off that leaves the reader hanging. There was nothing here that made me want to seek out the next book in the trilogy.
B004MOMT2M|5.0|Canadian power trio Rush's ninth (and eighth studio overall) album entitled Moving Pictures was released in February of 1981 to fans whom were heavily anticipating a strong follow-up to the previous year's Permanent Waves, which was Rush's first Top 5 album here in the US thanks to songs like Freewill and The Spirit of Radio.<br />When fans first went to the stores to buy Moving Pictures (as my oldest sister did in 1981 and I would eventually on cassette in 1984 (then upgraded in 1988 and then CD in 1991 and then the 1997 remaster and now the CD/DVD and/or CD/Blu-Ray issue), the artwork must have caught some eyes. The title of the disc Moving Pictures had monumental multiple meanings. First, there is workers actually \\"moving pictures\\". Then, there are people crying because the pictures are so moving. Finally, there was a film crew making a moving picture of the whole scene on the back cover. Plus, actual moving pictures of the band at their respective instruments (on the original CD, drummer Neil Peart's photo was missing, luckily on the remastered issues, his photo was restored).<br />While Bob Ludwig originally mastered the album (and the 1997 remaster), the new remastering was by Andy VanDette at MAsterdisk (where Moving Pictures was mastered originally) and it sounds warm. Also, the new 5.1 mix by Richard Chycki is stellar. There are some things in the 5.1 mix not on neither the original LP mix nor stereo mix.<br />All of the songs on Moving Pictures were written by all three Rush members except * (with Pye Dubois) and + (by Geddy Lee/Peart).<br />The album starts at full throttle with \\"Tom Sawyer\\" *, which was talking about modern-day heroes and using one of Mark Twain's character as a metaphor and featured rapid playing by Peart, guitarist Alex Lifeson and bass player/singer/keyboard player Lee, whom was singing more and more in a lower octave on this album than previous albums. The song \\"Red Barchetta\\" follows, and is about a person who goes to his uncle's farm and discovers a car. The music picks you up then accelerates as the song goes on and then ends as it began by dropping you off at the next location. Next is \\"YYZ\\" +, an instrumental named after the luggage tag code at Toronto airport. That track was used as the focal point for Neil's drum solo in concert off and on for the next nine years after this track came out. The first half ends with \\"Limelight\\", which was more of Neil's song about his problems dealing with fame and was more sensitive than Alex or Geddy were in dealing with autograph hounds and stalkers and was a Top 100 hit in 1981.<br />The second half kicks off with the 11 minute epic \\"The Camera Eye\\", which was the last 10 plus minute suite Rush ever recorded and is a classic and is split in two parts. First, we're in modern day New York and then we go back to ancient times London and featured excellent guitar work by Alex and synth and bass work by Geddy. Next is \\"Witch Hunt\\", which was the third part of a four-part saga called Fear and is about dealing with prejudices and injustices in the world. Interesting fact, the mob rants at the start of the track was actually multi-tracked rants and raves of the three Rush members whom were acting hyper after drinking bottles of Scotch outside of the studio (Le Studio in Morin Heights, Quebec, Canada) and it was cold outside (below freezing) and the band were drinking and bellowing to create that rant effect. Plus, the song had Rush album cover guru Hugh Syme on synthesizers and two drum tracks by Neil to create a synth drum sound years ahead of its time. The album concludes with \\"Vital Signs\\", which would not have sounded out of place on a Police album and is a great track.<br />Moving Pictures was an instant smash peaking at #3 on the Billboard album charts and selling over 4 million copies in the US alone making it Rush's biggest seller to date here in the US for good reason. The songs, production and the playing are all top notch and Rush proved music soldon music and not looks.<br />Today, this album still sounds fresh and hasn't aged at all over 30 years on.<br />Now with the re-issue in honor of Moving Pictures' CD and DVD and Blu Ray, you will get to hear the album as nature intended on the remix. Also David Fricke's essay in the book is top notch and also the booklet is chock full of photos. This album belongs up there with classics like The Dark Side of the Moon, Who's Next, Hotel California, Back in Black, Appetite For Destruction, A Night at the Opera and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br />A classic!!!<br />RECOMMENDED!ooks.   Today, this album still sounds fresh and hasn't aged at all over 30 years on.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I an trying to connect on a rooted nook color. Says can't connect try again when you have 3g or wifi service. For those with the same issue my understanding is a rooted nook color with a stock rom is the cause of this issue. Hopefully, when the nook is upgraded to android 2.2 the issue will resolve itself. By the way the app works great on my htc evo

0316069353|1.0|I  buy one or two Kindle books each week and Connolly is one of my favorites, but not at these prices.   Someone really messed up on this price.   Readers should and must rebel with this type of price gouging.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This DVD shows all the very best technical, lighting & sound arrangements for one of the very best polished and accomplished long standing American bands.  The views & guitar rifts are way better than sitting  in the front row as the respective musicians are shown in close ups on each solo performance.  I first bought this  Eagles Farewell 1 Tour - Live From Melbourne DVD in 2006 and just recently bought 4 additional copies for gifts to very special friends and a \\"back up\\" copy for me.    Great performance and your toes will be taping and heart pounding all the way through the two DVD set.  I'm an avid Rolling Stones fan and have seen them in live concerts a total of 7 times with 1965 in Detroit Cobo Hall being the very first.  It's a first place tie between the Eagles & Stones for great entertainment.  Where ever the Stones or Eagles tour in the USA - I'll go to see them one more time!!!
B000006XSD|3.0|Alice's hard rock fans were probably very excited when `Lace and Whiskey' first hit the turntable and \\"It's Hot Tonight\\" blasted through their speakers. However I am also pretty sure that many would also be chagrined by the rest of the record as far as hard rock was concerned. Much like its predecessor, `Lace and Whiskey' contained many styles including disco, rockabilly, schmaltz and soft rock balladry (\\"You and Me\\" another Alice as Barry Manilow hit single) which proved to be ultimately unsatisfying but don't take my word for it as the LP stiffed in terms of sales. \\"Road Rats\\" also rocked fairly convincingly but outside of the opener and the latter tune, not much else made any forget the glory days of \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\".  Was the overall quality of the album tempered somewhat by Alice's by now legendary battle with the bottle? Perhaps, or was a case of the Coop being too \\"Hollywood\\" for his own good? The bottom line is that the record can be somewhat of a guilty pleasure but some of these songs are groan inducing and celebrity status aside, Alice was now on the downswing in terms of both his commercial if not creative successes. Damned if you do...
0811870413|5.0|This book is about baking an amazing loaf of bread at home.  There's a varying degree of criticism in the reviews, and I could add to it, but the proof of the pudding is in the tasting.  The first loaf I made was amazing even though I had such a gloppy mess of a dough I only baked it because I had a hot oven and a clay pot containing dough, so why not?  When I closed the oven door I was ready to toss the book, and when I took the loaf out I knew it was step one of an adventure.  I have been baking sourdough bread for years, so I already had a starter, but the rest of the process was almost completely different.  In fact this book is better described as a \\"process book\\" than a recipe book.    Knowing when each part of the process is complete is the key to getting it \\"just right\\", and getting it just right becomes an obsession, in spite of each loaf along the way being a winner.  There is a Facebook group, Recipes from Tartine Bread, that will provide both Group Therapy and good ideas.   Like several others have said, if you only end up making the basic country bread, the book is well worth it. The one thing you can count on is eliciting \\"You baked this at home?\\" comments every time.
0307454541|2.0|I bought this book for the sole reason that it had such amazing rankings in the Kindle store.  Seems that it's just one of those things where suckers like me keep the book's ranking up there for the very reason that it's already up there.  This book was OK, but if I could get back the time I spent on it, I'd read something else instead.  There are plenty of better mystery writers out there, so I'd recommend skipping this series and keep looking.  The characters aren't particularly believable, the story isn't very interesting and most of the book is spent researching with no action what so ever.  The two bad guys in the book are really not heard from (there is a confrontation with one but it only lasts a chapter or so, the other you never even meet) and the mystery wraps up without really much surprise and not much in the way of any sort of excitement for any of the characters involved.  If I devoted 40 years of my life searching for someone that was missing to the point where it was a total obsession and the mystery were solved, I'd think I'd have a bit more reaction than what was written about in the book... also I'd involve the cop more that was the original investigator.  At least let the guy KNOW the mystery was solved, he was obsessed with it as well and nobody even told the poor guy what happened!
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is one of my faves. More content than real radio has. It has Through the Bible episodes! It has comedy stations also. Get this app!
B004NSULHM|5.0|This band is incredible! I REALLY enjoy this type of Radiohead. I thought In Rainbows was fantastic and that recording seemed to be the nail in the coffin for many of their original fans but that's how it goes. Radiohead will always continue to chug along on their train of creativity and I'm on board for the long haul. Yorke has such a unique voice that is so infectious and the band is so experimental that I never get bored with any of their newer music. Many of these songs are quite haunting and beautiful. I have never heard another musician like Yorke who can effortlessly convey an emotion with their voice like he does. It's a real gift. My Fav song on this is Codex. The rhythmic piano perfectly accenting the high pitched crooning of Yorke makes for a simple addictive song. All of the songs on this album are great. If you liked In Rainbows your going to love this. If you jumped off the train after \\"Kid A\\" then you probably won't like it. As with most of their recent recordings this one has such a dynamic range that it is really only fully appreciated with a high end stereo. The bass is CRAZY clean on this recording.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!! Even though I'm only 13, I thought it was very well written, and also very interesting. It makes the reader want to keep reading, to keep trying to solve the mystery of 'A'. I read this book in one day, and I dont like reading that much. However, this book was the exception, i could read this book over and over again! I cannot wait to read the second book in this already fabulous series. May i re-state that I LOVE THIS BOOK?!?
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE This movie!! the book is amazing but the feelings you get through the movie is just awesome!! the love story is close to heart. Miley does an amazing job!!! Love Nicholas Sparks!!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|After recently seeing the new Jane Eyre movie with Mia Wasikowska, I was heartbroken and searching for a better Jane Eyre movie experience. After seeing this one, I understand the new one didn't have a chance. First of all, as someone who loves the book, I am convinced after seeing this that you can only do Jane Eyre justice in a mini series format- you need 4 hours to tell the story. The new 2011 version, at just over two hours, managed to cut out nearly everything I loved in the book, while also making Jane so gloomy and lifeless its impossible to believe she's in love.     Not here. Ruth Wilson is Jane Eyre even better than I imagined her, strong, self-possessed, confident, but also full of life and passion and all the joy you'd expect from an 18-year old in love. Why do so many movie versions focus on the horrible things that happened to Jane and portray her as damaged and fragile? Bronte's Eyre was anything but. This BBC production takes its time, and the romance builds slowly, but intensely, as it should.  Jane's girlish, teenage self comes through loud and clear- and that's a good thing.  There's a vulnerability and head-over-heels excitement behind all her stoicism and wittiness that she only shows in rare moments, mostly when she's alone.  There's good chemistry between the two leads, and all the passion that I found in the book.     Rochester is well cast.  He's just the right amount of handsome, I think. Dark and brooding. My only complaint is he can be a little too friendly. He reminded me so much of Hugh Grant, more rogue than misanthrope. I'll take it though. One of my favorite things in the book was Rochester's humor- he made me laugh out loud constantly with his irreverance and dry wit. Although the dialogue isn't verbatim from the book (which is a shame-why mess with perfection?) this Rochester is funny, clever, and dry, just as I imagined him.  I think he did a good job showing his guilt and grim resolve as he pursues his relationship with Jane, knowing the secret he is keeping.      I loved the scenes with Bertha. It was one of the ways this movie actually improves on the book. Because the novel is a first person narrative, we never see who Bertha was, how she drew Rochester in, or how she ultimately destroys Thornfield. This movie shows it, and I think it works perfectly.     I also think the movie did an excellent job showing softening aspects of the novel that seem dated and overly moralistic now,such as Rochester finding God at the end and being so humbled by what happens.  I like irreverant Rochester, and was sorry Bronte brought him down quite so far in the book. This movie shows the two of them keeping their senses of humor after they reunite.

1591843790|5.0|Maybe it's my personal situation that makes Guy Kawasaki's Enchanted so enchanting, or maybe it's all about the book. Regardless, Enchanted made me take action.<br />My situation may be like many people who will be drawn to this book: I'm looking to inspire and persuade people about ideas. I've just finished my own book (watch for The Plugged-In Manager this Fall) and am constantly working to find better ways to make the ideas sing across types of organizations and levels within organizations. The first thing Enchanted did for me was to help me create my personal position statement: Help people work with technology. That positioning statement is over twice as long as Guy's \\"Empower People,\\" but that's the hand I've been dealt.<br /><br />Guy defines enchantment as \\"the process of delighting people with a product, service, organization, or idea\\" where the \\"outcome of enchantment is voluntary and long-lasting support that is mutually beneficial\\" (p. xix) -- but I think there must be a bit of spell-casting in there somewhere. If you've seen Guy talk you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />My first action took place on p. 35. I was so compelled to save the positioning statement in Evernote that I violated the flight attendant's admonishment to turn off all electrical devices.The rest of the book is equally compelling. Guy tends to use a Top Ten approach in his talks, but I'll stick to a Top Two in this instance.<br /><br />One - he invites you take an active role in working with the ideas:<br /><br />He gives an Enchantment Hall of Fame on p. 41 -- but leaves space for you to add your own examples.<br />There is an excellent opportunity for a reality check on how you treat your employees on p. 156.<br />The conclusion is a self-check of the ideas of Enchantment.<br /><br />Two - he doesn't go it alone in building the story:<br /><br />He clearly identifies all the people who helped him in the process of writing the book, including an enchanting story about the cover.<br />He notes that to be enchanting you should build an ecosystem/community rather than thinking that you can go it alone.<br />Every chapter ends with a story of enchantment told by someone else.<br />Finally, and very importantly for an academic, he cites his sources and describes the underlying research with an even hand. Robert Cialdini's work on influence appropriately gets plenty of use and the only source I felt was missing is Everett Rogers' work on innovations.<br /><br />Should you go to one of Guy's talks? Yes.<br />Should you watch one of his talks as a video? Yes.<br />Should you read Enchantment? Absolutely.<br /><br />Over 60 reviews have noted that Enchanted is enchanting. We can't help ourselves. It is.<br /><br />I give thanks to Santa Clara University's Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship as they arranged for Guy to speak this week and surprised us by giving us all copies of the book. I also need to note that I've seen Guy speak several times and urge you to do so too. Sometimes I haven't been as engaged with the topic, but he is always inspiring in a value-added way. As you'll see in the book, he puts in his time and it shows. Thanks for that, Guy.unity rather than thinking that you can go it alone.

B003DZX44I|4.0|I am giving the blu ray however only 4 stars cuz the transfer was far too painted over the movie didn't resemble its original color  on the blu ray it seems that they made everything way too vibrant and surreal there doesn't seem to be much of the original artwork intact.  I was expecting the original movie with a clear crisp video and audio... not the movie redone and ridiculously vibrant and ruined...The movie is still amazing but its missing its original classical feel....
0552081256|5.0|This book makes you laugh, cry, feel sad, the whole range of emotions.  As you would expect from a WW II book, a great peek into how ridiculous wars are for the people fighting them.

B0047Y17P2|1.0|Love Connelly's work.  Will probably buy the paperback in a year or two.  We e-readers are getting screwed.  I own a Sony Daily and Kindle 2nd edition.  The prices for e-books are ratcheting up at the same time the big book sellers are filing for bankruptcy.  I read at least a book a week.  How crazy is the cost of a digital book download?  If the publishers and authors don't watch their greed, pretty soon some hacker will come up with the e-reader \\"Napster or Limewire\\"  then the publishers will be in the same boat as the music industry.  I haven't bought a c.d in years.....  The marketplace will rebel.  Lets not forget the up and coming youngsters aren't even reading anyway.  So don't hose your base reading fans.  I spent 27 years in the printing industry, which is gone the way of the buggy whip.
B000002U82|5.0|You must hear this album. Borrow it if you can, buy it if you can't. Steal it if you have to. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest albums ever made, and possibly one of the greatest works of art the human race has yet produced.
B001NSAJ3G|4.0|I must say, this album is got to be one of the most incredible studio albums that ever made not to mention the original mix.  I truly enjoyed listening to it as I always do now.  In case anyone be curious about the various mixes of this classic album and that anyone rated this album with one or two stars, please take note of this!  If anyone has the original (1967) album as well as the current one (1997 and 2007/2009 editions), please compare the two.    What I've learned recently from Wikipedia.org is that the original master tapes were severly damaged when they mixed this album for a reprint in 1978; they did all they could to restore the tapes and then copied them after the remastering.  What you heard in this CD (1997 edition) is in fact the 1978 remixed/remastered edition, not the 1967 original.  At that time when they released the reissued version of this album on record in 1978 before CDs came around, there were some alterations in the entire mix.  By the time the record company started to remaster the album for the CD edition in 1997, they used the 1978 remixed/remastered tapes; they still do that without some concideral thought of putting together all of the available resources concerning restoring the 1967 tapes to its original form in all the details.    No doubt that \\"Days Of Future Passed\\" is one of the most remarkable studio albums of all time, yet still the record company should need to think this over before they could release the remastered albums.  My suggestion would be is to buy the original record album (1967) and not the 1978 edition; that's a real treasure there!!    I'd bought the original record album in late 1999 from a flee market long before I bought the 1997 edition CD.  In the end, I favored the record album more than the CD.  However, the Deluxe Edition (2007) of this album has plenty of bonus recordings - a real must any Moody Blues fan out there.
B000002U8G|5.0|The question of exactly how good this album is could be debated endlessly. But it's a moot point, because you could throw away the entire first side of \\"Meddle\\" and still have 23 minutes of the most beautiful, unique, and uplifting music ever recorded.    I cannot explain \\"Echoes\\" to you. I have no desire to try, because any words I could use would be pale and ugly next to the beauty of this music. You will have to take my word for it.    Buy this album. Listen to side one if you want - \\"Fearless\\" at least is quite good. And then sit back in your chair, turn on \\"Echoes\\", and think of the noontime sun, shining over a distant sea.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|I'm not going to go in depth as many people already have.   All I'm going to say is that if your a Zombie movie fan,   and you have yet to see this, Buy it now. You will not  be disappointed. This is by far my favorite Zombie  movie of all time, and I enjoy just as much now as   the first time I watched it. It's got everything   you could want. zombie's, gore, humor, action,   horror, story, and plenty more. It's nice   to see it in Hd as well.      There are a bunch a special features including  commentary, behind the scenes, the making of, and  more.     Like I said earlier. Buy this movie now, and  you won't be disappointed.
B004J4WQ46|5.0|It's not five stars, but it's not one either. So, I rated it five to off set the people who dislike a great album. It's not their best, but it's up there. You know what you are going to get with this band, but it doesn't mean it's not excellent. Their solid musicians who make a record every few years. Their not changing the world, but that's okay. Sit back and enjoy the show.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|The Resident Evil movie franchise get's a lot of crap critically, and I never really understood why. To me the point of watching a movie is entertainment, and fun. That's exactly what this movie gave me. Sure the plot isn't that deep, but I don't think this or any of the other Resident Evil movies really need some big, epic plot. It's simple. Zombie's have overtaken the world, and outnumber the humans. Survive, and try to keep the human race alive. That's your plot, and that's all you really need.     This movie has just about everything you could ask for in a zombie movie, and more. Zombie's, action, good looking girls, blood, and some pretty awesome fight scenes. I originally saw this in theaters in 3d, and really enjoyed it. When I saw it released on blu-ray I questioned if I enjoyed it more, because of the 3d. After watching it even without the 3d I enjoyed it just as much. I'm sure the 3d blu-ray would make it even more fun.    The movie comes with a bunch of special features including commentary, behind the scenes, outtakes, and more.    If your debating watching this, my advice would be to go into it open minded, and without expectation. If you enjoy action I think you'll be more than satisfied.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|Not really five stars, but I'm trying to off set the people who gave it under three stars which I feel is unjust. Over all a very solid album. I still miss the old days of Automatic for the people(although some people wouldn't call those the old days). But, to me they are. I'm happy I got to see R.E.M. back in 1995 at MSG in NYC with the orginal lineup! As time passes it becomes more and more special. Time is a funny thing you can't control. Enjoy the album people. Stop reading this and listen to it already.
B003097ABA|5.0|I bought all of The Cars albums when they came out. They've been in the garage for many years now and I just can't get rid of them, due to the joy of their sound at the time. I bought this because the price is great for replacing my albums plus nice to have the original art work. Re: Move Like This, out very soon - I missed the intro on my stereo in the car and when I heard it, I got mad, thinking a band had totally ripped off The Cars! I was extremely happy to hear it IS them...again! I'll be one of the first to get it.
B001IF252M|5.0|First of all, it does its job perfectly and flawlessly.    And it's beautiful.    I was considering 3rd party well-known products, but ended up with this Apple product cause I wanted to use this for a long time. (durability and warranty)    It's nicely working with my 2011 Macbook Pro and now I'm watching movies with my Epson projector connecting my MBP with this cable.
B002WYJHBA|5.0|So great to have this film on Bluray.  Ggreat transition from BW to color.  And ... a wonderful message to boot!<br /><br />  Exceptional dealer as well.
B001JAFYFG|5.0|Some brief observations:    The picture quality is much sharper than the DVD.  The surround sound comes ALIVE!   The audio and music fidelity is stunning - the electronic music is piercing as designed.  Scenes in The Love Shop seemed to have all the haze and smoke removed for a far more 'revealing' experience (don't know if this was the directors intention as this was rated PG)    I know some of the acting is poor, there are plot holes, slow moments, even some silly ideas, but I loved this as a teenager and I still do. It's got cool visuals, great action, and some deep emotions and ideas. It's fascinating to see older movies when the only SP/FX were with matt paintings, real pyrotechnics, and intricate miniature models.   Cool
B004UNB1R4|3.0|Good, but not great, new album from Robbie.  Musically and lyrically it is pretty much in line with \\"Robbie Robertson\\" and \\"Storyville\\", but there's not much new here and nothing that really stands out like Night Parade, Shake This Town, or Somewhere Down the Crazy River from those first two, and definitely nothing like some of the more experimental stuff on \\"Contact from the Underworld of Redboy\\".    Great guitar slinging from Clapton and Robert Randolph, but I would have preferred stronger material to start from.
0316069353|1.0|Why should the Kindle price be more than a hardcover book price.  Fix this please or just junk the kindle.  No use for it if we have to pay more.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I never post reviews on Amazon, but I gladly shelled out $14.99 for the Kindle version of the book.  Why?  Because Michael Connelly is my favorite author, and I'm paying for the content that is so enjoyable for me and I know I'll get my money's worth .  Do I think the publishers are being greedy charging more for eBooks then their Hardcover counterparts?  Sure, but it's not a reason to damage the rating of a book, as it has nothing to do with the actual content we are paying for.    There are other forums to express dissatisfaction with the pricing of the kindle books.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I'm sorry, I hate giving a book a 1 star review because of price, but since there is no where else to complain, I'm gonna do it here.  The e-book version is $14.41 more than buying the physical books.  I just won't buy these books until the publisher pricing is more reasonable.
B004L49K20|5.0|Thank you, Mark Ronson, for letting the lads know that it's OK to sound like themselves again. It seemed at times like DD were going to great lengths to NOT sound like the music that made them the biggest band on the planet in the 80's. This latest set puts many things to right in that regard, because like most people have said, it sounds both retro and 21st century Duran all at the same time. And again, thanks to Mr. Ronson for dragging this album out of them.  And since it's 30 years since the release of their first record, Planet Earth, I must say that to my utter shock and surprise, Duran Duran have actually released the right album at the absolutely right time for it! This is something long-time Duran fans are not accustomed to lately.  What I enjoy the most about the record is that there are fewer slow songs, and more of the mid-to-up-tempo songs that I prefer. But when they do kick it down a notch, the results are stunning (\\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard\\"). Standout tracks besides the title track, are \\"Blame The Machines,\\" \\"Being Followed,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Runway Runaway,\\" which sounds a bit like a cross between \\"Lonely In Your Nightmare\\" and \\"Rio.\\"  Ultimately their message is clear: All You Need Is Now! Makes perfect sense to me.  Thanks guys, we knew you had this one in you!
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I am not willing to pay more for a digital edition than for the hard cover edition, no matter how many excuses the publishers throw at us. The publishers need to start adjusting to the digital world as software publishers have.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|The first song I ever heard by Florence +the Machine was their song \\"Heavy\\".<br />From that moment on, I knew I'd be a fan. Her voice is haunting in a way that leaves the songs stuck in your head, not in the annoying elevator music way, but in a way that makes you want to listen to a song again and again, until you know every word. The lyrics are so easy to relate to, whether you're falling in love or falling out of it. She'll inspire you, encourage you, and, above all else, restore your faith in today's music scene.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|A very good follow-up to 1982's groundbreaking \\"TRON\\". The visuals are fantastic. The actors all do a fine job, especially Jeff Bridges in the dual role as Clu/ Flynn. This well done sci-fi. Very entertaining.
0439023521|4.0|Collins starts the series off right, introducing readers to a series filled with gruesome, detailed adventure, loss, heartbreak, and ultimate heroism, with just the right amount of a suspenseful romance. Katniss is a heroin that you'll cheer for and ache for, both for her true dauntless nature and endurance. The characters in the novel are true and vulnerable, making the sudden loss of some of them something the readers don't see coming, and mourn for. The novel is laced with action that appeals to readers of any age and gender and is filled with details that sometimes make your skin crawl (in a great way).<br />Warning: the series is addictive and a quick read, something you'll miss once you finish the third book.<br />I look forward to seeing what COllins has up her sleeve next! I'm excited about a female author who isn't afraid of adding a little gore to her novels!
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I am so happy to see the majority of reviewers showing their distaste for the $14.99 premium price of this ebook!  I wanted to give the book zero stars because I can't even start to read it until the first hurdle is cleared: price.<br /><br />I don't blame Amazon.  Apple started this crap back in Jan 2010 when they met with MacMillan and implemented the agency model whereby the publisher sets the selling price and then other publishers followed.<br /><br />I hope the overall rating of this book sinks home with the publisher, Hachette Book Group, and they lower the price NOW.  When this happens then I will buy, read, and review it based on the other factors that make up a book review.<br /><br />****<br /><br />Finished reading THE FIFTH WITNESS now that the pricing debacle is resolved.  Michael Connelly is one of the best writers in the industry.  His word flow is effortless for me while reading one of his books: less is more.  The plot was good but the book contained too much courtroom action for me.  I know Mickey is a lawyer but I don't ever recall one of MC's books being so heavy on the legal.  I liked the title as it related to the book but the end was a bit predictable as it wrapped up.<br /><br />I hope that the publisher does not try to release his next book, THE DROP, for $15 as was done with this one.  Price remains the first hurdle for me.  I do not want to rate another MC book at 1 star so hopefully they learned from this one.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Fun, entertaining and worth the ticket price. A good storyline, witty remarks from Depp, and a beautiful setting. Reminds me of a classic black and white with modern updates, in both content and pace. I enjoyed it very much.
0316069353|1.0|ok, maybe I am missing something, but I can't even find the kindle version on kindle store, only saw the audio book version.  So, although I agree with the one star reviews, it's kind of funny to complain the kindle's book price when the book doesn't even have a kindle version.      Well, maybe they are complaining the Epub version, but then it doesn't have anything to do with Amazon.  As a kindle owner myself, I surely hope they could lower the price to 10 dollars or below, but I don't think the publisher will listen.  Don't blame Amazon or publishers for the price, go blame Apple for signing the deal with the publishers to increase the ebook price, Apple is the culprit here.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I saw a review for this DVD somewhere else and decided I would try it. This is the best workout I've ever done in my life. I immediately felt the difference. What I love most is all she needs in 20 minutes of your day..Just 20..and it motivated me to want to do it more. You think about how little time of your day that is, and it makes you not mind doing it. My girlfriends and I get together 5 times a week and do it together. Jillian motivates you to want to push harder and harder and I love it. I would recommend this workout DVD to anyone. In shape or not, you will not regret it!!
1416955070|4.0|This is a series which has been figuring on just about every list for twilight fans, and on top of that recommended by Stephenie Meyers, and so it felt like it was just a matter of time before it ended up in my hands. Finally, it did, and I was able to find out if it was as good as everyone said it was. Well...was it?<br /><br />Absolutely!!! Every bit as good!!<br /><br />However, to tell you the truth I wasn't totally converted at the beginning. Two reasons for this:<br /><br />1) Many bits and pieces have been borrowed from other fantasy work, and at the beginning all I could think of was where these bits and pieces came from (that Hodge resembled Dumbledore in Harry Potter etc).<br /><br />2) There is also a lot of world building going on, with so much background info weaved into the story that at times I got detracted from the plot.<br /><br />Hence, it took quite a few chapters before I started to get used to the world of shadowhunters and demons that Clare has created. Once I got into it though, I got into it deep, and before I knew it, I raced through the pages in no time at all. So regardless of my hesitations at first, this is extremely addictive stuff! It truly is.<br /><br />As for the plot, Clary is an ordinary New York girl, or so she thinks. She lives with her artist mother and has one best friend - the geeky Simon. All is well until the day the two of them head out to the notorious goth club Pandemonium, where Clary witnesses something very strange.<br /><br />She doesn't know it then, but what she does see is three shadowhunters capturing and destroying a demon. You see, in this world, all types of nightly creatures exist, demons being the most dangerous. Normal people are of course oblivious to all of this, and the shadowhunters, whose work is to keep the world somewhat demon-free, like to keep it this way.<br /><br />What is odd is that Clary sees them, despite the glamour the shadowhunters use in order to avoid being detected by normal people. But the odd things have only just begun. Not long after, Clary's mom is kidnapped and Clary herself is attacked by a demon, and brought to the shadowhunter's home (an old cathedral which has been made into their New York Institute).<br /><br />The shadowhunters are Alec and Isabelle who are siblings, and Jace -  their adopted brother. The new arrival of Clary stir things up a bit within the small and tight shadowhunter group, in particular Alec and Isabelle who both have their reasons to stay wary of Clary. Jace however feels inexplicably drawn to Clary right from the start and they end up spending quite a bit of time together, at the institute or during various dangerous missions.<br /><br />I loved watching their budding romance enfold, but mostly I loved Jace. He jumped out of the pages right from the start. It's been some time (if ever) since I read about such a fascinating, complex and sexy character! The moment he got more page time with Clary in The City of Bones, I was a convert.<br /><br />So yes, there is no denying it that the number one reason why I loved this first installment was Jace. Yet, there is so much more to this novel. The well-rounded characters (Simon, Luke, Magnus, Alec, Isabelle), the non-stop action and last but not least the quirky dialogue.<br /><br />See a snippet below:<br /><br />\\"Have you fallen in love with the wrong person yet?'<br />Jace said, \\"Unfortunately, Lady of the Haven, my one true love remains myself.\\"<br />...\\"At least,\\" she said, \\"you don't have to worry about rejection, Jace Wayland.\\"<br />\\"Not necessarily. I turn myself down occasionally, just to keep it interesting.\\"<br /><br />The book is filled with this kind of sarcastic dialogue - mostly from Jace, but Magnus Bane and Simon will occasionally pitch in as well to create some really funny moments.<br /><br />There is really only one minor disappointment with this book and that is the unexpected twist at the end, which I can assure you will be quite frustrating. But Iurge you to keep reading, because it only gets better. Having read all three books, it now stands as one of my all time favorite young adult series (along with Twilight of course.)<br /><br />Grade 4.5/5ng adult series (along with Twilight of course.)    Grade 4.5/5
0061914177|4.0|If you are thinking of using social media as a tool to attract more business, several of the chapters in this book will be highly relevant to you.      Here is the cliff note guide I sent to my team:    Gary Vaynerchuk is occasionally irritating and obnoxious, but I have to give him credit - I got a lot of great ideas from this short, fast-reading book.  This book helps you understand why social media is an important cornerstone to building your business, and gives a lot of specific ideas of how to incorporate SM into your day-to-day biz activities.  The best idea I took from this is it how to out-reach to your target community to get engagement.  Brilliant.  If you want to attract new clients with interest and SM marketing), this will be highly relevant.  * Chapter 1 - skip  * Chapter 2 - only read page 24 (storytelling); skip the rest of this chapter  * Chapter 3 - skim  * Chapter 4 - skip  * Chapter 5 - create great content - read.  Page 51 is a great Realtor blueprint.  * Chapter 6 - read carefully.  Page 67 is the core philosophy that makes this work in an authentic way.  I really liked the Twitter ideas on page 68-75.  It's worth getting the book for this alone.    * Chapter 7 - skip  * Chapter 8 - important for person newer to internet marketing and essential for experienced marketers.  Read it twice.  This is the critical part of the overall approach I've missed until now.  Seems obvious in hindsight, but I wasn't smart enough to figure it out until I read it here.  * Chapter 9 - pretty short  * Chapter 10 - read.

0689865384|4.0|Uglies is the first book in the Uglies Trilogy. At first, when I started reading it, I thought it was just  a light and fun read; a page turner yet not something I'd lose sleep over, a 3 out of 5. But as I read more, I found myself getting more and more invested in the characters. By the time it finished (and it finishes with a cliff hanger) I literally threw myself at the next book Pretties, thankful I had already acquired it. So it does get better!<br /><br />The book starts with the young heroine, 15-year old Tally, who is an \\"ugly\\". She has been left alone in \\"Ugly town\\" since her slightly older best friend Peris, has moved to the \\"Pretty town\\" (for his 16th birthday) to have his operation. In this dystopian future, Tally lives in a society in which everyone has major surgery on their 16th birthday, to become supermodel gorgeous. Before the operation, as a normal person, you are thought of as ugly, and thus every teenager longs for the day of the operation.  So does Tally.<br /><br />Things change though when Tally cross paths with Shay, a girl who has opinions on the society in which they live, not completely accepting it. When Shay runs away just before her 16th birthday to escape the operation, the authorities force Tally to choose between staying ugly for life or to find and bring back her friend.<br /><br />Tally decides to go after Shay, and well, that is essentially where the adventure begins. I won't say too much, as there are so many surprising twists and turns in this book, it is best knowing as little as possible.<br /><br />There were a couple of things that I really liked about the book. Firstly, the plot of the story makes you think about the way things are in our society. Not only about our obsession with beauty and what price is worth paying for it,  but it also makes you reflect on the environmental issues of our world. In the book, our society is constantly referred to, as the utterly stupid society who lived in such an unsustainable way that it nearly extinguished the world. This truly makes you think about how we live our life. One example is when someone tries to explain to Tally what \\"newspapers\\" used to be in our society; essentially books printed for a one-day-use to be thrown away the day after. All those trees wasted for a one day read. How utterly stupid and wasteful, Tally reflects. And I can't but agree.<br /><br />I also liked how Tally, the main character grows throughout the book, as in the rest of the series. She starts off as a quite immature girl, completely unaware of the effect her society has had on her, but gradually becomes stronger and also more likable.<br /><br />There is romance, but it's not the focus of the story. Actually, that happened very quickly, I did not even see it coming (and I'm usually good at spotting those things). Consequently, it's not something to swoon for, and never really made my heart racing. Still, it's kind of nice that it's happening. It sort of adds to the story rather than makes the story if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Finally what I liked about this book is how you gradually get to know more and more about the society they live in, as Westerfeld reveals secrets throughout the book. He keeps you on the edge, revealing bits and pieces here and there, but always leaving things out, so that you are wishing for more, and keep turning pages.<br /><br />Uglies does not feel like a stand-alone book, and as I mentioned before, you will most likely want to keep reading the next two when it is finished. It kind of draws you in gradually. Starting light and easy and then before you know it you will be hooked. If you like books like The Host and Hunger games, I'm pretty sure you will like this series as well.This truly makes you think about how we live our life.

B001992NW4|5.0|Most classic horror movies don't stand the test of time very well, but this one does.  And then some.    This outstanding Blue-ray edition has two disks: the 1973 classic and the 2000 director's cut.  The director's cut disk also has a three part documentary about the actual filming of the movie, the neighborhood that it's set in, and the movie's ongoing legacy.  As with most \\"special features\\" segments, die hard fans of The Exorcist will get much more out of it.  You will see how director William Freidkin set up the shots, moved the camera, motivated his cast, etc.  I found it to be fascinating, and if you love this movie like I do, you'll eat it up.  As for the actual movie, it remains a geniunely chilling experience to this day.  I was not yet born when this movie was released, but the profanity and imagery was unheard of at the time.  The evil spirit (possibly Satan himself), chooses what on the surface seems to be the sweetest and most innocent little girl in the world.  Her progression from that little girl into the monster that she becomes is one of the most chilling stories in the history of movies.  The famous images of the spinning head, the crucifixion stabbing, etc, will stay with you for a very long time.  Possibly forever.  The casting and directing are absolutely perfect, and with different actors, this movie would probably not be the classic that it is.    Buy this Blue-ray double disk, turn out the lights, make popcorn (but avoid split pea soup), and be prepared to be scared out of your mind.
B001SN78JO|4.0|This is one of Jim Carry's better comedies.  Funny throughout.  Solid entertainment.  It even has a good, albeit simple, philosophical point (saying yes to everything is sheer stupid), which is a nice bonus.  I enjoyed this more than I expected to.  Recommended.
B004MOMT2M|3.0|On all but \\"Vital Signs\\" Geddy's voice appears in the right channel and center channel. Not hardly a true 5.1 mix. But I have never been impressed with any of the 5.1 mixes on their concert DVD's (sorry Alex) either. As far as \\"Vital Signs\\" being \\"unreleased\\", that is not true. I have an old VHS video from the '80's called \\"Through the Camera's Eye\\" that has the \\"Vital Signs\\" video on it. I'm a big Rush fan but have been increasingly disappointed with the repackaging of their older material. How many greatest hits packages do we need? Save your money and wait for the new album. If it is as great as \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" it will be worth the wait!

The movie had potential, and it the first 15 minutes are pretty good, from then on, everyone else just sinks the ship.

1594202842|4.0|If anyone should HATE this book, it's moi.  I authored a far-western antithesis on home schooling my daughter for intellectual freedom and enjoyment of learning (HOMESCHOOLING ABBEY).  Why the four stars?  For one thing, we're talking about a writer here, and she kept me turning page after page to see what would come next.  With sentences as tight and wound up as she is, she had me feeling like part of that family.  I miss Sophia, Lulu, Amy and Jed.  I flinched at times when she went after Lulu, but I cringed royally when Lulu went after her at the climax.  I was on Chua's side at that moment, bracing up for that gut-wrenching familiar clang of American teenagers telling their parents to bite off and chew.  Would I want to do things Chua's way?  Impossible:  But I don't think that's the point.<br /><br />I think those in the one-star arena are missing an important point.  Any parent these days who has something to share with us should not be devoured--especially when she's got some credentials and is writing well.  Schools have alliances; the government has alliances; parents don't.  It's so easy for the elephants to blame it all on the mice.  Then the mice start devouring each other.<br /><br />Parents are frazzled.  We're guilted 24/7.  We claw for parenting books because we sense the horror:  Our families are being bled to death by monolithic empires over which we have little power:  nationalized schools, huge franchises, big government, mega marketing.  The tiger doesn't need to be devoured by the lions for treading with the elephant stampedes and living to tell about it.<br /><br />Surely the author would lapse into proud rah-rah-us moments, and she's not a creative writer.  But her tone is generally humble yet spirited, determined yet vulnerable. She's willing to be laughed at, to share her mistakes with parents--most of whom are living in exhausted seclusion.<br /><br />I think the essential flaw causing the raucous is that Chua did not allow this idea to grow to fruition.  She wasn't sure what she was trying to say, hadn't gotten an overview of her role as mother yet.  Was she in favor of tiger mothering?  Had she been turned against it?  We're left unsure whether we're reading a how-to, a how-not-to, or a memoir, but I was both intrigued by and grateful for an honest look into an American family who might have some things to share.<br /><br />We parents have little time to cultivate deep friendships.  But I definitely feel I've spent quality time with Amy Chua, maybe the first mother in weeks.  Any parent hungry for a visit with an honest mom, trying her best in a system where parents of teenagers are rendered almost powerless, will find this family's life worthy of their affection--hopefully moreso than their judgment.sure what she was trying to say, hadn't gotten an overview of her role as mother yet.

B004R96SPQ|4.0|Confessions of a Book-a-holic<br />[...]<br /><br />This book was a good quick read. The whole time you're wondering is she going to survive. I was thinking the whole time, that so much life was waiting for her, her other family, her friends her boyfriend whom she loved--of course she should want to live. She would want to live so she could  live out her dream for the people whom she lost durr...but apparently her mind was going all over the place--so was Gayle. Although backstory is really great, when I got really into the present, she throws in a random story--I don't even really care about, and totally interrupts whats going on in the now. This frustrated me to a point, I really didn't even give a damn about it. I was like, just tell me does she decided to stay! I think the author really should have edited that out, and tried her best to put more effort into the present, or more relevant back stories. Other than that mishap, the book was great. In the end you're kind of left deciding for yourself. Which I don't like to do, I just want to know, but lucky for us Hollywood has got it's hands on this book and it's going to become movie...oh and there is a second book.<br /><br />The book has been rereleased, with a sticker that says if you like twilight you will like this book. It also has a darker picture than the one above, in paperback form. Don't get discouraged, this book and Twilight way different--this is written much better. No Vampires, no fork in the roads, no pining girl who cries about how much she loves this one person over and over, this is a real novel and will appeal to people who liked Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold or Breathing (which I just finished) by Cheryl Renee Herbsman.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|Hollywood becomes darker and stranger each year. Those who run the major studios often pump out so much horror, sick violence, vulgarity, and psychological deformity that one must wonder about how all this is screwing up the viewers.      Natalie Portman delivers her all, and for that matter the acting by everyone is far above average. I just wish that the flicks the Hollywood elite love to create and honor were actually honorable. This film is going to appeal to women from 14 to 30 primarily. The chronicling of a mental breakdown of a talented, hopeful, and impressionable ballerina is not good fodder for the viewer's mind or soul.      Having virtually all the characters around ballerina Nina almost conspire to ruin her psyche, health, and morality is depressing. The psychological instability that results in this neurotic adventure left me depressed. Adding in images of masturbation and lesbianism for the heroine is also inappropriate for our society as a whole, and young people in particular. Hollywood is obsessed with promoting violence, creating new ways to frighten viewers, and promoting homosexuality. I know a lot of people are getting sick of their not so subtle propaganda.     What a great waste of talent and time for all who were involved in this. In a declining economy and society with worries growing weekly, we don't need this type of negative reinforcement. Movie goers need to boycott the intended disturbing & terror images and stories. Instead paying to see uplifting and spiritually positive flicks is the only way to return Hollywood to it's former glory. I have read about how the weasels who control this place make it very difficult for film-makers to get such films to the public. Cutting off their money is the only thing they will ever understand.

014241543X|5.0|Gayle Forman's writing hooked me from the 1st page. Being sucked into If I Stay took me by surprise, as I'm not a huge fan of contemporary books, but Gayle's writing is addicting and I couldn't seem to get enough of Mia's story.<br /><br />Mia herself is a character of strength. Having been in a horrific crash that will forever alter who she is and her family, Mia clings to the memories she has shared with those she loves, her parents, little brother Teddy, her boy friends Adam, her best friend Kim and her grandparents. These are characters I really enjoyed getting to know, and they've all had a huge impact in Mia's life and molded her into the person she is. Gayle introduces them in a unique way which for the most part is through Mia's memories as she's contemplating on whether she should stay or let go. It wasn't hard to sympathize with Mia's struggle, as she sees her grandparents, other family members, her boyfriend and best friend all gathered around her, but yearns for her parents and little brother.<br /><br />I love all the elements and emotions that Gayle threw at me. I loved that not only is the story heart breaking, riveting and one that made me think, but it's one about hope, survival and love. There's two very moving scenes that really show the essence of love and that's with her Grandfather and with Adam. I'll admit, I was in tears reading them as Gayle's words painted a vivid picture of what these characters where feeling. They were all essential in helping Mia decide what she's going to do, as either choice she makes will be heartbreaking.<br /><br />Gayle's natural talent for writing allowed her story to flow effortlessly between the past and the here an now. If I Stay has a writing style that captured my attention, altered my thought process and introduced me to characters that have left an impression on me. I am really looking forward to reading Where She Went. I recommend picking this book up. If you're not a fan of the f-bomb, know that it's mentioned a few times in the story.<br /><br />You can also read Carla's awesome review for If I Stay here.

B004J4RQIM|5.0|Ever since I watched the first of the Hitman series, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this new disc and was not disappointed.    David Foster is a genius and his music style, performances and productions are excellent. Whilst this disc does not have Buble, Bocelli or Groban we see some great performances from Neyo, Earth Wind and Fire, Donna Summer, Kenny Loggins, All 4 One etc.    Young Jackie Evancho proves she is World Class and a slightly grown up, more confident, Charice gives a performance equal to any female artist on the planet now or in the past!    I bought the BluRay, which has crystal clear picture and superb surround sound.    I must say the CD which comes with it was a little disappointing with only 11 songs and no Charice, but I bought it for the 2 hours of pure entertainment and genius, which it certainly is!
0525422943|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Can I just say that if Gayle Forman wrote a text book or even a dictionary I would read it! She has a way with not only her words, but her character development that just sucks me and leaves me feeling completely satisfied at the end of her books. Well, in this case I was left feeling a bit more than satisfied. I've been struggling with how to put into words my thoughts and feelings about this awesome sequel with out giving away any spoilers, and I'll admit it's a little hard. I promise I won't spoil anything.<br /><br />Where She Went is a gripping, emotional, hopeful, fulfilling read. It's by no means one of those light and a fluffy books. I mean, how can it be when you know the promise that Adam makes at the end of If I Stay. I was completely taken and surprised with how absorbed I became with Adam's point of view. It's raw, edgy, and I couldn't help but get sucked into how he felt. There's a few scenes that I was so caught up in I totally cried, and I'm not a crier. I'll just said, the ferry scene totally got me. This scene is so crucial to both Adam and Mia as for the first time you see them completely vulnerable in every sense of the way.<br /><br />I absolutely love how Gayle alternates between present day with Adam and Mia and Adam's flash backs. It not only allowed me to get to see what Adam has been doing, and his struggles, but it allowed for Mia's family to still stay in the picture, even if it's briefly. The best way for me to describe Where She Went is to quote the back of the ARC, \\"Where She Went explores the devastation of grief, the promise of new hope, and the flame of rekindled romance\\".<br /><br />I don't know what I was excepting at the end of Mia and Adam's story, but I will say the ending is both beautifully written and perfect for their story. I highly recommend picking this book up. I think it's a story both YA fans and adults will enjoy. There is some language, there are some mentions of groupies and a tastefully written scene. Over all what may sometimes bother me in some books was very fitting and realistic for Adam's story.n scene.

B002ZG994U|5.0|I grew up watching \\"The A-team\\". And when I found out that Hollywood was going to make a movie, I started loading my guns. People were going to pay if they screwed this movie up after some of my other childhood favorites being destroyed. (tip of the hat to the person that mentioned \\"The Dukes of Hazard\\" because that movie made me want to punch kittens!)<br /><br />Then I found out that Liam Neeson was taking on the role of Hannibal Smith. Having first seen Liam in such greats as \\"Krull\\", \\"Darkman\\", \\"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\\", \\"Love Actually\\", and \\"Taken\\"... I figured how could they go wrong? And the cast of \\"The A-Team\\" did not disappoint!<br /><br />Granted there are a great many \\"Easter Eggs\\" in this film, small editorial glitches that go generally unnoticed, it still delivers a powerful action packed kick to the daddy bags. The characters are believable with out being over the top, and every one did their homework on the original cast. A guest appearance from an original cast member from the television series in the extended cut is just the icing on the cake.<br /><br />If you love action and comedy, and you love it even more when they are in the same movie, then this is a movie for you. I will admit that having a pause button on hand was almost a necessity because we were laughing so hard. I didn't realize how much I missed in theaters from all the laughing. \\"The A-Team\\" is a dynamic movie enjoyable by all!
0596809158|5.0|The R Cookbook should be on your bookshelf if you work with R.    The book is as self-described, a collection of tasks and how to accomplish those tasks in R (recipes).  This is not a tutorial on the language, but is definitely recommended for novices.  One of the most frustrating aspects of R for the beginner is to know what manipulations you require for a dataset, but to be clueless as to how to perform those steps in R; this book can help close that gap.    For intermediate users, it can serve as a reference.  I'll often use this to jog my memory as to how a particular technique is applied, e.g., run a function on each row of a dataframe. Since the book has been available on the O'Reilly Safari system for several months, it's become one of my most-used options for R info.    Technically the book appears to be accurate, with the recipes I've used functioning well.  Caveat, I have not tested any of the higher-end statistical recipes, as they aren't required in my work.    In summary, this should be one of the first books purchased when building an R library.    Disclaimer, I received access from O'Reilly Publishing to an electronic copy of this book for purposes of review.
B001R4CKGU|5.0|Harding is a talented wordsmith. He builds this story slowly, crafting one elegantly simple sentence onto another.

0316069353|4.0|I bought over 50 e-books the first year that I had my Kindle.  What a great product for those of us who read a lot and especially those of us who travel.  Taking one Kindle instead of three or four hardbacks or even paperbacks on an airplane is great!    The first year I paid $9.99 for most e-books and thought it was a fair price - in between a hardback and a paperback.  Now those same books are $14.99 when released and may go down to $12.99 after a few months.  I know the profit margins for the e-books have to be much better than paper books.  So greed has to be the driving factor.    My solution would be for the authors and Amazon to get together and cut the publishers out of the loop.  I'm sure the manuscript submitted by an author to a publishing house is already in a digital format and if not could be in a matter of a few days.  It could then be sold by Amazon at the price of $9.99 which would be at great profit margins for the author and Amazon.    Let's face it.  The world is changing and changing at an unbelievable fast pace.  The old ways of doing business are changing and need to change even faster.  So Amazon should use their unbelievable marketing and distribution model to go to a new way of publishing books.  And do it NOW!
1439102724|5.0|Jodi Picoult is the voice of the everyday woman today.  While one may not always agree with her, I believe that she attempts to give as complete a perspective of comtemporary issues as any social \\"observer\\" can.  In \\"Sing You Home,\\" Jodi has made no exception.<br /><br />Like the message or not. Jodi is what used to be known in ancient times as a \\"scop.\\" Scop means a bard or news-carrier from Anglo-Saxson England. It was a word practically obsolete by the 14th c., but revived again in the 18th c.  It is a definition of those who carried news and stories from town to town in ancient cities before people could read or write.  What I mean to say here is that Ms Picoult will be known, I believe, as an author who recorded our contemporary times and social struggles in such a way that the general population could understand them...like a scop who stopped in villages and spoke around fire gatherings giving the latest news of the \\"world.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sing You Home,\\" is a controversial novel.  And, it is a good one.  The characters are real;  their feelings and personal struggles are heavy.  Though you may not agree with every decision they make, you can understand why they make them, ultimately.  My daughter who has experienced the personal pain and emotional upheavals associated with IVF, told me she had to put the book down.  She was moved to tears, relating to the reality that Ms Picoult wrote into her characters. She was hit once again with the emotional passages she had walked. \\"How can she tell about something so intimate?\\" she wanted to know.  That's the gift Jodi Picoult has.  The gift of conveying the realities of emotional pain, horror, love and healing...the conditions of life.<br /><br />In \\"Sing You Home,\\"  the story guides us through a marriage that disintegrates and then works its way around to something more interesting.  We learn how innovative therapies such as music can reach an otherwise locked-up teenager.  And, we find that a person of age doesn't mean they are unwilling to learn and be valuable contributors to other's lives. While it's unrealistic to expect everyone to agree with decisions made by Picoult's characters, we are given an opportunity to envision the situations that many encounter in our society with it's alternative choices.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is an author of significant writing skills.  It is clear that she is capable of reaching a wide range of readers.  Her goal is to do just that.  I believe she is more than capable of narrowing her scope to a more specific following, even to her own personal perspectives alone...but she choses to reach more people with views that are as multi-faceted as possible.  This is the gift of a true writer who is committed to giving herself to her readers for the good of all.  A writer who sees her purpose as shedding light on the issues of the day, and allowing her readers to make their own, more informed decisions about them.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Sing You Home.\\"  It's a novel that will make you cry, make you think outside the box...it will make you angry, and it will expand your sense of what could be done to resolve what seems unresolvable.  It's a novel of our times for good or for bad.  It sheds a light on what different people and groups of people are thinking and living, and for the most part, I think Jodi does that in a way that's unsurpassed by other writers today.  She knows her readers, and she writes for them.<br /><br />I don't think the Christian perspective received a full and complete audit; but, nor do I think the teenager in her novel was fully developed, nor the reality of dealing with different relationships. There is much that could be written about these that was left unsaid in \\"Sing You Home,\\" so I'm wondering if it's a segway into a second book, or if she meant to leave things open ended.<br /><br />As a gift, Jodi has written some song lyrics which her friend has set to music and sings.  She has added this as a CD and it is attached to her book.  It is an accompaniment to every chapter.  I'm not one to listen to music as I read, so I have listened to it separately.  I appreciate the gift and the inner work it took for Jodi Picoult to share with us.<br /><br />If you haven't already gotten this book, I hope you'll go now and buy it.  It's an important and excellent read.  Your book groups will have a fantastic time with it, too!<br /><br />Deborah/TheBookishDamer.

I assume all of you one star price complainers can still read from paper instead of relying on a kindle.

B001FB5634|5.0|I don't have to say that the other reviewers are not all wrong.  As with movies of the type, chaos is the usual thing amongst the world so set up for us.  What you should see in this movie that love for yourself, your family, loved ones, and your fellow human beings grants many the will to live even in the face of annihilation.  Yes, we have moments where we would willing accept our fates but love to go forward and to live sometimes is all we need.  The ROAD mirrors the road of life seldom traveled.  A movie of perseverance amongst nothingness to find shreds of who we are and how we have come to be.  I urge you to look inside and find reasons to look beyond the clouds of comfortableness and see that we are a people---one people----HUMAN.       To  God, forgive us and forgive me for NOT seeing why you put us on EARTH....I get it...Thanks for your love and the gift of life...I cherish it!    Never will I take another day for granted...living this life to the fullest without regret.  Loving as hard as ever...    To Vigo and cast...thanks as this trip had to be something for you as well...    Love to All Humanity...    Dare to Live...
030726999X|5.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is an excellent book.  It is just as good as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo but better than The Girl Who Played With Fire.  Too bad that Stieg Larsson is no longer here to continue the series.
B004MOMT2M|5.0|After buying Moving Pictures multiple times, one has to wonder when enough is enough and the sound just can't be improved any more.  Unfortunately for your wallet that is not the case this time, the DVD-Audio is absolutely outstanding and hearing these songs in 5.1 definitely gives them new life.  For the most part the surround is subtle (aside from obvious moments like the car in Red Barchetta, and yes, the triangle intro to YYZ does go through some speaker acrobatics) while still providing clarity, most of which can be heard in the clarity of every tom and cymbal Neil hits (and there's a lot of them!)    As for the whole complete package, the set comes with two discs, one being a CD for on the go listening, that for my money differs very little from the Remastered CD released years ago, with maybe slightly more clarity.  The DVD has the album is Surround Sound and Stereo options, and as for extras there's a set of three extremely cheesy music videos (Tom Sawyer, Limelight, Vital Signs) and a small picture gallery that's interesting for around seven seconds.  The set also comes in fancy cardboard case and includes a nice beefy booklet with an essay from David Fricke, a bunch of very cool pictures, and (now readable sized!) lyrics.      All in all if you have the album and are fine with it as is, there's no reason to spring for this set, most will likely not care about the improvement of sound quality.  However, if you are am audiophile, enjoy DVD-Audio, or are interested in the idea, I can't recommend this set enough.      And let's face it, if you're a massive Rush fan, the type that has already seen them on the Time Machine Tour and listen to 2112 on a Saturday night at home instead of going out, you already were going to buy this, even just to hear Neil Peart's toms fly around you in Witch Hunt.  And you'll love every minute of it.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|The game itself looks and runs fine on my G2.<br /><br />I'm all for casual games but the \\"gameplay\\" of this one veered far too deep into casual territory - pieces of fruit fly onto the screen and you wipe your finger across the screen to cut them in half.  That's pretty much it.<br /><br />I played it for about 5 minutes and was supremely glad I had received it free from Amazon.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Since I can't rate the Amazon App Store I am posting this here.    Installed the Amazon App Store and downloaded Angry Birds Rio for free.    The next 3 days my phone's battery died within 9 hours.  I couldn't figure it out.  I would go into my task manager and see what apps are running and disable them.  By the way the Amazon App Store doesn't even show up.  Then I remembered the Amazon App Store so I uninstalled it.  It's been 5 days and my phone's battery life is back to normal.    I won't be installing this again anytime soon.    Either the Amazon App Store and/or Angry Birds Rio was using my phones battery so much that I was out of battery life within 1/2 day compared to 1.5 days.

The reviews I read about it mentioned how the menus are more easy on the 700 compared to the 600 so I didn't hesitate further. The last thing a noob like me wants is a complicated menu :D   For what it is worth if you have a small DSLR like the D40 which does not have commander mode for CLS you can use this flash as commander if you have to ...

B004G6009U|5.0|I grew up in the 90s, with The Lion King and Toy Story representing the pinnacle of Disney animation--the pinnacle of animation period, from any studio. With the pool crowding, however, Disney has had trouble since I've been a kid. Shrek took over; Kung-Fu Panda; Ice Age. Sure, Disney has been a major presence throughout, but it's had to put up with some stiff competition the past 10-15 years. For the record: I'm aware that there's always been competition. My point is, that for someone such as myself, Disney has always come first; no-one else could top them, even if movies from other companies make good money and get good reviews too. With these others I've listed, that has changed a little bit as I've aged. Plus I've paid less attention to so-called \\"kids movies\\", so the significance of Disney, to me personally, has waned.  With Tangled, however, Disney seems to have finally found its footing in this modern era. Wall-E and other recent Disney flicks have proven themselves capable of holding their own, but the difference with Tangled--and what makes it so significant to me--is the general storyline of a princess rather than a robot or a pack of anthropomorphic automobiles. Lion King had this to an extent (although it was a Prince/King); Toy Story didn't have this, although the story illustrated the fact that CG animation could elicit genuine emotion. Tangled, although perhaps not as memorable as either of these favorites of mine (time, as they say, will only tell) but it marks a major return to form for the king of animation. Unlike other \\"kids\\" movies, Tangled--which is full of humor, drama, and character growth--does not incorporate inappropriate humor to attract adult audiences. Rather, Tangled's humor, despite the fact that the movie is aimed at a younger audience, is genuine enough that it doesn't _have_ to have kid-proof adult-humor (ie: kids see and hear it, but probably don't understand the double entendre) to attract adult audiences. That's what I love about this movie--it's funny without resorting to low-brow inappropriate humor. No, I'm not some angry parent who hates Shrek for its gross-out raunchiness (I in fact enjoy Shrek quite a bit); I just appreciate good, classic funny and Tangled has a plenty of it.   Rather than take the easy way out, the writers and animators have done a wonderful job of making the comedy work. The dialogue is fine, but what really stands out is the character \\"acting\\". The horse, Maximus, is especially well \\"acted\\". His facial expressions and body language (that of another animal altogether, which is for some reason very hilarious) fit perfectly with every situation in which he finds himself. Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon, also expresses himself very efficiently without having a line of dialogue in the film. As surprisingly good as Mandy Moore's voice acting is, the animated acting of Rapunzel herself is amazing. With just a look, a turn of the head, the way she walks, you know exactly what she's thinking. It's truly wonderful.   Besides, the gags are all really funny too, without being raunchy. For instance, in one scene Maximus is hidden behind a peculiarly shaped and mossed-up rock, with a tree-branch conspicuously bent down--all of this with the effect of looking like a horse. All the sudden, Maximus jumps out from this situation. It may not sound funny on the page--and as I look at what I just wrote, I'm a bit unconvinced myself--but to actually see it is something else entirely. I was laughing when I saw it in the theater, along with my 35 year old aunt, 13 year old sister, and my 8 and 4 year old cousins.   Pardon my random musings on this movie. I realize that it's not an in depth review, but as usual with any reviews I decide to make, I'm writing this for people like me, people who remember the Disney of _their_ childhood (not necessarily the \\"classic\\" Disney; Snow White, Pinocchio, etc); for the people who don't think Disney matters any more. It's like we've all grown up now,and no one bothers to watch a movie if it's not violent or R-rated. It's not gritty, it's not a representation of the real-world. It's a fantasy, a fairy tale, and so on. But so what? Who says that movies have to be that way to be deemed worthy of viewing? Tangled may be a \\"kids movie\\", but I like it quite a bit.   I give it 5 stars not because I think it's a game-changing movie, not because I think it's perfect, or anything like that. Rather, it's a great \\"kids movies\\" that anyone and everyone can watch without feeling out of place. It's entertaining throughout, and that's what I look for in any movie.  ** UPDATE FOR 3D VERSION **  [I apparently can't change this review to be specifically for the 3D version, so I'm just tacking this on here.]  When I first bought my 3D TV, this (and Tron Legacy) were the first 3D Blu-Rays that I bought. Since then I've collected probably about half of the major movies that have been released in 3D, and of all of them (including Avatar) TANGLED 3D is my favorite in terms of stereoscopic 3D. The picture looks absolutely amazing and has impressed everyone I've shown it to. The 3D definitely adds to the experience, and the world really pops on screen (and \\"behind\\" screen). So if you're looking for just one 3D Blu-Ray to buy, this should be the one to add to your collection.
B001U7FW1O|5.0|Just amazing. Brilliant. Good times. GREAT times. Aaaaaaaaah. Brings back such memories. Those were the days. If people couldn't be moved by Ultravox or Midge Ure, there was something wrong. How can you not love this music? It's instantaneously memorable and catchy, makes you move, makes you feel, makes you think and just gets you up and running! Awesome. The best songs are all there, Vienna, All Stood Still, Dancing with Tears in My Eyes, Reap the Wild Wind, White China, Love's Great Adventure, Hymn, Lament, Same Old Story, One Small Day, We Came to Dance, Visions in Blue - it goes on and on! Just amazing! I mean this is text-book stuff, folks, the height of the height of the 80's New Wave electro-Brit-synth-pop! Every song is a classic on here. And to top it off, you get the DVD and see some of the coolest music videos of all time. Ultravox had some serious style. May be they weren't as big in the US as in their homeland back in Blighty, but you listen to this now, it's all totally timeless, really. You can hear the current music harking back to these sounds! It's that good! All you have to do is to look up Midge Ure on the web and you will see what an amazing person he really is - he co-wrote the Band-Aid song \\"Do they know it's Christmas?\\" man!!!!! Besides that, he was just amazing with Ultravox, as he says they were groundbreaking as well with their music videos starting with Vienna's cinematic style that everybody else started copying! The videos were also amazing as the tackled some deeply emotional and political issues, and perhaps that is why people misunderstood Ultravox as the band's songs did have a serious tone to most of them, but they made you think with their videos, they weren't just going to sit there and show you how to have a good time and be stupid, those sorts of songs and videos don't stand the test of time against such thoughtful productions as Ultravox's. Totally 5+++++++++++ out of 5 for the CD+DVD combo, absolutely.
160059672X|5.0|I love this book. It is still by my beading area and I have been looking and drooling over it on a daily basis. It has inspired one potential project already with vintage crystals. This book is an excellent resource and a great add to the Master's Series. I have done bead embroidery many years now and have used Sherry's techniques since her first article in one of the major beading magazines, not to mention the techniques outlined in her prior book. Go get this book!

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|\\"Bossypants\\" is a short memoir by comedian Tina Fey.<br /><br />At times, a laugh out loud, recollection of anecdotal tales ranging from youth to present day. What is revealed are the trials, tribulations, frustrations and truly funny events that are a part of becoming a  struggling comedian to a larger than life actor/writer for SNL and 30 Rock. Much of it  done with  tongue-in-cheek, dry humour.<br /><br />This memoir is like a shotgun going off...it sprays its load over a wide area, creating chaos (in this case, funny chaos) in a wide swarth. If I had any regret, it would be that there was no mention of her Oscar appearance with Steve Martin ( \\"Don't you dare fall in love with me\\" )...one of my favourite Oscar moments.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A real treat...I enjoyed every moment of this wonderful book.  5 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson
B003L20IFQ|1.0|This movie speaks for itself. It is not to be watched by claustrophobic people...Actually, it is not to be watched by any person who doesn't want to lose a hour and a half of their lives. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Or if you can't pass the Amazon Deal of the day up at such a amazing price..Buy it...But then do what the film says....Bury it....Deep so that it is never found. Complete and utter torturous to watch. And Im a Ryan Reynolds fan. I would rather take a hot staple in the eye....then have to be subjected to watching this hot mess ever again in my life. Because this system wont let me leave no stars I am unable to. But please do not mistake the forced 1 star for an actual 1 star for this film...No Stars for you Buried...None. Just Dirt....Lots of Dirt and a shovel.
B003NVMYSY|3.0|Its when the woman rescues the Torchwoodies stuck in a cellar that one realizes the lurking suspicion which has been growing on the viewer all through this 'filler' episode of Torchwood - it seems dreamed up by the writers after a night of creative vacuity and having watched Jeepers Creepers - the classic horror film where a killer returns every 27 years or so takes fresh victims.     The flesh eating killer in the countryside is a meme that's overcooked and this episode of Torchwood can be passed over safely. That being said, you'd miss the growing attraction between two of Torchwood's loyal members if you skipped it, so watch at least the first 10 minutes, then skip to the denounement.
0316069353|1.0|Talk of injustice, this is it. I'll wait and see if my public library gets a copy. I have more important things to do than read this and more important things to buy than this over-priced ebook.
0470503696|5.0|There are several reasons that I recommend this book.  The book covers topics with just enough depth that you don't feel overwhelmed.  It provides links to resources to get a deeper knowledge but it always keeps the target audience of beginning VBA programmers in mind.  The chapters and examples provided are also very easy to follow and not overly long so that it's something that you can pick up and put down again as you have time.    Another reason is that the author's conversational writing style makes the book easy to read and helps relieve some of the boringness of learning VBA programming concepts.    Lastly, based on my experience and other reviews that I've read, the author is very helpful and quick to answer questions.  I had a question about one of the examples in the book and it took him all of 11 minutes to reply to my e-mail with a helpful response.
0800141660|3.0|I know this one is closer to the book, but I still like the other movie version better. I like the actors that played the characters better and the story, while not perfectly true to the book, was wonderful. I was disappointed with Hugh Grant as Frederick. He was too simpering for my taste. Looked stiff in his cravat.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If your one of those few that couldn't install like me, Go in your SD card in your android_secure folder and remove your smdl2tmp1.asec file...........just to be safe save the file somewhere safe :) hope this helps great app
B003UESJHE|5.0|I just watched the PG-13 version of the film and it was great. They left the first \\"F\\" word that Firth says and dubbed the \\"S\\" word over all the rest of the \\"F\\" words for the rest of the movie. The dubbing is slightly humorous because his mouth is still saying the other word. Overall, I actually prefer this version and did not think that the film suffered at all for it.  The film itself:  Excellent Cinematography  Great Acting by all players  Good Music  Authentic and detailed set and costume design  All around tight directing and editing, this movie was well-made!  Take the whole family and read the book:  \\"The King's Speech: How One Man Saved the British Monarchy [Paperback]  Mark Logue (Author), Peter Conradi (Author)\\"  The film is just that much more enjoyable after learning more about the story, events, and people from the book.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am now on day 5, day F-I-V-E and have lost 3 inches!!  I haven't kept track of lbs because I am not overweight, but do need to \\"re-firm\\" my prob areas after last baby.  I combine this with my regular cardio every morning!  I have found myself wanting to hurry and get my 45 min of elliptical or tae bo over with so I can do this.  It is VERY challenging but fun! It goes by soooo fast! I am still on level one, but that should tell you something...I work out no less than four days a week for an hour each time. I work out hard, break a sweat everyday and push myself...now that I have began the 30 day shred I feel my health and workouts have improved x's 10!  I plan on doing level one for 10 days, 2 for 10, and so on.  Great buy, great workout!      I gave it a four because if you have any knee issue you have to be careful about your form, but J points that out.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The cloud is cool I just wish the service was included with prime membership. I can't really justify giving amazon even more money...just my opinion
0670022411|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't ended with me finding out that I have to wait for a sequel.  I agree with those that said it is perhaps a little slow and too detailed, but that didn't really bother me that much - once I was about 50 pages in, I couldn't put it down.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|Yes, it is compilation of various books but it is stunning in the scenery.  If you are a Viggo fan, you will love this movie.  He should have won an Oscar for this performance.  Can't wait for them to do the Pirates of Levant.
0439023513|2.0|Totally different reviews for the three parts of the trilogy:    Hunger Games -- Great; uplifting; inspiring!    Catching Fire -- Not as great; heart-breaking; but still enjoyable and \\"OK.\\"    Mockingjay -- Abysmally depressing; abjectly disheartening; terrible!!!    Mockingjay left such a bad taste in my mouth that it totally ruined the entire series for me (which I truly enjoyed up until that point).  Mockingjay was rushed, disjointed, and so dismally nihilistic that I could never recommend that anyone -- especially a young person -- even start the trilogy.  But, if you do start, please stop after the first volume -- or at least after the second one.  Which, come to think of it, is what Ms. Collins should have done!      Better yet, she should rewrite Mockingjay so that it lives up to its predecessors in the trilogy.  You have too much talent to leave this as such a miserable failure, Ms. Collins.  The same is true of Katniss Everdeen -- she deserved SO much better!
0307593495|5.0|Why do we read mysteries or thrillers?  Different answers for different readers I am sure. For those looking for excitement, \\"The Troubled Man\\" will likely disappoint, although it offers something good in the way of mystery, a reasonable plot that holds you a bit despite the many holes you will think about after finishing the book. But that is not what makes \\"The Troubled Man\\" so good. It works for me because it reduces my own loneliness.  Wallander is real and as he ages he suffers from all the large and the small anxieties and pains that make aging so challenging.  He gets stomach problems from drinking coffee.  Problems with his teeth. Drinks too much.  Forgets. His friends die. He has awkward, unsuccessful, unsatisfying sexual encounters, when he has any sex at all, which is not often. He dwells on his many failed relationships - with his father, his sister and his wife.  He is enraptured (too strong a word for the often emotionally listless Wallander perhaps)with his granddaughter but unduly worries about her health. I read Faceless Killers a few weeks ago and found it to be a pleasurable but fundamentally modest achievement.  This is much better. But perhaps that is because I am of the same age and facing many of the same challenges, and I appreciate sharing Wallander's woes, hopes and remaining dreams for the few hours it took to read this engaging novel.
B004S5D3B6|5.0|To much focus was on mickey's brother Dicky.....i don't know why they did this. They could have done so much with this movie. Shown actual footage from real fights, use black and white, flash backs, show more moments between brothers since that seemed to be the big theme of this movie as well as a real life Rocky figure. It seemed that I saw more of Dicky the brother in jail, and in a crack house than i did of mickey fighting.<br /><br />They had so much potential to really make this an epic film with these guys still alive. The movie was short, they had time to add parts of his real life fights, interviews, and what happened to him  after he won the belt as well....<br /><br />Many people also wonder what happens to the hero in the boxing ring who just won the world belt........i would have liked to see how they were doing financially, meaning could they retire and just train fighters for life. Could they live out the remainder of their lives living easy especially since their life was so hard? And they really did have it difficult in  my humble opinion. I am never looking for an epic masterpiece, I am just looking to be entertained one way or another.  If I feel the movie went to fast, or If I feel I wish the movie could have gone on longer, then I know I have been entertained.<br /><br />So, I don't want to give anyone the impression I did not like it or wasn't entertained.  I did love the movie, and I think they did a good job. I own this movie for a reason. I just think they could have done more with it. But it really does have it's moments, and Bale and Wahlberg did a fantastic job.<br /><br />I just felt it was a movie about dicky a bit more and not the champ Mickey.  To much screen time for Bale, and Wahlberg, not enough.  It was a little bit of a let down, but nothing that prevents you from enjoying this movie and it's theme. It is  still worth every dime to watch.....<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars because I was really entertained the whole time. I just say a little let down because it was a missed opportunity here. But loved the movie all the same.<br /><br />michael cifellitunity here. But loved the movie all the same.   michael cifelli
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I was about to buy this book and then noticed that the price is higher than the hard cover price! This is unacceptable. I love my Kindle, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to be gouged. Shame on Amazon! Behavior like this reduces my trust in Amazon and my loyalty to the Kindle; all of a sudden the ipad is starting to look like a better option.
B004S699K4|1.0|Echo Bridge's release of Halloween H20 is severly comprimised and should be avoided.  First, this release is not in the original aspect ratio.  Originally released theatrically at 2.35:1 (per imdb), this Blu-ray includes a cropped 1.78:1 aspect ratio  Second, the only audio option is a DTS-HD 2.0 stereo mix, as opposed to the 5.1 mix included as part of the original dvd release from December 1999!  Additionally, there are no subtitle options for the hearing impaired.    Lastly, there are no special features whatsoever.  So, let's see, no OAR, comprimised audio, no subs, no special features.    Remind me again why anyone would by this rush cash grab by Echo Bridge?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It was awesome until it stopped opening. I need my Angry Birds :( I am lost without it and I don't want to uninstall and reinstall and lose all progress I have made.
B0039TD826|5.0|Exile stands as a perfect example of The Stones cutting loose. No poses, just straight ahead rockin' boogie and blues. The Stones can make a legitimate claim to being true bluesman with the rawness and musical chops to back it up on this one.. There is no doubt that Jagger's swaggering vocals, almost the auditory equivalent of leering, take sentence stage here. Each song takes you into a wild roadhouse atmosphere where the Stones own the stage and let anyone try to keep up. Even with Jagger at the top of his game I find it pretty funny that my favorite cut remains Richards \\"Happy,\\" with its pretty upbeat lyrics considering the source and a bouncy rhythm that I can't get out of my head. The Stones are really known as maybe the greatest singles band in the history of rock, but Exile proves that when they are firing on all cylinders their best albums stand up just as well.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|Sound is great but whomever organized the albums screwed up big time. There is no Taxman on my vinyl Rubber Soul, and the remastered Rubber soul doe NOT have I've Just Seen a Face -  that's on Help (remaster). Huh?? Taxman has a totally different feeling and does not belong on the largely acoustic sounding and introspective Rubber Soul. Many many other inconsistencies.  What gives?  I am a  Beatle-holic, having grown up with them.  This is sacrilege.
0756404738|5.0|In keeping with its predecessor, this book is amazing. I will expect nothing less from the next one. Also, as I'm beginning to expect from Pat, the ending is bittersweet, as is life. I will admit, it made me shed a few tears as if I were attending a funeral of someone I had just begun to know. I feel I should hold off any other judgment until I read the final installment and know the whole story. For what is a middle without an ending? I can say that The Name of the Wind was a spectacular antecedent to The Wise Man's Fear, though until I know the ending, I can't tell you how great of a beginning it was.    But in itself as a story, it is thought-provoking. I cheered on and for Kvothe many times, probably more than I mourned for him and his loss. There was once where I laughed so hard I choked on my own spit, because you see, I loathe Hemme as well. (Heh...the thought of that one line still makes me chuckle.) And lastly, I dream of Ademre, but I honestly can't tell you why. I assume I am just fascinated with the introduction of a completely different culture. The man-mother myth alone...and my desire to create my own Ketan. Ah...good times. Sufficing to say, I liked it and would recommend it to everyone.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|This CD is a must buy....never mind it's been released a while now. Great grooves and selections listening back to back.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I admit that it took me about 80 pages to get hooked, but then I couldnt put it down! It had romance, intrigue, and a hero I loved. The heroine was strong, yet flawed, and I definitely rooted for her. Cant wait for the second book in the series!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I purchased this Complete First Season to have as my very own. To watch over and over because I loved it when I watch it on TV. I love the Blood, and how it is used in the series in slow motion with lots of it for shock value. I loved the sex scenes, they truly were hot. I love the half naked hunky men. What eye candy. There is something for both genders and sexual preferences. I was very happy to finally see some scenes of full nudity of the men because for yrs we have always seen woman bodies naked and topless. This show is arousing!   I felt all the actors acted very well in their parts, they were so believable.   I loved the special features. I got so used to seeing the actors as \\"Gods\\" that I forgot they were real people like me.   If you liked and enjoyed the series on TV you will like owning it to watch over again and again. I've already watch this first season since purchasing it 2 complete times including the special features. I'm a happy customer.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I agree with all those who could not install. Will someone do something about it? Apparently not the DataViz folks. Remove it from the store please!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|why buy it when its free on the android market place? that seems a bit odd doesn't it? I appreciate Amazon for providing free fun apps but really? you're going to charge us for the apps we can get for free on our native market place?
B004L79VUI|3.0|A nice effort after a long absence from the mainstream. The production is updated to suit the times and there's some nice guitar work from both Robbie and his high profile buddies. Robertson's voice, never strong, is now reduced to a sort of \\"raspy whisper\\" which can still be effective in the right setting. For me HTBC doesn't match the quality of his first two solo albums and this album's \\"autobiographical\\" lyrics are sometimes cringe-worthy (see Axman) and a bit self-important. But overall an enjoyable effort. And it's always nice to listen to an artist who is making pop music for grown-ups.
