B007MDB71O|5.0|I never got the chance to see this movie in theatres on its original release. And, that was a shame.<br /><br />While John Carter may not be the first action-adventure science-fiction, it may be the first of the super-hero genre in literature.  John, from the 19th century, is an American ex-Confederate Army officer who is transported by alien technology to Mars where he finds civilization and life not yet dead as the planet was supposed to be.  The technology is guarded by aliens, supposed to be myth, by the natives of Barsoom.  John finds himself inordinately strong able to leap great heights like a proto-superman.  Rejecting war, he is drawn into fighting for the sake of whom he first supposes to be a woman; Dejah Thoris, princess of Helium.<br /><br />Having lost his own war, and his family, a wife and son in Virginia, John finds reconciliation in his love for Dejah, as he discovers that Therns are manipulating circumstances on Mars and have similar plans for Earth.  With the support of a warring species, John fights and wins a Thern-supported war against Helium and Mars, but nothing is easy for John.<br /><br />No sooner has he won his war against the Therns, John is transported back to his actual body on Earth, in the cave of the spider-god, where his gold find remains.  John, now desperate to return to Dejah and the world of Barsoom, uses his wealth to set a trap for Thern agents on Earth in order to regain the technology he needs.<br /><br />Brilliant cinematography, humour, and the work of Canadian actor, Taylor Kitsch (\\"Gambit\\" in X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and the captivating Lynn Collins highlight this master work by Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo).  This movie is a keeper!

0812993845|1.0|I have loved all of her other books and could barely put them down. This one however, I could barely force myself to read! I purchased it for a long train ride and was planning to settle in for a fun read. Boy was I disappointed. The Amtrack magazine that they provide was better... I actually left it on a train, on purpose, for some other poor soul to pick up! Plot was trite and characters unbelievable.  WAY too much confusing and uninteresting dialogue between the characters - over one half of the book was pure dialogue . What  has happened to the author? I am surprised that they even let her publish it! Obviously, she just  coasted on her previous successes! I hope Kinesella rises from the ashes and writes another good one someday, because this was simply terrible! Do not waste your money!

B00AU15HPC|5.0|Hayward was the spirit of the Moodies. If you are a Moody Blues fan.........this is totally worth getting. Don't get the extended version of the CD with the electronic &#34;Extra's&#34; on it.......the couple extra songs suck and ruin the whole flow of the rest of the album. Just get the lesser priced album as every song is fantastic. Thank God for Justin Hayward..........killer album.
B003XT60KO|5.0|I bought this book because I see it referenced from time-to-time in various economics articles.  It is far easier to understand than I was expecting.  It is very plain English and does not require an economics degree to comprehend. The most interesting part is it was originally written in the 1940's and then updated again 50 years later to include new gov't names, etc.  Bad economics back then, are still bad economics today.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert:  The author is not a Keynesian!  (This is the current economic theory driving the Fed's Quantitative Easing and Congressional spending.)  This book clearly explains what happens when the government spends money to create jobs,  funds special bridges-to-nowhere projects or does all those other well meaning projects to garner votes and tax for the benefit of all.<br /><br />It is a must read if for no other reason than to offer a counter-point thought and broaden your understanding of what is happening today.  It will make you think.

0439023521|5.0|Well this book is as different from Collins' Gregor the Overlander series as it could be.  While the Gregor books were simply good, The Hunger Games is outstanding.  There is constant action as Katniss is literally fighting for her life most of the book.  The first time I read this book, I thought it was a sort of spoof on Survivor.  It is kind of like Survivor, except it is a fight to the death.  I read this book through in one sitting, forgoing food and water to keep reading!  I was dismayed to find that it is part of a trilogy and have been anxiously awaiting subsequent books in the trilogy to find out how it ends.  For those looking for love or romance, there is very little of that in this book.  This is something men would like as much as women, due to the lack of emotions beyond those of fear, determination, and survival against all odds.  In fact, my husband loved this book and he is not a reader.<br /><br />Things I like about The Hunger Games:<br /><br />1. The plot: so many twists!<br />2. The pacing: once you start, you just can't stop!<br />3. The world building: finally, a fantasy novel that I \\"get\\" right away, without having to read hundreds of pages to figure it out (like I did with The Demon King).<br />4. The character development.<br />5. The suspense: You would think that having already read THG twice, I would not be as caught up in the suspense---but I was. My heart was pounding at certain parts, even though I already knew what would happen.<br />6. The page turning action: just try to NOT read this one in one day, or even one sitting!<br />7. The emotion: Is there anyone who read about Prim's shirt tail slipping out of her waistband as she walks up to the stage at the reaping and didn't want to cry? I know I did! Or what about Rue and the flowers? Even Peeta's leg at the end made me sad again.<br /><br />Things I don't like about The Hunger Games:<br /><br />1. The character names were a little difficult to adjust to.<br />2. The constant focus on finding and cooking food makes me want to eat!<br /><br />If for some unearthly reason, you have not read this book, drop everything and go read it now!  I'm not a gusher by nature but I could go on and on about how great this series is!on finding and cooking food makes me want to eat!<br /><br />If for some unearthly reason, you have not read this book, drop everything and go read it now!

193700788X|3.0|It's hard to finish a series and this was a good place.  Author remained faithful to the rest of the stories.
0545586178|5.0|Wow, what a sequel!  One thing I love about Suzanne Collins is the lack of predictability in her plots.  As I read this book, I kept making guesses as to what would happen next and was pleasantly surprised to find that all of my guesses were wrong!  I just love a book that makes me gasp in surprise, and Catching Fire does just that.<br />This is a must-read, don't miss it!
0425263924|4.0|I, of course love the relationship and the chemistry between Eva and Gideon. I was glad to see she finally learned to trust him and I won't say much about the rest of the book. It started REALLY SLOW. If I wasn't as committed as I feel to the whole series, I might have just put the book down for good. It finally got good and Gideon did not disappoint. I just can't get over the ending. It's just inexcusable.And, of course, I'll have to read the next one!!
0142421715|4.0|I've been looking forward to Crossed since I closed the cover to Matched last year.  It is terrible having to wait so long for the next release in a series when the story is this good!<br /><br />One of my complaints about Matched was that there was not a lot of action.  It was heavy on the world-building.  I suspected that Crossed would have more action, and I was right.  There was so much going on.  I loved the action, especially after so much build-up in book one.<br /><br />My other complaint about Matched was that the story was so similar to Lois Lowry's The Giver.  Those similarities kept me from giving Matched five stars.  Crossed takes things in a different direction, a more unique direction, which I really appreciated.  Some of the things the Society did really stood out for me, especially the parts about the river and the cave.<br /><br />The story was a first person narrative, and switched from Ky and Cassia's points of view.  I really enjoy this type of narration.  I love knowing how each character feels about things, and it added a lot to the love story.  Knowing how both Cassia and Ky felt about the same events added some depth to their relationship.<br /><br />I loved the surprise about Xander.  I did not see that coming, not at all, and it really served to make his character more interesting.<br /><br />The main thing that comes to mind when I think of Crossed is how beautifully it is written.  The prose is haunting and lyrical.  It reads like poetry, so full of feeling and depth.  I loved the emphasis on poetry and literature.  I loved that Cassia is a reader, and how she feels about books.  The simplicity of the writing emphasizes the emotions of the characters.  I felt everything the characters were feeling: terror, love, excitement, and most importantly, hope.<br /><br />There are so many good things I could say about this series.  I would recommend it to anyone!
B0064QNS62|3.0|Overall it is not bad. Controls are the biggest drawback since it is a bit difficult to mastwr. It situations reuiring precision it can be frustrating. It woupd be good to have some decent background music - it has no music just crude sounds.
1416972250|5.0|Dear Cassandra Clare,<br />I love your writing.  I have read all three of your novels.  Twice.  Can you please write faster?  And in your next book, we need an Isle of Esme chapter.  I think you know which characters we want to vacation there.<br />Waiting patiently,<br />Kelli<br /><br />I love this series!  The writing is excellent, I can relate to the characters, I like the side love stories, and the plot has lots of twists and turns.  It's rare that I like a series written in the third person this much.  I like Clary.  She is growing up as the books progress and I like her personality.  I love that Clary gets nervous and has racing thoughts.  That makes her so relatable!  Even if you are not a fan of the paranormal genre, I would recommend the Mortal Instruments series.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />This is a very small gripe, but Clare uses the phrase \\"scrambled to her/his feet\\" a lot.  Why not \\"stood up,\\" \\"got to her/his feet,\\"  or \\"rose\\"?  Just a small annoyance.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The imagery is outstanding.
B005FITIIC|4.0|Director and writer J. C. Chandor makes an impressive debut with this taut financial thriller.  With a host of \\"A\\" list actors in the cast, Chandor manages to take the abstruse world of Wall Street shenanigans that sent markets reeling in 2008, and makes them palatable for viewer consumption.<br /><br />Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), a 19 year veteran manager of a Lehman Brothers-like firm is abruptly fired along with many others in the trading division.  He hands off information he had been working on to Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), a subordinate analyst.  Peter, who has a Ph.D. in rocket propulsion or something, is able to finish Eric projections.  They suggest that the bundled mortgage-backed securities owned by the firm will soon become worthless.  As this information is elevated throughout the firm, the various players work throughout the night to figure a way out.<br /><br />Key players include Paul Bettany as Will who is Eric and Peter's boss.  He reports to Sam Rogers (terrific Kevin Spacey) who heads up the trading division.  Even higher in the food chain are risk manager, Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore), CEO Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) and chairman John Tuld (cool and collected Jeremy Irons).  Irrespective of their decisions, it would appear that the firm is toast, so the calculation is how to get out with the least pain, at least for those at the top.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Chandor's story manages to create empathy for most of the players here.  With the exception of Cohen who suggested the risky strategy with hesitant help from Robertson and Tuld who made the decision, others were unaware of what was going on.  Many innocent employees of the firm will ultimately lose their job.  The firm makes a decision to sell all of their assets, without acquiring new ones.  As the word quickly gets out about the fire sale, the firm and the rest of those involved in risky financial vehicles like this bring the economy to its knees.  The rest is history.<br /><br />The movie works in real time which adds a layer of intrigue as implications sink in for all involved.  This is a terrific film that provides an easy to understand look at the inner workings of one investment company.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p and has a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  While there is nothing eye popping the transfer looks very good with a pleasant blue hint of tint (suits, ties, etc.) in many scenes.  The night shots of NYC look great with the bright lights of the skyline contrasting with the dark sky.  The audio has a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which is also very good if not profound.  With the exception of a bustling trading floor and some exterior scenes most of the dialog heavy film is shot inside small rooms.  Extras include a commentary with Chandor, some deleted scenes, a gag reel, a 6 minute \\"making of\\" segment and some photos.vie works in real time which adds a layer of intrigue as implications sink in for all involved.

1416955070|5.0|What a great start to a fantastic series.  This was my second time reading City of Bones, and it was just as good the second time around.  Cassandra Clare's fantasy world contains vampires, faeries, werewolves, mermaids, demons, warlocks, and Nephilim, who are the Shadowhunters who devote their lives to killing demons.  Clary is just an ordinary human, or so she thinks.<br /><br />I love the way Clare writes.  It is very descriptive without being too wordy or melodramatic.  Her writing reminds me of Stephenie Meyer, and I mean that in a very good way.  I like that Clary is a normal girl.  I can't stand reading about a perfect, unrealistic character.  I have found in the past that the first novel in a series is not as good as the subsequent novels (think Harry Potter or Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking of the Rachel Morgan series).  That is not the case here.  Fans of Harry Potter, Vampire Academy, and Twilight will love this series.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />It's a little teen angst-y at times.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The fantasy meshes very believably with the \\"real\\" world.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|my 2 year old grandson loves this game!  He gets mad b/c we only let him play it for an hour a day so he don't get hooked on playing video games only.  But when he goes to sleep at nite his Nana. turns the sound down so she can play lol
0439023513|3.0|Anyone who has read the first two books knows that they are full of action---they are pretty much non-stop the entire time.  I was expecting the same out of Mockingjay, and was very surprised when the whole book felt slow.  It was almost like the book was a transitional, world-building piece that had all of the action in the last 40 pages.  I found that to be very disappointing.  You know what the tone of the book reminded me of?  Sookie's raw emotions in Charlaine Harris' Dead in the Family and Zoey Redbird's shattered soul in PC Cast's Burned.<br /><br />Katniss is not her usual fighting self in Mockingjay.  She has been almost irreparably damaged by the events in The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, and a lot of the book focuses on her emotional upheaval and subsequent attempts at healing from injuries both physical and emotional.<br /><br />The world-building was, as usual, superb, but the plot was too predictable.  The first two books transcended the YA genre while this one definitely had a simpler, YA plot.  I predicted all of the ending events well before they occurred---something I hate to be right at!<br /><br />The whole book has left me somewhat unsatisfied---don't get me wrong, it's still a very good read, but it's not as good as what I expected.  After two years of waiting for the series to be concluded, I expected more out of Mockingjay.  I was ready for it to be as stalker-worthy as The Hunger Games and Catching Fire; however, the first two books were much better.<br /><br />I can't stop thinking about Mockingjay.  I can't stop talking about it either---I am so disappointed with the book as a whole that my husband has decided not to read it.<br /><br />I have read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire three times each.  My last read through of the two was this past weekend, in preparation for Mockingjay.  Every time I read those books, I feel like I could read them again immediately.  I did not feel that way about Mockingjay.  Frankly, I don't know if I'll ever read it again---I am that disappointed.  I know I am in the minority here, but this is how I feel.<br /><br />Things I liked about Mockingjay:<br /><br />1. The world building<br />2. There were a couple of surprises<br />3. I liked the parts about Buttercup<br />4. We got to know some of the characters better---namely Finnick, Haymitch, Gale, and Prim<br />5. I like Gale's ending---he rises above his Seam upbringing and coal miner history<br /><br />Things I didn't like about Mockingjay:<br /><br />1. A lack of character growth for Katniss<br />2. The pacing was slow for the entire book, yet the ending felt rushed<br />3. I feel like Collins wrote this book half-halfheartedly.  Was she juggling the demands of Mockingjay and the screenplay to The Hunger Games?  It almost feels like she had a ghost writer helping her out here.<br />4. The tone of the book is dark and depressing---I get that Collins is trying to make a point about there being no winners in war but I don't like a book to preach to me.  It didn't have the same feel as the first two books.<br /><br />More things I didn't like---SPOILER ALERT---STOP HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ Mockingjay!<br /><br />1. I felt like I was reading about a mental patient the entire book: the way Katniss cries, hides, and gets medicated every time something happened along with her willful disobedience and paranoia.<br />2. Katniss was in the hospital too much---it was an overused plot device: something upsets Katniss, she gets drugged into submission and ends up in the hospital OR Katniss gets hurt, ends up in the hospital, rides a morphling wave which covers her feelings, and recovers slowly while napping in closets all the time.<br />3. The entire book, Katniss is reacting to situations beyond her control instead of making her own decisions.<br />4. Katniss is supposed to love Peeta, but when he comes back from the Capitol damaged, she gives up on him and ignores him.<br />5. The ending felt out of character---I would have rather she died a hero then end up a shell of a person, just existing---like Haymitch.  Basically, Katniss turns into Haymitch.  Where's the fighter we all loved in the first two books?<br />6. Will someone please tell me how Peeta magically gets cured of his brain hijacking?  Oh wait, he must have been cured by Katniss' love.  No, that's not right, because she doesn't decide that she loves him until the very last page and it is very casual.  So, Peeta gets cured by icing Finnick's wedding cake?  The failed mission to kill President Snow?  Or, is it when Gale leaves for his job in District Two?  We'll never know...it's magical, like Edward's diamond skin.<br />7. Katniss knows that Gale had a hand in making the bomb that killed Prim.  She gives up on five years of friendship just like that---it felt so flat, the way she just gives up on Gale.  One second he's there, one second he's gone.  Her best friend---vanished.<br />8. There were characters from the first two books that are dropped without a thought---like Madge and her family.  I felt like Collins could have included their stories to flesh out the plot.<br />9. The casual treatment of the MANY deaths in this book.  Why did so many people have to die?  And so casually?<br />10. The book is very violent and gory.  I don't think it's appropriate for younger teens.<br /><br />I urge you to put aside your \\"team affiliation\\" feelings and objectively consider this book on its own---not in the context of being part of a series.  When I think of the series as a whole, Mockingjay gets more stars.  When I think of Mockingjay on its own, it is just not that great for me.  I feel like Collins could have done so much more with this book.ve rather she died a hero then end up a shell of a person, just existing---like Haymitch.  Basically, Katniss turns into Haymitch.  Where's the fighter we all loved in the first two books?<br />6. Will someone please tell me how Peeta magically gets cured of his brain hijacking?  Oh wait, he must have been cured by Katniss' love.  No, that's not right, because she doesn't decide that she loves him until the very last page and it is very casual.  So, Peeta gets cured by icing Finnick's wedding cake?  The failed mission to kill President Snow?  Or, is it when Gale leaves for his job in District Two?  We'll never know...it's magical, like Edward's diamond skin.<br />7. Katniss knows that Gale had a hand in making the bomb that killed Prim.  She gives up on five years of friendship just like that---it felt so flat, the way she just gives up on Gale.  One second he's there, one second he's gone.  Her best friend---vanished.<br />8. There were characters from the first two books that are dropped without a thought---like Madge and her family.  I felt like Collins could have included their stories to flesh out the plot.<br />9. The casual treatment of the MANY deaths in this book.  Why did so many people have to die?  And so casually?<br />10. The book is very violent and gory.  I don't think it's appropriate for younger teens.<br /><br />I urge you to put aside your \\"team affiliation\\" feelings and objectively consider this book on its own---not in the context of being part of a series.  When I think of the series as a whole, Mockingjay gets more stars.  When I think of Mockingjay on its own, it is just not that great for me.  I feel like Collins could have done so much more with this book.
B003FFEX8C|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, it is something different from batman all the time.  It is cute and has a chick very on things
1416972242|5.0|This was even better than City of Bones!  The plot was great, the love angle(s) were great, and the character development was great.  This series has a great love story, based on a forbidden love which is our Achilles' heel.  Forbidden love gets us every time!  Another thing I like about Cassandra Clare is that she titles each chapter.  The title is usually like a little teaser about the chapter content.  I like that a lot.<br /><br />I love this series!  The books definitely need to be read in order.  If you haven't read Cassandra Clare before, I highly recommend this series.  Fans of Twilight, The Hunger Games, and Harry Potter will enjoy City of Bones and City of Ashes.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />The writing sometimes gets a little heavy because Clare uses a lot of analogies.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The plot.  It's suprisingly complex for a YA series.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|this mic performs as well as 100 dollar ones do, wonderful sound, i could not be happier. i plugged into my laptop
B002U1F32M|5.0|Love this movie. 500 Days of summer is not your typical love story. It's a love story with a twist.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|great writing and acting<br />superior to anything i'm seeing on the big screen<br />a really suburb show, brian cranston is a marvel and supporting cast excellent.
B007P2DQJI|5.0|This is an original battery made by Samsung, not a cheap knockoff. It holds charge just like my old battery used to when my phone was brand new. The NFC works great on it too. I recommend this to anyone who needs to replace the original battery that their Galaxy Nexus came with.
0345803485|5.0|This book definitely lived up to my expectations!! Starts kind of slow but once you get into it.....look out!! Can't wait to read the next 2 and to see who they could possibly get to play Christian Grey!!!!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Geared toward younger kids, but fun nonetheless. I agree with the posting about having to pull back the ball to shoot, it is a bit annoying.
B000RD0RDU|1.0|Cable was not the length of considerable use, I would not send back because the cost was more thatn just the loss of funds
B002ZG974M|5.0|girls have been watching this for years now. now that we have another baby they've started watching it again. great movie for adults and kids.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|This book was rather difficult to follow regarding the characters, who the author was talking about and where the scenes were taking place.  I read the entire book and liked it until the middle of the book when it got so confusing.  I guess if read in a couple of sittings you might follow better, but for me it was too confusing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|just read it. thousands of positive reviews and you can get through it in a day. you'll be glad you did.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|A page-turner. I read books 4 in this series in two weeks, starting with this one. Adventurous and very enjoyable sci-fi.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I have never met a series of books before that so captivated me that even when the narrative was from another character's point of view (even a character who was completely new to me) I was still entranced enough that I didn't feel the urge to jump ahead in the book and find out what happened to the character I was originally following. George RR Martin has a way of making you care for even minor characters and showing all the subtle nuances of humanity - no one is purely good or evil - we are all capable of both and it is dependent on who is observing as to what acts are seen as which.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app provides hours of fun. I have never had any problems with this app since I purchased it. It nevers lags or causes any problems. Great game to play in the car or just sitting around.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|This was a really good movie,a must see! Sad in some respects and funny in others. I would watch this movie again.
0061777269|5.0|This is a recommended read if you are looking for information on the subject.Written by a cardiologist with many years expereience , you can't ignore the facts anymore...
B005HSL626|1.0|Does not fully work on kindle fire. Very buggy. Freezes allot. I had high hopes for this game. I looked on the paid version ready to buy it when I saw people saying it's the same as the free version. No difference. So I got the free version instead. Played 1 game. Went off for maybe a minute to a different game. Went back on. It froze. Wouldn't let me slash the fruit. Do not get if you own a kindle.
B004UID2LC|1.0|When I want to open this app it won't open. It is very frustrating because I really want to watch a video!! Don't get it!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Give everyone $100,000 coins for playing the game.I love this game but every character should be free .I have 1million friends on subway surfers and if u don't do what I said I'll let all of my friends know.now take take.
1490313370|4.0|James has great insight on almost everything.  If you haven't read his blog, give it a chance.  Look up the older stuff first to get an idea of who he is.<br /><br />One thing to take into account, about the book is James is his own person.  Some things he does works for him but may not work for you.<br /><br />One of the things I took out of the read, is that he figured out what works for him.  Now I have to figure out what precisely works for me.<br /><br />Ryan
B0060MYM3S|5.0|cant wait for next season to be available, acting is great story line follows the book well, which is important
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|Really good game, GREAT graphics, feels good, very playable, probably should be more free levels, but still great value, worth a play
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Great am reading the books and did not want to see the show until I was ahead of the BBC show.  Love the Imp.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|If you liked Empire or earlier stuff, you'll like this one too.  Lots of variety and many of those elements we love in classic Queensryche.  The bold tri-ryche symbol on the cover looks more like a Phoenix, rising from the ashes, after you listen to this album. Nice work guys!
B008KE3960|4.0|not the classic tower defense game. you have to constantly set flight paths for your planes. a different spin on tower defense, but fun to kill time with
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|While I don' t like it as much as Era Vulgaris or Songs for the Deaf, I was impressed by the artistic quality of this disc.<br /><br />The songs were produced well and have a crisp sound.<br /><br />Some are not as heavy as I would have liked, but I will listen to them over and over anyway.
1781162646|5.0|Typical King story,well written, cohesive.  I liked the little twist at the end. I also enjoyed the trip back in time,to a somewhat more laid back era. Well done Stephen.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|While I was not as jazzed on this cd as I was on Black Gives Way To Blue, I thought this cd was pretty good.<br /><br />It has the distinctive A i C sound.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|To call this a movie is an insult to movies.  This is not just junk food for the brain; it's poison.  Poison for the mind and soul.  It's essentially a program of desensitization, where death becomes mundane and humanity is thrown out completely.  Instead of entertainment, we get \\"enemies\\" who are nameless, faceless stereotypes fed on a continuous diet of Red, White and Blue colored lead.  This is everything that is rotten in our culture, and Hollywood specifically.  When we allow our kids to view junk like this, their reality is distorted just a bit more.  Well not at my house.  Not in my world.  It's time some people stood up to the segment of Hollywood that cranks out this violent, mindless trash and says \\"enough\\".  These films are a danger to society, and it's about time thoughtful, intelligent people said so openly.  To ignore it is to encourage it.  Boycott these films with your dollars and they will go away.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|Awesome movie full of action adventure and thought provoking information very well done stayed true to the book with tantalising glimse of the tenth insight to look forward to five stars
B0088P2A7A|3.0|Honestly, it's just the mobile version as a app. It dosen't really bring anything new to the table. That and it's not necessarily fast.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it very fun and makes you really entertaining mind boggiling.  Very addicting found myself playing all day and finding clues was the best part. Keeps you thinking the whole way
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|addicting<br />always go back to it can restart over and over and don't. get bored love it can play for hours
193700788X|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of the Sookie novels. I knew that after 13 books they needed to end, but I was still extremely sad. It feels like losing your friends. Even though the ending wasn't what I wanted it was perfect.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for more...please hurry. Captivating and very challenging. Not your ordinary puzzle type game. Even 7 year old grandson enjoyed trying to help.
B0091REZMW|3.0|this whole buying things with diamonds but not giving enough ways to earn them so to complete a lot of the quests you have to pay money. you can still progress through the levels but slowly and without completing the timex challenges.
B0083SBMBM|1.0|The Disc only played once.  Months later when I tried to play the disc again it would not play and continually locked my played into a loop.  This is the only disc that has done this.  I tried other discs and they all played just fine.  Unfortunatly the return date has expired and I cannot get a replacement.
B00C6B9976|1.0|The blu-ray had previews but no movie, will be returning! This is not the first time this has happened to me
B00A77II0U|5.0|FREAKIN' AWESOME game!!!!! Hours of fun.  I can't wait 'til the next edition!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!<br />Please hurry and make a new chapter.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|this app is a lot like the app can you escape. It is hard and frustrating at some parts, but then its easy at some points too. I had to go on youtube sometimes but it is a fun game to play to pass the time. If you think I'm wrong then write a comment/review. Enjoy<br />ADIOS
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and have thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I would recommend it to anyone that asked me about it.
B0030P1WKY|5.0|This book truly clarified why the universe over and over has blocked me whenever I behaved in a certain way. Now I know why. Also you don't need to know anything about astrology to enjoy this book.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr Alexander's writing is simple yet beautiful. His experiences are so fascinating and exude the love he speaks of... A love we all long to feel.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|This is simply one of the best books ever written.  Sure to become a classic.  May already be one.  You won't be sorry!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It took me a while to figure out how to play this game. But once I understood how it worked, I even got my granddaughter hooked. I had to cheat on level 10, but finally got it completed. Give it a try. You will want to keep playing
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Interesting concept. Could have integrated the characters and their connections to that past a little more. I would recommend watching it..
B00AK57N00|3.0|Grandson played it for a few minutes and I tried it too.  Too repetitive for me and there doesn't really appear to be a lot of skill required.
B00498YZH8|3.0|This is a decent movie. It isn't extremely interesting, but does make you feel sorry for people living in these conditions.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|This was a very good album and I look forward to hearing more from her.  Rivers is one of my favorites.
B006QPX7UI|2.0|A slow moving movie. Way too long and could have been condensed to make it more interesting. If you have 4 hours and keep up the interest then watch it.
B0042JSMV4|5.0|I ordered this book for my android and I love it! It has lots of great borders to keep me busy!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Boring reading, was not kept interested and could predict what was going to happen. Could not finish the book and would not recommend.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|For me, its either 1 star or 5 star, 0 or 1, works or doesn't work.<br /><br />The SODIMM went into my NAS and worked first time and still works.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble's \\"To Be Loved\\" has gotten mixed reviews here on Amazon.  I take Amazon reviews seriously, which made me wonder about purchasing this disk  But I also take Buble seriously, so I ultimately dove in.  I've owned the CD for about 2 months now, and I purposefully waited that long to see what I would think.  I recommend this CD.<br /><br />In many ways, it is like most of Buble's modern disks: a nice combination of freshened-up standards, duets and a few original songs.  Virtually all of these songs succeed.  Everyone in my house enjoys this disk: wife, my kids and me.  I think the cat even likes it.  (As for the dog, well, she likes everything, so that's not much of an endorsement.)<br /><br />Is it a perfect album?  Is it Buble's best?  No, it isn't.  I remain mystified at the song \\"Something Stupid.\\"  The choice of song is fine -- the Sinatra original is fun, and it is the kind of song to which Buble can easily add his own touch.  But Reese Witherspoon on duet -- why?  Outside the context of this album, I have no particular axe to grind with Ms. Witherspoon, but, put simply, she adds absolutely nothing here.  There are any number of female vocalists who might have brought some ying to Buble's yang in this song.  Ms. Witherspoon's voice, though, is flat, plain and almost inaudible at times.  In spite of that, I still like Buble's rendition, but this is one of those \\"might have been\\" songs had different choices been made during production.<br /><br />I still gave this 5 stars.  Probably, I would have given it 4.5, if that was an option.  I think it is a pretty solid album, and I can see using it, along with Buble's other disks, for years to come.  You may quibble with some of the songs, choices or execution, but, in my judgment, most Buble fans will enjoy this disk and not regret its purchase.
B00CX1TSSO|3.0|I am sure some will like this movie a great deal and some will find it a waste of time. I enjoyed it and by chance had streamed shortly after another movie called &#34;Warm Bodies.&#34; The lead who played Jack is also in the other movie and I believe he does far better in &#34;Warm Bodies&#34; than in Jack the Giant Slayer.<br /><br />The visuals of the movies are nicely done, the writing is a mixed bag and at times it isn't clear if this is really a fantasy with drama or approaching the edge of camp with some of the elected to use humour to offset intensity. Again, I did enjoy the movie but would only recommend it to friends who like fantasy films in general.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is an excellent brain game to escape to.  love the idea of these games.  keep them coming.  one glitches...the sound would not stay off but can not really complain since I turned the volume down
B00CF34B2I|5.0|As a Magic Player, I am very excited to be able to finally build my own deck on this game! So cool! :-)
B009NY43NY|5.0|This final book of the Sookie Stackhouse series was amazing! I coul not have wished for a better ending to a wonderful series.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The Innocent, right, so  many trips down memory lane.<br />The famous words of a book reader: &#34;You cannot stop reading!&#34;<br />Yes, The Innocent is very enthralling, there I said it, yes I mean what I say...
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Love the writing of Paulo coelho. Found this book educational and interesting. Added it to my read list on the kindle. will read it again cause it is worth the reading!
0671449028|5.0|A nice little bedtime story.  Sandra Boynton never disappoints with her children's books.  A little bigger than some board books which is also nice.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is a very accurate simulator all names are correct and this is just a highly rated game over all
B0082SU98U|5.0|Nice inspiring book A MUST READ!!!!!!!  If you feel sad or you are not contented with what you have, then read this book till the last page its a wonderful story by Eleanor Hodgeman.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love this game it's very challenging &amp; I'm all about finding clues &amp; getting outta there lol<br />....
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was challenging.  I enjoyed it. I am looking forward to more in the future.  I will recommend this game to my friends.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Truly a great game tons of fun, highly recommended, and a great pass time. If you love the card game you will love this app version.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I was very pleased with this game.  It wasn't extremely hard but not too easy.  I look forward to more floors.
1606865617|2.0|I decided to purchase this book after hearing Ms. Roy speak one afternoon on NPR. Her opinions, her choice of words, and even the sound of her voice pulled me in, made me want to find out more about her and see what her work was about. In keeping with that intrigue, her work is truly poetry. Her descriptions are painterly and lush. She was able to vividly create for me an entire world, though I have never been anywhere like it. I could see it, smell it, taste it. That aspect of the book is wonderful. The story, on the other hand, was utterly disappointing. And what is a book, if not a story? Is that not why we read a book? There are stomach churning incidents that are planted as motivation for later actions, which are not borne out. There are deviant acts which are never punished, and non-deviant ones which are punished with such savagery, they are difficult to read. No one receives retribution for this injustice. No one even feels badly, except two children who were manipulated into complicity.<br />I do not need my stories wholely resolved and wrapped into a neat bow. But there must be at least an emotional resolution. An emotional death. There was none here. There was an almost-care. And then an end.
0316201561|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this book.<br /><br />Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell was jammed pack with adventures in every chapter.<br /><br />I loved the \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" humor and the \\"not perfect endings\\" of several fairy tale characters.<br /><br />I can't wait to read Land of Stories: The Enchantress returns!
0670026638|5.0|This was one of those books that during the first chapter, I wasn't sure I'd make it all the way through. I am so glad I continued. This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It took me a while to like or even care about the main characters, but after I started to understand where they came from, my opinion changed and I was drawn in. Nao's diary took us on a journey that shows how circumstances can change the fragile dynamics of a family. This book also explores the relationship between the author and the reader of a story. Throw in a little Zen philosophy and family history and you have a really great story. I am looking forward to this author's next work.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|I love this movie!  The blu-ray disk worked well, the movie was hilariously awesome, and I'm pleased with the purchase.
B007REV4YI|1.0|NOT even remotely close to the James Bond I grew up to know. Banal story, charachters & acting. Won't make such a mistake again, Hollywierd. ;^)
B008RTE066|4.0|The package arrived with no dents or creases whatsoever. The movie, now considered a classic, played great. Nicely done now amazon. I just bought this bundle, honestly, because i needed it to complete my collection. The only con i can see is that the printing press didn't do a hell of a job on the cover since it looks kind of cheap when you look at it through your own glass eye. Still, it's The Beatles and i could not be happier today. Better because i paid 50 bucks including shipping and handling for a once hundred dollar product.<br />Now, the movie. It's bad. And boring. Paul's failure; but the music is strong, well presented and everything you have come to love about them. Glad i got the deluxe boxed set, it fits nicely beside my good ol, Beatle vinyls. Great!
1451695195|5.0|Provocative and highly recommended reading especially for people with scientific backgrounds who have reservations about the traditional descriptions of heaven.
1616550414|2.0|The book starts quite well with Mr. Miyamoto's views and thoughts of what he and his team originally envisioned. The drawings and artwork are pretty good, and the middle part, where it looks like you're reading an ancient book add a glowing spark to this one; the bad part was my book had creases and dings made by the shipping process and i really can't or won't read a full book with those things on it. I'm quite paranoid with my stuff, but the reading pleasure is killed when one of these books arrive like this one did. Back to the contents; i really wished they would have included the inserts that came with the american releases from the legend of zelda (the hyrule map, for example), or the beautiful land made of clay on the original booklets...nothing like this appears i guess, this happens because it's the translation of an original japanese book. An entertaining afternoon read but nothing else. Even to die hardcore Zelda fans. I guess i just bought it to complete my Zelda collection but won't be coming back to it in a long time.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|Very cool features, but not so cool if the program crashes Every. Single. Time. you try to use them (meme feature is an example). What's really interesting is that the crash consists of losing everything you've worked on, the photo disappears, etc., yet the app itself doesn't close, as you might expect during a crash. Nope; this crash? Loses all your work, then takes you to the &quot;Rate us 5 stars!&quot; popup. SMH.
0525478817|4.0|Good Read for adolescents and adults.  I enjoyed getting into the mind of the main character:  what she thought about her interaction with others, especially in light of fighting cancer, her relationship with her parents and friends, and her wise insight.
B006ZEDZNY|3.0|I was disappointed in Johnny Depp's performance.  I would not recommend for an academy award.  I would say just an average film.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fast, Fun, Addictive. Would like to be able to put my name in the Scores, though, and needs to allow you to save in progress if you need to leave the game. Good colors, fun add-ons.
B00C6BB2JE|4.0|I happen to like action movies and Hugh Jackman. I have never written a review, but I liked this action movie.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I like this very much mostly because I am a fan of Celtic Woman.  Also, the lineup of the group changes often so this is a snapshot in time of the group as it was then.  Highly recommended!!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Thought it would be a fun new game for me, however, like so many others, game didn't work on my Kindle. Disappointing<br />cause it got so many wonderful reviews. I hope they decide to fix the problem.
B00797MB0O|3.0|It was ok, and I mean just ok. All the actors did a great job, but I can't help but echo what other reviewers have said. \\"I kept waiting for something to happen.\\" I though, towards he end, that she might somewhat redeem herself, but.... well, hmm. it's up to you to decide that, and to watch it.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I really like Calculator Plus because its easier for me to do my math and its right there. Also, its free!!!!!
B005C0DHEY|4.0|I never knew about fracking or what the natural gas industry was all about so I thought I would try this movie. It was very interesting, educational, and disgusting at the same time. After I watched it, I wa sad to learn that my mom and step dad live by one of these locations where fracking is taking place. This is a good movie to get informed about what is going on in our natural gas industry!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is soooooo realistic. I love it so much and it is super fun. I have a new pet horse now!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This might be the best out of the three, tad long but still action packed and fun to watch. Awesome to see the likely start of Robin's beginnings!
B0000DIXDR|1.0|I ordered this movie, but was sent Grease instead. Don't get me wrong, I like Grease too, but I was really looking forward to seeing Dirty Dancing. So, What happened to the Dirty Dancing movie I ordered??
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|What is there to say about this movie? It's just sheer genius and now that its upscaled to Bluray it will survive yet another few generations!
B00AEFY5TI|4.0|The movie is good quality. But I ordered Dirty Dancing. didn't get it. I'm not sure who is responsible for the mix up.
B004G6009U|5.0|This movie was just pretty much perfect. Super Funny, Super Cute, and super age appropriate for smaller children unlike a lot of the darker 'kids' movies that had and have been coming out. Great for adults to watch too with all the humor.
B0075MFS9Y|1.0|I must be getting to old for music. I thought the album, besides the song Ho Hey, was mono-toned junk. Yet, I see hundreds of 5 star reviews. I won't be listening to this again...unless of course, I lose my hearing and can only hear a single tone. Then it will play non-stop.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Good movie with an interesting plot, very absorbing flow and really good actors. Plus who doesn't like the idea of friendly alien visitors with a good moral message?
B0059WTMLW|3.0|I prefer the first one I got.  I believe it is by genia or something like that.  I find it much easier to use.  Maybe I need to give this one a chance but so far it's not my go to Sudoku.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Over all I really liked this movie, was a bit of a darker story than I was expecting for a childrens movie, so I wouldn't necessarily show this to super young kids but still a fantastic movie.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This could really be addicting.  My only wish would be a little more explanation of when and how the color wheel, bomb, color bombs etc work. I have figured out much of it by trial and error.
B0073U2F2Q|5.0|I actually really liked this movie, it was a new idea. A little hokey at times but over all the premise was actually very good and the effects were pretty cool.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|this is the 3rd cd in a trilogy and a great one at that. he sounds fabulous. plus a bonus dvd with 4 songs
B0013ND36G|5.0|Good movie showcasing more of Mr Arnold. While he is starting to show more of his age in this movie he is still a tough bot and continues on the story very well.
B000I5X80G|5.0|this is a great live neil young and crazy horse cd. there are only 6 songs but they are classics
B000L212HC|5.0|Really enjoyable movie, decent storyline, great visuals and an all star cast really made this movie shine and do well.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|the energy on this cd and dvd is through the roof. the cd has bonus songs and the dvd has bonus live videos
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Over all I really liked this show, good story neat visuals, good action. Then the fight comes at the end. Builds up to be epic and then is suddenly over leaving you confused.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|a single cd with some of neils greatest hits. what more can you say it has 16 songsand an info book that is also a poster
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|Great movie that started it all. When I saw it was remastered on BluRay I jumped on it, digitally safe for future generations to know why Skynet is evil.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this every day and I love it. Its a great game for people 10+. I love the new update as well.
B003HARV4S|5.0|Edward Norton does a great job in this one and personally I like it better than The Prestige that was released at about the same time. The other had better visuals but I think the story in this movie was much better.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This. Is. Perfect. 100000000000000000000000000% yes yes yes yes yes buy it, rent it, whatever, just WATCH IT! Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper are so awesome and I just can't get over them! Eeeek! Really, this is worth every penny, hour, lifetime you use on it--and if you're a Whovian you get all of this already.
B005LAII1C|4.0|Over all this was a pretty funny movie, it could be pretty vulgar at times ( which is saying something from me ) with the language and such but I was also watching the unrated version which I'm sure added to that but still a funny movie and worth a watch if that doesn't offend you.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love Bruno Mars!!!  His Songs are the best!!!  He can really write songs that bring out emotion and what I feel inside!  He is awesome!!!!
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Even though we know how this story actually ends you are still pretty riveted throughout the whole movie. I am sure they took some creative liberties with things but thats hollywood. Very well done and great to watch.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I played the lite version for like 2 weeks nonstop, and finally caved in and bought the full version, best 3 dollars I'VE spent on the kindle app store! Great game if you can climb that short learning curve (takes like 10 minutes!)
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|The movie was ok. The previews made it look a lot more interesting than it really was and made it sound like it was all about the song that is written in it, when its really not. The transition through time back and forth really was pretty confusing and just filled with stuff that was flat out boring and didn't need to be there making the movie just under 3 hours long. If about an hour and a half of fluff was cut from it, it would actually be pretty decent.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I downloaded this on my kindlefire because its with me a lot and I have to pull out my calculater when I do my homework. But know I use the calculator plus and it is so handy and easy to use. I would suggest this to other students and parents because its a wonderful tool to have in your kindle; or ipod.
B0090SI460|5.0|It's Monsters Inc, what could there possibly be to say? It's a fantastic Pixar movie and Boo is still the greatest character.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the greatest book I have ever read. It deals with so many issues reflected of this main character of Ender Wiggin.  It deals with the idea of morality, of children, and of how the world reacts to situations. This is defiantly a re-read for me.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is just a classic B movie from the 80's. Interesting sound track and just a great story line. Something that is strangely relatable even though its in some neo tokyo future. Since this includes the directors cut as well it is almost like 2 or more movies since the original cut and the directors were really so different from each other.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|When I got this mouse the first most noticeable thing about it was how well it seemed to mold my hand. It was very comftorable and fit well on my hand size. Wether its playing video games, doing work or browsing the web, it still felt good even after hours of using it. The buttons are responsive, and has a cool customization settings, including a quick switch on DPI with dots displaying what level it is on. This mouse is definitely worth the price, and is overall a great mouse to have.<br /><br />I really liked the customer service too, I had a defective mouse, and anker customer service contacted me, and replaced it with a new mouse for free. Not only was it fast and easy but they were very nice, responsive and kind. This great product is only matched by its outstanding  company.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|I have always been into electronics and such like that as a kid so I grew up with this and the second movie so when Is saw them remastered on bluray I had to get them.
0307477479|1.0|This is the 3rd work of fiction in a row that I've read that employs this gimmick (to me it's definitely a gimmick) of skipping around through time (in this case various decades), characters, and short stories/chapters, leaving it to the reader to figure out how, where, when and mostly IF it will all come together in the end.  Frankly I have come to believe -especially after this book- that it's a way for an author to avoid having to come up with a real plot, a climax, and even serious character development. That surely sounds mean, but I found nothing redeeming in this book at all; I kept reading because I thought surely all this hopping around would become clear in the end, some sort of revelation if not a real event to bring the various chapters together somehow. Sure, the characters overlapped in SOME of the stories (yawn), but that was not enough to stop me from wanting more in the way of story/plot/connection - or at the very least some sort of meaning to the whole thing. I realize that the \\"official\\" reviews are glowing, but I sometimes wonder who writes them... certainly nobody who actually lived through the earlier decades in some of the chapters. Disappointed.
B005CM1INE|5.0|Classic Stephen king just cleaned up and upscaled for modern technology. You most likely know what this movie is and don't need to be reading reviews. Fantastic.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I love this book I  give it a five review because  it tells you to always stand strong in what you believe in
B008602KQI|5.0|Very good movie, great adaptation of the book ( book is still better but thats usually the case ) back story is well told and the action throughout is perfectly done.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I had got this becasue I blew my computer up at work and needed something to do while sitting there all day.  I got tired of reading so...cubistry it was.  I figured i would play this one or two times and be done with it.  I am not kidding when I say I sat and my desk and played this for hours! Shame on me, but it was lots of fun.
B009MO5ES8|5.0|I thought the movie was very well done, you want to punch the antagonist almost immediately with his awful laugh but I suppose that was part of the point. Fun to watch.
6304712499|5.0|I love this movie! Particularly because of Michael Jai White.  The quality of the movie and the extras because its the Director's made this purchase worthwhile.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|Was getting ready for ghost protocol to come out and got this trilogy on sale for a great price to complete the collection on bluray, what more could be asked for.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Classic Bob Marley.  The lyrics are prophetic. The music spiritually transforming.<br />Hard to listen to and not want to dance and sing along.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I had rev 1.1 of this board and am now running 3.0 which has UEFI which works a lot better with my SSD and RAID configuration than the standard BIOS on the older model. The two full x16 PCI-E lanes are great and can even be used with nVidia SLI if you don't want Radeon cards.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Love lindsey stirling. All of the songs on the album are amazing, it's a great to listen to at the gym.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This might be my second favorite MI movie. Number one is still the first but this one was great with the comedy they threw in, and the devices breaking down all the time on them. Added a sense of realism to them that was much needed with how seriously they were taking themselves before.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I read the first two books within a matter of weeks but got busy with school when I started reading the third so it was a slow prices and I had a hard time keeping interest until I got to the last quarter of the book. I finally had time to read again and blasted through it in a few days. Could not put it down. The trail was my favorite part and I wish there were more books to continue reading.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|It almost wouldn't matter what the movie was about as long as these two were acting together as they are just a fantastic pair, but the fact that it is Sherlock Holmes just makes it better. Well done movie, lots of action and tons of witty humor.
B00DSTRJKY|5.0|These dolls are just amazing. Very nicely made and good looking. Quality of material is superb, facial expression fantastic and dress is very appropriate.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Absolutely fantastic movie, you can tell they are Military and not actors but not in a bad way. It makes the movie way easier to get into and stay in. Must see.
B002RUA54W|4.0|arrived on time and well packaged.  I liked the book but was a little confused on motivation.  Very well written
B003VS0CYC|5.0|I love these movies ( well maybe the third less than the rest but hey can't just have two of the three ) finding them in a trilogy pack at a good price was just perfect
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is so goofy but is very unique.  I love watching this movie from time to time, and this dvd plays great.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|There is a reason it was a box office hit, besides the reconstruction of the titanic sets being AMAZING and incredibly accurate the story really wasn't bad either. Guys and Gals alike can sit and watch it and both enjoy it.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Awesome next step into the Bourne stories, and a very well done movie. The acting was great and so was the story.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I was excited to read this book as soon as I saw the preview for the movie. Unfortunately after reading the book I think that this may be one of the few times where the movie is better than the book...<br /><br />The book starts off good but then drags on and spends too much time on scenes that mean nothing to the overall story.<br /><br />By the end I just wanted to finish it and move on, I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: the ending is predictable but still bizarre.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Being from the Original Nintendo era watching this movie was exceptionally exciting for me seeing all the older games and characters. Great movie too, was super cute and very funny.
B00821OX98|5.0|One of my favorite shows on Amazon Prime can't stop watching with my wife. Good Quality depending of how fast is your internet speed on streaming
B000KIPT30|5.0|Purchased two of these, one for on stage headphones and one to actually use as a junction box to send the sound elsewhere in the building to other amps/speakers. Works in both environments very well, individual channel volume control is perfect. No hum/hiss from these units at all.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|The movie is exciting enough with plenty of plot twists. However, there are holes in the plot large enough to drive a truck through.<br /><br />The worst is the needless idea that there is some spray that will instantly eliminate radiation. I spent 16 years in the military, much of it working in Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical defense. There is no such spray. The reason I say this was not needed is the actors were wearing radiation suits. I am sure it was easier to express emotion without the suits but they had already worn protective suits through much of the movie.<br /><br />The second problem is the way most of the Russians speak English most of the time. It is fine when talking to the Americans but why would they speak English between themselves? It is not like they speak English all the time. They switch back and forth.<br /><br />Finally, Even the world's heaviest helicopter would not survive having its tail rotor slicing off parts of a stone wall.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Great movie with tons of one liners that will live generations on. Arnold is in fine form with this movie and is probably the best of the 3 original in my opinion.
B004AQR29C|4.0|Typical &#34;shoot-em-up&#34; but the star studded movie made it a little more interesting than most. How old is &#34;Sly&#34;??  Hard to believe he is still mixing it up.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I like it well enough to watch it again, do I call it a prequel to Alien? No, it isn't really worthy of that. Too many small details are off, but maybe those details will be answered in Prometheus 2. As a movie of it's own entity pretending I hadn't seen Alien,s,3, or even Resurrection then I would say it was a great movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|I suck at the game but it sure is fun to play. I first saw my 2 year old niece play this game and she was great at it. She is so much better than I am, but give me time.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I think this was Daniel Craig's best bond movie yet. Great action, perfect drama. No he is no Sean Connery but he does very well making the character his own while still following true to the original.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The game is very fun to play and so addictively delightful. Although I am not any good at hitting my target, it still so much fun.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|Not quite what I expected, little dark. Still very cute movie, but not one I would necessarily show super young kids. Could confuse them about a few things. I still liked it though and once I have warned my friends it's a bit different they seemed to like it as well.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|I have listened to the cd in my car and really enjoyed the later songs.  Some of the younger songs not so much
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Absolutely a great movie, the interplay between all of the characters throughout was both funny and completely enjoyable. The action scenes were great and the story lines were perfect. My only thing is Edward Norton wasn't playing The Hulk in this.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I thought they did a great job this was a lot better than some of the other remakes or creations of fairy tales.  GREAT Movie.. Action packed.
B003L16FAE|5.0|Great movie with some classic Arnold. Plenty of action, violence, swearing and blood. Did I mention Arnold? This is a great buy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game keeps your mind busy. each level is harder than the last. love it! I love how I have to keep thinking of new places key items are hid and remember codes. I was looking for a game to occupy my mind and I found the perfect one.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|If you don't like Fantasy movies and such like that then you probably won't like this movie, but if you do and are a fan of J.R.R. Tolken then you will probably love this movie. It does stray from the book some, but the story itself does flow very well and will be a great ...ending? Beginning? ( not sure where to place that here lol ) to the LOTR series.
0345803493|5.0|I read this second book in about three days, really good read :) Had to order the third one right away!
B001CT877Q|5.0|Certainly not the greatest movie out there but still fun to watch. When I saw it was released on bluray I jumped on it for a very good price
B006G4F8OW|5.0|My husband likes to watch that show and I figured part of my anniversary present would be this figurine. It is exceptionally made, the box looks super nice. Husband loved it and I was happy :)
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|Love these movies, and got a great deal. Comes in a nice tin if you are interested in that, and the bluray case inside holds all 3 discs separately.
0345803485|5.0|Yea...I was not expecting to like this book so much. I did, just ordered the third book :) :) I would recommend to get the trilogy at once and save money.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Good movie overall, bit of a slow start but it is a creative idea, and watching the old battleship go into action at the end with real navy crew was completely worth it all.
0399230033|5.0|It doesn't matter if you get this book in paperback or board book format, this is a must.  The illustrations are what makes this book a must-have on your nursery bookcase.  Kiddos love watching the progression of the animals throughout the story all the while hearing 'good night' over and and over.  It is an adorable book to share.
B007X4ECLY|5.0|I liked this movie over all. Pretty fresh idea, the CGI wasn't too bad over all ( some of it was but that was just in the beginning ) and it was well acted.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|The story of the beginning of the Roman Empire has been told many times, but for the visual story this HBO series was very well done.  There are a couple Hollywood hiccups, but overall it presents a stunning visual concept of the transition from late Republic to the beginning of empire.  The intrigues of and for power from the Julian house to the halls of Egypt are very well presented, and I would even consider using this DVD within a college Humanities or Ancient History course to give the students an idea of what it could have been like 2000 years ago.
B005LAII3U|5.0|I was pretty impressed with how they did this remake. It is definitely not the original but thats good too. They didn't try to MAKE it like the original, which would have been impossible, but they kept the feel of it pretty alive and got their own creative story in it. Well done.
B00000G42T|5.0|Thanks for great price, packaging and fast delivery. I love my cd, it is in great condition. This is the best buy I have made so far, Thank YOU.
B004HY3BTC|5.0|I have always been in to electronics and the like and I grew up watching this movie so when I saw it remastered on bluray  I just had to have it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a wonderful book if you enjoy 80s retro , online gaming, and futuristic settings.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down, and have recommended it to a number of my friends who all loved it.<br /><br />The movie rights have been sold, so hopefully a movie will come out soon!<br /><br />Great read
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|It was a good thriller over all, some of your typical 'Boo!' scare tactics, but it is to be expected. Does a good job at getting under your skin and the storyline was pretty interestingly thought out. I liked that there wasn't a huge amount of gore, yes there was blood and all but it wasn't how much blood and body parts can we throw across the screen at once. It was more in the style of older thrillers where they lead up to what is going to happen but don't actually show it, but through a reflection. Stuff like that.<br /><br />If you don't like horror or thriller movies then don't get it, you won't like it.
B0013SJH7A|3.0|Not her best. The characters were not very interesting or likable for the most part and that makes for a long read. Too wordy and therefore, hard to follow at times. The characters were also for the most part, one dimensional. Jane must have been feeling unwell while writing Persuasion because if I hadn't made a promise to myself that I would read all the Jane Austen books, I would have quit reading at the first chapter.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is not the world is that you listening for a lot more information and very few people went with a yummy day parade of Bailey's the most of Bailey's the most of life in on a lot more than the most of Bailey's and the time all rights and today we have been a yummy day for a lot more information about that you can sleep in on the world is a lot more than the most important t he is not the world is that the most of life for a yummy day parade in on a yummy day for a yummy and the world yesterday I was going to do it is a good idea to have a yummy and the world yesterday I was in my contacts to time and today I was a lot to time all rights to time and very affordable to outsource your project and the world yesterday I had to
B004GYY714|4.0|I enjoy the versatility and mobility of TuneIn Radio, with access to live streaming from literally hundreds of radio stations offering music, talk, news and lots more! The limiting factor is the connection speed and area coverage of WiFi, 4G or 3G network. The ads can also be annoying, but upgrade to TuneIn Pro should remove that nuisance. Overall, good value for money. Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I thought this was going to be like the 100 floors game but it turned out to b  way more fun. It's challenging but not impossible.
B002HFP0QU|3.0|the CD was great no problems there, but they do not stay in the cover. for whatever reason they just don't fit so they keep falling out of the CD case.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I always liked hidden object games. But this one is ok. A little slow and kind of easy to find the things. I like the story line and the far graphics a re nice too. I always buy g5 games
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Good and easy to use. Not hard on the eyes in the middle of the night. Like seeing the current temperature at any time.
B00307OTDE|5.0|I had this years ago and had lost it. I got the MP3 download and love it. Crisp sound and still the best licks ever laid down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's wriing and found this one to be true to form. Exciting, suspenseful and full of twists and turns. Another must read!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Hopefully the next game will be out soon because you can't stop playing, very addicting. We want more I can't believe it ended already mind bending and very good!
B00004SPYK|5.0|This is such a classic movie which I wanted for my collection. Love Richard Gere and who doesn't love Lauren Hutton.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I honestly cant believe i found that this game is nothing like i hoped to be. All it is that this game is actually super scribblenauts on an android device. And this game is a DS game. Meaning you get the same stuff... wait no, you cant get every world or skin in the Android device. You only get about 3 or 4 worlds to play in. WARNING: THIS IS NOT SCRIBBLENAUTS UNLIMITED!!!!!  On the DS the game has everything on it. Of course on the DS the skins cost ollars. Not dollars, Ollars or virtual money you get by beating levels. Long story short. Actual price isn't 1 dollar.
B0095P31L6|2.0|Animation OK.  Story goes a bit over-the-top especially with the Clint Eastwood bit.  Not the worst worst thing I ever watched. Very glad it came with package and I didn't actually pay to see it.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|Well written story line, well developed characters and action packed. A go to, feel good movie on a rainy day.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game is a lot of fun. However, I've noticed the higher the level I am, the more it freezes.  Sometimes I have to shut off my kindle and totally restart. It started to say the games data can't be found after I opened it and after it showed the loading bar, so I couldn't play it anymore. I had to uninstall it thus losing all my progress and having to start over.  I was at level 18. I still like it though and still think it was worth downloading. It was free so I didn't really loose anything.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|Excellent story line, love the entire series! Good acting, good writing, action packed with believable characters, and of course Matt Damon!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this series of books while searching for something different to read. This is why Amazon Kindle is so much better than the rest. I enjoyed the story of these silos immensely. I can't wait to start the next series of books. So far these books are written very well. I read the beginning stories so quickly. I've been up for two days reading.!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is amazing. I kept wanting to read this over and over again. I personally think that I would give this book to any person that likes crazy and cool.
B008Y1YFOE|4.0|L liked to ok.  production was good and the sound sufficient.. It just wasnt what i was looking for .Carl;
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this app it was challenging but not too hard that it can't be solved. I really wish there were more rooms already. Great game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room is a complex find it. It will test what you know. There are a lot of rifles and hidden items you have to find to proceed in the game.
B001N3HUP6|5.0|Looked for this DVD for a long time. Was told it was out of circulation checked best buy could not find I anywhere until I went to amazon
B007FEZQF8|3.0|I thought this book is amazing. I like it better then the show because it shows more characters and tells more of the story line. It was the best book so far that I've read. I think you should keep the show and comics going because your getting better and better each season. You should never doubt yourself. Keep continuing these comics.<br />  -zombielover
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|Still new to me. I'm still exploring. So far so good. Will rate it again later. Check back in a month.

B000FC1PNE|5.0|I've read Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series several times, and this is my favorite story of the series.  There's just something about Penelope and Collin that is so endearing.  **Spoiler Alert**.  My only complaint is I wish that Lady Whistledown wasn't \\"outed\\" so early in the series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it, definitly a must read ! I couldnt even put my tablet down , cant wait to get the next book
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|Always a favorite. A must purchase for those who have kids, grandkids or who are just young at heart! It's a keeper.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The cases were so interesting and clever and the cast of characters were excellent! The character drama is happening but not too much, I prefer the interesting cases. I hope it stays this way!
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Funny movie. Worth seeing. Stupid humor, but that was to be expected. Not sure I'll watch it over and over, but it was well worth seeing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest! I have found so many things on there! Between things to do with my son, for the new baby and around the house the pins have made my life much easier!!
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Always a favorite. A must purchase for those who have kids, grandkids or who are just young at heart! It's a keeper.
B00BEXB18M|1.0|I'm a fan of Megadeth, I own every studio album (except Risk, and the World Needs a Hero), so I have to say the song writing is terrible here (&#34;Burn Baby Burn&#34;). The production was bad. The riffs were repetitive. And no, I'm not hating on it because it's not thrashy, I liked Youthanasia a lot. This doesn't compare to their last four albums very well, I'm surprised they can go from 13 (which I actually enjoyed) to this. UPDATE: Luckily with Dystopia, Megadeth redeemed themselves. I guess this may have been the effect of burnout
B0060D0OKW|5.0|Always a favorite. A must purchase for those who have kids, grandkids or who are just young at heart! It's a keeper.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game for younger kids and will get your kid to stop begging for a horse temporarily very very fun.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|This was a great movie. I was worried that it might be a let down after the mission impossible movies, but I was mistaken. Lots of action, great special effects great stunts, great storyline.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great a bit slow to download but fun it would be great for all horse lovers of all ages!
B0060CREHO|5.0|Always a favorite. A must purchase for those who have kids, grandkids or who are just young at heart! It's a keeper.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|We really liked watching it as a whole family. We are very picky about movies we allow our kids to watch. they say \\"stupid\\" in it numerous times which is the thing we don't like about it but we talk to the kids about it and how that's not a kind way to talk. There is a couple scary parts but overall it's great.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Great movie, I love the quick humor. It was fast paced with a good storyline. I am glad I bought it.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|So I have liked Kanye for years, I actually first started liking him with Late Registration then went backwards to get College Dropout then bounced around getting other albums of his. The most interesting thing about him is his the way he constantly is changing his style up with changes he is going through in his personal life. We saw that with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. However I never have seen an album of his completely split people. We have the one side saying genius, or instant classic, or fantastic, than the other side saying garbage, trash, or \\"I would give this a 0 if I could\\". Personally I found it to be his most original work since his first album.<br /><br />First off, this new album is different don't expect the older more heavily sampled soulful Kanye, except for the final track Bound 2. Most of these songs are heavy on the bass and the dark almost horror core sounding rap. It is not horror core but it has influences from there, dark bass heavy beats, filters to change his voice to make his voice deeper, at times disgusting lyrics, and a mainstream audience just can't handle that. More hip hop heavy people can most likely see that attempt. However, the one thing you can always expect Kanye to do well is have good production on his tracks he is a better producer than he is a rapper.<br /><br />Second, in terms of Kanye's lyrics, yes they at times can be \\"juvenile\\" but that hasn't changed he has done that before and people have ate it up in the past. It goes well with the overall angry release this must be of an album for Kanye. He obviously is releasing inner frustrations, as we can hear with the angry screaming lyrics and dark heavy beats. That isn't to say the lyrics are fantastic at times. Black Skinhead, New Slaves, Blood on the Leaves, Bound 2, etc. All have great lyrics, ranging from dark commentary to witty punchlines.<br /><br />Finally, people have to recognize it is a different Kanye, but most seem unwilling or not up for this change. I am one on the the accepting side, and maybe its because I have listened to more Hip Hop but who knows. Give it a try though and it might surprise you. When you first hear it you might be split how to feel, all I am saying no matter how much I hated an album it is not worth less than 0.am one on the the accepting side, and maybe its because I have listened to more Hip Hop but who knows. Give it a try though and it might surprise you. When you first hear it you might be split how to feel, all I am saying no matter how much I hated an album it is not worth less than 0.

1400067820|2.0|He's a clever guy, and the basic idea is sound, and relatively unexplored in literature, but he's becoming something of a bore. The reader is forced to endure a number of rants, including discussions of his anger about orange juice, \\"modern\\" apples, exercise routines, the lack of fasting in modern diets, all economists, anyone who does not hold his opinion, sunscreen, and a bizarre collection of other topics. Imagine Andy Rooney if he had been twice as angry, a pit trader on Wall Street, and unwilling to listen to an editor. Speaking of which, this book calls out for an even tempered editor, who could preserve all the good ideas, and cut the page number in half. Given the author's distaste for editors (another of his many targets), it will never happen, which is too bad. His anger and self importance are upstaging his good ideas. Tedious...tedious...tedious...and too bad, because there's something here.
B004LPLU4K|5.0|I remember this story being read to me as a little girl and this movie is the best one that comes close to the book. Have watched it many times and it never gets old.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|If you like idiotic inaccurate historical portrayals with a focus on slimy and ignorant politicians from both sides then Lincoln is for you. It is amazing how they made Lincoln to look and suck as much as our modern politicians. This is NOT entertainment and is a bad movie. As far as good directors are concerned, Spielberg was great in the PAST. Considering the latest Spielberg effort as chipped paint, no shine, Spielberg is no longer a great director. I feel Spielberg owes me $3.99 for not living up to his name.
006178480X|3.0|Not sure what it was about this one but I didn't like it as much as the Sigma books in the past.  I was excited to get it.  I preordered so it would be loaded on my Kindle.  I started reading it just as soon as I got it.  But, just wasn't spell-bound as usual.  Maybe I didn't like the expansion of other characters.  I felt like they distracted me from the core group.  I wanted more Pierce, Monk, Kat, Painter.  Not sure I'm thrilled with the pairing that came out of this at the end.  Still a good read.  I will definitely be waiting for the next one.  But, can't see myself re-reading this one.  If it wasn't an ebook, I'd probably sell it.  If I was recommending this series, I wouldn't have them start with this book.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|OK, maybe I'm just super-uncoordinated or something, but I found if I lasted for more than 30 seconds playing this game, it was a miracle.  There is so much going on that having your finger on the screen really blocks a lot of your view so you get hit from behind or the sides a lot.  The game usually is over so fast that I don't have a chance to enjoy it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is a very fun app for any age the graphics are good the game is easy to under stand yet some times it kill your person when you aren't even pushing the gas but that is a minor mistake and who knows it could be my bad driving:)
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My autistic nephew loves this movie and will constantly ask me 'where's JoJo?'  He loves the animation, music, and for some reason likes the scene where there are 'judges' sitting around.  This is a great movie for him and keeps him laughing.  It is very hard to find movies that will, and do entertain, a child with autism.  Horton Hears a Who fits that bill.
B008KE3960|5.0|my whole family loves this game...I will warn you it is a bit of an addiction once you start LOL.  You fly planes and shoot tanks...you cant get a much better game for a 6 year old boy who is crazy for anything military :)
B00992CF6W|3.0|its a great game really the only resin I put 3 stars is becouse it expinsive and adicting! I got this app for free on Apk.com go on youtube and I'm sure it can tell you how!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|The game was awesome on my kindle fire HD. The graphics was excellent. Would play this game over and over.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This item has been on my wish list for awhile, but, being on a tight budget, I have yet to purchase it. (That will be rectified within days!) I've seen several versions of this classic (not all by any means), and I've read the book multiple times. Up until now, I have to say that my favorite production has been the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version. It is absolutely true to the book. Even the dialogue of that version goes verbatim to the book much of the time. But, in all honesty, I have to say that after recording this version on my DVR this weekend, it's become my clear favorite. While there are minor deviations from the book, the heart of the story still remains intact. And the minor deviations do give this version a fresher approach. What I most love about this version is the passion displayed between Jane and Rochester. Hollywood could certainly take some pointers here. There are no inappropriate scenes, there is no R-rated material, but it is certainly not lacking in passion. The scenes in the flashbacks of Jane and Rochester that precede her leaving after the failed wedding are steamy, yet tasteful. And who among us hasn't thought that such passion would have indeed been a part of their relationship? Both Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens (he is gorgeous) were well suited to their respective roles, and played them to the hilt. I especially like his somewhat dry wit, and the banter that the two exchange at times.<br />As far as any negatives, since I've only seen this broadcast on Ovation I can't be sure if there is any material deleted. However, basing my comments on what I've seen, the only real negative comments I can make about this version are  1) The part of the story that centers around St. John and his sisters is much less detailed than in the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version. That's not necessarily a negative, but it is much more condensed in this version.<br />2) If one hasn't read the book or is otherwise familiar with the story, there may be somequestions about Rochester's injuries toward the end. There is only a brief description of what happened at Thornfield, and no explanation or scenes depicting how he sustained his injuries. It is, therefore, to be assumed I suppose by anyone who may not already be familiar with the details. This version also leaves the impression that he remains blind. That was somewhat disappointing.<br />In this reveiwer's humble opinion, the pros far outnumber the cons for this version. On a final note, another huge plus for this version is the grandeur of the scenery and the beautiful, sometimes haunting musical score. Of course, one would expect both from Masterpiece Theatre and the BBC. As always, they delivered with full force on this excellently done timeless classic.<br />Addendum:<br />As I mentioned in my initial review, I had, at that time, only seen this on Ovation. I ordered the DVD, and have now watched it. As I suspected, there were some scenes deleted from the Ovation production as there almost always is on network TV in order to fit alloted time slots. The scenes that were deleted, however, while adding to the overall feel and grandeur of the production, were not critical to the storyline. But I feel the need to add a little to my review now that I have seen the DVD. While I still love this version and am most happy to have it as a part of my video collection, I do feel that it is lacking in some minor details that, for me, would have enhanced the production. I will preface this by stating that I am very much a 'detail person.' For me, I prefer to know the how and why and when of events and not to be left assuming. If you are not a detail person, then these things probably don't matter to you.<br />1)After the fire in Rochester's bedroom where the wonderful romantic scene takes place he wraps his robe around her and tells her '..we agreed you'd never be cold again.' Okay, when did that conversation take place? 2)There is a scene which takes place the morning following the fire when Jane learnes that he has left to attend a house party. When Mrs. Fairfax comes to the table, Jane appears to have in her hand either a necklace or some memento, which she quickly puts in her pocket as if she doesn't wish Mrs. Fairfax to see it. What is it? And what are the details regarding it? 3)After the scream in the night when all the guests are alarmed and gather in the hall Rochester speaks to them, calming their fears, and then tells them to go back to bed. We see Jane wipe up the blood that dripped from his injured hand (we are not told how that happened) and then we see her waiting fully dressed in her bedroom. At his knock on the door, she answers 'I'm ready.' He obviously conveyed to her that he wished her assistance. But that is omitted. 4)Toward the end when Jane returns to Thornfield, the details are very sketchy as to what happened to Rochester regarding the fire. Nothing is mentioned of his injuries. Jane obviously doesn't even know he's blind until she sees him some distance away outside Ferndean. At no time is it mentioned that he can see at least a little. Yet during the scene at the end when she sits in his lap with her face very close to his, she asked, \\"Can you see me?\\" and he nods in the affirmative.<br />Now, having read the book and seen other versions of the story on film, I know most of these details. But I'm sure there are some who have not read the book and are not familiar with the story at all. For me, if that were the case, there would be some unanswered questions regarding these details I've mentioned.<br />Those, for me, are the negative aspects of this production. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version, which is so detailed. Having stated all this, I do still love this version. I like the fact that Rochester seems to have a fondness for Adele, even though he says he doesn't like children. It is also obvious in this version that he does not care for either Blanche or her snobbish family and attitudes. He never states in this version that he offered his attentions to her in order to make Jane as madly in love with him as he was with her, which he does state in the book.<br />Rochester is a wounded soul. The sadness definitely comes through. He comes across as a complex character; gentlemanly and refined, displaying at times a somewhat dry wit. Yet at other times one can see the intense sadness that masks his face.<br />My initial rating of this production still stands. I love it in spite of the omissions, although I would very much have liked for those things I've mentioned to have been addressed.<br />If someone out there is not familiar with the story and this is the first version you are to view, I would suggest you familiarize yourself somewhat with the overall aspects of the story, especially regarding Rochester's injuries and how they were sustained at the end.
B0097C8XL0|1.0|this looks like fun but believe me it isn't.  it looks like the game called temple run which sucks alot.  never heard of temple run eh?  well i'll give you a head start.  temple run is this game where you get chased by evil monkeys and you have to swipe down to get down and swipe up to jump and swipe left to go left and swipe right to go right, ok?  i'm not gonna tell you anymore.  that was just basically a head start to get you knowing on what it is about.
B00969PR18|5.0|This app is awesome everything is cool except the speed but my kindle is slow and you can't use it offline which kind of stinks but other wise this app rocks
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Muy buena pelicula para tener en esta calidad. Se recomienda totalmente, para que la tengan en sus colecciones, ademas de un precio razonable.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|X-Men The Last Stand is a great third movie of the series and truly mind blowing special effects that made my mouth drop down.  Me personally savored the movie and the plotline and both the bad guys and good guys mutant wise, some people bad mouth this movie because of the plotline but I saw potential in it.  No matter what it lived up to all the hype from people telling me about the movie, and for 5 dollars well worth every dollar I spent on it.  If you need a great action movie made good in honor of the comic book series then pick up this movie and savor the mind blowing special effects and amazing fight scenes by the mutants fighting for what they feel right path, and how far you will go to save the person you love with all your heart (spoiler)talking of course about Wolverine and Jean Gray.  As for the special effects I found what they did with the San Fransico Bridge amazing work by the people who made it all possible.  In closing I look forward to the Wolverine movie this July, and X-Men 4 movie in 2014 or 2015 depending on shooting the movie.
B005ZMUXDC|3.0|I don't know why, but I splurged on a cheap used copy of the DVD for this film, and where I had a good time watching it in the theatre, I found myself wondering why I bought the DVD.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's an entertaining film for what it is, and I'm glad I went and saw it, but something kept nagging at me about this movie.  And it still nags at me.<br /><br />Was it the message to young girls?  I think partly.  In order for Rapunzel to be \\"normal\\" person she has to lose part of her beauty?  I think you can be both, and not have to chance your physical appearance to do so.  I think if Rapunzel had been artificially been made into some golden haired enchantress, and all the negative overtones flowing from that were shown, then this would have been a better film.  But, as it stands now, Rapunzel needed to mutilate herself in order to be with her family, as well as lose her magical gift, which was only shown to work once or twice in the film in the first place.  That bothers me.  But, then again, maybe I'm over-thinking it.<br /><br />The bright point for this film is the humor.  Unlike some of Disney's other offerings the humor in this film makes sense.  It's a little cliche here and there, but it makes people laugh and is harmless, albeit somewhat silly.<br /><br />All in all it's a decent watch.  I have no idea why I bought a copy as I really don't have any great liking for this film, but I guess the price was right.<br /><br />Check it out.
B0084670FU|3.0|A little confusing to see how it all relates together, but entertaining to watch. Not my favorite Brad Pitt flick
B0012Q732O|2.0|Clean actors, clean environment, perfect English speaking characters, overbloated CGI, what's not to like?  All of it.<br /><br />If you're going to make a movie about pre-historic times, why on Earth would you make the dumbest possible movie ever?  Would you not want to make something that's both good and accurate that everyone can enjoy?<br /><br />Instead we get mister pop-paranoia-psychology himself making what has got to be one of the worst movies in the Pre-historic genre regarding a very clean looking \\"caveman\\" who is confronted with a movie director's vision of the challenges of living with primitive technology.<br /><br />This thing could have been so much better, just like another reviewer stated, but it wasn't.  And what's worse is that people flocked to this film, and continue to flock to it.  Me, I bought a cheapo $3 used DVD of thing to remind myself what I was missing.  And ho-boy, did it deliver.  So much that I may just donate the disk.<br /><br />See it once, if you must.<br /><br />But I'd skip it altogether.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|My grandson says this game is totally cool, He says the game is a lot of fun and has much more variety in the graphics and the power-ups than does Temple Run.  He dislikes that this game has one big gorilla chasing after you rather than hundreds of them.  He also says the game speeds up earlier as you gain meters compared to Temple Run, and this speed-up occurs too soon with Temple Run 2 in his opinion. He would recommend this game to anyone who does not have it currently.
B005JABU82|5.0|Great package and shipping for dealer.<br /><br />And for product, everything is all right, but I should remind you that if u are a starter, an rg is not the best choice, since the components are small and the number of water pastes will drive u tired.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Compared to other games, my grandson says this one is super awesome and he loves it.  He does nor like the trains coming at you instead of behind you. He would like to see a mega coin like in Temple Run. Even with the couple of shortcomings mentioned, he would recommend this product to all of his friends.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Lincoln was not the perfect person we tend to make of him and this portrayal looks at a small portion of his life and the political wrangling he had to do to get the Anti-Slavery amendment passed. It kept us all interested throughout the entire movie.

B003V9OCIS|5.0|I would like to watch it again, because I had to read the subtitles, I think that took a little away from the overall movie.<br />The acting was superb! All of the climbing scenes were heart wrenching.  The ending was truly sad.  I didn't realize it was based on a true story until after I watched it.  I highly recommend this movie if you are in for suspense!

B00908DDZM|5.0|I really do not like rap music, but after hearing &#34;Thrift Shop&#34;, and seeing the Tiny Concert Performance on NPR, I decided to give this album a listen, and I was not disappointed.  Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are two great performers and writers! I love all the songs! And &#34;Same Love is great&#34;! But, my favorite of the whole album is &#34;White Walls&#34;-a song about his love affair with his Cadillac.  LOVE it!  GO now and buy The Heist! You will not be disappointed! This is coming from a Zepellin fanatic, white, Midwestern girl! :)

0765325950|5.0|This book is (in my opinion, of course) one of the best fantasy books ever written. That applies to the Wheel of Time series as a whole, but to this book in particular. The whole series builds up to the Last Battle, which, if the preceding books are any indication, should be a dramatic event of epic proportions. And that is exactly what this book delivers. Brandon Sanderson has done a great job of finishing the work that Robert Jordan started. Besides managing to write an epic end to an epic series, I also commend him for his attention to detail. One example of that is that he actually ties up loose ends in the story that I had forgotten existed. I had been looking forward to the last book in the series for a long time, and when it finally came, it delivered everything I was hoping for and much more. Highly recommended.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Awesome song. I hope Pharnell gets an award for it. His work on this soundtrack and that of the first movie is exceptional.

B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I would have loved it if Matthew had not been killed. Or if they would have arranged his death differently.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Okay! Overall great ending to the 13 book series (should have been a 8 - 10 book series)! There was a lot of action, battles, surprises,etc. what I really liked was there as just enough closure. Most things get tied up and you can at least assume what will happen in the future. That was a nice way to handle it.<br /><br />What I didn't like was the fact that because of &#34;Jordan&#34; there were SO many loose threads to tie up that the book didn't always flow very well. It jumped around a lot and some of the battle scenes were way to drawn out. In fact a lot of them I could have done without. Also, wish Matt and Tuon had more closure/exposure in this finale. There was so much built up with them that this ending didn't do them justice!<br /><br />Overall. A really good ending. Honestly Sanderson saved this series completely. Without the last three books overall, this would have been a huge bust. I plan on reading more of his books.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A good game on Amazon! Graphics are very colorful and vibrant. I enjoy playing this game on my Kindle Fire HD, and that makes it soooo easy to lose track of time. There are challenging and more difficult levels of play.

0439023513|4.0|The first two books were awesome, but this one was just okay. I remember thinking this could have ended long ago, but it just kept going. & I was disappointed in how the book ended. I just assumed w/it being the end of the series, the ending would be better. I was a little more than slightly disappointed.
B00CTIHCHU|5.0|Well done, the HD version is worth it. It lets the color palate and texture of the wardrobe come through perfectly.<br /><br />Series itself is excellent, but some of the monster of the week style episodes detracts from the main story arch a bit. Nothing that ruins the show, but does leaves you wanting for more.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This is a very detailed description of all types of strengths.  I could not believe the nuances these researchers caught when creating this excellent inventory.  Just be aware that each book has just one code, so only one reader can take the complete online quiz to determine their strengths.  Additional codes/books are needed for each person being tested.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|In my personal opinion, reviewing a movie is difficult,<br />Why, because I can enjoy something that maybe you will not.<br />If you are a R William  fan, you should see this movie.<br />You like drama, you should see this movie.<br />I  have seen this movie four times, since it shows.

B00932HEX2|5.0|`Homeland' (pilot episode) features the journey of character Carrie Mathison having to carefully find out if the character of Nicholas Brody, a former marine, is an undercover Al Qaeda operative.  The characters of David Estes and Saul Berenson heavily factor into Carrie's professional life. The interesting part of this episode is that this must all be done without Brody knowing (due to legal redtape). \\"Homeland\\" (pilot episode) is good for those who like political thrillers set in the Washington D.C. area.

0399162097|4.0|When I finished reading Karen Joy Fowler's novel, We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, I was reminded of something a friend called to my attention decades ago. She said that one of the most important questions we have to answer is that when we say \\"we,' who do we mean? Fowler refers to \\"we\\" in a manner that may surprise readers. The family life of protagonist Rosemary Cooke fell apart starting at age five when her sister, Fern, was suddenly removed from the household. Rosemary didn't know family life without Fern, and the loss was devastating for Rosemary and for her brother, Lowell. The surprising element of this novel is that Fern is a chimpanzee. Fowler injects both wit and sadness to this story, constantly reinforcing how closely related humans and chimps are, leading readers to suspend any disbelief about how a family could include a chimp in close family life. Her writing engaged me throughout the novel, and the question for all readers will likely be: \\"when you say `we', who do you mean? After all, \\"we\\" are all creatures, aren't we?<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)

0062255657|4.0|Reading can take us to places that are both familiar and very different. In Neil Gaiman's capable hands, readers of his novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, leap into a setting that blurs reality and appearance, and to a plot that's wildly imaginative and close to anyone's coming of age experience. The narrator returns at age forty to the home where magical things happened to him at age seven. We learn through his recollections of the way he was protected by some unusual neighbors who guarded him from danger. The pond at the end of the lane was somehow also an ocean, and the guardian was more than a neighbor. The mythic themes will delight close readers, and the well-told story will engage all readers in the joy of a sad and poignant tale. I read the novel quickly, and enjoyed in from beginning to end.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B0045ODPKY|5.0|This was a birthday present, and it not only arrived in good time, it was in excellent condition as well.  The person who received the gift loved the movie, of course, and loved the DVD just as much.
0765357151|2.0|When began reading this book I can't really say I enjoyed it. As I continued reading the book, I can't really say I started enjoying. Not until I got about 70% of the way through the book did I actually begin finding the book enjoyable.  I came across a few continuity issues that irked me and really, I just did not like the character of Robert Neville very much.<br /><br />The TL;DR:<br /><br />The book is quite different from the movie and has its moments. In some ways good, in other ways bad. The reader in me that loves character growth and progression was quite disappointed. Overall I found the character of Robert Neville to be incredibly flat and found that he contradicted himself on several occasions. I've had a few friends tell me I'm batty and that the book was great, but hey, I like what like, and I didn't like this.<br /><br />Overall, I honestly would not recommend this book.<br /><br />The Bad (facts)<br /><br />1. Neville contradicts himself very frequently and I can't stand that. At the very beginning of the book (as in page 1) we establish that he is hung up on telling what time of day it is by the position of the sun in the sky, and not a watch. Because of this he never wanders far from his house on a cloudy day. A few chapters later Neville finds himself outside near dusk because he forgot to wind his watch on a cloudy day. In the case of literature, double negatives do not result in a positive. (I suppose I could let this one slide due to the overall situation his character is in, but I have a really hard doing so because I flat out do not like Robert Neville for the first 2/3rds of the book).<br /><br />Another example would be the fact that the book clearly states that wooden stakes are the only kind of stakes that will successfully kill a vampire, metal stakes don't work. At the start of the book we are unsure why, but by the end of the book we know why.  And once we know why, it becomes pretty clear that metal stakes WOULD work.<br /><br />2. Nevilles character does not change, grow, or learn for the first 2/3rd's of the book. Literally for 70% of the book his character subsists on two major characteristics. One he is horribly depressed and struggles with feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. Two he is a raging alcoholic. That's his character for majority of the book. His day to day life is filled self hate and drinking. I understand the guy is going through some tough stuff, but for a character to experience zero growth or change for the majority  of a book is pretty much unforgivable to me.<br /><br />The Bad (Opinions)<br /><br />1. I just really truly deeply do not like Robert Neville as a character.<br /><br />2. When he explains why bullets don't have any real effects on vampires my bs alarm went off. I won't go into details, but with the things he reveals later in the book, shooting a vampire with a shotgun at close range, or in the head at pretty much any range would result in vampiric death.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />1. After about 70% of the book Neville actually experiences some change, and his character actually becomes interesting and dynamic. We see him struggle with trust, with love, with companionship. We see him struggle with something that isn't a whiskey bottle or his own self loathing and it is astoundingly refreshing as well as engaging.<br /><br />2. The story is believable. I don't mean that in the sense that this could happen (which I really suppose it could) but I mean it more so in the sense that nothing so insanely outrageous occurs that I have to suspend all belief to get through it. Think of it as the difference between a movie being believable and a documentary being realistic.<br /><br />3. The ending, no spoilers obviously. But the last line of the book is pretty clever.<br /><br />The Meh :<br /><br />1. The whole book to me was pretty meh. I really did enjoy the last third of it, but first chunk of it really killed it for me.<br /><br />Story Synopsis :<br /><br />Throughout this story we Follow Robert Neville and his struggles with solitude and his inner demons. Robert is what he believes to be the only living man left on the face of the Earth after a horrible plague destroys the world's population, turning them all into ravenous vampiric beasts. He spends a great deal of time hating himself for various failings and being generally depressed. After kicking his depression and alcohol issues he dedicates himself to understanding the plague and why it behaves in the way it does. Then everything in Robert's life changes when he finds another human alive, but are the changes good or bad?<br /><br />Want to read more book reviews I've written?

B004H4XL7E|5.0|The best advice I can give is this book is not for beginners even though its exactly who should read it. My suggestion is to read this - find the frame that frustrates you the least when facing it and pick easiest tactic to Clift it - master that. Then move to next one. Pitch your family on a vacation. Your wife on that new car or grill. Your husband on a vacation. Pitch the ones you love the most and get great that. This books applies to your kids - your marriage - anything that's important to you.  Five stars all the way.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Running on a Kindle, Galaxy 3, and a HP PowerBook.  As for the synchronise operation,, personally I do not know of any application that works better.  If your devices are on, they will be updated before you can switch to the other device; and if it is not on, it will be updated upon power up.<br /><br />The organization of notebooks on a shelf and pages in a notebook is a familiar context to anyone over the age of twelve.<br /><br />However, as in most things, all is not rosy.  Getting into and around the program is clunky  and burns efficiency. A short primer on the operation with a few quick tips from experience would give the new user a much smaller hill to climb<br /><br />The reason for the four stars is a personal gut feeling on the potential future that this application has.<br />From an engineering point of view.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I enjoyed this game, but I will say that the map leading you to areas to take action was difficult to follow. It had no labling of areas,so it was hard to know if you were going in the right direction. I have also seen better graphics.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is so awesome and such a challenge! loving the game and enjoying being challenged mentally cant wait for all the levels to be available!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like this app. It's fun. However I have had problems..... I had to reset the app and download a new account because it wouldn't let me access it. But over all a fun app.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely loved this series!  The story was absolutely gripping!  The characters were believable and the villians were easy to hate.  I cant wait to read the next trilogy.  Definately read this series!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolute page turner! Loved how I was constantly having bombs dropped and didn't know what shocking revolation I was going to find out next. And to top things off, the developing love story between Holder and Sky(Hope) was so sweet.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Ordered all seven seasons for my husband.  Got each one off Amazon for under $15 which was a great buy!  He likes watching the story about the Winchester brothers.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Heard an interview with Macklemore and Lewis on NPR, and based on that I got the album.<br /><br />I am glad I wasn't disappointed. This album is a nice mix of catchy, feel good tunes, (Castle, Thrift Shop) to more serious, reflective, thought provoking gems (Wing$, Starting Over, Same Love), as well as some time traveling to simpler times (My Oh My, Wing$) of youth.<br /><br />Macklemore has a wide range of delivery styles, straight rapping, sing-rapping, and straight singing. The beats provide a catchy groove and rhythm, the orchestration and production are tight and the featured artists never detract or overpower songs.<br /><br />So get out your ski-mask and get your Heist on.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Ordered this DVD for my husband.  He likes this series.  It was a great value!  He has all seven seasons.
B00APKIN1I|3.0|A great complement to the documentary of the same name, it provides some follow up to what is recorded in the doc. This CD is loaded with musical all-stars brought together in communion with Dave Grohl and as a result Grohl appears on every track in some form or another.<br /><br />It's pretty much a mix of Foo Fighters and classic rock, which is good, but might not be what you're into.<br /><br />Best two tracks:<br />&#34;The Man That Never Was&#34;, a Rick Springfield collaboration (yes, the Jesse's Girl singer) has in my opinion one of the best tracks on the disc, if he would've done more stuff in this vein in the '80s people would think of him different.<br /><br />&#34;Mantra&#34;, the &#34;electronic jam with Grohl, Joshua Homme, and Trent Reznor, just incredible!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great tv series!  Have used amazon live streaming to watch the series free using Amazon prime!  Love it!  Easy to stream in on an iPad tablet using the amazon player.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Okay, I admit that I really enjoyed this book a lot. It was a fun read. It isn't great literature, however.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Got all 7 seasons for my husband and he likes them.  Great price for the DVDs!  All the seasons cost under $15 each.  He likes the story about the Winchester brothers.
B00271HAK8|5.0|I own it on VHS.  It's a classic of the 1980s, a time in America now gone forever.  I always have thought a sequel should be made at a time when Ferris has children of his own.  It would be a tragedy.  See this one.  It will pick you up!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for horse lovers and good graphics fun to play and for free its one of the best games ever

B005KR6NS6|5.0|A movie about the making of itself -- done in at least 4 languages but such that one never feels left out of the story because one can understand everything from the situations and visuals. Tango along the Seine in Paris. France. Europe.

B0091THRCU|4.0|Had purchased a plain plastic cover that did not provide any where near the protection that this one does.  Very happy with it.
B002MGGM9I|5.0|This movie is beautiful, dark, and full of paradoxes.  Every time I watch it,  I love it.  Strong themes throughout, the meaning of life, nature of relationships, nature of reality, religion and skepticism combined.  Worth watching.
1401940676|5.0|This CD was very informative offering first hand the journey from cancer to healing.  I felt her fears and her longings.  I also saw a tremendous amount of courage and openness to accept her healing in whatever form it took given the information she had at the time.  I saw the long journey it took for her to develop self love.
B005H9B2CE|1.0|This has to be the worst superhero movie I have ever seen.  I am so surprised how many people like it.  The acting was horrible.  The plot line was pretty lame.  It is like transformers 3, if Optimus Prime was a hammer.  Even if someone paid you to take the DVD, then you should take the opportunity to use it as a Frisbee or to find out what happens when you microwave a DVD.  Seriously, it is about as useful as an AOL CD.
030758836X|2.0|I was bored during the first few chapters thinking great another boring murder mystery.  I was pleasantly surprised by the middle of the book with the variety of twists and turns that the book took that were very unexpected.  I honestly could not put it down for the majority of the middle and the end. I was really rooting for the 'bad guy to get his or her comeuppance.' I was then totally let down by the true ending of the book. No one gets their just reward. The last few chapters really didn't even need to be included if this was the ending that the author was going to utilize. The book had so much potential I was truly disappointed with the ending.  Sorry the review is so vague, but I don't want to ruin the twists and turns.
1451695195|1.0|Dr. Alexander is supposedly a physician, to help others. He constantly uses his credentials as a basis for credibility. But he's apparently turned into a huckster and con man.<br /><br />What Dr. Alexander relates seems either a dream that he had, or a made-up lie. There is no way to tell for sure. Only he knows. Or maybe he is one of those who repeats a lie often enough that he comes to believe it. But in any case (dream, lie, or authentic NDE), what he relates is not \\"Proof of Heaven\\", or really proof (or evidence) of anything, because there is no way to confirm or replicate anything.<br /><br />Since he can't show this was not a dream, or even show that it's not something he just made up, his portrayal of his experience as signifying something earth-changing strikes me as dishonest, as an over-reach, and as fraud. He has set up a \\"non-profit\\" that will certainly line his pockets with lots of money. He has sold many books. My guess is Dr. Alexander is laughing all the way to the bank. This hearkens back to the olden days of the snake-oil salesman.<br /><br />The real mystery is how Dr. Alexander contracted E. coli meningitis. If he had real interest in medicine and science, not just making money, that's what he would investigate.<br /><br />The business about the butterfly is so bizarre, so out of touch with any other religion or belief. It beggars imagination how anyone could believe that this is anything other than a dream, or a made-up story.<br /><br />Of course, it's possible he had a genuine NDE, and that he has made an earth-changing discovery. But given the vagueness of what he relates, the great and obvious likelihood it was a dream, the known tendency of people to lie and make up stories, the impossibility of verifying his story, and the past ethical problems of the doctor, I think he is just preying on the gullible. Maybe they want to be preyed on, they put up with nonsense from many quarters. But this is not science, and does not qualify for \\"non-fiction\\" in my opinion. When people read Harry Potter, they know it's just a story, a fiction.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this is an awesome and challenging  game! I can not do the boss level.  hints did not help very much. love drawing the stickman!! works great on kindle fire.
B0086213XW|3.0|I almost stopped watching the film 15 times because I hate stories about middle class hipsters with First World problems. However, I am quite fond of Sarah Polly and her work so I continued to watch the entire film. The positives = the beautiful production design, location shoots of Toronto in the Summer and the feel of the film. I was intrigued by the characters surroundings and where they would go next. I loved the outdoor shots as well as the indoor sets. Great work there. I also loved the acting by Silverman and Rogan, so subtle and deep at the same time. I also liked the overall commentary on marriage and the issues that arise after a long relationship. The negatives = the overall plot is really thin, boring and kind of dull. There are no plot twists and the beginning is much like the end. In the middle, not much happens. I kept waiting for some big life event to happen, but nothing did. In the end, I didn't much care what happened to any of these almost 30-something characters. I did look forward to seeing Silverman who has maturity and intelligence, and can carry such an empty storyline. If you want to watch a lot of Michelle Williams with ennui (was she depressed? still don't know.) and interesting Toronto scenery, this film is for you. If not, I would skip it.
B0081SKYDG|1.0|I'm actually offended that Amazon would recommend this movie to me. :P It was garbage, waste of money, and a waste of my time.
B008GGA5EQ|4.0|It is safe to say that nobody writes erotica like Chloe Thurlow. I wish that I could!<br /><br />This story is so far-fetched that it could not possibly be true: not one part of it. It is pure fantasy. And that is what it is meant to be. It is superb erotic fiction. I am convinced that it contains many of the deepest fantasies of the author herself. If you read some of her other books, you may come to a similar conclusion. Whether that is true or not, and I like to think that it is, this makes for some damned good, and hot, reading.<br /><br />Imagine that you are an office girl, or boy, and that you find the freedom to lie, naked, on a beach on La Gomera, the remotest of the Canary Islands. You see a small island in the distance that you have never noticed before. You swim, free and naked, over to the island and start to explore. This is when your freedom comes to an abrupt end.<br /><br />You are captured, humiliated and abused. But, to your surprise, you find that you enjoy it. In fact, you do much more than enjoy it!<br /><br />This is exactly what happens to the heroine of this book. She is beaten, whipped, sodomised, screwed, forced into oral sex, tied up, treated as a slave, transported to, well, many unexpected places. The Arab pirates, and particularly the sheik whose slave she becomes, Shamir, bring her sexual excitement and thrills beyond her wildest dreams. Her juices flow continuously, and her climaxes cum across page after orgasmic page.<br /><br />She often wonders how she came to this new life from her completely contra-life as a London PR agent. Actually, the number of times that she wonders this began to grate on me a little. Perhaps she should just stop wondering and get on with her new, wonderful, incredibly horny, life.<br /><br />It gets even better when she ends up in a Saharan village, and becomes friends, and a little more, with the beautiful belly-dancer, Maysoon. She learns the art of sensual, erotic dancing for herself, and a lot more besides. Sex with her \\"sister\\" is unexpectedly arousing for her, and for this reader too!<br /><br />Well done to Chloe Thurlow, a true leader of the genre.

0321811984|5.0|There are already many great reviews of this book on amazon, so it is unlikely that I can say anything fresh about the content and style of this superb book, so I am not about to try. I'll just tell you a little story of how it helped me at a most opportune time.<br /><br />I have been presenting and instructing for well over three decades, and I am still learning something new every day. We should all be open to that and never believe that we hae actually arrived at the perfect state. Strive for perfection.<br /><br />I got a lot out of this book. I read it on a plane from England to my company HQ in Florida. I was due to co-deliver a two-week induction class for new joiner technical staff from all over the world. As you can imagine, we had put a lot of effort into the planning and preparation for the ten days of intense instruction.<br /><br />Despite the experience of the new people, I have always felt that everyone could do with a few tips and hints on good communication, public speaking and, in particular, delivering powerful presentations and demonstrations to our customers. So I had two hours dedicated to these topics.<br /><br />I mostly knew what I was going to do with the two hours, but reading<br /><br />Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery inspired me to change my content and delivery.<br /><br />I was able to use the three main guiding principles of the book: restraint, simplicity and naturalness , to construct a session to illustrate the power of those three guiding principles to the participants on my course.<br /><br />I went analogue! I minimalised! I told my story!<br /><br />This book really helped me to do that.<br /><br />Was I rewarded?<br /><br />Yes, I was.<br /><br />At the end of the course, all of the participants were assessed on a presentation and demo which they had to prepare during the two weeks. My presentation on good communication came on day one, shortly followed by the assigning of course assignments.<br /><br />All of my students used the guiding principles of Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery to great effect. It was a joy to watch!<br /><br />Thank you very much Garr Reynolds..<br /><br />All of my students used the guiding principles of Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery to great effect.

0316228532|3.0|I didn't read the Harry Potter books, but I gather they really always needed the next volume and then the next, etc.  This story seems to wrap up too tidily, too suddenly, too unbelievably.  She develops the characters pretty well and doesn't make any glaring errors in continuity, but then she doesn't know how to wind it down comfortably.  Or maybe she just got tired of keeping all of the balls in the air.  It doesn't end with a klunk but it lacks some sort of a better wind down.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|I saw Oren speak and was intrigued by the psychological disposition of human beings and developing an uncommon method of persuasion.

B009GI8J1O|5.0|In reviews for the film version of Cloud Atlas, many reviewers noted that the original novel was \\"unfilmable\\".  In my experience this is always a compliment, suggesting some level of complexity or nuance that can't be communicated in a two hour film.  So I skipped the film and read the book and was not disappointed.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas' \\"unfilmability\\" lies in its unconventional structure and multi-generational scope.  There are several markedly different narrators across several hundred years of history, telling stories that seem only vaguely interrelated, and whose interconnectedness is not fully realized until the last bit of the novel.  The intricacy of the individual stories and shifts in tone and narrative are usually sufficient to distract the reader from the fact that he/she doesn't understand how all the pieces fit together.  The individual stories are compelling in and of themselves, and the final result is more than satisfying.<br /><br />Unfortunately the \\"unfilmable\\" structure also poses problems for the Kindle edition.  For example, the first section of the book ends abruptly mid-sentence.  This sort of device works well on the printed page, but led me to suspect that my digital edition was somehow corrupt.  I actually had to find a physical copy of the book to confirm that the Kindle edition was intact.  (The abrupt ending to the section is explained later in the narrative).<br /><br />After reading the book, I wonder why the author even attempted to have it adapted for the screen.  The only answer I can come up with is money, ironic given the strong anti-capitalist thread that runs throughout the book.  The excellence that Mitchell accomplished with Cloud Atlas could never be reproduced faithfully in film and he ought not have tried.  Here's hoping for many more ambitious, well-crafted, and \\"unfilmable\\" novels to come.
B006WB7IN8|5.0|This grippingly scary book had me feeling paranoid that I was being watched! I could not put it down and even skipped lunch to continue reading this. I'd compare it to the films \\"Enough\\" or \\"Sleeping with the enemy\\" but oh so much better. A fantastic, thrilling first novel, leaving me eagerly awaiting further publications.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Bought this set for dad for Fathers Day and he absolutely loved it! The book-llike quality of the case that houses the disks was really cool, and the whole family has had a great time watching them! My only complaint is that Episodes IV, V, and VI are the remastered versions where they've added in some CGI effects that don't look quite like they fit into the movie. Otherwise, it's great!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Before reading this book, I read some reviews and was worried about how people were upset about the ending. Even though the choice I would of enjoyed reading would of been different I agree with the ending. With all the growth of the characters and trauma, I wouldn't of picked anything less then what I got. Really enjoyed the series, kinda thirsty of more, but I felt a journey from beginning to end.

1564148793|5.0|Average people have traveled places, been to events  and even eaten food or taken drugs that could bring curses upon them. You might have traveled within your country or to exotic places and people thrown curses upon you for crossing some person or just because elements of other places spoke against You could have gone to a dinner party or restaurant and eaten food that throws a curse on you since you were a child or older. You could have taken drugs like marijuana or hash and simply by using the substance be cursed by devils or Satanist. Curses thrown by people using psychedelics are particularly dangerous. They can invoke ancient elements long called kept off the earth by protecting guards or sentries established by witches or goddesses of the world above or below. Not every one can travel to remote places find a shaman and break all these curses each time they are placed. If used properly this book can save lives. Those that curse trick people into not believing in the magic effecting them so it can do more damage than if you are aware of the curse. If you are ill and don't know it you cannot be cured by a doctor, same with magic if you are cursed the curse can be a great burden on you until all curses broken.  This book if used properly can help break curses thrown by witches, sorcerers , magicians and shaman. Beware!
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Classic movie from the 80s used to launch Sean Astin and a few others into stardom.

It's always nice to know how the band got to the place they are today. Great music and interviews also. Hope that they keep on performing for us &#34;classic rock&#34; people.
B000KUD2G4|2.0|Product does not actually remove 60 cycle hum.  It does make it more manageable but the it also lowers the over all volume.<br />If you plan on using this product for single coil pickups, it doe snot work.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|The Eagles perfect their performances so well that a recording of the performance is better listening than the original recorded songs.<br />Couldn't get over the great sound that the dvd has on just your regular sound bar and sub woofer. I liked it so much that I had a friend make a cd of the audio so I can listen to it in my car.  Wish they would make a CD so I could buy it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It works as it is intended.  No issues with installation or use.  And you simply can't beat the price... FREE...
B000I0QL82|5.0|Wondeful movie, playful theme. It really get s ou in the mood for th eholiday season, and of coure Bing Crosby sings White Christmas.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This one of the best cartoon movie I ever see. I will recommend it to everyone. buy it is great.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I love this version of White Christmas. The santa is so believable and Natalie Wood is adorable. This is a must have for a holiday collection.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This one the first movie I see of Spider Man, my son wan to see it, I will buy the other ones too.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband. He really likes the original movies, but I liked the idea of having the complete set in our library.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|It works just as advertised. Good construction, fits well, sturdy and overall a quality product. I would purchase this again in a different color, the white gets dirty.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book was hard to put down but not in a good way. The things the guards did to Shin were disgusting & non-human. I'm very glad he has the courage to let the world know what's going on in North Korea.
B001XUYA0W|4.0|The plot is interesting-I found the film itself  very often dark and the audio(for me ) was hard to understand so much whispering and mumbling.  I have a slight hearing loss to explain part of my problem. But for others with the same problem be aware.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun to play. I like that u come back to it and don't have to start over each time. You also don't have to spend real money.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought this USB cable to replace the original cable that came with my Kindle.  It worked perfectly!  It correct the problem of the cable not charging the Kindle.  Probably due to a wiring disconnection.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is a great epic film directed by Tim Burton with a wonderful supporting cast. See it. Read the book, too. Book is by Daniel Wallace and he was pleased with how Tim Burton conveyed it onto the screen.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|thought provoking, joyful, sad . Beautiful character development. look forward to reading other books by this author. Couldn't put it down.
B000002KDO|5.0|I have always loved Black Sabbath since I was like twelve years old. I think this is one of their better ones since Paranoid.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I hate to see the series end.... I've really enjoyed all the books and have read each book several times.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|I am a huge fan of Lady Austen. She has a way about her pen that is quite intriguing. I enjoyed the full immersion in this book. I will be reading it again. Bon ape`read
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|&quot;The Room&quot; is a great mind exercise! Not just another cheesy game. You really have to think when solving this puzzle. I loved it.....
B008UX2UIO|5.0|The author does a great job creations original characters that aren't cliches or predictable. The book does a great job of entertaining you at every step, and making you root for ironic characters that other books don't use as their protagonists. The best part of the books is the end where the author ties everything together beautifully, creating a perfect ending!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|it is fine.  but the issue is that my kindle does not maintain a charge and it is slow to take a charge this item did not seem to help
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Shopped around for this as a gift for my son. Could not beat the price!! Thank you.. I need 3 more words to submit this. I'm at a loss.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very interesting game where's the rest of the levels :-( just as I started enjoying it WE NEED MOREE LEVELSSSSSSSSSS
B007XF4J66|5.0|This was a gift and it was well received.  It was like watching this classic for the first time all over again.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This is a motivating book.  Easy read, extremely powerful and sets you back on your path.  Pick it up now.
B005KQVDH8|2.0|Ok film, acting was good but not for adults. I purchased this thinking it that this film had a touch of adult humor but for the most part, it was geared for kids.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|It is a wonderful story, which is hard to find in today's movies. So much in today's movies is about special effects, but this relied on the story to carry the film, coupled with good acting performances. Since my daughter did not have a chance to see it in the theaters, I gave it to her for her birthday. Enjoy my dear!
B00D37UP4S|5.0|This was a good movie, I would watch it again. Very interesting outlook on the alien life force and its intentions
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I might love this game like all the others if I could figure out how to play it!. More detailed directions for those who have never played before would be helpful. I click all over the room but nothing happens, it just sits there staring at me.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|pretty good. early levels are pretty fast and makes it annoying but all in all a decent game. worth the try
0553386794|5.0|I started out watching the HBO series (I know blasphemy) and wanted to get deeper into the characters. This book is impossible to put down!
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Kanye West created a critic-bait album and the critics fell for it, hook, line and sinker.  They interpret the album's hazy, unfinished production as \\"experimental\\" and his juvenile lyrics as \\"edginess\\". Don't be fooled, this album is horrible.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Kanye and enjoy all of his previous work, even the controversial 808s.  I am open minded about experimentation and love electronic music. The first time I listened to Yeezus, I thought something was wrong with my computer.  I listened to it five more times to make sure I wasn't missing something.  Nope, this is straight garbage. Actually, the more I listened to it, the more angry I got. This ninja is actually comparing his trivial celebrity lifestyle issues to the Civil Rights movement! \\"Blood on the Leaves\\" is a nice track but he's sampling an anti-lynching song to make yet another sour relationship ode. For an African-American with a respect for history, this is downright blasphemous.<br /><br />This closest thing to Yeezus that I can remember is Prince's abortion of an album, Chaos and Disorder (I'm really dating myself). Total trash from a gifted artist. At least Prince had the excuse of a contractual beef with Warner Bros; what is Kanye's excuse?<br /><br />Hopefully this will serve as the low point of his career.  The critical acclaim is worrying, but I think the tepid sales so far should serve as a nice slap in the face.  Wake up Mr. West!
B007EECSFA|5.0|great gothic mystery, keeps you guessing until the very end.  spans multiple generations and shows how each character's actions  influence the future
B006YC74E8|5.0|I used this app to edit photos for me and my friends and they turned out amazing!! We didn't need professional photography.. and this worked very well for us! thank you!
B00008XFAF|3.0|I bought this DVD to go with Warner Archives release of A GUY NAMED JOE, the film upon which this movie was based.  A GUY NAMED JOE is still a great movie -- ALWAYS is still \\"not\\" a great movie.  The high points of ALWAYS for me will be:<br /><br />1. the aircraft -- the B-26K and PBY Catalina smoke jumper planes<br />2. Holly Hunter's white dress and the juke box playing SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES<br /><br />The rest of the film is completely forgetable.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|I can say that because I am also old.  These are fine actors who seem to be having a great time, and so I also had a great time with them.  I do wish some of the actors in supporting roles could have been given more time to sing and play for us, but I was thankful for what I was given.  I will watch this movie again.  That alone is high praise.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Excellent thriller with a bit of fun thrown in. Very good acting by some pretty good actors and actresses. Story line moves along throughout.
B00A0SQBDM|2.0|The graphics are very detailed with distinct colors. The game was challenging.  The story fun. My only complaint is that the game was priced as free, but it turns out that free only applies to the first half of the game.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I bought it because I liked the song Radioactive a lot, but the rest of the album is great too.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Gotta love it!  The 2nd one was even better. It is intelligent for adults as well as enjoyable for kids.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|always a great source of info on local attractions and services. Objective (for the most part) reviews by seasoned travelers. Once you weed out the occasional &#34;My week in paradise was ruined by a mediocre burger&#34; reviewer, the information can be very helpful if only for the volume of contributors that will provide a more realistic consensus. Do a good job of removing inappropriate/inaccurate reviews.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What an amazing storyteller. Completely moved by and lost within this book.  Hosseini makes each character so real and human, and as I try to write this review, I'm unable to describe with words all the different emotions and revelations I had as I read the book. Excellent. Would recommend to everyone I know.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|This is undoubtedly a good read about a story that more people ought to know about and appreciate, and Stephen Greenblatt tells it well, though with somewhat uneven prose. The saga of Renaissance humanist Poggio Bracciolini and how he rediscovered Lucretius' On the Nature of Things is historically interesting in his own right (though Bracciolini is not quite as unknown, at least in Italy, as the author makes him to be). And of course the content and long-term historical impact of the work itself deserve much more appreciation than it is usually accorded. The reader will find interestingly heterogeneous material that will keep her attention throughout, as Greenblatt writes about Poggio's personal history and the complexities of the Renaissance environment in which he operated, moving to an explanation of Epicurus' doctrines (which Lucretius was popularizing with his beautiful poem), and to the broader significance of the work and of the Epicurean and atomistic worldview in general. If anything, I wish the author had spent more time on the latter aspect of his tale, which after all is a major reason why it was worth to write a book like The Swerve to begin with. Still, here you'll find history, science, philosophy, poetry and human intrigue, frailty and nobility. Hard to imagine a better cocktail to entice you to read.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|&#34;Persuasion&#34; is a wonderful adaptation of one of Jane Austen's classics. The characters are very believable. It's a clean, thought-provoking film appropriate for even younger audiences.
B007MDB71O|5.0|We watch this several times a month.  It is a family favorite for movie night.  Great action and fun for the whole family.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Some ppl are controversial on this book. I however, adore it. It's not for the closer minded, that's for sure. I stumbled upon this book on accident. I was looking for a good read as I read A LOT and was searching the web for book reviews. There were a considerable amount of ppl raving about this book and just as many shutting it down, I actually decided NOT to read it. I'd never heard of it before and figured it would probably suck considering how many people disliked it. I came across it on sale at Wal-Mart and add I had not yet found another book to full it's position I purchased it and figured for $8.00 it was with a try even if I didn't end up liking it. I've read my fair share of trashy romance novels and in the beginning I was disappointed because I thought that was what it was. This book is definitely explicit but it also has a truly amazing story to it. Backbone if you will. There are FEW trashy romance novels that have any sort of satisfying story behind it. I thoroughly enjoyed all the risque parts of this book but truly, honestly loved the story. This book had me hot & bothered, laughing out loud, and crying throughout. It's a page turner for sure, I've stayed up many late nights because I refuse to put it down. I've read the series 3 times now and it never gets old. Amazing job to E.L.James, I would DEFINITELY buy anything else she writes.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great story. It is hard to find a story that is not some close derivative to something else I've read already but this was one! Thank you and I will definitely read anything else you write!
B000000OMP|5.0|I always considered this one of the best Whitesnake albums. Like many reviewers say, there is no bad song in this album. Brilliant rock, great musicians including the late Cozy Powell on drums. David Coverdale performing high level vocals and sleazy but insinuating, not nasty , lyrics.Up to that point Whitesnake was popular in Europe, but no so much in the United States.Love every song , but just to mention a few, I love Slide it in, Give me more time, Slow and easy , and Guilty of love. This last one was very popular in concerts. Love ain't no Stranger is awesome and so is All or Nothing.<br />Mr. Coverdale delivering the goods . I do like the more hair band period that came a couple of years after this album, but I prefer this first years of Whitesnake from 1977 to 1984. Either way I am a fan, don't get me wrong.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|This was a great movie.  It was not what I was expecting and was better than what I was hoping for.  The streaming video took a few minutes to get to 1080 but after that no issues.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This is a great set for the price. The picture quality is as you would expect from the blur ray disk.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was sucked into the show and wanted more when season 3 ended, so I decided to read the books--and I am glad I did. I love how Martin just pulls you in--and there is more time for history and backstories. I can't wait to read the next one!
0385474547|5.0|This is not a story for the faint of heart. But it will give the reader insights into the African Clan system that we might not have ever seen otherwise, at least not Achebe's spare and elegant style of writing. I spoke with clergy from Africa recently and they both (in separate conversations) recommended his final book, There was a Country. I own it, but it has to stand in line with other books calling me to be picked up!
B00C5XBAOA|3.0|My girls (ages 3 and 6) have been in love with the new Sofia the First Series on Disney Junior since it came out. We have every episode on our DVR and we purchased all the MP3 songs. We have also bought several of the storybooks and the Disney Store Figurines.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying, I had my eye on these toys since the day they went up for pre-order on Amazon.  Many times, I almost hit that pre-order button, but the minimal discount that Amazon was offering didn't really give me a reason to do so.  Because of that, I decided to wait.  After they came out, I read all of the Amazon Reviews and I was really bummed that everyone basically hated all of Sofia the First toys from Mattel.  I told my wife that they are terrible, and she was bummed too.  Fast forward to Target Tuesday (when my wife and girls go to Target together to get the week's groceries).  During their browsing through the toys, my littlest one saw this set and that was basically it.  My wife explained to them that the toys weren't very good, but they didn't care one bit.  My youngest only really wanted the King and Queen because they didn't come with the Disney Store Figurines set.  They left without the set that day, but we didn't hear the end of it.  Last week, the set went on sale and a Target coupon came out at the same time for it so we gave in and let them use their birthday gift cards on this set, only because it had the King and Queen.<br /><br />As for the set, my girls absolutely love it.  They love being able to have the King and Queen to play with.  The figures look nice enough and are true to the cartoon.  As for the quality, everything that all the other reviewers are saying is basically true.  The King and Queen can't sit down, the King doesn't stand up well, the heads are very wobbly (though they haven't fallen off as often as I expected), etc, etc, etc.  That being said, none of this matters to my girls.  They absolutely love the set and love playing with them.  We warned them that the heads would fall off all the time, but they didn't care about that either.<br /><br />Long story short, we are happy with this set because our girls are happy with this set.  I went in expecting it to be terrible and not worth the money, and bought it only because I knew my girls would enjoy it no matter what.  My girls would give it 5 stars, but I can't in good conscience because of the quality.  It was nice that we got it on sale at Target, so that made it better.  With the dissatisfaction that Mattel is having with this set, you might want to look for sales if you want to buy them.  I don't expect to buy any of the other sets or the castle (the cardboard floors in the castle are basically a deal breaker for me), but this set is nice because it has the King and Queen.  As for a recommendation, read all the reviews and decide for yourself if this set is worth it and if you think your kids will like it as much as mine do.  If you decide against it, make sure to avoid the Sofia the First toy aisle when you have your Sofia the First fan in tow.them that the heads would fall off all the time, but they didn't care about that either.<br /><br />Long story short, we are happy with this set because our girls are happy with this set.

B00338QENI|5.0|As someone with a longstanding interest in cellular biology and in bioethics (I have taught college-level courses in the subject), I found the story of the HeLa cells to be fascinating. Having heard of this famous culture several years ago and knowing that it had come from the cancerous cervix of a poor black woman in 1951 and was still alive and well today, finding a book about Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells was grist to my mill. I figured I would learn about the history of these cells, and would also encounter issues that I could discuss with my bioethics students. I was not disappointed. There is certainly enough information not just about the HeLa cells, but about other issues (e.g., Ms. Lacks' were not the only cells that were used without consent), that it would be possible to fill up an entire semester of discussion in a bioethics class based on the issues raised in this book.<br /><br />Moreover, as a result of Rebecca Skloot's research and her interviews with a number of people who were involved in the early days of the culturing of the HeLa line, we have a most fascinating (and at times disturbing) look into the medical science of the day. This by itself is almost worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Finally, the description of the conditions in which Ms. Lacks was reared as well as her family dynamics growing up and even as an adult, plus the account of the less than adequate healthcare that many African Americans received in the 1950s and even later, provide a grim but needed reminder of the inequality that was part of America through much of the twentieth century.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Captivating story that only Stephen King can write.  Well done.  Would recommend to anybody that even isn't a King fan.
B005VU9LVI|5.0|This edition looks way better than what I originally thought.  The picture is so clear.  The commentary is great (as usual).  Just an overall great Blu Ray
B00D2BHO44|5.0|As great as the game was. Heck, you could enjoy this even if you haven't played the game. Give it a listen.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|As described easy to use and holds a good amount of wipes, slight bigger than usual wipes cases but very well made. Recommend this product.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|Rented this after watching the prequel Monsters University. It was fun to see them in order even though we had seen Monsters Inc when it first debuted.
B005USZYDU|5.0|this book was one of the greatest books i have ever read in my entire life i love this book
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find this app extremely easy to use. I set up daily reads for myself, and always remember to read each day when I see the Bible Icon. Unlike remembering to grab my Bible and read whatever I have chosen to read daily for the month. I also like that there are different versions and easy to read modern English. I highly recommend this to anyone who has the interest to read the Bible.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season Three of this exceptional series is presented again with such exquisite attention to details - from setting and wardrobe to the complex interactions between the characters.  Kudos to the writer, Fellows, especially.  His talent for conveying the essence and outcome of exchanges we never even witness is nonpareil.  In my home, we find ourselves talking about the characters on a first name basis, as if they are (or were) real people.  This is like being a fly on the wall to the human strengths, frailties, doubts and triumphs that exist in everyone's life.  Maggie Smith delivers many observations and criticisms of her family members with a subtle condescension that is at once harsh and humorous.  &#34;Patience is a virtue&#34; applies whiles waiting for Season Four!
B004GYY714|5.0|I absolutely love this app! I enjoy listening to talk shows in the evening on wines around the world, and there is every radio station you can think to listen to. Very easy to use.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Incredibly imaginative story.  Fabulous cinematography and effects.  The movie leaves you wondering which story is true....or are they both?  And...does it matter?
B007T99ENE|5.0|Ian McEwan is one of my favorite author. What I liked in Sweet Tooth is a bit mysterious, the novel is very well written and McEwan with his cleverness pulled me as a reader throug the novell with some magic. That is McEwan stile you can't stop reading until you are finish. McEwan finish the novel with open ending and that suits the novel perfect, the reader can enjoy the doubts. My opinion is, that this novel is fantastic and worth every minute in reading.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|...Does it ever evolve?  Thank God we have examples of kind heartedness, compassion and love in the world - be it in a fantasy movie or real life.  This film runs the gamut of human traits, from Ego and Control to Victim and Submission.  Jennifer Lawrence does a good job of evolving into an example of the eternal human traits that keep our spirit strong and fill us with conviction.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's hard to stop playing once you start! Especially since its with dinosaurs. I recommend to anyone who loves the apps that are for building your own
B00AF6B22E|4.0|I ALWAYS want to like Denzel.  He did a great job of convincing me of his alcoholism and addictive nature from the git go.  But it takes him longer to convince himself.  As the traps he sets for himself begin to snap closed, we see the denial begin to turn to awareness and then acceptance, and in the end his heart refuses to accept the lies he has perpetuated at the expense of someone else.  I don't know if it was the movie sound track or my TV, but there are a lot of soft spoken lines and mumbled conversations which caused me to replay many sequences.  Nonetheless, it's worth it.  Denzel shines.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|The book grabbed my attention immediately, but it seemed forever until the robbery.<br />The first few months in Canada were so detailed, and then nothing more was mentioned about the rest of the character's boyhood, education, etc.<br />I did enjoy the story in general, but even the ending was uneventful.
6304711905|5.0|I don't care if the details are fiction or non-fiction.  This is a wonderful story of love on many levels.  Throw in honor and loyalty and this movie speaks to us all.  Flavored with the harshness of the commonplace Old West lifestyles and social mores, it's easy to see how the laws evolved, once men of commitment and character stood their ground against ruthlessness.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|This program does work well on the Kindle.  I have no complaints about how it works or stalling/crashing.  Does like it's suppose to which is check your hotmail account.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I Loved it! ive wanted to see this movie for a while and once I saw it it was amazing!!
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Why on earth is Marion Cotillard not listed among the cast? Surely she was not unknown at the time this movie was made...
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|this movie tells a wonderful tender story.  the scenery is beautiful and this movie is exciting and never boring. it is scary at times, but it is a true story and it is compelling. the acting is great.
B004E5GG50|4.0|I am very pleased with this purchase. The only problem, if that is one, is that it is a bit too expensive.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|This artist is amazing...he is a combination of Dave Mathews and James Taylor. I could listen to him all day! Great stuff.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I love Emeli Sande.  She has a terrific voice.  This entire CD is great, especially the song Clown.  I listen to this CD over and over.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I did not like the subject.  I read the book at my sons request and the movie is coming out. After reading the book I will not go see the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very enjoyable.  The characters are so real.  You can't help getting involved with them. Each episode is better than the last as the characters and story come to life.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|better than the paid ones!  all the features you need at the right price - FREE!  Three more words are required?  How dumb!
B0037A4ILC|5.0|This could easily be the best mountaineering movie ever made. Not a documentary, but extremely accurate with regard to hardware and technique used during the 30s & 40s and to some extent all the way into the 70s.
B002APU580|5.0|this is an excellent movie that shows you what it was like to live in this time period in England.  Plus it's an incredible love story.  very much worth it.  Emily
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Narcoleptic. Big Name filmmaking at its worst. I haven't met one moviegoer who didn't fall asleep during this film. The soundrack is little more than a funeral dirge.<br /><br />THE ONLY scenes worth seeing<br /><br />Jones' equal before the law speech & any scene with Sally Field speaking, especially her quarrel with Lincoln! Both are probably on youtube.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Great concert. Great musicianship. You'll love it. Supertramp fans must have this DVD. Sound is great, video is great. Get it!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|We did enjoy this movie. It was a very nice story and even better because it was based on a true story. I did not think Richard Gere did a very good job. He seemed rather disinterested.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun game for kids and adults keeps me interested, can't wait to get to the higher levels. I recommend this game to all
B0048WQDIE|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  It was so much like the world is today as far as people as they appear to others verses who they really are.  The book was funny and serious at the same time.  I would everyone to read it and then look closely at some of the people around them and compare their actions to those in this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Ok...the first puzzle was a snap, then the next got a little harder... This is really different from the brain-teaser games I'm used to. I am totally obsessed. You look around the room thinking, there is no possible place I didn't look, then voila, you figure out the missing thing you need to open the door and you are transported to the next level...and a new set of clues to figure out. It's so addicting. Consider yourself warned!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played it has got every one who ive told to download this app
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I bought this movie for my father who was directly involved in the Iran hostage crisis.  He enjoyed it thoroughly, although he had some things to say about its historical accuracy (they did their best, though, I'm sure).
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It just force closed the first time I opened it and kept force closing all the other times I tried to open it. Sonic just deleted it off my kindle
B00009TB5G|5.0|You really haven't lived until you've seen the extended versions of the LOTR movies.  They are much truer to the books and would be much more informing to the layperson who watches the movies but has never read the books.  I guarantee everything will make crystal-clear sense if you take the time to watch the extended versions.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I trust enough have seen or heard about this movie to go over the plot, but I did watch it with, and then without, the commentary which I always find very informative. It was the director Nora Ephron who did the commentary and spoke of problems with various scenes, the professional attitude of Meryl Streep, how the actress who played JUlie Powell never cooked another lobster after making this movie, and how the actors in it, when agreeing to accept the roles, understood it would mean eating, and eating, and eating, and eating. I might put in a plug for the real Julie Powell who was called some unflattering names, but what she did in preparing each and every dish in Mastering The Art of French Cooking I would like to see them try! No, I did not buy the cookbook, nor My Life in France, but I did buy both for my sister. I did buy Julia Child's Cats and loved it, and the movie also got me to buy Dearie which, while it is a very large book, turned out to be an easy read. This movie I have seen countless times, along with the behind-the-scenes feature as well. Even if you don't enjoy cooking (I do) you ought to give it a try if you haven't already seen it. To watch two stories intertwine is fascinating, even if they were decades apart. It was sad that Julie never met Julia face to face, but at least in tackling such a formidable project, Julie learned to cook.
0920668372|5.0|I grew up with this book.  I can safely say that it should be required reading for all youth; it was an axiom of my childhood.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I had taped The Lion King from The Disney Channel, and a few years ago was able to transfer it onto a DVD but while it was nice to have it in that format its quality suffered a bit. So I decided to buy it on a DVD since I watch the movie a lot. Even though I am in what I could call my lower old age period, I thoroughly enjoy watching this and listening to Elton' John's and Tim Rice's compositions. The plot is simply to follow. A young cub who &#34;can't wait to be king&#34; watches his father die in a stampede and is blamed for it by his uncle. He leaves Pride land and is taken in by a warthog and a meercat with whom he grows up on a diet of grubs. Then comes a time when a lioness charges at him and pins him to the ground. It is then Simba recognizes his &#34;girlfriend&#34; Nala, who tells him he must return to Prideland and take over as king. However Simba no longer wants to be king or see his mother because of believing Scar's charge that he killed his own father. It is a tense situation but the movie takes care of the problem and delivers a splendid ending. The animation is clear and vividly colored and the songs are superb. I especially liked Hakuna Matata sung by the warthog Puumba and the meercat Timon, and the opening song, Circle of Life, is well-suited for introducing the viewer to Mufasa and his friend a baboon presenting the newborn Simbo as Mufasa's heir to the throne. I don't have children, so I will leave it to parents to decide if it is suitable or not. As for me, I will never tire of looking for animated movies with what it takes to capture my imagination. This one certainly filled the bill.
0140557741|5.0|I love everything about Mr. Banyai's books, especially this one, ZOOM, his original best in my opinion.  Takes me back to my childhood.  It is a very special book, required reading for every child.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great hidden pictures game. There is so many scenes and different  places to visit. The hidden pictures  are so great one of the best I have seen.  I have  spent many hours playing this game I would definitely  suggest that if you love hidden pictures games you will WENT to get this game. I think the hidden pictures game with a great story and mystery behind  them are the best.  Get it. You will have lots of fun. Ddmiller
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Bought this movie for my dad and he loved it.  When I watched it, it was action-packed and chillingly honest.  It didn't leave out the gritty details of the story it explores, nor should it have.  Outstanding movie.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|...as long as you don't mind the violence.  The best thing about the movie is the confidence of characters as they carry out their deeds - and, the fact that society thinks the characters are done after years of service, and they definitely are not.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I love the Matrix trilogy and this is as complete as can be, especially with the essential Animatrix supplement.  5/5
B00COGY2P2|4.0|The story was good and the acting was actually good. Tom Cruise did an excellent job along with a good supporting cast.  The best thing I personally liked about it is that the Jack Reacher character decided to look at the situation at hand deeper than what seemed obvious on the surface. We live in such a world of &#34;marketing spin&#34; that we often get caught living our lives without really looking or thinking. This movie reminds us to see true causes.
0062235893|5.0|If you are a parent, this book is essential reading for every child.  I haven't met anyone who never experienced this book while growing up.  This version is soft and comforting; although I remember it being somewhat longer as a youth.
0451205766|5.0|the movie is for my daughter and she loves it she said it is a great movie i would buy it myself it she hadden purchased it
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|great album, excellent artist, well produced and written songs from a real artist and writer for many years.  Recommended always
B007XHWROK|1.0|justin bibier stinks! he's terrible! he sounds ridiculous! he's the worst singer ever. I hope he ends his career soon
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game really challenged my first grader to think and solve problems. Quite enjoyable for adults as well. I recommend this for all ages.
B00D3XAA4M|3.0|I especially liked the mention of places in Croatia.<br /><br /> Just a hint about how to get to the suggested places (like those in cities like Paris, Rome, Berlin, & Amsterdam) would have been nice to have.<br /><br />I know Lonely Planet is trying to sell their other travel guides (including links to their online stores) but a cheapskate can look up the places mentioned here on Wikipedia for more info about them.
0321934946|5.0|Not only this is a very well written book, but it goes to the point. No need for a lot of preparation or theory, it just teaches you how to get great pictures.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Great movie which brings back some of the reasons we love the Connery Bond. And that Adele song is awesome.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am finding this book as good as his others and find it hard to put down.  It is easy to get caught up in the story. Having traveled to many countries, I can imagine just what the author is writing.
1401216676|5.0|Best Joker comic ever! The story was thoroughly intriguing from start to finish. It had parts of Joker's past and why he became the Joker. It arrived in perfect condition. I'd recommend this to all Joker fans! (a must have)
B001Y8WAJ6|5.0|While alot of the fans who want Saxon doing hard music i tend to like albums that have more artistic songs in it ! Crusader was one of those albums to do that ! Saxon became great when the released Power and the Glory which was thier best album ! Crusader is a close 2nd ! I love the whole album but my favorite tracks are the title song , Sailing to America , do it all for you and Set me Free ! I bought the cass. When this first came out then waited years to get it on cd ! Power and the Glory and this one is part of the soundtrack to my beloved 80s and my late teens and early 20s ! If your someone who likes a little melodic music with your metal and aint one who thinks all music should be heavy and hard buy this kuz its a great album !!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|A superb series.  Somehow, Downton Abbey manages to be a &#34;Masterpiece&#34; series without putting one to sleep.  In this season, the exit of Matthew and Sybil is quite disappointing.  However, Julian Fellows, will, no doubt, keep all of us hanging on for season 4.
B001Y8WAKA|5.0|When Power and the Glory was first released my friend had bought the cass and played it for me ! I knew instantly i needed to get it myself ! From top to bottom this is Saxons best album ! My favorite songs are watching the , suzi hold on , redline and nightmare ! I bought the cd about a year ago with my only gripe being the version of Suzi Hold On isnt the same as the one on cass ! Does anyone know where i can get the Power and the Glory cass version of Suzi hold on ? Other than that this is a great album with a nice mix of hard and melodic metal and worthy of 5 stars !
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Re reading this book getting ready for the release of Losing Hope tomorrow and can't believe I forgot how much I LOVE this story!! How much I LOVE Dean Holder and how much I LOVE the emotions and feelings this book brings out in me!! This is such a powerful read and a must read for anyone who is looking for a story with depth!<br /><br />I love how much everything ties together from her past to now, something as small as Dean holding her pinky when stargazing! I can't even begin to imagine how hard it must be to write a book that has to link so perfectly and something has to be said for Colleens talent in this!! She is a must read and her writing deserves all the success it has brought her!!
B004G606K8|5.0|What can I say about The Chronicles? At the age of 23, it's safe for me to say I've grown up with Dragonlance. Each of the Companions stand out in my mind like memories of dear friends. In a world dark with confusion (be it Earth or Krynn), the companionship of the Heroes of the Lance will continue be a bastion of light for as long as the novels are read. Thank you
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|The leading actors (male and female) are superb in portraying personality disorders and Dinero captures the South Philly Eagles fan perfectly.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are terrific! Written for teenagers, but compelling to this adult as well. I couldn't put them down and then couldn't wait to start the next one!
B008R6MI8G|5.0|Good story. Little different than the first one I saw. Both were very good however. Liam is one of my favorite actors.
B001NLKT60|5.0|A totally engrossing series of stories! Mysterious and gripping suspense. Caution--could be too intense for anyone who has experienced assault.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|A decent shooter, but it suffers from the same thing that other games suffer from nowadays. They all want you to spend, spend, spend money for upgrades.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|The story line is good; however, the book isn't something I would get hooked on.  It's an easy read that kept my attention.
0694016756|5.0|My sister wanted an oversized version of this book for her baby.  Amazon offered a great price and it got here in time for her visit.  It is a keeper!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I knew before I began reading this novel that I would not be disappointed. The skill of her prose, vivid language, and characters that got into your head made an enjoyable read. Yet, I do have to say it became just s tad elementary and slow about 84%of the way through, but to pick back up with such a climatic ending made up for it. I know some people cannot get the amazing composition of HARRY Potter out of their minds as they read this novel for an older audience, but I think it is a good thing. For readers that grew up reading Harry Potter and her other books this book was published just in time for us who are now adults
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|Overall the movie is fragmented and abstract.  Good for watchers who possess high levels of attention. Overall acting was a &#34;C&#34; at best.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|I started reading this book twice. On the first go round I read approximately 50 pages and could not get into it.<br /><br />I am trashing this book now because after reading over 100 pages I still hate it.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on it.
B00C061I3K|4.0|I really like the album.  One wish is that Giorgio was split into two tracks so I didn't have to listen to the story every time.  It's worth the money.
B005UG542S|5.0|I xidnt like that the good guys were only stunning the bad guys allowing them to recover and get back in the fight quickly and then contribute to the killing of the good guys. I also thought that malfoy was just a kid under a bad influence and in the end he couldn't kill Dumbledore , Harry saves him, the Draco and Lucious wouldn't give away Harry's Identity, My point Is, The Malfoys had learned theit lesson and had clearly become unwitting accomplaces of the dak lord, but at the end they showed a nomocity remained bettween the families where I had expected reconciliation. But the movoe, though I didnt care for a few thingd about it Espeacially killing off one of the twin! The movie was great I loved it.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a great game full of adventure and thrilling chases through forest and mines that leave you addicted to the game and wanting more.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|Truly enjoyed watching this and can't recommend it enough. This is a great tv show but definitely not for children.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I can't wait to own season 5. Watching the episodes non stop and with commentary is very insightful. This seems to be a turning point season.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Steven Speilberg knows how to make movies. this is a really good movie. he tells the side of Lincoln that nobody has ever known about and his struggle to get the 13th admedment passed. the movie is a little slow but daneil day-lewis and tommy lee jones's performance keeps it interesting with those two in the film there is no dull moment. and I think this movie should be shown in history classes. Daniel Day-Lewis did an outstanding job portraying one of our nations greatest leaders. he even looked like Lincoln. I thought that all the actors did a great job. steven speilberg is an amazing director one of the best in Hollywood today. i don't recall ever seeing a bad movie by hime. i don't think there is such a thing as a bad movie by him. all in all this was a amazing film.  if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was a really good movie. I was never into star trek but my mom wanted to see because she is a star trek fan. and for not watching any of the old movies or tv shows I thought that this was pretty good. now I want to watch the old movies and tv shows. just to let people who have not seen this movie yet it is basically a remake of the wrath of kahn but they did a good job at it. now I have to see the wrath of kahn. all in all this was a great movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do

0385335989|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is still doing what she was meant to do.....write a fantastic story.......  This book follows in the footsteps of the other ones and gives just as much detail as always.  I love here series!
B00B5A9FLY|4.0|I loved Merlin the series...... Actors were absolutely great!  Hope to see them in more movies/series.  However, I was disappointed in the ending of Merlin.  I don't understand why the producers decided to wait until the last minute for Merlin to reveal his true identity. This was so disappointing!  We know Arthur dies, but Merlin should have had more time in the series to work with Arthur and bring about the change in Camelot.  As usual acting was fantastic, just upset with the last season as there was time to reveal Merlin to Arthur and it wasn't done...
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Games of Thrones is right up there with the series on Merlin... The whole storyline is fantastic . Those who didn't read George Martins books will really love this movie as well as those who did.  I only wish the producers had stuck to the book a little more..... Sometimes when I view the movie I feel like they strayed way too far from the books of George Martin.. They really should have followed the books more closely, would have been, if that is possible, more enjoyable all around.  Actors and scenes are wonderful as usual.  So one can actually feel themselves caught up in the story!  Best movie in years!  Cant wait until I see the 3rd season and what happens!.......
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Excellent as usual..  but felt it was time to explore the interactions of Merlin and Arthur..... Producers should have revealed Merlin to Arthur around this time and made the rest of the series around it.  All in all loved it as usual though.

B006GLLXXK|5.0|Loved the books. Show is awesome, especially Bill. WOW! I wm just finishing the books and just starting the series. Am looking forward to both. Amazon was the only site I found where I could watch Season 1 Episode 1 for free. Now I am sure I want to see more. Thanks Amazon.
1572814349|5.0|the artistry is superb and speaks volumes more than the rider waite it is based on. Particularly an excellent deck to teach beginners to Divinational Arts with.
0553582038|4.0|After finishing A Storm of Swords and skimming through the reviews for this volume, I decided to stop. Who has time to plow through a 700 page book that is \\"boring\\" and \\"difficult to get through\\"? However, with a year to wait until the next season of the show, curiosity got the better of me and I forged ahead. I'm glad I did. While it is not as filled with action and twists as the previous books in the series, A Feast For Crows still has a lot to contribute. As the War of the Five Kings winds down, it is only natural that a certain amount of \\"resetting\\" will take place as new characters and conflicts emerge.<br />I enjoyed the \\"Iron Islands\\" chapters, comprised mainly of characters we have only heard spoken of before, and dealing with the conflict arising after the death of Balon Greyjoy. I also liked the Cersei chapters. There may not be a whole lot of \\"action\\" per se, but her manipulations and descent into paranoia and megolomania make for some riveting reading. Arya and Sansa also check in briefly. Their chapters are not bad to read, but honestly, they don't have a whole lot going on.<br />Where the criticisms are waranted are in the Brienne and Jamie chapters. These two are more or less wandering the countryside, making stops along the way to meet up with many (many, many, many) various minor characters and having many (many, many, many) conversations that don't amount to a whole lot. Up until her last two chapters or so, you could pretty much write \\"And Brienne searched for Sansa\\" and be caught up. Jamie's chapters suffer similarly, but are redeemed to an extent by a more interesting moral journey taking place, as well as having to adapt to his new physical handicap.<br />So basically, yes, some sections are plodding and there are far, far too many minor characters that one could never hope to keep track of, but you don't really have to in order to enjoy what the book has to offer. It may not be as focused and action oriented as previous volumes, but does deliver in a different way that seems to me to be a natural progression in the context of the overarching story being told.er in a different way that seems to me to be a natural progression in the context of the overarching story being told.
B00D2HTRVQ|1.0|Having the same problem as another reviewer. Paid full price for this game and it crashes when you try to fix the chair. First time I've had this problem with Dr. Panda games. Won't even give it to my 4 1/2 y.o. daughter, even though she has been begging for it. It will upset her. Please resolve soon!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The kind of show you hope to find but seldom do.  The actors fit the parts they were playing and made them seem so real that you forget your watching a show instead of a real slice of life.<br /><br />I watched all shows in one day!  Couldn't put it down!  The Abbey is stunning.  The cloths were works of art.  The story line was gripping and the director was masterful.  Unbeatable combination.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|All of the books in the series have something that makes you care about the characters although you know what's goign to hppen.  Older man sweeps younger flawed woman off her feet and they enter a contract where she is the submissive,
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This was a great way to spend my free time. I got to play like how I do when I'm at home on my PS3. But the reason that I gave it four stars is that it took forever to download. I get that it's a big game and all but... it took a lot longer then I expected. That's what really disappointed me. But over all it was great!
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|Bang Bang and A little Party Never Hurt Nobody are two of my favorites. Followed by Lana del Rey's song and Florence. Jack White's song is good as well.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Keep saying bribe not responding and crashing.  Can't view my subscription.  Can't download to watch later.  Annoying slow loading adds.  This is on a Kindle what is there that can screw it up.  Garbage.
B00AK57N00|4.0|I originally bought this for my iPhone. The family loved it so much I decided to get for the Kindle too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great, challenging game. It really makes you problem solve to escape the room. I highly recommend this game to all puzzle minded people.
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|Great films rise to the level of art, and art is something you can re-experience over and over.  The film does not change, but over the years we do.  Network is one of those films for me.<br /><br />In 1997 when I was 20, I appreciated its sarcasm and shock value; I also relished knowing of a movie almost no one else my age had heard of.  When I was 25, I marveled at its prophecy; not just FOX News, but in fact almost all of television.  At age 30, the cunning and evil power of Diana Christensen terrorized me.  Now at age 35–36, I've concluded that Howard Beale actually *was* imbued with a transcendent spirit.  But he failed to grab hold of it and bring it into maturity, and as a result his idealism was corrupted by the evil forces of the world.<br /><br />Like great works of art, I eagerly look forward to returning to it again and again over the years to see what it can tell me about how I have changed.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|The movie is excellent!!  Great story and my entire family loves it.  It is nice to finally see the Muppets back a in good movie.<br /><br />If you're counting on the soundtrack, don't.  The download expired last year sometime.  I tried contacting them and they basically told me 'tough luck, we'll let our marketing department know.'
B0060V1WJ6|3.0|The actors all did a great job, and it was definitely shot and edited well. The script itself leaves something to be desired, though. Too many awkward emotional moments that felt false, and what was with the nearly-adult babysitter giving the minor naked pictures of herself at the end? Really icky to watch.
B00364K6YW|5.0|All of the actors and actresses in this version are 100% believable. You find yourself traveling back in time and becoming absorbed in the story. We've seen it at least 50 times and never get tired of it.  Jennifer Ehle, Colin Firth, and the entire cast are magnificent.  The best of the best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game. It's like a mix of temple run and subway surfers. I'm addicted to it. And even better it's free! Take it from my opinion. (BTW I'm 11).
B007VDN1PA|5.0|It made it possible for us to load slides on to our computer.  It was one at a time but smooth and didn't take as long as we thought.  We also got great support from the company when we had questions.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|This movie is just silly. Made for small children or 20 somethings on hallucinogens. I think even recreational drug users will be bored by this one. I didn't make it to the end.
1781162646|3.0|Being a huge Stephen King fan (including works authored under his pseudonyms), I did not care for his \\"hard case crime\\"  I read the book in 2 days and<br />found it an easy read, but it lacked the excitement and intrigue held by his other works. -Angela  L.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everyone who watches it loves it, people who don't aren't smart enough to get it. Or don't like period pieces with great dialogue and complex character development.
0425252868|5.0|Just finished reading this book; an incredibly excellent read.  The writing is so good that I feel I am still wearing my flak vest.  The desert war, the attack against the B-17 Ye Olde Pub, the attack on the B-24's, evading escort fighters, ME 262 sections etc. are harrowing description of what WWII aerial combat was like both from the perspective of the attacker and from the receiving end of the 20 mm cannons.  The characters are so well developed you are riding along with them the whole way.  The untimely death of so many young men brought tears to my eyes thinking about what they did for their comrades and country.  I was very emotionally affected by this book; beyond historical, this is a strong human interest story about courage, compassion and forgiveness.  I highly recommend this one.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It is always interesting to see inside the mind of an elite athlete. The book did not influence me to try either a vegan diet or adventure out on ultra marathons. It was however fascinating to see what an elite ultra runner does to complete these types of runs. Glad I read it.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|simple game, fun.  a great time was had by all.  doing the review just to get the annoying pop up that asks me to review this game to go away.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This season of Downton Abby was equally as entertaining and surprising as the first two. Characters are further developed and some old issues/themes are revisited making this season riveting!
B006LSZECO|4.0|i didnt give it 5 stars because i was not moved by this book and did not feel anything for the characters.  it was simply a clever plot in well written prose.
B003RNXIBK|5.0|eminem is super good at rapping and has amazing songs. to me he is better than most rappers. EMINEM rocks!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|i would recommend this movie to adult audiences.<br />I didn't like all the foul language.<br />overall it was a good movie.

B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I love Elementary!  It's not true Sherlock Holmes, but as far as his personality, it's the closest version to the books that I've seen yet.  At least in this version he shows compassion when called for, which he did in the books.  And JLM and Lucy Lui have great chemistry.  I just hope the relationship stays true to the books, as well, and doesn't stray off into anything beyond platonic.
B004CAWKXE|5.0|I bought this album the day it came out and it is probably their best album yet!! Although they broke up, which I wish they haven't, I still follow Gerard Way through his True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys comics!!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am new at this. I have a lot of material that still needs to be developed into a good read.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The formatting of this was extremely wide screen. Even on a widescreen tv with 16:9 ratio there were large black bars on the top and bottom.  Its a good movie, fun to watch.
B000I0D450|4.0|The performances are very good in an entertaining story.  Norton does a great job in this as does Di Niro.  It was great watching Brando.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I've tried them all and Flipboard, hands down, is the best. By far. It's very easy (and quick) to set up your feed and preferences. I've used Pulse, Feedly, Zite, Newsify, News360 and TapTu. I prefer Flipboard and have it on all of my devices and phones. I love Early Edition 2 on my iPad but I still use Flipboard more. It's a really beautiful app on the Kindle Fire. I love the new magazine function--I can now save my favorites into the magazines I've created.<br /><br />7/10/13. *note:  Flipboard doesn't work very well on Kindle Fire. :( It looks amazing but takes forevvvvvvvver to load.  Never have had any issues with this app on iPhone 4 or 5, iPad or iPad Mini. Ever. Yes, I love Flipboard... just not on Kindle Fire.  I powered off the Kindle, that made Flipboard finally load again but once I tried to go to a certain category, it says it is loading again....and it never seems to finish loading. :/
B00296A4F4|5.0|Satrical, entertaining, and funny all in one show.  Teaches family values and how all people need to be accepting of others.
B003KGBIRU|1.0|Let me tell you, as someone who's live in India, this is probably one of the most pretentious and strangely accurate portrayal of white people using \\"exotic\\"  settings--from their point of view anyway--to satisfy their never-ending thirst for spirituality. Orientalist at best, orientalist at worst. I will never understand Wes Anderson's hipsterdom.
B008220BLG|5.0|This movie has something for everybody, warm or otherwise.  Yes, it's a zombie movie, but it's not very gross at all like some zombie movies.  There's action, comedy, romance, horror.  What more could you ask for?
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It is an awesome app! It is easy to use. Social is wonderful because you cant be friends with strangers. I think it is very wonderful for kids.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really had no interest in reading this book, mainly because I knew the writing left much to be desired. But a friend of mine urged me to look past the writing and engage in the overall theme of the book and that is this overpowering draw that two people can have over each other. CHEMISTRY is an amazing thing. I've never engaged in any of the kinky stuff, nor have I dated a man that had more baggage then a 747, but I get the overwhelming, crazy, and completely intoxicating experience of being with someone that you have an undeniable and seemingly unbreakable attraction to. THAT makes it worth reading...for people who've been through it, who have yet to or who dream about it.<br /><br />I'm on the second book...the writing gets better, thank goodness, though not THAT much better. Still...I feel breathless as I get lost in Ana's story. And yes, she's terribly immature, but she's 21 or 22 in her first love affair. I think I was just as clueless as she is back then. And I feel her need to try and bring that crazy man out of his darkness and I also understand her internal conflict of wanting to leave the insanity but not being able to fight the overwhelming draw of this relationship. If she was in her 30s or 40s with some experience and more self confidence, she probably would have rebuffed even the thought of being with this man.
0375869026|4.0|August (Auggie) is eleven years old and the main character of the story.  The story takes place in a large middle school.  Fifth and sixth graders who are bullied for their looks and have trouble making friends should read this book because they can relate to the main character.  The children in this story would always stare at Auggie.  They would walk trying not to touch him when switching classes.  The children would call him names behind his back but he would hear anyway.  Kids who read this book may see a person like them.  They can learn how Auggie feels and help learn to deal with their problems.  Bullying can happen to anybody in real life and someone might say \\"you have cooties\\" like they told Auggie.  The way Auggie dealt with bullying is what made the book stand out.  He would talk things over with his friends but he never gave in to the bullies.  He held his head up high and sometimes talked to parents.  Auggie is an inspiration to students and can make them feel proud of themselves. I like this book because it explains how August feels.  It talks about how Via, his sister, cares about him.  She doesn't let August feel lonely.  I also like that he talks about Star Wars.  I like to watch Star Wars, play Star Wars on my PS3, and I have five light sabers.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very engrossing, though I thought the end was a little over the top. They had a few discussion questions at the end which I likef

1781162646|3.0|Meant to be a light 1940's type paper back with a nostalgic cover and pulp type paper, but written by the very talented Steven King, I expected more. The idea was clever but what I read was a 1940's type paper back, and nothing more. Good for filling time until the next block buster comes along!

B009AMANBA|4.0|I like any thing to do with American history and this film certainly fitted in with my requirements. dragged on a bit but overall well worth recommending.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This will always be one of the all time classics.  For me it rates right up there with The Day The Earth Stood Still, and the original War of the Worlds.  It is a supurb story and just the right amount of special effects to enhance the story and not detract from it.  Naturally Robby the Robot, who was also a star on TV's Lost In Space, adds to entertainment factor.  A great movie for young and us oldsters alike.
1451695195|5.0|A spellbinding report of a remarkable journey into the unseen world.  Especially interesting since I am a physician and a spiritual person as well.

B007M45PMU|5.0|This Lumineers album is really easy to listen to.  I'm sorry I didn't purchase it sooner.  I've found that when I listen to this album that I must like all of the songs, because it ends and I want to listen again.  Maybe it's because I'm older, but I appreciate the easy going style of this band.

055380684X|5.0|Daniel Coyle's The Talent Code, explores the origin and construction of talent in humanity. Within the roughly 200 pages of text, Coyle explores a variety of modern talent hotbeds, Brazilian soccer players for example, in an effort to isolate the factors behind greatness. Coyle begins his exploration by starting with the biological facilities possessed by all humans--the building of neural pathways through the addition of myelin, a compound that serves as insulation and thus allows the neuron to fire more effectively and efficiently. In this section, a section that breaks scientific expertise down into basic terminology, Coyle allows the reader to understand how practice literally makes perfect through the extended construction of improved neural pathways.<br /><br />Coyle then heads to the hotbeds themselves, observing the world's best becoming the best. First providing an analytical breakdown of their deep practice, and then expanding upon this explanation, Coyle breaks down genius and greatness into the combination of deep practice, practice in which students engage in their field of study in an intense, driven manner, a manner that allows them to expand their abilities rapidly, and the ignition of said practice. Deep practice does involve and in fact thrives off of frequent and repeated error, error that is corrected and built upon by master coaches. Yet such practice requires a key component: desire. Desire comes through an area that Coyle terms as ignition, something that lights a fire among the youth and creates a desire to be great. For example Anna Kornikova's early success in her tennis career ignited a desire for young, Russian girls to play professional tennis.<br /><br />Lastly, Coyle explores those behind talent hotbeds and everyday talent growth: Master Coaches/Teachers. He provides extensive examples of these individuals in action--not only describing their methods and pedagogy, showing them in action, but also digging deeper, demonstrating how theybecame who they are. The skills of the master, what he terms as a Matrix of skills, are the product of years and years of practice, of trial and error, of undergoing the very same deep practice in the method of instruction that their pupils undergo in terms of their desired craft.<br /><br />Overall, the text is a quick read, one that all teachers, coaches, and parents should invest in so that they can understand those they influence.

B008JFUQ3O|3.0|Despicable Me (2010) was the first offering from Universal Pictures off-shoot Illumination Entertainment, and it's financial success proved that Pixar and Dreamworks can be beaten at their own game. Unfortunately, their bunny-based follow-up Hop (2011) was riddled with myxomatosis, whilst the environmentally-conscious The Lorax (2012) was an ecological disaster as far as critics were concerned. Thankfully, Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's Despicable Me 2 (2013) is a slick, inventive and thoroughly entertaining slice of animated nonsense that will enthral kids, amuse adults and rule at the box office.<br /><br />This time round, not-so-evil supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) is officially retired and spends his days caring for his beloved adopted kids and experimenting with jam recipes (naturally). His peaceful existence is shattered, however, when he is recruited by future love interest Lucy Wilde (Kirsten Wiig) and spy master Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) to join the infamous Anti-Villain League and track down the ringleader behind the heist of a mysterious serum. Gru's number one suspect is restaurant owner Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt), a dead ringer for his former partner in crime El Macho who was last seen riding a shark strapped with dynamite (how &agrave; la mode) into the gaping chasm of a volcano twenty years previously.<br /><br />Gru is one of the highlights of Carell's somewhat patchy career thus far, and although he's still very much the main character here, he's again outshone by his little yellow minions -who must be the stuff of merchandisers dreams. They are given a much more prominent role in the sequel, and whether it's their pastiche of Charles Ebbet's famous 'Lunch atop a Skyscraper' photograph or the inevitable Alien (1979) parody, practically every time they're on screen they inspire laughter. Wiig is fine as Wilde, though she does seems to be channelling Jennifer Aniston, whilst Bratt's Eduardo (who was to be voiced by Al Pacino) is a fun, if not very villainous villain.<br /><br />There is a ten-minute lull midway through this feisty sequel and the necessity of the film's 3D conversion is as debatable as ever (though the patented short minion film over the end credits remains impressive and proves that three dimensions can sometimes be better than two). Yet, despite a few dropped balls, Despicable Me 2 is silly but superlative family entertainment. With enough sugar in your system and an open mind, there's plenty on offer for both young and old.llainous villain.<br /><br />There is a ten-minute lull midway through this feisty sequel and the necessity of the film's 3D conversion is as debatable as ever (though the patented short minion film over the end credits remains impressive and proves that three dimensions can sometimes be better than two).

0425252868|5.0|The rhythm given in the text will transport you in History giving you the time to breath and appreciate the reading of the book, without submerging you in too many historical details that could be confusing at the end. The way you get into the story is brightly done, you could feel yourself in the shoes of the main two characters in the story. Besides the human side of the approach you will discover a large research done, punctuated with anecdotes that you will like to flag for future reference. The first pages are important, you are guided by the author in which direction the development of the story is done, so there is nothing surprising on that side. We can learn so much how German Air Force was thinking about the Party (Nazis) and how they behave during the war. There is a good and intelligent balance in between the psychological approach on the human side and the WWII historical details given in the background. The way the book is written bring you not only as a spectator but also as being in the mind of the actors, not only for the aviators but also for the people on the ground and even those behind the AA flak. The way the encounter of the two pilots is described will touch your heart, and will leave you with this distress to realize how evil war can be. At the end, you will realize you learned an incredible story, the book leaving you with the certitude you will get back into it.
B008KHG2K2|3.0|Good craftsmanship compared to other superman figures. The price is reasonable.<br />The problem is you cannot move his Arms or legs at all. So you can only pose it the way it is.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Jessica Lange has given a solid performance on both seasons of A.H.S. This show is a &#34;Must Watch&#34; She is truly amazing to watch in this series, and i'm glad she will be back for season three!

B007Q35PLI|5.0|I really thought Claire Danes was amazing in this movie.  You totally forget you are watching her as she takes on the role of Temple Grandin so well.  My sister teachers children who have Autism so I was really interested to learn more about it. Obviously not everyone experiences Autism like Temple does but it is still good to learn from someone else experiences.<br /><br />I totally recommend the movie! It is inspirational!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|A delightful read. Stevenson is a genius writer. God given gift for all of us to read and reread. I wonder if anybody has ever found the remaining treasure? Time to go look at some old maps, matey!

B002U5HKZ6|4.0|This book has been out for years but I wasn't inspired to read yet another book &#34;set&#34; in India written by a foreigner using the backdrop as a prop. But flipping through the first few pages at a friend's house recently hooked me in totally. It's a very well written, entertaining and moving story. We get glimpses of the protagonist's past life, his inner demons and how the friction of living in Mumbai wears off some of his emotional jagged edges (while adding others). Lin, an escaped convict finds a new life and friends in Mumbai. Forced to live in the slums after losing his money, he becomes one of the Mumbai homeless before being coopted into the mafia.<br />The book does get a bit silly at times..I think those passages are meant to be magical realism but the rest of the tone is so unflinching realistic that the weird encounters like a bear coming to the slum and luncheons hosted by construction workers on a high floor of an unfinished building are just the author indulging himself, and add nothing to the story. The mafia head honcho is rather Bollywood-esque,too- ultra wise, with a commanding presence, and given to spouting philosophical jargon. But overlook the silly stuff. This book is otherwise sound, entertaining and a satisfying read.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I like the movie because it ties in well with the original story.  Well made; great in HD!  Now we just need one to fill in the missing years!
B002N5N4MG|5.0|BBT is such a great show.  I did not have any trouble with the discs, everything played fine on my Blu-ray player.  The packaging was good so nothing was damaged in the mail.  Pleased.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I swear this thing is faster than a pickle sliding on soap and lube. Everything is working fine, so far at least. I mean...Christ this thing is fast....even at 3500 dpi it seems faster than my Razer Deathadder. I doubt anyone will need to use 8000 dpi, but it's just good to have and brag \\"I have a 8000 dpi mouse, and you?\\". I currently have it set at 5000 dpi and you barely need to move/drag the mouse. God this thing is great. Great for playing OSU, fps games, LoL, Starcraft, etc......

B007FEFLTO|3.0|I am a huge fan of Ken Follett's books and will read anything he writes.  However, I found the character development in this book to be lacking.  I found many of the encounters between characters to be predictible, convenient and at the same time unlikely.  I found myself wanting more from this book, but yet I'm still looking forward to book three.

B0075MFS9Y|3.0|One song sounds like the last, gets old fast. The style never seems to change. Like an old barber shop quartet, a song or two and you are looking to change the CD
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Brilliant book. You will constantly be sitting on the edge of your seat for this one! So a boy name  Thomas ends up in a camp full o  boys, no full grown adults. And life goes on as normal until something strange comes from this  box that the \\"creators\\" sen  people and supplies in. That is what ends it. It is then time to find a solution.

B0042MEQVG|5.0|I was late getting on the Twilight wagon but so glad I did.  As the third movie in the series this one is still pretty good.  Usually I think series start to dwindle down on the third movie and any after that just aren't as good.  But was pleasantly surprised to find this movie was just as good as the first two.
B002C6K7NA|5.0|this is like old stuff hope thay do a lot more like this i grew up on them grate album
0060555661|3.0|I bought this book at a bookstore. Although the book is informative and carries some valuable wise words, I felt his strategy to be very dull and outdated. As an investor, I look for good companies at reasonable prices. It is not necessary for the firm to pay out a dividend, as long as it is doing well reinvesting the money into the business. This will add even more shareholder value. I look for companies which are growing fast, which can be bought at a good price. Ben Graham says he doesnt recommend growth stocks, which was a con for this book, given that even Buffett was a growth investor in his early days. Another complaint I have is that Graham doesnt clearly give a way to caluclate a stock's fair value(intrinsic value) except the formula he layed out in the book. From my findings, it is a very flawed and inaccurate way to find out value, even for growth stocks. If you want a more clear way to invest Buffett-Style, I recommend you read ''The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing'' by Pat Dorsey. It is much clearer and up-to-date. Hope I helped.

This book verified for me that all people must have a purpose and meaning for living in order to live up to their full potential.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|There is not much to be said about the Indiana Jones The complete Adventures.......That has has not already been said.....If you love adventure movies....This four Indiana Jones are a must for your movie library...Viewing them in blue ray will be a real treat to your eyes.....Enjoy them....since good adventure movies like these do not seem to come out of Hollywood very often....
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|While Season 1 took the time to get you acquainted with the main characters, it never felt like you had to watch every episode in order, you could jump into the show at any episode.<br /><br />Season 2 however follows a pretty clear story line, and you should watch the episodes in order. Season 2 takes a much more serious tone than the first, and each episode feels very well written and intelligent. The banter between the characters is often very clever, and is a major reason why my wife an I love this show.<br /><br />The only bad thing about Season 2 is that there aren't more episodes to watch, that it eventually ends.
B000EXZI28|5.0|Who does not love the great BEE GEES.....I love this cd.......I listen to it whenever I have a chance to do so....Mostly in the morning while getting ready to go to work.....I hope that you will also enjoy it as much as I do.....
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|It was a very good twist on the plot to the original movie, The Wizard of OZ with Judy Garland.
B005LAIISU|4.0|I really did like Ice Age Continental Drift....However....I think the very first movie of the series....Ice Age....was to my opinion the best of all the others  that came later....But I enjoyed all of them....The first one to my opinion, was the very best one.....
B005OYKIJ0|5.0|The movie stayed true to the orginal, with the fast cars and hot women. The added feature of the Rock getting his a** kicked made the movie even better.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|A cult flick now.  It has a good cast and not too much foreshadowing make it a movie to watch if you like WTF! moments.
B005LAIHCM|3.0|Another movie that reruns the bad boyfriend theme.  How many times are they going to do that?  American films are in a real rut and desperately need refreshing, unique storylines like some of the foreign film makers are doing.  When they DO make a good film often times the stories are borrowed from a successful foreign film, I've noticed.<br /><br />The actors are good in this movie.  They have real talent.  The material is just mundane and inane.  When people are hit in the head with a hammer folks, they don't have clean faces and they don't get up unharmed for scene two.  A little realism here directors, unless you're making a FREDDIE'S NIGHTMARE movie where he can't die no matter what.<br /><br />This movie was just marginal entertainment and I give four stars for the acting, two for the story, which averages out to three stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's very fun adventurous  and really creative and time flies by playing it have fun playing I know I did
B008XG1X18|5.0|it makes it so much easier to access pintrest. i love it. you should definetly download it. if you like pintrest this is the app for you
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|Just received my OZ THE GREAT AND POWER 3D/2D Blu-ray duo disc set from Amazon and it is REGION FREE! It listed as Region A/B/C on the package. Tested both disc on my Panasonic Region A Blu-ray player and both play well! This is the best value set, where you get everything including the extra features, minus the DVD!<br /><br />This represent the best value! Go get it if you like the movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Must have! Minions are adorable, easy to play and very addictive. Family friendly, fun for all ages. Can't wait to play again.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The book is better than the movie.  Had to read all of the books to find out the ending.  Enjoy it.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I love the psy/changling series.  This storyline focus on the psy is long overdue.  I loved reading about Kaleb and his storyline.  This is one that I will read more than once!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved this book so much I couldn't help but think about what it would be like if I was Cassia. I can't wait to get the next book of the series!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Incredibly, his books get better with each new novel. Beautiful writing makes it hard to lay the book down. Now we have to wait for the next book.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I love the depth of the characters and the plot.  It was a great read and I could barely put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The app was a lot of fun and easy to get into. Even if you're not into Despicable Me the app is cute and good fun. Even better: it's free!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This book zeroes in on a very real parental fear: what if my kid really is a sociopath? But though the plot is clever enough, Landay's characters are all flat stereotypes and cliches.  This mystery calls for a kind of realism the author just doesn't achieve.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|what a blast!!! they're cute! they're easy to use! and so many options  for racing! its like that other racing game but waaaay better! i love it!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I FIND IT IS INFORMITIVE TO USE WITH THE MANY NOTES AND DEFFINITIONS,.THAT ARE EASY TO NAVIGATE. THE WORDS OF TRANSLATION ARE COMFORTABLE.
B008QYT7DI|1.0|My review is of the Kindle version... not of the classic itself. Why does this version not work on windows 8? If I cant read it on my device and there is no warning then why cant I get my $10 back? Either fix your software or give me my money back!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Period piece continues to provide complex relationships, plot twists and intrigue with stunning scenery and wardrobes. Tragedy and hope continue to be part of family life.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love it that I can access all the TED talks from my Kindle fire HD. The app has been working well for me without any glitches.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Good acting by entire cast makes for interesting plot and humor for retired spy and his former colleagues and adversaries.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Wasn't sure if I'd like this one but it was spectacular.  The story moved from start to finish seamlessly.  The bad guys got their just deserts.  Wonderful happy ending that satisfied.  A delightful movie and we enjoyed every minute.  Good acting and beautifully presented.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Started slow but I ended up really enjoying this book! The thought of him & Pat together was not my first choice but as you read on you begin to see he cares about her and makes for a happy ending!
B0036TGT3E|5.0|My grandkids are just thrilled to have this movie and it played perfect.  Great to have one copy at our home and one at their house.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Sleep deprived from staying awake reading this. Too bad he can't turn one out every day. Also read The Hit and again can't put it down. Grace
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Awesome to get all the Lethal Weapon movies. Enjoyed the movies when they came out and still enjoy them now. Wanted my teens to watch them with me, and they had fun watching them too. Great collection to have.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It was fun playing but it was hard to exit when you were done playing .Would of been great but
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is by far the best show in years.<br />Pure entertainment. Creative and entertaining. None of the unbelievable junk in the trash shows.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is a very good game you have different mode of play I play random play I don't think I would change anything about the game
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I would rate this book an easy five.........anyone can just pick it up.......but nobody can put it down!!!<br />I love this book and I think u  should definitely give it a try
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great email app for Android devices that is easy to use and allows you to move mail to your folders.
B000ITF86E|5.0|I have never seen  a bad John Wayne movie. This one is especially funny. Any time you get John Wayne and O'hare together it's going to be a good movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|When is the next room opening?  I agree with all of the previous reviews.  Too short, but a truly superior effort.  Sound and control were amazing.  Please get more content out soon.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Dustin Hoffman created a beautifully warm, funny and artful tribute to the arts and life in the sunset years in \\"Quartet\\". Good scripting, delightful actor/artists and leaves you understanding the reflections on one's life. Also important is how the artists found joy and humor in life despite disability and physical/mental adjustments. Nicely done.
B002SZAU1Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and couldnt keep it donw.  It kept me entertained form the first page to the last.  Its not just  astory about romance.  In fact some parts are sad but there are a lot of funny moments.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Suspenseful, love story, drama, and humor. All rolled into one show. A must see, waiting for seasons 4 and 5.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft gets updated to be like the computer version but it gets addicting so look I'm may be a bad good reviewer but it ruined my life my tablet looses such charge to just play I built an extra large car a plane a.......you get the point
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Very good writing with plenty of plot twists and surprises.  Plus some of the best acting on TV.  Highly recommended.
0385349947|5.0|This book is, perhaps, the most important book of the new millenium.  While its focus is women and work, at its heart, this book is about diversity in the workplace and in government.  It should be required reading for everyone.  Anyone in a leadership position, every business student, and certainly every woman and ethnic minority facing these challenges daily in their personal and work lives ought to read this book.<br /><br />What I loved most about the book is Sandberg's willingness to open up about her own life, her own challenges with being a woman in leadership, and her interweaving this with hard data and research.  The studies cited were often jaw dropping, and sometimes, uncomfortably close to challenges I have faced in life and business and continue to face daily.<br /><br />What sets this book apart is that it is not simply a memoir or an op ed piece.  It is based on research and data, something that I think is a key differentiator and a real strength.  Understanding these challenges creates greater opportunity in understanding how to overcome these still well-entrenched behavior patterns.  And sometimes change is not so hard as it seems.  Sometimes it simply requires a shift in how you ask your students to engage in a class environment, or just asking for a parking place, or just sitting at the table.<br /><br />In the end, you may not agree with everything Sheryl has to say, but this book will be eye opening in likely very surprising ways.<br /><br />Every one of you.  Read. This. Book.
B000T46O52|3.0|I had to get this because of my law and ethics class. Its not very good but it does have Denzel in it.
B0014BY72Q|4.0|this is a great buy for the price! the dvd case was in excellent condition and the dvd was non scratched, came wrapped and sealed!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I like the fact that there are no commercials and I can watch on my own schedule and in hd quality.
B00BB3UYS8|2.0|The author tried hard, and I feel sort of bad giving a low star review when it's clear the author put his heart into this. But as a reader, I also have an obligation to fellow readers to say, don't waste your time. The author seems mostly to want to convey his own worldview about everything from space aliens to meditation/Buddhism to the NSA. He has wrapped all his theories into a fictional package that, while it has some good action, is mostly a jumbled mess.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|Been a fan since the first book and after reading dead<br /> ever after still love them. Can't wait for next year
B00BESIKWM|4.0|Though I am usually not a squeal kind of person, this one was not too bad. Scary, Suspenseful, And leads out from the end of the first movie.
B008Y73940|4.0|Matthew McConaughey was born to play this part. His good looks, his swagger, and his vulnerability portray very accurately the Mickey Haller of the book.
B003L77FYS|5.0|In spite of very good episodes in season 4 and 5, i still think that globaly the 3rd was the best. The two part bomb episodes era thrilling,... even if the ending is a bit sad for Castle.
B00C81AVNU|3.0|I wish I liked it more, but there is not enough variety in the song styles/tunes to send me away humming.  Yes, I'm old fashioned.  This would not, however, prevent me from spending Broadway ticket prices to see it live.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The new Jason Bourne &#34;avatar&#34; is very convincing as is the story.<br />And don't believe what big government tells you...
B0064MPXFA|5.0|really enjoyed and can't wait to watch next season to see what happens  and if hubby  gets out of jail
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|A good movie, not great, but on a boring day and nothing else to watch, this movie will give you an hour or so of good entertainment.  Look forward to more Jack Reacher movies with Tom Cruise.
B001O8D47S|5.0|The movie was so well done one was never in the absence of men and they were not missed.  impressive work to create a cast and crew without the usual male domination.  Having worked in the film industry for 20 years this was truly a momumental task and it was well done.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Everything these two do is amazing. If you like Hot Fuzz and Shawn of the Dead hands down you will like this. It may seem like a kids movie but there is a lot of profanity and a few adult situations so be forwarned.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is so much better than the secret. It goes to the depth so simply and gives the tests to do. I would recommend this to everyone thats wants to improve their lives.<br />I am so Grateful I was guided to this book.<br />Thank you Pam
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this story of Eva and Gideon and am so glad its going to continue. Want the next one NOW!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I didn't know my Kindle could do so much. Turns your Kindle into a productive tool.  An be sync-ed to other devices.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|The antagonist knew too much...<br />True to the Langdon arc lots of symbolism- I enjoyed the story - a good read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is truly addiction e as you try to move the coins and prizes towards you. But watch out! Don't lose by sending them over the sides.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|The epic saga finnally comes to a long awaited end.  Brandon Sanderson breathed new life into Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. The ending went as expected and it tied up a lot of loose ends.  T
B00CWY76CC|1.0|No directions, no action. Hard to activate a game without knowing how it works. Sounds interesting but is not. Deleted.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Enjoying with grand -daughter, we compete :) to see who can finish first. We both have the same app. Love all the different puzzles.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is an awesome game it is he best. It is the bomb.subway surfers raised the roof<br />I hope u enjoyed this cause I sure did.
B005SJIP1E|4.0|Mahler is one of those enigmatic composers that some listeners will understand and embrace his brilliance, while others try and try and simply just don't &#34;get&#34; him. My view is that it doesn't matter. This is an inexpensive way to get all of his symphonies...many of which are landmark recordings. Whether you only listen to them once a year, or all the time...this set is a must have for anyone who truly wants to experience classical music to its fullest.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What an amazing story, relatable characters, great writing! I felt so many emotions while reading this book, but mostly I cried. Will definitely be recommending this book with family and friends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its fun. my kids and I loved playing it. ages 6 and 4 :) it looks great to. not cheep looking
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|What ruined this book is the fact that the story didn't end here as promised :-/.<br />It's the O that didn't happen, so close, so good then......whomp whomp whomp  :-(
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Seeing the life of the well heeled, the opulence that they lived in. The character and story development draws you in. It's worth watching just to hear what Dame Maggie Smith will say next.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Used to use it several times a day, was simple and effective. Hate the new look, hate the new app, will uninstall
B005MLOKXA|4.0|It's a good show very clever plot lines. With that said all that needs to be said beyond that is...Julianna Margulies!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I really enjoy this show.  The episodes are beautifully scripted, acted, and filmed.  Benedict  Cumberbatch a and Martin Freeman play wonderfully off each other.  The audio commentaries on the first two episodes are great fun to listen to (if you like that sort of thing, which I do).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|we really enjoyed it.<br />it was fun playing it with my daughter.  she thought the puzzles to solve were cool.
B00AE6SS5O|2.0|How many times are they going to beat this dead horse? Nevosoft just keeps trotting out the same game over and over! Graphics; same. Silly, juvenile story; yes. Oh, brother, I should know better!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE IT! It is worth the money. You should definitely get it! And the new update is AWSOME!! It gives you water lava spawning eggs and other cool things! I play minecraft all the time, and this is better than any other minecraft apps!
0307352153|5.0|This is quite an experience reading about myself and the people around me.  I can better understand my co-workers now.
B001R6G34I|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was a very young pup! Also while growing up the tv stations would show it every thanksgiving and it became a staple during turkey day. Unfortunately it's hardly shown like before. Love Carl, Driscol and Anne, especially Ann!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I loved the storyline and looking forward to reading another Lee Child story.  This is another book that I recommend.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is the Best movie that I watched. The blu-ray edition bring many extra material and a good quality images.
B005544TRQ|5.0|what an awesome show. the quick banter, the actors, you cant go wrong. harvey specter can wear a suit like no other man :)
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|You have the complete collection of Indiana Jones. I enjoyed the adventures of Dr. Jones. The Bonus material are pretty well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you use your brain and think a lot about where and how things go.<br />Awesome game even my son who is 7 loves to play.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I watched in television all this program and I found a good price in Amazon. I recommend if you want to have a piece of the best musical.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It ok takes to long to go far in the game. Wish there were more things to do. Unless you pay real money it takes forever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game s so much fun. You go through this lab in the beginning and you go from there to be come the minion of the year. It's awesome
B00CH26TL8|4.0|NOBODY HATE ON THIS GAME. This game is so fun, and cool.<br />But one thing I dislike, not HATE is the hearts. IT WOULD BE A LOT OF FUN, IF it had no hearts and u can just continue without limits.<br />  OTHER THAN THAT it's Great!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played in a long while. I am glad I downloaded it and I am enjoying it thoroughly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed and finding clues to advance to the next level.  Makes you think and analyse to solve the puzzle.  To bad it only has 10 levels. Beat them in one night.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|can get boring because of the repeated nature of play. needs more variation to keep interest. good for most kids.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book really makes you stop and think about how your actions, or lack thereof, affect other people.  Read it and then tell others to read it.  It will be a book that you won't forget.
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|Great game for kids, not such a great game for adults.<br />It comes off as a good game to get kids thinking about wind directions etc. As an adfult who tried it, it comes off boring.<br />Had no problems loading the game at all.
B00AM1UB06|5.0|I bought a second (Kindle) copy of this book so I could go through it with my son.  it has a lot of good, thought-provoking ideas that are presented in a way that doesn't automatically &#34;turn off&#34; the teenager that you're trying to help.
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|Now I know they have planet games(apps).But this one it's like the titanic that sank 101 years ago.This game is out of sight.It's the perfect app for the kindle fire HD tablet.Now when they say HD they mean HD!!!And who ever made this app.THANK YOU SO SO SO SO VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!Ps I give this app five and I mean 5 big old fat juicy stars!!!!!LOVE THIS GAME<br /><br />  THE END
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|\\"The Impossible\\" is a drama inspired by a real-life family's haunting experience during and after the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster in 2004. What is more interesting about this Spanish film (yes, it is, though shot in English) is that \\"The Impossible\\" (\\"Lo imposible\\") is the sophomore work from director Juan Antonio Bayona known for his supernatural thriller \\"The Orphanage.\\"<br /><br />Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are Maria and Henry Bennett on Christmas vacation in Thailand with three sons Lucas, Thomas and Simon. When the tsunami hits the coast where their hotel is, the Bennett family is separated from one another.<br /><br />Acting is all first-rate. Naomi Watts is impressive (as always) as a mother strong and vulnerable, but the real star is Tom Holland as Lucas, whose spiritual transformation is convincing. The special effects of the tidal waves are amazing and terrifying, much more so than that of Clint Eastwood's \\"Hereafter,\\" in showing how debris in the muddy water can hurt your body.<br /><br />\\"The Impossible\\" lets you know what to expect from the film's simple story pretty early on. Will the Bennett family (based on the Belón Álvarez family) meet each other again? We know the answer, but the film manages to be suspenseful until a certain scene where things look too good to be true. After all, this is a story about the fictional Bennett family, not about Maria Belón Álvarez and her family, or the less fortunate and less privileged. The story is worth telling and told well. The film does very well what it sets out to do, though I cannot help feeling that something is missing here.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This may not be John Grisham's best book but it is a good read. It starts off slowly but picks up speed. His characters are interesting and believable. I read John Grisham's books for enjoyment. This one did not disappoint. The story moves along and does not get bogged down. I would recommend this book to the author's fans and wood be fans.
B00AQTY3XA|3.0|I like Gerard Butler. I like inspirational true stories. I like director Curtis Hanson (though he had to leave the production because of illness. Michael Apted completed the film). I tried to like \\"Chasing Mavericks\\" starring Gerard Butler as Frosty Hesson, a Santa Cruz surfer taking under his wing a young and ambitious surfer Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston), but somehow I felt something is not quite right with the result.<br /><br />\\"Chasing Mavericks\\" follows the story of Jay Moriarity (Jonny Weston), who despite all disadvantages, intends to surf the Mavericks in Northern California, which is one of most dangerous surf spots in the world. Frosty Hesson reluctantly agrees to teach the young surfer.<br /><br />It's a great story. With Gerard Butler and stunning surf scenes, the film could have been much more emotionally involving, but somehow \\"Chasing Mavericks\\" lacks passion those characters should have. Some episodes are rather clichéd (the one involving a dog in the opening is a good example). The mentor/surrogate father-like relationship between the two main characters is not fully explored. Two talented players Elizabeth Shue and Abigail Spencer are wasted.<br /><br />\\"Chasing Mavericks\\" is a decent film with exhilarating surfing sequences, but is still a missed opportunity for a more dramatic bio-pic with an inspirational message.
B00009NQQO|4.0|Cute toy for the money.  Suction stucks well to all surfaces.  My 21 month old approves. Glad I bought it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The only thing that I would like more about this game is not having to pay anything for it as the table version is already taking it out on my pocket.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Its good at finding weak signals.  it Gives you a good impression if your router is on an optimal channel.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Very realistic film about the US Army Bomb Squad in the ongoing wars against the Middle East.  Saying I felt as if I was back in Iraq does not do it justice. Highly recommend this movie.  Superb acting!
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I've been in love with Arnie and the Terminator series ever since I was about 7 when I first saw it. When I saw this, I knew I had to get it. The graphics and sound are amazing!!! Totally better than VHS and DVD. Blu Rays in general are awesome, it's like watching the movie for the first time!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|As a young cancer survivor myself, the topic was obviously of interest. I was drawn to the main characters quickly, and found the story compelling. I had a little trouble believing the author character, but in the end understood what made him tick. Definitely recommend, but keep a box of Kleenex handy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft is a good game its just that it doesn't let me change skins I don't like that
B003R17BV0|5.0|This is a great movie, especially for anyone who likes golf.  The plot would seem too romantic if it wasn't true.  The fact that it is a true story makes the romance very satisfying.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Outstanding artist!  Josh's Music is amazingly soothing and wonderful to listen too. This album is one of my all time favorites.
0525478817|4.0|his book was just lovely. It's the first I've read of Green's so I can't compare it to his previous work. Some reviews have said it's not as good. If that's the case then I can't wait to read more by him because his other books must be amazing. One common criticism of this book is that Hazel and Augustus don't talk like real teenagers. Maybe they don't talk like MOST teenagers but I definitely know a few overly angsty teenagers that talk similarly that I was reminded of while reading this book. It was actually the plot line concerning the author of Hazel's favorite book that I found unrealistic and the reason why this is a four star review instead of five.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Really loved the book so was great to have the movie. They really did a good job making the movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game It is a real challenge level ten was really tricky. this game is a keeper

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and challenges the mind. I love the variety of each floor and the different puzzles to solve.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very easy to read and understand on such a tough subject. Plus Ms. Grout's humor makes reading E-Squared a lot of fun and enjoyable while learning how to use your subconscious mind.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|A lot of bubble popping fun, l would recommend this game to my friends, and share it on facebook to everyone I know.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Every time I'm stuck on a level, I can't give up on the game, I just keep going!!! Very fun this game is and I already influenced three people to try this game out. They all said its a fun game to play and can be pretty addicting too

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Yes, I can with a bit of a challenge as the game progresses. This game is definitely surely a keeper.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE this game it is so much fun. This is better than Temple Run. It is so cute!!! If you get to the end you have to face Vector and his robots.  You have to get this game. If you like the movie then you will love this even more. This game is great for all ages even adults.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4. Each season just keeps getting better. They are all such wonderful actors. Love this so called soap opera set in the 1900's.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It's filled with fun and excitement with the Vector battles and collecting the bananas. I would highly recommend purchasing this app!
B007XGJK4G|5.0|Just so much I didn't know about Bob... This movie gave packed so much information! and it wasn't boring! Must watch even if you don't listen to his music!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|After I started reading I was waiting for the next chapter I never jumped ahead but very well done. I read the book from the guy that talked about how this book stacked up with the bible. Two different books,  all Eban wrote was what he<br />Recalled
B000I9YXHY|5.0|Hello Dolly is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I love it!!  I love the scenery,the songs,the cast,  everything.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The Hempstocks are the fairy god mothers you've always wanted growing up. Or at least I did. Have some tissues handy when you read this. Trust me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wish there were more shows like this! Great character development but not too soap opera-like. Friends said I would love it and I did!
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Steven Wilson, the leader of the great prog band Porcupine Tree and other projects, including Storm Corrosion, the collaboration with long time pal and Opeth master Mikael Akerfeldt, is also one of rock's more prolific artists.  One hopes he doesn't call it a day with Porcupine Tree, but his solo material certainly doesn't lack for its own special beauty and brilliance.<br />  I have not heard \\"Grace For Drowning\\", but if it's Steven Wilson, I'm sure it's great.  I did find a copy of \\"The Raven . .\\" and had already noticed it was receiving more attention and more positive reviews.  I am mesmerized by this album, no easy task for anything of a prog nature, but this is the kind of music that is described as prog only because people insistent on labeling artists can't quite figure out where to categorize it.  Recall the ethereal portions of Pink Floyd and instrumental intricacy of Alan Parsons and you have somewhat of an idea what Wilson's music is like, but only as a scant reference.<br />  So deep is his musical understanding and scope that this album stands alone as a work of astonishing brilliance, beauty and timelessness virtually no other rock artist can do today, maybe with the exception of Akerfeldt.<br />  It starts out rocking with a rumbling bass riff on \\"Luminol\\", but the standout track here is the second one, \\"Drive Home\\", maybe Wilson's most beautiful song ever.  \\"The Watchmaker\\" is a fine longer piece and the title track closes out a set of tunes that put competitors to shame.  While Steven Wilson plays a mean guitar himself, he is wisely averting wanking and overkill, not to mention arrangements too clunky and pointless for their own good.  This is what makes progressive music great or terrible.  Without naming other bands' names, nothing turns me off faster than instrumental noodling.  Make your point on your musicianship, but don't beat me over the head with it.  (The same goes for shred guitarists, too.)  Nobody understands this fine line better than Steven Wilson.  This could be the rock album of the year.  It certainly gets my vote.Steven Wilson.  This could be the rock album of the year.  It certainly gets my vote.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I expected this one to be the culmination of the series but was frustrated that I have to wait for the next book.  This series didn't grab me a first because I had just read the Shades books.  But I believe this has developed the characters better and it has me caught. Again I can't wait for the next book!
B006DGOV9Q|3.0|I don't know how much this will affect the quality of the battery but the one I received had a manufacturer date from over a year ago. I contacted the seller to ask for a newer one but they said that Samsung no longer makes this battery. I have no idea if that's true or not but if I go to the Samsung website, I can order this battery directly from them but it will cost something like $50.
B0074VTHKM|1.0|I really liked his writing but recently he is just putting them out like hot cakes.  The story is about a 13 year old boy and it reads as if a 13 year old wrote it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book! You went on the adventure with the author!  She discovered her truest self and at the same time revealed her doubts, needs, dreams.  She came to understand how strong & self reliant she really is!  For me, I hated when the book ended. A great read
0374533571|5.0|Book is totally awesome.  If you see the movie first, the book helps you to understand the increased intensity that the situation really was.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|What is up with this game? I got it because of all of the five - star reviews, but I should've looked at the one - star reviews first. This dumb game makes no freakin' sense!!! What's the point of it? What are you trying to do (other than trying to push the coins coin the hole)?<br />It's boring as well. All you do is add a coin and wait. Add a coin, wait. Coin. Wait. Coin. Wait. Ooh, we're going to spice it up a little, lets add TWO COINS! Ugh. I mean, they think coins are so exciting. You push a couple of coins down the hole. It suddenly blares at you, DOUBLE COINS! Or TRIPLE COINS!<br />It also has ads. Which sucks. You have to pay a dollar to get rid of them, like most games, which I hate, but I didn't pay. I can live with it, their just annoying.<br />Overall, two thumbs down. If I were an octopus with apposable thumbs, 8 thumbs down. If I were a centipede and all my legs had apposable thumbs, 100 thumbs down. You get the point. I shun you, GameCircus.
B002I9Z8B2|4.0|We were very pleased with this restored version of a Star Trek II version of the Wrath of Khan.<br />When I bought it I did not expect that kind of quality on my HD tv.<br /><br />Pat
B008NW67IQ|5.0|Very innovative with heavy emotional undertones.<br />Heavy rhythms and I really like the incorporation of banjo (not seen that often outside bluegrass).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game tastes so good totes. Luv. It omg lol. Lmao. This game is like a fast food piazza place. I'm 480 pounds
B006PFC2S2|5.0|Yeah, it is a chick flick, but my husband was romantic and loved any movie with a love story. His parents gave him a passion for the classic movies and he introduced them to me. I love this movie more than any other that he introduced me to. Yes, it is a fantasy, but it is the kind of love everyone wants - a person who loves you enough to give up the world for you. I am actually not a big fan of musicals, and wasn't interested in seeing this one, but I was very glad I did. After watching it, I'll be singing and dancing around the house for days even though it makes me kind of sad because it reminds me of my husband.
1451648537|5.0|Just an amazing piece by Walter Isaacson. Simply an incredible man. Definitely a must read!<br /><br />Steve Jobs is missed everyday. RIP.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved it! I would definitely recommend this book. My faith on silver linings has been restored! It illustrates how even when things look horrible, it doesn't always mean they are as bad as they seem!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This ticked many boxes for me. It is fun yet cerebral requiring social awareness and strategic thinking. I've really enjoyed working through the levels and thinking out the most efficient moves.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very exciting and challenging. Makes you think and really use your mind to figure out how to get out of the rooms.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|got it for grandkid's they loved it as much now as my kids did back whin it came out back thin
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|a full chorus of talent....the quartet was beautifully done...one of the better pictures I have seen this year. Hats off to Dustin Hoffman as well as the amazing performances of Smith, Connolly and the rest of the cast,,,
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you like exploring, adventure, building, monsters, and most of all imagination this is the best game for you. It will get boring wants in a while but that just makes it better when a update comes.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not high literature, but a really fun beach read.  Slightly better and definitely darker than the movie. Good book for 14+.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|the book definitely portrays the harsh reality of life on plantations. overall it is a well written, gripping read- at times however, i kept wondering if any happy or positive things were EVER going to happen. the development of Lavinia from an indentured servant to the mistress of tall oaks provides an interesting perspective.
B00BHU261S|5.0|Loved Hopkins, Mirren and Collette in this film.  It was enjoyed by all watching.  Gave an interesting rendition of this producer's life and unusual personality.  Although Hopkins is probably a little more Hopkins than Hitchcock, thems are some pretty big shoes to fill.  The walk-ons and supporting cast were quite fun.  Could perhaps been a bit more memorable, as I watched it just a couple weeks ago and have trouble remembering any fantastical scenes....which there were several.  I'd say 4.75 stars....rounded off to 5.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Wow, so many changes!  I am still reeling from all that happened in this book, don't want to spoil it so I won't say.  I have to allow it to all sink in before I purchase the next book in the series.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Not as extreme, more of a romance story - with a little more information.  Good read though - bring on the next one!
B000JMKNV0|3.0|Too far out.  Looking for an earlier book of his to see if this was only a supposed money maker because of earlier works.
B0060D10I2|5.0|I love this movie...I get a kick out of it. I can relate to this Alice and her problems, I wish I could fall down a rabbit hole and become a stronger version of myself
0345803507|5.0|Love this book, loved the plot as well as the ending.  While some may find it offensive, it is well written.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best ever minecraft pocket edition of the microscope that contains  captainsparklez happy wheels and tires on the
0345803493|5.0|Yes, the subject matter is definitely on the adult side.  I wouldn't let anyone under 18 read it, hot steamy love scenes aside, it's a well written story.
B002RI9YE6|4.0|This is one of the few books I've read where I've become attached to the protagonist. He is a sweet old man who as a butler strived for professional perfection. This drive led to him missing out on much of life and this book is his reflection on his life. He desperately needs confirmation that he actually didn't miss out on much and that his role as butler in a 'great house' during a tense political era played an important part in changing the course of history. As delusional as this is it does give way to some particularly entertaining anecdotes. We all need confirmation that our sacrifices were worth it and didn't go unnoticed and this is what this book so poignantly deals with. This is the second book I've read by this author - Never Let Me Go was the first. He is very good at dealing with emotions and memories without becoming soppy and making you feel as if the characters are biased.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Great movie - you will never forget Boo!  Watch this before and after Monsters U so you can see things you have never noticed before!
B0031RS7MW|1.0|Nothing much happens in this book. The plot is weak and the writing even weaker. It's not as romantic or as charming as it could be. The story is about  a wandering mother and child who end up in a consevartive french town in the midst of lent. The mother sets up a controversial chocolate shop much to the chagrin of the local priest. I really disliked the way the priest was vilified and I think using religion as a source of conflict to further your plot is lazy and unoriginal. This book is about temptation and all you are tempted to do after a few chapters is to ask Amazon for a refund.
1781162646|3.0|Did not read like Stephen King novel and was just okay. Was little disappointed as book was just satisfactory and not that exciting
B005544TRQ|5.0|The script is well written and the development of relationships of the main characters is also well done.  There was a fine eye used in casting this group and it works well.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Great movie, very original - love the storyline and the acting was amazing - I love that german guy he was in inglorious basterds as well
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|\\"What makes you beautiful\\" by One Direction is a good song. I recommend this album because I like the song, the lyrics are pretty good and they put a lot of effort into this album.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|It's like a present for the Jews - they get to kill Hitler and the lot of them - loved the characters and the writing - very suspenseful at times - nice twists - great acting - and very original - I love it - but I am a big fan of Tarantino (don't know if I got the spelling right on that one lol) - there is a lot of violence
B008OTTRXU|4.0|Carly Rae Jepsen seems to be a pretty decent girl. She does curse in one song along with Justin Bieber (why oh why?...), but other than that she's a pretty good girl. I love her song \\"Call me maybe\\". She's got other gold on this CD.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app. What a great way to work your mind. I highly recommend it. Works well on Kindle Fire.
B005NAE04E|4.0|I thought this an intelligent and well-written written fantasy - very imaginative use of the names of London underground features
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|`I need to finish the book to see if all the characters come together.<br />It is beautifully written and readable.<br />A wonderful character study.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I love this movie.  I can't remember how many times I have watched it.  I highly recommend it to Sci-Fi addicts.
B009LXECF6|5.0|I love Bruno Mars! He's one of those artists that will be around for a very long time. This is the second CD I've bought by him and look forward to what else he will do in the future.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book because August was a brave little dude.He went through a lot and even though it was hard he did give and times he wanted to he still didn't. Olivia was a great big sister ,she was always there for her brother and ever stopped helping him witch I thought was great.This was one of my top favorite books. It was amazing!!!
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|This is one of the top selling CDs this year and I do like it. However, the songs are much too long for my listening tastes. I guess I'm easily bored when you keep repeating the same thing over and again during a 3-4 minute span. This is more a dance CD than for listening. If I were in a club I wouldn't mind the length of the tracks.
B00006LLLN|5.0|great tape.  I boutht this for a gift for my husband. Krauss has the most beautiful voice.  we love this tape.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This is not just entertaining, it is also a relevant commentary on the things we place real importance on in our society: the old gods (spirituality, ritual, superstition) versus the new (money, technology, etc.) if you've ever read anything by Neil Postman, there are many correlations.<br /><br />A GREAT read - looking forward to seeing this one brought to life via HBO.
6304712936|5.0|Loved it!! How incredible to have such a masterpiece in my own video library. I can just &#34;Go there' any time I want.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has many features. Who can read it in your own native language.I like the audio version.This app is excellent .
0783226845|5.0|I have loved this movie for years. Every now and then I just like to see it again! It's therapuetic!
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|It is a work that allow you to understand a complex subject like  the development or the underdevelopment of the nations in a very clever and simple way.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am an avid reader and love a good story.  This one has so many twists and turns it is hard to put down.  Can't wait for the rest of the series
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Reminds me of Dota 2 and its mobile. Strictly PvP!!! An awesome game to have and hard to put down.
B004QX07G4|3.0|If you LOVE Ellen, and who doesn't, you will enjoy this book. But, don't expect to be rolling on the floor with milk coming out of your nose.
B001QB5S3G|1.0|I have no doubt this or evenys like this maybe happened but the storyline was lame ad senseless as the acts they depicted. I got sucked in by the quality of actors casted.  I spent most of the movie waiting for it to get better or something interesting to happen but it never did, then everybody dies. RIP. Keep looking.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fantastic game way too much fun perfect for me and my daughter to play.  can play for hours on end.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|After years waiting for a new superman, this was great.  Not cartoonish like the old superman.  Kevin Spacey does a great job of being Lex Luthor and the transition to updating Superman into the modern times was good.
B00ALKO9WE|4.0|Really enjoyed this book- but it doesnt seem to continue after with any sequel which was a bit dissapointing!. Maybe i just cant seem to find the sequel though?
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Awesome story!  Kept my interest throughout.  Couldn't put it down!  Got the book, then got it on my e-reader, and to make sure i could have it even when I couldn't physically read it; I got the audio!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My son lives this jumper! Its great that it grows with him and has lots of activities to keep his attention. Holds up great and easy to clean
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|I remember exactly what I was doing and where I was when JFK was murdered. However, I have always questioned the &#34;commission's&#34; findings, at least what was publically released. They have never jibed with what I believe really happened and what was/wasn't behind JFK's murder and subsequent events that silenced those actually involved. Having the opportunity to gain additional insight into who and what was and wasn't investigated (including the &#34;missing&#34; autopsy data) has solidified my personal belief that there is still much more &#34;behind the scenes&#34; that we as &#34;the public&#34; will never know--not all the parties involved are dead yet. Perhaps someday the whole truth will come to light--hope I'm till alive when that happens.
B007HVBW2A|5.0|Watched it late one night with my 16 y/o who had never seen it. I hadn't seen it in many years. Had the same effect on me as the original viewing. My daughter was impressed. The movie and cinemetography felt appropriate and not at all dated. Great story and gross/ alarming effects. The presence of true evil is well conveyed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This amazing game contains jumping over trains riding<br />in jet packs and more! I love this game and I honestly<br />think that it is better than temple run!
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|It's still in my car weeks after buying it!  This group has filled a void in rock that I've been wanting to hear for a long time.  Enjoy!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|The best: witty, tender, kind, touching, insightful, near perfect directing and for sure splendid acting, fine scripting with almost  perfect dialog...brilliant
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|App did not download. Tried to download it again, and it did not work. Will try again. Maybe it will happen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! It is fun for children of all ages best of all it is FREE!!!This app is awesome I recommend it to everyone thwart looks at it.
B005LFQRTC|4.0|Excellent video. It's like going back in time. We really enjoy the episodes and the action packed dvd.<br />Will get season 2
1442337966|5.0|This IS the &#34;secret&#34;.  I highly recommend. I've listened to a lot of programs over the years. Many of them great. This is by far the most powerful. Get it!  It will change your life. I've purchased several for gifts, now....
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Sings beautifully just as she should being the daughter of the beautiful song bird  Elise lieberth... she has her own special way...love her songs and videos... need more now...<br /> 10 stars if I could
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great love this story and a fun summer read. I can not wait for the next part of the story!!! If you liked 50 shades....this is a great follow up book.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this app cause of the great details and week predictions it gives. Downside, it is sometimes slow to load.
B007HTVHLS|1.0|A rare glimpse of Jeanne Moreau in what might have been extraordinary.  It awaits blu-ray, subtitles worthy of the of the magnificent novel.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|After thoroughly enjoying watching Season 1, I delved into Season 2 with abandon.  Worried that this show, like many others may suffer its &#34;Sophomore Jinx.&#34;  Nope, not to worry.  Still the same masterful plots, great character development, and terrific acting--no wonder this show and its actors have won so many awards!  Still loving it.  Am on to Season 3 by now and just as a teaser--I am loving it too. :)  Enjoy!
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Honestly, I probably wouldn't even be able to tell you if this book was terrible.  It was... the most satisfying read for someone who is a fan of Joe Abercrombie's First Law trilogy.  I imagine it's still a -good- book to those coming to the book without having read the First Law, as the writer has a fantastic handle on his craft.<br /><br />Abercrombie writes tales of bloody battles, shocking and visceral.  He crafts dialogue and character thoughts into something incredibly believable and oh-so-memorable.  His characters are more than flawed.  You can't gloss over them and call them imperfect.  Often his protagonists are genuinely BAD people, no imperfect about it.<br /><br />In Red Country, you get some kind-of not as BAD people.  Good people fallen on bad times?  Maybe.  Maybe more like the bad people of today.  Shy and Temple are intriguing characters.  They're not as marvelous as the cast of The First Law, no, but they also serve as the backsplash for the most memorable character of all.  The decision to never see the inside of Lamb's head is an interesting one, perhaps a little bit of a disappointment for those of us who enjoyed being in it.. but it was the right choice.<br /><br />This is a contained story.  Not an epic with ever-reaching arms.  If I described it to you, it wouldn't be satisfying at all - but it's incredibly worthwhile to read.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I fell into watching this series purely by accident after seeing it offered for free to Prime members. I said I would give one episode a try.  This show is like potato chips--you can't have just one! :)  I HAD to keep watching.  The cliffhangers at the end of each episode are so compelling that you cannot NOT watch.  It is great fun and reminds me of Dynasty from the 80s.  It is campy, but very clever with its writing.  I love the characters and the setting is divine.  Fall into this series.  You won't be disappointed.  (I liked it so much that I was willing to actually pay for the second season!)
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Hmmm!  Well, obviously it's not as good as the first novel in the Kingkiller Chronicles. It also seems a bit ill paced to actually get to the completion of the storyline.  There are some parts that seem really interesting that were glossed over.. some of them seemed to just be a ploy to get the character back to a point where he was penniless and some of them seemed to be a way to build the character without actually building the character. There were parts that should have been glossed over and instead were described in far too much detail.  The sex life of Kvothe is one of the more painful parts of this book.<br /><br />The writing is just exquisite, though.  You really can't beat it.. and the hints at the storyline are enough to make you really still like the book.  There is more great to this book than there is mediocre.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is not your typical &#34;Stand By Your Man&#34; story, so don't be fooled.  I love the plot twists and the masterful acting by the entire cast.  What a treat of a show! And right there on a network! :)  Keep the making this wonderful series.  The best drama I have seen in ages.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|The kids like it, but it's just another climbing car game with not much to make it interesting.  Levels are okay, but I doubt an adult would have the patience for it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book is heart-wrenching from the beginning, especially if you are a parent. Its twists and turns kept me mesmerized! Highly reommended!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I read this after reading The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss.  After reading something wonderful you kind of want to fill the hole that completing it has created - and Blood Song filled the hole for me.<br /><br />I'm surprised that so many amazing fantasy novels are out now.<br /><br />Blood Song starts with a war criminal (or war hero, depending on how you look at it), telling his story of how he came to be imprisoned to a somewhat reluctant scribe.  The protagonist is not perfect like Kvothe of The Name of the Wind.  He has strengths and weaknesses that dictate the way his story moves.<br /><br />The writing is crisp and direct - nothing too flowery here, and the character building is subtle and thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />This is a very nearly perfect book, so skipping it is not an option.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is an amazing eye-opening story.  The characters are real and it is heart-warming and heart-breaking at the same time. It is a novel that stays with you long after you finish reading it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|One of those amazing fantasy books that presents to you a world so completely foreign yet utterly believable.  I really enjoyed this book.  REALLY.  The plot device of knowing how a character got to a certain point but not knowing how has always been intriguing, but paired with the excellent writing style of Patrick Rothfuss?  My goodness!<br /><br />It's a book where you can either run through it, or read as someone looking to analyze since it is incredibly well plotted.<br /><br />Definitely in my top ten fantasy novels. :)
B00AJER3SE|2.0|But the sound quality was a real let down.  The best thing about Blu-rays is the ability to have great sound quality.  The first two Underworld movies and  The Matrix are my benchmarks.  It is nice that they remastered the picture but they left the sound flat.  I cranked it up hoping to knock my house off it's foundation but was barely able to rattle a window.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|A very very cute game that is cuter for all of it's simplicity.  The goal is to get all of your monster pieces into one monster.. bonus points for your monster shape reaching all the little stars on the level screen.  Fun puzzle game for all ages.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun times. thanks for creating these.<br /> pretty challenging but not terribly difficult. would recommend to others.  not great instructions on how to start but once that is figured out it was fun.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Well the game is really fun to play. I love uno but on this game I can't play the game anymore because I don't have any more tokens and I don't buy them so if you buy the tokens then get the game if you don't  buy them don't get the game.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.  I'm sure that dog lovers like myself would especially enjoy it.
0060575816|5.0|this series is still enjoyable years after reading it the first time.  something so poetic in his writing.  his use of words is inspiring.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition) is perfect!  Very satisfied!  You can't even tell where they restored it, wonderful job. -
B004P1JDJO|3.0|Reasonably good.  Author always has a way with explaining and synthesizing data that makes for an easy and entertaining read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this app is amazing. but it would be better with wolves/dogs. obsideon.  and redstone in creative mode.but in total I give it 4 stars
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Really enjoy all the angry bird games, but after 2 weeks it will not load on my kindle or my phone and contacting rovio was a joke!! Now the only way I can play is on the laptop through fb
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is truly a masterpiece. The changing path of an entire way of life is portrayed in such a way that I felt as though I was very much a part of the characters. We catch a glimpse into family life as it once was including individuals from up and down stairs and how they are co-mingled. As we walk in our world today, oftentimes alone as we pursue our individuality, we can see how it was once to be surrounded by others who cared or hated us and get a glimpse into how we are all connected. This shows how a simple word or feeling can be interpreted differently and used for or against another and the emotions of each can be affected turning life positively or negatively. Suffice to say that I like this series on many levels, it has many lessons within it for anyone done with enough drama to make it real. I look forward to the next season
B005OT2YVA|5.0|The plot is as usual, planet in peril, Autobots loosing, brave kid, gorgeous girlfriend, Decepticons loose, hero saves the day
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This worked so well to get weather and now with the new edition it is almost impossible to use without getting ads or google.  I DO NOT know why it does this. I cannot figure it out.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The historical accounts of the last great war in human history, brings current events into perspective, while reflecting on all the pettiness that exist around us.<br />Best zombie story ever told
B006AN78XS|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  The cinematography was beautiful and the acting superb.  Wonderful story.  I can watch this over and over.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Totally destroyed a good app with this unasked for update. Have uninstalled and will be looking for a good replacement.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The complexity and depth of characters is similar to Tolkien's writings. The book and tv series are not exactly aligned, but the book is of course better.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great app, I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a fun game. I usually don't like any apps on here, but this is a good one!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Hello everyone, this is obviously a review for picsart, as the title says.  ┐(￣ヘ￣）┌  I got this app for my kindle fire, and it works well, for the most part. The only set backs of it are that sometimes it glitches making it temporarily inable to use, and the fact tat the color app doesn't always work if there is skin colors or similar shades of a certain color you want to pop. But, overall this is a very good app!　　<br />　　　　　　　　(&quot;⌒&nabla;⌒&quot;)　　　　o(^-^o)(o^-^)o　　(゜o゜)＼(-_-)
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is really different than the computer- hence the name Pocket Edition. I really like this version though, because it has a lot of the same features as the computer, just presented in a different way.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the third book that I have read by this author and I have enjoyed each one more than the last.  He just keeps getting better and better.  The stories which he writes about the Afghan people and how their lives have been irreparably torn apart by the wars in their country are both upsetting and uplifting.  He shows how people manage to hold onto the best in their lives, despite terrible conditions and events which are going on around them.  I feel that it is important for me, an American, to try to understand Muslim culture, which this author portrays so well.  This story is about a brother and sister who are separated when the sister, Pari, is taken to live with another family in Kabel.  Pari's mother has died and her uncle is employed as a driver by a man and his wife who have no children.  The man is much older than his wife and he is quite distant from her.  They have a large house and can give Pari a much better life, which is why her father leaves her there to be raised by them as their daughter.  This, of course, devastates her brother, Abdullah.  His father has remarried a woman and had another child, a half-brother, whom she lives more than him.  Parwana, his second wife, has had a difficult life, caring for her twin sister, Masooma, who was disabled.  Parwans helps Masooma to end her life and her suffering because Masooma just wants Parwana to be happy and not be burdened by her.  This is a very touching part of the story and shows the great live which the sisters have for each other.  Another touching part of the book is the relationship which developes between Nabi and Mr. Wahdati.  After Mr. Wahdati has a stroke, his wife cannot cope with him. She takes Pari and moves to Paris.  She tells Nabi that her husband has always loved Nabi and not her, which shocks him, since Nabi has secretely been in love with her.  They have a relationship, while Nabi cares for Mr. Wahdati, which is quite tender.  Mr. Wahdati encourages Nabi to leave and marry, whilehe is still young, but he feels that he must continue to care for him.  Eventually, his health gets worse and he makes Nabi promise to end his life.<br /><br />These two events and others in the book, seem to show the difficult choices that people make when they love someone.  It seems that the life of an Afghan is both emotionally and physically difficult, but they have a strong sense of loyalty and devotion, which truly amazing.  The book continues and eventually Pari learns of her true past, when her Uncle Nabi dies and leaves a letter with these details.  There is much more to the story, but I don't want to give it all away.  I would highly recommend this book.
1623420148|5.0|This is a romance written by a woman but from a man's point of view and it is truly funny. This is not at all your common romance book.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|worst app ever!it is a waste of any ones time.  time is precious.don't. get this app. i am not kidding
B003FC6WBQ|4.0|If viewers understand that in the time period in which this movie was released divorces were thought to be more negative and totally against social conventions, then the movie makes more sense or at least has a little more impact. The acting of the main characters is great, as always, and the movie was fun to watch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the most well done series I've watched.  Characters are well-played by an outstanding cast in believable story lines.
B009178OQA|5.0|This movie makes one want to go to Jiro's restaurant or to at least eat a lot of good sushi. Jiro is an artist, not just a business man. He is humble and humorous, but I felt a little sorry for his sons who didn't seem to have many choices in life...and for his wife who is only briefly mentioned.<br /><br />This movie taught me so much about making sushi. Who knew that octopus and some fish had to be massaged? And that the fish has to marinate for hours and hours and sometimes days and days. This film was phenomenal in its explanations.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first when I read some reviews saying it was disresectful but in my opinion I didn't see it that way.  It's fun & addicting. It's hilarious when a wave crashes over them  & when you zap the bad guys.  It's decent fun, nothing compared to what kids play these days.  Some levels are a bit hard but others are super easy.  Overall, I think you'll be pleased downloading this game.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I was hesitant to read this book; however, when my book club selected it I had to acquiesce and am very glad I did.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|The resolution doesn't seem as good as other copies of the films.  I also miss all of the special features
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I could not put it down.  I love this author! Magically written and engrossing.  Such a talent! Highly recommended to book clubs.
B005PWPUW6|4.0|i bought it to connect my apple tv to my a/v stereo amplifier. i haven't yet  tried it , when i do i will tell you how it works
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The entire Fifty Shades Trilogy was a surprise and delight. I knew very little about the Fifties when I started reading them except they were very sexual. I was pleasantly surprised because the story grew into a wonderful love story that proves love can help people grow and overcome their fears. I would recommended the Fifties to anyone who wants to be titillated both physically and mentally.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I know Hans Zimmer is good but he out did himself with this soundtrack.  I loved it.  Even my wife who is not a soundtrack lover, loved it.  I recommended to all.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This is a good funny film to see with friends and family.  I highly recommend this light hearted comedy/zombie movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun, and it is free! I would highly recommend this game to gamers of every age.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|It is interesting to see how live and love plays out.  The beginnings, the trials and the years that pass by but LOVE wins in this story.  I love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is such a good game to play. it will keep you busy and is very addictive I just love this game and the power ups are awesome I just cant get past victor but other than that I love it
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We purchased this just before our family vacation and found ourselves playing it nearly every night.<br />I love the strategy and thought that's involved like Risk but the fact that I won't be up all night trying to finish a game.  1 hour to 1.5 hours each game.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My cousin told me that this game was the best! So I downloaded it... And now I love it! It's has lots of action and is just so amazing!!<br />Buy it!! You'll love it too.
B005HED08I|5.0|Nice improvements keeping with its 60ties style. I shouldn't have to comment on the story line. If you don't know this classic TV show then you aren't a lover of Sci-Fi shows. This is what inspired all sci-fi movies of our generation.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Awesome game, great way to pass the time in the airport if you have wifi. I highly recommend this game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It's free, it's classic, it's awesome! A good read when there is nothing else to read. Reminds me of my childhood.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|She the Wii an dj web act web ci well cop who dJ who sho think cop Emil once bmp e.g. I do dj vS k
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love period dramas and this one is so well done. All the characters are well developed and the plot has never ending twists .
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is not so much a game but a sit back and help from the sidelines. But that doesn't mean its bad. This app is a game that involves strategy and lots of it, but you have to be smart about it. I have to say i was extremely sceptical about  getting this app. Learn from my mistake and get it. Advice for fungus lay low and infect all humans then when you get that message that says all humans infected... release hell. Will work. And after you do... watch the world CRUMBLE!!!
B000002UTI|5.0|I bought the cd for the darling boy song. My son and I have it down pat. it is sad john did not get the same joy I get from singing it with his son
B005HED11Y|5.0|Given the context of the 60’s, the frenetic heap of the recent movies, the original series still shines. 1st time I have watched in probably 20 years- still good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|my wife and son had a very hard time only watching 2 a day. Most of the time its was 3 a day.. now what are the going to watch?
B005K17RU0|1.0|No download - so no review - can't review what you don't have.  I'll try again when I am to a faster service.  By the way - 1/2 od the US has lousy service, while city/suburban folks have speed to burn.  .78mbs
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|The movie was too slow ant I had a hard time keeping up with the characters over the many time zones. I am glad I saw it on Amazon and not in the movies.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|My wife and I have been sucked in to watching this series. And the fact that their is no commercials, makes it even better!
0684106892|2.0|I received my Knitting Without Tears today and was so excited because of all the great reviews.  Even when I googled &#34;Best knitting books for beginners&#34; this book was at the top of everyone's list!  I don't know why because I didn't understand a lot of what I read.  While I appreciate Elizabeth Zimmerman's wit and great knowledge of knitting, I just couldn't get in to the instructions.  I have been knitting for over a year and still consider myself to be a novice and this book won't help me at all.  I am sad to give a low rating since Zimmerman is so beloved in the knitting community, but this book won't help beginners.  Have also ordered the Vogue knitting book, hopefully that one will be easier to follow.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|...even my I'll-leave-the-room wife came around to thinking it was a good movie. The true story aspect helped us get over a couple of thin spots in the plot.
B000XXGMS8|4.0|Only had them for about two weeks but I'm happy with them. These run about 1 size too large, so order 1 size smaller than you would normally wear. The tread is great, which means they can be a pain to clean from mud but that's expected. Very comfortable after a week's break-in time. Love the style as well.<br /><br />My only reservation is that the stitching, especially on the toes, won't muster prolonged wear. I purchased these for casual use, some hiking and to use while riding a motorcycle so with lots of shifting I expect those stitches will wear out sooner than the rest of the boot.
B00358ESI4|5.0|A film that plays well with Mel Gibsons acting style. The characters were very good and the cinematography was an important piece to the film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Thai game is Challenging and fun! But I Wish there were more levels though. I will be waiting for more.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Wonderful movie that our whole family enjoyed about overcoming the burdens of our past and finding the true hero inside of us -as well as learning about self-acceptance and self-worth. I highly recommend this movie.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|enjoying the game but wish free hearts would reload quicker.  I think that this is a game my whole family will enjoy
B000J6I0VG|5.0|My family really enjoyed this movie. A clever and entertaining story line with suspense and humor where the underdogs truly come out on top and a group of unlikely friends bond together and even enemies find acceptance.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game.  Can not wait for more levels!  Enjoy figuring out the clues and passwords.  My kids will love this.
B0026772N8|4.0|The philosophy was stimulating and his thought process interesting.  His ability<br />to interact with others (particularly his son) was problematic.<br />Worth reading
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Second book in the series in 4 dAys and downloading the 3rd. I really enjoy this series and can't put them down!
B00406O7YK|5.0|Hello Dolly! is one of the best musicals ever produced in my opinion.  It never drags and the songs are so good you will soon be singing along.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this because it helps me how to play and what to do and when to say uno on the last card and when I don't have it the same card like number or color and I said oh man I don't have the same card so I liked it out from the pile finally I had the same card
B006VREHRS|5.0|This is a rough, realistic, highly violent and corrupt representation of how our local, and other governments ate actually operated. The movie is well done. The subject matter is an unfortunate reflection of life in the 1920's and perhaps a window into how things are done now.
B00AAI7B7W|4.0|Good movie....streamed free with Amazon Prime<br /><br />The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the extended cut is better and fills in the gaps
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Really good read for all Halo fans! Really expands on the whole world of Halo and gets the reader a whole new experience.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love this movie. I have watched it several times for free with my Prime membership. I would watch it again.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland's first season keeps you on the edge of your seat and questioning what your Government is keeping from you.  Claire Danes is neurotic perfection and deserves all of the awards and esteem offered for her performance as Carrie Mathison.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Enjoy playing and the artwork of the characters is outstanding.  Big Fish puts out a great game.  Love it.  Would like to recommend that better instructions are given about he various helps in the game.  Overall -  Love, Love, Love it.  Thanks.  Sandy S
B00846REIS|4.0|Just as good as fifty shades of gray. Just as hot and true for a love story.<br />If you loved fifty shades, you will love this.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just awesome...I couldn't stop reading.it kept me intrigued and now can't wait for the next one.  I read the first three in less than a week!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A fast paced and sexy read. Finally getting to the heart of Eva and Gideon. Looking forward to book 4. Hurry please.
B00284BMBM|5.0|It's a great album, i received it super fast and it's a pretty reasonable price :-) that's all I can ask for!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I gave the television show &#34;Suits&#34; the highest rating because it is never boring and always entertaining. The characters are intelligent but they also make mistakes which they recover from. I also like to see good win in the end. Evil does well sometimes but good wins. I think the show is great!
0767805712|4.0|The story illustrates the possible dangers of science through genetic manipulation using an interesting story line and good-looking actors.  I show it in my high school class.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME!!!<br />I really like Temple run 2 and suggest that you get it.<br />It is a great game and you don't get ripped off<br />I really suggest that you get it.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|You can't beat this show for fun, laughs and clever humor.  Every season is as good as the next.  Watch them all!!!
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|I love this game. Some levels are challenging but most are easy and cool. I totally recommend this app. YaaaAayyyyyyyy
B0069UP2PI|5.0|Good, scary story about a fast spreading bug.  Very timely, entertaining, and a fast-paced story - great for my biology class.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is great. But it is not like minecraft on xbox or pc because it does not have portals or potions or any exciting things like that. Otherwise it is a great app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everyone loves this show.  It's so fun to watch together and discuss with friends and co-workers the next day.  It's a phenomenon.  Oh Matthew!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Love the new music. He's still rockin it out ! Been a huge fan since '74 and he keeps putting it out there
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I don't care what season it is, this show is so funny! Have never seen anything like it.  Watched the DVD's from day 1 to present and still can't get enough.  I feel like I know the characters personally. Very clever writing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app a year or two ago and LOVED IT!!!! But then they made the new update and up first it was awesome then I discovered the awefull lagggggggg! but other than that amazeing
B005LAIGPA|4.0|Something totally different.  Made me laugh and shocked me at times.  Parts were really funny and well done, but as a high school teacher I found much of the teen dialog completely phony and stiff.
B00CFITJKW|1.0|All I can say is crapy at first I though it would be awesome but it is not worth the 5 dollars. If only I could give a 1/2 star!
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I love movies that are well done about kids plotting capers and being the reasonable ones while the adults are basically idiots.  This is a movie where you really don't foresee where the movie is going but you take a delightful, humorous journey getting there.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Great app with awesome graphics good sound and it is challenging. And the controls are easy to use. I would give it 6 stars if it would let me!
B009FZHYKU|3.0|My son made me watch this series.  I fell for it hard, even though I have had nightmares about zombies.  Unfortunately, the first half of season 4 has many episodes that are dull and boring.  You will miss the excitement of the past seasons, but hopefully season 4 comes in and goes out with a bang!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! I got it forever ago and got hooked on it. I am a level 22 and climbing.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book will bring you closer to another person's journey in dealing with life and loss and family and discovery of who you really are.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|a good game to play when u r bord out of your mind.and a good time waister 4 a road trip
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|I've been a fan of Sophie kinsella's for a while, and this one is a bit different from her normal books.  I really liked the story and the writing and plot is really fun-great summer read!
B002VUFKG6|4.0|I really liked this book but at times it felt a bit rambly. I would sometimes skip over entire paragraphs because she wasn't saying much. But the study on marriage was thought provoking and made me think a lot about my own hesitations to marry.
