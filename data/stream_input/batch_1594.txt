B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I didn't read this book because, first of all, it's by a foreign writer.  Call me whatever you want, I just don't read books by foreign writers.  Even when everyone was saying how wonderful it was, I just couldn't make myself read it.  I read the reviews and the synopsis and it just didn't seem like something in which I'd be interested.  Then came the movie and my niece telling me how much they enjoyed it. So I broke down and gave it a try.  What a waste of my time.  All I could think of when the movie was over was - well - I certainly could have done without that.  How depressing.
B0012GMYUU|5.0|When I was a kid Jeff Beck was a guitar hero -- the flashiest guy around. When he turned to fusion I stopped listening because at the time I was a very loyal fan of acoustic jazz and resented the advent of jazz rock - which sounded like cop show music to me anyway. Now, decades later, with the prejudices of youth behind me, I have rediscovered Jeff. He really is a fabulous instrumentalist with a delightful flamboyance and an agreeable fondness for melody. Now, the ugly truth is that I just purchased this album and haven't received it yet so the only tracks I know are the ones on YouTube, but they are all great. There is one that I am particularly anxious to own, which is the version of Rollin and Tumblin with Imogene Heap. Rollin and Tumblin is a traditional up-tempo blues; I think it's sometimes credited to Muddy Waters. Cream did a cover version as did many other bands, I'm sure, back in the heyday of blues rock. It has a very catchy riff; possibly Eric Clapton came up with it starting from a traditional phrase. Jeff figured out a great way to play the riff and has turned the song into a really irresistable vocal/instrumental showpiece. Now, what is wonderful about Imogene Heap is that she is not someone you would expect to be singing a Muddy Waters song. She's into electronica and experimental stuff. But she has a great, powerful voice and an instinctive feel for the throb and urgency of an up-tempo blues. Her singing is at once surrealistic and traditional, inside and outside the tradition at once. Not many vocalists can pull that off. Many would try to imitate an old-time blues singer or else abandon the blues flavor entirely (that's how I picture Patricia Barber approaching the task). But Heap makes the tradition her modeling clay. Of course this is also true of Jeff's guitar playing -- he merges the song's antique bluesey feel with his exotic, futuristic flights (his sound often reminds me of a rocket taking off.) So the two of them make a good pair. At firstI thought Jeff's sucession of female collaborators - including Heap, Imelda May, Jennifer Batten, Joss Stone, and bassists Tal Wilkenfeld and Rhonda Smith - was a gimmick. But in each case he comes up with an original and intriguing cross-breeding of styles. Perhaps gender doesn't matter with the non-singers. Still, there's a chemistry there that's important given that guitar rock tends to be a guy-thing. I am really impressed by his good judgment in finding collaborators. To me, Eric Clapton will always be the ultimate blues guitarist from Cream via John Mayall, and Jimmy Page will always be Led Zep. Jeff Beck is the only one of the three ex-Yardbirds whose current stuff eclipses his youthful exploits. While EC tries his hand at 'Autumn Leaves' Jeff Beck is still frolicking in the bursting buds of Spring.

1419702238|4.0|This book review is written by Brianna C. Moore (age 10)<br /><br />I liked the book because at the beginning of the book it deals with bullying situations that happen at school and how to tell your teacher and tell your parents if this happen to you. Greg received a present from his parents and it was a doll named Baby Alfrendo. At first Greg didn't want the doll, but after he got used to the idea of having the doll he started to feed the doll, he took it on walks, and then when they went on one of the walks he lost his Alfrendo doll. Greg, also steals cupcakes from the cupcake club, and everytime he sees a cop he gets scared and runs away because he thinks the cops are after him. He also kept his secret santa gift for himself and played with it until it broke and then asked his mom to bring in something else. There were things Greg did that were wrong and he knew it, but there were other people that were making mistakes like vandalism that wasn't Greg. So, to end my review of this book, I thought it was well written and funny for age, and I can't wait to read The Third Wheel.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|I appreciate the book. The story is interesting, the relationship between Christian Grey and young and unexperienced Anastasia. I enjoyed reading the witty e-mails they send to each other .<br />However, I would hardly compare this book to other BDSM novels (I'm French, so I think about authors such as Sade or Pauline Réage). The story is too romantic. For what I've read of the other two books, I'm not sure I'll buy them. The end can too easily be foreseen.<br /><br />To sum up : It was a pleasant book this summer by the pool... On my Kindle, of course.

B005OK721G|3.0|\\"Colombiana\\" is a typical case of action flick that starts with the logo of EuropaCorp, a French studio co-founded by Luc Besson. The film, which stars Zoe Saldana (\\"Avatar\\") as a deadly assassin, is yet another Luc Besson's collaboration with writer Robert Mark Kamen, a team that gave us such films as \\"The Transporter\\" and \\"Taken,\\" but several elements in the story may remind us of Besson's earlier films like \\"Nikita\\" and \\"Léon.\\" (It is reported that \\"Colombiana\\" was originally conceived as a sequel to \\"Léon,\\" which I don't think is a great idea.) What you get instead is \\"Colombiana,\\" a decent action flick in which Zoe Saldana delivers a strong action-heroine performance, even though the film itself leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />In \\"Colombiana\\" Zoe Saldana plays Cataleya, who as a 10-year-old child saw her own parents killed in Bogota, Colombia. Raised by her gangster uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) in Chicago, Cataleya works for him as a professional assassin, while attempting to track down those who are responsible for her parents' deaths. Cataleya also falls in love with a man named Danny (Michael Vartan), who doesn't know Cataleya's true identity.<br /><br />\\"Colombiana\\" is directed by Olivier Megaton, known for \\"Transporter 3,\\" the weakest entry in the Jason Statham franchise. I admit the film's action sequences of \\"Colombiana\\" are not bad, especially in the film's opening section, though they are undermined by the director's hectic camerawork and editing. Zoe Saldana did a great job as an efficient killer whose MO includes several unique items, but most supporting players are wasted in forgettable roles, with an exception of Amandla Stenberg, who played a 10-year-old Cat very effectively.<br /><br />\\"Colombiana\\" is a slick B action thriller with talented Zoe Saldana.
B006YMMFT2|5.0|100% worth it. Loved it. Visually spectacular! Graphics were amazing. The movie went right into the action exciting from start to finish. I had my doubts about picture quality but the picture was great on Amazon Video.
B007V508CC|5.0|Is it [[ASIN:B0085LETCG Songs About Jane: 10th Anniversary Edition]]? No, but then [[ASIN:B001ANE3EA It Won't Be Soon Before Long [CD/DVD] [Deluxe Edition]]] wasn't either - that was a massively slick and poppy album and I adored it. So why was I reading all of these negative reviews that kept me from buying it as soon as it came out? Maybe I was worried with Jesse's departure, they had gone off the deep end like all the reviews were making it out to be. Overexposed belongs in the same catalog with all of their previous albums. Maroon 5 has from the start been the band with the stellar hooks, extremely catchy, get under your skin and stuck in your head. They've also become very known for upbeat, fast songs with more depressing lyrics - this hasn't changed either, so I'm lost where people think this has strayed so far from their formula? The main drive of Maroon 5 has always, ALWAYS, been Adam's amazing vocal ability with Jesse's keyboards a very close second. I've listed to it only once and the majority of the songs have caught my attention on the first listen, so I know with repeated listens this will easily overtake [[ASIN:B005A68HRC Hands All Over (Amazon MP3 Deluxe Exclusive Version)]] to be up there with SAJ and IWBSBL.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|If I could give this book 100 stars I would... I can not give a review that is worthy of this book. I read this book in hours- very easy and short read but worth it! I cried, I laughed (out loud), and fell in love with a new fictional boyfriend all in one book!<br /><br />I lost my father when I was 17 similar to the lead in the book (Lake- which I love her name). I identified with her and cried for her while reading the book. Her family went through so much and I was hoping for a happy ending. My mouth dropped open and the tears came down when she discovered her mother's secret.<br /><br />I was so glad that Will was there for Lake from day 1. Even with their unfortunate circumstances which lead them not to be together they still wanted each other and fell in love. He was her rock and I have a feeling will continue to be for book 2, which I also think she was his rock too, a rock he didn't know he needed until her.<br /><br />I loved the sweet young brothers in the book who made me laugh :) As well as her friend Eddie, where can I get a best friend like that? The poetry was amazing in this book and the ending- after that how can you not like poetry?<br /><br />The only complaint would be I was it had more of an adult undertone. I understand it is YA and I knew that going in so it is not the author's fault of the writing, it's just what I like. I hope the second book grows up as the characters continue to grow and are in more adult settings. I already bought book 2 and starting it tonight!<br /><br />[...]
B0038M2RL2|3.0|Storywise, this really isn't much of a film, but it is still enjoyable.  As a matter of fact, the best part is the carryover at the beginning from the first Karate Kid movie, extending from the karate tournament to the parking lot where Miyagi and Kreese have it out.  The rest of the second film is devoted to a trip to Okinawa where Miyagi meets up with an old friend from his past, who now wants to kill him, and Daniel falls in love again.  Much of the film is devoted to settling old guilts and rekindling old feelings, but it is basically a wash.  The final confrontation between Daniel and a local bully hearken back to the first film, but I still can't buy that skinny Daniel could take on and win over the more experienced fighters he battles.  (Note: Don't go looking for exotic sights of Okinawa; it was filmed in Oahu, Hawaii.)<br /><br />I found the first film to be much better because it really dealt with the problems of Daniel that many of us can identify with.  The second film was really Pat Morita's film.<br /><br />Video is quite good in places, but soft in others (especially in footage from the first film).<br /><br />Audio is excellent.<br /><br />Extras consist of a trivia track, which only pops up once in a while, and a very short \\"making of\\" featurette (in SD) from when the film was released.

6305897786|5.0|The movie starts with a man committing suicide and he is the one who sold a version of the book to the wealthy book collector. A book dealer is asked to inspect a rare book to verify its authenticity for its owner. The wealthy book collector, Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) shows Corso his book collection focused on the devil and his prize book is The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, printed in Venice in 1666.<br /><br />Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) tells the owner that two other copies exist but only one is the original version. The original book was supposedly written by Satan and it contains nine engravings that will summon Satan himself. Corso accepts the job but he should not be trusted. He will lie and cheat to buy rare books at a fraction of their real value. Corso travels to Europe to speak to the other owners and look at their books and try to purchase them and at least get to look at them.<br /><br />Corso is authorized to buy the real book at any and all costs, even if illegal. Balkan gives Corso a large check to finance his trip and time. Corso's trip proves both to be enlightening and suspenseful. He is seduced, attacked and his friend is murdered in a ritualistic way as depicted in the book.<br /><br />This is a creepy and suspenseful story. Not each book is identical and perhaps it takes all three to summon Satan. Corso's mission is the basis for the movie and it presents a very good storyline. The acting in the film is outstanding. This really is not a horror film but more of a film about the occult and the beliefs in the devil. It is a deep and dark film that keeps you guessing until the very end.<br /><br />If you like scary and dark drama films then this is a good one for you to watch. There are no monsters or special effects; it is just a spooky story about raising the devil.

B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This is simple and cute where the objective is to cut the strands of the spider's web and free the insects.  This is a puzzle game with you against the spiders.  You gain other tools like the ability to freeze the spider but there can also be multiple spiders.  You can freeze each one but you still have to have a good strategy and they move quickly and they work in teams.  As the webs get bigger you can pan and zoom if you need to see more detail.<br /><br />The graphics are good and the audio is OK.  The music is OK and the bugs make cute sounds when they are in danger.  The game is challenging and fun.  There is a hint button but it takes coins to use it.  I quickly earned coins and had enough but I didn't use the hint button as I liked the challenge.<br /><br />Settings are simple; they are either Easy or Hard.  The game has four level groups, Aztec Bait with 36 levels, Deep Fear, Hunting, and an Abducted group. Overall there are 144 levels in the game that should keep you busy for a while.  I could find no spyware or data mining in the game. The game has played perfectly on my Kindle Fire without any issues.<br /><br />This is a 5 star game as it is cute and challenging.  I have listed some Cons below that can easily be fixed by the developer that would make me a lot happier.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Fake reviews to start the day.  One even used his real name and he is one of the developers.  You don't need to do this as it is just a turn off for many people.  You should remove your own reviews as they are against Amazon regulations and rules and it is really unethical.<br />* The game stores itself into your Kindle Fire memory reserved for books and other personal data.  I don't like this as Amazon has reserved memory space for apps so they don't interfere with your other data.  That memory is where this game should be stored. The game uses 19.783 MB of data in the book location and 1.67 MB in the app storage location.<br />* The app has a link to You Tube to show you a cute intro video.  I don't like YouTube access for children as there is just too much on YouTube that is dangerous or done in poor taste.<br /><br />The plus symbol does:<br />* Information<br />* The film strip takes you to a very short video on YouTube.<br />* Facebook - if you post you get five extra coins.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />Network Communications - full internet access<br />Network Communication - view network stateow you a cute intro video.

B004ZZFMTK|5.0|I am sure that because of Julia Child's books, grocery stores began stocking more of the hard-to-find ingredients we take for granted today.  I learned to cook from these books because of the easy to understand layout.  The results were splendid.  We'd have company for dinner almost every weekend; and our fussy-eater children would sneak into the kitchen to devour the leftovers.<br /><br />When they grew up, the kids wanted copies of the books too, and they became fine cooks.  Recently, one of our daughters had to move a great distance, being forced to leave her things behind in storage.  When she moaned about having no \\"Julia\\" with her, I bought the Kindle version (I had bought her a Kindle for her birthday), and she had her cookbook instantly.  I love Julia, I love Kindle, and I love my daughter.  Thanks, Amazon!

B00136LZG8|5.0|Abraxas is just one of those late sixties, early seventies albums that really resonated with me.  It is my favorite Santana album and just one of those albums I play beginning to end and never get tired of it.  It is a great combination of heavy latin rock, pop hits with great hooks, awesome guitar work all interlaced with powerful latin rhythms.  The mastering of this album is really clean and the sound has a lot of depth.  The original gatefold lp came with a really nice poster of the band.  I miss those days of big album art and goodies inside the album cover but the instant gratification of downloading whatever you want in just a few minutes is pretty cool.

B002S0OBMS|5.0|I loved the Phantom of the Opera, the music and everything. This time, Love Never Dies is not a movie type, more like a play which makes things in a different way of view. Is not the same as the phantom, but I like it. Perhaps this time the phantom shows more love at the end, knowing he has a son. I gave 5 points, because everything was beautiful and because was good for my taste.

0345522478|3.0|There is a lot to like in this series, but the weaknesses are distracting.  This is the best in the series -- the third was pretty awful.  I am sort of slogging through the fourth.<br /><br />The pros -- interesting take on Celtic mythology, easy writing style, generally likable characters.  At times, very funny.<br /><br />The cons -- lots and lots of filler material.  More in later books, but some in the first.  Examples would be descriptions of the town that are more detailed than of some of the characters.  I get it, you are a native! I am not and it gets tiresome at a point.  As the series goes on, the long educational passages seem less and less a part of the story --by the fourth book, I am seriously feeling lectured.  It felt like the author had to add content.<br /><br />The humor is often, well, juvenile.  I think that the author is going for witty or cynical or something, but Atticus (as other reviewers have noted) has nothing character-wise that indicates a life-time of experience, let alone multiple lifetimes of experiences.  He is more frat-boy than sage.  The effort to be hip and current is a bit strained.  I liked Oberon and I understand the purpose of having him in the story for expositional purposes, but the back and forth between dog and not-dog mentality was jarring.  Oberon became less and less of a character and more of a device ... which seemed clumsy.<br /><br />By the fourth book, the author is getting seriously preachy.  I understand that a Druid would be Eco-friendly, but the political point of view gets more and more prevalent.  Atticus sounds less and less like an ancient observer of human nature and more and more like a modern Birkenstock-wearing, Prius-driving, granola-munching liberal.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it isn't very interesting.<br /><br />The series starts off stronger than it is concluding, alas.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I've never ventured into this realm of reading, but I kept hearing friends and strangers talking about it. I was ever so curious and a little nervous about buying this book, but I'm so glad I did. It was a great read and I've just purchased the second book of the trilogy.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|This movie was flat out BORING! It dragged on for far too long before the action began, which was also BORING, but somewhat less so. Some people, including myself, would see this boring too long beginning as time used to develop characters in the movie. It succeeded in doing so for the main character, whatever her name is. As for the rest of the characters, it did a poor job.<br /><br />I don't want to characterize this as a bad movie, it wasn't. It was just BORING!
B007SGM084|5.0|What a great read! It was so easy to go online and order the book, instead of going into the book store.  I'm already on the second book, it's so good that I can't put the book down.
0596009208|2.0|I have programmed before, so it wasn't much of a problem, but this book didn't explain anything about basic sytax, how programming works, or even what a variable was. It was almost like the book expected that you had extensive experience in another programming language such as c++. It barley explained the idea of OO programming before diving in \\"head first\\"<br /><br />At the same time, the book frustrated me. After skipping the basics it went very slowly. Basically, it acted like you knew all the basics of programming at the start and then like you were a complete beginner latter. I wish it was more fact than all this fluff. Fluff would be good for a beginners book, which we already established this isn't, and so it really serves no purpose. Over all, I am disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />I would rate one star, but at the end of the book I had an idea of the basics of Java, which is what I bought it for.

1451627297|4.0|Jake Epping is a recently divorced teacher from Lisbon Falls, Maine, having an ordinary night grading papers for his adult GED class that he has picked up for some extra money.  The assignment is \\"A Day that Changed Your Life\\" and everything is seemingly normal until he comes to the school janitor, Harry Dunning, whose paper who describes how on Halloween 1958 his father came in a drunken stupor and murdered everyone in his family with a hammer.  Jake, a man who is normally emotionally neutral is deeply effected by the story. After the GED graduation Jake takes Harry for a Fat Burger at Al Templeton's burger joint and they become friends. Little did Jake know, this story would change his life.<br /><br />It is now the last day of school in 2011 Al calls Jake out of the blue and asks him to come to the burger joint as quickly as possible.  Upon arriving Jake finds Al dying of lung cancer even though just the day before he had been healthy, and this is where the story begins.  Al goes on to explain that he has found a time slip that takes that back to Lisbon Falls as it was on September 9th, 1958 at 11:58am.  Jake does not believe him until Al takes him downstairs and sends Jake back to go have a root beer and see for himself.  Jake is skeptical at first until his foot steps on a stair that is really not there and walks up into the past.  Before leaving Al tells him of the Yellow Card Man, who is always there, waiting.  The one oddity in a land of constants.  When he Jake returns, two minutes after he leaves (it is always only two minutes later) from that initial trip Al goes on to explain what he was trying to do back in time.  Save the life of JFK! Al believe that by saving him he might stop Vietnam from starting, saving millions of lives. Against his better judgement he decides to go back and see what he can do. In his second trip he adopts the alias of George Amberson, and sets up residence in Derry, Maine and follows Harry's father around trying to figure out what to do to fulfill his vow to save Harry Dunning's family. He almost succeeds in saving them all, but the oldest still dies.<br /><br />When he returns, Jake tracks down Harry's sister and calls her.  He discovers that Harry was drafted and dies in Vietnam. Jake does not want to go back for a third time, and plans to tell Al the next morning, but upon returning to the house, he finds Al dead from an overdose, the pain of the cancer too much for him. Against his better judgement Jake goes back to do it all over and this time, save JFK and try to save Harry.  What is in store as a man, who is from 2011 has to live for five years during the 1950s and 1960s? If he is able to save JFK, what is he going to return to find?<br /><br />This is the latest Stephen King novel published November 8th, 2011 weighs in at 849 pages is not a light read but this is a page turner after you get past the somewhat slow beginning of the book. King is primarily known as a superb horror author but his slant on alternate history is exciting and just as great as any of his previous books. King originally tried writing this book back in the 70s but abandoned the project after 20 or so pages, feeling it was still too soon to write a novel about JFK.  As typical of a King novel he develops the characters in a manner that you truly grow attached to them, almost as if you are bonded to them.  The plot goes nice and steady, keeping you want to read the next page and chapter, something amazing for a book of this length.  I found the draggy parts to be very few and far between, keeping everything flowing nicely.  I did find it odd reading an alternate history books from a guy who is known as the king of horror, but the fact that is was not a horror book does not detract from his superb writing style.  He keeps you enthralled, making it until you have to pass out with the book in your hard.  I had many a late night in bed reading this book, with the \\"one more page\\" syndrome until I would just pass outreading.<br /><br />I am primarily a sci-fi, fantasy, and mystery buff but this book easily appealed to me as a reader, I am not sure that King could write a bad book, maybe bad for him, but not in general compared to other authors.  Anyone who enjoys a good solid book and wants to invest some time into it, this is the book for you.  If you are a fan of Stephen King, then it is a no brainer that you will enjoy this book as it is classic King in everything but the scare you damn pants off of you. The only bad thing about this book is it is somewhat easy to guess the ending, it pretty much lays it out on the cover what eventually happens. It is kind of like the a story about the Titanic, you know it sinks at the end, it is the story between the beginning to the end that makes you like the book.  Overall I give this book a 9.5/10 when compared to your typical books out there, and a 8.0/10 when compared to other books within the King library or other authors who are as well written as king.  The book is still in hardcover, so it is $25.00, but I would say it is worth it for the money.  It would be a great book to curl up on the couch and read during the snowy days of winter.reading.<br /><br />I am primarily a sci-fi, fantasy, and mystery buff but this book easily appealed to me as a reader, I am not sure that King could write a bad book, maybe bad for him, but not in general compared to other authors.

If you are a fan of Stephen King, then it is a no brainer that you will enjoy this book as it is classic King in everything but the scare you damn pants off of you. The only bad thing about this book is it is somewhat easy to guess the ending, it pretty much lays it out on the cover what eventually happens. It is kind of like the a story about the Titanic, you know it sinks at the end, it is the story between the beginning to the end that makes you like the book.  Overall I give this book a 9.5/10 when compared to your typical books out there, and a 8.0/10 when compared to other books within the King library or other authors who are as well written as king.  The book is still in hardcover, so it is $25.00, but I would say it is worth it for the money.  It would be a great book to curl up on the couch and read during the snowy days of winter.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is a great book , simple language , frank feelings , attractive idea ,,the only objection is that it is so over rated and it contains a lot of description for the (in bed ) relation ,, repeated over and over ,,, yet i did not feel bored of it ,just the opposite was always looking forward to read more n more of it .. It is not a book that i would let a child see it but i recommend it HIGHLY to every one else..
B004SEUIWO|4.0|\\"Chicago\\" is a musical 'satire', but nonetheless a musical set in the roaring twenties when times were understandably wild. Renee Zellweger plays a wannabe chorus girl that dreams life around her in terms of theatrical sets. She would not hurt a worm, but in an instant of artistic indifference discovers that although 'he' thinks he is alive 'she' thinks him dead. The murder that follows sets the theme for this genre.<br /><br />In its broadest sense, the film is about American innocence seen through the actions of the not-so-innocent, about life in times of murder, greed, and bedlam.<br /><br />The flick won 'best picture' award and rightly so. The acting talents of Catherine Zeta-Jones are extended by her song and dance talents as well.<br /><br />Worth the money.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|this was a book i could not put down.  it has a rare beauty that touches on the ordinariness of life and yet how extradinary each life can be in its own way.  we do the best we can and sometimes our best is dreadful but sometimes it is amazing.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|While the middle tailed off for me a little in the extended chase sequence, this was a wonderful, suspensefilled read. The author himself mentions Twin Peaks as his inspiration and  I think the atmosphere in that series sums up the feel of Wayward Pines. The plot is original and thought provoking. The execution is well done and the suspense is well maintained throughout. The explanation was intriguing and unexpected. This is a great thriller, be it classed as sci fi or not, and well worth a read. I have come across Mr Crouch before in more conventional, if gory, settings. He writes well, so enjoy!

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I have always enjoyed Reacher books. But the formula is growing tired now. In this one, Reacher catches a lift in a car heading to Chicago with 2 men and a woman on board. At first he assumes they are returning from a corporate team building exercise as all are dressed similarly. However, it turns out they are running from a murder scene and the novel proceeds from there. As ever, we have Reacher operating just outside the law, drag in a few women and show our hero winning the day. Where this falls down is the lack of real substance behind the plot line. The plot is only filled in rather hastily at the end to explain all the action. I found the explanations poor and not very believable. Perhaps the real issue here is that this is a long series and the possibility of new plots for our action hero to shine in is growing thinner. I also agree with another reviewer here who suggested the only thing worth killing was Reacher's sense of humour. That too is true. There is a certain old fashioned chauvinism that shines through which is grating on me - for example the comment at one point that Reacher had female bosses if his luck was in. I am not suggesting these are sexist books, there are lots of strong female characters. There is just a tone in places which is a little condescending but probably unavoidable as these are military style novels although with Reacher long retired and now wandering the US as a sort of avenging angel.

B007PJFIU6|5.0|Dixit has been a favorite in our house for years and every expansion release breathes new life into our obsession. Each oversized card is a work of art in itself. Unlike many board/card games, Dixit is guaranteed to be different each time you play as every person has a role in what happens and the way each individual's perception changes over time will effect the stories the cards present to them.<br />Players take turns as \\"Storyteller\\" where they must present a short, imaginative offering cluing the other players in to what is on their chosen art card. However, care must be taken not to be too vague or too descriptive!<br /><br />If you're looking to spice up your game library or simply add to your Dixit card deck, Journey is a great buy.

B005LAIGSM|1.0|This movie is based on a facinating real life true story but something in it didn't jibe. The hole in it was not memory loss, but the non-appearance of God. This God did not need to be Catholic, and i can understand why, politically, it did not need to be a right-wing born-again Bible-thumping God....but no God, not even Hollywood's wishy-washy Higher Power (without those disconcerting issuesm of Sin, Suffering, Salvation)<br />Paige tells Leo she loves him after he has enthusiastically expounded his support of small businesses in a Greek Restaurant.  Couldn't they have touched on the Higher Power walking along Lake Michigan.  Did it have to be so....sanitized?<br />What held this couple together?<br />How could they morph from \\"He/She makes me laugh\\" to Leo standing by their relationship because there was more to their relationship.  The marriage vows are mainstream culture, aren't they?  Couldn't we have had them in some generic church with reference to Hollywood's own Higher Power God.  What kind of a vow was it if Paige was giggling and friends were taking a video that was Facebook level?  What kind of a vow was it if they were a group of naughty children in an art gallery the guards chased out?  Marriage then becomes something furtive, secretive, illlicit.  On what basis did Leo love Paige?<br />Paige was either a compliant rich Daddy's girl, following her father's wish to study law, or some giggly free spirit with a goofy grin on her face.  Where did she get the surprising moral fiber to be shocked by her father's affair, nay, even to make the startling decision to leave her family because of it?<br />Captivated by the premise[[ASIN:B005LAIGSM The Vow (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] I needed to know more about the real story and voila, there was God.  Well I did think we needed something more than the weird voiceover about \\"Moments of Impact\\"  leading to disorder and uncertainty and then fragments re-ordering themselves of their own volition.

Seems like it was written by several people that didn't have the same common interest.  Worst book ever written.

B005LAIHR2|2.0|I really wanted to love this movie since I grew up listening to the music in it.  However, the acting was horrible and there wasn't really a strong storyline.  I'm no prude but this movie had a couple of very unnecessary parts in it that were just thrown in without any reason.  I would not recommend this movie.  Buy the songs by the original artists and skip this waste of time.  The music was the only reason I gave the movie 2 stars.  Otherwise, it truly doesn't even deserve one star.

B0031SCV46|3.0|This seems like a great keyboard.  Unfortunately, it requires expensive software to make it work.  So far, it has sat on a shelf and I have been unable to buy the software that costs many times as much as the keyboard in order to make it functional.  It would have been nice if the keyboard came with some basic piano software for the computer.  If you plan on mixing music and doing fancy stuff than this keyboard may fit your needs.  If you only want to learn to play piano, then a simple Casio keyboard may be more practical and affordable.
B0088WK27S|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie when I rented it.  In fact, I was a little taken back by the title, expecting a \\"B\\" movie.  As soon as I turned it on I was hooked.  Being based upon a real person, this story demonstrates that anyone, no matter who or what they are can make a major difference in the world.  I highly recommend this movie.  It is truly a great movie.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|when i got these i was afraid the high frequencies would be too much for me. i know my audio setup in my vehicles i HATE when its ear piercing or high pitch at all. these dont have that problem<br /><br />ive read open headphones sound the best, but i got these for work and i thought it would be enough but i can sometimes still hear the loud people talking at work while listening to these.<br /><br />i cant say how much they leak or how loud, but i havent gotten any complaints and thats sitting next to people.<br /><br />i gave it 4 stars because it is great for its price, and no one may be able to top it at this price range, but if i had to do it over again i would spend a little more and get a bit better sound. they sound really good, bass is solid, i just know there is better out there(i would say these are best for the price). these are prefect for what i bought them for(i needed cheap but sound good for work in case they got stolen)

1607105551|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

160710556X|5.0|Everybody knows him -- the pipe-smoking detective on Baker Street (with or without the movie-added deerstalker), who is able to deduce all sorts of things just by glancing at a person. \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" shows off Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first collection of short stories involving Holmes, mingling human psychology with sometimes bizarre mysteries.<br /><br />Holmes is visited by the masked King of Bohemia, who has a slight problem: he's engaged to a princess, but his former lover Irene Adler has a compromising letter that could jeopardize his future marriage. But Adler has a formidable brain of her own. Then Holmes is hired by a man who was hired by the mysterious Red-Headed League, and given a strange job... which is somehow connected to a criminal undertaking.<br /><br />Among the other strange cases that Holmes and Watson undertake -- a missing fiance, a strange murder in Boscombe Valley, a dead man who was sent five orange seeds, a woman whose husband has utterly vanished, a blue jewel hidden in a Christmas turkey, a dead woman whose last words were \\"it was the band, the speckled band!\\", a young engineer given a dream job, an American heiress who vanishes directly after her wedding, a broken beryl coronet, and a young woman given a surreally weird job.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes mysteries come in two types:<br />1. The case is completely baffling, and Holmes is needed to unravel the knot of obscure clues.<br />2. The case seems straightforward, but Holmes is needed to connect seemingly unrelated clues to the crime in order to find the REAL perpetrator.<br /><br />There are plenty of both kinds in \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" with a dozen cases that require Holmes' unique detecting skills -- it can be something as simple as locating a letter, or something as complex as foiling a robbery or counterfeiting ring. Doyle's stately, dignified prose is heightened by moments of excitement or horror (\\" It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek\\"), and he wove in a lot of human psychology into Holmes' cases.<br /><br />Holmes himself... is Holmes. Doyle didn't like his detective much, but Sherlock's knife-edged intellect and fascination with puzzles are strangely hypnotic -- even if you wouldn't like to be roomies with the guy, it would be amazing just to sit and watch him work. Watson is the perfect counterpoint for Holmes: he's not a genius but is definitely intelligent, warm-hearted and capable.<br /><br />\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" is a magnificent collection of Holmes' first twelve short cases, filled with murder, intrigue and all sorts of weird crimes.

1582406723|4.0|This is going to be one of my shorter posts since this wasn't terribly long. I really really love the show but I was curious about how the book was next to the show. There's a lot more in the series obviously, but Season one ends shortly after the first volume ends. I didn't want to  read the second one yet, at least not until the second season ends.<br /><br />I think one of the reasons I really liked this book was because I cannot STAND Shane. He pisses me off beyond belief and when Carl shot him in the neck, I was so happy. But thats the end, so let me go back to the beginning. We are introduced to Rick who has just come out of a coma and has no idea what is happening. He encounters a few zombies when he is saved by a stranger living in his neighbors house, they help each other out Rick by giving this stranger guns and this stranger by taking Rick in. They part ways with Rick heading to Atlanta hoping to find his wife and son.<br /><br />He is found in Atlanta by a young man named Glenn who helps to get him out of the city without being eaten. Glenn brings Rick back to his base camp in the mountains outside of Atlanta where he finds his family. It isn't outright said that his wife, Lori slept with Shane, his best friend, but it is played up in the show.<br /><br />It is wonderfully drawn and a lot of fun to see the aftermath of what the world would be like and how people survive in the aftermath. I'm hoping that in future volumes they get into how this all started and what is happening in the rest of the world.

0439023513|4.0|There were a handful of things that bothered me about this book. There was the transformation of Katniss from this fearless girl who took the places of her sister into this girl who spend two thirds of the book in the hospital. I understand that she was only 17 as the events of the last two took took place, but honestly, the fact that they made her such a victim was irritating.<br /><br />In this book there is a full out war between the Capital and District 13 that is spreading to the other districts. Katnisses district has been bombed and is gone and the other districts aren't in better shape. At first there are a lot of problems such as Katniss' unwillingness to help out the cause, but once they do get her on board the action picks up. It goes from mostly being a mental battle in her head to action, back to the inner battle, to action, and then again this mental battle.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most upsetting events in this book is what happens with Peeta and what the Capital does to him when they have him in their power. It's actually heartbreaking since I've always been a big supporter of Katniss and Peeta as a real couple. This particular book had more of a Gale/Katniss vibe to it as it progressed even as Peeta and Katniss were reunited.<br /><br />One of the hardest things in this book was following the different characters and names. There were just so many of them and they were all so weird. One of the best things about reading with my Nook was that in the event I forgot who someone was, I could go to the \\"Find\\" feature by tapping the bottom of the touch screen and typing in the name that I was unsure about. I had to do that in Catching Fire with Seneca Crane because for the life of me, I couldn't remember who he was.<br /><br />If you thought that the first two books were bloody, you haven't seen anything until you see the body count in this one. It was like the hits never stopped coming. I'm not sure if I didn't give myself enough time to fall in love with these characters, but I didn't cry reading this book as one might think. (Given I keep crying when I read.) There was one death that almost brought me to tears but since it was hardly mentioned, I hardly grieved.<br /><br />Apparently there were plot holes that people had problems with, but I personally didn't see any, but I do think that this is a book that I will have to re-read because reading it in one night was just way too much. My same recommendation stands, everyone should read this series, thought I think 14 and older is more ideal.with these characters, but I didn't cry reading this book as one might think.

0446547654|5.0|enjoyed this book very much!  I enjoy all of N. Sparks books.  They are written in and around places I am familiar with as I live in NC.  Just ordered four more of his books and can';t wait to get them.
0545128285|4.0|So this is going to be another short post because this book was super short and they were a collection of stories rather than a story with a plot. This book consisted of five fables and then commentary by Albus Dumbledore. The first story was of a magic pot with a slipper, the next had to do with a magical fountain, another had a hairy heart, and then there was Babbity Rabbity and the most famous story was that of the Deathly Hallows.<br /><br />It was hit or miss with the stories. I didn't really like the story about the magic pot that wants to do good. It was cute, but I wasn't my favorite story. The moral of this story was about doing good deeds and helping muggles. My least favorite of all was the story of the hairy heart- a man who was afraid of love so he turned to dark magic and removed his heart.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the clever story of Babbity Rabbity-the gullible king and the con artist who try to pull a fast one on a clever witch. It made you laugh which was good and like the other stories it was nice and easy to read. My other favorite story was about the Fair Fountain that provides good fortune to one person a day so long as the person reaches it, but its a sneaky fountain and the four people that make it toward the fountain have to decide who gets to reap the benefits.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows story doesn't even need explaining. Dumbledores commentary on all of the stories was a little dull at some points as it explained how the wizarding world took each of the stories. Perhaps the best explanation was of the Deathly Hallows and how he keeps trying to deny their existence. It was also funny when he talked about the Malfoy's and how their detested each of the stories and their morals.<br /><br />Its a fun story for fans of any age, and great for people who want to learn even the teensiest about the wizarding world that Rowling created. This along with Fantastic Beasts and Quidditch through the Ages, you get to learn so much more about that world which is great.world which is great.

0439023491|5.0|I cannot rave more about this book. The story picks up months after the Games ended and now Peeta and Katniss are about to go on their victory tour. It is clear from the start that life for Katniss hasn't been what she hoped since she returned to District 12. After she receives a visit from President Snow that threatens everyone she knows, she has to try to make sure everyone knows that she and Peeta are truly in love when their relationship has been frosty at best.<br /><br />The tour starts off in the District where Rue was from and what does Katniss do but incite agitation by declaring Rue's death nothing but a tragedy. She started to go against everything that Snow asked her to do. Because of this she has to try even harder even going as far as asking Peeta to propose for the benefit of The Capitol. It's easy for me, a college educated 20 year old to judge the actions of an uneducated 17 year old. She got frustrating as she did things without thinking it through and sometimes she over-thought situations.<br /><br />I don't mean to say that she wasn't smart but that she just got on my nerves, but like I said I knew a lot of what was going on so its easy to judge. If I had ever been put in Katniss' position, I don't think I would have been able to survive and do what she did. She maintains her strength as she works through having to play in the Games...Again.<br /><br />She and Peeta both go back into the ring and as they prepare for it, they find out that there are a series of rebellions in the different districts. Since they live in a world of propaganda, no one really knows what is happening in the different districts until the very end of the book.<br /><br />Who would I recommend this to? The same people who I recommended the first book to. Everyone should read this series. It wasn't until I was talking to my cousin, who is a teacher that I was able to see how close we are to this world they have.

0307949486|4.0|I wasn't blown away by this book, but I did really like it. I'm starting to think that when I listen to a book I love it less. Then again, in the case of this book, I'm not sure I would have even finished this book. Just listening to it I could hear how well it was written, no joke. The descriptions were so vivid and perfect. I remember at one point stoping and thinking about how descriptive it was.<br /><br />I didn't think that the sex scenes and rape scenes were as graphic as everyone made them sound, but then again I was expecting something much much worse, not to say that they weren't awful to listen to. Maybe because I was only listening, which meant I could do other things, it didn't hit me as hard as if I were reading it. To be honest, I can't really recall the rape scene with Lisbeth, but I think that might be because I wasn't paying enough attention.<br /><br />I'm glad Lisbeth did what she did to her guardian. I thought the whole concept of the guardianship to be so wrong and it was too open to the abuses like the one that Lisbeth had to go through. Although, tattooing his chest was just desserts, as well as raping him in her own way. Of course, this kind of screwed up was just a taste for the incest, rape and murder that was to come.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I liked Blomkvist, sure he was really awesome and whatnot, but he seemed liked too much. I'm not sure how to describe it really except that it irritated me that he went to bed with nearly all the main females in the book; Berger- his co-owner of Millennium, Cecilia Vangar- his neighbor while investigating the Vangar family, and finally Lisbeth Salander. I don't know, it just really bothered me. I didn't care much that he was disgraced for libel and the background story.<br /><br />I did appreciate the ending because it could have been left as just one book, but there are two more out there. With so much controversy surrounding this book and the rest of the series, it's all very exciting. I just read that there is a majority of the fourth book, but Larsson's family won't allow his girlfriend to finish it, which, as a fan is disappointing. Although since I don't know how the last book ends, it might actually be an okay thing.ead that there is a majority of the fourth book, but Larsson's family won't allow his girlfriend to finish it, which, as a fan is disappointing.

1451627297|4.0|I am so on the fence about this book its redonkulous. This book was a lot to digest, I mean a lot. Not just because of its length, because that wasn't the problem, and the method of time travel wasn't that bad either, but when you examined how every decision he made impacted those around him and its impact on history-it was a doozie. For being such a long book, it was a pretty quick read, if i had had one day to just devote to reading it, I like to think I would have been able to put it away easy.<br /><br />I understand now what people mean about him being one of the best storytellers of our time. While the story of time travel can seem somewhat overdone, King adds, a new twist to it. Every time you go back into the past, its a do over, so say you go back to 1958 kill a man then come back to our time, but go back again, the man will be alive again when you return a second time. It's a paradox in a paradox.<br /><br />Its hard not to explain this book and what I didn't like about it without a little summary but I'll be brief. Jake Epping, our dear hero and English teacher gets dragged into trying to save Kennedy. He goes into the past only a few times, but each time he gives a pretty detailed account of what happens. That was perhaps my biggest problem; the amount of information that he gave you. I suppose it was somewhat important that before going to Texas he lived in Florida for a few months, but then again, it wasn't. Nothing of that had to do with killing Oswald, and in my eyes was just extra.<br /><br />I liked how King added what Epping did while in Texas, it would be hard to explain away nearly five years with just a paragraph, so I thought that the pages about his life in Jodie, Texas were worthwhile. I also felt that the addition of Sadie as his love interest was a great move because there were only so many pages that could discuss Oswald beating his wife.<br /><br />After letting this book sink in, I've decided not to throw all the spoilers at you, instead I want you to go out and read this book, even if its the only book you read all year. Considering my only complaint is the length (and it wasn't that bad) and the 1950's language, then I would say you have a pretty stellar book on your hands.d I want you to go out and read this book, even if its the only book you read all year.

B008MJC6ZS|5.0|I've been listening to Testament since about 87, although I had put them away for a few years up until now.  Every great older thrash band deserves a second chance to shine. Exodus is doing really well lately as well. So I picked up Dark Roots and am very pleased with it.  Very catchy, thrashy and memorable. I recommend it!
0553584537|3.0|So for a detective novel, this has everything you could want; a good cop in a bad place, a blood thirsty killer, and a situation where everything isn't quite what it seems. I liked how this story also highlighted the abuses of the system; powerful people using their position to hide their problems. I wasn't totally in love with this book especially since it is supposed to be a detective DD Warren book, and yet she's not in it till the middle.<br /><br />I guess since I was able to have feelings for characters, thats the important part. I had my moments where all I did was yell \\"No! Why would you do that!? Its a trap! You deserve whatever they do to you!\\" I think to feel for the characters is something that every writer wants their reader to do. Was I crazy about the decisions made in this book? No. But alas, I am only the reader, and if the characters could respond to my warnings, well, that would be really awesome, but also not this book.<br /><br />Something I also liked about this book was that Gardner kept you confused. You didn't know if so and so was a good guy or a bad guy (I've decided not to give anything away for this book). Alone was able to weave together a really skillful story that just seemed insane, but it was a great plot nevertheless. Sadly a plot does not make a story and there are a lot more crime books that I would recommend before this one. (I guess thats why this review is just a poor one)

0062197258|4.0|I expected a lot of things from this book, but that was only because I was holding it to previous thriller expectations. While this book does create a sense of physical suspense of who is hiding in the shadows, most of the time it is an emotional thrill. Haynes seems to have created her own type of thriller in this book which was great.<br /><br />I loved that we flipped through the days almost like a diary but not written like one. We would star with one day in 2003 and the next day we would talk about would be in 2007, and I loved that because while it could be confusing you were able to see who she became because of what happened and it raised questions like \\"Well, we've met all of her friends, but four years later why does she say that she has no friends?\\" I felt that this was a whole new element of suspense.<br /><br />I really really didn't like her friends for a few reasons. Unfortunately for you, those reasons will remain in the pages of my journal because it is a huge spoiler alert. I did feel that the most important moment was when Cathy realizes that getting out of an abusive relationship isn't as easy as everyone seems to think that it is. It is so easy to look from the outside and say \\"Well, just leave\\" but when you're in it, clearly it is a lot more complex. I loved Stu and how he tried to help her get through this whole thing. I could only imagine how hard it could be trying to help someone wrestle their very alive demons.<br /><br />What kept this book from being a four was that it did lack the suspense for me. It was cool how it fipped back and forth, and that really did keep me reading, however, because you already have a big sense of what was going to happen, I felt that it was harder for me to be on edge.<br /><br />I really loved reading this book once I had the chance to sit down and read it (sadly I got sick right after starting it and so I had a listless day where I whined about wanting to read but feeling to sick to). In the end it wound up being a great book that I know I'm going to recommend.<br /><br />Afterthought: I noticed on my ARC that it said that the film rights have been optioned and I actually have an opinion on that. Generally I hohum about my books being made to movies, but in the end, I still like to see them. I don't think I would want to see this movie for a few reasons. One, it would eliminate the uniqueness of jumping between before and after because that would make for a horrible movie. Two, there would be no way to properly capture the fear and anxiety that Cathy feels through the whole book. There is only so far that music and good acting can take you.being a great book that I know I'm going to recommend.<br /><br />Afterthought: I noticed on my ARC that it said that the film rights have been optioned and I actually have an opinion on that.

0307716546|4.0|The end of this book left me feeling at peace if you can believe it. The entire time that I read this book, there was always a chance that things would work out with a happy ending or that there would be a happy ending. Maybe I'm just an optimist, but I always hold onto the hope that there will be a happy ending.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting the book to go the way that it did, but then again, after I started it and I had that thought, I wondered what I was expecting, and then I realized that I had no idea what I was expecting but what the book was, I didn't expect. I still really enjoyed this book. What I didn't realize was that the book was about Grace and her daughter Jenny stuck in the in-between.<br /><br />After being badly injured the in fire, Grace and Jenny try to come to peace with what happened while also trying to figure out how this happened. I loved that Grace's sister in law, a police detective, tried her hardest to solve the mystery of who set this fire. I loved that even though they didn't see eye to eye, she still fought her hardest to protect Grace and her family when she couldn't.<br /><br />This book lead you down so many different paths of who did it and why that you don't even know until the very end why it happened which I thought was so messed up but at the same time I thought it was brilliant. A lot of people seemed disappointed in this book (at least the top reviewed on goodreads). I felt very at peace with the ending of the book which was surprising to me. I totally loved it and how it discussed the mother/daughter relationship.
B006YZOXHQ|4.0|I was never a big fan of this movie but my wife and several other of my friends are, so I bought this as a gift for her. We watched it and I was amazed at how much better this film had gotten over the years, or perhaps it was just that I had learned to appreciate it. Either way we had a blast watching it again and the blue-ray really makes those wild, vivid colors pop not to mention that Jane was a real hottie back then (I mean, after all, she did follow Bridgette Bardot into Roger Vadim's (the director of Barbarella) bed.
0061726834|3.0|I keep asking myself why I gave this book three stars when this book was almost completely a set up book. By that I mean that the book set the stage for the rest of the trilogy, and there is nothing wrong with that. It was a very quick read, very easy to get through, and the concept was a very interesting one. The idea that Love is a disease and that we need a cure for it, I really liked that.<br /><br />This new dystopian genre, inspired by The Hunger Games and Uglies, and other books, seem to be here to stay. With so many of these books popping up its hard not to see similarities or even come up with a totally new idea, which I think Oliver was able to do. One thing all of these books have in common is a government that has over stepped their bounds and lies to their people and those people accept that lie. In this case it's that Love will kill you and that its a bad thing and instead they offer a cure, they don't explain exactly how they do it, but it seems like a good old fashion Lobotomy for those aged 18 and up.<br /><br />I remember getting to page 200 and thinking \\"Well, I'm halfway through and nothing has happened\\"And in most books that would have bothered me but I understand that there is the need to set the stage. At the start of each chapter, we were given a glimpse into the beliefs of this society. The \\"Elemental Prayers\\" and children's rhymes, which really had nothing to do with what was going on but were fun to hear about all the same.<br /><br />I went from 4 down to 3 stars because I couldn't really come up with a good reason for why I should give it more stars. I guess because I liked the idea or someone fighting everything they ever knew for love, and not just a relationship but for the right to love. It was also easy to see how they twisted love into a disease- one that cause all types of infections and reactions.<br /><br />I really liked Alex, the Invalid boy from the Wilds who opens up to Lena. I don't know how I felt about Lena- I can understand her transformation from a girl who was excited to be cured to realizing that the cure was almost like a jail sentence. And then there was Hana who was completely uncommitted to the cause (who also has a novella coming out on February 14 -maybe Free- on MTV.com).<br /><br />Overall this book didn't get my heart racing, but I did like the book in the end even if it feels like it went nowhere. Since I've read this first book, I'm now invested in the series and I plan on reading the second book, Pandemonium, but I'm not sure when that will be.and her transformation from a girl who was excited to be cured to realizing that the cure was almost like a jail sentence.

B004I4H8QS|5.0|Quite simply, this is one of the best Rock'n'Roll Blues albums ever recorded, right up there with Sgt. Pepper.<br /><br />This album was being recorded in Florida and Eric Clapton was not having a good time. Duane Allman, guitarist for the Allman Brothers Band, heard from friends that Eric (Duane's idol) was in the area and returned from the west coast to try to look him up and see if they might have a chance to jam or whatever. Eric took Duane up on his offer just so he could get away from the recoding sessions and liked how well they played together so much that he scrapped the tracks he already had and started over with Duane. This is, of course, after his having to deal with his unrequited love for his best friend's (Beatle George Harrison's) wife (the beautiful Patty Boyd).<br /><br />There are simply no throwaway songs on this record and each one is a perfectly constructed little gem arranged with great care and placed on the album in a way that the whole becomes much larger than its parts.<br /><br />This is a MUST-HAVE recording for any serious collector of Rock'n'Roll and/or blues.

B0079XNWQA|3.0|I'm a massive Mraz fan.  His voice is magic and there's no denying that, but this new CD is just too mellow and midtempo.  Where's the funky Jason Mraz who sings of a woman's \\"Butterfly\\" or boasts about his own lyrical skills on \\"Wordplay?\\"  The CD is not bad (\\"93 Million Miles\\" and \\"Hidden Track\\" are my favorites), but it all kind of melds together and the songs sound pretty similar.  I hope, on his next CD, he realizes that we need some more upbeat tunes.

0062183591|5.0|I was looking for something fun and interesting to read on a flight back from India to the USA. I picked up this book in the airport for about 7 or 8 bucks as it was rated #2 in sales and looked like an easy read. My thoughts:<br />-It reminded me a lot of the Freakenomics and Super Freakenomics books, full of interesting little tid bits and written in a very easy to read style. I finished it in about 8 hours or so.<br />-I didn't find a lot of useless filler like I feel I have in books written by Malcolm Gladwell. What I mean by this is I feel like Gladwell wastes a lot of time and pages describing the people he interviewed or talked to. Ariely mentions the people he worked with as they deserve credit, but he doesn't spend time telling me what his assistants looked like unless it pertains to the central messaging of the book or the chapter.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend it to other folks looking for something entertaining but at the same time educational. I'll very likely pick up one of Ariely's other books based on reading this.

B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|The demo game, Missile Command, handles like a dream. I quickly bought all the games for 9.99 based on the track ball. I found the other control types bad. In 2600 mode, the numeric keypad is unnecessarily small. The directional controls require you to find the proper triangle for the direction you want to move. This is near impossible. The game should know where your finger moves relative to its last position and change course. You have to cover two triangles to move diagonally in the 2600 games. Games like Asteroid that require you to rotate and thrust offer both on the same button. A player will easily thrust accidentally while rotating. There's an option to put the thrust on the opposite side of the screen, but the rotational control then becomes a slider that requires extreme movement to turn the spaceship around. The sliders should move the playing piece more than the finger moves. It should be accelerated like a computer mouse. Games like Circus Atari require you to put your finger over the sprite you control, if you want full screen. I'm playing on a tiny seven inch Kindle Fire. I want full screen on all the games. The slider should be perpendicular to the action. This is similar to the feel of an actual paddle. To adjust the control settings, you have to exit the game and go back to the game selection menu. There are several control layouts available for each game, but they often do not include the most ergonomic design. I wonder if the designers were actually using a tablet to playtest. I will compile a list of games and the proper control layout for each. I will send this list to Atari. Two player games like Combat have no AI. The opponent just mirrors your moves. I think Atari gave away the best, by far, game to trick us into buying the rest. I suggest we all send our complaints to Atari. Atari has been there for me throughout my life. I hope they don't let me down at this point.<br /><br />EDIT: I sent my complaints to Atari support. They told me to post my complaints in their official forum. After finding the active official forum, I signed up. I was then logged in and taken to the main site. I went back to the forum through the main site. I wasn't automatically logged in to the forum. I entered my user name and pass and was repeatedly told it was incorrect. I cannot log into the forum.<br /><br />EDIT: Atari says I can get a refund if the app is on an Apple product. I already told them I have a Fire. Atari told me to register for the forum at a different page. There is only one registration link. I'm finding out that the Atari site is often down and filled with errors. Never again will I buy Atari. It's not the company I grew up with.<br /><br />EDIT: I contacted the programmers. I was told that these are the controls that were most favored by the testers. I was also told that not everyone likes Missile Command, and there was no rhyme or reason for featuring it. I'm off to play games I can control like 3D Tic Tac Toe and Stellar Track. I'm tired of fighting, and those are my favorite games anyway.
0099579936|1.0|I am not finished with this book yet, and I am having a hard time getting through it.  I cannot believe how poorly written it is!  There has to be at least 2 \\"holy crap\\" exclamations on each page, and there is an awful lot of blushing and intense stares. I cannot find anything to like about the main characters and there is very little detail as to why they are the way they are.  In addition, the author is English and fails miserably at writing American dialogue, using English words and expressions, such as \\"let's have a go\\" and \\"I'm not keen on coffee\\".  A little research into the vernacular would have helped. This book just goes to show that sex sells, because I can't think of any other reason that this trilogy is a best seller.  I gave it one star because there was no other choice, but really, it doesn't deserve any stars at all!

I'd have to agree with several other reviewers on the lighting and make up . . . sub par may be an understatement. You've all seen Back to the Future II, correct? Remember when they aged George McFly (Crispin Glover) for the 2015 time period? Yeah, the movie make up here is just as bad . . . you'd think Hollywood could improve this in 23 years. I didn't hate the movie by any means, but I really felt that all it truly highlighted was J Edgar continually fighting his inner demons. J Edgar Hoover seemed like a real ass, with an ego the size of Texas.

For the most part I was pleasantly suprised.<br />The music sounds better than I expected and I've never once had a problem getting clean, clear reception through my radio.<br />The reasons I gave it 3 stars instead of 5:<br /><br />The remote. It worked the first day, then it kinda worked again a week later. Has not worked at all since.<br /><br />The unit buttons.  Since the remote does not work I have to use the buttons on the unit. They also only work intermittently.<br />Alot of times the back button doesn't work at all. Some days, I can scroll back through albums, most days I<br />have to scroll forward. Some days I can clear and set bookmarks, most days it just pauses the song. This is very<br />frustrating considering the remote is useless.<br /><br />Aside from that I would still recommend this product. The sound and reception are great. But be warned, some days you may have to just settle for whatever music is on, or spend 10 minutes trying to go to a different album (as long as you're not driving!).<br /><br />ALWAYS pay attention to the road!

I liked that the pictures had no order and seemed to be thrown together, as chaos is the essence of GaGa.  My favorite pictures are of GaGa eating pasta, working out, and taking a bath.  It's always great to see celebrities doing everyday things, normal things.  I give this book only 4 stars because there were several pages left blank.  I'm not sure if this was intentional or a printing error, but it was very disappointing.

I seriously cannot believe these guys have this much left in them. I easily can say it's my second favorite album and threatening to tie for first with SFAM. There is nothing weak on this record. A must have!

1573228737|5.0|The narrator of this novel is a troubled young woman in Victorian London. Living in a well to do household under her mother's thumb, bereft after her beloved father's death and lonely after the female she loved decided to marry...she is encouraged to become a Lady Visitor at Millbank Prison.<br />Waters' descriptions of prison life alone are fascinating:<br />'The towers seem to have grown higher and broader, and the windows to have shrunk...since I last went there- the grounds smelling of fog and of chimney smoke as well as of sedge, and the wards reeking of nuisance-buckets still, of cramped and unwashed hair and flesh and mouths, but also of gas and rust and sickness. There are great black, blistering radiators...the cells however remain so chill that the walls are wet with condensation, the lime upon them turned to a kind of bubbling curd...the women in them hunched, like goblins, over their sewing or their coir'.<br />As Margaret meets some of the inmates, she is drawn to one Selina Dawes, a beautiful spirit-medium, parts of whose own narrative are interspersed with the main one. Is she real or a fraud? As the cover blurb states: 'you'll find yourself desperately wanting to believe in magic'.<br />I couldn't put it down!
B001XUPF2O|1.0|I am a huge fan of Amazon, outside of this comment I have nothing but great things to say about them and their exceptional customer service. Also, my star rating was not because this was a bad movie. I give this a one star because I could not rent it in HD on my computer. I ended up renting it through the itunes store, for $1 cheaper and able to watch it on my computer. Amazon says that HD is only available for amazon instant video devices such as roku, xbox, PS3, etc. I know they are trying to drive sales of those devices, but I think this is a huge mistake. I buy everything on amazon for the convenience and great customer service, but this huge disadvantage drove me to rent the movie from Apple. (Until this I hadn't paid for something from apple since I started buying my music and movies from Amazon 2 years ago). Please fix the problem Amazon, or I will continue enjoying HD movies on my computer courtesy of Apple.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Troubled guy at remote Alaskan outpost backs off on suicide attempt to catch a plane out with other workers. The plane crashes, leaving a handful of survivors who conveniently represent and contrast unique personality types (see Seven Dwarfs) to play off the protagonist. Logic would seem to dictate that they fashion the wreckage into some kind of shelter and await a search team tracing the plane's route. But, logic missed the casting call for this flick.<br /><br />They work on the premise that there's little interest or resources lined up to locate them. Really? I'm guessing a couple hundred stakeholders and their rabid attorneys might provide some motivation for a rescue attempt.<br /><br />Enter the threat, in the form of a wolf pack. Try to overlook that wolves do not reside in this region and that the breed avoids man (global wolf attack fatalities annually can be counted on one hand, or less). And, get used to overlooking, because you'll need to do a lot of this before this derelict finally slides beneath the waves. And spare me the pseudo-intellectual allegorical dodge. Moby Dick was symbolization, but at least he acted like a whale. And he looked a heck of a lot more like a whale in the 1956 movie than these cartoon wolves resemble canines with 21st century technology.<br /><br />The first attack is repelled by clubbing the beasts. Why use sharp pieces of metal or the protagonist's rifle when you can flail? By the way, the rifle is discarded because of a broken stock. Apparently, in the wilderness, no weapon is deemed better than one that's superficially damaged in this reality. Theorizing that the wolves are bent upon destroying them (attributing human thought processes to the beasts), the survivors nonetheless set off without fashioning weapons from the wreckage.<br /><br />Predictably, the wolves commence picking off the cast, one by one. When there are two left, one falls into a frigid stream and is swept downstream by the current. The protagonist does the only thing the cognitive standard of this movie will permit. He leaps into the frigid waters, too.<br /><br />Miraculously, neither suffers cold shock. But, the first man gets his foot entrapped, holding his head underwater upstream. Come again? That's the equivalent of holding the string of a balloon and it strains upwind. With this contradiction to the laws of physics in effect, it comes as no surprise that the rescuer cannot elevate the victim's head above water. Failing to do so, he remains in the freezing water to contemplate this and allow hypothermia to get a better death grip on him.<br /><br />But, of course it doesn't. Fifteen minutes of being immersed in this freezing water and/or subsequently exposed to the cold wind would render you incapable of doing anything to fend off your impending doom. But, you're not in this movie.<br /><br />Having shrugged off the mere discomfort of hypothermia, the protagonist trudges on to the obvious next scene, a confrontation with the wolf pack. Who didn't see this one marching down Main Street? In a tableau reminiscent of \\"West Side Story,\\" the lesser players back off to set the stage for a mano a Fido throwdown between the respective alpha role players. Cue the dancers. \\"When you're a wolf you're a wolf all the way...\\"<br /><br />In an attempt at drama, the film ends with the outcome unknown. Root for the wolf.
0312323867|5.0|It's rare for a sequel to be better than it's predecessor, but that's exactly what happens with Something Blue, the follow up to Something Borrowed. I was honestly a little hesitant to read this one because I really hated Darcy in Something Borrowed, and I knew this was her story of the aftermath. After finishing it, though, I could not recommend it highly enough to anyone who read the first book.<br />Things I didn't like: Darcy's character is still really annoying and childish for a large part of the book. This was pretty realistic, though, for someone who is used to everything being easy. She has to figure out her life and that's a hard thing to do without melting down. It was also fairly predictable. This wasn't such a bad thing, though; the ending I had planned was the one I wanted, and I was happy to see it play out that way.<br />Things I liked: I love who Darcy becomes. This was an empowering novel for women getting their act together. I love Ethan. (The first movie did not do this man justice!) He was a great supporting character and a great friend.<br />While this isn't an instant classic or anything that should make the literary canon, it is a great story of friendship, love, and finding what matters. This is what \\"chick lit\\" should be.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|Worst film adaptation of a brilliant book I have seen in years. They are adaptations because wriitten story form does not perfectly translate to visual, things must be condensed, altered in order to tell the story in a decent amount of time, but it must be done carefully, with respect to the original work, the message, the characters, the fans, and the artist behind them. Honestly, I loved the book, usually I'm defending film adaptations of wonderful books; this time I can't. It was terrible, I haven't seen an adaptation this awful since Eragon. The acting was fine, the costuming was okay, the fault lies with director and screenwriter as far as I can tell. If you haven't seen it spare yourself.
B000YPWDSS|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic album. I can't speak highly enough of it.  I didn't realise until the other day that it has a bonus CD. Fabulous Amy Winehouse at her very best.
0307744434|4.0|This was a very magical book, full of wonderful imagination and great writing. Where it fell short for me was in the characters. The premise of romance was overblown and rather a subplot. I would have liked a lot more focus on Marco and Celia and their perspective of the circus. Nevertheless, they were good characters that were unique in their own sense. It was definitely an enjoyable read, although I found myself not understanding a lot of what was going on due to lack of explanation. Things seemed to be happening that were supposed to be hints or clues and they just did not piece the story together for me. Still, the magic was worth it, and it certainly did feel like a trip to a marvelous circus.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Needed to replace the original cord which disintegrated!! This one seems much more flexible and is exactly what I needed. Able to wind it up for portability which I was not able to do with the original one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it no problems really. few times it said pinterest was having some problems but overall no problems love it!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|dragon story is awesome.you can breed your own dragon, discover new dragons, and feed your dragon so it can grow big and strong.
0670022411|5.0|I needed a good story, an escape piece, to take the edge off a crazy week!  I got a wonderful mix of fable and history, romance and wonder.  I couldn't put it down, and nearly cried when this portion of the tale ended, and hung.  Just downloaded the next book and can't wait to get started!
B008220CHO|5.0|Yeah ok it was really really good ,go see it absolutely .now lets adress the elephant in the room(who you callin an elephant ?) ,you talk about an exorcism movie you can't help but compare it to the exorcist ,and i guess it holds it's own (better than someone else's ) i wasn't dissapointed ,i can't wait till it comes out on dvd and blu ray to own this fantastic movie .it comes at you at a perfect pace ,it's directed very well ,a very well made movie ,it does have those special moments in a movie where you are deeply impressed .the grand finale is pretty good too ,especially the very end .the child actress who plays the part of em is unbelievable and i guess as she gets older can only get better .don't miss this one in the theater .just go enjoy it whatever you do .
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I agree with the other reviews, this new version is a lot easier than before but in all honesty there are a few things that changed for example :<br /><br />1. freeze the spider , available in early levels<br />2. evade two spiders available in early levels .<br />3. graphics are much better<br />so overall this is a must have if you don't have greedy spider 1 , if you already do have it then you may find this new game repetitive but it will still be fun .
B004BLJQOK|5.0|This movie was one that let me get more popcorn on the floor than in my mouth. Crazy scary, and always seems to be worse when the creepy one ends up being a kid for some reason. Will make you think twice about any new neighbors moving in with a blonde haired little girl.Don't let her in.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its okay but I like it because it has all these little mini games and then you kinds get addicted to it if you beat a few levels but each mini game is way to similar those are the only two things that hurt the game
B004IM92HI|5.0|Josh groban album Awake is a great album.  Is great to see a new recording in vinyl and enjoy it on a turntable.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|recently saw this flick for the first time and oh my god, IT'S SO AWESOME! this is the type of movie my father would watch since he was a huge clint eastwood fan and this flick is his best movie since dirty harry. what more can i say about this movie and eastwood? he's such an awesome actor. the casting for this flick was spot on and i think this flick should've won either an oscar or a golden globe. of course, i will say my least favorite scene in the flick is when mcdermott's character gets killed.
0061743526|5.0|I get asked all the time which book is my favorite of all.  When you've read as many books as I have, that should be a hard question to answer.  But, it isn't.  Because no book even comes close to this one.  This one is my favorite, each and every time I read it.  And, every time I read it I see some new gem that sparkles like a literary diamond.<br /><br />The story is set in 1930's Alabama and the setting and characters are portrayed with razor-sharp clarity.  It doesn't depict the South; it is Southernness.  The story centers around a young girl named Scout, her brother Jem and their father Atticus (whom I am madly in love with).  Atticus is the town's defense attorney and has been tasked with defending a black man accused of raping a local white girl.  Atticus is bound to do his duty he does it the best he can, certain the young black father is innocent.<br /><br />This book shows the very worst and best of every human emotion-love, hate, ignorance, oppression, bigotry, hope, despair-all without apology.  After the roller coaster emotional ride, it finally leaves the reader feeling like a bandage was just ripped from the heart.<br /><br />Read it again and again.  And, just when you think it has no more lessons to teach you; read it one more time.
0345803485|5.0|I read this book in Dutch (I heard that it is better edited), though I prefer to read books in English (it helps me to get in the \\"fantasy world\\" of the books) Anyway I borrowed the book from a friend, because of all the bad reviews. (Why spend money for a possible bad book?)<br /><br />But... Altough i'm not into that BDSM stuff, i liked the story. And wanting to read more.<br /><br />You will either love it or hate it, I guess :-)<br /><br />I like the fact that the man and woman in this story are not perfect. He is so troubled and she is so unexperienced. I can't wait for the happy ending in wich they will find their compromise.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. Works great and I have had nothing to complain about. Love that I can create a pin from the share page menu.
006197806X|4.0|It's been a while since I had read Delirium (the first book), but Pandemonium delivered a great follow up to the series. First off, Pandemonium is completely different from the first book with many changes in Lena's life. This book tells Lena's journey into the wilds in the beginning where the last book ended, and her current life. There were some parts where that were confusing that I had to re-read to understand what was going on. Otherwise I would certainly recommend this book to fan's of the whole dystopian obsession. For fans of the Hunger Games, this book has a lot of action from the middle to the end of the book. There is some minor romance like Matched but mostly it's pretty mild. If you're a person who reads the last page of the book, DON'T DO IT!! The ending completely threw me off and I enjoyed the book 10x more.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|It was OK after you've watched it and think about it, but during the first initial viewing I must admit I was a bit ancy in my seat. The problem was I had minimal sympathies for the leads, and the movie producers take it for granted that you care very much for anything that walks on two legs. Perhaps that's the way life should be to care for our fellow man, but in movies it's a whole different category.  You have to connect. Without that, you simply watching someone else's journey, and that's how it was during this entire movie. I feel for people who are in pain or distress in movies but there are certain levels of rooting for the good guy. The major point is putting yourself in his or her spot, that is where the real fun comes in. However, in this particular case, I felt like I was a watcher in someone else's nightmare, and as struggling as she was to find her lost daughter, I didn't feel it was monumentally that important. I felt more importance in Dorothy finding her way home from the wonderful land of Oz. That is the real clincher with horror movies, if you don't empathize with the main characters, the struggle is lost. For all the special effects, sound effects, fancy footwork to behold, the feeling was rather cold as the white ash almost deserted city she had visited.<br />As for the villains, they ranged from a Katherine Hepburn African Queen wannabe to Michael Jackson's floating mummies. Nuf said.
B004N6369Y|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  All of Daniel Steele's books are interesting and the characters very interesting and likable.  It is easy to relate to the story line and characters. I recommend this book to any of her readers and any non-readers of her books. She is a great author.....
B005CMSDLE|3.0|Very interesting premise for a movie, but it was the ending that left me wanting more.  Kate Blanchet is a wonderful actress and her southern drawl may be a bit heavy at times, but you would never guess she was english.  There is also a lot going on with Kates character but we are only given snippets and no explanation of all the little quirks in her life.<br /><br />I would say more about the plot, but do not want to give anything away..
B007N8RULO|4.0|its really fun and just like the computer game! the ads are the only down side to getting. the app&bull; fun!

B007KOYEOC|1.0|Nothing like the first 2 books.  I felt it was amateur writing and not worth reading....I dont recommend this book..
0812993292|5.0|I won't repeat the book's story as so many others here have already done so.  However, it's worth noting that the story builds slowly - very, very slowly.  The first third is very, very slow and I might have been tempted not to continue but it was a book club selection so I persevered.  It turned out to be one of those rare and memorable books that gets better as it goes along.  Wonderful characters, interesting plot (with a real surprise towards the end) and beautifully told.  At times, Harold's quest reminded me of Ulysses, with Maureen as Penelope.  Or, possibly, other iconic heroes engaged in a quest.  At others, it seemed to be a fable, reminding me of some of Alice Hoffman's books.<br /><br />I recommend this as a book club selection since there is so much to discuss, both in terms of themes ( redemption, loneliness, communication, the kindness of people, the contrast between the natural world and the civilized one, et al) and characters.  Many people commented on the Booker prize winner by Julian Barnes; it seems to me that this one could evoke a similar outpouring....
0385484518|5.0|thanks. the book came on time and its in wonderful shape..I do like this book I started reading it the moment I received oit.

B000007WNN|1.0|Apart from Love Removal Machine and Lil Devil, the album is a collection of the most throw away riffs and rejected type songs. There is nothing above average about Peace Dog and Wild Flower either. Even Born into this sounds more interesting than this (I'm working backwards through some of Cult's stuff), so maybe that's why the fans who like that album say it's \\"as good as\\" Electric? I'm a fan of albums from before and after Electric, meaning the different sounding styles of the band but I'm put off by this. Really mediocre.
B007SGM084|5.0|Such a sweet story! I would purcase again.  Books were easy to load to kindle. Have recommended to all my friends.
0515142247|1.0|I have never read a Lee Child's book and purchased this with high hopes after hearing him compared to Stephen Hunter, a writer I love to read.  Not even close!  First off, a writer should have a basic understanding of his subject matter.  Lee Child does not.  Even his basic descriptions are inaccurate, like repeatedly describing semi-automatic pistols as \\"automatics\\", or describing a bolt-action rifle as \\"rapid fire\\".  Does he not know how a bolt action rifle or semi-automatic handgun works?  Small details will ruin a book for me.  When he describes a character removing the safety from a Sig Sauer pistol, it makes me wonder how much he researches his books (Sig Sauers have no safety).  Or when he inaccurately describes the iron sight system on an M-16 rifle it shows his lack of basic knowledge regarding firearms.  It is quite obvious Mr. Child has never touched or fired a gun in his life.<br /><br />That could be acceptable if the rest of the book wasn't chock full of errors and poor representations.  The author portrays the FBI agents as underpaid, corrupt and incompetent, who run around in the woods in suits and dress shoes carrying .38 revolvers as their weapons, and driving used sedans or their own personal cars.  Is he writing about agents from the 1930s?  FBI agents make $140,000/year and they don't send three off into the woods in 3 piece suits to tackle an armed militia.  One agent decides to sell out his partners and his country so he can have a new $35,000 Ford Explorer.  Pathetic.<br /><br />His portrayal of the militia members is also sophomoric and not well fleshed out.  And he does an equally poor job describing the US military characters.<br /><br />In several scenes his main hero, Reacher who comes from an \\"elite\\" military unit (for Mr. Child's information, military police are not considered elite commando units in the US military), is running low on ammunition, but leaves behind fully loaded weapons and spare magazines as he does battle.  In one scene Reacher decides to talk down two attack dogs, rather than kill them, and he somehow succeeds.  The errors are much more numerous, and too many to recall or list here.  This book stretches the bounds of common sense, and was hard to read.<br /><br />The writing was average, the plot line was terrible, and the characters made no sense.  It is obvious Lee Child is a NYC writer who is trying to compose a book with characters and topics he doesn't have the slightest clue about.<br /><br />If you have read all of Stephen Hunter's novels, finished Vince Flynn, Brad Thor, Tom Clancy, WEB Griffin, and several other much more worthy novelists, and you have a few days to kill without caring too much about an accurate plot line or well thought out characters, read this book.  But save your money and get it from your local library.  It was a dud.

B001QOGYBI|5.0|I haven't read Roald Dahl's book that this was based on, but if this movie is anything like it, I shall definitely be picking up a copy at some point in the future. Charming is an excellent word for the film, which has all the lyrical quirkiness we've come to expect of Anderson and his films, whether it be Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Aquatic Life, or his latest effort, Moonrise Kingdom.<br /><br />Besides its quick pace and wit -- and the feeling that it's packed with about 3 times the plot of many live-action films today -- it also has a great voice cast in George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon, not to mention some talented unknowns. The writing is funny, insightful, and clever, and again moves at a breezy clip, just like the movie.<br /><br />The style of stop-motion animation is another high point. Its feel and costuming seems to recall stop-motion techniques from films back in the 1940s and '50s, a kind of retro look that you might get from some of the haunting short animated films of that age, whether it be from artist behind the iron curtain or from the imagination of George Pal (later the creator of blockbuster films like Destination Moon, War of the Worlds, and The Time Machine).<br /><br />Either way, this is a film you can watch with the entire family and come away enthralled.

B00008GKEG|5.0|The following is a reprint of my 2003 review of the DVD set which had just then recently been released.<br /><br />Back in January 2000, I reviewed this box set here (see \\"If You Liked the TV Special, You'll Love This!\\"). 3 years later, many Beatles fans' prayers (including my own) were answered with the release of this video library in DVD form. Rather than resay what I said back then, I just thought I'd write with a different perspective. The opening statement is from the liner notes of Derek Taylor, who served as the Beatles' press agent.<br /><br />To answer a recent review, here's what's on it: performances of the Beatles live in concert and television performances (not complete concerts), some original videos, narrated by Sir Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, the late George Harrison (who was still around during the making of this documentary) and the late John Lennon (his comments are culled by old interviews), excerpts from early recordings, studio outtakes, press conferences and all 5 of their movies and finally, over 30 complete Beatles tracks (By the way, \\"Real Love\\" is included in this edition).<br /><br />The sound quality is superior here than the original VHS (and you have the option of LPCM Stereo, Dolby Digital surround sound and DTS 5.1 surround sound). You also have the option of subtitles in English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese (Brazilian and European). Just don't expect your Linguistics teachers to be impressed with how many French or Spanish words you learned while watching this!<br /><br />It is a bit of a shame that individual tracks weren't assembled for complete songs. Oh well, a minor disappointment! Keep in mind that the 8 video VHS box set was actually pricier than the 5 DVD box set back when it was released in 1996 (I remember paying nearly double for mine!).<br /><br />Then of course, there's the Special Features DVD. In addition to the \\"Real Love\\" video (which wasn't included on the original VHS edition), there's a segment in which Paul, George and Ringo all gather together in 1994 to discuss the old days and jam out on old songs. The 3 are also featured here in 1995 discussing with George Martin, their producer, the choosing of different outtakes on the 3 Anthology CD's and studio techniques they used during the original recording sessions. Paul, George and Ringo also discuss with Jeff Lynne how a Beatles mini-\\"reunion\\" took place with 2 John Lennon demos (\\"Free As a Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\"). Also, there's a section on how many hours of interviews and classic footage came together for this documentary and a feature on how the \\"Free as a Bird\\" video was made.<br /><br />Give yourself at least 2 weeks to enjoy as the late Derek Taylor once put it these \\"10 hours of unchallengable evidence\\" of the Beatles' legacy, which continues even to this day.<br /><br />Note: While I'm not sure a Blu-Ray release is in the planning, it would be cool to see. They could include the \\"director's cut\\" and commentary from all who participated (and are still alive to tell).
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|For the most part this is just an amazing album. Carlos moves away from the predictable latin rock to make a truly inspring, artisitc, creative record. In all likelyhood the people trashing it don't want him to take risks. They like those 'Santana' group records and all they've come to expect. If you liked his more adventuorous works and were waiting for him to play music again with that sense of adventure and surprise, this is it!  He's regained his artistic integrity again. There's a song or two that are like phoned in performances but what's great here is really great!  Do yourself a favor and get this release. It's like discovering Santana again for the first time. He should be very proud of this wonderful record and I'm sure he is.  He's still got the fire in his belly and a devotional love of music. Take the journey, get the disc.
B008XG1X18|3.0|When I can get the app to work properly it is great.  However sometimes it takes a lot of tries to get it to launch without it doing a force close a ton of times. It will even force close while you are using the app and that is very frustrating.  Works great on a smart phone tho.

0393316041|5.0|After reading this book, Feynman became my hero. He is a genius in all the ways I believe categorizes one: he's incredibly intelligent, he has an insatiable curiosity, and he's able to speak of the topics he knows about in a candid, straightforward way.<br /><br />And a plus is that he's hilarious. The adventures in this book were almost unreal. I came away with tons of cool stories, trivia, and historical knowledge that I was able to share with others. I immediately picked up the other books about Feynman, but this one is the best. I'd recommend it to just about anyone. It's an easy read, and rare for a book about a science guy, not religiously deprecating. I know Feynman isn't a theist, and he makes very little allusions to religion in this book, but there's no God-bashing. These details alone don't detract me from reading a book, but it's something worthy of note for audiences on Amazon.

0446572993|4.0|This grabs you from the get-go and won't let you go. Baldacci's newest protagonist is an assassin, whose missions usually eliminate really bad people. He doesn't usually know a lot about his victims, only that the world will be a better place without them.  One can't help but like Will Robie, and feel sorry for him. He can never let his guard down and be normal, can't fall in love, can't settle down. His conscience doesn't bother him because he does what he does best, and that is eliminate the scum of the world. It's not about the money, but the mission. It's his lot in life.<br /><br />When he is faced with a questionable mission that doesn't seem to fit the usual parameters, he is faced with hard choices.  The choice he makes is sudden, and changes his life drastically. Now he is the hunted, and the novel revolves around the ramification of his choices, and intersects the lives of many, including a 14-year old girl running from her parents killers.<br /><br />Baldacci also does what he does best. His characters are well developed and realistically human, the pace is fast, the situation complex, and the suspense keeps you riveted. Don't start this late at night or you will be up way longer than you intended to be.<br /><br />Highly recommended for thriller fans.
B004EBZX6W|3.0|It works but is not as sensitive as it should be, I get much better results with inSIDDer.  I do like the meter function, it helps a lot when you want to walk in the strongest direction. I do not know why it does not show other signals when I can see them on the phone wifi selection. I have gone through the settings several times and nothing seems to get them to show up. But it was only .99 so I guess the meter function is worth that.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like this app for keeping track of my battery time as I have two children in my home that use my Kindle Fire quite a bit and tend to run the battery down without my knowledge...I really like that it can announce when the battery is fully charged or only is 50%, etc.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|simple to use yet informative.  shows temp and various time descriptions. faster to use then looking up the battery status under device.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Oh, jeez. I didn't think that I would like this, but I sat down and recorded it anyway, because if a movie isn't good, it's still fun to make fun of it. So I sat down on the couch and settled in with a roll of the eyes and then-- BAM! I was caught in this onslaught of music and insanity and the best costumes I've ever seen. There are no words for how wonderful this movie is... I admit I am now completely obsessed with it! I also have to admit I admire sopranos: I'm an alto, so in some of those parts I was like, YIKES! Emmy was amazing as Christine. What's this I hear about her being 17? Wow. And Gerard Butler... I know some people are gonna say, oh, he wasn't as good as what's-his name, but I don't agree. Both Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler were, in my opinion, better suited to the roles. And Minnie Driver was really good at the acting of Carlotta, even though she was dubbed by a soprano. But what I'm wondering is, why is there a horse in the sewers? That's a little odd, don't you think? Anyway, it made me get all teary-eyed, which movies don't ever do, so I'm happy. **sighs** I've watched this a lot this weekend and haven't gotten tired of it.<br />I completely understood the character of the Phantom, why he did the things he did. That little bit of backstory did a world of good. Raoul (Patrick Wilson) was a little bland, but that wasn't his acting, he just didn't have the psychology he needed to flesh out the character. Christine was a little naïve for my taste, but again, that was the character, not the acting. I love the ending, it's so great that the Phantom has never lost his love for Christine. It's kind of an Awwww moment.<br />Anyway, thanks for reading my review!<br />~Harpingonforever

0545259088|5.0|I have an interesting history with this book. I started reading this series right after this book came out, which was right around the time Borders was closing (where I was working).  I quickly read my way through books one and two, finding them really thoughtfully written for books in the Young Adult section. I had thought I had tucked away a copy of the third book only to find in my haste I had just put another copy of the second book, in hard cover, in my reading stash.<br /><br />The store closed down and I was never able to get a copy that way. Luckily it showed up on the Vine reading list not too much later and I finally had a copy to read. I wasn't ready to part ways with the story or my own story of reading the book in my beloved store at first, so I only just read it a few weeks ago, as the one year anniversary of the closure of Borders approaches.<br /><br />Done with the personal prologue-- onto what I thought of the book.<br /><br />Having been almost a year since I had spent time with these characters it took me a few chapters to remember what was going on and who was who. However, once that was done I found myself, for the first time in months just laying on the couch turning pages and reading my way through a book almost in one sitting. I read the authors' newest book, [[ASIN:054522490X The Scorpio Races]]  not too long ago and thought it was amazing. This just continues to cement my opinion of her work. It is a Young Adult novel, its about growing up and struggles with parents and parental figures. However, her writing is so superior to so many who work in the genre. She quotes Rilke often and they aren't just throw away 'look I'm quoting someone famous' quotes. They are relevant to the story and the characters.<br /><br />I love how thoughtful her characters are and how self aware they become, which is what growing up is about. She literally has here characters struggling to be comfortable in their own skin as they struggle with werewolf-hood.<br /><br />That she can switch voices between the characters and really have us know exactly which character is speaking is amazing. I'm often turned off by first person narratives because while many people find them really easy to write in it is the hardest to successfully write. A writer has to create a voice other than their own and that is hard when using words like \\"I.\\" She does it with four different characters in this novel and each one has its own eloquence.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book, and this series, for ages 14 and up. It does involve death, sex (though nothing that steamy) and violence as well as instances of what can be seen as teen rebellion.<br /><br />It wraps up the trilogy really well and makes you want to read the whole series over again, just to reexamine what you thought you knew about some characters.<br />That she can switch voices between the characters and really have us know exactly which character is speaking is amazing.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|A really genuine story, great and strong characters and lots of little details about everyone and everything. And a lot better than the TV series (devil's in the details). Kindle edition is great, without any sort of mistakes or flaws that I've been able to notice while reading the book.
1609611543|4.0|I picked up a copy of Wheat Belly 4 weeks ago.  I had been doing the \\"gluten free\\" thing for a few weeks, with no results, and even some weight GAIN!  I was so disappointed!  I am an active person, I go to the gym 5-6 days a week and I couldn't understand it!  After reading the reviews, I figured I had nothing to lose, well hopefully nothing but weight!  In 4 weeks, I have lost around 16lbs! Which is AMAZING!  I have hypothyroidism and weight loss, even with thyroid medication and diet and exercise, is an uphill battle.  Wheat Belly changed my life.  Nothing I have done until now has worked as quickly or effectively.  In addition to the weight loss, I feel a thousand times better, and I am NEVER hungry.  I used to have to have snacks between meals, and now, by eating real food, whole foods, full fat foods, I am satisfied by my meals.  The recipes in the book are delicious, especially the cheesecake.  I make one a week.  No \\"diet\\" I have ever been on has \\"allowed\\" cheesecake!  Now I have a piece every day.  The only complaint I have is that there aren't a lot of recipes.  I can't wait for the cookbook to come out!!!<br />This book is not a \\"diet plan\\"; it's a lifestyle plan.  I will never go back to eating wheat.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Dr. Davis!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its fun.... wish updates would come just a bit faster though.... some of the games were really challenging but over all just kept me amussed
B0073PZIBQ|5.0|Surprised but extremely happy.  Finally, a movie that shows birders as we really are.  Nerdy, competitive and driven by an obsession that is difficult to explain.  As a long time birder I read the [[ASIN:0965901343 book]] that this movie is based on many years ago.  I remember thinking, this would make a really good movie, but no one would even think of making it.  I was shocked when I found out that not only was it being made but that the cast included Steve Martin (who kind of looks like many real birders that I know) and Jack Black (who doesn't).  I stood in line at the theater the day that it was released and have watched it many times since.  I doesn't surprise me that the movie received mixed reviews.<br /><br />This is a comedy that provides very few big laughs, it's more whimsical than hilarious.  It is much more like real life than a Hollywood comedy and I am sure that this has disappointed more than one cinema-goer.  However, for birders this is a movie that we can really relate to.  Great remote locations; scores of bird names that only those that have studied their [[ASIN:0618966145 Peterson's]] or their [[ASIN:0679451226 Sibley's]] would recognize; and a lot of beautiful shots of  gorgeous birds.  Everyone who knows the feeling of standing in the middle of nowhere before the sun has risen on a cold spring morning waiting for a glimpse of a rare migrant should embrace this movie because it will probably be a long time before another picture about us is made.

B000UE29SW|5.0|I bought this book many years ago. It was so profound that I bought everyone in my family one for Christmas that year. Shortly after reading this book my father who was not much into church or the bible, decided to start going to church with my mother and he ended up being baptized etc... This book truly changed several people who have read it. To me it was a confirmation of exactly what I always thought heaven would be like when I get there.  Anyone that has lost loved ones, this book is a MUST to read, by the end of the book you will envy where they are, you will be excited to know that one day you will be there as well with them. Thank you Betty for sharing this with the world. :)
B001MKQS4O|5.0|in every movie he's in. and capote is no exception. i had read about the impetus for capotes book, and thought it rather grim. the idea of befriending murderers and spending four years of ones life with them in effort to write one's magnum opus seems a very, very hefty compromise. it ruined truman. how could it not?<br /><br />i immediately purchased a copy of in cold blood to hear it in truman's own voice. there is evidently another movie about truman's life and the writing of in cold blood that people give impressive nods to which might be worth viewing as well. the cast of capote, the cinematography, all of it a masterpiece even given the grim setting.
B0059R5Q08|5.0|This is a beautiful adaptation of a very dark and dismal book - Faasbender plays the tormented, star-struck, proper Englishman very well.<br /><br />The whole cast is brilliant!  You will watch this over and over again; I know I do.

0345803485|1.0|I bought the trilogy because the media was insisting. I had to read for myself why these books were taking over everyone's lives.  Fifty Shades (book 1) kept my attention because I was trying to figure it all out.  The sex was somewhat taboo but not as bad as I had expected.  By the end of the first book, I was beginning to be insulted with the lack of good writing.  The same words used repetitively, unrealistic sex to the point of ad nauseam, a shallow, ignorant female lead, and a storyline that amounted to nothing.  I read the 2nd book simply because I had paid money for it.  I could barely make it through.  I refuse to read the third.  Don't waste your time or money on these books.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a solid book, but not as strong as Flynn's other work. The characters were weaker, the plot not as compelling, and overall it felt fluffier. The ending in particular felt like a cop-out to me. It was still a good read, and better than loads of other stuff out there, it just wasn't as cutting and energetic as Dark Places and Sharp Objects. If I'd read this book first, I would have enjoyed it enough to seek out the author's other work, but reading this after her earlier novels left me disappointed.
B008N1LL42|2.0|I wasn't expecting much from a movie named after a board game, but wow!  This was quite possibly the stupidest movie I have ever seen.  It was literally impossible to suspend disbelief.  The plots made no sense.  The characters actions made no sense.  By the end, I felt the aliens deserved to win because humans had made this movie.<br /><br />I will say the use of actual veterans and injured veterans was the only thing good about this movie.  That is something that movies should do more of.
B00543RC0Y|5.0|For fantasy lovers of all ages. Took my grandson to see the first movie when it first came out. It was the first movie he ever sat through without taking his eyes off the screen.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Exactly what I wanted. Pristine Blu Ray's of each movie without having to sell a kidney to buy them. Box contains all 3 movies without a dvd or a digital copy.<br /><br />The picture quality is amazing. When I put in the first Toy Story movie, I was amazed at how great the quality of the picture and audio were.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I was ever disapointed with this book. I didn't read the reviews for book 4 because I had enjoyed the other 3 so much.But this book was divied into two books which I would have liked to know before I got to the end of the book. Goes to show the writter was after the money not the reader. I have not bought book five for that reason.

B00701QTOI|5.0|15 songs created as if they were to be on rock radio but without the vocals.  14 songs with a full band plus the last song takes us out with his solo guitar in a leisurely, farewell to the album way.  All other compositions blend and maintain strong melodies with deft drum and bass work that does not overpower at any point the guitars.  This album surprised me as I expected virtuoso moments, eclectic explorations, and long jams (and sometimes these elements work and sometimes they don't).  We don't get any of that here.  We get short, radio friendly and enjoyable to listen to song compositions.  You can intensely focus on and listen to this and get excited or you can mellow out and let it hang enjoyably in the background.  Either way this album works.  As far as a lot of the new to me stuff that I've been listening to lately (around 30 or so albums from a variety of genres) this is the one that I have probably enjoyed the most.  And it goes down easy, like a cold glass of water on a sweat-of-your-brow type of day.  Just think.  Almost 15 years later and people are still discovering and writing about this album.  Good one, Joe.
B005LAIGIM|2.0|I used to love Eddie Murphy.  Lately, he is just plain terrible.  This movie sucks and it was pretty much a waste of time.
1400032717|4.0|For me, this was a page turner. I immediately figured out that the POV comes from an autistic teen boy who finds his neighbor's dog, Wellington dead. Murdered. Thus, the boy is so undone by this he sets out to solve the murder but ends up solving WAY<br /> more than that. The voice is funny (though not meaning to be) ...think Rain Man but younger and funnier. The way Christopher goes about solving the murder (which does provide quite an interesting platform for us to learn the back story) keeps the reader engaged and curious. I had strong feelings for the father and Christopher, both loving and disliking them. And knowing all the while, it wasn't their fault.<br /><br />Quite a feat, I think, for the author to take on such a difficult POV and be so true to it throughout. I learned a lot in the process and that is always a plus for me. Autism seems to be more prolific and I have seen melt downs in public places between parents and children and didn't understand what was going on. I felt that the circumstances as well as the ending were well portrayed and done with great care and perfection.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|This game is identical to Greedy Spiders (1), but essentially adds a couple of new levels. That's nice for FAOTD customers, but if I had bought the original game, I'd be a bit miffed. Rovio keeps adding levels to their Angry Birds franchise, and even Disney has extended Where's My Water once.<br />That said, the game is playable and a tad easier than the first version. However, I saw two ANRs when starting the game on my Galaxy Nexus and a Force Close on the Kindle Fire during game play.
B005LAIHPY|1.0|There is some problem with the Blu-ray disc. Seems to be for Chapters 1 & 2 only. Rest of the chapters are ok. Tried this on 2 different Blu-ray (different brands) players. The show keeps \\"pausing\\" for a few seconds after every few minutes. In Chapter 1, the strange \\"pausing\\" begins when Hopper looks through the glass door of the convenience store (for the chicken burrito). In Chapter 2, it happens as Hopper kicks the ball during the penalty kick. Once it happens (both locations) it keeps at it for a good 3-5 minutes then automatically skips to the next chapter! Anyone else encountered this problem?

B007JVJ3C4|1.0|But even if Mike Nelson & Co. never get together to tear this movie apart, it's still watchable in a so-bad-it's-good way.<br /><br />Everyone knows Nicholas Cage will take any project that comes his way, but this one was particularly ill-conceived. There is, in fact, no story to be found in this movie. Oh, there's a vague outline for a terrible story here, and that's what they used as a shooting script. See, the Devil has a son with a Gypsy woman (or something), and he wants to take over the kid's body because his current body is only human and dying, but the kid's body is half-devil and immortal, I guess. There's a mobster guy who looks like a 24-year-old Jim Carrey (with a slightly better haircut) who is tasked with retrieving the kid for Satan. And Ghost Rider is there for some reason, and an African guy who, I think, used to have devil powers, but prayed them away, maybe (I guess that's supposed to be some kind of cultural commentary). And the mobster turns into Edgar Winters at one point, and gains the power to make things moldy. No, really. He takes a sandwich out of a lunchbox as he drives and makes it moldy. Also, he kills the African guy by making him moldy.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage looks about 20 years older in this movie than he did in the original Ghost Rider. He also has begun to look like k.d. lang with a receding hairline, which is weird.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance has no Vengeance in it. It's wholly lacking in any kind of Vengeance, even the Spirit of it. It does feature some extremely jerky camera work, though, and bizarre visual asides. The CGI is singularly lacking, and seeing the terrible special effects it becomes obvious that most of the film's $57 million budget went towards Cage's salary and Botox injections. We do get to witness a scene that goes on for like, five minutes, in which we watch Nick ride his motorcycle and have some kind of spazz-attack while his face repeatedly changes into a semi-skull and back, which is somehow less dramatic than you'd think.<br /><br />Also, apparently, the Ghost Rider pees fire. No, really. I'm serious! They show it like, three times. I couldn't say why. You'll just have to watch it if you don't believe me.<br /><br />The best scene is one in which Nicholas Cage has lost his powers to Ghost-Ride because he prayed, or something, and Satan is about to kill him, but then the kid (who doesn't want to be possessed by his devil-dad, I guess) vomits fire on Johnny Blaze's face, which makes him able to Ghost-Ride again, only now his head-fire is blue instead of orange. So, there's that.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about this movie is that I made it all the way through, which I can't say for The Green Hornet. Anyway, if you do decide to watch this, it'll go a lot easier if you take a shot of tequila every time Cage looks mournful and regrets his Ghost-Riding. You'll only make it about 20 minutes.ull and back, which is somehow less dramatic than you'd think.<br /><br />Also, apparently, the Ghost Rider pees fire. No, really. I'm serious!

038533348X|4.0|Despite having read \\"Cat's Cradle\\" years ago, I recently found myself drawing a blank over the novel. I recalled that it was a 1960s doomsday satire (like Dr. Strangelove), a religious satire about a fake religion called Bokononism, and a political satire about a U.S. backed Caribbean dictatorship, San Lorenzo. Yet I couldn't quite recall what exactly Vonnegut was trying to say in this one, so I decided to reread it.<br /><br />The first theme of this book consists of Vonnegut's warnings about the awesome destructive force of science, and the abdication of moral responsibility by scientists. The plot centers around the deceased scientist Felix Hoenniker, a researcher at the General Forge and Foundry Company of Ilium, New York (modeled on Vonnegut's experiences at General Electric in Schenedtady), and winner of the Nobel Prize (\\"dynamite money\\"). Hoenniker was the father of the atomic bomb, and as if that isn't enough guilt for one man's soul (\\"how the hell innocent is a man who helps make a thing like an atomic bomb?\\"), he was also the developer of 'Ice-9', a form of ice with an elevated melting point. As Ice-9 has the potential to freeze the world's oceans, it is an even greater threat to humanity than the atom bomb. To Vonnegut, Hoenikker, and modern science and industry \\"receive honors and creature comforts while escaping human responsibilities.\\"<br /><br />The second major theme of Cat's Cradle is an exploration of false ideology. This is signified with the title string-trick, in which there is \\"no damn cat, no damn cradle\\". The book centers around a fabricated religion designed to give the impoverished people sustenance - one might say the opium of the masses, based around useful lies, or \\"foma'. Bokononism is itself sharply critical of the meaningless \\"granfaloons\\" that we use to divide and categorize people, including \\"the Communist Party, the Daughers of the American Revolution, the General Electric Company... and any nation, anytime, anywhere\\". Cornell University is another such granfaloon, as are \\"Hoosiers\\". Vonnegut is, as always, particularly derisive of American nationalism and militarism (e.g. \\"Fort Jesus\\"). Much of this criticism is conveyed through the unusual American Ambassador to San Lorenzo, Horlick Minton (\\"Perhaps when we remember wars we should take off all our clothes and... go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory and shows of flags and well-oiled guns\\"). And, as usual for Vonnegut, there are a number of jabs at capitalist ideology, mainly through the character of H. Lowe Crosby, who is in the process of relocating his bicycle factory to San Lorenzo, whose workers are impoverished and sufficiently terrified of the capital punishment doled out by dictator \\"Papa\\" Monzano, courtesy of \\"the hook\\". \\"No Communists here,\\" said Papa. \\"They fear the hook too much.\\" Bokononism is also a hook-worthy offense. Or more accurately, \\"Hy-u-ook-kuh!\\"<br /><br />I suppose the third major theme is Vonnegut's absurdist outlook on human existence. Says Bokonon: \\"Dyot meet mat\\", or \\"God made mud\\", \\"So God said to some of the mud, 'Sit up!'\\", \\"What interesting other kinds of sitting up mud I met!\\" Yet Vonnegut's humanism occasionally shines through the bleak outlook: \\"Think of what a paradise this world would be if men were kind or wise.\\"

1439127700|2.0|I watched a discussion of this book with the two authors on PBS's News Hour and found the discussion intriguing.  Unfortunately, the book did not live up the the level of the conversation.  There were a few tidbits buried deep within the book, but for the most part it was a re-hash of well worn information available in many other books.<br /><br />I thought the parts about Truman and Hoover were perhaps the best and that may relfect that I know less about them than the other presidents mentioned.  I found almost all of the write ups on the more recent presidents (Reagan, Clinton, Bush, and Bush 2) to be boring.<br /><br />If you really like the presdientcy then this might be worth a read.  Try and pick up a used copy and save yourselves some cash.

030758836X|5.0|It has been a long time since a novel through me for such a turn as will happen in the murder mystery Gone Girl. The twist in this novel will have you caring for the characters and then despising them in the next moment.<br />The novel centers on Nick Dunne and the disapperance of his wife Amy. It becomes apparent early on that the picture perfect marraige is anything but and as time goes on Nick becomes the central figure in a murder investigation of his missing wife. Nick does little to make you care about him, even as you see the walls closing in, tidbits of who he really is comes to the surface and you begin to believe he could be the killer.<br />But then the truth of Amy begins to seep to the surface as well and then you are unsure of who is who and what is what. But you know you need to ride this one out because is Amy dead? Is she really missing? Did Nick kill her? Did Nick do anything but be a bad husband? And how bad was he really?<br />Gillian Flynn does a masterful job of dropping hints to the truth without ever revealing it until then she does and it leaves you questioning everything you have read for the last hundred pages. Yes the twists when they come, you won't see and they will be just like hitting the reset button. They are just that good.<br />If I seem ambigious in this review it is that I don't want to give any details of the story away. It is much more fun to find them out for yourself.<br />Pick it up and enjoy Gone Girl.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I was able to download and hear the song with no problem.<br />I was amazed and how easy it was.
B000056N8X|3.0|The movie definitely has it's flaws, but it's far better than The Quickening or The Source.<br /><br />To start with the villain is interesting, even if he's cheesy at times he's fun to watch. You can tell the actor had fun with the role. When he dies his quickening it pretty awesome too.<br /><br />I think the big thing here is Connor's death, I don't think they could have handled much better if they wanted to send him off. He goes out with a sincere and heartwarming goodbye as he makes the heroic sacrifice to give Duncan his power. It's really a sad and beautiful scene.
B003Y5H574|4.0|While this movie wasn't exactly what I expected going in, it still was rather enjoyable. Steve Corell finally managed not to ruin something he played in, that alone ought to be worth a watch.

1476712042|5.0|My friend loaned me this book on Kindle, and I loved it so much that I went out and bought it.  I loved Travis.  I loved their relationship.  In real life, would their behaviors be considered destructive & way to over the top, yes.  But this is a book, and it was fun to read.  Plus, their chemistry was HOT.  I am really excited about the next book being retold from his POV.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|I thought that this fourth film just might be the one that should not have been made but I was pleasantly surprised. Lots of fun and classic adult humor. Eugene Levy was great as always. Maybe another film where he and Stifler's mom take a vacation together? The empty nest syndrome?

B004HY3BTC|1.0|\\"Short Circuit 2\\" is even worse than the original (not to be confused with Werther's Original).<br /><br />The fundamental problem (and the reason for the one-star rating) is the utter lack of originality. The idea of a naive ... being ... being tricked into committing a crime was old 70 years ago. \\"Short Circuit 2\\" is unable to find any novel twist on this. It grinds through its shopworn plot as mechanically as the first film.<br /><br />And it does the unforgivable by breaking its own rules. Johnny's backup power drops low enough to permanently erase his memory -- but Ben uses a defibrilator (!!!) to restore him! (In real life (???), if memory is deleted, it's deleted. And a defibrilator jolt would blow out most of the robot's circuitry.)<br /><br />It doesn't help that (except for Ben) the casting is terrible and the overall tone childish. Like the original, this is a kiddie film -- this time, with a bit of vulgar language.<br /><br />It isn't even enjoyable as entertaining fluff. Emphatically not recommended.<br /><br />PS: I did enjoy the scene in which Johnny got the chip beat out of him.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|(Copied from my Amazon UK review).<br /><br />Blood Song is self-published author Anthony Ryan's debut release. The phrase \\"self-published fantasy\\" usually makes most people cautious, but it doesn't take long to realise that Ryan is actually an excellent writer, and Blood Song a superb novel that weaves a surprisingly complex tale. David Gemmell's influence can be clearly seen in the characters, and the world building is rich and satisfying.<br /><br />The book is centred around the life of one Vaelin Al Sorna, sent as a child to train amongst the warrior monks of the Realm's House of the Sixth Order. We see Vaelin's life as he gradually becomes a man amongst a band of brothers, as he battles hidden assassins, threats to the Realm, and the conflicting desires to serve his King and his Faith. Those desires eventually send him far from his monastery, to a defining confrontation on the shores of a distant empire. The characters are believably written, the combat is gritty and realistic, and the magic is subtle but powerful. The depth of the story is a pleasant surprise, and the conclusion, while very satisfying, leaves enough unanswered questions to make the reader look forward to the next in the series.<br /><br />At £1.91 (current Kindle price as of September 2012), this book is an absolute steal, and far better than many of the full priced hardbacks I've read this year. Highly, highly recommended.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|As an avid reader, I usually can't put a book down once I start it.  That still held true with Fifty Shades... I read all three books in the series, but was disappointed.  If you are looking for an extremely light read, I may recommend it.  If you feel like your sex life is dull, this may give you some ideas, but I didn't think it was anything scandalous.  The books became very repetitive and predictable.  The constant drama was annoying, as was the lack of creativity.  If you like to keep up with pop culture, give it a shot.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Love this game. Very challenging at times and really makes you think. Sometimes I wish the hint wasn't an option as it is an easy out of a sticky situation (pun intended!). Works well on the Fire.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I'll be brief, as there are a lot of reviews that highlight the technical aspects of this processor. I replaced a five year old Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz processor with this model, and let me tell you, it makes an incredible difference. Night and day doesn't begin to describe it. As I was building my system, I knew that I wanted an overclock, and the factory cooler just wouldn't do the job. I installed a [[ASIN:B002G1YPH0 Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus CPU Cooler with Four Direct Contact Heat Pipes (RR-B10-212P-G1)]], which at less than $30, is a simple upgrade that makes a HUGE difference in processor cooling capability.<br /><br />Overclocking report: runs fine at 4.4 GHz at stock voltages. I could certainly start bumping up voltage a couple spots and squeeze a little more speed out of this proc, but if you look at temperature vs voltage charts for Ivy bridge procs, they really start taking off once you go a few spots above stock voltage. The cost-benefit for me just didn't add up. Here are some numbers:<br /><br />Original speed: 3.4 GHz<br />Overclocked speed: 4.4 GHz<br />Voltage, as reported by CPU-Z: 1.15-1.16<br />Peak temperature Prime95 for 1 hour: 66c<br />Peak temperature under normal use: 52c<br /><br />So I am well within the appropriate temperature range for this processor. My case and airflow design may have something to do with that, so consider that carefully when building a system. I have 3 80mm and 1 120mm filtered fans blowing in, and two 120mm fans blowing out. Positive pressure design, keeps dust out, but tons of airflow.<br /><br />This review went a LOT longer than I thought, so here's the conclusion. If you need a new processor, and want something that can handle just about everything you could throw at it, there is no bigger bang-for-the-buck deal than this model. Spend the time to research every component of your build though, as it will only be as good as the weakest link.

1416979174|5.0|My daughter checked this book out from the library and we have read it over and over. (she chose the book herself.) I think it is actually pretty accurate yet metaphorical, and honestly, she understands the deeper meaning of the story. We do a lot of gardening and nature exploring and she knows that most seeds don't germinate, things fade and fall apart and become new things. She really likes the seasons and cycles of life aspects as well.<br /><br />Personally, I like that the \\"first\\" and the \\"best\\" don't win-- that the small persistent seed who is the most resourceful survives and outshines the bigger badder seeds and plants (this could also be because my child and I were always the smallest kids in the class and I was the last picked for the teams at recess, etc... But I grew up to be successful, happy and active, as had a lot of my \\"nerdier\\" friends)<br /><br />I think kids do not need to be shielded from life as some of the other reviewers said . Death and change are parts of life they are starting to be exposed to at this age-- their grandparents are aging, and many of them eill have pets pass on. Also, at this time they will start to enter school and will have to make that big transition.  Learning about the cycles of life thru a beautiful story is a good way to introduce these topics for discussion. I also do not think it is a violent book-- the seed gets eaten by a bird-- it isn't attacked by zombies or is shot by an invading alien army like 5 and 6 year olds seen in movies and video games...
B007SGM084|5.0|This book wasn't what I expected. From hearing everyone talk about it I thought it was going to be raunchy. It's not! This is a great love story. I laughed, cried, was anxious and there were exciting times in this book..all around great book. A must read.

0385344228|2.0|A page-turner? A surprise finish? A riveting tale? Not to me!<br />I was \\"shocked, shocked\\" to see so many glowing reviews from readers and blurbs from first-rate writers in the crime/mystery genre for so mediocre a book.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is implausible from the outset. At root, crime novels and police procedurals turn on plot, and this one goes south virtually from the beginning. We follow the action from the point of view of a father, Andy Barber, an assistant DA who takes the case of a murder in a classy Boston suburb involving a classmate of his son, Jacob. The storyline is unconvincing. A lawyer as committed to the concept of Justice, as Andy is, simply would not act as he does. Moreover, why would his one-time subordinate so gleefully pillory him and his colleagues hasten to join in heaping ignominy atop his already miserable circumstance. Nor can we believe Andy when in defense of his own missteps, he sites paternity. Not such a straight-shooter as Andy, someone whose substantial career has been built on public trust and putting one foot carefully in front of the other.<br /><br />Even more problematic, of course, is Jacob, Andy's son, ultimately accused of the murder. Landay accurately captures the language and attitude of Jacob and his adolescent peers, in their self-confident pose, dismissing adult interference and just wanting to be left alone. He is less good at capturing the vulnerability and uncertainty of youth, especially under the pressure these circumstance would bring to bear.<br /><br />Neither Jacob nor his friends, nor many of the adults act in ways consistent with their characters.  As the action and the lives effected by this tragedy hurtle towards the inevitable (to me) conclusion, it is the narrative that spins out of control.<br /><br />I thought this novel aspired to be a Mystic River, but it fell far short: on atmosphere, nuance and expectations.

Its a fun and crystal clear synopsis of the history of Western Philosophy that is just right for high school aged kids.  There are a few problems with some of the physics mentioned, but its not a physics book.  I'll keep buying it.

0307408833|3.0|I am trying to get better at gluten-free baking not only for myself, but for my daughter (who has a nut allergy, but I try to send allergen-free goods to school with her to share).  I'm a big fan of babycakes, and was very excited when this came out.<br /><br />Perhaps it's me, and I'm not overly experienced, but nothing I've tried so far has come out well.  Also, the majority of the books call for ingredients that are difficult to come by for me (evaporated cane juice, etc), so it's not easy to want to whip up a batch of muffins and actually have ingredients on hand (and as a vegan food blogger, I have a very well stocked pantry).<br /><br />All in all, I'd pass on this book in exchange for some of the other well-known allergy free baking books.

B000WZ33N4|4.0|I purchased this sheath as a replacement for a well worn and deteriorated original brown leather sheath included with the first generation Super Tool. Per the Leatherman website, this case is one of the ones recommended for that tool.  This replacement is not fitted snugly to the tool like the original case was, allowing the tool to shift around quite a bit in the main compartment.  Not a big deal, but I would have preferred a snugger fit.  As long as the flap is closed, the tool is still secure.  This brings me to another design decision I'm a bit disappointed in.  Leatherman chose velcro as the fastener on the flap.  Velcro inevitably wears out and gets weak after repeated attach and detach cycles.  If you're a person who simply carries a multitool to have around if a need arises, this is probably fine.  However, if you use it several times a day, you will likely wear out the velcro fairly quickly.  I personally would have preferred a snap closure and will likely rivet a snap to mine sooner or later.  My last minor gripe is that the two side pockets aren't really pockets, they're elastic tubes open at the bottom.  They're perfectly sized for a single AAA flashlight (I use one to carry an ITP A3), and as long as it has a pocket clip that can clip over the outside of the pocket everything would be fine.  However, you would likely lose anything that could fit in it and does not have another type of retention (for example a bit extension for those tools with bit drivers).  I do like the fact that the side pockets have tabs used to pull them open to make replacing the secondary tools easier.  The front and back pockets are just that, 3 sided pockets. Nothing really noteworthy about them, but they are a bit on the small side.<br />Overall, construction is very good and is a good value at the average selling price plus a few dollars for shipping.  Had it fit the original Super Tool better, used a snap on the flap, and had the bottoms of the side pockets sewn shut, it would easily get 5 stars from me.ld easily get 5 stars from me.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I picked up my first Harry Bosch book a couple of years ago because I had previously read one of Michael Connelly's books (not in the Bosch series) and enjoyed Connelly's writing skills and story telling abilities.  I found Harry Bosch to be a tough but thoroughly down-to-earth character.  The Last Coyote, in my opinion, is one of the best in the series.  I thought I \\"knew\\" Bosch fairly well, but I learned so much more about him while reading The Last Coyote. Although I had my suspicions about \\"who done it,\\" this book kept me \\"on my toes\\" almost until the end (rare since I can usually figure out the \\"bad guys\\" about half way through a good thriller).  This book enjoyed great characterization coupled with an interesting and different plot and caught me up in the story right away.  If you are familiar with Harry Bosch (or not), I think anyone who likes thrillers (or not) would like this one ... very good writing that keeps your mind \\"guessing\\" as you turn the pages.
0439023521|2.0|In my opinion this is little better than a child's book.  A lot of the ideas and concepts are nice, but the heroine does nothing proactive.  Much like modern sitcoms, there are several parts designed to draw out emotions, which it does well, however the book overall lacks substance.  Basically, it's a modern day Romeo and Juliette with a bit of a twist.
1583334386|5.0|I haven't read much of the book yet but I really enjoy the clarity of the writing and this is the first \\"self help\\" book I've read that jumped right in without the author droning on about themselves. seems like a winner already.

B0083TXXZ4|5.0|*****<br /><br />September 2, 2012<br /><br />This is SO much better than fighting with a regular Nerf gun.  For one thing - the most important thing - this gun doesn't run out of ammo anytime soon.  The darts just keep coming - assuming you've bought the full complement of darts and large-size clips-- till you've exhausted a whopping 144 of them.  By using the fusillade technique, recommended by all experienced Nerf warriors whenever it's available - you will almost certainly prevail against lesser armament.<br /><br />You aim more or less at your enemy and let loose with a barrage, and the chances are much better that with that one shot you'll hit someone.  If your target has taken refuge behind a sofa or a pregnant water buffalo, you can try raining down a fusillade from above with a better chance of a hit.<br /><br />I've found the accuracy of the Nerf N-Strike Elite Hail-Fire Blaster (Toy) to be somewhat worse than other Nerf guns', but with the natural spread of many darts instead of one, accuracy isn't as important.<br /><br />Unlike a real rifle this product cannot be fitted with a silencer.  It cannot be fitted with a telescopic sight or a laser sight.  The trigger-pull resistance cannot be adjusted.  The colors are pretty much the exact opposite of what you would call any form of camouflage unless you live on the planet Chromere V.  And it won't kill any deer you shoot with it.  For all these faults I subtract one star from five.<br /><br />But to buy the product under review you don't have to submit forms proving you should be given a permit to do so or endure a waiting period to get that permit.  It does not require (or permit, for that matter) regular maintenance such as disassembly and cleaning and oiling.  You can walk around a mall carrying one, fully loaded, out in the open or hidden under your clothes, without breaking any laws.  And it won't kill any deer you shoot with it.  For these benefits I add back that star.<br /><br />*****

B005IQZB14|2.0|I thought this book would contain more information about the PCT and a strong women's adventures on the trail, it turned out to be more like listening to someone go on and on about everything wrong with their life.<br />At first, it was fine, ok, that was really sad, you experienced the loss of your mother, but then it kept getting woven into every page in the book.<br />Then, I started to get a little annoyed thinking there are many, many more people in this world suffering much more than you. People with disabilities and other hardships that won't end. What's her problem again? The author is attractive and young and can do whatever she wants. Other than her mother dying, the other things that happen to her appear to be self inflicted.<br />Then, I start not liking the author and it gets so distracting I cannot enjoy the parts about the PCT.<br />Then the book goes into how many men she sleeps with, she cheated on your spouse, she was taking drugs, etc, etc.<br />I even started wondering, what kind of woman goes alone on the PCT, brings condoms with her, and then tells everyone she is alone on a nature trail with no one around (writing in the logs throughout the trail). The fact that nothing happened to her is really a miracle.<br />And, she constantly talks about how heavy her back pack is to carry, but yet she does not ditch anything in it.<br />I guess I am disappointed because I wanted a more inspirational story about a person overcoming hardships and really it was just someone telling bad things that happened to them.<br />Additionally, I could not believe she kept skipping the hard part of the trail, eating cheeseburgers, taking breaks to have sex and kept complaining.<br />So, read this one if you like to hear someone talk about their troubles while walking a very long distance.<br />If you want a better book that is non fiction and along the same lines, I would recommend, 'Here if you need me' by  Kate Braestrup.

Waters<br /><br />And with that begins the 92 minute opus based on one of the greatest, if not the greatest, concept album ever realized!<br /><br />But it was released some 30 years ago. Why bring it up now? Well...Why not? A work of art this important deserves all the attention it can get. And as sit here writing this I'm playing the album loud while my little girls play nearby. I'm very deliberate in the exposure because I want them to absorb it's brilliant nuances at their ripe young ages. \\"Mother will she tear your little boy apart? Mother will she break my heart?\\"<br /><br />For those of you too young or...for whatever reason, have not watched the Wall, please do so now! It's available on every format imaginable; VHS, Laserdisc, HD DVD, Blu Ray, Betamax, iTunes...you name it! And when you watch it ensure there are no interruptions. Turn off your cell, dim the lights and crank the mofo up loud. You will need to watch more than once. The first time to get the plot of a narcissistic rocker named Pink. Who, as a kid, was brought up by his old and out of date mother having lost his father to the war. He grew up in a `world within a world', not being able to assimilate with other kids his age and longing for a love and attention that constantly eluded him, Pink, of course, develops a talent for songwriting and attains fame. With that fame his descent into madness because absolute and the rest you can experience on your own.<br /><br />After the first viewing you will want to watch over. Each and every time you watch it again a layer of substance is shed, revealing another layer of substance more intriguing than the last. See `The Wall's\\" story really is about so many things. To me, being a parent, it's about how much power and influence we can have as parents and how we have the ability to really do some hardcore mental damage to our children if not careful. It's also a case study on how damaged our society is. How we idolize rock stars instead of teachers or doctors, or scientists. \\"The Wall\\" may have well been subtitled \\"The Decline of the Western Civilization- the Pink years\\" for it is every bit about how much rot has accumulated in our popular culture and how we are on a expressway trip to hell. Nothing new, right? But it's ultimately also a story of optimism that things can be different because it takes us on a first hand journey of what's wrong with us so we can know what's right. Ultimately, to me, \\"The Wall\\" is a cautionary tale on how not to raise your children...I know you were waiting for the optimism...There it is. Now go and do likewise boys and girls...<br /><br />I first saw the Wall in the late 80′s. I think 87 or 88. I gave it a 9 of 10 then. But the more I watched it the greater that number became. Out of the almost 200 films I own, \\"The Wall\\" is one of few that I have on my regular rotation list. I have it on my iPhone,  iPad, my i Mac, on Blu Ray and on DVD. I can watch it at anytime, anywhere and I often do. For every time I watch it I think of how my two little girls can gravitate towards someone as nihilistic and self destructive as Pink. I ponder the extent of my own anti socialistic tendencies and know how I must be better. How I must not fail my children. I bet Roger Waters and David Gilmour did not have that in mind when they sat down and fleshed out the album but I am ever so grateful and thankful they did.<br /><br />\\"Did you see the frightened ones?<br />Did you hear the falling bombs?<br />The flames are all gone, but the pain lingers on\\" - R.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|For the last 6 months, every time I turn on the radio, go to the library, even at work between customers and coworkers....it was nothing but all about 50 shades of Grey. I really wanted to know what the hype was all about and since everyone at work is telling me about this book, I had to read it. I already knew that this book is basically porn on paper. Don't get me wrong, I watch porn and I read fantasy, erotic books, so I don't mind a well written, sexy porn on paper literature. So I was actually looking forward to see what the hype was all about.<br /><br />Boy was I disappointed!!! The main character Christian is everything a girl can ever want. Rich, handsome, young, experienced in bed, arrogant but only has eyes for you with a touch of mystery and very dark. What's not to love? Christian is the ultimate alpha male! But the heroine....Ana....I have no words for her. She must be what 21 with the maturity of a 15 years old? She's insecure, naive, unintelligent and she does not seem like anyone attractive at all!!! What Christian sees in her, I really have no clue. Maybe her purity? Innocence? (Almost like in Twilight where Edward is soooo attracted to Bella but there was a reason to it. He can have a piece of quietness since Edward cannot hear Bella like he can read everyone else's mind, that's what attracted Edward to Bella) But there is no logical explanation as to what Christian would even possibly be attracted to this ordinary girl. But I'm not going to argue with the story. But the writing technique is unbearable!!! I peek up at him, Oh my, I bit my bottom lip, I flush, I blush, I murmured, crap, holy crap and double crap. It seems as though the author needs to learn some vocabularies. I myself never went to high school but even I know by adding an adjective in front of crap doesn't make it a whole another word or a different word altogether. I am only on chapter 8 and I couldn't continue. It's overly repetitive, redundant and extremely poor writing skills.<br /><br />The storyline isn't really that bad. It was kind of different than your everyday prince charming meets girl next door. I like how Christian is dark, mysterious, a little sick, and a whole lot of wild crazy sex. It was rather interesting. I would have really love to finish reading the story and see how the relationship between Christian and Ana were if the writing technique wasn't such a oh crap, holy crap, double crap and what a load of smelly crap. Oh my, I bit my bottom lip as I flush and I blush at my awful language, I murmured to myself......br /><br />The storyline isn't really that bad.

B006TTC5JK|3.0|The film Harvey is iconic thanks to Jimmy Stewart's signature performance. I enjoyed it as a kid and I enjoy it even more as an adult. That's the main reason the title gets the review it does (it's a five star film in my eyes), as the actual disc leaves some things to be desired. First off, the picture is certainly an improvement in some ways. The bright outdoor scenes are so fantastically rendered that they look like they could have been filmed yesterday. But as soon as the picture moves indoors, the amount of grain often became distracting and very digital looking. (And don't get me started on the opening titles.) Is some of this to be expected? Of course. The film was made in 1950, though for the record, I've seen some older films that came out looking better. Boy, would I love to be able to see this transfer next to one that does not use the \\"grain averaging\\" technique that Universal has employed for comparison. For bonus features, they are largely absent, aside from the trailer, a short interview with Stewart from the video release and a couple of unrelated pieces that tie in with the studio's 100th anniversary. The real way in which the blu fails miserably is that I have never seen such a horribly put together presentation come from a major studio and it very nearly drove me to rate it much, much lower. There is no main menu present at all. Even the Warner Bros titles that launched right into the feature had a menu screen that one could go to. With Harvey, you can only access pop-up menus while the film is playing. And if you have to stop the film for any reason, you have to start the entire process of going through their annoying trailers/warnings/advertisements/instructions again. At least that's been the case on my PS3. I've only had one other disc pull that stunt as I can recall (Sony's Men in Black) and it's so non-consumer friendly that it's maddening. It's so shoddy that I have to wonder if Universal's quality people were on vacation to let it slip through. It's inexcusable to put so little effort into the disc and I will be registering my complaint with the company about their home video department.

8866130885|5.0|Well I love these Moleskin calendars and buy a large weekly & pocket daily every year.  They are sturdy and hold up well in my busy, chaotic life!  This pocket weekly planner has \\"May he force be with you\\" imprinted in smooth black across the top, and Star Wars logo on the bottom outside. Inside front & back covers have lovely planet image & \\"I have a very bad feeling about this\\" quote from Luke Skywalker on the first right hand page. Otherwise pages are devoid of any Star Wars theme and have the full week Monday - Sunday running down the left side (with small space for each day to write appointments)and a blank lined page on the right that I like to use for tasks or notes.  A few pages in front for additional calendar planning 2013 & 2014, conversion charts, 4 lined notes pages in back ( would be nice if they were perforated, but they are not) and a  removable address book tucked in the back pocket.  It would have been nice to have a raised Star Wars related image on the front.  Otherwise I am very pleased with Moleskin's quality and durability and it's elegant look..  And, like I said, I love Star Wars!

B001OGWY1W|3.0|I love this movie. Its one of my favorite movies of all time. So I was GREATLY DISAPPOINTED when the movie began to skip and freeze right in the middle during the climax of the movie. I can't give it below a 3 because the film itself is great.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I started out not knowing if I was going to finish this book, then decided to read it, just because I'd started it, and, close to half way through, falling in love with it.  Most of my problems involved the main character.  I empathized with her and what was happening to her, but after the 3rd all out temper tantrum, I got more than a little tired of her yelling and screaming at everyone and everything.  I understood what was happening, and even why ...but enough is enough, and I had had *enough*.  then ...as books can unexpectedly do, this book plucked a chord in my soul, and I was lost.  I won't tell you what happened, just that the scene took place in a park ..but that was one of the most beautiful scenes I think I've read, and it ensured that book would become special enough to me that I bought the next in series.<br /><br />The mystery is good, even if the path to the resolution became a tad tortuous at times.  Still, I never stopped wanting to know everything, and while not entirely unexpected, the climax of the book made up for that in excitement and suspense.<br /><br />One thing I did like enormously, from beginning to end, was the wacky humor, which occasionally descends to something like slapstick, but is so funny that I found myself giggling, even in some less than appropriate events.  In addition, this is such a Southern book, and the writer nails that from the descriptions of places and people right down to the dialog, which is spot on.  She may live in MO ...but she's done time down South!  No one could get it so right unless they had!<br /><br />Ultimately this is a coming of age novel (though in this case, the coming of age is a bit ...accelerated), and the story entwined with the mystery is one of love in all its forms, and of the power of hope.  The end brought simultaneous tears and smiles ...and I am now *so* glad I didn't give up on this.

B008MBXFEM|5.0|From the opening heartbeat/Bat wing sounds to the powerful drums that accompany the final scene, this soundtrack serves as a great companion to 'The Dark Knight Rises'.<br /><br />Many tracks are lifted directly from the scenes, which is exactly what I wanted to hear. The soundtrack does not feature a particular drum/percussion pattern heard during the last 40 minutes of action, and that's my only gripe.<br /><br />The reviewers who complain about the songs \\"clipping\\" are either using bad stereo equipment or do not understand how horns and other live instruments work. Ambient noise from the live instruments do bleed into soundtracks. It happens all the time.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is one of the best biographies I have ever read. It is impossible to put this book down before finishing it. If you have Apple products, you look at them more carefully and appreciate so much what Steve Jobs did to perfect them. This book does what he expected it to do.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a book that I just couldn't put down. From the very beginning Crouch builds mystery and suspense, allowing more and more clues to fall into place as the story continues. But while some questions are answered, more questions are raised. At one point I thought I had it all figured out, only to find out I wasn't even close.<br /><br />Eventually we get all of our answers, but it's probably not what you expect. Not by a long shot.<br /><br />The characters were well-drawn and sympathetic and the tension is very, very real. Crouch plays mind games with his characters, to the point where I began to question what was and was not real.<br /><br />I made it through this book in two days. It's a quick, entertaining and thrilling read. I've already begun recommending it to friends. I'm very glad I discovered this book. I'm now reading another Crouch book, \\"Run\\", and it's shaping up to be just as exciting.<br /><br />If you enjoy fast-paced and exciting thrillers, along with some very creepy mystery, then I think you might enjoy \\"Pines\\".

0316023744|4.0|I do not think it wise for those who are World War II buffs to criticize historians for not unveiling some oddly new truth uncovered about the war.  Instead I think it valuable to judge over-all accounts of the war for their veracity and their particular handling of key points in the war.  Some issue must be taken because this overview seems to slight the naval battles fought by the Americans in the Pacific, but I think that the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway get as much treatment as Pearl Harbor, and the Soviet counterattacks around Moscow at the same time.  So I don't think we should be overly critical as American readers.  After all, Mr. Beevor has made it clear that he wrote this book to attempt to synthesize the war for himself, and to discover more about the parts of the war about which he had little understanding.  I think he accomplishes this.  There are innumerable books on Midway and other specific campaigns in the American war in the Pacific to make this an area where you will not be bereft of material, if you don't like Beevor's treatment.<br /><br />What I do like is his detail in relaying the aspect of the Chinese defense against the Japanese.  I have read a few of these overview history, and the campaign in China is always overlooked.  Beevor does a fine job of detailing the savagery of fighting among the Nationalist Chinese, the Maoists, and the Japanese.  The details of Japan's incursions in 1939 against the Soviets and the political/economic war going on inside China and the many issues dealt with there is quite good, and in my mind makes up for the lack of detail supposedly on midway.<br /><br />As an overview, I think it papers over the mistakes of Monty during Market Garden.  But this work otherwise gives a fine account of the war in macro, which as a study is done okay.  If you want to read a more detailed work, get the Weinberg.  If you want more analysis, go with Max Hastings, but if you want a valid and fast-read account of The Second World War, Mr. Beevor provides it.

B007KUFDBY|4.0|I personally am a little bias, I truly enjoyed this movie, based on the Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. A troubled youth acquires in hand a \\"map\\" to the legendary treasure planet a treasure trove, \\"with the loot of a thousand worlds\\".  The adventures involve pirates, space travel, and some extraordinary events which lead to a positive, heart warming outcome.<br /><br />This review is primarily based on the the product itself as a blu-ray/dvd combo.  The digital transfer to blu-ray is astounding.  The colors are clear and crisp and the sound is superb, I watched both the DVD and the Blu-ray.  The difference is amazing.  Originally Treasure Planet is hand drawn movie with CGI integration.  The High Definition Quality seems to allow each of the drawing methods to seamlessly integrate.<br /><br />Regretfully, I must give the movie 4 stars.  Not for the movie itself, but for the lack of new or improved extras.  The only unfortunate part of this transfer to Blu-ray is that the extras are mostly from the original Treasure Planet DVD release, in standard definition.  In most cases it isn't really a big deal, but at the price point of $20 (from August 2012) it made the purchase a little less desirable.<br /><br />However, for the those who simply think this movie is amazing, check out the High Definition Blu-ray and you will be satisfied with your purchase and it is definitely worth is.

0307456323|3.0|As a woman, I almost feel I have to love this book. And I want to, I really do, but I would be lying to myself if I said so. While I thought it was an entertaining book, the characters and such, there was nothing else there for me. Capote clearly knows what he's doing when he writes, but the story itself just didn't capture me as much as I would like. Perhaps the hype was too much over the years. Or perhaps there have been many women based on her that she no longer seemed all that unusual to me anymore. I'm not sure. But I am sure of, is that it wasn't amazing. Good. Not great.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This was a great book!  I was hooked from the first page.  I love it when that happens.  I didn't really know what it was going to be about, but it kept my attention and I thought the writing style was great.  I will definitely look for other books by this author.
B001FA0WI4|5.0|This author is one of the best ever. Covering a period from the Russian revolution to the current state, from monarch oppression, through state capitalism to oligarch power could not be any better than through the eyes of Sashenka and her surroundings.

0307592731|5.0|A couple recommended this book to me when they saw me trying on backpacks at REI.  Admittedly, I'm a strong willed female who does not like to provide fodder for the \\"girls aren't as good as boys\\" club.  I strive to be completely independent and do my adventurous activities with equal precision, skill, and endurance as male counterparts.  Usually I read biographies of females who not only keep up with men, but far exceed the bar with calm-assertive strength (such as climber Lynn Hill).  After a first read through the description of this book I thought, \\"Why would I want to read a story about a woman who attempts a grand adventure totally unprepared and then makes a ton of mistakes?\\". I brushed it off assuming this story just perpetuated the stereotype of women as being emotional and lacking the necessary skills to undertake adventures.<br /><br />I.WAS.WRONG.  For some reason, I could not stop thinking about the book so I just went ahead and got it.  Shortly after receiving it, I couldn't put it down.  This book is about the true inner strength a person has.  Cheryl is brilliant and her story is sad, funny, hopeful and encouraging. I found it comforting to read about how she dealt with the fear that can only come from being a woman who is traveling alone and how she eventually conquered that fear and embraced, even sought out, solitude.<br /><br />Let me caveat this review by mentioning that, and much to the chagrin of reviewers with negative comments, this book is not a \\"how-to\\" PCT trail guide and actually isn't necessarily about backpacking or trails at all. It is about having the wit, guts, and sheer determination to overcome something so overwhelming in your life that it seems impossible. It's about problem solving in the moment, digging deep and finding energy you didn't think you have to keep going forward. Strayed's book is more a how-to guide on being honest with yourself and listening to your inner voice (rather than the voice of reason, in some cases, or nay-saying but well-meaning friends and family).  She reminds us that it's okay to have done things we weren't proud of, it's okay to be a human who does incredibly bone-headed things, and it's okay to take risks and step into the unknown (on a shoe-string budget no less). Rather than lying about her blunders, she gets through them, gets wiser, and lets it all hang out in the process. This book is fascinating, empowering, at times maddening, but over all one hell of an adventure in life!nay-saying but well-meaning friends and family).

B007L6VQHW|4.0|Australian director John Hillcoat brings many of his countrymen with him to film this fact based novel (\\"The Wettest County in the World\\") by Matt Bondurant.  Bondurant's grandfather Jack played here by Shia LaBeouf is the hothead youngest brother of a clan of Prohibition era bootleggers in Virginia.  They make a decent living until a crooked politician vows to eliminate all the small sellers.  He brings in a law enforcement officer from Chicago named Charley Rakes (Guy Pearce).<br /><br />Rakes is no ordinary federal cop.  A popinjay smelling of perfume with slicked back hair and lavender gloves he stands out like a T-Rex in the hills of southeastern Virginia.  His appearance contradicts his viciousness as the legal hired gun.  While all the local citizenry fall in line, the Bondurants are the exception.  Oldest brother Forrest (Tom Hardy) and Howard (Jason Clarke) are hulking men who essentially want to be left alone.  Alas, they won't be.<br /><br />As he did in \\"The Proposition\\" (2005) and 2009's \\"The Road,\\" Hillcoat doesn't shy away from violence, and aside from a couple instances, it comes with viciousness and realism.  The film does slip occasionally, usually when Jack does something really stupid knowing of their situation.  Even with his youth, his foolishness seemed calculated to get LaBeouf and Mia Wasikowska, as Jack's girlfriend, more screen time.  On the whole the film gives an entertaining vision of gnarly Prohibition era Americana.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game.  it makes me imagine what life was like in the early days.  my son likes it,  too. Enjoy!
030758836X|4.0|Its a novel written by an intelligent person. That in itself is worth a read but what makes this novel a good one is the complexity of the characters. You could look at this as a crime novel or a thriller but I look at it as a romance. What happens when two people fall in love? What happens when those people are so freaking twisted? What happens when sometimes love is all you have got to fall back on? I liked the psychology and the concepts in this novel. It is a little bit wordy though. But the words contribute to understanding the characters a lot better and validating their decisions rather well. Read it, you will not be disappointed!

B009329Y30|3.0|Briefly, what I like about this movie, well the story was appealing, sweet and warm. Finally I get to see Zach Effron in a role that requires something more than just looking pretty, that he indeed do in this movie, but in a warm way. The little boy acting was really good as well.<br />My con's, well I did not see any real chemistry between the two characters, it was rather force and the women performance did not impress me. It wasn't the same chemistry I saw in the Notebook for example, Goslin and Rachel were rather intense and believable, specially after the heavy rain in the boat, kind of a coincidence that it have a similar \\"getting wet\\" way in this movie as well. Zach is believable in his role and loveable, but I don't know, I didn't see any spark. And in the other hand, I did not like the kid father fate at the end, it should have develop into something more meaningful. Also I felt it to long, I have to fast forward a little bit after an hour in it. And yes I agree with previous review, he is just the perfect man, but well maybe he is just that a good old boy that have seen to much to soon.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|This CD was in my car cd player for about six months and then was replaced by the live version, equally as good if not better because, as someone else has noted, of the crowd interaction. I am really afraid of wearing them out..Many times I have been rocking away and looked over to see someone in a passing car staring at me as if i was nuts.. I do love Arcade Fire and The Suburbs in particular, but M. & Sons was robbed of the Grammy for Sigh No More. No, really they were.. Awaiting Babel with deep anticipation. They came to my fair city and played a small theatre in early (5/25) 2010 and tickets were relatively easy to obtain because no one knew who they were..Not any more. Now? Forget it..which is actually okay, because I can put the live CD on and crank it up and the amount of energy it gives my tired old bones is enough to get me through..between these guys,Neko Case, Gillian W.,  The Pines, The Avett Bros. and Trampled By Turtles(and many others) it is obvious there is hope for independent music and traditional music and Americana in particular. Not everyone and not everything musically has to revolve around American HasBeen..er..Idol. The truly talented artists find a way..

B000KRNCYY|5.0|This is my favorite of all the CW albums: it's the most Celtic to me.<br />The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun begins with a sense of ancience; it's like you're standing on a cliff overlooking the sea and the voices come from the distant shore. It's about the day's awakening: a magical, triumphant song.<br />The Prayer isn't one of my favorites: Chloe's voice is beautiful, I just don't particularly like the song.<br />Newgrange is sung by Orla (my favorite-sniff-I wish she were still with CW). Her voice perfectly suits the mystical, magical words about rings and tombs and druids.<br />Over the Rainbow is a whimsical rendition of the classic. I always feel like I'm floating on a cloud when I listen to it.<br />Granuaile's Dance is Mairead's only solo on the CD (she should have another solo, everyone else gets two, except Lisa who gets three). It starts out with mystery, then Mairead whirls the music half in flames and half in lively dance music. I don't know how she does it!<br />The Blessing, sung by Lisa, is kind of the low spot on the CD: to me it's kind of sappy.<br />Dulaman is Meav's only solo (the other is shared with Hayley). It's a song about romance and seaweed (don't ask). It's all in Gaelic and a very exciting song. Meav just rolls those hard Gaelic words without faltering. She has a very thrilling voice.<br />Beyond the Sea is a beautiful song about love and hope. It really feels like you're sailing.<br />Hayley and Meav sing the Last Rose of Summer, a very lovely song with a pristine harp and orchestra accompinament. It's actually a poem, and their voices make it pure art.<br />Caledonia is such a cool song. There's something in Lisa's voice that warms your heart and sends your mind drifting.<br />Lascia Ch'io Pianga Hayley's first solo, is one of the two more Classical pieces on the CD. You'll really appreciate it if you're familiar with Classical music. Mairead adds a little Celtic flair to Handel's delicate melody.<br />Carrickfergus is a bittersweet song sung by Orla. It will bring tears to your eyes. Her harp playing is lovely as well.<br />Vivaldi's Rain, sung beautifully by Chloe, is a melody Vivaldi wrote in the Four Seasons. (I think it's from Spring, but I'm not sure.) Again, you'll probably appreciate it more if you're interested in Classical music.<br />In the Voice, Lisa sings the call of Ireland. It's a very Celtic song: it sounds like it came from thousands of years ago.<br />Scarborough Fair is a traditional English song sung by Hayley. It's a sad song of true love.<br />Mo Ghile Mear is a riveting song. The drummers do a great job. It's in both English and Gaelic, and very magical.<br />A New Journey is well worth your money. Buy it and love it :)

B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked reading this book. It is hard to put down and the writing is very straight forward. There are many twists and turns, it keeps you guessing the whole time. Much of the book is devoted to the relationship of a married couple in their first 5 years together. I felt that the portrayal of their relationship from both sides was heartbreakingly real and never watered down the raw emotions. Others have criticized the ending, but I thought it was appropriate for the story. I would definatly reccomend this book.

B005FISBTO|3.0|. . . if I am going to watch the next season. Get some adults to write the next shows. I was a Dexter fan from the beginning but had a problem when Rita came into the picture. Dexter as a family man? Anyway, I stuck it out and rate the other seasons 4.5 and 5 stars (glad to see her go). However, Season 6 is a contrived mess. When your whole show depends on the title character surviving by being picked up more than 5 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean by a random boat when he is going under and about to drown . . . Really?  Burning gasoline in a nice circle in the middle of the ocean . . . Really? This season is filled with this sort of fantasy writing to advance the plot. Showtime is lucky they haven't been sued by the producers of Fight Club and The Sopranos for stealing their story ideas. On the other hand, Brother Sam was one of the best characters ever to appear in this show. He would have been great to keep around for seasons to come. It was nice to see Dexter talk to a real person instead of the dead people in his mind. Sam would have given this show a much needed genuine character who demonstrated the possibility of redeeming oneself regardless of your past. No, kill him off. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars, about 2.5. Some reviewers gave this 1 star and complained about the beginning promo that spoiled the whole season. Maybe they bought bootlegs. I always skip the ads and did so with these discs by simply pushing the Skip button. I didn't know about the spoiler until I started to write this. One last thing. The carriers for the set I have will not hold the discs in place so they come loose even when you close the case. I had to tape them in place to keep them from sliding around and getting scratched up.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|I got a really good deal on this MP3 album. I had a credit of a few dollars from some promotion Amazon was running, but it had to be used on MP3 albums.<br />I'm really an Apple/iOS person, although I do have a Fire. So my main concern was going out of the Apple Ecosystem. Also, I like a good deal, and Amazon sometimes offers some great deals. This was one of those times. I had no problem integrating my Amazon Music purchases into my iTunes and getting all the Amazon Music I've purchased is now on my iPhone so I can play it anywhere.<br /><br />Amazon has a music player for the iPhone/iPad, but you can also import all the Amazon stuff directly in. With their app you can keep the music in the cloud and just play what you want. But this is LED ZEP! Who wants to hide the team of Plant/Page from being played when I have no signal? The greatest rock band ever! So I chose to import.<br /><br />Now to the album itself. While you may feel some nostalgia at holding a physical album in one's hand, the quality of digital is obviously much better. This album has a ton of hits on it. I would have purchased this album for just a few of the songs on it. Almost every single song on this LP is a hit classic rock song. And, they've all been remastered for quality. So even though I got this album at a good price, it's still a good value even at full price. This album is a must for the collection of anybody who likes or wishes to be exposed to Classic Rock Music.

0545405777|5.0|This is not a cheerful story, with a happy ending.  The Hunger Games is a competition in which winning, means you lose. Politics at play, illusions of the media, and a young girl tries to survive in a fight for her life.  Blood is spilt, friends are lost, and lies are told.  When a government owns it's people.  They are never free.  This book is a very good read, even with the typos.  Forget the hype and just enjoy the book, but like I said.  Don't look for a happy ending.
B005FITIGO|5.0|In truth, haven't paid much attention to films dealing with the fiscal meltdown and various human failures preceding The Great Recession. However, had a free slot open and figured, what the heck? It has Kevin Spacey and Paul Bettany, actors whom I've long respected and liked. How bad could it be?<br /><br />Well, it wasn't. Not by a long shot.<br /><br />Beyond what the average person learns from the few unbiased journalists and angry duped investors, don't know too much about toxic mortgage products, derivatives, credit default swapping and the various gamblers who infest the industry to ply and play their games. But this stunning film cuts to heart of the issue - regardless of whether or not you're an addict in denial.<br /><br />Opens with an entry level analyst who picks up an incendiary project from his recently fired boss; tossed away in a typical \\"reorganization\\" that essentially eviscerated various divisions within a financial services company. Intuitively following up on the cryptic last comment made by his former superior, what he helps uncover is the tip of a terrifying iceberg - one that would eventually become a tipping point to global catastrophe.<br /><br />Forget the big names. We're talking families in homes that they should not have been able to afford, now on the streets. Millions of jobs lost that are never coming back. Frighteningly close to a breakdown of social order. The lives of average citizens upended and gutted. People who had absolutely nothing to do with what those soulless whores did to make an easy buck is revealed in this disturbing production.<br /><br />This struck a chord, reminding me of another film. An evil form of mathematics that worked out the cost-benefit ratio in its purest essence. In 2001 HBO released, \\"[[ASIN:B00005YUO1 Conspiracy]]\\", detailing the 1941 meeting of Nazi hierarchy that laid out the foundation for The Final Solution. No morality, no ethics, no compassion, no humanity. Whatever worked out best for those sitting at the table - that's the plan. Simple as that. And the fictitious firm in 'Margin Call' is undoubtedly very much true-to-life of most, if not all, these types of businesses. Wannsee exponentially cubed.<br /><br />Thought it was fascinating that none, not even the senior analyst played by Spacey, heartbroken over the death of his beloved dog, are anything near sympathetic. You don't feel compassion for these people because they're not worthy of such generosity. These are self-serving manipulators who are out to get theirs - period. Any concept of \\"honor\\" or \\"community\\" does not exist for these muckers. In my opinion, for the most part, they're functioning sociopaths. One moment crying for a dying pet, the next, happily celebrating the symbolic deaths of their ill-fated colleagues, encouraging others to feel the same by specifically instructing them to totally and completely forget their existence. Wow.<br /><br />My understanding, confirmed by various dictionaries and medical profiles I perused, is that these people exhibit the very definition of sociopathy. If not naturally, then as part of an accepted set of rather appalling behaviors.<br /><br />Appreciated that the filmmakers gave us the choice of humanizing them or not.<br /><br />Not.<br /><br />Simultaneously revealing that the general populace is indeed as gullible as implied throughout the script. I looked up the dates that Jeremy Iron's character mentions in the film - 1637, 1797, 1819, 1827, 1857, 1884, 1901, 1907, 1929, 1937, 1974, 1987, 1992, 2000, etc. I was stunned. He's right. The gamblers can't help themselves. Especially when they're in positions of power such as government. There's no such thing as oversight, because our leaders are heavily invested in and paid recipients of the game. Terrifying.<br /><br />Personal Notes:<br /><br />- Paul Bettany's car speech is, despite the context, a bravura performance. Taking J.C. Chantos' words and imbuing them with a depth and quality sincerely equalto any Shakespearean soliloquy.<br /><br />Seth: \\"Bleep, this is really going to affect people. Real people.\\"<br /><br />Will: \\"Seth, listen, if you really want to do this with your life you have to believe you're necessary - and you are. People want to live like this - in their cars, in their big bleeping houses they can't even pay for - then you're necessary. The only reason they all get to continue living like kings is 'cause we've got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off, well then the whole world gets really bleeping fair, really bleeping quickly. And nobody actually wants that. They say they do, but they don't. They want what we have to give them, but they also want, you know, to play innocent and pretend to have no idea where it came from. And that's more hypocrisy than I'm willing to swallow. So bleep them. Bleep normal people.\\"<br /><br />Yep. And the scary part is that - he's not wrong. Bookies can't feel sorry for the avarice driven dupes that utilize their services. No one is holding a gun to anyone's head to play the market.<br /><br />- It's embarrassingly enjoyable, but when things turn truly desperate, I enjoyed watching the sharks devouring the other sharks. Those who thought to keep themselves 'safe', ultimately left without a chair when the music stopped. Small repayment, a tiny fractional bit of karmic justice, as several characters - including one of the architects of the twisted packaged mortgages plan - is told she will be the fatted calf, the sacrifice.

0307592731|3.0|I found this book a little disappointing, perhaps because I'd had such high hopes.<br /><br />Strayed's voice of authority about her trail experiences is unquestionable to me.  I've also spend weeks in the wilderness, carrying everything required to survive on my back, facing snakes, bears, mountain lions, lightening storms, and grueling ascents.  Her narratives of being shattered and healed by the trail, being humbled and knit back together, rings true.  The spirituality, the trail magic, the danger, the fear, the blessings, these are all there.<br /><br />However, the focus of the narrative wandered too much for me, and reminded me, unfavorably, of Eat, Pray, Love.<br /><br />Strayed goes to the wilderness, sensibly, to recover from mother grief, drug abuse, and sexual irrationalities.  Then spends time on the trail smoking weed, drinking, worrying about condoms, and talking about black bras and panties.  Really?  That's not all she spends time doing. And I know the rest of your life doesn't evaporate the minute your feet hit the trail.  But I could've done with fewer graphic descriptions of sex on the beach with a stranger, and details of using her stove bag as a purse at a nightclub. Yes, there is a nightclub outing in the middle of the trail journey. This is what I mean.<br /><br />Life is not clean and simple. All things said, she did an admirable job shaping and forming a mess of disparate, contradictory facts into a coherent, directed whole. The overarching theme of her mother grief manages to somehow, barely, encompass everything under it's capacious arc.  I just wasn't planning on rereading Eat, Pray, Love.  And by the time I was done, that what I felt I'd accomplished.<br /><br />Finally, for anyone even thinking about hitting the trail with a pack, this book is an excellent example of the wrong way to do almost everything.  From her overloaded pack to her ruined feet, I winced and groaned with first-hand understanding of the pain and horrors she was bringing on herself.  Somehow, she made it to the end. Valiantly.  And makes many of the worst passages of physical ordeal somehow funny. Which shows tremendous courage and the ability to reframe her experiences.  But when you're dangerously dehydrated, drinking filthy pond water in 100+ degree heat, because you're too proud, trail-ignorant or cheap to buy the water or water carrying device you know you should, it's not funny.  It's just stupid and frightening.<br /><br />When you're pulling off your blackened toenails, bandaging deep and bleeding blisters on top of blisters, and rubbing the skin on your back and hips into raw callouses, it becomes a real medical issue, and not just a matter of trail gumption.  Her pack needed adjusting to her frame, she needed new boots long before she got them, and I'd be surprised if her feet are not semi-permanently damaged to this day by the insanity she willingly put them through. You do not have to hike the PCT or anywhere else like this. You simply do not. She survived her grief, the wilderness, and against all odds, her own astounding pride and stupidity again and again. But no one should take this book as trail advice. I know it's not intended that way. It's a memoir of grief and overcoming. But there will be a few people who don't know that.
B005LAII3A|2.0|Was really looking forward to this flick, explaining why I'm so disappointed. Had placed too much hope in the film, the letdown ended up far greater had I just gone in without any expectations.<br /><br />What truly bothered me was this wasn't a reboot or fresh interpretation of [[ASIN:0806512091 the source Philip K. Dick short story]]. Ultimately, it was a straight forward duped copy of the [[ASIN:B00070FX5U 1990 movie]]. For a solid sixty-to-seventy percent of the flick, it was a virtual scene-by-scene total rip of the original. They didn't even change the script. Oh, they altered the 'Free Mars' aspect and turned it inward, sure. And the dense CGI cityscapes were very impressive. But making a xerox copy isn't creating art or even entertainment. (Before anyone says it, which would you rather have - the copy or the real thing? I know which I'd choose)<br /><br />More so given that I thought Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel skillfully executed their roles, providing excellent performances to the production. And, as it happens, I like both actors. But even their energetic and sincere efforts couldn't, and wouldn't, salvage this inferior imitation. There just wasn't enough meat on the bone; not enough for the audience to feel empathy toward or engage as their characters. And most disappointingly, the one aspect I expected to play a huge aspect in the film - Rekall's false memories - didn't play a significant part in the plot at all. Wow.<br /><br />Sadly, this production is utterly soulless, lacking even the dark comedic touches of the original. I don't think I laughed once during the entire film. Where was the brassy repartee? The twisted joys of Venusville? The snarky one-liners? If they were going to do a rip-off, why neuter the better parts?<br /><br />It seemed everyone took themselves, especially the director, so seriously.<br /><br />Reboots are best when filmmakers are inspired by the original, revitalizing the old school with a new school vibe. Giving a fresh coat and a new addition to a well-loved home. Same thing with cover songs. If you're going to do a version - make it *your* version - not do a singalong with a karaoke machine.<br /><br />Director Len Wiseman didn't create anything - all he did was consume the original and regurgitate.

B008QE9XD2|2.0|***Spoiler Warning***<br /><br />Dreadful. Now that's a word I don't hear or use very often. But dang, it's the most appropriate term for this silly train wreck of a flick.<br /><br />Admittedly, I'm not a fan of auteur director Tim Burton. But this, this would be bad regardless of whatever name was attached to it. Had he adopted a pseudonym like say, John Smith, I would be here saying that Director Smith had pooped out a turd and called it a movie.<br /><br />Not sure if Hollywood has yet figured out that Burton's visionary talent is monochromatic astigmatism with a dash of delusional creativity. Like a street performer - while initially fascinating and providing a momentary diversion, quickly loses steam as one gets bored by the repetitive drone. You've seen it all before. The man is the definition of a one-string banjo with a bucket of white face paint and mobile airbrush on the side.<br /><br />Depp's vampire-outside-his-own-time bit quickly grows tiresome and honestly doesn't make the best use of the material. There were a multitude of lost opportunities as Burton went for the cheap easy laughs, failing to exploit anachronisms to their maximum potential. Sadly, there were only a few moments of pure cleverness. One of the best as Barnabus makes a quiet sideways inquiry on meeting the young Collins daughter Carolyn for the first time, to which she replies in a wonderful deadpan, \\"I think he called me a hooker.\\" Unfortunate that there weren't more of those.<br /><br />The one performance I found enjoyable - Eva Green. To me, she struck the right balance of zesty campiness, sincere wickedness and forlorn love warped into vicious jealousy. Previously she's always taken the quiet, often low-key approach to her characterizations. But as witch Angelique, the funny comedienne emerged from her more established cool sensual persona. Fun and tasty, I like to think this role will broaden her appeal to differing filmmakers.<br /><br />The worst aspect of this production was that the entire film lacked cohesiveness. Various components patched together with no sense of a greater theme; scenes and cast that were disconnected and unfinished.<br /><br />Examples of script incongruity:<br /><br />- Victoria states she was always returning to Collinswood and back to Barnabas. When does she \\"always return\\" to the township? It's never explained. And that when she returns, it's always to him. Wasn't he stuck in a coffin all her life? So... &lt;shrug><br /><br />- Another quagmire: How many ghosts inhabit the manor? Two apparently. There's the original Josette who haunts her modern incarnation Victoria. Then suddenly, and conveniently without any explanation, young David's mother appears in a pathetic deus ex machina cheat to save the day. Confusingly, neither interacts with the other. 'Natch, since we're only introduced to the other spirit toward the very end of the film.<br /><br />- Carolyn's lycanthropy. No seeming point to this other than as a hurried prop thrown into this weak monster bash. All that was missing was ol' Bolt Neck.<br /><br />Stuff like this irks since we're left trying to make sense out of the senseless; pressed to make our own mental jigsaw by forcing the various pieces to fit.<br /><br />Lack of directorial oversight and ignoring simple internal story logic.<br /><br />Mostly, I feel bad for the hardcore Dark Shadows fans. Can't begin to imagine their disappointment, frustration and anger. And in truth, if I were part of any iconic cultural heritage, and the name Tim Burton was suddenly mentioned in conversation, I'd be very, very scared. The man has the unfortunate black thumb of moviemakers looking to plumb the cultural bank. Planet Of The Apes, Mars Attacks, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory - the list of smoking craters and salted fields goes on and on.<br /><br />Honestly, you're better off watching the '[[ASIN:B000FIHN52 The Addams Family]]' reboots or kicking back with '[[ASIN:B0088EDMMS Hocus Pocus]]'.that the entire film lacked cohesiveness.

This is how the story goes: The true story of the infamous Bondurant Brothers: bootlegging siblings who made a run for the American Dream in Prohibition-era Virginia. Inspired by true-life tales of author Matt Bondurant's family in his novel \\"The Wettest County In The World,\\" the loyalty of three brothers is put to the test against the backdrop of the nation's most notorious crime wave.<br /><br />The cast led by Shia LaBeouf (as Jack), Tom Hardy (as Forrest), Gary Oldman (as Floyd Banner), Mia Wasikowska (as Bertha), Jessica Chastain (as Maggie), Jason Clarke (as Howard) & Guy Pearce (as Charlie Rakes) is great. The directing by John Hillcoat is great. The screenplay (based on Matt Bondurant's novel) by Nick Cave (who also did the music) is great.<br /><br />The music by Cave & Warren Ellis is great. The cinematography by Benoit Delhomme is great. The film editing by Dylan Tichenor is great. The casting by Francine Maisler is great. The production design by Chris Kennedy is great. The art direction by Gershon Ginsburg, Sharon Davis (also set design) is great. The set decoration by Maria Nay, set dresses by Julie Hardin, Konrad Lewis, Taraja Ramsess, JoAnna Robinson, Mike Samuels, Kip Bartlett & Nichole Wleklinski is great. The costume design by Margot Wilson is great. The special effects coordinated by David Fletcher is great. The visual effects coordinated by Joey Bonander & Andrew G. Cox, supervised by Dick Edwards, Bill Taylor & Mark Stetson is great. The stunts coordinated by Mickey Giacomazzi & John T. Cypert is great. The special make-up design by David LeRoy Anderson is great.<br /><br />This is a great crime drama that is entertaining and well-made, as well, as well-crafted, too. Shia LaBeouf & Tom Hardy, who is terrific as Forrest, lead a well-acted cast. This is also a gritty and thrilling movie that is well-designed and detailed, visually. John Hillcoat & Nick Cave have done another terrific and entertaining movie together, in the line with their collaborations together, \\"The Road\\" & \\"The Proposition\\". This is one of the best movies of the summer, ironically, ending the summer season, solidly.
0345803485|1.0|Bad writing, bad story. i read on thinking it must surely get better, but it never did. Yes, my 4 year old has a broader vocabulary. How on earth does such writing get published.Thank goodness i did not pay a dime for this book, but did waste my time, which is worth more than money. Wont be reading 2 and 3 for sure.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent book!  You will not want to put it down!  Sylvia day does agreat job!  Can't wait for the next one to come out!

B00846TTDG|5.0|We know that the men and women that fight for us are in harm's way but this movie shows it in a way that is palpable.  It was really hard for me to watch because I struggle with watching anyone get hurt, but I come away from this amazingly executed film with total awe, respect, and gratitude for the men that have trained and sacrificed for the protection of our nation.<br /><br />I am also angered when I remember how our president took credit for the Seal's team work that took out Bin Laden and then only a month later dismissed our military as non-essential personnel who would not be paid should the debt-ceiling not be raised. ( August 2011)<br /><br />Now, when the Seals are expressing concern about leaks of classified information in order to make Obama look 'good' BO responded by saying that he doesn't take the Navy Seals seriously.<br /><br />Our men and women in our military and our Navy Seals represent the best that this nation has to offer, and they deserve more respect from our president.<br /><br />I am grateful for a movie that depicts in a very realistic way the danger and harm that they face every day.<br /><br />THANK YOU NAVY SEALS AND THANK YOU TO OUR U.S. MILITARY!

034580404X|5.0|This was not just a book about sex, it was a book about the changes in a man who was abused as a child and how he had to learn to love and be loved. Ana was the child like woman that taught him he was worthy of love. One of the best set of books I have read. It is worth the read.

0062197258|3.0|This was a good book but amazon pointed me to it because I bought Gone Girl. Gone Girl was great with amazing twists and murder.<br />Into The Darkest Corner is a novel about stalking, domestic violence and the OCD of the victim.  A good book but disappointing as I wanted to read a thriller/ mystery.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG, this is an incredible trilogy. A little redundant with the same words over and over but captured me until I read all three books. Can't wait for the movie to come out!
0439023513|2.0|Sadly it appears Collins really does not know how to write sequels.  The first book was great, but it's all downhill from there.<br /><br />The problems are so numerous it's hard to know where to begin.  The biggest is that Katniss never does anything of significance or participates in an operation of military value.  Literally her only job is looking good in front of cameras.  Whenever they send her anywhere near a combat zone, it always goes something like this:  Katniss does some scene for the cameras, a battle breaks out, she disregards orders and endangers everyone around her, then gets injured and wakes up in a hospital bed.  That's it.  Just the same process over and over.<br /><br />It's not until the last quarter of the book when she partakes in an actual operation, and even then it's against orders and ultimately pointless.  Really I was wondering why they needed her at all.<br /><br />That brings up another issue.  The capitol falls way too easily.  Roughly halfway through the book, it's clear that the defeat of the capitol is already a forgone conclusion.  This was the same capitol that kept district 13 in check and a stranglehold over the twelve others for the last 75 years?  Unbelievable!  There is no way they should go down so easily.  They really felt like the underdogs and I often found myself rooting for them.<br /><br />Not only that, but the major thing that prevented the capitol and 13 from fighting in the past, the fact that both sides have nuclear weapons, is completely disregarded for no reason.  Both sides attack each other without worrying about this at all, and without considering using them.  It just makes no sense.<br /><br />And where on earth is the character development?  Katniss is still the scared little teen she was in the first book, always doubting her own abilities and expecting to die at every moment.  She's still only good at hunting and archery.  Nothing else.  She's still way too overly emotional and more then once suffers amental breakdown, resulting in her being sedated.  This made sense before she went through the Hunger Games, but not anymore.  She should be a hardened, disciplined warrior who understands the realities of the world.<br /><br />Finally, the writing is downright lazy in a lot of areas.  Collins clearly isn't good at writing military matters.  For example, whenever talking firearms, she always uses the term \\"gun\\" and nothing else.  No descriptions.  Katniss' bow is described in major detail, why not give the same treatment when she finally learns to use modern weaponry?  What kind of gun is it?  Pistol, rifle, submachine gun, futuristic death ray?  We should know these things.<br /><br />Despite some good action scenes later on and some excellent portrayals of the brutality of war, Mockingjay simple does not work in the end.
0307592731|1.0|Do not spend your money on this book.  It was terrible.  Cheryl has no sense of reality either at the beginning of her journey or the end.  She, time and again, acts in selfish and self-centered ways and seems to have learned nothing from her long walk.  Cheryl says many times throughout this book that she is an idiot and I couldn't agree more.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I am addicted to this game. It is challenging without being frustrating and a lot of fun. I like how you can work on it little by little at your own pace and not worry about losing your place. I downloaded when it was the free Amazon app of the day. The developer has diligently updates the app with fixes, new puzzles and features. After the first few updates I had some trouble with it crashing and exiting the app with no reason. I kept having to delete the app data and cache to play it. Since then the developer has fixed the issue, added features and added many more puzzles across all the difficulty levels. The best recent feature not only allows you to save your progress to your device but sync it to your other devices. The app works flawlessly now and runs great on both my Asus tf101 tablet and my Samsung galaxy s2. The download definitely deserves 5 stars and I think I will be purchasing the CrossMe Color, too.

B0014BY72Q|1.0|We watched this movie based on the positive reviews and couldn't believe we wasted our time watching the first hour.  After that, we fast forwarded to see if it got any better.  It didn't.  It should have been rated an R for the female upper body nudity and even without that problem, the movie was a typical 70's psychodelic-music, holographic-artistic, drug-induced? film (in my opinion).  I don't EVER want to see it (or recommend it to anyone) again!
B000TEUSJK|5.0|Any True Cinephile takes a certain pride of ownership with this film.<br />Mirren, O'Toole, McDowell in unexpected display of the Emperor's Sexual Puppet Plays.<br />If you have enjoyed Rome, Sparticus, Blood & Sand and the many others in a historical, cinematic perspective, you simply cannot miss this film!<br />Bold, graphic & bawdy, \\"Caligula\\" takes the cake and is THE cherry on top!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is hours of entertainment. In the 9x9 grids my pipes started to pixelated - but it could just be my phone (I downloaded a crap crappy theme).
B0058YPILY|5.0|I have watched Criminal Minds since it 1st aired in Sept. of 2005. I have also purchased every season DVD boxset, as well. It has become 1 of my all-time favorite shows-a show that I can watch episodes of multiple times & enjoy them as much as, if not more each time. When Season 6 aired, I wasn't all that impressed. When it came out on disc, I hoped that I would enjoy them on their 2nd viewing a bit more. Again, I was a bit dissapointed in that season.<br />However, Season 7 was amazing-the show went back to being the intense, original, well-written, plot-driven program that I had loved since the start. Some of the stand -out episodes for me are \\"True Genius\\", \\"There's No Place Like Home\\", \\"Profiling 101\\", \\"Snake Eyes\\", \\"Proof\\", & \\"Hit/Run\\". I will miss Emily Prentiss, as she has been my favorite character on the show since she started in Season 2! When pre=ordering this, I made sure that it would be delivered on the Tuesday of release (Sept. 4th). I cannot wait to relive what is, in my humble opinion, 1 of the show's most original, disturbing, & entertaining seasons. 23 engrossing episodes await me on 6 discs come Tuesday!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Its just a copy of one of Stephen King's books so prety much this is a very bad book dont read it
030758836X|5.0|There's a missing person at the centre of Gillian Flynn's elaborate and impressively plotted thriller, but in addition to the conventional genre meaning, there's a fascinating study underlying the case with another type of missing person - the loss of personality that comes - inevitably it seems - with the compromise of marriage.  It's marriage that you come to realise is the 'killer' here in Gone Girl, but it's written in such a manner by the author under the guise of a twisting densely plotted thriller, that it completely takes you off your guard.<br /><br />And taking you off your guard is clearly the intention in the two person perspective that shows two very different views on the marriage of Nick and Amy, both before and after Amy goes missing.  On the one hand you have Nick dealing with the disappearance of his wife, and not dealing with it as well as he should be with the media looking on and regarding him as the obvious suspect.  Then you have Amy's perspective in alternate chapters, taken from excerpts of her diary in the period leading up to her disappearance, detailing the events that take the couple from a seemingly idyllic encounter and romance in New York, through to the harder times that they are currently going through five years later, having both lost their jobs and moved down to Missouri to look after Nick's ailing, aging parents.<br /><br />The two differing perspectives paint a picture of the harsh realities of a relationship that has lost its sparkle and seems to have turned into something rather ugly, but there's definitely something 'off' about both accounts.  Amy's view - perhaps on account of her upbringing, the model for her parents' successful range of Amazing Amy children's books - seems too idealistic, too passive about the failings that have led them to this position, while Nick seems to be taking the disappearance of his wife much too casually and lying an awful lot for a person who claims he has nothing to hide.  Evidently, neitheraccount can be completely trusted, but then isn't that always going to be the case when it comes to apportioning blame for the failings of a marriage?<br /><br />Well yes, but obviously the difference here is that this one has ended in what looks like a murder, and the author uses both those varying accounts to sway the reader's divided loyalties one way or another in where their sympathies and suspicions lie.  It's masterful writing, textbook stuff, but Flynn's writing in Gone Girl goes way beyond that, exploiting the whole situation not only to work with the dynamic of the give-and-take, push-and-pull of a marriage dispute, but by expanding it out into the unseemly media circus that erupts around the case, she manages to say a lot about the failings of the individuals as well as the expectations placed on them by society.  The book makes some brilliant observations on both levels, yet somehow still manages to be a taut, credible, jaw-dropping thriller.  It's a little over-elaborate in terms of plotting, but this is one author who is capable of pulling off the near impossible.  I don't think it's perfect, but this is an impressive and intelligent novel that will resonate with a lot of people, daringly pushing emotional buttons, having something meaningful to say about relationships that you might feel uncomfortable about, while at the same time being a hugely entertaining thriller that keeps you guessing about how it can possibly be resolved.  Flynn pulls it off, and does so impressively.
B000T1D9KS|5.0|A great cd. If you love Corrine you'll love this cd. Makes me just want to start a bath and relax. You will too.
B008EKMGUU|5.0|It's always good to have a fresh outlook placed on the subjects of Handel's Baroque operas - or at least I think so anyway.  Whether it's traditional (although I've never seen a Handel opera done \\"authentically\\" period), whether it's in a modern setting, or according to a more abstract conception, it helps if there is a strong vision that is able to reconsider what the essential themes of the work are and how they can be best presented to a modern audience.  The purpose of any production, modern dress or otherwise, must surely be to reflect on what the work is actually about, not recreate a historical performance, and if it can break through the rigid formalism of opera seria and actually make it entertaining at the same time, well then so much the better.<br /><br />Recognising that Handel's first London opera from 1711 is not the most consistent work, the majority of it cobbled together like a remix of Handel's earlier greatest hits, it certainly does no harm to try and make it look as fresh and meaningful as Handel somehow manages to make it all sound.  Robert Carsen makes his intentions clear from the outset, asking the question \\"Were the Crusades political or inspired by an act of personal vengeance?\\"  This message is written in chalk across a blackboard and it's an English boys' boarding school that acts as the backdrop or framing device to delve into the personal sentiments expressed so beautifully if somewhat generically in what is after all a patched together piece.  In response to this history lesson question, a young boy, bullied and teased by his classmates, his life made a misery by his authoritarian teachers, imagines himself the great warrior Rinaldo and sees the mighty forces of Goffredo coming out from behind the blackboard to slay his tormentors.<br /><br />Setting a Crusades war within the confines of a boarding school, the action taking place in classrooms, bike-sheds, dorms and locker rooms, with a gym turned into a torture chamber (there's a difference?) and an epic battle taking place on a football pitch, the production could however just as easily be seen as itself placing a distance between the actual events described and sung about in the libretto, but Carsen manages nonetheless to faithfully retain the entire sense of the original work within this setting.  In the mind of a schoolboy, this story is wrapped up in teasing by his classmates over his girlfriend, and the dark figures of authority that keep them apart are those of the school teachers.  Mix in some Furies with a St Trinian's thing going on and sadistic teachers in rubber bondage outfits and it certainly adds another dimension to the passions and characterisation of these mythological figures.  There are lots of clever little details in the props, uniforms and locations of the school that fit very well with the Crusade theme, but these, quite correctly, remain secondary to the love story whose purity is reflected perfectly in the innocence of first-love in the playground and by the bike-sheds.<br /><br />Many of the directorial choices provoke laughs from the audience at Glyndebourne, which you might not consider appropriate for an opera seria, but it shows that there is genuine engagement with the work.  Whether it also inspires the performers I couldn't say, but musically and in terms of the singing, this is a magnificent production, so at least it clearly isn't a distraction.  All the main roles are sung terrifically well.  Tim Mead is one of the best Handel countertenors, but I've never heard him singing so well as Eustazio, his voice as angelically pure as a schoolboy soprano, so perhaps the production does indeed help in that respect.  The purity and idealism of young love and innocent idealism also works in favour of contralto Sonia Prina's Rinaldo and Anett Fritsch's Almirena - both combining expressiveness with a gorgeous clarity and tone; and if being a sadistic headmaster and a kinky dominatrix school teacher gives force to the commanding performances of Luca Pisaroni and Brenda Rae as Argante and Armida - both of them demonstrating masterful coloratura - then I've no problem with that either.  Varduhi Abrahamyan's Goffredo sounds strong enough at the start, but she isn't able to sustain this through to the final act.<br /><br />The whole thing however is held together and driven along musically by the outstanding performance of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under Ottavio Dantone and anchored by his scintillating harpsichord playing, and it's given additional emphasis in the clarity of the audio tracks on this DVD/BD release.  I don't think I praise the actual quality of the sound reproduction on Blu-ray releases quite enough, but when you hear the tone of the Baroque period instruments in orchestral playing like this and exceptionally good singing, it just sounds incredible.  This is a very fine recording.  Image quality too is near flawless, the production covered well in the editing with no distractions.  The Opus Arte release also contains a few excellent short features on the production and the musical interpretation in the extra features interviews (it's good to hear the musicians views for a change), and there's a booklet with an essay on the work and a full synopsis.  The BD is all-region, 1080i Full-HD, with PCM stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mixes.  Subtitles are in English, French and German only.

B007I1QUYE|5.0|Wow, the quality of these Blue-ray movies is awesome!  Spiderman 1-I feel introduces us to Spiderman pretty good.  I think the story-line is great, acting is decent to good.  I personally did not care much for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  I feel as if she was a little fake and overly dramatic.  Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) I know a lot of comparisons have been made to Garfield from The Amazing Spiderman, but for this series, Maguire was great.  I am not much of a James Franco fan as he plays Harry Osborn.  One carachter that I loved was William Dafoe playing the Green Goblin.  I like most of Dafoes movies though.  Spiderman 2-I personally liked more than Spiderman 1, I particularly enjoyed Doc Ock (Alfred Molina).  I loved this movie, the drama of Parker having to be Spiderman, and the train scene was the best!  Spiderman 3 was worth watching, but that is it.  The CGI was still amazing, but the story line was horible!  They were in a rush to end this trilogy and felt the only way was to introduce a bunch of villians at once.  Sandman would have made a good villian for a movie, Venom should have had his own movie!  I think the fightes were to short in duration as well.  Very disapointed with this movie altogether, but so were millions of other people!  Overall I bought the trillogy for $20 with free shipping.  My overall rating is for all three movies combined Picture quality- 5/5, sound quality 3/5 (this is mostly due to my TV's limitation, a sound system is in the works) Story 4/5 (Spiderman 1-5/5, Spiderman 2-5/5, Spiderman 3-2/5).  Overall value-4.5/5, an overall great value.  Spiderman is now Amazing, but we already knew that.  lol

It is important background to understanding colonialism and the unfortunate  trend in \\"humanitarian interventionism\\" that we still see today.

I am anxious to read his other books.

B0090EIILU|1.0|This is the stupidest comedy movie I have ever seen in my life. The director emphasized on sexual content to make it funny, but it was not funny at all. It's filled with hatred and racism and does not contribute to the multi-culture society that we live in. In fact, it encourages racism against minorities in the American society. I thought Borat was a hateful movie, yet this one has over passed it.
B00004XPPE|5.0|1964's \\"Fail-Safe\\" has spent decades in the shade of its still popular nuclear-age contemporary, \\"Dr. Strangelove\\", whose over-the-top dark humor has proved more agreeable to audiences.  \\"Fail-Safe\\" probably deserves more credit than it has gotten; its minimalist cinematic approach, like \\"Twelve Angry Men\\", depends on some very solid acting and a twist ending to create a realistically tense movie.<br /><br />The premise of \\"Fail-Safe\\" is a cascading series of errors on both sides of the Iron Curtain that set up the United States and the Soviet Union for a potential nuclear holocaust.  The action is seen entirely from the US side, as a double handful of fine actors portray the US officials who must deal with the crisis.  Henry Fonda convincingly plays a US President trying to stave off a full-scale nuclear exchange over the hot line with Moscow, with the help of a young Larry Hagman as his interpreter.  Walter Matthieu has a rare dramatic role as a presidential advisor, while fine Irish actor Dan O'Herlihy has a key role as an US Air Force General.  As the US and Soviet Union relentlessly move toward war, the US President face a chilling course of action, one that he may or may not be allowed to carry out.<br /><br />This particular theme, in which mistakes lead to a nuclear confrontation, has been done several times in the movies and on television, for both dramatic and comedic effect.  Few have an ending as effective as \\"Fail-Safe\\", which is highly recommended to Cold War movie fans.

B008NB0SQO|4.0|Disney needs to step up their game. The past couple of Blu Ray releases have sucked majorly. The discs i have always expected from them to be nice looking, have some artwork on it or look like it had a little time on it. NO! The past few releases only had a plain boring ugly blue disc. NO artwork, no fancy blu ray looking stuff, just plain blue. It looked like a disc you would buy in the $8 bin at walmart. When i buy movies, it is not just for the movie (but mostly is) I buy it because of the collection value, the artwork on the case, the artwork on the disc and of course the special features. I love the work they have on their restoration of their movies, but please, dont be cheap on making things look good all the way in. OH and how DARE you for putting Pocahontas DVDs on one side on top of each other like that. That is so cheap Disney!
030758836X|5.0|There is no need to outline the plot of GONE GIRL, so many other reviewers have already done so, and there's a good synopsis on the product page.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has done a magnificent job of crafting a fine story filled with chameleon-like characters who live different definitions of truth and happiness. In the process she jerks the reader back and forth between sympathizing with and despising some of her characters, and each jerk is a satisfying jolt. GONE GIRL slyly comments on marriage, society, and the ways people manipulate or reconcile themselves to their situations. It is also an insightful study of how we see ourselves, and how we present ourselves--questioning if any of us are the individuals we think we are, or something that was formulated from pop culture.<br /><br />Despite the analytical aspect, GONE GIRL is thoroughly entertaining. It is so well written it makes many other current novels seem like punishments when we read them (after reading GONE GIRL, I immediately began another novel and found myself hating the author because it was so inferior). The story keeps us guessing--not \\"who done it?\\" but \\"what could possibly be next?\\"--and GONE GIRL is thoroughly engaging

0061733199|5.0|Great book that covers just about any survival situation you could find yourself in. This book is loaded with tips, illustrations, and helpful advice. If you had to buy only one book, this would be it. I also have the 21-76 army field manual, and while it also is a good book, I prefer this book because it seems a little more practical and has better readability in my opinion (font is easier on the eyes, content is better organized, pages are nicer). That and it is more comprehensive in the sense that it gives you advice for surviving in a car crash, plane crash, nuclear disaster, and even tips for home survival. In short, it is more up to date, practical, and comprehensive. There are plenty of black-and-white illustrations and this book features a no-fluff writing style. A GREAT VALUE!
B00513DGIO|5.0|I was visiting Munich and was able to access an interview with him on the BBC and found given what we are all concerned about right now he gave a very helpful view of what is happening.

0671449028|5.0|My daughter, who is 10 now, has always LOVED Sandra Boynton books....all of her books that I have bought her but THIS one has always been her favorite one. We read this book sooooo often that I had it memorized by the time I had to leave to deploy to Afghanistan. Every time I was able to call home I would recite this to her from memory; reading her a bedtime story over the phone. That was years ago and we still have Sandra's books that hold so many precious memories of reading together when she was small...even from across the world when we couldn't be together. And now, we are expecting another little girl, Avery, and her big sister will begin the tradition of introducing her little sister to Sandra's magical creations. I will always be grateful for these precious books she wrote. Thank you!
B0000524CY|5.0|Although \\"The Exorcist\\" came out in 1973 and although in the years since then I have seen many many horror films \\"The Exorcist\\" still remains to this day I feel the scariest movie of all times. The story line is very powerful with scenes and imagery that remains with the viewer long after the film has ended. The movie was certainly intended to shock and awe the audience. Coming out of the theater after watching the movie I can remember hardly anyone was talking or laughing or commenting on what they just saw. Everyone was pretty much in silence while exiting the place as if the movie stunned them into that silence. That is how powerful an effect \\"The Exorcist\\" had on the movie viewers. Because of its powerful theme \\"The Exorcist\\" has become such a film legend that pretty much anyone who has never seen the movie or was even born when the movie came out are still familier with the plot and some of the more memorable scenes. Everyone remembers it is \\"The Exorcist\\" with the pea soup scene or how the little girl Regan turns her head all the way around. For those who did see the movie it could cause them to start thinking about the possibilities of an afterlife and the existence of God and Satan. For those who never had any doubt of the existence of God and Satan it just strengthened their beliefs. Even for those who didn't believe in an afterlife or of a force of ultimate good vs a force of ultimate evil still caused them to stop and reflect on the possibilities.<br /><br />For all of the shock and awe not to mention horror \\"The Exorcist\\" has it is still in the end a movie. And a damn good one at that! Good verses evil has from the beginning of movie making been one of the most common themes pitting both sides to the ultimate battle. Good guys verses bad, cowboys verses Indians or Luke verses Darth, regardless of the genre of the film it still comes down to the basic good against bad. Watch this movie just once and it will stay with you forever that is how powerful the movie is. But the fact is it is such a well made film I find I never tire of watching it and have seen it numerious times over the years. It doesn't matter I no longer jump at all gory scenes anymore the power of the movie is still captivating for me. Beautifully directed by William Friedkin to wring out every drop of tension and wonderfully acted with a cast including Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Lee J Cobb and Max Von Sydow in the title roll. The film quality is well beyond first rate led by the editing and special effects which help all the more to create the tension and suspense.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the horror genre and don't have this movie in your collection then what are you waiting for? No horror movie collection is complete without it. If you have never seen this movie then I do recommend this but be prepared. This will be I am sure the most intense movie you will ever see. I recommend this movie regardless of what your religious convictions may be or lack of it. I have read and heard of people who were religious who found their beliefs became even stronger after watching \\"The Exorcist\\". But whether you believe in an afterlife or that we simply turn to dust with our deaths this film will have an effect on you.ovie is.

B005RJ6DUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. They say the majority of people didn't like it but I thought it was wonderful. Chazz Palminteri stars in the film as mentor to Robert De Niro's son, C. I thought Palminteri did a great job in the role of Sonny. I'm used to seeing De Niro in a more mafia in charge role so this was better as he was a father looking after his son. I would highly recommend this film.
B0090SI3CA|4.0|William Friedkin has been around for many, many years but the man still knows how to direct a movie. Now in his mid-70s, his sense for movie-making is as sharp as it was 40 years ago when directing \\"The French Connection\\" and \\"The Exorcist\\" brought his wide acclaim.<br /><br />\\"Killer Joe\\" (105 min.) was originally screened at the 2011 Venice Film Festival but a battle with the MPAA over the film's NC-17 rating held up its US release for almost a year. The distributor LD Entertainment ultimately decided to release the film unchanged and with the NC-17 rating. The plot centers around Chris (played by Emile Hirsch), a small time drug dealer desparately in need of money, and lots of it. With the help and support of several others, including his dad and also his mom's boyfriend, Chris decides to hire a contract killer, Joe, played by Matthew McConaughey, to kill his mom and collect the insurance money. All I will say is that eventually Joe does his part of the deal, but that there are a number of complications. To give away more of the plot would really ruin your viewing experience so you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. This movie is a great example of a \\"film noir\\" and then some, hence I'd call it \\"ultra-noire\\".<br /><br />There is a reason that this movie is rated NC-17, so if you are squirmish about violent scenes, do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. But if you can deal with that, you will be in for one wild and entertaning ride. There are several noteworthy performances. Let's start with Matthew McConaughey, who without a doubt brings a career-defining performance as Killer Joe. It's a shame it comes in a movie not a lot of people are likely to see due to the rating, as for me this is an Oscar-nomination worthy performance. Also bringing an astounding performance is Gina Gershon as Sharla, Chris' stepmother. Towards the end of the movie, when all hell breaks loose, she does one unforgettable scene that will raise the hairs on your neck. And last but not least is June Temple, as Chris' sister Dottie. Temple is rapidly building a name and profile for herself (she recently also was in The Dark Knight Rises and The Three Musketeers). In all, beware of the violence, but this is a very dark, yet entertaining and excellent movie. Miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, \\"Killer Joe\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!neck.

030758836X|1.0|This book started out to be one of the best books I have read in long time. When I was about halfway into the book I told all my friends they have to read it because it is so amazing........then you get to the end. I actually could not believe how it ended. I will definitely tell those that I recommended this book to not waste their time. Such a shame beause I was totally hooked until the last page when it became so ridiculous I thought it was a joke. I stayed up late into the night to see how it ended and now I'm just sad that I missed out on sleep!
B00480OHWK|5.0|Are You My Mother? is the perfect beginner reader.  The story is easy to follow and keeps the child engaged in reading.  The vocabulary is repetitive and yet not boring.  My students, my own children and now my grandchildren have all read and enjoyed this book.  My granddaughter, Jaylyn, is currently rereading this book over and over again. It is a favorite in my house and a gift I give often.  We love this book!!!
B003CYKCHW|4.0|This mouse is especially good for gaming.  This is because of just how LIGHTWEIGHT it feels, and how smoothly it glides across the mousepad.  Great for FPS games.  But, from time to time, after about 3 or so months of usage, it started double clicking on a single click.  This happens only once in a while.  Maybe I'm twitching?  When I focus to click straight down and hard, it doesn't happen.  I don't know - I didn't have this problem before, so it might very well be something wrong with the hardware (I reinstalled Windows and the Drivers plenty - no dice).<br /><br />The build quality is really top notch for being the lightweight product that it's intended to be.  The whole thing is mostly made with soft plastic.  The wires that show not only look cool, but are a result of the company cutting down on materials to make this mouse as lightweight as it is.  The clicking is very, very responsive. You can barely bend any of the plastic the mouse is made out of.<br /><br />My favorite part about this mouse, besides the lightweight feel, is the 4 little indicators and the middle button that allows you to adjust mouse sensitivity on the fly.  Really good for when you don't want to have to go through the Options menu every time you play a game that doesn't feel right.  It's really everything I could ever want in a mouse - smooth movement, lightweight, perfect click response - but there's just one problem.<br /><br />It's not very comfortable.  You have to \\"claw\\" it instead of let your hand rest on it.  I mean, you CAN let it rest on it, but it's not the most comfortable experience when you're just trying to play a casual game or browse the web.  I bought a wristpad/mousepad for the thing and it feels MUCH better now - the part where your palm rests on this mouse is a little too high up.  Then again, maybe it's supposed to be like that.  I feel that I control the mouse much more accurately when I claw it compared to resting my weight on it - again, great for FPS games and split-second timing with this thing, not so much for the more casual user.<br /><br />I'd recommend it.  I'd just look into that whole double clicking on first click thing.<br /><br />- Zak
B007STBUHI|3.0|It's a bit like that old axiom of journalism; \\"Dog bites man, NOT news. Man bites dog, THAT'S news. After all, when a man eats a fish, he's just a Red Lobster customer. But turn it the other way around and, well...<br /><br />Let's face it, this film became a genre in its own right. Anybody who was anybody was required to discuss it in some detail or something had to be wrong with them. It even affect the James Bond series in the person of a scary guy named...uh...\\"Jaws\\". Which kind of explains why there were two sequels, of descennding quality. Spielberg wanted no part of the last one.<br /><br />But in this first offering, you've got Roy Scheider as a burned-out NYPD cop who takes a job as chief of police on a New England coastal resort island. One night a partying teen decides to go swimming and washes ashore mostly munched-on. Shark attack, sez the coroner. BIG shark attack. Chief Brody decides that the beaches should be closed down until further notice, which goes over with the mayor (Murray Hamilton) like a lead balloon. The Holiday weekend is coming up, after all. The mayor decides that Brody is exceeding his authority. Which gives Brody his first experience of how politics can really screw up police work. Probably didn't get much direct experience with that on the precinct level down in the Apple. A modest reward is offered for anybody who can get rid of the shark and a brash sea dog type (Robert Shaw) named Quint insists that he's the only one who can do it--for more than three times the reward offered. So Brody calls in a scientist in the person of the nerdy, intense Cooper (Richard Dreyfus). Meanwhile tourists are rolling in for the holiday weekend in everything from faded Country Squire wagons to Rolls Royces and the body count rises. Some of the attacks are even seen from shore. We learn that just being in shallow water gives no immunity from shark attack. We get a crowd shot including one tourist--a rather obese woman who isn't really shown as being attacked, which might disappoint the modern-day viewer who sneers obsessively over New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's weight as if having major weight issues makes a person subhuman, one of the \\"new nerds\\". So Our Three Heroes cast off in Quint's battered Nova Scotia lobster boat to \\"git that big bad fishie\\". Maybe I'm guilty of a bit of a spoiler here, but this particular shark turns out to be a match for a middlin'-size fishing boat. Nuff said on that.<br /><br />I had forgotten that the score for this film had been done by John Williams--somehow that ominous \\"DUNT-dunt-DUNT-dunt-DUNT-dunt\\" ostinato whenever the shark approaches seems simplistic for the man who scored Star Wars and Harry Potter. But in its own way it has become as signature a piece of movie music as that string section thing that played whenever the Wicked Witch rode her broom in \\"Wizard Of Oz\\", or the twangy guitar thing as James Bond turns towards the camera and fires his Walther in the intro. Cliches, yes--but ones that people often vocally imitate.tacked, which might disappoint the modern-day viewer who sneers obsessively over New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's weight as if having major weight issues makes a person subhuman, one of the \\"new nerds\\".

0307474259|5.0|I bought this book after seeing it mentioned on my favorite blog site Instapundit.com and I'm thankful I did.  I'm a 46 yr old male who has weighed upwards of 290 lbs at times(now 256) and I've had blood pressure issues practically my entire life, even in my teenage years.  I'm not going to go into detail the way other reviewers have because frankly they did a much better job than I could have.  I started the \\"diet\\" Aug 10th,  2012 and today is the first of Sept.  I've lost 20 lbs in 3 weeks and my blood pressure, which I'm taking Atenolol and Lisonopril for was measured at 124/79 last Dr visit 3 days ago.  You might be thinking that the medications are the reason for that but that's not the case.  I measure my bp daily and even with the meds it was always pretty high at times and it ALWAYS skyrocketed when measured at the Dr or during a work physical.  When I was given a pre-hire(pre-diet) physical at my current job I was on the same dosage but the bp was 141/102 after measuring normal that morning.  My cholesterol was measured last year at over 300 and now it's 253,  My Dr. has put me on meds for the cholesterol but he informed me that if I stay the course I should be able to go drug free all around.  I call this my \\"cowboy diet\\" because I eat mostly bacon/sausage and eggs for breakfast, chopping up some green peppers, hot peppers, onions and maybe some mushrooms or garlic to add to the omelet.  I might eat once more in the day and that'll be a lot of chicken, 2 steaks or 3 hamburger patties minus the bun and I try to work in some fish a couple of times a week.  Diet pop, coffee and water are what I drink and that's fine by me.  I also work in a good carb salad daily to top things off.  Another thing I have to mention is that I don't feel hungry 3 hours after eating anymore and I seem to have limitless energy. 1 month ago I could eat 8 slices of extra pepperoni/cheese pizza in one sitting then be back at it 3 hours later finishing off the box and I would feel likea land whale.  This diet might be unsustainable for some people but for me it works and I don't mind cutting out the sugar and flour products one bit.  I see results weekly on the scale and I do recommend you weigh weekly not daily as it may be a little misleading.<br /><br />///Update  Well, it's Feb 2013 my weight is 231(without trying very hard)and I just had a checkup along with bloodwork.  My goal is 215 at 6'1 and good size frame.  My cholesterol ratio is good and all of my numbers have come down along with my BP.  My doctor told me to cut my atenolol tablets in half Yay!  He said he can't take me off it all at once but hopefully the lisinopril/hctz is next along with the atenolol.  My bp was measured at 114/68 at Dr's office.  I've started to recommend this diet to family and friends as it has worked brilliantly for me.  I wanted to use myself as a guinea pig first to make sure there were no negative effects on my health as we have all had it beaten into our brains from grade school on that you must eat what that food pyramid shows us.  BUNK.  If you want to lose weight and can think outside the box, buy this book, make this lifestyle change, and watch the pounds come off.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this \\"diet\\" is that it just doesn't feel like one.  My stomach rarely growls and I don't feel hungry all the time.  To me it's just a change in the way I eat and 95% of the time I adhere to the diet BUT life is short and I do indulge on occasion.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|I love these cross pic puzzles.  I have 3 of the FlipPix aps.  I have worked each of the puzzles multiple times.  The graphics are good.  I have had no problems running this ap.  Would recommend it for both teens and adults.  It will help work your brain.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|this is what i want when i see a horror film!<br /><br />good-a good scary ghost story that actually scares its audience! don't get me wrong, it started slow but then the scares really pick up!<br />bad-i wasn't a huge fan of the setting. the whole old times thing i just wasn't digging it. but that is a personal thing.<br />ugly-although i thought the film was scary, it wasn't as scary as friends talked. according to them certain things stick with you and keep you from sleeping. this wasn't the case for me. i actually wanted to be afraid!<br /><br />final verdict: good-i do recommend this film. it will frighten you, yet at the same time its fun.
030758836X|1.0|Resisted the reviews so I could form my own opinions. As I kept reading I would glance back at the author's photo and wonder why someone who looked so sweet and \\"normal\\" could write  such a perverse and sick book???? As I read her acknowledgements it made me more uncomfortable.  Where does this kind of thinking come from?  As my title says..in the trash on Tuesday.
030758836X|3.0|I felt differently about specific sections of the book.  The first half did not hold my attention.  It dragged on a bit too much.  The second half was fabulous, and I anxiously and excitedly waited to hear how Nick would finally pay Amy back!  That's what kept me reading.  However, when I read the last page on my Kindle, and clicked the next page, I found the \\"acknowledgements.\\"  I agree with other reviewers, that I wanted and hoped for more.  It was a very disappointing ending.  The entire book leaves you waiting to find out exactly how Nick becomes free of his murderess wife, and then---nothing---no resolution of ANY kind that satisfies.  My only thought is that there will be a sequel to \\"Gone Girl.\\"  I don't like building up over 400 pages and then being left with no satisfying conclusion.  This made the what could have been a great book just average.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Over the years, I have come to appreciate Rush much more than I did when they first appeared on the scene. The last few releases, Clockwork Angels included, have been solid efforts that have only added to the band's legendary international stature. A friend purchased this one the week of it's release and loaned it to me after enjoying it several times himself. I agree with his positive assessment and so a copy is in my cart.<br />There have already been hundreds of reviews, most of them favorable. So all I can do is add my thumbs up to an already enormous amen corner. When I first listened, I mentally gave it four stars, but with each listen I hear something new so I've bumped it up to five. Though I enjoy the entire album, my favorite cuts are Caravan, The Anarchist, Seven Cities of Gold, and The Wreckers.<br />The CD is packaged in an attractive digipak and is accompanied by a fat booklet containing album info, the lyrics, and a number of cool images. If you weren't already a Rush fan, you probably wouldn't be reading this. So what are you waiting for? Order it, you can't go wrong.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not crazy about all of Stephen King's books, but this one was a definite winner.  I seriously had a difficult time putting it down.  I was concerned that I didn't have time to read this thick a book....not an issue.  The pages just flew by and I enjoyed the whole story and the whole concept behind the story.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book was extremely disappointing, particularly following all the hype around it. The storyline is completely unrealistic and what I would call childish, were it not for the theme of the book. A good read for someone just looking for paperback pornography, certainly not for anyone who likes a good story.

B00536OCYG|5.0|This review applies to the \\"immersion\\" version (looks all versions of the wall are being thrown in together). I love this album, as you must if you're considering dropping $100-ish for an album everybody and his granny has owned since 1979. Every song on here (final versions anyway) are rated Aces Babillion Infinity Million Stars. I expected the movie versions and extra songs to be included. It's an artistic tragedy that I can't spend any amount of money and own an official release of \\"Empty Spaces / What Shall We Do Now?\\". What shall we do to cope with the fact that we can't buy this song on an album? Shall we buy a new re-release of every Pink Floyd Immersion set? Shall we drive with our iPods plugged into our car systems? Shall we complain on music blogs through the night? Shall we yell at Roger Waters concerts, write record execs, do tours of pirate music sites, keep people as pets, train dogs, raise rats, fill the attic with cash, bury treasure, store up leisure but never relax at all? With our backs to The Wall!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|After reading the book I was skeptical about the movie matching up with it, but this film was nearly right on with the movie.  I wish they had shown how Katniss really received the Mocking Jay pin.  Overall I really enjoyed the movie and thought it was thrilling and entertaining to watch.  I'm excited to see the next movie!  I will be buying it at my local grocery store though; I got this movie there for $5 off and I got free popcorn and candy with my purchase the day it came out on DVD.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is an excellent read. I love the story full of twists, but didn't like the characters so much. I highly recommend it.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|This is my first Jojo Moyes and it was heart wrenching. I spent the last quarter of the book in tears and it stayed with me for the rest of the week. The writing is straight forward and simple. While there are definitely better, more lyrical writers of this genre (Harriet Evans instantly comes to my mind), the character development and pacing was second to none. The love story was tentative and beautiful; a slow, understated creep rather than a whirlwind. The author treated the weighty subject of assisted dying with a light, well-researched, and not-too overly emotive touch paired with two well-thought and fully developed protagonists. These two things together meant that at the end, while some may not agree with the ending, you could at least understand the choices that were made. Worth every penny!

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Best game ever! I believe what people are saying about coins and stuff but thats never happened to me. And its really not that hard to get past 1800 meters once you get the hang of it. My high score is almost 4,000 and I just got the game yesterday. If i had to describe this game, i would say its more addictive than angry birds, more fun than fruit ninja, and more fast paced than temple run. Just try it! BTW your charecter will look awesome if you get honest phil, tuxedo, and shark head jetpack. it takes a long time to save for all that, but its worth it.

0316056863|2.0|She's a funny lady, and we need more of them.  I've been trying to get a laugh from a lot of women in my lifetime, but few can pull it off.  The biography sections about working at the YMCA in Chicago are well written, sincere and worthwhile.  The allusion to the Christmas party of the old and forgotten men is heartbreaking. The section on her honeymoon is very funny.  She has all the requisite bitterness about her early relationships with boys and men you would expect as necessary to create a good commedienne (that's not a sexist word, is it?).  Once she talks about SNL, she gets too serious, especially recounting her interview with Lorne Michaels, leading to her initial SNL employment.  Frankly, I stopped reading when she started talking about working on the show... insider stuff, in my estimation. She has fantastic legs, but let's hope there is no sequel to this...

1612930425|5.0|Blame Jane - Austen that is - for The Marriage Plot: the idea that a woman's ambition and happiness rests solely upon marriage to a man; and that she is free to use any means to land her man, including to a great degree: gossip, deceit, and deception. In addition, she need not worry that he is not the ideal man, for she can mold him into what it is she wants because he is witless--putty in her hands. Unless he is a scoundrel, who turns the plot upside down on an unsuspecting nubile. Cheers, Mr. Wickham.<br /><br />Nora Roberts owes Austen for her fortune and success. Austen was the pioneer that many other romance writers have followed. Not only writers, but including real girls and women for, apparently, centuries, right on up to today; and is responsible for much of marriage's misery (sometimes for some people.) For some, I know, The Marriage Plot works.<br /><br />Jane Austen was a young, little (Actually, I don't know if she was little or what she looked like - but I do know she had one fine imagination.) twerp--writing wishful fantasies in her attic about things she had little experience with, having never been married, or `properly in love,' or, \\"`violently in love.\\"' Thank goodness she didn't write sex scenes.<br /><br />Oh Miss Bennet, no not you Jane, or you Mary, or her niece, or the other sister, or her cousin, or his cousin - yes, you Elizabeth, the creature that is Mr. Bennet's daughter, or should I call you Lizzy? Eliza? The writing is often confusing and redundant and nothing happens but gossip and sideways conversations - which is probably accurate for the times. It certainly is today. So there is that. If Austen were alive today she might be a stand-up comic. She's funny, and if you can muddle through the bad writing - amusing and entertaining. I struggled to finish the book, but then I'm not a fan of The Marriage Plot nor bad writing. Nevertheless - five stars because she was way ahead of her time - a true pioneer.

I have had this app a while and have gotten very far along.I had completed a lot of quest and expanded my land quite a bit.Then after an update some how the land I gad purchased was no longer mine but all of my stuff was on it still I just could not get to it without repurchasing the land and trees had grown up everywhere. Some of my things were moved scattered around. It was very frustrating to have gotten so far along and then have it glitch on me. Before that happened ILOVED the game.
B00129I5SM|5.0|I was very happy with the vender.  I received it well before the date given on the recept.  The bonus features were out of this world.

B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I didn't get very far into the book because I couldn't. This book lacks the grab from page one of like so many other series like Dragonlance, Sword of Shannara, Wheel of Time, The Dwarves, Name of the Wind, the list goes on and on. Yes, I know some of the titles I listed are pretty much night and day from the dark and brooding world of Steven Erikson, but I feel at least the Game of Thrones universe can compare when it comes to minute detail, and an engrossing world of political intrigue and violence.<br /><br />I can't quite put my finger on it, but fifty pages into the book, this is what I got :Some girl with candles gets abducted by mages? Mages are bad? The emperor died, the new one is not very nice, some evil dudes in a floating castle above some town are really bad, ugh....it was just slogging through the detail after detail. It's like politely listening to someone describe a hobby or a book in extreme excruciating detail while providing you with really nothing to hold your attention. Bleh.
B000FBJF78|5.0|I love this series! It takes me back to a visit I had in Africa and reminds me of the life and the living of it there. The pride that the African people have for their country is clearly conveyed in the writings of this book and the in the series.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|I purchased this a few weeks after it came out and it did not dissapoint.  I can take it to work, to friends house, hotel and just about anywhere else with ease.  The audio is lacking but I have high end gaming headphones so it doesn't matter.  It would be nice if the brightness could go a little bit higher and its a little tough for a 2nd person to watch at an angle but I think they addressed it in the newer version which has a slightly bigger screen and supports the Kinnect system.<br /><br />When carrying it I always got alot of questions due to it looking like a bulky laptop case but people were always amazed once they saw what it was.  I will definitely be getting  a 2nd one for the next gen systems.  I honestly don't even hook up my xbox to my big screen tvs anymore.  Picture is great for being an LED screen too.

B007X4ECMI|5.0|[[ASIN:B007X4ECLY Lockout (Unrated Edition) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />Completely implausible, but eminently watchable. Full of sci-fi eye candy, snappy dialogue and innovative action. Unrated upgrades the violence and gore.<br /><br />If you're a nitpicker, skip it. Physics are haywire and common sense is out the door.<br /><br />But you know, it's the journey. Style can be substantial, even on a thin plot. Production values are superb and the look is right and gritty. Guy Pearce fits the role perfectly in a badass way, and the hate/love relationship with Maggie Grace is right-on. Great performances include the maniac brother and cryo-addled sidekick, and the traitor's monologue (at the end).<br /><br />Add some killer action scenes and you might catch a \\"wow\\" under your breath. It's a fun ride.<br /><br />PS. I nominate Guy Pearce as Altered Carbon's Takechi Kovacs.

B006LSZECO|5.0|With over 1600 reviews posted, there isn't a lot I can add and I really don't want to give any spoilers away so I am not going to say a lot.<br /><br />What I would like to share is that this was a book that grabbed my attention early on and I wanted to keep reading even when I should have put it down.  The story unfolds slowly and you get glimpses that things may not be as they appear, but I had no idea where it was going.  About the time I thought I might know what happened, there would be a twist that totally threw me off balance.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end and will be reading this author's other novels based upon this one.<br /><br />There has been a lot of discussion about the ending, with many people hating it and feeling strongly about that.  In my case, I had no problem with how the book ended.  It seemed to fit the twists and turns of the rest of the book and I thought it was very fitting.<br /><br />Totally absorbing, suspenseful novel that I enjoyed (reminding me a bit of \\"Defending Jacob\\" which I also loved).

B00782O7NE|2.0|If you can't do remake of \\"Singing in the rain\\" do a rip-off. However, shoes to fill are too big. It does get 2 stars for trying.<br /><br />Several scenes are directly lifted from \\"Singing in the rain\\". Even though Gene Kelly is mentioned once in extra materials \\"Singing in the rain\\" never is.<br /><br />Acting by Jean Dujardin is often cringe-inducing. Bérénice Bejo is better. James Cromwell is always good.<br /><br />I just didn't care about any of the characters except for the dog.
B0049VVE7Y|2.0|The quality of The walking dead was very poor.  I highly advise anyone interested in this product to order the DVD's and ignore the digital DL.

B0084IHVC0|3.0|Even if you keep this, do not sell your previously released DVD of this movie! They boosted the color and added harsher lines, so it lost the softness of the original drawings and the flavor of real life with the pumped-up colors. Really - the skin colors are bright pink instead of beige, for instance. The soft watercolors now look like harsh marker drawings. I bought this for the subtitles in other languages, since the DVD only had English, but regretted it when I saw how awful they made it look. I guess they realized that children prefer stronger contrasts and more primary colors, but the original is a work of art, even the slate roofs look romantic in the original. In the new version it's still cute but far less beautiful. Alas. To me this is one of the best Disney movies of all time. And, by changing the colors it's like we're trying to raise our kids to learn bad taste. I love Disney but does everything have to be the same? This movie was an inspired creation. Why not show THAT to kids?
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I was a little app rehensive (bad joke),  after several reviewer's stated having a problem with this app once it was installed on their Kindle Fired. I threw caution to the wind, since there were so many tiny bugs at dire risk that needed saving, and I'm glad that I did. It runs perfectly fine on my Kindle Fire,  and it's really quite an unusual,  fun &amp; thought provoking game.  I recommend this to any Fire owner that enjoys a good puzzle. Don't let the cuteness of the graphics fool you! It can be a challenge at the upper levels while in the &quot;Hard&quot; setting. Enjoy!

It is interesting to read word written back in the 1870 and 1880 and compare the characters to how we protect our youth today.  These characters were allowed to grow and develope without the hovering protection that is so prevelant today.<br />I have sat and read this novel at lunch and have laughed outloud.  If you have read this as a youth, take time to read it again.  If you have never read this, take the time to go back to a time that was free and ready for youthful exeuberance.

0374203032|4.0|Thomas Carlyle's famous characterization of economics as \\"the dismal science\\" has led in more recent years to a fundamental questioning of whether its a science at all. The character of Leo McGarry in the brilliant \\"West Wing\\" once stated that \\"economists were put on the earth to make astrologers look good,\\" and despite a few notable exceptions the profession not only missed the burgeoning problems leading to the current crisis but didn't really recognise its true scale when it all exploded. It led Paul Krugman in a famous article in the New York Times to question \\"How did economists get it so wrong\\". Not least the masters of universe Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke who as late as 2005 were dismissing the idea that house prices and the massive bubble they created posed any serious threat. Michael J. Sandel is the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Government at Harvard University, he also gave a stimulating set of Reith lectures in 2009 and more recently was interviewed on Radio 4s Today programme on his excellent and very readable new book \\"What money cant buy\\". He was also viciously attacked by a range of some of the best and brightest current economists (the term is used loosely) for suggesting after the Kyoto conference that US demands for signing up to climate change protocols on the condition they include a trading scheme allowing countries to buy and sell the right to pollute were morally wrong. Sandel argued persuasively against this and observed that letting countries buy the right to pollute was like letting people pay to litter. For those who cannot come to face with the fact that financial markets do fall far short of perfection this was heretical stuff and Sandel felt their wrath in letters and columns.<br /><br />Times have changed and it would be hoped that those whose views were so mesmerised by markets and so far wrong would be eating a large slice of humble pie. Yet Sandal's book remains one of the few contributions that questions what extent and role should markets play and crucially isn't their something wrong with a world in which everything is for sale. As Sandel ironically observes over the past 5 years \\"the spectacular failure of financial markets did little to dampen the faith in markets generally. In fact the financial crisis discredited government more than banks\\". This disillusionment with politics Sandel sees as a massive problem. At a time when we need reasoned public debate we are lumbered with a \\"rancorous politics.. whose problem is not too much moral argument but too little\\". Sandel is fundamentally concerned with inequality and he examines the growing phenomenon of being financially able to jump the queue whether through \\"Lexus lanes' on US highways, prisoners paying for \\"cell upgrades\\", \\"gifts\\" to prestigious universities to admit your child and many more. As a theorist of justice, Sandell is certainly not a left wing socialist or arguing that all markets are bad. What he is concerned about is the loss of a moral compass and in his showstopper that \\"The most fateful change that unfolded in the last three decades was not an increase in greed. It was the expansion of markets, and of market values, into spheres of life where they don't belong.\\" In the last analysis it raises that fundamental question for human beings on how we want to live together. The gnawing gulf between rich and poor increases and we witness \\"wide screen TV riots\\" in the UK. Are there things in terms of a common life that money shouldn't buy?<br /><br />In a country with a NHS it is often puzzling for UK citizens to look at the row over the limited reforms of Barack Obama on health which has led to the accusation in some parts of the Republican right that he is a communist! But the future of the NHS in England at least is subject to a great debate on potential marketization and many trusts are crushed by the burdens of PFI debts. Inevitably this leads to the big justice questions that Sandel raised in his Reith lectures on tax policy, the contribution of the rich and income equalisation. The point about \\"What money cant buy\\" however is to change the terms of the debate from one of market infatuation to another which clearly sees market limitation as a moral objective. It is not a particularly earthshaking synopsis and undoubtedly Marxist theorists which berate its lack of radicalism and historical sweep. But is does make you think and starts to change the terms of the debate. Sandell should be thanked for this and for pointing out that Bruce Springsteen at least gets it when he forgoes $4m by charging $95 for a ticket to his homecoming New Jersey concerts when the Stones charged $450 dollars for the same venue. Shame on you Mick and Keith!s on tax policy, the contribution of the rich and income equalisation.

B004XISI4A|1.0|This series DOES NOT qualify George Martin as \\"the American Tolkien\\" - a quick review might more accurately say \\"a book of bad menus, weak plots, plenty of fill to disturb the flow of what little story there is, and overweening characters that are impossible to identify with unless you live your life on a teenage page of Facebook\\". If you're a reader who thinks Robert Jordan lost his way with the Wheel of Time series, (or may be his editors were milking the money) don't read this book.

B008I34ZQG|5.0|\\"Sheik Yerbouti\\" is one of Zappa's most popular titles, and it's easy to understand why; it revels in unabashed smutty humor, but pairs those sentiments with possibly the crunchiest rock arrangements to ever emanate from the UMRK. That's no coincidence, as Zappa's band at this point included the unbelievably talented Terry Bozzio, Patrick O'Hearn, and others, and featured the vocal stylings and guitar of short-lived Zappa sideman Adrian Belew. What surprises many, too, is that \\"Sheik\\"'s basic tracks were all recorded live in concert (\\"Hammersmith Odeon,\\" a Zappa family release, covers much of the same ground) and later overdubbed in the studio.<br /><br />Despite being one of the more feted entries in Zappa's later catalog, \\"Sheik\\" has had a less-than-glorious history in the digital age. Apart from a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reissue from EMI records in the 1980s, all \\"Sheik\\" CDs prior to now were made from a digital master that reflected some of the worst of Zappa's 1980s-era tendency to tamper with his catalog. Songs were edited, in some cases understandably (\\"I'm So Cute\\" to segue into \\"Jones Crusher\\"), and and in others arbitrarily (\\"Wild Love\\"). Worse, Zappa's attempt at innovative equalization backfired, lending the album a slightly hollow sound; and the digital workstation he and Bob Stone used was malfunctioning, blessing the right channel with a tendency to pump in and out throughout the album. Thus, up until 2012, the wisdom was always \\"find the EMI CD.\\"<br /><br />Thankfully, this 2012 reissue from UMe restores the album to its proper state. Remastered by Bob Ludwig (who mastered the original vinyl), it restores \\"I'm So Cute\\" and otherwise undoes the Zappa tampering--this is pretty much how the record sounded in 1979. As it is, this is one of the most welcome updates of the 2012 reissue program, and is an essential purchase for any Zappa enthusiasts whose sole copy of the album is a non-EMI CD.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Very good read, but a bit choppy (it's more a compilation of Mark's blog posts than an actual book).<br /><br />Pros: blunt, honest, insightful, only got to be right once, easy read...<br /><br />Cons: a bit choppy, wished Mark would've gone into a bit more details in some areas..<br /><br />Worth the price--cheaper than a latte.  Perfect for young entrepreneurs who are thinking of grinding or who are in the midst of the grind.
B008I34ZG6|5.0|This is the one with \\"Montana,\\" \\"Dinah-Moe Humm,\\" \\"Dirty Love,\\" and \\"I'm the Slime\\" on it. Make of that what you will. This album and Apostrophe(') were originally paired together on CD, and for good reason: they're pretty similar, although Apostrophe is more whimsical and \\"Sensation\\" smuttier by a country mile. It's an enjoyable, if slightly disjointed, romp, and \\"Camarillo Brillo\\" must rank as one of Zappa's best pop achievements.<br /><br />All earlier CDs of \\"Sensation\\" applied a slight bit of digital reverb throughout the album, which was most noticeable on tracks like \\"Montana.\\" The 2012 reissue from UMe sounds great and reverts to the dry presentation of the original LP, and is therefore an essential upgrade.

B000MGUZM0|4.0|Neon Bible is AF's darkest album. The songs are sung with so much resentment, it's like Butler has chains all around him but the band will still get him out. \\"My Body is a Cage\\" is a song I won't forget for years to come. Peter Gabriel's rendition is brilliant too. \\"Black Mirror\\" is so different from their previous album opener but it really really clinches the listener's mood. Songs like \\"Neon Bible\\" , \\"Intervention\\" and \\"ATB\\" ensure this is a wonderful traveling album.<br />The highlight of the album is \\"The Well and the lighthouse\\"<br /><br />\\"No Cars Go\\" is probably my least favourite song on the album but then I heard the Arcade Fire perform it at Chicago last year and I started liking that too.<br /><br />\\"There's this fear I keep so deep<br />Knew it's name since before I could sleep, yeah, oh<br />They know my name cause I told it to them<br />But they don't know where<br />They don't know when .. ITS COMING!<br />ON WHEN IT'S COMING....\\" [lyrics from Keep the car running are optimistic]<br /><br />NEON BIBLE is a very important Arcade Fire record but one where the message delivered doesn't seem to appraise it's value immediately. These songs are like an assorted mix of good listening but they aren't as hard hitting as Arcade Fire usually are. Besides wanting another song from Regine, I wouldn't change a thing about Neon Bible.<br /><br />PS  - This record lacks a song like \\"In the backseat\\" or \\"Sprawl ii\\" by Regine and therefore seems incomplete in comparison to the other two records.

055357342X|5.0|The third book in George R. R. Martin's monstrous A Song of Ice and Fire series has one less king than its predecessor, but that still leaves five, by my count, and it's the Lannisters who are sitting pretty in the seat that matters most of all - the Iron Throne. A Storm of Swords covers a much wider range of Martin's world than either of the previous two books. With an exception of Tyrion and Sansa, no two character perspectives are in the same place, and where they are in the world varies widely. From Jon beyond the wall to Daenerys across the sea we have a glimpse of everything, except for the Iron Islands where Balon Greyjoy has crowned himself king. And not only is the scope of book three much larger, its storylines are better developed and it is much more emotionally resonant than the previous two. It's almost impossible to know what to expect from this roller coaster of a novel.<br /><br />In his documentary, Grizzly Man, Werner Herzog says, \\"I believe the common character of the universe is not harmony, but hostility, chaos and murder.\\" Martin's series seems to follow that line of thought as well. Robert Barratheon's death after being king for nearly 20 years has left his old position in a tenuous state, as armies have risen to support six kings, now five with the death of one of them. Honor is an admirable characteristic to have, but as we've seen with Ned Stark, treachery wins the day in Martin's chaotic world. Even the disciplined and orderly Night's Watch falls prey to the chaos of the undead, though their discipline is the trait that would serve them best against Mance Rayder's undisciplined army. Martin doesn't create a world where good will inevitably triumph over evil. We don't know what will happen. This is where Martin's fantasy series departs from many other stories of heroes and villains. In those stories we know who is the hero and who is the villain, and thus we know who will win, but in Martin's series there is no clear-cut good or evil. There are good acts and evil acts, and any character is just as capable of committing one as the other.<br /><br />I would argue this is the best of the series so far. It has more warmth than the second novel, with some romance between Jon and Ygritte, among others, and the bonds of friendship developed between Arya and Gendry. Though at the same time events in the book had me very upset and despairing over the situation of characters I liked. There was much more feeling in this book than there was in the second book. It does help that we don't have the perspective of someone like Theon, who was immensely unlikeable, and even sickening. As mean as Jaime Lannister can be, at least he's funny. And what he has to say about Brienne does have some truth. She's not a very interesting character. Each individual story is much better developed this time around. There are more surprises along the way here, where A Clash of Kings relied on momentum from the end of the first book, a surprise assassination halfway through, and an exciting battle at the end of the novel. The events in A Storm of Swords are more personal to each character and I felt more deeply for them because of this. I'm very curious to see what Martin does in his next, A Feast of Crows.are good acts and evil acts, and any character is just as capable of committing one as the other.<br /><br />I would argue this is the best of the series so far.

0345535421|4.0|If you look at the history of real civilizations, you'll find that they all go through periods of dark ages, when chaos rules and rulers find their grasp on power tenuous and the people don't feel safe. By the end of George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones, that is exactly where the the Seven Kingdoms finds itself. As you might guess from the title, there is more than one king, and they're not exactly friendly with one another. Some are willing to share the kingdom; others aren't. The desire for power is stronger than the need for peace. What Martin does in A Clash of Kings, the second installment of his A Song of Ice and Fire series, is create the sense that nobody is safe, that anything can change on a whim, and that the crown is guaranteed for none.<br /><br />One of the critiques I have for the first book, is that very little attention is spent on religion. That is not the case here. We get to know the religion of the Stark's religion better, which has something to do with praying the godswood. Catelyn's family, and many others, prays to the new gods, seven in all, with the likes of the Mother and the Warrior. The Greyjoys pray to the Drowned Gods, perhaps because they are situated on an island. Stannis has formed an alliance with a priestess named Melisandre, who prays to the God of Light, her religion being the only monotheistic one in the novel. I find it difficult to imagine an epic series like this to play out with little reference to religion, but Martin fortunately devotes a little more time to it here.<br /><br />A Clash of Kings starts off faster than A Game of Thrones. The prologue is better and we already know most of the main players and events. We learn more about some of the characters, such as Theon, though others like Dany fall under the radar. There is more sex and more violence this time around, or at least it seems more graphic, not that this is an improvement. I think Martin goes too far at times, but the HBO series takes it even further, sometimes including scenes that add nothing to the development of the plot or characters. I think the end of the novel falters in comparison to the first book. Where A Game of Thrones left off with several jaw-dropping cliffhangers, A Clash of Kings ends less climatically. There is an epic battle at the end, but how it concludes feels a little too convenient. A few characters have unknown fates, some stake off on adventures, but mostly nothing so impressive happens that I feel I can't wait to start the next book. I don't mean to say this is not a great novel, as it really is, and it still leaves me clamoring for more. The series truly is one of a kind, and I can't think of any other fantasy world that feels so real and is so well-developed and full of surprises. In a way, I wish it never ended.etimes including scenes that add nothing to the development of the plot or characters. I think the end of the novel falters in comparison to the first book.

B000TRXRUY|5.0|If you consider yourself a martial arts movie fan, then you have to have seen Enter the Dragon. This is the quintessential martial arts movie, hands down, bar none. For starters, the mythology surrounding events that occurred (supposedly) during the making of this movie are outrageous (Bruce Lee getting his hand cut during one of the fight scenes with Bob Wall, extras supposedly challenging him to spar/fight on the set, etc). And, there are so many great one-liners in Enter the Dragon (especially those belonging to actor and martial artist Jim Kelly). But besides that, the fight scenes were way ahead of this movie's time. Props to Jackie Chan, Tony Jaa, Donnie Yen, Sammo Hung, and yes, even Chuck Norris... but Bruce Lee was and still is the king of the Hong Kong martial arts action movie genre, and this is his crowning achievement.
1451696205|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a novel about intelligent high school kids. Hollywood likes to think audiences only want to hear about the dumb ones who do nothing but party, talk about the opposite sex, and have no ideas of their own. I hope the movie starring Emma Watson doesn't follow this tradition. Because Stephen Chbosky has written a novel that allows teenagers to have their own ideas and even be wise. Of course, there is still partying, drugs, sex, love, and all of that stuff, but that's part of growing up. And Chbosky handles it in a mature way.<br /><br />The novel is written in the form of letters from Charlie to an anonymous person. This adds a sense of intimacy to the novel. It's as though Charlie's writing the letters and sharing his experiences with you, the reader. I grew to like Charlie. He's overemotional and cries a lot, and he seems unhappy more than he is happy. I would say that's part of being a teenager, because it is, but Charlie's definitely different than most teenagers. In addition to being very sensitive, he is very smart. He reads and enjoys books like To Kill A Mockingbird and A Separate Peace, books most high schoolers despise with a passion. I liked Charlie from the start, but these feelings were cemented in a touching scene where he discovers sympathy for George Bailey in A Wonderful Life, the character who gets drunk and squanders the money that forces Jimmy Stewart to sacrifice his dreams. He wishes the movie were from George Bailey's perspective because he wants to believe that George's life has meaning. Like I said, Charlie's a bright kid.<br /><br />Despite all of this focus on sorrow, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a soothing read due to its poetic language. Chbosky so accurately reflects high school life that it made me think back to my high school days. My first crush. My first heartache. Like Charlie, I was amazed when somebody else regarded me as a somebody, rather than the nobody I acted like I was. That was why Bill wanted him to participate, and so do Sam and Patrick. What Chbosky's trying to say is that you can learn a lot by being a wallflower, but to experience life and feel \\"infinite\\" requires that you actually do something rather than wait for it to happen. You might be surprised by the results.l wanted him to participate, and so do Sam and Patrick.

As the editor points out, the aim of this Handbook is `to make available, in a convenient and up to date format, the full text of the most important company law statutes statutory instruments and European legislation'.<br /><br />Reflecting the fact that the Companies Act 2006 regime has largely superseded that established by the 1985 Act, this year's edition contains any amount of new material.  In the past year alone, as the editor reminds us, the Companies Act 2006 and FSM Act 2000 has between them, been amended by a dozen different enactments.  This of course is only one example among many new developments examined in this edition of the Handbook.<br /><br />To cite just a few examples, new material includes that pertaining to overseas companies... supervision of accounts and reports... statutory auditors... and much more, including the Prospectus Regulations 2012.<br /><br />The book is divided into twelve parts -- detailed in the Table of Contents -- with Parts 1 to 4 covering the Companies Act 2006. The Act is presented in full, including all amendments and detailed notes.  Parts 5 and 6 deal with pre-2006  companies primary legislation and statutory instruments, while Parts 7 and 8 examine the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, (FSMA), including statutory instruments.<br /><br />Miscellaneous other primary legislation and other statutory instruments comprise Parts 9 and 10 followed by considerable EU material in Part 11, dealing with such areas as insolvency, market abuse, takeovers, transparency... and more.<br /><br />As you would expect of a volume of this magnitude, (over 3.500 pages, we estimate) there are ample research resources.  There is an index of at least sixty pages and a glossary  of words and phrases, both indicating  the unique paragraph number, or numbers pertaining to each phrase or provision rather than page numbers.<br /><br />The law is stated as at July 2012, but if you need continuing updates, note that there is an electronic version of the Handbook updated fortnightly as part of the Lexis Library Service.  There is also a CD version updated monthly and available from LexisNexis.by considerable EU material in Part 11, dealing with such areas as insolvency, market abuse, takeovers, transparency... and more.<br /><br />As you would expect of a volume of this magnitude, (over 3.500 pages, we estimate) there are ample research resources.

184980396X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moH31TIX7R087K]]<br /><br />STUDENTS AND FINANCIAL SERVICES PRACTITIONERS -- FURTHER INTERNATIONAL DEBATE ON EXECUTIVE PAY<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />How do you determine what is - and what isn't - a fair and just level of executive pay? In the light of major recent financial scandals -- too various to mention here -- the legal and financial communities, as well as the general public, have been hearing almost endlessly about executive pay and the massive salaries  -- usually seven figures plus bonuses -- earned by one CEO after another.<br /><br />Result:  a controversial and endlessly debatable topic on which this book, recently published by Edward Elgar Publishing, sheds considerable light and is a most welcome commentary.<br /><br />Part of the descriptively titled `Research Handbooks in Corporate Law and Governance' series from Elgar, the book has been produced with the obvious editorial aim  of subjecting this vexed subject to extensive, yet thorough scrutiny.<br /><br />Rather than a collection of learned essays gleaned from various academic journals worldwide, the articles contained within this quite fascinating work of reference - all extensively footnoted -- have all been specially commissioned by the editors to provide a wealth of informed, up-to-date commentary on the latest contributions to this debate worldwide from top scholars in this field.<br /><br />The scholarship in question hails from no less than thirty-seven contributors from as many universities worldwide.  Yale, Oxford and the LSE are represented, as well as the University of Southern California, the Cranfield University School of Management, as well as more universities in America, China, Australia, India and a number of EU member countries including Germany.<br /><br />The editors Randall S. Thomas and Jennifer G. Hill are from Vanderbilt Law School, USA and Sydney Law School, respectively. So you cannot say that the book doesn't present the various issues involved from a global perspective!<br /><br />The book is logically divided into four parts grouped under the headings of `history and theory'...`the structure of executive pay'... corporate governance'... and international perspectives on executive pay.<br /><br />Key debates include, for example, government regulation of executive pay -- a policy which we doubt would be popular in the UK, with its hugely important financial services industry.  Some theorists would support government regulation, although guardedly.  Others argue that politicians are unsuited to intervening in labour markets... and that the courts, not to mention the hapless shareholders, know less about pay levels than directors: amply illustrated by the `Shareholder Spring' of 2012.<br /><br />Whatever your opinion on this subject, the book just might lead you either to altering it, or substantiating it.  The book does provide copious resources for further research in the form of footnotes, extensive bibliographies at the end of each article and a detailed index at the back.<br /><br />With its global perspective and erudite approach, this book would certainly be an asset to anyone involved professionally or academically in any matters relating to executive pay.nnot say that the book doesn't present the various issues involved from a global perspective!<br /><br />The book is logically divided into four parts grouped under the headings of `history and theory'...`the structure of executive pay'... corporate governance'... and international perspectives on executive pay.<br /><br />Key debates include, for example, government regulation of executive pay -- a policy which we doubt would be popular in the UK, with its hugely important financial services industry.

B000JSI7BM|5.0|I LOVED this Movie and bought 3 blu ray copies!!<br />  You must view it from more than one perspective..First it is about how you friends can get downright nasty and jealous when you succeed. It is about growing up and pursuing a career path.. I was SO disappointed when Andrea quit her career with Runway... she should have went all the way!!! That Bitch boyfriend left her anyway..her other friends where happy to receive expensive gifts BUT should have backed her up..They just put her down..<br />After all that was said an done she is on her own ...Life gives you a chance ..TAKE IT... the American culture does not care about newspapers and journalists..<br /><br />I LOVED the beautiful women and how they got dressed in the opening scenes..NICE legs and Great Louboutin heels!!  walking down the street... It is just worth it to buy it for how the women dress up!!!When Andrea got the Jimmy Choo shoes..I had to find that particular style..got it and love them...<br /><br />Great lesson on Life ..You get that one chance to make it big...TAKE IT don't be foolish.. Miranda had it right..If you are going to succeed nobody will like you..cause everyone is Selfish in this New world order culture..

B0063IH60K|4.0|fair to decent solitaire game.  ads sick but that's. the price for a free app.  played about over 50 times before I even came any close to winning a hand.  this just made me want to beat the computer more than ever.
B004SB60OC|5.0|Loved this album! Every song is great! It has some range in style, and does not disappoint! Christina Perri is a breath of fresh air, in a choking industry.

0345803485|1.0|I just can't believe how bad this book is. The writing is horrible!!!  The author uses the word crap and blushed or blushing about 100 times in the first 20 pages!  Seriously?  Only 45 year old housewives from PIttsburgh use the word crap anymore.  I know...I moved here two years ago from NYC.  I am pissed I bought into the hype on this \\"book\\".

0345803485|1.0|I requested the first of the three from the library and was highly dissapointed. The story line is aweful and it was just a big waste of time. Highly overrated book.
B006Z9K97E|5.0|It took me two days to read the book. It will take me much longer to think it through.<br /><br />Author provides the story in a context, in a calm, non-sensational way. Yet you'll struggle to put the book down and not end reading it till morning. The story is very strong.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Very good book; 3rd of the series.  BIGGEST complaint is that the Kindle versions of these books number the chapters with no title.  Each chapter is a story related to a particular character and picks up where the last chapter on that character ended.  Without chapter titles (which are character's names), it is difficult to navigate back to see what was happening to that character at the end of his/hers last chapter.  Have had to make my on list of chapter names.  Don't understand why the chapter titles are not included in the Kindle versions.

B004LROUW2|2.0|I have read almost everything that Haruki Murakami has written and consider him one of the finest writers working today.<br />1Q84 is the exception to the rule. I found it boring, far too repetitive, much too long, and, for me, most importantly, it lacked the spontaneous ease of entry into the all too real, totally believable, fantasy worlds he created in his other works of fiction, beginning with DANCE DANCE DANCE.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Great fun for every age!  Love all the graphics and sounds. Levels are challenging sometimes as you get more in the game; but, that is what makes it so much fun!  Thanks.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I stop using the app after the previous, previous update because the the zoom function got all messed up after that update. I recently reinstall the app and found page view load at a perfect size for reading with an 7 inch tablet. This app is worth the money, just until the next update.
1424840945|4.0|NB: Some other reviews seem to be about a book, not the film 'Ghandi' - not sure where the mix up is...<br /><br />If only the film was a little deeper, a little more complex, it could have been an all time great epic. As it is, it comes close.<br /><br />The pluses; the power of the story and the history, and Ben Kingsley's amazing performance, which, somehow, like Gandhi himself, is both modest and incredibly powerful.<br /><br />The minuses; many of the supporting characters are underdeveloped, sometimes to the point of caricature.  Most of the `villains' (the British, the leader of the Muslim separatist movement) are presented as one dimensional cartoons that Gandhi himself probably would have disapproved of as lacking compassion and understanding.<br /><br />Also, there's a feeling, despite it's 3+hour length, that we really never get to know Gandhi as a human being, not just a &#34;great, historic figure&#34;.<br /><br />The best moments in the film are his moments of self-doubt and questioning, as well as his complex family life, but those are few and far between.<br /><br />Still, an epic telling of one of the most important, influential and inspiring people of the last 500 years, and well worth seeing.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app. Lots of useful information. Liked the free version enough to upgrade to the Pro version. Highly recommended if you're looking for more information about your battery and power usage.
B003L77GGA|5.0|The blu-ray has a great image quality, in a compact casing. The holding of the disc is firm, yet easy to remove, not requiring lots of disc bending while trying to do that.<br /><br />Can't judge the episodes itself, as only my sister has seen them

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved all three of these books! I am sad that it ended but it was an awesome read. I couldn't put my kindle fire down until I finished them. It drew me in. Hot and Steamy (:
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Am an avid reader but this is the first book written by George R.R.Martin that I have read. I originally purchased this book to help me follow the series, Game of thrones which is highly structured with heaps of characters and villages, kingdoms etc. Now I'm hooked  and have another author to add to my favourites list.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Great game, it guesses very obscure characters. Highly recommended for fans of games like 20q! I played it before on my phone and this app is better.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|\\"UniWar\\" is a very enjoyable turn based strategy game that is easy to learn and challenging to play. I like turn based games over real time games since my reflexes are not what they once were.<br /><br />This is a feature packed app that supports single and multi-player modes (network or on the same device). The Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a very good game and has beaten me more often than I like to admit. The interface is well designed and it was easy to navigate the controls and master the basic game play.<br /><br />The app installed and ran perfectly on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B00932A2MC|5.0|OK it's an action movie keep that in mind with the acting. Liam Neeson is great but not a big part of the movie. But for Fun and action and bringing in an old WWII battle ship to kick some just adds to fun. Music sound track is a huge plus too.
B008OBPGQK|5.0|I really love hearing the live versions of songs I know inside and out. Yes, every song from the original studio release isn't here, probably because they don't play every track off every album live. But since they're not charging a full album price that's fine. I was lucky to get this and a few of their other live releases for 99c each (crazy, I know). I wouldn't pay regular price for it, but that's because I rarely pay full price for anything. I wait for sale prices,deals, mp3 credits, and request Amazon gift cards for b-days, Christmas, ect.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|in my book, four stars is a good rating. works very well, but I'm not that  technical, so i can't speak for all the features. kills my open apps, clears cache ram and frees up memory, which preserves battery life and keeps my kindle fire running smoothly.  a winner app. try it.. you'll like it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am loving this book & ordering Amazon Kindle was super easy! I am not the most tech knowelegable person! It so clear & have different viewing options! I will order more book via Amazon Kindle!
B008NMT684|4.0|My two year old enjoys this. Pics are nice. Puzzles are easy. BUT I have to change parental settings on Kindle Fire to download extras OR keep clicking no to go back and explain to my son that he can't choose certain options. Make it easier to BUY the extras.
0062197258|5.0|I highly recomend this book. Its got a great storyline plus lots of suspense<br />that builds up chapter after chapter. You'll find yourself not wanting to put it down. Cant wait for this authors next book hopefully its as great as this one.
1469984202|5.0|I haven't read a sci-fi in awhile, and stumbed upon this.  Amazing story!  Well told - richly painted characters & environments, this one will be in my thoughts a long time.  I'll definitely be looking for the next installment.
B001D7TW8U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie..so much so I bought it and I always watch it when it comes on cable. I love the perspective painted of Henry VIII being weak when it came to women throughout his reign. I loved that even though Elizabeth's mother was a hott mess of a human being ( thanks to her family ) she still gave birth to one of the most feared and respected rulers in English history. I loved Scarlett Johanssen's performance she was great. I really enjoyed the film. The Tudors were totally dysfunctional! very entertaining...I highly recommend. Great if you love period piece movies
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book is a great example of good writing. Arguments are structured well. Examples are good and illustrate the point being made very well.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the author would be to provide different headings for different topics such as: Personal context, Company context, and Society context.<br /><br />This would help reader to set the context better. The last chapter gave good illustration of how to consciously identify cues, routines and rewards for personal context. It will be cool to come up with similar chapter for company and society contexts.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|An incredible album for a band that's been around nearly 40 years.  From Caravan to The Garden, Clockwork Angels might be Rush's best work.  Yes, Geddy Lee doesn't have the voice he once did.  But in the scheme of things, his voice is much more mature and accessible than his banshee days which helps propel the story of a young man's journey through life's adventures that much more.  The musicianship, as always, is incredible but there is something that Rush really hadn't developed until later in life; a groove.  Many of the songs just groove, especially the almost sexy sounding \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\".  \\"The Garden\\" is an absolute gem, a beautiful reminder that it's all about how we live our life and the kind of people we are more so than the things we may have accomplished.  \\"It's a measure of a life\\" should be every persons motto.<br /><br />\\"Clockwork Angels\\" is a must have not only for Rush fans but for any fan of rock that may be looking for something much more rich, in depth and rocking than any of the top 40 drivel that is constantly shoved down our throats.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A must read...couldn't put the book down!!! It kept my interest like no other book I've read. I would definitely recommend this book.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|excellent small graphics. wish they were a little larger. of all the match three games I think this is one of the best. plays very well on my kindle fire. took forever to load but the wait was worth it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is pretty awesome! The games are fun for anyone and they can get addicting. Definately a good way to pass the time. There is truly 128 games and that is the best part. Why download a bunch of apps when you can have many games here.?

B008M34INW|5.0|Where do you start with a Mel Gibson Film. First off, we need to dispense with what I consider totally uncalled for Hollywood Cliche and gunplay whackery and quackery. I hope that I am not alone on this, but the trademark Mel Gibson automatic side-ways shooting thing should end, hopefully before Mel's career does. The vast majority of authoritative gun experts say there is every disadvantage and no advantage whatsoever in using this form of gunplay. Mel has played every kind of criminal, cop, action hero or pistolero there is. But whatever his role, no matter how sleazy or cheesy, he has always been a very sharp guy in his role. So why does he use this side gun technique worthy only of a punk wanna-be gangster? The ultimate idiocy in this technique is when the side-wielding punk pushes the pistol forward as he is shooting. As if that will make the bullet go faster. It is almost impossible to hit anyone or anything with this technique. I was so bothered by this that I did some research; and yes there might be one advantage to side fire...If you are running away from the scene of the crime and you want to slow down pursuit, it is possible to turn the wrist parallel to the ground and fire off a couple of backward rounds without slowing down much at all. It is an advantage over the classic stance in this respect. But Mel doesn't use this technique for running away. He usually uses it running forward or sideways. Please Mr. Gibson, just drop it.<br /><br />Other than that, I loved the movie. The Mel-Man is doing what he does best, that is being his own bad self, cracking wise, getting into trouble, then against all odds, overcoming it, with aplomb and a certain street flair as well.<br /><br />The movie was originally titled \\"How I Spent My Summer Vacation.\\" Only changing later to \\"Get The Gringo.\\" There are three major roles and Mel takes on two of them, First, he is the protagonist, everything revolves around him, secondly, he stars as the narrator, relating some of the inner workings of his character. There is the minor issue of just who he is talking to. But there is a nice balance here, and the technique works. It allows the movie to move forward to do what it does, which is to be an action movie, and at the same time gives us the inside scoop on our \\"hero's\\" thoughts and motives. The third star of \\"Get The Gringo\\" after Mel Gibson's dual role is played by Kevin Hernandez. He is a very special kid in the Mexican penitentiary called \\"El Pueblito\\" meaning small town and village. In many ways the inmates run the show, and anything anyone could want is available at a price. Which is the way it is in Mexico and throughout Latin America. In many ways it's a loony tune system, but if your a rich organized crime figure, you live like a king.<br /><br />So the plot revolves around the kid. Mel Gibson in all his roles is never much more than half bad, so the cynical, hard boiled thief and criminal gets involved in doing the right thing. Meantime he is somehow managing to stay alive in a mix of corrupt Mexican Police, a corrupt American Consulate official, California gangsters that he has robbed, and a drug cartel that uses him, but is always on the verge of whacking him. It is all artfully managed. There is violence and torture, but hey, that's Mexico these days. The story wouldn't be real without it.<br /><br />. Suffice it to say, that while there are younger action stars out there, it's hard to imagine anyone pulling off this movie like Mel Gibson.<br />One more note; part of the authenticity of the movie comes from filming in Brownsville Texas and Veracruz Mexico and on location sites that many a film maker will now avoid.<br /><br />Don't look for it in theatres, you can rent the video, get streaming versions etc..e inner workings of his character. There is the minor issue of just who he is talking to. But there is a nice balance here, and the technique works. It allows the movie to move forward to do what it does, which is to be an action movie, and at the same time gives us the inside scoop on our \\"hero's\\" thoughts and motives. The third star of \\"Get The Gringo\\" after Mel Gibson's dual role is played by Kevin Hernandez. He is a very special kid in the Mexican penitentiary called \\"El Pueblito\\" meaning small town and village. In many ways the inmates run the show, and anything anyone could want is available at a price. Which is the way it is in Mexico and throughout Latin America. In many ways it's a loony tune system, but if your a rich organized crime figure, you live like a king.<br /><br />So the plot revolves around the kid. Mel Gibson in all his roles is never much more than half bad, so the cynical, hard boiled thief and criminal gets involved in doing the right thing.

B005LAII3A|3.0|I saw the Ahnuld version way back when, and liked it a lot. So I had some reservations when the remake came around 20+ years later. Some of them were well justified.<br /><br />The move from a lifeless Mars to a toxic Earth came across as political, whatever the truth in it. And no one can be Ahnuld except Ahnuld, lately the Governator. Details aside, the freshness was off it - it's been done.<br /><br />The good news is that every doing is a new doing. An interesting bit of real-world physics brightened for us nerdy types. (freefall through an evacuated tunnel through the earth - shades of college calculus!) The intimate entertainer with the tri-teat specialty benefitted from new makeup technology. Special effects were very special and effective. And, this had Kate Beckinsale. If you ever need a bad mama in charge of a catsuit and some covert urban warfare, hire her. (\\"I give good wife.\\" That line is destined to become a classic.) Even with Beckinsale in the cast, Jessica Biel could only improve things, and did.<br /><br />There was plenty to gripe about, if you're minded to gripe, but that's not what makes me happy. Popcorn-worthy SF, adventure, and catsuits do, so this is a winner in my book.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Perhaps one of the most profound documentaries of the past decade. Food Inc. truly opens a window into the precarious state of America's agricultural industries and the effects they and their political consequences have on Americans themselves. It can be hard to watch at times and even after seeing it several times, I still feel pangs of guilt when I watch it but is that so bad? It's a must watch for anyone who masticates, omnivore or otherwise.

B001EBWITA|5.0|I love this movie. I'm not a fan of the original graphic comics - - just never crossed my radar, not that I travel the right circles (sadly) -- so i am ordering a rebinding of the original series, set 1, today. I remember seeing this the first time and thinking, eh, it's ok. But I knew that was because some element touched something basic in me. But I watch it again and again over the years and love it more every time. Now--exactly today -- i would say, i'm an entrenched cult fan. My status as a KR fan completely aside (and undiscussed) is irrelevant. Although if this film had been made with the originally envisioned Nicholas Cage (who I will freely confess my belief to be a truly great actor) it would have had a completely different feel, tone, and I'm not sure I would have liked this combination. I absolutely adore Rachel Weisz without qualification. (KR's career has been attended by so much controversy I just abstain). I feel the chemistry is sufficient, sorry I can't say more, but again put this in context - I still absolutely love this movie for some indefinable subliminal (or sublime) factor I can't put into words. And the more times I watch it the more strongly I feel this way. I hope I enjoy the comic series, which I know is qualitatively somewhat different, but I've always enjoyed this type of comic or graphic novel. So I expect I will.

B008E374PO|4.0|Ever since I heard 'Ocean Eyes' I have been hooked on Adam Young and his creative musical work. I had no idea that there was a new album coming out this year, espcially since 'All Things Bright & Beautiful' was released just a year ago.<br /><br />'The Midsummer Station' is something very different from the previous Owl City albums. It seems that the soft synthesizer has given away to more up beat and sometimes harder sounds, which is not a bad thing. Teaming up with Carley Rae Jepsin and Blink 182s Mark Hoppus gives you two of the better songs on the album, but also songs like Shooting Star and Metropolis also highlight this record. The style is also very different, very much like the Europian Techno sound that is very popular in music right now. Still, there is one thing I am not so happy about and it's that the whimisical lyrics seem to have left to make room for a little more mainstreem typical lyrics. None of these songs have that same magic as Fireflies and The Yacht Club. However this album is not bad at all and I am very inrigued by this new and unexpected direction Owl City is taking. It is leaving me very interested in what lies ahead.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|The Fifty Shades trilogy has so much hype surrounding it. I had to see for myself what all the buzz was about...and I can't help it, I love me some Fifty Shades. I was totally addicted and couldn't put the books down. I plan to wait a few months and re-read all 3 books! More than the \\"Kinky F*****Y*\\" I love the intense bond between Christian and Anastasia...and their evolving relationship. It really is more than just the sex that makes this trilogy enjoyable and addictive, for me anyways.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this card game. You dont want to use a stylus with it because it puts cards where you dont want them, just use your finger and it works great.

B000UZNSWM|5.0|David Halberstam is one of my favorite authors, and this is among his finest work. He takes the reader through all the major campaigns of the Korean war, including the parts fought in Washington and Tokyo.<br /><br />---The Good Points---<br /><br />*Halberstam writes in an easy-to-read style, and is capable of making complex topics or events easily understandable by the reader.<br /><br />* The author does a nice job of relating the story of the Korean war on multiple levels. We spend time with the politics governments, the interpersonal relationships of MacArthurs headquarters, the campaigns at the division and corps level, and spend time with a platoon hunkered down in their foxholes on a lonely hillside.<br /><br />* I thought I understood the motivations and politics of the Korean (and later, the Vietnamese) war, but Halberstam explains the underlying causes in a way that I had never considered, and he makes a convincing case.<br /><br />* The motivations of the Peoples Republic in Korea make much more sense after reading this book. The relations between the USSR and Red China were complex, and it many ways it seems that Stalin got the better end of the deal.<br /><br />* Much of the Korean war involves some very poor leadership on the part of the US Army and Defense Department, and Halberstam does a nice job of being brutally honest, but not seeming to be out to do a hatchet job on anyone...well, almost anyone- see below.<br /><br />* The tales of individuals and small units are just incredible. The stories are brutal, raw, and do an excellent job of capturing the tales of the men fighting in Korea. The details of the Chosin Reservoir retreat are as horrifying and amazing tales of war I have ever read.<br /><br />---The Not So Good Stuff<br /><br />* If you are a fan of Douglas MacArthur, don't read the book. The General does not come across very well-in fact he comes across quite poorly. Halberstam makes a good case for his arguments, and history seems to be on his side. Still, it hurts to see a \\"hero\\" portrayed in such poor terms.<br /><br />* The book, at times, gets repetitive, with the same point made multiple times. The story also jumps around a bit, and at times I got a little impatient as we left the exciting combat narrative for a journey into politics.<br /><br />* The major characters seem to be one-dimensional. Generals come across as as either excellent or poor, with few shades of gray in between. Seems unlikely.<br /><br />* Amazon has got to get its act together with maps. Some of them were almost readable, but a good number were just fuzzy, out-of-focus green and black blurs. And since the maps show troop movements, it is not like you can look them up elsewhere.<br /><br />---Overall---<br /><br />The good stuff outweighs the bad by a large margin. The book is an excellent look at the causes, underlying strategies, winners and losers and events of the Korean War. It is a marvelous look at the geopolitics of the 50's, and by extension the 60's and 70's. We see some great men at their best, and worst, and get a chance to understand some of the 20th century's most perplexing wars with the benefit of hindsight.<br /><br />If you are at all a fan of 20th century history, this is well worth reading.on his side.

B003F5NSTW|3.0|I'm finding this book quite arduous to read. The fact that it's all written from the point of view of the mother (at the moment - does it change??)is making it quite boring. I just can't get into it. I have only read 17% of it, but I just can't keep on with it.
B007XNAQ6A|4.0|I have collected Duran Duran since their very first UK 7\\" / 12\\" single and to this day collect up their music. I saw this coming out and thought it had a good track listing (The DVD is more complete though). I was impressed,it is excellent, I have some of this tour on bootlegs but the sound is far better on this then any of those recordings. I must note that one guy reviewing here said the sound was bad! You best check your equipment buddy because it sounds great from speakers or headphones. I am not a great fan of \\"Live\\" albums but this one is better then most. If you have a chance to see this band, check them out. It is worth the experience. As for this album, get it, good listening album. One word though,the DVD version is even better.<br />Drop by my website sometime for a visit @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\".
B005HSL626|5.0|this is a super fun game.  helps relieve some work stress. had no problems installing and I really never even noticed the ads.
B007XNAQPG|5.0|I reviewed the audio album, now the DVD release. This is even better then the audio version for the sound and the extra songs which never made the cut for the CD. I highly recommend this for Duran Duran fans who have been following them from the beginning & for the new generation of music listeners. My favorites performed on it are \\"Planet Earth\\", Careless /memories\\", A View To A Kill\\" & \\"Rio\\". A interesting number is when they do \\"Wild Boys\\" and mix in Frankie Goes To Hollywood's \\"Relax\\" in the song. The bonus material features a documentary / interviews & bonus tracks \\"Come Undone\\" (my wife's favorite DD song) & \\"Is There Someone I Should Know\\". I highly recommend this one & is very entertaining. So get this over the audio CD unless you collect, like myself & get both!.<br />Drop by my website sometime for a visit @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\".
B005HSL626|3.0|I have a Kindlefire...I thought about this app and read most of the reviews and I got it :) . I was perfectly fine and then on my 7 or 8th game it just started to close out on me and took me to my menu screen. I really like this game though... -_-
B0000584V3|5.0|About a year ago, I felt the need to break beyond the boundaries of progressive rock. I grew up on Pink Floyd, Rush, and Yes, but frankly, I felt there was something missing in my mp3 collection. So I discovered Opeth after browsing band names at progarchives.com, near the top of the page. I clicked on the link for Opeth, and after listening to a couple of their songs on Youtube, I cringed. I just couldn't get past the death vox.<br /><br />A month afterward, I spoke with a friend about the bands that I had recently discovered like Symphony X and Opeth, and he practically jumped out of his seat when I mentioned Opeth. He proceeded to send me a few of their albums. Ghost Reveries, Still Life, and Blackwater Park. The two songs that I kept playing were Benighted Atonement. And realizing how great these songs were, I decided to force myself to get past Mikael Akerfeldt's death vox. And now, I can't get enough.<br /><br />For me, Blackwater Park is the album that filled the musical void in my life and made me a fan of progressive death metal. It's dark, brooding, and has the hard edge that I've been missing in my music. When I introduce someone to Opeth, the usual reply is \\"Great musicianship, but why does he have to growl?\\" My response is, \\"No other vocal style would fit. Get over it or die unhappy.\\"<br /><br />From the beginning to end, Blackwater Park is filled with wicked beauty. I can't pick any one song that is my favorite because each song has its own power and lure.<br /><br />Before I discovered Opeth, my wife grew tired of me listening to Rush all the time. Now she wishes I would just go back to Rush. If you're like I was, looking for darker music to fill the void in your life, I strongly recommend you start with Blackwater Park.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I loved the book.. But a waste of money buying it at Amazon the only thing I didn't like about it was.. I bought it to put on my e-book reader to read while at lunch at work.( which is compatible with all e-book formats) only to find out that it wouldn't open on the reader( I tried contacting Amazon about this issue and never got response to my problem) and if I wanted to read it on an e-book reader I would have to purchase an Amazon Kindle. So I bought the book from Barnes and Noble only to find the same issue was with their books as well. I ended up having to go down to the library and check it on for e-book readers. IN my opinion don't waste your money buying the e-book from amazon or Barnes and noble unless you own a kindle or nook just go to the library and check it out. They have it in a variety of formats and works seamlessly with all e-book readers and can be gotten just as fast on your computer all you need is your library card.<br />Otherwise the book is great.. definitely read it.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|It'd be deceitful to really claim this film was a book adaptation.  I mean yes it has the same title and yes Abraham Lincoln does indeed kill vampires, but that's not really what the book was about.<br /><br />The key feature of the novel, what caused it to receive so much acclaim, was not the vampires but that it was so well grounded in the historical data we already know about Lincoln.  So well done in fact that, if one were to entertain the existence of vampires, it could have easily been a feasible account of what happened.  Like a conspiracy that was hidden from us all these years<br /><br />To the films credit it tries to retain the overall serious tone of the book, but is filled with so many awkward historical inaccuracies the audience can't help but laugh.  The cinematography is well shot and pleasing to the eye, but not enough to distract you from the abysmal plot and horrible acting.  It's a fine example of Hollywood's tendency to be melodramatic and over the top, but even if you're looking for a \\"so bad it's funny\\" film I suggest you look elsewhere<br /><br />I hope in 20 years or so some producer is brave enough to do a remake, I'd honestly like to see this film done right.

0439023513|2.0|I love book 1 and 2, but this....I shouldn't of read it, but it's part of a trilogy and I had to know what happens.  I don't think I'll ever be able to reread just books 1 and 2 on their own, without thinking about what happens in 3!  It left me feeling a bit sad!

B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was good, the flow of the movie was also good. I have heard that it was a little off from the book but most movies that were books are. It had a good storyline and the charaters played good parts. The little girl, rue, should of been more of a part in the movie, she was just a backround image and she should of played more of a part.<br /><br />Over all it was a good movie
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie is very good, action packed and shows a different take on aliens<br />i liked the different look the aliens have also, great special effects
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I love this show! It's based on a story by Stephen King called the Colorado kid. The characters are interesting and 'troubles' they investigate are clever and interesting. I had looked to buy it at several different places, so thank you Amazon for your user friendly ways.

1609611543|5.0|I went Wheat Belly 2.5 months ago and the results are amazing.  I am so delighted by my results I am preaching it to anyone who asks.  Hallelujah!  Some women at work have started eating this way too.  Then again, some people look at me as thought I have joined a cult.<br /><br />Diet changes:  I added coconut oil, meats, low carb veggies, flax seed and removed all grains, beer, rice, sugars, and higher carb veggies.  Also supplement with cod liver oil and vitamin D with K2<br /><br />Results:  Lost 26 pounds, lost appetite in three days so now I eat for nutrition, lost dry patches on my elbows, patch on face dermatologist looked at healed itself, knees only ache a little and can get up from floor with ease, a 30 year goiter almost disappeared, feel better and have more energy than I have had for years!<br /><br />With all of the positive results aside from weight loss, this is not just a diet but a new way of eating.  There is no going back.<br /><br />To be honest, I decided to give up wheat and sugar a couple weeks before I found the book. (Thank you Bill O'Reilly).  Found \\"Wheat Belly\\" on Facebook first and the stories and support there are amazing.  Dr. Davis is so nice and chimes in with support and advice.  The book explains why wheat is the devil and how many conditions can be helped by eating this way.<br /><br />I would like to convert all of my friends to the Wheat Belly way, especially those challenged with excess weight, diabetes, allergies and pain.  My prayer is you give it a try, and go all in.

B0012CH350|5.0|I am totally satisfied with the Weber 7452 Premium Kettle Cover I purchased for my 18-1/2- inch Weber grill.  It appears sturdy and well-made, was very easy to put over the grill and is long enough to reach over the tops of the wheels.  I wanted a simple, sturdy, inexpensive cover for the grill, which has to remain unsheltered for the outdoor cooking season and this fills the bill.
B009329Y30|4.0|Maybe people should stop being critics and just say what they liked about the movie, Maybe They were not in the right Mood, I Totally Enjoyed the movie, I Think you might have to be stress free before you watch the movie, If your to wound up you might not enjoy it. Acting was good, But I guess you have to Immerse yourself the the story to see it the way I did. Excellent!!

In the barn, I had spiders all over me, in my pants, in my nose, and other places Amazon doesn't want me mentioning. Now I can't play spider games, but at least I am a conservative!
B008VBYN80|4.0|Just got the game and having fun with it.  Can't wait till I've built up my lands.  My son has been watching over my shoulder amazed.
0393339882|5.0|This is a great book to help answer the question of what is the nature of reality. It has inspired a great number of new ideas in my own mind. In the debate I side with the loser, Albert Einstein, and believe that cause and effect are present even on the sub-atomic level.
B0012PDVQ2|2.0|Given that this was the final cut, I would hate to see previous cuts. I was hoping for deep sci-fi but it was basically a bad action movie.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|This is a well-made low budget virus movie which looks and feels like a much larger budget film. Chris Pine (destined for great things in Star Trek) does a sound job in the lead role with an excellent supporting cast.<br /><br />Suprisingly well filmed, the script & story are solid. We witness the journey of 4 survivors across the US heading towards an almost mythical beach location. Everywhere they find the dead & the desperate. The journey brings some hard decisions & one strength of the film is that the characters refuse to fall into the classic good or bad category. As things get desperate, the thin line disappears.....what's right & wrong anyway when the world is dying..<br /><br />I can't understand some of the very negative reviews here. This is a solid post-apoc film. It's not going to win any prizes but it's a realistic & gritty portrayal of the 'end times'.<br /><br />Expect few special effects apart from grisly corpses...this is more of a sci-fi/viral horror than a slasher or zombie flick.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it & think it deserves better recognition.
B002ZG99QS|2.0|Overall not as good as I hoped. And the only reason I made it through was because there was nothing better to watch.<br />The story picks up hooking the first movie, and introducing us to Jack's (Jeff Bridges) son, who has grown up without a dad, and has become a rebellious youth.<br />The visual effects were fantastic. The story was incredibly lacking in plot, characters, and theme development.  It wasn't believable .  I wasn't drawn in.  I wasn't hooked.<br />The original was a lot better, in the story, characters, and theme.<br />I would not buy this for my collection.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Batman is awesome and cool when fighting Bane and his men. In my opinion, TDKR is the best superhero game on the planet!!!
B004LWZW7E|3.0|Overall a very intriguing idea that fell somewhat flat on story and character foundation delivery.<br />The story follows an ordinary guy, living in a world where time is bought, sold, and stolen instead of money.  Time has become the means of commerce in this alternate world.<br />The theme was great, but the story and the characters needed a lot more work. I was more interested in the theme than I was in the characters.  Not a good sign.<br />I would not buy this for collection
B00000JPH6|1.0|I finally saw the Dark Crystal with my son after I'd heard of it from my youth, but never saw it.  The technology was interesting and supposedly ground-breaking for the day, in animatronics and puppetry, but aside from that, it's all downhill.  The story was simplistic and uninspired.  The characters aren't developed much, the scripting is dull and the presentation is so, so slow.  My son couldn't relate to the narrative factor, asking mainly \\"when are the characters going to actually talk?\\"  I was bored to sleep, literally on several occasions during the movie, and by the time it ended, I was relieved that the whole event was finally over.  My wife's one comment after sitting through the movie was \\"well, that was just horrid.\\"  So, what in the heck do the other reviewers see in this clunker?  It's a mystery to me and I have to feel that it's a lot of Jim Hensen is a genius-like feelings without actually taking an honest look at what the end-product really is.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is designed to be the game that is just a guy running from the evil skull monkeys with the idol. All you're doing is running, and I love it. I've never experienced lag on my kindle fire and feel this is definitely a worthy game for the price of FREE!!!
B007SWZVBQ|4.0|I usually buy all the Glee albums because I am such the gleek even at age 52. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect from a graduation themed album and wondered if I could relate. The answer is a resounding gleeful YES. There was enough nostalgia there to satisfy and entertain and enough new song material to make it interesting on a creative level. Kudos to all involved.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this is the best app ever you can download music and videos i love it specially when i dont have any wi-fi please go try it -monet- &hearts;
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love this game. It is very easy to play. The challenge is in trying to get the matches before the one minute deadline. Lots of fun.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love Pinterest and was so happy when I saw the app available. one of the major issues I have had is upon opening the app it hangs for a number of minutes and the asks to force close or wait. I have to close and reopen in order for it to work properly.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|One of the best puzzle games that I have played that challenges the brain. Would highly recommend this if you like brain teasers!
1410430103|1.0|Will admit up front that I really wanted to like this book. Jack Reacher is a no nonsense sorta guy who leaves a trail of bodies behind him. As others have pointed out, there are so many logical absurdities that you want to toss the book out the window. However, I slogged through figuring it had to get better. Sorry, but it gets worse. The Sunday \\"deadline\\" that permeates the novel is beyond absurd but is surpassed by the ending. Here is a little town that is suddenly crawling with local, state and federal agencies, to say nothing of the press, and Jack, figuring they might want to detain him for questioning (he has personally killed a lot of people including the town's mayor and the leading philanthropist so, yeah Jack, they might want a word with you), changes his clothes and hops a bus to California. Hey, no way the long arm of the law will be able to get me now!
B004UXUUDA|5.0|What an incredible movie!  While the plot is far remove from reality (with the exception of the Jewish round-up) and the cold ugly truth of those dark days, this movie was very moving and superbly acted.  I still cannot wrap my head around this horrific tragedy and it makes me sick to know that the round-up in France was done by the French not necessarily  by the Germans. The scene where Sarah comes back to Paris is heartbreaking and  the only thing I wish I could have seen more was Sarah's story after the war, other then that it's a great movie.
B009329ZF2|4.0|This time I watched it on my On Demand cable and I must say it was a fun movie. There was action, space dudes, pretty girl, Liam Neeson and Alexander Skarsgård (Eric from True Blood; love that show) even Rihanna did okay. The acting was middle of the road not great not horrible and sometime just bad, but I mainly watched it for all the crazy action. You'll enjoy it if you like CG, SiFi and american heroes fighting the good fight
B008S4YZCO|5.0|this game is good so far extremely. fun but they try to bribe you at round Lvov 5 for a five star review total crap
B005LAIHPE|5.0|While this movie does not portray events in a probable manner, the action is non-stop and is full of bang and fury.  I do not mean to include spoilers but the veterans involved in this film do an excellent job and the movie waxes patriotism at all levels.  The smaller Allied warships get chewed up pretty badly but when Big Mo comes in...well..I'll just say things turn around.  This movie might be dumb to certain reviewers but the suspension of disbelief in this movie is quite acceptable.  I love this movie, it's cast, and portrayal of the United States Navy under extreme circumstances.
1609611543|5.0|Thought this book was very interesting, informative - and humorous. I read 'Dangerous Grains' first - it seems a little less technical. These books changed my life. I feel so much better, sleep 7-8 hours at night (hadn't slept well in years, was tired all the time) and off some meds (one for acid reflux). I thought I was pretty healthy before! Not!
B008IYR2BA|4.0|Dexter is one of my favorite shows of all time.  I really enjoyed this season. Not my favorite but still excellent. The last 30 seconds of the last episode is a nail biter. I want more!
B005IEF27O|5.0|Buy it now...This Album is THE shit!!! You will regret having waited as long as you did.<br />Brings back memories of the old days without sounding old.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|\\"Flowers for Algernon\\" began as a short story in Fantasy & Science Fiction Magazine. I still have my yellowing copy from when I was a teen. From there it became a novel, a movie and a stage play, retaining the impact of the basic story in all forms. I can't recommend this book too highly; it is, and has long been, one of my very favorites. Others have given you the plot line so there is no point in repeating. I'll just tell you the insights you gain into your own life, your own intelligence and your empathy will be well worth your time.
B008MEM24S|4.0|this game is just as fun as where's my water, and just as addiciting and awesome :) ive played for about almost 2 hours now. gotta love it :)
B0086700CM|1.0|this game STINKS! at first the game was mediocre and I was entertained for about 5 minutes.....then it started to lag....then, the glitches got out of control. this game is over-rated. I HIGHLY recommend not getting this app for kindle fire.
0743270754|5.0|\\"Blessed are the Peace-Makers' ...<br /><br />This is a story of Lincoln adding his most brilliant 'competition' to his administration. When he achieves this grouping, he assures the country of the 'greatest wisdom' to help him guide the nation. The cast are all familiar names but many did not know the lack of allegiance they held for oneanother -- until they join to save the nation and heal the wounds.<br /><br />The book is a powerful read and one you won't be quickly putting down at the end of the evening. Get a copy - you will never regret learning this American saga -- as composed by this fine author.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. its fun and I can waste time on this app, but the only problem is you have to buy the games with money you get in the game, and it takes a long time to get money. I would suggest it to my friends though!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Love all the Angry Birds games.  Just when you think you will never win the round you win it.  Occupies me for hours
B0010YPTGU|5.0|This DVD is perfect. The concert, location, music, and video quality are all first-rate. Incredible concert by an incredible singer!<br /><br />I would have loved to see and hear a duet by Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion. But no Celine this time. They both have such beautiful, natural, and sincere voices that go well together.
B007SNFTAI|2.0|I am finding it to be a real labor to read. I lose interest after about a page and a half and put it down. To me it is a very slow moving story and I just can't seem to finish the book.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I love Evanescence, through my depression they've helped me a lot, in this DVD you get to see Evanescence behind the scenes, It's a kick. You should get it, It's perfect. You won't be disappointed
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I caught an interview with Rachel Joyce on the Diane Rehm show driving home one day and I downloaded the novel to see what it was all about. I found it a very enjoyable read, which is rare for me as I generally prefer the classics and plays to current fiction. The book is built around the idea that we get in our daily routines and bury our memories and we can lose our ability to chart a happy course for our lives. In this case, a once happy marriage has completely deteriorated. And in our technology and automobile obsessed culture, what would happen if we took a walk without a mobile and without a car? Well, what happens here is that Harold's memories start to come back and though he is walking ostensibly to right a wrong from his past, the overriding memories are happy memories from his early marriage, which have been repressed by subsequent events. Besides being a good read, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, is actually a mediation on why we do the things we do and shows how Harold charts a pathway back to that which is important in his life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Well, except for the ads, but they're easy to get by. It's one of the best versions of solitaire I've played in a while.
B002BRRTUO|4.0|This is one of those favorites that you're not completely sure why you love it, but I do. It's just a fun movie and I watch it occasionally.
B005LAII12|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.The language might have been a bit raunchy.But,I guess it had to be as it was to portray the mood of the movie.I plan on getting this movie.A good laugh,and a few touching moments,Especially,at the end.This teddy bear is not G rated.So,keep the young kids away.Other than that.Great!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator on my Kindle Fire: it's big enough to see without having to hold it and very easy to use.  I love to use it for balancing my checkbook.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|intuitive game play and surprisingly fun game given that you play the same level over and over again. I liked the challenges, but once I finished them all l lost interest in continuing to play the game.  in conclude: a fun game while the challenges last. worth the money.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love this product. I use it a ton to make to do lists, jot down random thoughts, take pictures of receipts that I want to save, etc! versatile and User friendly.
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|the concept for this game is simple: &quot;cut&quot; pieces of web to prevent the spiders from getting to the insects.  cute, but didn't capture my interest or imagination. seemed to load well and play without any hitches.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game rocks!the music is amazing the graphics are really good to.ignore any 1-4 review this game is definetly a 5 star game!the game does progress a little bit fast but u get the hang of it after like 2 games.the gadets and upgrades are amazing to.its not one of those games where the desiners just thought of a cheep idea,rushed theough the whole making,and ended up w/ a whole big pile of garbage.this game i thought was thout well through and done quite nicely.i play this all the time.my mom and dad have to sometimes take my kindle fire away just to get me to do something else!another thing,there arent any add pop ups and no lagging whatsoever!wich for u picky ppl our there,is a good thing.very good,state of the art game that has me captivated for hours on end :) great game for a free game.gives a new meaning of \\"the best game on earth\\"and honestly,this is the best game on earth! HALFBRICK HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game so much it is the best game ever try this game what you do is somebody draws something you try to guess it if you cant guess it than you click pass
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This is a pretty decent free version. I would only change the music. I prefer to play in silence and so far I can't find a way to turn it off.
B008XG1X18|5.0|the only thing is the random people I end up following...please make it easier to unfollow! I have learner so much from this App
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I typically can't handle seeing war or military movies at theaters, as I tend to get too emotional.  I decided to wait until it was available for DVD and watch it at home.  I would have given a standing ovation if saw it at the theater.  This movie was not as much Hollywood, and I saw it almost as a documentary.  And I was able to handle the violence.  Knowing it involved real Navy Seals and seeing how they risk their lives to rescue or protect us from terrorism allows you to look beyond the acting and see how much they sacrifice themselves.  EVERY adult should watch this movie at least once. Proud to be an American!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game, it's great!  The graphics are pretty good for a free game. I would definitely recommend Temple Run to my friends and family.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|Been a while since I built my own unit.  This case was great.  Yeah, it would have been nice if the buttons were covered to prevent my 1 year old from turning off the unit but there are ways around that.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I sadly purchased all three books in Fifty Shades of Grey.  Not only are they badly constructed and written, but suffer from so much repetition and boredom that the  author cannot be proud of her work.  These books, which are on the supermarket shelves have only sold due to the huge marketing campaign, and if it was not for the explicit sexual escapades described with such boring  repetition, the writer is almost child like in her very light weight story.  It just shows the power of advertising, and anyone with a literary bone in their body would start their next open fire with these copies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love all the wonderful ideas and sharing my ideas with others. Wealth of information all in one site. Try it you too will love it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Only one ad per game, and it works very well.  I'd  pay a buck to have an ad-free version, but I haven't found one yet.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is such a great show.  It is so exciting - reminds me a little of how exciting the show 24 was in the early years.  There are enough reviews that tell you basic plot so I won't bother.  But the twists & turns that keep coming are indescribable anyway.  I watched season 1 in its entirety on TV, but had to buy the dvd set to show my family.  During the season, I would try to tell them about the show without giving too much away - he's good, he's bad, he's good, he's bad - she's right, she's crazy, she's right, she's crazy.  I love a show that leaves you guessing!  I can't wait for season 2!
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I have read and studied Beowulf in the original Old English for 25 years now, and have composed my own Old English poem that was then featured on the web site of a professor of that literary genre.  I have often tried to imagine a modern treatment of that legend that I would consider faithful to the spirit of the original.  This is an especially difficult task for a movie, which is necessarily more tightly constrained than the written or recited word.<br /><br />Those responsible for this movie have departed from a literal interpretation, but in doing so have formulated a plot that is credible within the context of the modern world.  The hero, Kainan, is indeed a being with otherworldly capabilities, but because he is a space traveller who has crash landed in Dark Age Scandinavia.  He must contend with a dragon-like monster that has followed him to Earth--and which threatens his newly adopted viking community.<br /><br />Jim Caviezel is convincing as the Beowulf-like alien Kainan.  After all, this is the not the first messianic figure he has successfully portrayed!  As in the original Beowulf saga, the viking king is named Hrothgar; his daughter is named Freya (analogous to Freawaru in Beowulf).  Unferth is once again the name of the warrior who is the rival of Kainan/Beowulf.<br /><br />To the inhabitants of this viking world, Kainen seemed sent by the gods.  It has been said that science passes for magic in the eyes of the uninitiated.  The writers make good use of this concept and created the best of all film adaptations of the Beowulf legend by far!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I found myself skipping pages of boring writing.  It was not an interesting read, I cannot tell you how many times the phrase; \\" She looked up at him through her lashes\\", appears in the books.  I trudged through the first book thinking it might get better. It didn't. The second was even worse. I couldn't finish it. Horribly written. It's supposed to be kinky. It's not. It's a ridiculous fantasy world, with the typical bland female that everyone finds desirable. I would not recommend these books to anyone. Absolutely awful.
0425263908|2.0|I read this after 50 Shades and that was probably a big mistake.  Not that 50 is a great work of erotic literature...it was still leaps and bounds better than this book.  I have read Sylvia Day before and liked her historical romance novels.  I should've known that this like her previous modern novels would be less satisfying.  I feel like someone who jumps on the vampire bandwagon after reading Twilight.  There are writers doing modern erotica better!  I just have to find them and not be swayed by what the bookstores say should be my next book.<br /><br />Specifically I didn't like the quick pace of the book, the characters seemed like caricatures of real people and I didn't feel connected to them at all.  There was too much sex and nothing near passion or love.  The plot device of abuse seemed overused, the main 3 characters were abused?  Way too much of that used in place of character development.  I am definitely on the wrong track. But the OCD in me will make me read the next one anyway...I hope that it's worth my time.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|well really dont know wtf you people are talking about?.. i ordered mine and it came in one day... pretty fast if you ask me... and  wtf are yall smelling it for??? well i smelled mine to and it smells like something knew... who would have thought??? o and my kindle fits in it.... all in all i got what i paid for... so yeah bye
B003TNQEF0|1.0|Poor, poor, poor.<br /><br />Poor acting<br />Poor story line<br />Poor ending<br />One of my sons recommended it, the other one was incredulous that he had.  Watched it end to end, hoping for improvement.  It never happened.
B008JAGZDE|1.0|It was a waste of time for them to make this movie. I loved the first 3, but this one wasn't funny or any good at all.
B005LAJ17M|1.0|After Homeland won six Emmy's, I felt that I needed to write a new review. I have no idea how this show got any awards or acclaim. It is bad. This is a Showtime drama, but it is produced by Fox 21, a studio known for rehashing shows over and over again, complete with fluff and diluted episodes. This is just a bad show. I stopped watching after the free pilot episode came out last year, but bought the Blu-Ray in the hopes that the show would be better uncensored and complete. The first few episodes were actually decent, but over time, Claire Danes just got to me. She is a grating, annoying actress. She is not very convincing as a CIA analyst at all. She would never get hired as one, I'm sorry. She is just not a very appealing leading woman for a show. Damien Lewis is the most generic, boring actor I've ever seen. I don't hate him, yet I don't think he's a great actor either. He never will be. It's as simple as that. He is someone that should come cheap, as an actor. For this line of work, an actor needs to stand out; he just can't.<br /><br />I watched until episode 8 or 9, then just gave up. After watching some truly bizarre, random, filler episodes, and seeing ridiculous twists that I swear I predicted around the first or second episode, I turned off. The show just kept getting worse. This is a great show for kids or people that don't watch much TV or get out much. If you are not any of those, skip the show. It's ludicrous. I mean, the main character is away from his wife for 8 years, presumed dead, returns to his wife and doesn't ever broach the notion of whether she saw anyone else, why she didn't remarry and whether she even wants or can be with him anymore. It felt like he just returned from a day of work. Really bad writing. His wife is a lousy actress, chosen more for her striking looks than realism.<br /><br />I hope a lot more people stop taking the Emmy's seriously after trying Homeland out. The Emmy's totally ignored The Wire and Oz for years, for cryingout loud. I'll give you three guesses as to what both shows had in common. For Homeland to get numerous acclaim, and for The Wire and Oz to not, raises serious questions. Skip this show, and thank me later.

B006VA57CY|5.0|THIS IS A WONDERFUL RENDITION OF WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE TO BE LIVING DURING WW1 - AMAZING ABOUT THE CLASS DIFFERENCES AND JUST HOW FAR WE HAVE COME FROM THAT AND THEN AGAIN.... HOW FAR WE HAVE NOT... SO ENTITLED
B007L3BMGA|5.0|5 stars because it was such an easy, addictive and enjoyable read! I bought the book having no idea what all the fuss was about and was curious. I was a little taken back at first as it was my first romance/erotic novel, but quickly knew that I would not be able to put it down. If you are reading this and are deciding wether or not to buy it, go for it! You will love it I'm sure.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Lots of translations, great interface.<br />I like the fact that you can download translations for when you're not online. I use it often.
B00866H7SS|5.0|This was my next stop after Fifty Shades. I was really hoping that it was a similar read, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's very similar, perhaps slightly more graphic?? Looking forward to the next book.....hmmm, what to read next??
1451683405|1.0|Poor Sam. Running out of ideas. Could only write 96 pages. He adds very little to the dialogue that Humes or Edwards haven't covered 100+ years ago. I learned more from Rob Brezsny than I did from this book. Both he and Hitchens are great at turning a phrase, but that's the beginning and end of it. If you boil down what they say to its essence, not much new to be found. Aside: What do people do with their \\"free will\\" anyway--watch to see how big Kim's a$$ has gotten? If he and his ilk really cared about civilization, they'd turn their attention elsewhere and start dissecting the entertainment industry, the real opiate of the people. But, oops, don't bite the hand that feeds....
B005K17RU0|4.0|great and useful APP. I like it better than weather channel because it is easier to use and looks nicer.
B005URRCUY|4.0|If you like rock and roll in the classic sense, this is the band for you.  It sure is one for me.  It has a fresh feel and lively spirit, but keeps a firm grasp on it's r-n-r roots.  It kept up with some of my other recent purchases such as[[ASIN:B004NDVJUU Old Tyme Religion]]and[[ASIN:B0000264ZP Greatest Hits]].  This is a band I will be coming back to again and again.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  They say the majority of people didn't like it but I thought it was wonderful.  Chazz Palminteri stars in the film as mentor to Robert De Niro's son, C.  I thought Palminteri did a great job in the role of Sonny.  I'm used to seeing De Niro in a more mafia in charge role so this was better as he was a father looking after his son.  I would highly recommend this film.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Loved it on my pc. Works on my Kindle fire just fine. Only problem for me is squares are a little small.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love that it has so many different games to choose from, so you don't get bored playing the same game over and over again.
B008M36ER0|5.0|Hello!  This is a real Mel Gibson movie, as good as \\"Payback\\" and \\"Lethal Weapon\\".  This is definitely worth renting and/or buying.
B0082LUEW8|5.0|To set the stage, I am one of Mudvayne's biggest fans, and I have been a faithful supporter of Pantera since 1992. When Chad Gray and Greg Tribbett from Mudvayne teamed up with Vinnie Paul, I eagerly anticipated the self-titled debut album of Hellyeah. Sadly, I found myself disappointed. I was expecting the same kind of lyrics Chad had been giving us since 2000, and I was hoping for the same complicated off-beats and hard-core metal I deeply admired from both Tribbett and Paul. The album, IMO, did not deliver. The band's follow up release, \\"Stampede\\", was an even bigger disappointment. It was so mediocre that I listened to some samples online and never bothered to buy the album.<br /><br />When I saw that \\"Band of Brothers\\" was going to be released, I shrugged it off with a 'who cares', and didn't look back. It wasn't until I read that the album took \\"Best Rock Album of the Summer\\" on Loudwire that I meandered my way over to youtube and listened to the first few tracks.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"War in Me\\", which is probably on par with the strongest singles from their debut release. Pretty good, but not the best stuff I've ever heard. However, the album kicks into overdrive with \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"Rage/Burn\\", and it never really looks back. This album sounds NOTHING like their previous releases. It sounds more like \\"The End of All Things to Come\\" meets \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", and believe me, that is a good thing. Now, let's be honest. This is NOT \\"The End of All Things to Come\\" or \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\". Those two albums are icons and can never be replicated. However, it's a fun listen with some great riffs, excellent beats, and while the lyrics may not be as intrusive as some of the stuff Chad did with the VaYnE, they're not as sophomoric as the lyrics on the first two Hellyeah albums.<br /><br />I'm giving this album five stars because I honestly believe this is one of the better metal albums I've heard in the past several years.

B008M34INW|5.0|Love Mel Gibson- let's get that straight right up front. Love the guy. Can't even begin to describe the plot without spoiling it, but suffice to say it was entertaining, original, and fun to watch. I think it would have done well in the theater, but who am I to say. Interesting characters and Mel is his usual bad self.

B005LAJ23A|4.0|Blu-ray review:<br /><br />Spoilers:<br /><br />During the second season of \\"The Walking Dead\\" our survivors became the walking wounded as they tried to regroup after losing members. After an attack by zombies on a deserted highway Sophia goes missing. Rick (Andrew Lincoln) feels guilty about this and the group spends time looking for her through half of the season discovering a refuge at the farm owned by Herscel a former vet who helps save Rick's son Carl.<br /><br />End of Spoilers:<br /><br />The second season also found the new showrunner Glen Mazzara and his writers struggled with the loss of Frank Darabont but quickly found their footing even as they dealt with budget cuts. The second season sagged a bit during the middle of the season but, on the whole, there was superior character development.<br /><br />Luckily even when the material is a bit sketchy, the actors do their best with the material and always make the show watchable particularly Jon Bernthal as Shane who continues to play the most morally complex character on the show(comparable only to Bryan Cranston's performance as Walt on [[ASIN:B001DJLCRC Breaking Bad: The Complete First Season]]). At its best \\"The Walking Dead\\" compares to \\"Breaking Bad\\" and the best shows on TV.<br /><br />\\"The Walking Dead\\" is shot Super 16mm film. The grainy, coarse presentation on Blu-ray (and the DVD)is intentional--you'll notice it's far grittier looking than AMC's presentation but you'll also notice greater depth, clarity and detail in the Blu-ray presentation. Night scenes particularly benefit from the high def presentation here. Whether or not you'll enjoy the presentation is based on what your expectations of the look of the show should be in high def.<br /><br />The lossless presentation sounds marvelous with a nice, active soundstage. Dialogue is clear throughout.<br /><br />The special features include the 13 minutes that were cut from the revised second season premiere. These scenes along with the rest of the deleted scenes include commentary from wrtier/producer/showrunner Glen Mazzara discussing the reasons why he felt the scenes didn't work and why they were cut. Those 13 minutes make for a fascinating alternate opening for the second season opener. It's a pity that they eliminated the stand-alone epiosde that Darabont planned which would have told us about the man in the tank from season one (much like the webisodes that told us about bicycle girl from the first season--the first zombie that Rick encountered after leaving the hospital that was half eaten and yet still alive. I'd love to see more of these). Working with those budget cuts did impact the quality of the season as well as the narrative making the second season more static than the first.<br /><br />We also get five commentary tracks including Mazzara with a different combination of writers/directors (and with actress Lauren Holden as well). They are pretty informative about the decisions they made in shooting the second season the way they did as well as script decisions.<br /><br />We get a number of featurettes: \\"All The Guts Inside\\", \\"Live or Let Die\\", \\"The Meat of the Music\\", \\"Fire on Set\\", \\"The Ink is Alive\\", \\"The Sound of Effects\\", \\"In The Dead of Water\\", \\"You Could Make A Killing\\",\\"She Will Fight\\", \\"Extras Wardrobe\\" and \\"The Cast Of Season Two\\" focuses on everything from make up effects, the music score, the sound effects, the change of the character of Andrea over the course of the second season and the cast discussing the challenges of the second season.<br /><br />Unlike the original first season set, this set comes packed with special features. The transfer looks gritty and coarse but that's how it is supposed to look. Character development is truly the star for the second season of \\"The Walking Dead\\".<br /><br />Recommended.e deleted scenes include commentary from wrtier/producer/showrunner Glen Mazzara discussing the reasons why he felt the scenes didn't work and why they were cut.

The peripheral characters were interesting, (sometimes more interesting than the main character) and even though the story seemed a little slow at times, it always picked up enough to keep me going, and the end made it all worth it. I look forward to seeing what happens next.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Fantastic! At first I wasn't sure if I would like the style (jumping from many, many different stories and perspectives rather than sticking with one), but I loved it. That style gave you a massive diversity of oral accounts from the war and it was always exciting to see where Brooks would take you next.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is not rocket science. you just tap the screen, but overall, enjoyable. some games are much easier than others which may cause some frustration.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed how the author incorporated the unusual vintage photographs into his story. Several of the photographs had an eerie other-worldly feel to them, and added nicely to the mysterious atmosphere of the book. I felt the ending was a little bit of a let down after a compelling build up. Perhaps the author is planning a sequel, which would explain the inconclusive ending. It left me unsatisfied, but over all it was an interesting read.

Like many others, I think the first three books were some of the best fantasy books ever written. They held my interest like few others, took directions many other writers would not dare to take and had me itching to read the next. I'm a fan who checked on the status of this book at least a couple dozen times through each year to see how the progress was coming and I'm a fan who also believes in a writer taking the time he or she needs to do it properly.

Sometimes I can see right away what pipe should go where and other times I try so many times I get convinced that the level is impossible.  Then a few hours or days later I might try again and all of a sudden get it.  I believe that playing games like this helps keep your mind sharp which should help 50 years from now when my future children try to stick me in a nursing home.
B00006JOQ3|5.0|I do a lot reviews for metal albums, movies and lately some less metal music (Lita Ford, Pat Benatar) -and though hard and heavy, this is NOT metal. This album got a raw deal in the 80's.  John Sykes, as some of you who may be in the know, was the guitarist (amongst other bands) who basically put together the entire self-titled \\"Whitesnake\\" album.  He played all the guitars (save for one solo, courtesy of Adrian Vandenberg) -along with Aynsley Dunbar & Neil Murray, he MADE that album sound the way it did... and got almost no credit for it.<br /><br />So Geffen gave Sykes a shot at recording an album since he was let go from Whitesnake, and he gathered (after recording a demo with a different line up) Carmine Appice and Tony Franklin on drums and bass respectively (Nik Green handled keyboard duties) -to record this master work. The production was handled by none other than Bob \\"I killed Metallica, but hey I made' em popular\\" Rock.<br /><br />Now, everyone back in the 80's commented on how guitar heavy the Whitesnake album was -and here's the reason why: John Sykes. His tone on this album is very similar, you can tell it's him playing on both albums. This (the Blue Murder) album is repleat with heavy guitar riffing out the whazoo, and the solos -amazing.  The guy is a genius. The killer rhythm section of Appice and Franklin absolutely stun... this is a VERY well played and produced album. It also is not JUST straight hard rock, it has a lot of variation and shows Sykes' penchant for the blues. It also showcases Sykes' set of pipes -he sounds eerily like a better version of David Coverdale.<br /><br />I HIGHLY friggin' recommend this to ANY 80's hard rock collector who maybe had at one time or never owned it... This is the standard in hard rock and how it's done -similar to Tesla.  Be ignorant no longer and get it!

For some people, maybe it's a delight to read, but it isn't my cup of tea. I had to force myself to finish, just for the simple fact that I bought it. Make sure you are comfortable with your sexuality and if you're not, it may not be the book for you, and have wikipedia on hand to look up terms. LoL.

1451627289|1.0|Stephen King should be ashamed of himself. But he's probably not.  As America's top hack horror genre writer, he has written a terrible, horrible and frightening book. Terrible not just because it is so padded and stretched it's hard to believe any one but the most diehard will get through it -- they and we \\"tin hat\\" types like myself who are most interested in the continuation of the media and the minions who are a part of the cover up. I'm sure Mr. King is proud of himself.  Unfortunately, 11/22/63 will be read by sensible people, smart people for whom it may well be the only JFK assassination book they will ever read. Without the investigative background and analysis provided by real researchers (Mark Lane, Jim Marrs and others), this crap will be embedded in their psyches and the battle for the truth defeated.  Thanks a lot, Stephen. And by the way, you maybe a teller of tales, but you are an absolutely terrible writer.  The book is padded -- every scene milked till the udder is utterly dry. As to the imagined lives off Lee and Marina Oswald, they are just that -- imagined.  King simply leaves out all facts which contradict his fiction. Granted, it is just that -- pure fiction.  It really saddens me that King has put the love of money ahead of any other considerations -- but look who's rich and famous. Sorry Jack, sorry Lee and most of all sorry to the reader naive enough to believe this dishonest piece of shit. Enjoy your wealth, Mr. King -- those lying dollars will buy you a fine retirement.

0374214913|4.0|Clay is a quiet, unemployed geeky ex NewBagel employee. His job involved computers and it made him happy. And then it didn't because it faded away, as so many jobs do. So in order to make a living he tried ( but not too hard) to find new employment. His heart wasn't really in it.. and his mind kept tking him in other direction. But some things are meant to be, and in that spirit, we see him going through the door of Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore. And he finds himself face to face with sparkling blue eyes and an older man who asked him \\"What do you seek in these shelves\\". As it turns out, those words were to begin a journey that would change his life. For that matter, They would also change the life of Penumbra, the man who spoke them.<br /><br />The bookshop was tall and narrow. It was unlike any bookstore Clay had ever seen. And it was indeed unlike any other bookstore, anywhere. It was even unlike any bookstore anywhen. But it suited Clay, both the hours and the slightly ( slightly? ) weird atmosphere. The store was staffed by one other hired clerk, Oliver. Oliver was a student of archeology and The store suited him as well. It was hardly arduous being a clerk for Penumbra. Some nights, Most nights,  as clay worked the 10 pm to 6 am shift he would only see one so called customer. So called because most of the people who came through the doors never bought a book, they borrowed them. They borrowed them from the Wayback part of the long, tall store. Sometimes He was climbing a ladder and reaching, reaching to bring a book to a usually older man or woman who had a name, and a number that were to be recorded in a logbook Penumbra kept under the counter. The name, the number and a description of the reader were carefully logged, as well as their manner of dress and their demeanor. Clay was intrigued.<br /><br />During the long hours of the night, Clay was moved to create listing for the store on Google, and targeted local people, or those who might for some reason find themselves in the neighborhood. This too, was to have an interesting affect on Clays life. Funny how a small thing can have such a large impact. And so Clay found himself liking his unusual employer, and the more than slightly unusual little shop. It's a good thing, too considering what was to happen next.<br /><br />I can't tell you any more. I really want you to read this book. It's quirky, it's techie, its mysterious and even funny. You don't want to miss it. Like the bookstore itself, something like this book is probably a once in a lifetime opportunity. So.... what are you waiting for?

B0085776BG|5.0|I grew up during WWII and have always been interested in the history of WWII. The military was not integrated in the WWII and there Black units with outstanding records.  Besides the Red Tails there was a Tank outfit that fought in Europe that had very good record. On one of the island Pacific battles the Marines were short of men and asked the Black truck drives to volunteer to fight on the front lines and the volunteers did such a good job the Marines who they fought with would take on anyone who spoke down to them.  There should be more movies about these brave men who fought and died for there country even though the country mistreated them.

1401223176|4.0|I read this volume in two nights and was so impressed with the beautiful artwork.  Honestly, I am more interested in the art more than the storytelling.  Art aside, the storytelling was a tad lame.  :(  I guess I wasn't sure what to expect, but I do like Batman and want him to get closure in his life.  I'm not so much a fan of the \\"Dark Knight\\" Batman as I am just the regular 1940s version.  I recently started reading The Batman Chronicles and they're pretty great.  I am also a fan of Batman and Catwoman as a couple because Bob Kane and Bill Finger wrote her as an early love interest.  So why can't they ever make it work?  This book I guess tries, but doesn't get it right.  All in all it is a somewhat interesting storyline as some reviewers note, but the art is certainly the best part!  I hope future collaborations can get Batman and Catwoman together for good.

0374214913|5.0|\\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\" is a funny, charming, witty adventure for lovers of books (both real and digital) and popular culture. First-time novelist Robin Sloan has crammed quite a lot of color in a brisk 300-page read that most can probably finish in a handful of sittings. The pacing and dialogue are sharp, the characters unique and likeable, and the storyline is fresh and yet so reassuringly familiar as to provide a wonderful summer distraction, whether you are a commuter or laying on the beach. I can't help but enthusiastically recommend this nifty little book.<br /><br />My one-sentence summary would be: An out-of-work graphic designer, desperate for work, takes a job as a night clerk at a strange twenty-four hour bookstore, thus embarking on a remarkable cross-country journey full of puzzles and mysteries along with his unique collection of associates: an Industrial Light and Magic designer, a Google programmer-turned-executive, a young computer geek millionaire, a wise old bookstore owner, and more.  It's fun and relevant, stretching believability and credibility at times, but unlike some other reviewers I did not feel that it ran out of steam in the second half.  Indeed, I was very surprised by the twisty turns of the final third and was actually sad to see the story conclude when it did.  This is the rare type of book that could have easily been padded another hundred pages or so without bothering me one bit.  On a deeper level, beyond the lightweight adventure, there's a somewhat serious discussion here about the value of ebooks versus real books, and beyond that, learned old knowledge versus the instant technological wonders brought to us courtesy of Google.  Be warned that this novel draws no concrete conclusions, awards no winners.  Instead we have a nice combination of the two--a rare work of genius that makes books and computers both seem necessary in this modern age.  I think I'll be on the lookout for Mr. Sloan's next novel, with the hope that it offers the same type of imaginative, pop culture-infused, self-aware storytelling that I enjoyed so much this time around.

B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have done a lot with audio engineering.  I love the idea of remixing something that was recorded decades ago (especially a nearly perfect album).  I can only imagine what they could have done with the recent Beatles mixes had they actually re-mixed it (rather than enhance the \\"master\\" tapes) using modern technology.  I have A/B compared these new mixes to the cd I bought years ago....and let me say.... WOW!!....It is unbelievable how much better, and clearer EVERYTHING sounds....<br /><br />This review is based on this ALBUM.<br /><br />I have a few critiques....<br /><br />1) Detroit Rock City..... I remember a mix without the \\"get down\\" backup vocals that always sounded better....<br /><br />2) Flaming Youth.... I absolutely heard the \\"hiccup\\" at roughly :05 seconds that people have complained about.  I heard it the FIRST time, and then totally struggled to figure out.  The timing is ok, but there is a weird \\"hiccup\\" that is more apparent with these mixes....Is it a odd drum hit or knock on a guitar?... go figure......Perhaps it exists in the original mixes?<br /><br />3)  Where is the bonus material that was announced?  Augh!  Good thing I am evaluating the \\"new mixes\\", and the lack of not-including-cool-stuff-ed-ness!!!!<br /><br />4) Gene and Paul piss me off these days because they are touring with others dressed as Peter and Ace.  I cannot move on beyond this, because it is disrespectful.  Can you imagine Ace and Peter touring with dress-up Paul and Gene impostors?  This just makes me sick as a kiss fan . Kiss, like the Beatles, were the hottest band in the world... when they were four guys.... making music... they ALL played a part in each other's lives.<br /><br />G

0439023513|4.0|Has a book ever made you realize that sometimes a happy ending isn't always the right ending?  If not, you might want to try reading Mockingjay, by Suzanne Collins.  Suzanne Collins' third book in the Hunger Game series is such a captivating read because it keeps you feeling just a bit uncomfortable about how it's all going to end.  In Mockingjay, Katniss Everdeen continues her role as the heroin of the story, but her distance from Peeta and her role in the rebel uprising against the Captial creates a tension that lasts throughout this novel.  While the previous books in the series showed the kind of loss and sorrow typical of the Capital and its Hunger Games, Mockingjay takes this conflict to a deeper, more personal level. This book leaves the reader realizing that the world Collins has created is far from ideal and that not everything ties up neatly in a bow.  Read it.

The third floor is home to a large conference room with table and chairs, elevator access and an overlook to the great hall below.<br /><br />Personally I like the mayor's office of all the rooms. Throughout the building though you will feel the furnishings are very minimal; not quite enough items to interact with.  This set has an elevator as mentioned earlier which is much different than the stairs or escalators we have seen in the other creator sets. The roof and exterior are very detailed with skylight windows over the great hall and the detail of the clock tower. The set includes 4 male and 4 female persons of which 2 are boy and girl and the other 6 are adults: 1 bride, 1 groom, 1 mayor, 1 custodian, 1 photographer and 1 female secretary.  This set is great for pairing with [[ASIN:B004P2HMNM LEGO Creator Pet Shop]], [[ASIN:B0033PSLUK LEGO Creator Grand Emporium 10211]] and [[ASIN:B002O064J0 LEGO Creator Fire Brigade]].
B000GFLE1S|4.0|Greetings all,<br /><br />  The Little Shoe Store of Kink...one who could not survive as a small manufacturer of mens footwear...had looked for other ways to stay in business.<br /><br />  So, with a \\"Drag Queen\\" for a style adviser, found that manufacturing \\"Kinky Boots\\" would be their niche.<br /><br />  Its an interesting tale, quite well done, lovely story line, and an unusual twist on personalities and romance, and peoples hidden interests!  Well advised to purchase this...especially if you have an interest in \\"Fetish\\"!<br /><br />\\"Bizarre Suzanne\\"
1934356557|3.0|Very easy read with good format.  The book was more novice than I was hoping, overall, but I found a good chapter or two.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is the application development chapter.  The author likely should have stayed away from this topic altogether as the book just sort of bottoms out at this point.  This chapter left much to be desired as far as application development principles and anti-patterns go. It wasn't that the points were not good, they were just intern / 101 level concepts that belong in an application development book.  I would have never guessed the book would end on MVC.<br /><br />All that being said, this is a must read for intern - junior developers everywhere, both database and application developers alike.
B008XG1X18|4.0|love it have app on my phone and kindle only problem is on my fire it crashes and closes alot.:( but I still love it

B003N0XDT4|3.0|I'm not exactly an audiophile, but I love music and was searching for some gadgets that could make me feel like i was attending to a live music show while using a headphone and listening some tunes on my Macbook pro. That's what i though i'd get using E7+Audio Technica ATH M50 headphones, but unfortunately this is not what i got.<br /><br />To my ears, at least, using or not E7 doesn't make a huge difference. I was looking for quality improvement (like, for example, to listen new song details), but it looks like E7 serves more to avoid distortion at a higher volume (what i don't care).  Some people say that E7 gets better after a burn in period (what i really can't believe, since it's a electronic device, there are no mechanical parts). I'm using it for 3 weeks now, if i notice some improvement i'll update this review.<br /><br />So far, all in all, what i can say it's that E7 really disappointed me.
B0083EW97W|5.0|John Mayer is a consistently amazing artist who creates music that gets at you deep in your bones.  Another fantastic addition to his repertoire.  Wish I could give this album more than 5 stars!
0786955570|5.0|A wonderful combination of an old time D&D dungeon crawl and board game. It gives the feel of D&D that you can set up in minutes, rather than having a DM spend hours putting together an adventure. Very fun. Very replayable.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Oh I enjoyed this book so very much! I laughed and I cried(just a little) it was just a great story. At first Will's and Lake's love story seemed so easy, but surprise things come to the surface. That's what makes the story so good. This book has a lot of heartbreaking parts along with funny heartwarming parts. I am so happy this book was recommend highly and after reading the reviews I knew this one was going to be a 5 star review!!

0307730697|5.0|Absolutely fantastic book on a man who went from the absolute rock bottom of life to the top of the Tier One mountain. This book touched me unlike any other, it brought tears to my eyes.  Adam Brown was not the perfect man at one point in his life, but this book tells you of how he rose from the ashes of drug addiction to become a tremendous soldier, husband and father. We should all strive to have the work ethic and to care for others the way this man did.

0071752854|5.0|What an AWESOME book! Thank you, thank you thank you Oren. And no I do not know Oren and have never met Oren - much as I'd like to, let me tell you now.<br /><br />So quickly, if you're thinking of buying this book to learn how to successfully Pitch Anything ... DO IT! It'll be the absolute best $15 you'll ever spend. In fact after reading the book several times now I must say this book is WAY underpriced.<br /><br />Recently I did another quick review of this book on my brianlord dot com blog but soon I shall be going over the book with a microscope and laying it all out for you. In the meantime you must get this book and read it then follow chapter 8 and implement it.<br /><br />I apologise if I sound all over the place with this quick review but I'm excited. I've read and implemented loads of strategies from business books and to this end I know a great book when I read one. This is it.<br /><br />All I can say again is do yourself a favor. Get it, read it immediately and implement it. [[ASIN:0071752854 Pitch Anything: An Innovative Method for Presenting, Persuading, and Winning the Deal]]<br /><br />Sincerely<br />Brian
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is the perfect game for the Kindle Fire.  Companioned with the E-Book, \\"Angry Birds Game: Get All Golden Eggs On Angry Birds\\"  you've got it made!  TY!
B009329Y30|3.0|I read the book before I saw the movie, so of course that probably made me a bit skeptical from the start, but the details changed to adapt the book to a screenplay didn't change too much of the story. Zac Efron was not the right guy for the part of Logan, though. He was dull, stiff, and had no personality. Any kind of sexual tension or mystery with Logan or between him and Beth just didn't come across. Maybe with someone else playing the part of Logan it could have been a better movie, but if I hadn't read the book before I saw the movie and gotten a better feel for the characters' backgrounds, I think I would have been really bored.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app I love the highlighting, notes, availability to move from Bible book to book and I love the Bible devotions from various people such as focus on the family, Joyce Meyer and more.
B008N1LL42|5.0|I don't know why there are so many bad review of this awesome film!!  Maybe these people don't have HD, or a sound system - I don't know but I thought the movie was amazing!! Oh, it could be that they could not understand triangulation and the theory of displacement.  Tough to figure out for those who didn't finish high school!  I'm funny :)  Great movie!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a very nicely put together game. so far the graphics and game play are great. I'll be playing this during down time.
B00785P2QC|1.0|I play virtual city but this is ridiculous. you have to pay to play there is nothing free about this. unless you want to pay seriously don't waste your time.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I got these just before the 4th of July, so the trek to a fireworks viewing location was the first ride for my Monkey Lights.  They stopped traffic! Everyone thought they were awesome. Very impressive, although at slower \\"cruisin\\" speeds you will not get a full pattern around the whole wheel. I only purchased one because of the price, but as soon as I can afford it, I plan to add one to the other wheel.  The one and only downside is the pattern is selected by a series of on/off switches, so you have to memorize the one you want before you are out and about without the reference card.  Fortunately it was fun just randomly selecting one and going with it. It makes me want to ride my bike more, for sure!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Creative shows sometimes lose steam in Season Two, but with THE WALKING DEAD Season 2, it only gets better. The writers are on top of their game in Season 2 as our groups of survivors tries to out run the \\"walking dead\\" and find safety. The writers delve deeply into the moral issues facing the survivors. Nothing is simple and nothing is easy, yet there is an order in all the chaos if they can all stay together.<br />Our groups leaves Atlanta looking for the safe haven they image has been created by the military. The \\"walkers\\" are everywhere and in one frightening attack, young Sophia runs off into the woods.<br />Here is where the story begins to take a turn. Should the others risk their lives searching from someone who may already be dead? After a series of mishaps, the groups end up on the farm of Herschel and his daughters. Somehow his small band has been able to stay in place and survive. Now the power struggle begins between Hershel and Rick and Shane. There are some great thought provoking plot twists in season 2. Watch the season and see how the writers have incorporated so much drama into the series. For the survivors, the world as they knew it is gone. There is no longer a government to provide order and protections. It's every man for himself and can they survive.<br />It was all the moral dilemmas that astounded me in this season. Are the \\"walking dead\\" still people who could be cured at some point? What if your loved one was a \\"walking dead\\"? Is is right to risk more lives to possibly save one life? It was a random act of fate, that handfuls of people did not become part of the walking dead. It wasn't based on good or evil just chance. What happens when groups of survivors come into contact with each other?<br />I just could not stop watching this series. Each episode is more intense and brings up more moral problems. New characters are added and established characters are lost to the zombies. How will it all end?<br />There have been countless zombie movies and shows through the years. What exactly is a zombie and are they dead or living in another reality? This show could be another one of the silly zombie shows yet it is not. There is compassion in the hearts of people desperately hoping to survive and find the world they have lost. Inter-personal conflicts are real. How would any of us act under these circumstances.<br />Shane becomes a major player in Season 2 as he goes deeper and deeper into some brewing madness. We see an evil side of Shane this season that is unnerving.<br />Our group finally is not on the run for the time being. Hershel's farm is a refuge but there is an awful secret he is hiding. The show is simply amazing. If there is one weak spot in the plot, it's the constant movement of people into dangerous situations. If Carl disappears, Rick and Shane go looking for him. When they are gone too long, Lori goes looking for Rick. Rick and Shane return with Carl but now Lori is missing. This scenario plays out over and over to where it goes a bit overboard. At some point, almost everyone is out in the woods looking for someone. Are these risks worth it?<br />Incredible writing and great actors make THE WALKING DEAD a true gem. The writing in phenomenal as are the actors.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I downloaded Jetpack Joyride on my Kindle Fire, hoping for a fun game for my tablet. I had recently downloaded some disappointingly lame games, so I was decidedly skeptical when I began to play. But after the first few minutes, I was blown away. Gameplay was extremely simple, so I was quickly able to get good at the game. It hit the sweet spot between being challenging and being so frustratingly hard that I stopped having fun. I was very disappointed when I learned that buying new jetpacks didn't make you better, and were mostly a fashion statement. However, buying \\"Gadgets\\" made you considerably better.So that was okay. At the end of each level (provided you have spin tokens earned while playing) you could spin a wheel to win prizes. It was a great addition that made me want to play more. Although it could not overcome the limits of its genre (go as far as you can before you die) it was still awesome! I would recommend this free game to anyone. Great fun!
B007ZXK08C|1.0|This novel was so full of four letter words that I could not finish it.A good story spoilt , why books these days are so full of foul language when there are so many adjectives the writer could use instead. Very disappointed in this book.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game has great grafics and is simply addicting!!!!! I downloaded it just for the free game but it turned out to be an awesome game!!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read it all after putting down and picking up again when bored. I liked a few plot ideas like the anniversary hints left around town to mess with his head, etc. What I don't understand and will never agree with is how on earth this book made it to,,, \\"amazon book of the month\\" def not even worthy of an honorable mention. I do give kudos for taking a shot, and feel this writer has potential though!<br />I enjoyed following Amy's evil/crazy/unpredictable story. I did not like her, or sympathize with her at all, so I just give her credit for every time it looked like check mate. If there was a second book with these 2, I would read it though, just so I could hopefully cheer on whom ever takes Amy on. Inother words,,,keep writing Gillian!
B0084RSYEK|3.0|The movie does have a cute premise. More swearing than expected. I know,  I know what you're going to say - Eddy Murphey swears.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|If even once or twice  you end up in a hotel or other place with only a wired (Ethernet) connection, you will be very glad you own this. I travel a lot, and it still happens all the time that I discover that the wireless connection at the remote location just won't work, for whatever reason. Then, I just use the wired connection, which typically require less of the balky and unreliable authentication hotels love to impose before they grant you access. Saves so much grief. At just $29, this is worth owning, even if just as a road-warrior backup.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I kept hearing about this book, and got on a waiting list at my library for it. I was excited when I got it until I started reading. It was a huge struggle just getting through the first few chapters. By chapter three I gave up. It was sooooo beyond boring, and I hate when every little thing has a 2 page detail. The author goes on and on and on simply about a guy waking up to his alarm clock at 6 am. Who gives a shit? I do not understand the hype about this book. I asked a friend who read it to just tell me the whole story, and I'm quite happy that i didn't waste the time reading the entire thing!
0062124293|1.0|THought this would be a much funnier book.  Didn't like the constant vulgarities.  Some may find it amusing and the interview on NPR left me feeling this was a very funny woman but the book was so bad I gave it to Bookman's after reading about 50 pages.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game there's no problems with it again u should definetly download it!and the person who said it didn't save what u purchase when u get off the app it does so I give it 5 stars!!!:))))
0345803485|1.0|I decided several years ago that if something gained traction in pop culture, I should read or watch it, just to understand what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />I have just changed my policy. What a JOKE! This book was so poorly written, I had to do a dozen double-takes. Was this really published? Where was the copy editor? Where were the grown ups at the publishing house? Where was the plot?<br /><br />I'm embarrassed that I finished it, but honestly, I kept waiting for something to redeem it. It is a best seller, right?!<br /><br />Save yourself!!! There is nothing here but agonizing, juvenile writing (who wants to hear \\"jeez\\", \\"holy cow\\" and \\"oh, my\\" in a building erotic scene) and frustratingly empty characters who drop off the face of the earth.<br /><br />If you want soft porn, go get some. You will be much more satisfied.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this game sucks on kindle fire Cuz I waited forever on the videos that I tried to watch but they never loaded and when they did load they kept stopping and loading again finallyvi just deleted this app!don't get it!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|It sure beats solitaire as a way to fill some spare time. Just don't swear out loud in public when you miss that turn.
B005HEQ8KA|1.0|Don't make the mistake I made.  I have been re-watching the entire series from season 1 on without any problems. I love it. However, I watched this episode not realizing that part 2 is missing and not available at all. It makes no sense Amazon!  Get part 2 of this episode!

0345803485|5.0|If you are looking for some kind of natural story lines, this book is perfect. Detailed description, sensual languages... but written very very natural tone and accurate understanding of human emotions... The way she used curse words makes the book steamy hot and sexy!<br />It took me only few days to read the whole 3 books of Fifty Shades.<br />I love it very much and highly recommend this book to anyone else. Totally worth the $, I look forward to the movie!
B005RK6EUS|5.0|D. Who tends to have impressive season finales, and this is no exception! Mysterious and twisted until the close. Enjoyed the entire ride of the season and this well done end.
0425263908|1.0|I tried this book as I heard it was similar to Fifty Shade.<br />But I was so disappointed. The encounter of 2 Cross and Eva was not at all interesting to me. The more I like Fifty Shades, the less I like this book.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Works great and exactly as described.The syringe was easy to use and have the ability to screw the cap back on and reuse later.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|Hollywood, and the film industry internationally, have not been shy about making pictures about making pictures, or some other aspect of the movie industry. Some have been well-done like Day For Night others rather more self- indulgent like The Last Tycoon rather less so. The idea though of doing a film about the silent movie era by making a silent movie (almost totally) using a tried and true rags to riches theme and having audiences (or at least this reviewer and he was not alone) stay with the plot is a notch above all the other efforts.<br /><br />Okay, the plot of this thing has been done to death, the old star is born routine, this time with an aging male silent film star \\"stepping aside,\\"  kicking and screaming (silently of course) for a younger  female star who not only can mug for the camera but talk without embarrassing herself, her bosses or the audience. But it is not the plot line that intrigues but the pure artistry that it took to convey a story line back in the day by \\"mugging for the camera.\\"  I have seen some silent movies and I am sure more than one director or producer from that period would have died just to have the technology to produce such mugging in such crisp and seamless form back in the 1920s. This one is well worth seeing for just that reason.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This movie is great fun. It's not a documentary for crying our loud, and it doesn't try to make a political statement, it's just great fun. Relax and enjoy it.
B001P5M7QE|2.0|This is a classic movie that I love but I gave it two stars because the QUALITY of the video is substandard.. I would expect this from a bootleg site not from a legitimate site.  It will make me think twice about ordering another digital movie from here again.
0307592731|2.0|Let me begin by saying that Cheryl is a fairly good writer. She manages to convey strong emotions throughout the book - when she was anxious, I felt anxious as I read it.  When she felt accomplished, so did I. Similarly, she manages to accurately describe some of the hardships of hiking the PCT. This is the only reason I had to give the book two stars rather than one.<br /><br />Having said that - the book is filled with smut and immoral behavior on the author's part. As another author has already mentioned, very early in the book she finds herself staring at a doctor's crotch and wanting to have sex with him. These are the thoughts that come to her mind as she's sitting in a hospital next to her dying mother. Then she goes on to cheat on her husband multiple times with what sounds like equally trashy men. One of them being a heroin addict - a habit she picks up herself while she's with him. The feelings experienced by the loving and supporting husband seem completely inconsequential to her. This behavior doesn't end when she sets off to hike the PCT. Throughout her hike, \\"the world opens up its arms to her,\\" as she put it. By the world, she means mostly men, for obvious reasons. Sometimes she uses them for companionship, other times for assistance or to score free drinks, and of course, sex.<br /><br />Now, some radical feminists such as the author might claim that I, being male, am setting a double standard by calling this type of behavior immoral. However, if this book was written by a man, I would be just as repulsed by such actions. In fact, I feel that if a man wrote a similar book, it would not become a best seller - it would be chastised as a piece of sexist garbage. I certainly wouldn't disagree, and I feel like Cheryl's book deserves the same fate.<br /><br />Furthermore, I take serious issue with how she deals with loss and unfortunate circumstances in her life. I've experienced loss as well - in fact, I've gone on my own extended journey of self-discovery at one point after such an experience. However, rampant promiscuity and drug use should not be viewed as socially acceptable ways of dealing with one's problems. Not only that, but one should take into account that the author is never actually as \\"alone\\" as she makes it out to be. Sure, she doesn't have much of a family. But she had a loving and supportive husband whom she drove away. She has a multitude of friends - at one rest stop along the trail, she receives *NINE* letters in the mail. One actually from the ex-husband, who still cared about her, and another from the heroin addict she cheated on him with.<br /><br />To wrap it up, it sounds to me like the author lives in her own bubble, with an altered perception of the world where her own feelings matter far more than anything else in the world. Her way of thinking is summed up perfectly during one section of the book - where she is at a club where some guy she just met is manning the lights. As she waits for his shift to end so that she can sleep with him, her thoughts alternate between \\"I'm pretty\\", \\"I'm hideous\\", and \\"I can't wait to have sex with this guy so that these insecurities would go away.\\" Essentially, she is an irrational, insecure child, and I found her to be profoundly annoying.
B004QO9WVO|5.0|The book is a classic by a great author/writer a must read for everybody. Young and old can enjoy this book.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|An extraordinary piece of writing with a satisfying degree of complexity.<br />I was initially attracted by the high 5 star ratings by other reviewers, and attacked the book with a \\"this had better be good\\" attitude. It is!!!!<br />Ok, it does need some editing, but the flaws did not distract me from what is a truly excellent story.<br />The sequel can't come soon enough for me.
B002PLALCO|5.0|First watched this on Palladia then I purchased it from Amazon. What a fun, energetic colorful  concert not to mention a sexy pink !

B0059XTTW8|4.0|Based on the novel by John le Carre, \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" is a throwback to films like \\"The Ipcress File\\" and \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" - that is to say, a serious tale of secret agents set in that period quaintly known as the Cold War.<br /><br />Gary Oldman plays an agent for British Intelligence who's called out of retirement to uncover a possible mole in the top echelons of the agency.  Set in 1973, the complex - a bit too complex at times, perhaps - plot utilizes flashbacks to unravel much of its story.<br /><br />Written by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan and directed by Tomas Alfredson, the movie doesn't go for the cheap thrill or the easy stunt, relying on intellect rather than action-movie antics and pyrotechnic special effects to generate its suspense.  The tone is subdued and carefully modulated, the pacing slow and deliberate.  And fine performances by Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, et.al., and an appropriately chilly atmosphere make for enjoyable viewing.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|First and foremost, by their nature, the books are more intense and intriguing than the movies. Having said that, the movies have been made to be as close to the book's storyline as possible.  This last movie in the series is suspenseful, thrilling, and moving. I LOVE IT! A great buy for any Harry Potter fan!
0765365278|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has written one of the greatest fantasy novels ever in The Way of Kings.<br /><br />There has already been so many positive reviews, let me emphasize the troubles and fears I found with this book, and hopefully illustrate that (with the exception of one) they do not detract.<br /><br />First, the anticipation. Sanderson has become an expert at keeping our hopes and expectations at a fever-pitch, only granting us the tiniest morsel of satisfaction as he tears through to the conclusion of the novel. I have never read at a faster pace than I did in the last 440 pages.<br /><br />Some of the greatest moments of this novel occur in flashback however--this is both a boon and a failing. Sanderson starts off in \\"Act 2\\" of the traditional 3-act story structure, placing the \\"boring\\" backstory parts before the novel proper even begins. But then he goes back and illuminates the boring backstory parts.<br /><br />This turns out to be...well, boring.<br /><br />Luckily we are invested in the character of Kaladin by then, so at the very least we may want to know what has motivated him to develop the way he has.<br /><br />We finally see the conclusion of the Act 1 flashbacks around pages 660-700, and the conclusion is great. Really, really great.<br /><br />Although Kaladin's undeveloped Act 1 character seems more petulant than noble, in Act 2, he develops quite a lot; there is still the fear that his character will end up being petty, or allowing his pettiness to overcome him. Syl even says, \\"This darkness about you when you talk of them frightens me, Kaladin.\\"<br /><br />Kaladin is the story and the story is Kaladin. The other characters never seem more than second-fiddle to Kaladin. Shallan and Jasnah are only tangentially connected to the action occurring at the Shattered Plains. We do not see enough of Szeth to know him, and his inability to take control of his own actions is beyond frustrating.<br /><br />Dalinar and the eponymous the Way of Kings that he reads and tries to follow are the only real challenger for the title of protagonist.<br /><br />By the end of the novel, Dalinar, Shallan and even Szeth take great strides, but only Kaladin provides any great climax and resolution, even if that resolution only serves to heighten the anticipation for the next novel.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this novel goes down as one of my all-time favorites, but I am afraid. There is so much hope, so much expectation, so much interest in everything Roshar, Sanderson will need to maintain the level of writing found in The Way of Kings or will risk spoiling this amazing book. This is the one exception that may detract from The Way of Kings, but we will not know until the series develops.<br /><br />This book promises everything, but asks you to wait for the delivery. We are left hoping that the delivery will be worth it. From what we have seen so far in The Way of Kings, it will be.eads and tries to follow are the only real challenger for the title of protagonist.<br /><br />By the end of the novel, Dalinar, Shallan and even Szeth take great strides, but only Kaladin provides any great climax and resolution, even if that resolution only serves to heighten the anticipation for the next novel.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this novel goes down as one of my all-time favorites, but I am afraid. There is so much hope, so much expectation, so much interest in everything Roshar, Sanderson will need to maintain the level of writing found in The Way of Kings or will risk spoiling this amazing book.

1906694176|2.0|I found this book very boring.  The many many long tiresome explantions of Sweden's politics could have used some critical editing.  I kept at it for the story line but many times wondered whether it was worth the plodding through.  Decided yes only if you've read the first two in the series.
020161622X|5.0|I've bought this book more than once - always keeping a copy for myself, in addition to giving them to colleagues.  It's mostly things that can be bundled into the categories of either common sense or best practices, but it's laid out in a way that helps to break things down into well thought out nuggets.  The information comes in easily digestable sections, with almost the feel of individual essays.  At only a little over 250 pages before the appendices, it's a quick and fun read.  It gets to the point while neither being preachy nor beating a dead horse.  Well, it's actually 70 points, or \\"tips\\" as the author calls them, each well written and easily remembered.

0439023521|5.0|I am reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.  The story takes place in the city of Panem which was once North America.  The Hunger Games are a bloody battle to the death and are the capitol's way of showing that they have power over the 12 districts of the country. Two kids from each of the districts are chosen to compete in the games each year.  The main characters are Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. They live in District 12. Katniss and Peeta, along with 22 other kids, are trapped in the arena in a battle to the death.<br /><br />It was interesting to see how the different characters reacted to the horrible situation of being in the Hunger Games.  A group of kids called careers hunted down other tributes during the night and killed them.  A small girl named Rue stayed away from people and hid.  She avoided any killing.  Katniss, at the beginning, hid but towards the end of the Games she was forced to start hunting.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to kids who can handle death and destruction.  If I was the author, I would not have gone into such detail with some of the deaths as they may disturb younger readers.  The Hunger Games was a very good book and I hope you consider reading it.
B0053O89JM|5.0|The final season of House really surprised me in a pleasant way.  The start was so good, as we focused on House.  The last few episodes weren't quite as good, but they at least focused on the two main characters, House and Wilson.  That recognized that in the end, Wilson was right up there with House in importance.  I found the finale to be OK.  I liked the end, but the lead up didn't do much for me.  Still, when a great show ends, I don't have much hope for the last episode, so I can't complain too much.<br /><br />I felt bad for Adams.  She was an interesting character, until the writers felt the need to turn her into Cameron Jr.<br /><br />Very much worth getting if you've been watching.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I very much liked this book. Although I personally have no aspirations to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, I enjoy reading about other people's adventures. This book was written in a very engaging style, and I could hardly put it down once I started. I would highly recommend it to others. It is a fast read.
B005ONTD42|5.0|Held out on buying my own Sphero because this is kinda expensive. My friend had one and he let me use his, but I bought one when they announced more new apps. Just played the Color Grab app - very cool as is, but probably cooler as a drinking game with friends!

0380807343|5.0|Neil Gaiman is one of my most favorite writer. From American Gods to Sandman, I have enjoyed much of hos writing. He is excellent at illustrating his stories with his words, and Coraline is no exception to that.<br /><br />I've seen the movie, and I think that the book is much better.
B008602KQI|5.0|Really great movie, hope there will be follow-up movies using the same characters.  Jennifer Lawrence did a fantastic job and must be in the following sequences'
0345803485|4.0|After hearing a couple of friends raved about the book, i had to find a way to read it.  I was done in 3 days.  Its a love/lust story was good; reminded me of Twilight however for adults.  The writing and repetition was not the best rather annoying overall i give it 4 stars.  I would recommend to a friend.

B003H9M1Q2|5.0|As charming, thoughtful and endearing as ever, ageless.  Maybe even more pertinenet in today's world than when first issued, with it's themes of acceptances, bullying and believing in oneself.  Love this film when I was 7, love it even more for my grandchildren and me too at 70.
0307951529|5.0|I loved this book - I listened to the Audible audiobook version of it, which was just wonderful.<br /><br />I found it engaging, enjoyable and most importantly to me, inspirational.<br /><br />To me, the inspiration and sense of possibility from all these stories is a great gift.<br /><br />No, this book is not a step by step formula for how to do anything - but there's plenty of information both in the book and easily available elsewhere.  For me, what I find most helpful is the inspiration - and that helps me to tune in to how people who have done things like what I want to do think about what they are doing - it's that mind/heart place that makes the biggest difference for me.

B0072X2O66|5.0|Anyone hoping for AdMob to sound like a perfect mix of SX and DT would hate this album.  The point of AdMob was not to create a predictable sound that satisfies fans of the member's original bands, but to create a new band with a new sound.  And quite possibly find a new audience.<br /><br />The fact that some dyed in the wool fans of the artists' original bands cant accept any change of course in these artists career is understandable.  It happens all the time.  Luckily for you unbending fans there is a huge back catalog of old material from the original bands to make you all happy.  And luckily for others, there are some fans (like myself) that want to see what happens when these guys step out of the box and try something new.  Good lord this CD ROCKS!  Yes, there are some awkwardly tender moments on the CD.  But given the age, maturity, and depth of these guys it's totally understandable if not forgivable.  I think this CD is one of the best metal CDs this year.  The musicianship on this recording is OUTSTANDING!  What a great record.  Appeals to everyone except the unbending fans slugging through the cobwebs of the past that can't let go of what they want this album to sound like as opposed to what it is.
0525478817|3.0|I took a break out of reading the next book of A Song of Ice and Fire with The Fault in Our Stars. It's a fun, quick read. The characters are a little reminiscent of Looking For Alaska, but nevertheless I really enjoyed this read. I liked that the characters were able to joke about their illnesses instead of angst the entire time about it--though I suppose there was a good amount of angst in the places angst should be. I was hoping the ending would have been a little different, but it served it's purpose.<br /><br />Give the book a read--but don't open the cover to begin your read already thinking you've made your decision on how awesome the book is. I don't believe it's worth 5/5 stars, but it is definitely a good book. It demands to be felt.
1250000971|5.0|I really enjoyed the two novels by Jeffrey Archer, namely ONLY TIME WILL TELL and THE SINS OF THE FATHER. The plot of the story is really unpredictable and every development of the story has excited me. I was very much involved with the story and have read up them in a week despite of my quite poor English. (I am a Japanese.)<br />But now I have a frustration. The story, to my understanding, has not completed yet and I would like to know when the third novel of this series can be obtained. Frankly, I cannot wait long and would like to have your advice on this point.

0937381888|1.0|This book is most certainly not for beginner brewers. It is by far too technical for somebody who is just brimming with excitement to brew a first batch.<br /><br />The author delves into the biochemical properties of sugars not 30 pages into the book. I had to reread sections and look up many of the terms he used on wikipedia and google just so I can understand what was going on and why this information was relevant. An example from page 7, defining a hydrometer:<br /><br />\\"A hydrometer measures the difference in specific gravity between pure water and water with dissolved sugar. A hydrometer is used to gauge the progress of fermentation by measuring one aspect of it, attenuation.\\"<br /><br />Although, everything said is 100% accurate and people who already know how a hydrometer works may appreciate this definition - I, as a beginner found this laughable.<br /><br />After the 14-page long crash course in brewing, I was still eager to learn why I was doing all the things I was doing. Instead, I learned how sodium percarbonate is sodium carbonate reacted with hydrogen peroxide and how sodium metasilicate increases its effectiveness on proteins and prevents corrosion of metals.<br /><br />This is not a guide - it is a dry, loosely structured reference on the beer-making science. It is the difference between showing how to cook a good steak and explaining how grass broken down biologically makes the cow fat.
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed these books, I am half way thru the 3rd, and hope she is going to carry on with the series. I also read all of the True Bloods books, and I hope they continue as well. The Fifty Shades of Grey are Very sexy, but not dirty, very well written I thought.
034580404X|5.0|I love love love this book.  I must say that when I got the book I could not put it down.  I stayed up until six am reading and I did not stop until I finished all three.  I would definitely recommend Fifty Shades of Grey to everyone.

B008BM9L72|5.0|I purchased the trilogy based on all the hype as I was curious. Was not disappointed, it's a great holiday read and a lot more entertaining than your typical Mills & Boon special.
1416583432|2.0|I haven't yet finished this book but I'm half way through it.  All I can say is it is not an easy read.  Yes it is very informational but she uses words that nobody uses or knows, almost as if she's trying to sound as smart as she possibly can but it really takes away from the book. It also makes it a very boring read because you'll find yourself doing more skimming than anything.
1594744769|2.0|This book should have been titled: \\"How I Wrote a Crappy Book About Some Photos I Found, and Got Away With It\\".<br /><br />The main character is painful, he sounds like a selfish, immature 25 year old. He does not have the voice of a teenager nor the temperament. The book was not only a painful read, but ends with a cliff hanger that I won't be following up.<br /><br />This was a project in money making, not in artistry.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this game is great. I love to play the games. Every day that I play I unlock other games.
B004KA9VGA|3.0|This book is literally Twilight for grown ups, well minus the annoying teen love triangle.  If you like vampire romance, then this book is for you - but if you like vampire sex, then don't bother with this book.  It's very sweet and coy and old fashioned in the romance department, which is nice.  There is nothing very new about this book, but the setting of Oxford University, and in particular its library is a nice change from other more run of the mill settings.  Of course with all witchy books there are some kooky aunts in a big old magical house.  Matthew the vampire lead lives in a castle in France, and has more money than God.  Yawn yawn.<br /><br />This is a nice book.  It's not an action packed book, or a sexy book, it's just nice, and that's ok.  If you like a bit of old fashioned, sharp toothed love, then you'll enjoy A Discovery Of Witches.
B004XN3FHA|4.0|This is a great light, it carries well, and has an impressive throw.<br />Everyone, that I have given a demo to, is blown away... The difference between 800 lumens and 336 lumens is<br />not as big of a jump as you might think, but 336 lumens out of this flashlight looks like a spot light.<br />800 justs makes the very center of the light more intense. The TK15 is next on my list.
1609611543|5.0|My wife has celiac disease so I'm very familiar with the gluten connection in this book's discussion. However, the author's case isn't about gluten as some could assume. This book's premise is based on the apparent harm modern GENETICALLY ALTERED wheat does to general health and its added peculiar connection to weight gain around our middles. The author makes a very compelling case but how much of the derived benefits come from removing wheat from our diets and how much from the simple reduction in carb intake? Is it one, the other or a combination of both? And how much is the individual response a factor? The author discusses these variables but leans more FORCEFULLY on the notion that it is indeed modern wheat and its components that should be avoided. Its a good read, includes some simple biochemistry for those who are interested. A guide on what to eat and what to avoid. And a couple of dozen simple recipes as well. The author makes the critical point that going wheat free does not assign you to a life of deprivation and hunger.<br />I removed wheat from my diet exactly 4 weeks ago I have dropped 5 pounds and no longer feel hungry most of the time. That's the big one for me...the hunger.<br />Whether real or placebo, the effect has been positive and the weight loss real.
B004UJAOLM|2.0|I started reading this book because of all the hype about it. I couldnt get into it at all. I stopped reading it after a few pages. Then I saw a review of it on the telly and I definitely stopped trying to get into it. They certainly didnt do the book any favours. It was badly written and the content wasnt that great. Might watch the film though !
B001AOKA3W|1.0|The movie is supposed to be from the point of view of a handheld camera. First 10 minutes of this view is interesting but over an hour of the movies bouncing around gave me a headache and made my friend nauseous. Asked all my friends that saw it too and they said the same.

B006O7XOOW|5.0|This toy's concept seems simple and repetitive, but it's a big hit! There's a roller to set it in motion; the center area rises and the balls randomly go down one of three legs. One leg has two bumpers, one has two ramps, and the third has a single bumper. There's also an additional piece that can be rotated to make sounds or music, without causing an \\"eruption.\\"<br /><br />The sound has two volume settings, and the music is surprisingly relatively pleasant for an electronic sound (especially when set on low)--and it encourages dancing!<br /><br />The balls are a good size for small hands, and have happy little faces on them. The details on the toy parts (a lot of smiling faces on ball-like shapes) make it extra cute.<br /><br />From a baby's point of view, this is a great toy--no real complaints (The balls don't always stay with the set, though! They're a little too tempting as stand-alone toys). The one minor complaint is that it can be a little overwhelming since it's not possible to watch all the ramp legs at the same time when an eruption happens.<br /><br />There are only two negatives I can say from an adult's perspective. One is that the assembly takes muscle and sweat to get the screws into the plastic. It was the most difficult toy I've ever assembled, although I appreciate that it's screwed together securely. One other note in regards to assembly is that the battery \\"door\\" is sealed with a rubbery-type plastic so that even after it's unscrewed, you'll possibly need to pry it open with something to get batteries installed.<br /><br />The other \\"problem\\" is that the balls don't always stay in the toy--in essence, when they roll down the legs, they often hit each other or otherwise don't go down properly, and end up on the floor instead of in the cubbies on the bottoms of the legs. The capacity of each cubby is two, and since there's no way to know which leg each ball will go down, this is another way they end up on the floor. This isn't necessarily something wrong, but it's not a self-contained toy and the balls can end up rolling everywhere.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a fun toy. It's amazing how something so simple can be enjoyed so much--by baby and adult! It's fun to watch.g wrong, but it's not a self-contained toy and the balls can end up rolling everywhere.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a fun toy. It's amazing how something so simple can be enjoyed so much--by baby and adult! It's fun to watch.

B0000024KQ|5.0|I've been looking at this CD for some time and debating on whether to purchase it or not.  I know in the past that first initial releases of albums from some rap artists are great, only to disappoint on their following releases; however, this wasn't the case with \\"All We Got Iz Us\\".  I was thoroughly impressed with the album as a whole and am kicking myself for not buying this sooner than I had.  This album is just as mean, gritty, and dirty as their first release and the guys seem to be even more angry than in their Bacdafucup release.  I can't really say there is a weak song on this album because there isn't one.  Overall, I'm pleased with this album and, if you like Onyx, or are a casual fan, like me, I would highly suggest checking this album out.

B004UNX1LS|1.0|This app runs very poorly (when it runs at all) on the Fire. It crashes frequently and you have to force a close. In a few cases it locked up my Fire so I had to power down to recover.<br /><br />The few videos I did manage to play were very low res and unpleasant to watch.<br /><br />Until these problems get fixed it's not worth downloading for the Fire. A shame, since this app seems to have a lot of potential.

159562015X|1.0|The only reason I bought this book \\"new\\" was because its SUPPOSED to come with an access code needed for class. I got the book, it was in plastic & said \\"new\\" outside. After opening the book & flipping to the back where the access code  should of been there was nothing, & looking closer you can clearly tell that a page was RIPPED out of the book.

B000SEGEKI|4.0|Pragmatic Programmer touches on many excellent software development practices and design methodologies, although there is not much depth on any one topic.  If I had read it much earlier in my career, I think I would have learned a lot more from it.  But I've been developing for 12+ years now, and I've already picked up on nearly everything this book had to say.  I guess I already was a \\"Pragmatic Programmer\\".  I found myself skimming a lot of the sections and whispering to myself, \\"Yeah, yeah, good stuff.  I know this already.\\"<br /><br />The book is very readable, although it lacks personality.  Not dry, just impersonal.  It has a lot of \\"We think this, we think that...\\" but I kept asking myself, who is \\"we\\"?  What experiences informed these points of views?  How long have the authors been developing code, and in what subspecialties?  Sure, some of this information about the authors can be looked up.  But I'd rather have seen some of these details come out in the text of the book itself, in the course of explaining their points of view.

1439102430|2.0|I always rush to put in an order for a Kathy Reichs book, so I can read it as soon as I can.  How disappointed I was to start this book.  I am half way through and it has done nothing to grasp my attention.  We have Ryan and an old flame of Temperance snipping at each other, and she is not certain of what to do with them.<br /><br />The pacing, the facts, the excitement are all missing from this book.  Maybe writing 1 book a year, plus now short stories for Kindles, have been too much.  I prefer an author who writes because she has a good story to tell, rather than one who is just trying to keep her name out there, and to make $.<br /><br />I know she can do better.

0380715430|3.0|This is a wide ranging book, covering the sources of language, the evolution and changes of the English language, English versus other languages, English as a world language and idiosyncracies of English spelling, pronunciation and names.  The author, Bill Bryson, provides a large amount of detailed information in a format that flows.  There is no overarching theme, so the book should mainly appeal to those who are generally curious about the English language.
B005HSL626|2.0|This started out great and really entertained my kids however it now stops in the middle of a game and you can't restart it. It's really frustrating to have this happen when my kids are playing it. This has been happening regularly.
B005MJFA2W|4.0|Great book, quite insightful. You might think you are in control but the science says you are not. The basic premise is brought out in the first quarter of the book. The bulk of the rest is about research leading up to that premise. Some of the conclusions seems a bit obvious but that is part of the point. Kahneman is trying to prove the obvious and the counterintuitive.<br /><br />Kahneman is a lucid. compelling writer. His style is quite approachable. I am sure the terminology could have gotten pretty specific but he tries to use common language for us commoners. He does overuse the word heuristic, which has many meanings and depends on the field it is used in.<br /><br />Really worth the read.

0062197258|4.0|Elizabeth Haynes layers on the suspense gradually until your anxiety becomes almost unbearable.  Along the way you come as close as possible to experiencing and appreciating what it is be in the clutches of a controlling and abusive person.  You also get to feel how debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder can be, how it can make living a normal life nearly impossible.  In fact, the affliction of Cathy Bailey is a unique aspect of the novel, setting INTO THE DARKEST CORNER apart from the general run of put upon women fiction.  It is the kind of book you can say without any exaggeration you cannot put down until you have finished it.<br /><br />When we meet Cathy, she is a real party girl living in Lancaster (northwestern England).  She's out on the town almost every night with her girlfriends, a frisky bunch, indeed.  Lots of drinking.  Lots of sleeping around.  Until she meets what appears to be the ideal man, Lee Brightman.  He falls for her instantly.  He pursues her and wins her over with his incredible good looks, his charm, and his adoration.  It's all good, until Cathy finds herself under his control that escalates into sometimes hard-to-read abuse.  He almost murders her, as he did his previous obsession, but for a bit of luck.  For his crime against her, he receives three years in prison.<br /><br />Haynes tells her story of abuse in chapters that alternate with her present life.  Her experience has left her compulsive about checking her apartment and surroundings, always with the feeling that Lee has her under surveillance, that he will enter her apartment without her knowledge, as he did during their time together.  She has excellent reason to be concerned, because she knows he will not leave her alone and that very soon he will be free, and is released from prison during the course of the novel.  Fortunately for her, Stuart, a psychologist, moves into the apartment above hers.  They fall in love and he helps her face and overcome her OCD, in time for the ultimate confrontation with Lee.<br /><br />Yes, there is some convenient coincidence and the end leaves you a bit puzzled.  However, these are small nitpicks in comparison to the overall power of the novel.  It is an absolutely spellbinding and informative thriller (the author was a police intelligence analyst).  Haynes writes with a clarity and authority that belies the fact this was her first novel.<br /><br />I especially found her psychological treatments fascinating, both the OCD and the controlling personality of Lee.  It brings to mind another novel I like very much and have in my list of top-notch killer fiction, [[ASIN:B005EMUJDW i, Killer]].  In I, KILLER the author tells the story from the serial killer's perspective, a killer suffering from OCD, as well as other psychological problems.<br /><br />Haynes has impressed me so much that I've added INTO THE DARKEST CORNER to my Killer Crime Fiction Listmania!  You can see the full list by clicking on Explorer above.<br /><br />As for INTO THE DARKEST CORNER, you'll find yourself double-checking that your doors and windows are locked, it's that convincing.
0307951529|5.0|This book was a very quick and very entertaining read. He dispels most of the myths (which are often excuses) about starting a business and gives great examples of people who've taken the plunge and succeeded. There are loads of good ideas and lots of inspiration packed in this book. I turned down almost every single page to refer to later. I would have liked the examples to go a bit more into depth as occasionally they were broken up to make a point and I would have preferred the continuity of the whole story. Aside from that I loved this book and have given it to several friends to inspire them. There is no time like the present to create a life you truly love and this book will give you the push you need to do it!
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the book and I loved the movie when I saw at the theater, so when it became available for pre-order, I couldn't pass it up. The Blu Ray is packed with many special features, which I personally really like. There is a long and very thorough \\"Making of\\" featurete. It includes adapting the screenplay from the book, casting the kids (and adults), shooting the film, post-production, and music and sound effects. The director is interview quite extensively and it is quite interesting to hear his take on story and production of the film. For those that love this movie, this is a great Blu Ray to get.
1609611543|1.0|I didn't buy this book, but was interested enough after the author's appearance on TV to check it out. Friendly, easy reading format. Explanations seem logical and simple to follow. First thought, I can get all these benefits by not eating wheat? I can do that. Then I read the restrictions -  no grains like quinoa, no rice, no fruit, no corn or starches. Back to early Atkins - fat, meat, dairy and vegetables. That's it. I've tried that several times over the past forty years. None of these \\"new\\" diet plans ever yell you what happens when your brain is screaming for glucose and you give in and add a little carb here and another there. All of the weight you lost comes back very quickly, plus more. Limiting or eliminating any essential food group is unhealthy.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The film adaptation of The Hunger Games is one of the very best adaptations of novel to screen that I have ever seen. The film captures both the flavor and the essence of the best-selling novel, and this film is destined to become a classic. In point of fact, films as good as \\"The Hunger Games\\" only come around once in a while. This movie and story have a gripping, easy to follow plot that is full of surprises and action. And the film makes a powerful statement against totalitarianism. The real point of this story is the oppression exercised by \\"The Capitol\\" against the working class citizens of \\"The Districts\\" and the symbolic defeat of this oppression through the humanity and heroism of the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is magnificent as Katniss Everdeen in this gripping story and is exactly as I had envisioned Katniss to be when I read the novel. The supporting cast is just as good, and the presence of Donald Sutherland as the heartless \\"President Snow\\" adds a pleasant surprise to this fine film. The callous manner in which the media stars at \\"The Capitol\\" embrace and enable the oppressive \\"Hunger Games\\" is particularly chilling, and the stars in this film do a matchless job of portraying this.<br /><br />This film and story are a superb work of imagination for all ages. The only caveat is that this is one violent film with numerous bloody sequences that are probably inappropriate for small children. In particular the viciousness of the \\"career\\" tributes is absolutely convincing and not something that a small child should be exposed to.<br /><br />After seeing this film we will all look forward to the second film in this trilogy. RJB.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|Greedy Spiders 2 is the FAOTD that I have been waiting for. It is a family friendly game that has excellent sound, graphics, and music, as well as addicting and challenging gameplay.<br /><br />Your main object is to free all the bugs before the spiders eat them, or to trap these creepy crawlies with nowhere to go. This is all accomplished by cutting away pieces of their web.<br />The first few levels are incredibly simple, and serve as a good introductory tutorial to the game, but once power ups and multiple spiders enter the mix - it becomes really fun to free the critters before their time runs out.<br /><br />What I like most about this game is the fact that each and every level has many solutions, and you are rewarded for being clever. Solving a level with a three star rating (perfect) unlocks the next three levels for you to play with. Solving a level with a \\"better than three star\\" rating gives you coins that you can use to make other levels easier! Way to go developers! I really enjoyed seeing \\"better than three stars\\" pop up on my screen, and the rewards this message brought.<br /><br />Another thing the game has going for it are the great cartoony graphics and animations. The flies will sweat and squirm when spiders get close, stick out their tongue if you freeze a spider just before meal time, and many other cool touches that help bring the levels to life. The sound and music have a lot of variety and also contribute in this aspect.<br /><br />To round things off, Greedy Spiders 2 also has a ton of achievements to complete, each of which will reward you with coins!<br /><br />My only real complaint about this great single player game is that it requires network permissions that it just does not need (they are not used for anything necessary here), so I am docking it one star.<br /><br />Get this game. Free, or priced at $.99, it will give you and your family many hours of entertainment.
B0090SI3CA|4.0|If you've ever asked yourself what would happen if William Friedkin - director of The Exorcist and The French Connection - decided to make a drive-in movie, the answer is that he has and that Killer Joe is that movie.  The sub-title in the movie poster for Killer Joe actually sums up the film rather neatly:  \\"A totally twisted deep-fried Texas redneck trailer park murder story\\".  Except that it doesn't tell you that it's also one of the most darkly comic films to hit the theaters in years, joining the ranks of films like Delicatessen, Pulp Fiction and In Bruges, along with more over-the-top works like John Waters' Pink Flamingos, and Pedro Almod&oacute;var's Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!  Truly, Killer Joe is a cult film in the making.<br /><br />The plot begins with Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) showing up one night in a run-down trailer park, banging on the trailer where his father lives.  Seems Chris's mother, Adele, has kicked him out of her place - again - and Chris is broke, angry and desperate; a bad combination in a guy who's not the sharpest tool in the shed.  Particularly when the shed - or trailer as the case may be - is filled with other tools of questionable sharpness like his father Ansel (a marvelously deadpan Thomas Haden Church), his father's new wife Sharla (Gina Gershon) and his sweetly not-all-there sister Dottie (Juno Temple).<br /><br />Chris, it turns out, is in a situation.  A not-too-bright drug dealer and even worse gambler, Chris owes some fairly nasty people a lot of money and has no means with which to pay them.  And neither, obviously, does Ansel.  So why is Chris coming to Ansel?  Unfortunately for everyone, Chris has had an idea.  It seems that Chris heard from his mother's new husband Rick that his mother has a $50K life insurance policy and that his sister, Dottie, is the sole beneficiary.  Chris has also heard about a Dallas cop named Joe Cooper who has a rather interesting side-business:  he kills people for money.  So Chris has come to Ansel with the proposition that they hire this Joe Cooper to kill Adele, Dottie gets the insurance money, which they proceed to divide up in equal shares and then Chris can pay off the fairly nasty people before they kill him.<br /><br />Enter Joe Cooper (a riveting can't-look-away performance by Matthew McConaughey). Dressed almost entirely in black from his cowboy hat and long coat and to his meticulous leather gloves and boots, Joe moves through the world like a rattler always ready to strike, with a voice so supremely controlled that he never has to raise it and cool blue eyes constantly assessing everyone and everything with calm dispassionate calculation.  From the moment this man-in-black enters the scene, two things are clear:  that the Smiths are clearly out of their depth and have no idea who - or what - they're dealing with, and that Joe knows immediately he's dealing with a gaggle of idiots.  Particularly when it becomes clear that they've called him in spite of the fact that they don't have the money to pay him, violating his number one rule:  cash payment in full, up front, no exceptions.  He tells Chris and Ansel to get lost and that their meeting never happened, but when he turns to go he sees Dottie outside, waiting prettily by his car.  And now it's Joe who has an idea.<br /><br />Having already met Dottie when he showed up at the trailer and Chris and Ansel weren't there, Joe finds himself fascinated by Dottie's strange mix of sweet simplicity and almost freakish perceptiveness with regard to everything going on around her.  Turning back to Chris and Ansel, Joe makes them an offer he knows they won't refuse - since they don't have the money, he'll take Dottie as his 'retainer', to be his until such time as the job is done, the insurance money is collected and he gets paid.  Chris - whose brotherly feelings for Dottie it seems are more than a bit incestuous - loudly objects but is overridden by both Ansel's shrugging what-choice-do-we-have? resignation and his own desperation. And from that point on events begin to tumble out of whatever imagined control the Smiths thought they might have of the situation, building towards a truly freakish climax when things go wrong.<br /><br />A lot of what makes Killer Joe work is the superb cast and their ability to play their roles absolutely straight without any disarming winks or nods to  the camera, and their ability to deliver bleakly funny lines without laughing themselves, as when Thomas Haden Church's slow-witted Ansel sourly asks Sharla \\"Are you done fumigating the gates of hell?\\" when she returns from freshening up.  Gina Gershon's Sharla is played to the trailer-trash hilt, a woman who might be slightly smarter than her idiot husband and step-son but who it turns out isn't anywhere near as smart as she thought she was being.  Emile Hirsch's Chris is delightfully pathetic, making you cringe as he careens from one bad decision to another, never apparently having the brains to know when he should quit no matter how many times he screws up and/or gets the crap beaten out of him.  But it is Juno Temple's Dottie and Matthew McConaughey's Joe that truly hold the film's center.  Temple finds the fine line that defines Dottie's mix of seeming innocence and uncanny perceptiveness and walks it subtly, bringing her character out in stages, like when Dottie casually says to a stunned Chris and Ansel \\"I heard you all talkin' about killin' Mama.  I think it's a good idea.\\"  But it is McConaughey who delivers the most riveting - and disturbing - performance as Killer Joe.  It says something that being a contract killer turns out to be one of the more _normal_ aspects of this character, particularly where sex is concerned, which is probably a large part of what earned the film it's NC-17 rating.  The interactions between Joe and Dottie are priceless, particularly in the beginning, where Joe's rattlesnake finds himself repeatedly caught off-guard by this mouse he doesn't quite know what to make of, as in this exchange from their first \\"date\\" when Joe has dinner alone with Dottie:<br /><br />Joe:  \\"Tuna casserole! May I serve?\\"<br />Dottie:  \\"How are you gonna kill my mama?\\"<br />Joe:  \\"That's not appropriate dinner conversation, Dottie.\\"<br /><br />It's a pity that a film like Killer Joe will probably get overlooked - or more likely, shunned - at Oscar time because McConaughey's performance as Joe Cooper is, in my opinion, his finest work to date and truly merits consideration for a Best Actor nomination.  All of the cast are truly outstanding in their performances, but McConaughey nails Joe Cooper in ways that will stay with you long after the film is over.  It really is an iconic performance.<br /><br />Adapted from a stage play that Tracy Letts originally wrote back in 1991 and that had a nine-month off-Broadway run in 1998, Killer Joe is actually Letts' second collaboration with William Friedkin, the first being the equally controversial 2006 film Bug, with Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon, which was also adapted from another play written by Letts.<br /><br />My only quibbles with Killer Joe as a film are a couple of scenes that went on a bit too long - most particularly the chicken-leg scene - which I felt diminished their over-the-top impact rather than enhanced it.  I also felt the take-the-camera-and-run ending was a tad too abrupt and not really satisfying.  The ending could definitely have used just a bit more, like one more telling line from Dottie, to round things out.  Other reviews have mentioned this but in the end you'll have to judge for yourself.<br /><br />But these quibbles aside, Killer Joe succeeds in being a near-masterpiece of dark comedy and Southern Gothic drive-in/grindhouse art.  While definitely not for everyone, it is, I feel, a must-see film for anyone who likes their comedy truly dark and over-the-top disturbing beyond any boundaries of nicety.his own desperation.

B0034G4P4O|5.0|Although created by the Belgian Georges Remi alias Hergé, Tintin has been adopted by France as one of its national heroes and figureheads, along with Asterix the Gaul and... Lucky Luke the cowboy and bounty-hunter, \\"the man who shoots faster than his shadow\\". President De Gaulle once said that he was the second most famous Frenchman after Tintin, and Tintin is very much part of every Frenchman's culture, old or young, an equivalent maybe of the Marvel and DC superheroes for Americans. In fact I think Tintin may be even more a part of French culture than the superheroes to American culture, because it is part not only of popular culture but also of high-browed culture: intellectuals, university professors or a President de la République can (and should) profess to be Tintin nuts with no shame (one of the favorite games is to mention as many possible of Capitaine Haddock's insults - dictionaries have been written on that). A term has even been coined for us: \\"Tintinophiles\\". Everybody's a Tintinophile in France, except some foreigners. There once was a weekly comics magazine in France named after Tintin (that's where the new Hergé stories were first published, in two-page instalments if I recall), whose slogan was \\"the magazine for the youths from 7 to 77\\". Well, now, based on my own experience with my kids and the increase in life expectancy, make it \\"5 to 105\\". Maybe my parents' generation wasn't as infatuated with Tintin as mine, because comics were still then suspiciously regarded as a subculture for kids, but I see with my own kids that Tintin still \\"works\\" on their generation as it did with mine. And it is not just nostalgia for one's childhood. Reading again all those Tintin albums to my kids, sure, the earlier ones chronologically can be embarrassingly naive and sometimes even irritatingly dumb - Tintin in Congo, Tintin in America (but this one has this breathtaking page, just one page, where you see the native Indians chased by the army from their reservation after oil has been discovered, and a modern skyscraping city built in a day - America summarized in one page), Cigars of the Pharaoh, The Blue Lotus. There are still some naïve twists of scenario in The Broken Ear, the Crab with the Golden Claws and The Shooting Star that liken them to kids literature, but with The Black Island and King Ottokar's Scepter the stories are so masterfully conceived not just in drawing but in script also that they liken Hergé to a great movie director, for young AND old - like Spielberg. And all the others, from The Secret of the Unicorn to Flight 714 to Sidney, are true masterpieces. I hadn't liked the latter so much when it first came out at the end of the 1960s. Re-reading it now, I think it is one of the best (among many \\"best ones\\").<br /><br />So, given the importance and prevalence of Tintin in French culture, and knowing what the cinema usually does with pre-existing literature it adapts - betray it - the Spielberg-Hergé encounter was an affair fraught with risk, at least for those steeped in the Tintin culture, which is probably not the case of most American viewers. In fact (and I may be here a minority opinion among French high-browed culturists) I think the film is great, because it realizes a great transmission of the relay baton between the universe of Hergé and the universe of Spielberg, the world of comics and that of film.<br /><br />First, there is the decision to use motion capture technique, and I think the visual result perfectly symbolizes that bridging between comics and film, with an image too artificial and slick to be \\"real\\" motion picture, but too \\"real\\" to be animation. Second, the film's very beginning explicitly and wittingly stages that transmission between Hergé and Spielberg. You are, as in the album The Secret of the Unicorn, at the Brussels flea market (I don't think the city is designated, but if you have a little Tintin culture, you know), but unlike the album it starts with a street draftsman doing a portrait of Tintin. And the penciled portrait furiously resembles the Tintin of the comics. The draftsman speaks with an unmistakable Belgian accent, and when the film shows his face: it is Hergé, and he says (I'm mentioning the line from memory here), \\"hey, something gives me the impression that I've drawn you many times already\\". Isn't that clever.<br /><br />In fact, everything is clever about the adaptation. Very clever is the conflation of two Tintin albums, The Secret of the Unicorn (Part I of Red Rackham's Treasure, which centers around Captain Haddock) and the Crab with The Golden Claws, which stages the first appearance in the Tintin series of Captain Haddock, and the transitions between both stories are brilliantly and seamlessly managed. (Incidentally everybody comments that the script also draws on Red Rackham's Treasure,the sequel of The Secret of the Unicorn, but in fact it hardly does, see below). VERY clever is to have turned what is a secondary character in the album, the collector Sakharin, into a very descendant of Red Rackham (and indeed there is a physical similarity between the two, of which Hergé failed to do anything - or maybe he meant it as a red herring, a false trail), the pendant of Captain Haddock with his ancestor François de Haddocque. Some critics (and some of my Tintinophile friends) have taken exception with the final battle of cranes between Haddock and Sakharin, finding it too much Hollywood action blockbuster and not enough Tintin. I think they are entirely wrong and that there is something they didn't catch: that the battle of cranes between the two scions is the pendant and modern transcription in today's technology of the battle of sabers that opposed the two ancestors; it is a brilliant invention of Spielberg and his scriptwriters, and again the symbol of that passing of the relay baton between Hergé and Spielberg.<br /><br />My only frustration is the ending: The Secret of the Unicorn was only the introductionto the frustrated hunt for Red Rackham's Treasure, which took Tintin, Haddock and Professor Calculus (making his first apparition on that occasion, but sadly absent from the film) all the way to the Caribbean, and a great illustration of the dictum that one doesn't need to search the hidden treasures at the world's end when they are in one's garden. In the film, because obviously Spielberg wanted it to end on a closed- rather than an open-ending, there is no \\"false track\\" and the ending feels very abrupt.<br /><br />And then, other than all these clever twists of script-writing, there is the magnificent art of Spielberg the film-maker. I haven't always been enthusiastic with Spielberg's film-making, finding it a little too block-bustering and aimed at the wider public to allow for as much subtlety and shadows as I would have liked. But here, I find the visual imagination grandiose. The way a Sahara sand dune morphs into a 17th-century galleon on a stormy sea is a breathtaking visual moment.
145162607X|5.0|I have read every \\"royal\\" novel that Phillipa Gregory has written, and I am very much enjoying seeing the War of the Roses from all the points of view. Sometimes it can be hard because its natural to pick one side or the other, and it can be hard to sympathize with the opposing side. Gregory does an amazing job of painting a realistic and sympathetic account from each woman's point of view. I find it very interesting to essentially read the exact same event from each point of view in the various novels. I had never really considered Anne Neville before as a main heroine. I always thought of it as a war between Margaret and Elizabeth Woodville- the Red and White Queens. I had never understood the lifelong rivalry and anger between Anne and Elizabeth's families. It was well written and intriguing, and not the typical account.<br /><br />My only complaint is that sometimes it felt like there wasn't a strong sense of WHO Anne was, meaning her personality. That and at the very end of the story, when Anne simply accepts the Princess Elizabeth and doesn't fight her at all seemed odd to me. Anne spent her whole life trying to get the throne and keep it from the Woodvilles, I dont understand why she would be so accepting of allowing Princess Elizabeth Woodville back into court the way she did.<br /><br />Other than that, I enjoyed the book, thought it was a great addition, can't wait for the next one, and would recommend it to others.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|Lead reviewer Michael Acuna writes that \\"Chapter 11 of Genesis tells a story of mankind's attempt to reach heaven by building a tower, not as a way to glorify God but as a way for mankind to glorify themselves by putting them on God's level. God strikes the plan down by confusing/creating different languages so that the builders cannot understand each other thereby suspending communication.\\"<br /><br />Interestingly, Chapter 11 of Genesis does NOT say that:<br /><br />\\"1. And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.<br /><br />2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.<br /><br />3. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.<br /><br />4. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.<br /><br />5. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.<br /><br />6. And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.<br /><br />7. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.<br /><br />8. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.<br /><br />9. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\\"<br /><br />Nowhere does the text explicitly say that the building of the tower was a way for mankind to glorify themselves rather than God. It explicitly says that it was a way to \\"reach unto heaven\\". Isn't that what religious people, mystics, try and do: get closer to God? But we have been so accustomed, for centuries and millenia, to being told and believing that God sent onto mankind the confusion of languages to strike down mankind's arrogance and pride, that we don't even read any more what the text explicitly says. And that name, \\"Babel\\". In translation the text of the Bible is pretty cryptic here: \\"Therefore is the name of it called Babel\\". Babel was presumably Babylon, but the author of the text draws a reconstructed etymology from the Hebrew \\"bâlal\\", to jumble, to confuse. But Bab-el meant \\"The Gate to God\\"...<br /><br />What the text explicitly says (provided that King James' translation is accurate, I haven't specifically researched), is that the reason for God to strike mankind down was the concern that \\"now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do\\". Like: the fruit of knowledge was enough knowledge. Let's prevent them from knowing more, and thus coming closer to Me.<br /><br />If confusion of languages was part of God's plan, should we burn at the stake Merriam, Webster, every dictionary and translation and inventor of translation softwares, and even King James and every translated Bible? I've never seen any religious biggot (I know, it isn't the proper spelling, but I like the similitude with \\"maggot\\") advocate that, and I find religious biggots very inconsistent here.<br /><br />If the reasons for God sending upon mankind the confusion of languagues was (as the text explicitly says) to prevent mankind from doing just anything \\"which they have imagined to do\\", should artists, novelists, scientists, inventors, architects, all those that for centuries and millenia have tried to turn their imagination into reality, made possible the impossible, built real or metaphorical skycrapers and worked for the betterment of the life of mankind, be burnt at the stake? I don't think even the worst religious biggots advocate it (although, some, maybe...)and I find them very inconsistent here.<br /><br />Or maybe not. I've always found it strange that God should send strife and confusion among mankind (and what it begets, and what the film is about: misunderstanding, fear, violence, war). Isn't strife, confusion, fear and violence a thing of the Devil, rather than of God? Oh but yes: the Devil is also part of God's plan. And what's the plan? Keep mankind into submission, prey of death, malady, ignorance, fear; keep mankind into its condition of mankind, despite the unfortunate ingestion of the forbidden fruit. God is a ruler jealous of his power. In fact he's never accepted to share it with anyone, and unlike Stalin and Mao, he is eternal.<br /><br />Or maybe He just wants to be left alone, undisturbed, and thus closes all the Gates to Him that mankind tries to open.<br /><br />Oh, and, from reading the text of the Bible with pre-conceptions rather than reading it for what it explicitly says, we also forget that Babel is not just about the division and confusion of languages: it is also about mankind being \\"scattered abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth\\". That too is part of the Plan. Burn Freddy Laker and American Airlines at the stake.<br /><br />Iñárritu's \\"Babel\\" is a powerful film. Maybe it is a film \\"about\\" the difficulty to communicate - a nowhere more than in its \\"Japan\\" thread, with its deaf-mute heroin. But other than that it is not the theme I find the most prominent. It is also, evidentely, a film about mankind being scattered on the surface of the earth (and as close as San Diego to Tijuana can be as far as Morocco from Tokyo), about borders and crossing them.<br /><br />Some negative commentators seem to think that it rambles, that its four threads are only loosely connected. Well - maybe, but if so, it is just like life itself. It is NOT always the mechanical unfolding of a preconceived and tightly-wrought plan. It rambles and glides along sinuous roads, as the touring bus on the smallMoroccan mountain road, it takes its time and feasts as in a Mexican wedding, but that's only the spring slowly winding up (and you know it is winding up, which fills even these scenes with breathless tension, because you don't know exactly where the blow will come from), and suddently fate strikes. Iñárritu's film hits you in the stomach like a fist blow. His actors are so real - I'm not talking here only of stars Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchet and Gael Garcia Bernal (and they are great; Pitt proves that he can be a real actor, not just a cardboard clowning caricature as in Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds), but all the others, the Moroccans, the Mexican nanny (Adriana Barraza), all the way to the smallest roles, the American border guard, the Moroccan shepperds, guide, police - that it is unbelievable. How do you get non-professional, teen-age Moroccan actors to play so realistically in scenes that would seem to be anathema to Muslim culture? Is there a subsidiary of the Actor's Studio in Rabat? I found the scene of the Mexican nanny lost in the desert with the two kids almost unbearable - I had to stop a few minutes, go pee, take a bite, any pretext to relieve the tension. But I returned.<br /><br />The film is called \\"Babel\\" but I think the title may be somewhat misleading, and that there is another secret thread running through it. I once read an interview of an ex-convict turned philosopher, and he had this aphorism which imprinted on my memory. Paraphrasing Sartre, he said: \\"hell is not \\"the others\\": hell is causality\\". I think \\"Babel\\" is about that too. How small, inconsequential decisions will bear unanticipated, fateful, unescapable consequences. The ancient Greeks called it \\"Fate\\".<br /><br />This is a real director, and this is real cinema, not entertainment.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this trilogy for my 11 year old daughter.  She finished the entire collection with 10-14 days.  She loved it!!  I am going to read it next.  What a great collection and the price was great as well!!!
B002AF4Y9G|1.0|I went back and re watched this so called \\"director's cut\\"..and what may have been groundbreaking in the mid 90's, is an utter mess and bad today.. I wouldn't call this a classic in any sense of the word.. Reservoir Dogs (made be4 NBK) is a classic...<br /><br />It's interesting to note that back in the days of VHS, when releasing unrated versions by big studios wasn't a common practice, allegedly, Warner Bros. refused to release the director's cut because of the \\"then\\" controversial violence (actually, I'd like to think they thought the movie sucked and were too embarrassed by how awful the film is).. thus forcing Regency and O.Stone to take the uncut film to (then) Trimark, now Lions Gate...But today, Warner Bros. and all of the Majors would be releasing the urated director's cut... Times have changed..and that's a good thing.. 20 years later and the film is not shocking, it's just whiny, wallows and shows how silly we are as a society.. and nowadays, people, like this don't have to act out, because they can just go on Springer, Maury or one of the other awful trashy afternoon talk shows and work it out in their segment(s)...

0307730697|5.0|If you can find a better read than \\"Fearless\\" you better latch on to it.  I've read so many books about the military over the last ten years that they tend to run together but this is in a class by itself.  Twenty stars wouldn't do this justice.  I've read it twice and will read it again and again over the years.  This isn't about the details of SEAL training or combat.  Its about the life of a young man who literally went from valley to mountaintop.  Military men and women give us all an example of determined self sacrifice (just the opposite of politicians) but what Adam did throughout his life was on another level.  What a man, what a story, what a read.
0307951529|5.0|In The $100 Startup, Chris Guillebeau provides a wealth of examples of people who have ventured outside the traditional career paths laid forth before them and developed businesses that supported them without morally bankrupting them. The author does not paint the picture of an easy-to-follow get rich scheme, but instead shows how people from different backgrounds all over the world have achieved financial security through hard work, an innovative spirit and relatively humble beginnings. When I read the book, light bulbs started going off in my head, and ideas for monetizing my passions bubbled to the surface like never before.<br /><br />If you have an entrepreneurial spirit or are just tired of going through the motions in your current career path, I invite you to spend some time with The $100 Startup. Keep a notebook handy to capture the ideas that spring forth and be ready to take action on them as soon as possible. Although the book shows how multiple people have achieved financial security by starting their own businesses, none of them did it passively. Success requires action, but thankfully this book inspires action every step of the way.

But I think it will work for A LOT of people.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I thought this book was good because I had nothing to compare it to.  After read other novels similar to this subject matter, this book is really just not that well written.  CAPTIVE IN THE DARK series is a much better read and the Anastasia character of this book is not annoying.  I did NOT like Anastasia at all.  The book would have been better if it was written in Christian's point of view.

B00095NX9G|3.0|This is a good dvd . Rachel brice is a very elegant dancer .<br />It did take me a little while to figure out how to use the video .<br />It confused me a little because of how the video is set up . I had a hard time<br />finding the instructional part of the video . I have been bellydancing for two years now . Although I am not I tribal fusion dancer ;I still found this dvd very helpful. The first videos starts with yoga ; then it gets into the instructional part where it starts of easy ,but it does get more intence torwards the end ;then it goes to a shimmy drill ,and ends with yoga again . The secend video teaches the coreography then ends with yoga . I do believe that this video is good for intermediate and advanced dancers only . If you are a sirius dancer , then this dvd is for you . Even if you aren't a tribal fusion dancer this video is still fun ,and still has alout of classic bellydance moves . I have yet to master this dvd ; as I have only used it once so far . It can be hard to keep up with at times . It is good to pause it if you cannot follow along fast enough . Just go to your own pace and practice when you mess up . She does alout of layering that was very hard for me ,and the shimmy drill is hard to keep up with also . The two coreographies are short , but can also be a little complex for an intermediate . I only gave this dvd three stars because it was a little confusing how to start of<br /> with it . I do wish she would have explaned how to do a belly roll more . She didn't realy break that down realy well , but I do recommend this video to anyone who is interested in it . I may have forggoten a few other details about the video , but enjoy .
B007L6VQHW|4.0|I really enjoy the HBO series that sometimes drags a bit much, but this movie covers drama and action so well in just two hours. Three brothers from Virginia in 1931 earn all of their money from bootlegging. But of course, the mob and the local state officials want their cut as well. This leads to a bunch of killing. You know the drill here, but the cast somehow made this material seem fresh.<br /><br />All of the actors are great. Tom Hardy (Mr. Bane himself) and Guy Pearce put on acting showcases here. Really good stuff. Heck, even Shia LaBeouf turned in his best performance of his career. I could actually stand him. Jessica Chastain holds her own with the guys and has a nude scene that I wasn't expecting, but no complaints.<br /><br />There was bloody violence, humor and sex all wrapped up in a nicely flawed, but throughly enjoyable package. Like I said, nothing really new here, but if you enjoy gangster films there is much to appreciate in Lawless. It's one of my favorite movies of the year so far.
B008602KQI|3.0|A prologue to better establish the situation would have helped.  I had a lot of questions as I watched the first half of the movie - like why don't the desperately \\"hungry\\" children appear more emaciated, especially the cherub-cheeked star.  My wife had read the book so she answered most of my questioning looks (e.g. \\"Katniss and her family benefited from her hunting prowess\\").  Thought \\"Katniss\\" was \\"Katnip\\" for a while - disappointed it wasn't. In the end, it was shades of Schwarzenegger's \\"Running Man\\" SILLY game show shtick, \\"Truman Show\\" game control room shtick, and a host of \\"survival\\" shtick movies - nothing really new here and really just another bit of a CGI heavy, teenager-centric, overrated time-passer.  Explains its unexplainable popularity, I guess.
0307744434|4.0|Some authors focus on character, some on plot. Erin Morgenstern presents these elements well in her book THE NIGHT CIRCUS, but she also relies on a fictional element that get dumped on in contemporary literature: description. But is that such a bad thing?<br /><br />Morgenstern uses description to create mood in this story and I believe it's necessary. Much of the magical elements rely upon the five senses. Description can slow down the narrative, but the author gives just enough to carry the reader through the scene. Yes, the amount of description may be reminiscent of literature from the nineteenth century, but that's the time period in which the story occurs. I felt it gave the story the appropriate flavor.<br /><br />When you get down to it, how \\"slow\\" or fast\\" paced a story feels to the reader is subjective. While I understand why some may find THE NIGHT CIRCUS slow at certain parts, I enjoyed it overall.

0345803485|1.0|Apart from the atrocious writing and repetitiveness, the simplistic and very unerotic story line and foolish stick-figure characterizations are so over the top ridiculous that the speed of this easy read is totally devoid of pleasure.

0060975768|4.0|Like most people, I have seen the 2002 movie \\"We Were Soldiers\\" starring Mel Gibson. This movie was directly inspired from Lt. Colonel Hal Moore's book. I was greatly impressed by that movie and I expected a lot from this book that I finally got around to read.<br /><br />I can say I have not been disappointed, although to be honest this book is not written to be a war thriller, a frantic page-turner such as Phase Green or Hamburger Hill. This book is mostly about a precise, richly detailed description of what was the first major engagement in Vietnam of the mythic First Cavalry division. About two thirds of the book is devoted to the three tense, bloody days that Lt.Col. Moore's battalion spent at landing zone X-Ray in the Central Mountains of South Vietnam. It is a story as harrowing as it can be and you can only feel deep, sober respect and admiration for what the soldiers endured there, and the unflinching leadership the military commanders demonstrated. Not only Lt. Col. Moore, but also the other company commanders of the battalion showed great courage and skills during those 3 days.<br /><br />But the third and last part of the book actually covers a much less known battle involving another battalion of the First Cav that immediately followed the ordeal of Lt.Col. Moore's soldiers at X-Ray. This one happened at landing zone Albany, and it was an unspeakable tragedy that did not end as a victory such as the fight at X-Ray. Led by Lt.Col. McDade, this battalion was basically wiped out when it get caught, more or less willingly, into a trap setup by the North Vietnamese. Strung out in a long line of march over a couple of hundred yards in unprepared positions, all companies separated from their commanders who were gathered with McDade for a situation conference, and woefully surprised by the savage enemy assault, McDade's battalion was promptly exterminated. I found the story of what happened much more distressing than the battle at X-Ray as there was no escaping from the utter massacre. It is painful to read.<br /><br />In conclusion, I was fascinated by the destiny of one of the main protagonists of the story, Rick Rescorla, who was platoon leader at the time. He is one of the few people who actually got involved in both X-Ray and Albany battles as he was with B Company, 2nd Battaltion, First Cav, which participated in both battles. He not only managed to survive but he also accounted for himself in stellar fashion during the battle, showing great resolve and leadership. He is actually the man portrayed on the cover of the vintage edition of the book. But wait: incredibly enough, he was also at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, 36 years later as Security Manager for brokerage firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He successfully oversaw the evacuation of most of the firm's employees this morning and died a tragic death when he went back in WTC Tower 2 to help out others still inside and the tower then collapsed. This man was truly made of the stuff of heroes, and Once We Were Soldiers is what it is all about.from the utter massacre.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This provides decent protection for my Kindle Fire, which is really the first and foremost requirement. So far, it seems to meet that pretty well.<br /><br />My few reservations about it include the lack of a place to store a stylus pen (if you have a stylus that works with the Fire, shouldn't there be a convenient place to keep it?), the difference between each model of the Kindle with consequent lack of interchangeability in the case (I guess not really a fault of the case maker).<br /><br />I guess the bottom line is that this case is a pretty good value for the money.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I want the original three films with no alterations warts and all.  I do not understand why this is so hard to do.  Take the negative (or a good print).  Scan it.  Put it on blu-ray.  There is obviously a market for this.  Don't they want to take my money?
0345803507|1.0|I fell for the hype about this trilogy on Facebook and didn't read the reviews. My bad!! The three books could have been condensed into one with no loss to the story line. With that said, I kept waiting for the mind boggling twist that never came, unlike the two main characters in this series.  The story was unendingly repetitious right through to the end of the 3rd book to the point that you, the reader, were saying to yourself, \\"not again!\\"  The only part I thought was clever/amusing were the comments from the heroine's subconscious and inner goddess. If you are interested in BDSM and want to learn of a few ways to spice up your sex life, then go for it, but don't expect to put this series down with a feeling of \\"Wow, that was a great read!\\".

145162607X|4.0|Admittedly I haven't read a Philippa Gregory novel for quite some time but it didn't take long for me to remember why I love her books so much.<br />The vividly rich way with which Philippa Gregory lovingly describes her settings, characters and their stories is simply beautiful - she carries the reader back to those times, bringing to life what would otherwise be vague moments of history left mostly forgotten the past 600 plus years, and The Kingmaker's Daughter is another prime example of her wondrous writing.<br /><br />Anne Neville is a fiercely loyal daughter to her father, an obedient servant to her mother and fiercely protective towards her sister. But when pushed aside one too many times and left abandoned and betrayed by those charged with her care, Anne turns to herself for salvation; and in doing so discovers that she can make her own future.<br />The story of Anne Neville is one of great determination born of an upbringing filled with broken treaties, forced alliances and deceit - an almost constant life of uncertainty.<br /><br />Written with Philippa Gregory's unique vibrancy, the scenes painted so clearly and colorfully in ones mind's eye, that you are immediately swept into this harsh and contrived world of royalty and politics. While many subplots and other historical figures play a large role in the telling of Anne's story, the author keeps true the book title by following Anne from her lowest of low points, to the fruition of her father's ultimate dream - a Neville on the throne.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Philippa Gregory's fictional retelling of actual events in history, her characters are always vibrant and charismatic even when forced to do unspeakable acts.<br />Philippa Gregory skilfully weaves her stories into books I have come to cherish; they are some, if not the best factual historical novels I have read - she is a master storyteller.<br />The Kingmaker's Daughter is decadent 4 Star read

B006LSZECO|1.0|I won't give any of the plot away or give spoilers, as some readers did enjoy this story; however, I will say I detested both main characters by the end & was mad at myself for trudging through when my instincts told me to quit reading shortly after starting this book.
B0060YIBLK|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, and thinking about the tips for drawing out people. The point-of-view is too much on the manipulative side for my taste. I continually reminded myself that it is due to the author's profession as an FBI profiler and spy recruiter - different than my orientation towards the subject matter, mostly focused on being a better friend and listener! On the other hand, as a marketing professional, it can be helpful and instructive to get deep into individuals' mindsets whom we encounter, so in the end, my thinking about the advice as also important in that respect helped reconcile my interests with the author's.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|First, ignore the featured review from Jedd Beaudoin.  His lukewarm attitude to \\"From Beale Street to Oblivion\\" is puzzling and totally inaccurate.  Clutch have brought us a logical follow-up to \\"Robot Hive/Exodus\\", meaning big riffs, maybe some of the best Tim Sult has produced on any Clutch album, smoky keyboards and Neal Fallon's usual brand of lyrics, meaning funny and smart and a sense of levity I didn't quite expect.<br />  The guitars are a bit bigger this time around, and the hooks are worthy of the best of any classic rock out there, be it Zeppelin or any riff oriented band.  There exists the slightest hint of southern rock, primarily due to the organs but overall \\"From Beale Street to Oblivion\\" is an album that should have been huge and appealed to those reluctant to listen to anything that doesn't sound like their precious 1970's.  Maybe we can call it retro, but somehow Clutch make their music as vital and current as anybody without sounding derivative.<br />  There also exists a level of energy that takes us back to \\"Blast Tyrant\\", thus mending the bluesier elements of their latter career with the heaviest riffs of their earlier stuff.  Regardless, it's a must have for any Clutch fan.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|A lot of &quot;utility&quot; apps  get in the way by insisting that they be on top and provide needless information.<br /><br />THIS APP is different. It comes on when you turn on your Kindle Fire or plug in the charger or unplug it. To the point, it only puts itself forward when there is a change in the battery condition.<br /><br />The tiny bubbles in the blue battery icon indicate that charging is taking place. A small redundancy when the charging icon at top right of the Fire display already tell you that.

0307744434|5.0|I have never read a book quite like this.  Each page is like some sort of wonderful and elaborate mythical revelation.  Truly magical. I found myself dying to see the night circus in my town!  I found the characters to be lovable, I spent every chapter cheering for them.  The ending was a little disappointing, but that just adds to the likeablity of the novel.  The great books never really end the way you want them too!<br /><br />I am counting days until someone decides that this book needs to be a movie! I truly believe the theatrics of this book would translate so well into a movie.  I don't think I've ever said that before about a book.  I'm also counting days until Morgenstern comes up with a second masterpiece. Hopefully its as magical as this novel was for me!
B006GECE9Y|2.0|Update corrupts the reinstall. Was working fine until Amazon app store said an update was available. The update unistalled old version then started reinstall. I authorized the app and it started install then hung with error code that it couldn't be installed.
0307957934|2.0|I usually love techno-thrillers, but wow did I have a hard time reading The Fear Index. I never cared about the characters, because after the first part, I was tired of hearing about him already and how rich he was. The book got a little better, but there were too many things I didn't enjoy reading, and while I won't give away the end, the other main \\"character\\" doesn't seem as smart as it should be. I finished the book...barely. It just wasn't something I found myself wanting to finish reading.
B005S9EL6C|5.0|If you take this movie story line for what it is, I can safely say I enjoyed this movie more than any I've seen recently.  Others say it's wierd that the \\"Mob\\" starts dancing in odd times and places, but isn't that what this movie is about?  I didn't see anything wrong with the acting; the story was fine. I just absolutely loved the dancing scenes. It was fun that the movie started with the 'kids' doing a performance art dance in the middle of the street. And I loved the costumes they wore when they danced in the office scene.

B004FA8NOQ|5.0|i installed the 2600k 2 months ago and it has been powering my machine since.  It keeps cool, about 34 C with a Coolermaster 212.  I have it booting to a light overclock, 4.0 GHz with no issues. The eight cores do not help much for games, compared to an i5, but the extra cores have been really helpful with 3D CAD software.  I have 8 GB of Ripjaw and an OCZ Vertex 4 SSD and the system is blazing fast.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I have never read such a vulgar book before. The content is pornographic and tries to portray Mr Grey as the hero, while describing a very damaged individual requiring serious psychological intervention. The writing is awful and the story is non-existent.<br />I consider both my money and my time wasted. If this is the kind of book that gets onto the New York bestsellers list I don't have much respect for that list anymore. I will never read another book by E.L.James again.It is not worth the paper it is printed on.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I am a major fan of \\"Where's My Water\\".  After playing it twice through, I downloaded \\"Where's My Perry\\" as I was greedy for more.  It proved to be enjoyable, but not on the same caliber as \\"Where's My Water\\".  It was a bit easier, and somewhat confusing.  Had I found this game first though, I'd probably have rated it 5 stars.

1475143389|5.0|BLS is one of the best program/books that I have ever read. The author Michael Matthews is very informative about his approach to the body building game and is easy to relate to because he seems like just an average guy. The Ultimate Goal for anyone doing any sort of weight training is to achieve a Bigger Leaner Stronger physique, and this book shows you exactly how to do that. For someone who knows nothing about lifting or nutrition, the book breaks down as far as to what the definition of a calorie is. As far as i'm concerned for the diet aspect of the program, it is all anyone really needs to know and the concepts of bulking, cutting and maintaining are easy enough for anyone to grasp. As for the lifting program, it goes back to the basics, nothing fancy, nothing revolutionary, but going back to compound movements at a high intensity week by week and adding weight to the bar or reps each training session. By becoming stronger (adding more weight) you will thus see improvements in muscle mass and body composition. I would definitely recommend this program to anyone at any age or experience in training. I would also suggest that if you have any questions at all to email Mike (the author) he responded to me within 24 hours he is very knowledgeable and seems like a good guy who cares about the people he is helping with achieving the physique of their dreams.
B00005NWM3|5.0|It is as if Nickelback's eccentric front man, Chad Kroeger, has swallowed John Lennon, Robert Plant and Jim Morrison and channels their spirits into one magnificent vocal sound that is incomparable in today's musical landscape.  Their lyrics on the newest album reflect a much darker mood and it takes the listener multiple spins of the CD before you can even begin to decipher the emotional breadth.  Maybe not since Creed's \\"Weathered\\" has an album been so grandiose, so introspective, so magically mind-compeling that you literally feel each individual goosebump rise off your tattered and shredded skin that has been caused by the intense and Hendrix-like guitar riffs.  The drums and bass seem to almost dance with one another, but unlike Cinderella, these guys wont be arriving in a pumpkin shaped wagon or wear glass slippers.  Think rocket-ships bound for the outer reaches of the solar system and a pair of 1960's Vietnam style marching boots.
1594744769|3.0|This was, as most people have already stated, completely not what I was expecting (i.e., it's not weird and creepy). It's a wanna be with creepy photos and a rather bland plot. However, I still appreciate the novelty of this book within the context of the young adult book market. For me, it's the first of it's kind and for that, it deserves its props.<br /><br />The reason I picked this up wasn't because I'm extremely interested in horror (even though it turned out to not be one) but because I had heard the writing was above average. When I read a review before purchasing it, the excerpt they posted seemed a few notches above other YA authors. However, I kept reading it waiting for the same glimmer I saw in that small excerpt throughout the rest of the book and was left wanting.<br /><br />As for the plot, while having an original concept, I found it to be very slowly paced. I was being dragged along listening to the whining of the depressed main character with a few shakeups here and there. Also when I got to the end, I found out it was part of a series (based on the cover I was led to believe it was a stand alone book as it does not say book 1 or anything of the like). I don't know if authors are being encouraged to drag their stories out these days or not, but I think this book suffered for it.<br /><br />The pictures (the main attraction of this book), while interesting, didn't add that much to the story. Sometimes they were awkwardly spaced where I had to keep going back and forth between pages to see who they were. Moreover, the pictures didn't really do anything other than act as a gimmick. I may have appreciated it more if I hadn't read \\"Extremely Loud, Incredibly Close\\" or \\"House of Leaves.\\" Both books have more seamlessly integrated the visuals into the story line so that they enhance the story itself, not just the look of the book (as in the case of Miss Peregrine). If you take away the pictures, I wonder if this book would be nearly as popular.<br /><br/>So interesting concept- yes, execution- not so great. I will not be purchasing the next book in this series but I would still recommend people check this book out. Although I didn't care for it, I can definitely see why others might.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is a gifted storyteller.  11/22/63 is a remarkable effort and one of his strongest efforts since Hearts in Atlantis.<br /><br />Back in the day, I used to pass on King, but no longer.<br /><br />11/22/63 is a compelling read.  King's characters are fully dimensionalized, his imagery is effective and his narrative is compelling.<br /><br />Don't let the bulk of the book discourage you and get reading -- you'll be glad you did.
B008220CFG|3.0|This was okay.  But Raimi fans will find no Drag Me to Hell gross-out gore and generally horror fans will not see original scenes (regarding scares), provocative possession behavior, or unique plot elements.  The newer you are to the genre (or, possession or demon box movies, per se) the more you will enjoy this finely prepared, but under-seasoned meal.  While perfectly competent for a horror, let's call it the \\"Diet Coke\\" of exorcism; a series of missed opportunities and pulled punches.<br /><br />Clyde (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick), Em[ily] (Natasha Calis) and her older sister are a family recently sundered by a rather civil divorce.  But when young Em becomes fond of an antique puzzle box she finds at a yard sale things start to get strange.  Em becomes temperamental, graduating to obsessive about the box while apathetic (even sociopathic) of the needs or wants of others.  Clyde begins to suspect a malevolent force is at work and seeks the aid of the Hasidic elders, from whom we learn about demons (or dibbuks), their specially crafted, imprisoning boxes, and exorcism.<br /><br />Most truly impressive was our young Natasha Calis as Em.  She did an amazing job showing us that as the demon commanded more and more of her conscious self (to the point of entirety) that underneath she was aware of her uncharacteristic, marionetted actions.  Her expressive eyes were the key.  Somehow malevolent on the possessed outside, while only thinly veiling the sadness and desperation of the scared child trapped within behind the evil veneer.  As her desperate and fearful father, Jeffrey Dean Morgan also does a spectacular job as the serial-recipient of her cold, lifeless gazes.  But all of this amazing tone contributed to only minor tension with no real follow-through.  The scares really weren't there for me--not even a bit, short of being taken off guard by blaring loud noises which, while a classic tactic, should come with a little more than just a lone, pounding instrumental note.  I feel like they pulled too many punches--or simply didn't have the muscle to throw them in the first place.  No exorcism should be devoid of offensive material, but this movie was completely inoffensive.  This is really like an Exorcist-lite movie; the \\"Diet Coke\\" of exorcism movies; a series of missed opportunities or, perhaps even, a Disney-appropriate version of The Exorcist.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however. That is, unless, you enjoy R-rated horror movies.  Some PG-13's pull it off--this one didn't.<br /><br />The only truly unique moment of the film was a brief scene of moths hurricaning around Em's bedroom.  Everything else has been done before--not that I'm suggesting it's easy to produce something you've never seen in a horror flick nowadays.  The exorcism scene in the end is stunningly similar, even copied, to that of The Unborn (2008), as is the general Jewish demon premise (with a few tweaks).<br /><br />To the seasoned viewer, this film might come off as at least a little bit boring when the filmmakers aren't trying to scare you with loud noises (and little clout to back them).  I kept feeling a bit of the Sam Raimi vibe, but just when I thought it would hit with something shocking, gastro-intestinally gross and gory, or totally twisted--it wouldn't happen!  Instead I just got dirty Ring-Grudge hands, a swarm zombie moths, whited-out \\"possessed\\" eyes, and a bunch of child-gone-wrong temper tantrums.  There were also some significant plot holes--not that that's a surprise in a horror film--which didn't even get a nod.  For example, something awful happens to Stephanie's boyfriend and he vanishes from the movie, then everyone behaves as if he was never there whereas earlier he was playing a father-replacement role much to Clyde's chagrin.  Then there was the fact that there was a horribly bandaged woman in the house where they bought the dibbuk box--ever think to go ask them about it before turning to obscure experts?I saw the ending coming from a mile away but, as a serious horror fan, I still appreciated the oft-told ominous closing message.<br /><br />In the end this was a perfectly competent, well-acted horror film with a less common spin on a quite common story.  A little too light for my taste, but heavy-handed horror and sacrilegious scenarios are not for everyone.  If you are \\"not everyone\\" then maybe this very PG possession movie is for you.<br /><br />SIDBAR:  This movie is a slightly different take on The Unborn (2009), in which Odette Annabel/Yustman is plagued by her unborn Dibbuk demon twin--not The Unborn (1991), in which a woman has a mutant, murderous baby a la It's Alive (1974, 2008 remake).  On that note, let's just snuff out the fact that sooo many people are thrilled to see \\"this new take\\" on \\"the first Jewish exorcism\\" movie.  It's not.  It's at least the second and is basically a reboot with some scenes remade from The Unborn.  This movie is also in no way related to the ultra-weird and cerebral Possession (1981, with Sam Neil).<br /><br />BIPOLAR REVIEWS:  Hop on to IMDB as scan the already numerous reviews and you'll find that everyone is loving or loathing this flick.  My guess is that the loathers have seen far more horror flicks than the lovers.I saw the ending coming from a mile away but, as a serious horror fan, I still appreciated the oft-told ominous closing message.<br /><br />In the end this was a perfectly competent, well-acted horror film with a less common spin on a quite common story.

031620157X|5.0|I actually bought this book because Chris has written it. I had low expectations, but it did not take many pages before I was completely hooked. It's a wonderful story that should be read by everyone. It is marketed as a children's book, but I believe that everyone can and should read it. Chris shows an amazing ability to understand how other people feel and why they do what they do. I do not know how he manages to put together so many fairy tales so organic, but it's an honor to read this book.
B001NLL93W|5.0|WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!!<br /><br />In City of Glass, we find ourselves right back where we left off. Jace, Alec, and Isabelle are heading to Alicante with Maryse and Robert Lightwood for a hearing about what to do with Valentine. Clary is supposed to join them but Jace has Simon meet him at the Institute to convince him to keep Clary in New York where it is safe. Unfortunately, even the institute isn't safe with Valentine having 2 of the 3 Mortal Instruments. In a life or death situation, Jace is forced to break the rules again and bring an injured Simon through the portal and into the Glass City. When Clary arrives at the institute a few hours later ready to see Idris for the first time she realizes something went horribly wrong. She uses her rune writing ability to create her own portal to Idris and find the friends that left her behind. Thankfully, when she arrives, Luke is there to save the day and she finds herself recuperating at Amantis' house. This book is not short on action by any means, Simon gets jailed by the new Inquisitor, we find Hodge is still alive, and Sebastian is not who he seems.<br />We see fear and pandemonium overtake the Glass City as Valentine and his demons are able to enter the city and disable the wards. He gives the Clave a choice, surrender or die. With Luke and Clary there to fight the good fight, we find out whether or not the Clave is willing to find out if an allegiance with the down worlders is a good idea or something they should fear more than Valentine's ultimate rule. What will they decide? Read \\"City of Glass,\\" the third in the Mortal Instruments Series to find out.<br />(I apologize for the short review but my fingers wanted to give away too many spoilers, it was that good.)<br /><br />Don't forget to check out the next book in the Saga, \\"City of Fallen Angels.\\"

B004QXJZXA|5.0|As most of us know, all blu-rays are not created equal. I love this movie. I have it on dvd and the video is horrible. When I saw that there was a blu-ray version available, there was no hesitation, I ordered it. When it arrived I stopped what I was doing, put the disc into the player, and hoped that this was going to be a decent blu-ray video of LeMans. As I watched the movie, I was amazed. For me the video was superb! I hope that whatever videos you decide to get will also amaze you.
0307887448|2.0|I normally don't review bad books I've read. I'd rather just ignore them. And I know I'm opening myself up to be flamed by the legions of fans the book has amassed but I'm going to say it:<br /><br />This is one of the worst books I've ever finished, certainly the worst in the last few years.<br /><br />Normally I'd also have stopped reading this book at about the 1/4 point, it was so bad up to then. But, having seen so many good reviews including recommendations from people in my social networks, I pushed on.<br /><br />So, here's the brief synopsis: everyone on earth in the near future spends all the time in some virtual reality simulation because the economy is awful, people are poor, and nations are collapsing. The creator of this virtual reality dies as one of the richest guys on earth and having no heirs, has created a huge video role playing game inside the simulation. The winner of this game inherits everything he had including ownership of the company. Wade is a poor schoolboy who spends the next several years playing this game in isolation along with millions of other people including an evil takeover corporation. The entire book is like watching (and listening to) someone playing a computer game. Complete with 80's trivia on every page. Can you name the largest Japanese anime robot? What does the hidden symbol in Rush's album cover from 1983 mean? What's the highest possible score in PacMan? Yawn.<br /><br />That's it. I kept going because at a couple of points I thought there might be some character development. I kept going because I thought people I know couldn't like a book this bad. I was wrong on both points. The characters are as lifeless as their computer simulated avatars. There is no brilliant ending like an Ender's Game classic.<br /><br />So, here's what you need to like this book: play D&D a lot and talk about it a lot too. play every computer RPG you can think of. Want to read dozens of pages talking about things like a shield of +10 protection. Have serious discussion about character motivation on BattleStar Galactica and FireFly and wonder what would happen if The Enterprise flew through a StarGate.<br /><br />Not my cup of Earl Grey. And if you don't fit the above mold, I'm going to recommend you have better things to do with your time.
