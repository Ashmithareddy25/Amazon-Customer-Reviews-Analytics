B0098VYCCE|2.0|Well, saw this and the cast involved and thought it can't be that bad- wrong. It was long, drawn out and boring as can be. Kristen Stewart was the wrong choice for this movie too- she just didn't fit the profile for the character. If you value your time, do something else.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like being able to find interesting things to repin.Especially humourous quotes and funny pics. This app has everything you could want to find.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it!!!!!! it was so much better than the first book cant wait to read the next one!!!!!!!!!!!!!I really hope we dont have to wait to long!!!!
B006S08RLU|5.0|I could watch this film over and over again. The characters, the romance, the old-fashioned modernness of Amelie make it my all-time favorite romantic movie.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This was typical Lee Child thriller writing!  There were so many twists and turns to make you not want to put the book down.  Keep up the fantastic writing, Lee Child!  I can't wait for the next Reacher book.

B002C949KE|1.0|There are some problems with this book. I'll give specific examples (there are lots of them, so I'll only give an abbreviated listing to try to keep the review readable). Some examples are by chapter and others are by page number.<br /><br />General problems:<br /><br />1. I have no doubt that this author is a bright guy, but he is not an economist. He does not do his best work when he tries to use formal economic reasoning in his service and he looks even more foolish when he tries to debunk what economists have already hashed out.<br /><br />2. The book really wanders off topic in more than a few chapters. WAY off topic. I had to remind myself several times that *this is a book about irrationality* (or at least that is what it was supposed to be).<br /><br />3. This book was written before Daniel Kahnemann's \\"[[ASIN:0374275637 Thinking, Fast and Slow]],\\" but it sure does seem like a lot of psychologists quote the same experiments OVER AND OVER. There is a good bit of overlap between what Kahnemann wrote and what is covered here, and so I'll try to cover what was different in this book to the aforementioned. (Was it really such news that human beings are not calculators/ economists and that they are likely to make reasoning errors accordingly?)<br /><br />4. We don't know about the external validity (i.e., how well do these things work in the REAL WORLD outside of the lab) of his experiments (1) and following that (2), how well do the experiments scale up (as in, to the scale of a whole country)? He could be blowing smoke. Already in his last book ([[ASIN:0062183591 The Honest Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone---Especially Ourselves]]), he pointed out to us that his experiments had NO external validity in explaining relative corruption across different countries.<br /><br />Specific examples:<br /><br />p. 46. Supply and demand don't really exist but prices are just anchoring and arbitrary coherence? People don't know what an object is truly worth to them? (p. 49) Um, I think what Ariely is talking about has already been addressed by the idea of Subjectivism. And that says that there is no inherent value to any object. The Marxists have already tried that one and been thoroughly rebuffed. Some objects are worth something to some people at some times something else to other people at other times. Full stop. And what about aggregating effects? Assume that some people value something too high (because of arbitrary coherence, like the author suggests). Isn't it statistically likely that others would value it too low. Over a large enough sample size, shouldn't these effects cancel each other out? (In a Gaussian distribution- like way?) He also makes this entire case over, like, 3 pages. And he is using a book on Psychology to attack the free market as a utility-maxizming device (since people don't really know what things are worth to them). He gets back to it again (p. 50). We only \\"think\\" we know what we want. I am not sure what he could be saying (although I am pretty sure what he is implying). That we don't act completely rationally and that our brain is more like a lawyer (=retroactively finding reasons) than a logician? We already knew that. (Now that I think about it, Jonah Lehrer filled a whole book with that topic. [[ASIN:0547247990 How We Decide]].) I see that he is trained in Psychology and Business Administration and not Economics.<br /><br />Chapter 4. This is the second book that I have read by this author this month, and I am learning to take him with a grain of salt. He sets up some experiments, and I have NO CLUE about their external validity (=how well they hold up in the real world outside of the lab), since the giveaway in his last book ([[ASIN:0062183591 The Honest Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone---Especially Ourselves]]) was that the entirety of his studies had almost NO external validity. P.90 Ariely stretches his case to talk about cuts in pensions/ benefits/ etc as transforming the social relationship between employers and employees into a market relationship. Was it a social relationship before? (Factories in Ford/ GM?) Did a social contract ever exist? By page 92, I have to give up trying to address every single point. I'll just generally say that the author is (1) committing the \\"Chess Piece Fallacy\\" (no, men can't be arranged like pieces on a chess board) and (2) making THE SAME mistake in confusing economic/ cost benefit issues with moral failings. And he might actually know this if he had studied a bit of the economics that he is criticizing. Now we get from drug trafficking to No Child Left Behind. Apparently up until now, education was a Social Norm-like thing. But this is making it a market norm-type thing. Why this is bad, he doesn't say (it's not like he gives us any comparison to countries that are doing it-- he just says that it is \\"bad\\" and leaves it at that). Then he gets into some unsubstantiated babbling about \\"linking education to social goals\\" (p.93) as \\"we have learned in our experiments\\" (no, we haven't-- no proof of external validity!).<br /><br />So, do we need money? (Yes, a Jew-- of all people-- asked that.) He then gets into the details of some experiments where some individuals took larger numbers of chocolates when they had to pay for them but fewer when they were offered for free. From there, he easily and quickly glides to the notion that pollution goals must be enforced by social norms (instead of financial sanction). Of course because companies are the same as people and can be expected to behave the same. And of course because these experiments are shown to have external validity.<br /><br />Chapter 6. Safe sex. Men don't like to use condoms when sexually aroused? Because they are thinking with their other head. Um, was this new? (Maury Povich has made an entire CAREER of documenting the results of this).<br /><br />Chapter 9. Loss aversion. P. 196. He's up to talking about Burridan's donkey. Nice, but another philosopher has already covered that-- over a hundred years ago. Ditto for his having brought up the economic principle that two choices that are equally good are no better than a single choice. Not exactly novel. (And that this point, I am starting to wonder: \\"What is this book about again? Weren't we on about irrationality\\").<br /><br />Chapter 10. The effect of expectations. Was it really such news that when we expect something to be good/ bad, then it really can become that (for us)? Was it really news that people have racial stereotypes? (And are they always and everywhere untrue?) Again, he covers the same experiments as Daniel Kahnemann. There was also the experiment about the violinist (Joshua Bell) playing in a subway covered in [[ASIN:0307459667 The Invisible Gorilla: How Our Intuitions Deceive Us]] by Simons and Chabris. (Doesn't it seems like psychologists quote the same experiments over and over?)<br /><br />Chapter 11. The Placebo effect. We didn't know about that? What was this book about again? Irrationality?<br /><br />Chapter 13. Here, he cannibalizes some of what went into making the book [[ASIN:0062183591 The Honest Truth About Dishonesty: How We Lie to Everyone---Especially Ourselves]]. This is tangentially related to irrationality-- in the sense that people are not quite rational in their choices about what to be honest/ dishonest about.<br /><br />Verdict: Save your time and money. Not recommended. Just an academic who has convinced himself that these things are useful/ real because he wrote them.he social relationship between employers and employees into a market relationship.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book. Ms. Day didn't go on and on rehashing the history in Bared to you. It didn't have the BDSM I was expecting, but you saw it building. Maybe in the third book. The sex scenes were not typical which made them really intense, and exciting. The love between the two characters was touching and heart breaking. The fighting did get tedious, but understandable. It had a lot of twists and turns that kept the pace fast. I love the two characters. The ending was wonderful. I just hate I have to wait so long before the next book.

B005QUQP76|5.0|Took the thing out of the package, came with a few pieces of paper. Plugged it in, lit up and worked right away. The bottom has some weights you can screw out to adjust to your liking, but I found no need for that. Im only a teen, and this thing fit comfortably in my hand. No adjustments for me, just plugged in and played. The front lit up, with a very nice blue LED. Not shabby at all. The metal it shows in the picture is genuine, and feels very solid, along with the black shroud. Not sure whats its made of, but the shroud feels great. Left and right mouse buttons are nice and wide, and big. Nice. The mouse wheel feels good, clicks nicely. Little buttons behind the wheel control sensitivity. Hit the bottommost button, the three lines in the middle go down one peg, thus lessening the sensitivity. Topmost button before the wheel increases the sensitivity. The three tiered button in the middle lights up very nicely.<br /><br />Haven't tried out the sniper or side buttons, as I haven't been able to download the software for them, as I have no internet. But Ive tried them, and they feel solid and working. They click well, and Im very confident they will work, as there was absolutely NOTHING else wrong with this mouse, and Im confident this will not be the exception.<br /><br />Get this. Great mouse for gaming, and general use. Its bigger than average mice however, might take some getting used to, but it fit very nicely in my hand, and took very few adjustments to feel natural. Every person is different, but dont let this part get in your way of buying it.

B005FZ12CK|1.0|Orwell's account of the goings on at the Aragonese front, and behind the lines is fascinating, and will engage anyone who knows Barcelona or Catalunya and Aragon well.  Throughout however, I was regularly dismayed by the ineptitude and apparently robotic nature of the translation into ebook format.  All manner of unfortunate glitches can be found, including faulty substitution of full-stops for commas, numbers for accented letters in Spanish words (e.g., 6 for &oacute;), word recognition problems (bum for burn being the most memorable), and mauling of footnotes.  I would rather carry a hard copy product than submit to this kind of degradation in future.

B0096NCVAE|5.0|This is a fun little minifigure and accessory set readily available at Lego stores or online. It's pretty much a \\"what you see is what you get\\" set, but I thought I'd just point out what's in it for all you Lego lovers out there.<br /><br />The Facts:<br /> # of pieces: 58<br />  Minifigures included: Zombie, Witch, Ghost w/ chains.<br /><br />*The zombie is unique to this set and will probably be a huge draw. He is really a nice minifigure, although why he is carrying a walkie talkie and a briefcase is beyond me.<br /><br />*The witch can be added to any haunted castle or forest cabin and carries her broom. She has some nice details on her belt.<br /><br />*The ghost is exactly the same as almost every other Lego ghost out there, but that isn't a bad thing. I, personally, can never have enough ghosts. He does come with a chain, however.<br /><br />*The tombstone build is really quite clever. It uses some simple smaller pieces to make a neat little grave. The printed tile piece that usually serves as a letter is used here on a grey piece to serve as the inscription. Lots of creepy vine pieces in dark green, also. The bat on top is listed as part of the build, but I'm sure Lego won't mind if you want to use him as a regular bat.<br /><br />*A rat, spider, red snake, and green snake round out the set, giving you a nice quartet of creep crawlers place wherever you choose.<br /><br />Overall: This is a fun little accessory set that your favorite Lego fan or Trick 'r Treater will love. I've had a blast incorporating it with my other sets, and I imagine you will too.
B009AJDDQU|2.0|I just watched this a few days ago. There are plenty of reviews giving you all the details on why this is so bad. I will add just a little bit.<br /><br />This movie is neither original nor rational. The crew act without the least bit of common sense or reason. You figure on this kind of mission they would have some procedures. Not this gang who stumble along from one disastrous mistake to next. Maybe they should have watched Andromeda Strain before heading out. It might have taught them a bit about how to go about examining alien life forms. It has all the dumb things I have come to expect of big budget. There is special effect; people with attitude; the required chase; plenty of gore and of course the naked lady running in distress. In other words it is a very typical Hollywood movie.<br /><br />On the plus side it is not the absolute worst movie I have seen. Thanks to the non stop stream of garbage being produced it misses that. Therefore it gets a 2 and not a 1.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Fun to see/hear the characters I read about come to life and compare them with what I was \\"seeing\\" in my imagination!

0525953728|5.0|very easy book to read. From what I understand the accounts of the raid on Bin Laden are accurate and are given without the political spin. It was great to read about the seals,rangers,and special ops without the hollywood drama.

0316228532|5.0|This is exactly how I imagined JK Rowling's comeback. It is a TRUE book that should be judged on its own merit ( I love HP books, if that matters). Once you clear your mind of any expectations about what this book should and shouldn't be, you will find a rare and profoundly moving literary work of an amazing writer. English( American) is my second language and yes, I understood and enjoyed every bit of the book( I'm mentioning it because a lot of people commented on the \\"trouble\\" they had with reading the book because of British English). Not only that, I swear I \\"saw\\" the future movie in my head while I was reading it, including I now have my own \\"cast\\" for it, because as much as JK Rowling denies that this is a \\"filmable\\" book, I sincerely doubt she believes it. The book is excellent, her writing is even better.<br />I highly recommend for people who enjoyed Muriel Barbery and her \\" Elegance of the Hedgehog\\"- a book about life at its most beautiful, most ugly and most truly real.<br />Hats off, Ms. Rowling!
B009OZ690C|5.0|If the series and the season of Supernatural stays as strong as the first two episodes than viewers are in for a treat. Last week Supernatural put its pieces on the board with Dean returning from Purgatory, Cas missing and unaccounted for, Sam deserting a relationship in much the same way he deserted his responsibilities and Kevin, much stronger and more competent but angered and grieved at the murder of his girlfriend at the hands of Crowley, who is seeking to regain the new prophecy tablet that details how to close the gates of hell forever.<br /><br />Sam, Dean and Keving need to recover the tablet too and set off to do so after a brief detour to find Kevin's mother and put her someplace safe. But both Keven and Kevin's mother have other ideas and this leads the entire group to a very strange auction of magical artifacts. This auction is a great set-piece and has some Easter eggs in it from other favorites of the fantastic including Raiders of the Lost Ark and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br /><br />I won't give any more details of a wonderful episode except to say that we end with more complications than we started with but in a believeable and organic way. The viewer is also treated to more flashbacks of Dean's time in Purgatory, a storyline that is shaping up to be one of the most interesting ever, especially in light of the fact that we saw only the results of Dean's trip to hell. Highly recommended and I am more excited for a season of SPN than I have been since the apocalypse was coming. Highly recommended.<br /><br />A final aside - Pluto, the God of Greed has a cameo in the episode and it is a pretty good joke on the way the word plutocrat has been so common in political commentary lately.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The novel was action packed but not overwhelming.  Good balance of background information to prepare the reader with appreciating the efforts of these very brave men.  There was just enough technical information to help build on the story line without distracting from the action.  Enjoyed reading and kept me wanting to turn to the next page.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the first book.  And, I loved the movie.  I thought the 2nd book was more of the same.  Luckily, it was more of what I liked about the first one (which I can't explain without \\"giving it away\\").  So, no harm done.  And, it leads right into the last book. I look forward to this book being made into a movie.<br /><br />.....Not excited about the last one or it's movie, though.<br /><br />This series is pretty nice to dive into now that the saga of HARRY POTTER has concluded in both books and movies.

159413586X|4.0|It may just be my attention span, but usually by the third book of a triolgy, I am burned out by the  \\"sameness\\" and this is no exception.  Still a good book, but pretty much the same stuff as the Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  I was a little disappointed on how much Katniss played the victim throughout, (but I guess if I went through everything she did I would be a raving lunatic too) but still good.  It was a little predictable, the whole district 13 compared to Capital. Personally I liked Catching Fire better, I liked the character development of the past tribute winners, thought it was an interesting mix.<br />  If you read the first two, then you have to read the third to see how it ends.
B004RQVVFQ|5.0|Former Black Sabbath lead singer Ozzy Osbourne's second solo album Diary of a Madman was released in November of 1981 (nearly thirty one years ago).<br />When Ozzy Osbourne released his first album after his Black Sabbath ouster called Blizzard Of Ozz (which included a stellar band including ex-Rainbow bass player Bob Daisley, Uriah Heep drummer Lee Kerslake and the late great guitarist Randy Rhoads) in late 1980 in Europe (its US release came in early 1981), he proved he could survive without Black Sabbath with great success.<br />In early 1981, Ozzy (plus Rhoads, Kerslake and Daisley) re-entered Ridge Farm Recording Studios to record his second solo album and the pressure was on to deliver an album that was either as good as his debut or better. Would Ozzy and company deliver or would they be written off. Read ahead and find out (as I did when I first acquired the cassette in March of 1984 on recommendation after liking Bark at the Moon so much as a just turned 8 year old).<br />We kick things off with one of Ozzy's best rockers \\"Over the Mountain\\" which had one of the best rock drumming intros and a great solo work from Rhoads. Next was the album's rock radio staple \\"Flying High Again\\" which is a great number. Next is the other rock radio staple and the truth about rock music in general \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\". This near seven minute epic is about Ozzy's true love (Rock and Roll). Randy Rhoads' guitar work here was unreal. The first side closed with a great rocker out of \\"Believer\\". Great musicianship and vocal work from Ozzy.<br />The album's second half kicks off with \\"Little Dolls\\" which had another stellar Kerslake drum intro which went into a great rocker. Next is another ballad \\"Tonight\\" which slows things down a bit but still a stellar song. We follow with the rocker \\"S.A.T.O.\\" and is another winner. We close with the epic haunting title cut which featured some of Rhoads' best guitar work and superb musicianship from Kerslake and Daisley plus haunting choir and strings.<br />Diary of a Madman was yet another Top 20 smash for The Ozzman and his first Platinum seller in the US (now at over four million in US sales).<br />This album was sadly the last with Ozzy's first (and still best) solo band as Messieurs Kerslake and Daisley were fired upon the album's completion and then sadly Randy Rhoads would tragically die in a plane crash in March of 1982 whilst touring with Ozzy en route to a show in Orlando, Fla (to play a show with Foreigner).<br />I (being a fan of the original album) avoided the atrocious 2002 re-issues which saw Sharon Osbourne spitefully and coldly delete Daisley and Kerslake's bass guitar and drum parts respectively and replace them with Robert Trujillo (now Metallica's bass player) and now ex-Ozzy and Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin who slaughtered this masterpiece because she would not pay Daisley and Kerslake their owed royalties for their hard work on the album. However in 2011, the album was reissued with the original performances of Kerslake, Daisley, Rhoads and Osbourne REINSTATED and brilliantly remastered by the now sadly deceased George Marino (giving the 1995 remaster done by mastering legend Bob Ludwig a run for its money). This is the single disc remaster (which is what I have and was released in April of 2012 as a standalone) and also comes with an extra live CD which rivals the 1987 album Tribute (although kind of useless if you already have Tribute but if you want to compare and contrast those buy the deluxe edition although this single disc remaster is also worth it).<br />RECOMMENDED!ng choir and strings.<br />Diary of a Madman was yet another Top 20 smash for The Ozzman and his first Platinum seller in the US (now at over four million in US sales).<br />This album was sadly the last with Ozzy's first (and still best) solo band as Messieurs Kerslake and Daisley were fired upon the album's completion and then sadly Randy Rhoads would tragically die in a plane crash in March of 1982 whilst touring with Ozzy en route to a show in Orlando, Fla (to play a show with Foreigner).<br />I (being a fan of the original album) avoided the atrocious 2002 re-issues which saw Sharon Osbourne spitefully and coldly delete Daisley and Kerslake's bass guitar and drum parts respectively and replace them with Robert Trujillo (now Metallica's bass player) and now ex-Ozzy and Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin who slaughtered this masterpiece because she would not pay Daisley and Kerslake their owed royalties for their hard work on the album.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Well, now... that's what I call a story.  Funny how people write a book about a moody vampire (most are moody right?) and a blase girl and comparisons are made to Twilight.  Someone writes a book about dysfunctional love and it's another Shades book (which I enjoyed), but there should be no comparison here folks.<br />I enjoyed the first book in this series and if I'm not mistaken, wrote a review on Kindle, but this one is not to be missed.  Absolutely loved it!!!  I'm sure there are plenty of spoilers along the way, so I will reveal nothing, but not only is there growth within the characters of Gideon and Eva, but it seems in Ms. Day's writing as well.  This is the second book I have read by this author and I'm real impressed.  Carry on and Read folks.  By the way- Thanks so much Sylvia for the break in reality.  I cannot wait until the next installment and from the great reviews, neither can all your fans!
B008SVS0K0|5.0|While their sound on this album may be altered a bit from their last two or three albums, their lyricism, messages and musicianship remain top-notch.  Overall, I think this is as good as II, my favorite album of theirs.  I've always loved the drums on the previous albums because they seemed to have their own melody (a la \\"Fallen Leaves) and not just drive the song along.  On this album, they seem to have been pulled back a bit into more of a \\"keep the beat with some fun stuff thrown in\\" role.  Guitars go from chugging to off beat accents to solos and everything is awesome.  The singing is the unique voice as always and the harmonies are as good as ever.  It's always great to have a punk singer who can, ya know, sing.<br /><br />Song breakdown!<br /><br />1) Lonely Road to Absolution - Fitting introduction.  Sets the tone for the rest of the album.  Epic feeling and leads directly into...<br /><br />2) Viking Death March - A quintessential \\"speak your mind and fight the power\\" song.  Great music and powerful lyrics \\"You preach about love/And teach about fate/But all your beliefs are still rooted in hate/\\".  Will definitely be a crowd favorite (it was the single, after all).<br /><br />3) Surprise, Surprise - This is their \\"don't buy into the mainstream crap\\" song like \\"Where is the Line\\".  Very, very catchy.<br /><br />4) Running Across the Tracks - Unique sounding song, not like anything else on the album.  More screaming, more accenting instruments instead of a steady melody.  Very fun song to sing along with in the car and headbang with.<br /><br />5) Love Was Still Around - This song took a while to warm up to, but once you read the lyrics, you'll get the message and the song will stick with you.  It's directed at an unnamed person who commits a mass shooting and asking them if they regret it.  \\"It's easy to think twice/A choice can change your life\\".<br /><br />6) Stand Up and Run - Sappy love song.  My least favorite track.  Not a bad song, but doesn't feel upto par with the rest of the album.<br /><br />7) Crooked Minds - A definite headbanger.  Chugging guitars and lots of screaming.  Message is about the natural environment being taken away by cities.  \\"They swallow up the green and build up the gray\\"<br /><br />8) Man Alive! - Fast paced song about living your life and not wasting it by working for nothing.  Not my favorite, but not bad.<br /><br />9) Hanging By A Thread - One of my favorites to sing along with.  Sounds almost like a radio song, but I don't care.  The lyrics are great and it's a very catchy song.<br /><br />10) Cure for the Enemy - Definite top 3 for the album.  Guitar melody sticks out as very unique sounding and you'd be able to pick the song out of a line up.  Just an overall great song.<br /><br />11) Don't Count on the Wicked - Another song that took a while for me to like.  The intro kicks you in the face and I love the singing in this one.  The ending is powerful and will definitely be a sing along at concerts.<br /><br />12) Show Me The Way - Meh.  An alright song.  I skip it most of the time.  Is very forgettable.  The chorus could be sung along with at a concert, but it doesn't hold up to the rest of the album.<br /><br />13) Swallowed Up By The Ocean - An amazing slower song by them.  The piano intro is something that will catch those unaware by surprise.  Great singing and building up of the song.  An unexpected favorite.<br /><br />14) Dead Silence - End with the title track.  Signature Billy Talent sound.  Their guitars have that very distinct sound to them, the drums are busy doing their thing, and there's plenty of accenting harmonies in the vocal department.<br /><br />Probably my favorite album that's been released this year so far and will get plenty of play next to the rest of the Billy Talent albums.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is a great game.  i enjoyed playing it. it is a fun and addicting game. I would recommend this game to others.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Harboring a deep affinity for the series, and being appreciative of the productions of Tim Burton {especially in combination with Maestro Danny Elfman's orchestrations}, it seemed a natural inspection. He does have a knack for splendidly presenting the Gothic sensibility to a fine point, after all.<br /><br />I first became pleasantly aware of this sinister series through rebroadcasts on a local channel, and has since become preferred entertainment fare, which is presented in a serious vain, whose Gothic psychodramas seem to reflect many predispositions and innate interests. The uses of mood lighting, suspenseful music, occult story lines, grants it a brooding atmosphere similar to Hammer films, yet imbued with Dan Curtis' unique psychological darkness. Dark Shadows features not only vampires & witches, but warlocks, werewolves, zombies, ghosts, sinister cults, insane preachers, time-travels, mad killers, demons, & many more creatures & situations of a paranormal nature.<br /><br />As far as Dark Shadows films are concerned, I personally recommend [[ASIN:B008JL8NQ0 House of Dark Shadows]] & [[ASIN:B008JLBNLW Night of Dark Shadows]].<br /><br />So, when I first viewed the preview for the film, it was a bit underwhelming, as it focuses primarily on the 70's comedic elements, yet in the overall film, it actually became beside the point. Actually, I thought it a bit appropriate after all, that since the series was broadcast in the late 60's/early 70's season {actually premiering in Year 1 A.S.}, that the setting seemed to make sense for a plot such as this. Being leery of any 'remakes, since the early 90's adaptation was actually a pleasing tribute, but what may be condensed in a 113 minute film? Obviously, if you want the real thing, just continue viewing and submerging yourself therein. I have been collecting these on DVD as they became available, & most remarkably, the entire series has recently become available in the marvelous [[ASIN:B007PZ6SYK Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition)]].<br /><br />In October of VII A.S., Barnabas Collins is unleashed from a century of subterranean incarceration by construction workmen {instead of groundskeeper Willy Loomis immediately, whom he meets shortly}, who of course, sates his blood lust forthwith. He meets a drunken Willy {his 'Renfield'} wandering the Collinswood grounds among the pumpkins, who after a quick interrogation about the current surroundings, quickly assumes his role.<br /><br />Arriving at the Collinswood estate, he meets with elegant matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard and the rest of the surviving family. She is obviously taken aback by his arrival {return}, thus revealing some interesting house secrets during the introduction. After all, a pleasantly dark chamber via a secret passageway is a necessity for any vampire! His descriptions of the architecture and history of the fine resident possessions therein are a remarkable relation, in marked appreciation for the construction of their materialization.<br /><br />Present are Elizabeth {the lovely, stately, lady of the manor}, Dr. Hoffman {here, the professional intellectual physician is portrayed as an attractive, fiery-haired lush living a life of quiet desperation}, David {well-portrayed, rather like a Damien}, pretty little Carolyn Stoddard {the impetuous blonde here portrayed as a hippie-like stoner / rebellious 'party girl' type}, & Roger Collins {the stoic gentleman here portrayed as a rude, inconstant, boorish lothario}. While Barnabas himself is here portrayed in a more slender variation, more akin to a callow Nosferatu, intentionally depicted.<br /><br />With the help of these new-found relatives, Barnabas goes about familiarizing himself with the culture, to some amusing interactions with automobiles, entertainment evolutions, & technological advancements. The juxtaposition between a gentleman of eloquence, fine tastes, irrefutable deportment, dashing style, and elite dispositions, to thatof an increasingly vulgar, down-slidden society are tangibly evident.<br /><br />Arriving as David's new nanny, Barnabas is smitten with Victoria Winters, seemingly Josette resurrected, who, in another fanciful twist among many, here arrives in Collinwood from that fateful train ride deriving from no less than an asylum. Most amusingly intriguing indeed.<br /><br />He eventually becomes re-acquainted with a busty Angelique Bouchard, the source of his torments, for those unfamiliar, in what would amount to be an undead fatal attraction, the witch who commended him into the coffin-prison for refuting her advances in favor of his dear Josette DuPres {a sweetly diminutive fianc&eacute;}, who herself plunged from Widow's Hill at the bidding of black witchcraft. Harboring resentment of Barnabas & the successes of The Collins Family since childhood, Angelique uses her own immortality & wiles to raise her family name to prominence. Of course, that re-acquaintance yields a passionate fling finally culminating in a final battle.<br /><br />Notable scenes include: one Alice Cooper performing at a ball circa Welcome to My Nightmare, with Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby and Kathryn Leigh Scott in attendance. \\"David! Go watch the Cooper woman!\\"; a haggard Christopher Lee as Clarney the fisherman hypnotized by Barnabas; Barnabas lays some hippies to waste while camping in the forest.<br /><br />As pleasurably typical of Tim Burton productions, the sets are a majestic marvel to behold, the music enriching with an inspired soundtrack by Danny Elfman, familiar & compelling characterizations, complimenting the overall experience. In this case, this rendition is an amusing aside, created as a quirky notion of how a vampire would interact with an outside herd world, in continued predation, of course. As a combination Gothic / Comedy / Thriller, it certainly has its moments in the shadows, even while venturing into the lightmare, and may certainly be good for a nefarious cachinnation or two, while asserting an enhanced appreciation for the core origins.of an increasingly vulgar, down-slidden society are tangibly evident.<br /><br />Arriving as David's new nanny, Barnabas is smitten with Victoria Winters, seemingly Josette resurrected, who, in another fanciful twist among many, here arrives in Collinwood from that fateful train ride deriving from no less than an asylum.

B005LAJ22Q|2.0|It's mainly about a bunch of individuals in the middle of a war who are unable to get over their petty differences and simply get along with each other.  They all end up killing each other with their own stupidity.  Why have people in your zombie fighting group who can't be trusted?  Then there is the backstory about stumbling zombies who apparently are able to move at a consistent 15 MPH.  Just have some zombie rules and follow them.  They're stumbling and they walk really slow, so follow that one freaking rule at least.  Show some consistency.  We find out that apparently everyone is a carrier and Rick held it from the group (seems like this would be really relevant given his wife is pregnant with a possible zombie baby).  The CDC guy informed them of this which is odd because he was following all the CDC protocol to avoid exposure to the disease.  Please don't try explaining it...it is just stupid.  Then some other group wants to take over their farm because apparently, there aren't enough empty farms to be found in the country during a zombie apocalypse, and it is necessary to take stuff from people.  Instead of hitting up Walmart for supplies they go into a town with lots of buildings and hit a tiny pharmacy that isn't very secure.  Their zombies are less intelligent than buffalo, and yet they can't figure out how to kill masses of them.  Finally, one would think they would use some strategy in fighting the zombies and secure the perimeter, but nope, none of that stuff....just hold up in a farm next to some woods.  They don't even give any thought to weapons.  Nobody bothers with a silencer of any kind, and instead of using weapons like oh a baseball bat, a long machette, or a samurai sword, their weapons of choice are screwdrivers and knives that result in lots of blood getting sprayed all over them.  Writers should have watched Zombieland a few times.  Should I even mention trying to drive a ancient Winnebago across the country in a post apocalyptic world?  Oh, and what the heck is with them coveting a crappy book?  Did libraries, book stores, book shelves, etc go away in their post apocalyptic world?

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Its addicting for some reason, but pretty pointless. There is no real entertainment level, and any enjoyment is ruined by the coin regeneration. Unless you are actually willing to spend real money for fake money that you are literally throwing into a bottomless pit! Please don't be one of those poor souls!

B0018QOIXU|3.0|Once I heard Adele's voice in February 2012, I decided to buy both her albums.  This is her first album and her voice and songs aren't all that great.  Her voice doesn't sound as profressional as her voice on Adele 21.  There are 2 songs on the Adele 19 CD that I love but the rest of the album I skip over.

B008EZVNO0|3.0|First, I'm a huge Van fan -- I own every one of his albums, have seen him many times in concert, and I find that each album he puts out has its own merits.  I agree with other reviewers that his catalog of work is best separated into various phases, such that a 4-star review of his later work (e.g., Magic Time) cannot be compared to, say, a 4-star review of his earlier work (e.g., Veedon Fleece).<br /><br />With that out of the way, I cannot agree that Born to Sing falls anywhere on the level of some of his better post-1997 solo works - those being, in my opinion, Back on Top, Down the Road and Magic Time.  And in no way could I give this album \\"5 stars\\" on any scale, except for perhaps Van's actual singing of the songs.<br /><br />Perhaps my somewhat negative reception of Born to Sing stems from my general aversion to \\"smooth jazz,\\" but I find that many of these new tunes stretch into that category -- and are boring, unfocused, and/or meandering, tied together with somewhat uninspired lyrics.  I could listen to Van sing the phone book, so my complaints aren't with the way the tunes are sung (which is, as always, great).  But, I just didn't find myself all that excited with most of the songs or Van's lyrics.  To sum it up, when listening to the album on my drive home from work yesterday, I felt myself being lulled to sleep and, eventually, skipping songs about 2\3 of the way through.<br /><br />Maybe they'll grow on me, but at first blush, I think that this album will end up with What's Wrong with this Picture in my hierarchy of Van albums, such that I will likely skip many of these songs when they come up on shuffle.<br /><br />As I said, each Van album does in my opinion have its merits -- and I have to disagree with many of the reviewers here regarding Keep It Simple and think that songs like Lover Come Back and Song of Home are great, among others -- and on Born to Sing, so far I enjoy Open the Door (To Your Heart), Born to Sing, Mystic of the East and Pagan Heart.<br /><br />Like most of Van's later-day works, I'm sure these songs will translate well to his live shows, and hopefully he'll venture out of England and Ireland to promote the new disc.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a long and complex book of ancient fiction. Beware you cannot put it down even in the wee hours of the morn. I found myself reading at  three am. The characters are fully developed even though that development takes place over long sections of the book. Just think of a  miget challanging a knight to a duel with crab forks while standing on a chair. Fantastic. Or the presents of an evil queen. If you like this sort of things this is for you.

1609611543|5.0|This was an easy quick read, entertaining and fact based. As a 50+ tri-athlete, I've been active and healthy my whole life but see so many of my friends gaining weight and having issues with digestion and allergies. I've been off wheat for a week now since finishing the book and noticing that I'm not having energy crashes in the afternoon. As a carbohydrate lover, it's been a challenge, but the cravings are easing off now. I still get carbs but from alternate grains that have less impact to my body. It's scary that genetically altered food is not being tested by the FDA more thoroughly. Hopefully books like this will reach a broad audience. I may be giving this book out as Christmas presents this year.
0812984412|5.0|The thing that makes Cloud Atlas so wonderful is not merely Mitchell's structural acrobatics, the way he unwinds and then rewinds the chain of interlocking narratives, (though he does do this better than most authors who try dicking around with it), but how he uses that framework as a way of showing off his formidable stylistic chops. The guy seems like he can write anything and make it work, whether its a prudish Victorian era journal, the letters of a witty bisexual composer, a hysterical, nabakovian account of being trapped in assisted living, a frightening post-apocalyptic vision using thick dialogue a la clockwork orange, whatever style and voice he chooses he makes both engaging and humane. The fact that these stories overlay and resonate through each other on top of being well written is remarkable. And the precision and smoothness with which they unfold is almost unbelievable. At no point did I doubt that I was reading a single, unified work instead of some well wrought short stories thrown together at random. Cloud Atlas is the product of a fierce and generous mind. Highly recommended.
B003K16PFU|5.0|Orwell is unquestionably one of the most plain-spoken and honest-minded writers it has been my pleasure to encounter.  Here he takes us behind the lines in a battle for the hearts and minds and bodies of Spain.  We see not only what the man on the front suffers, but how political jockeying resulted in the deaths of good people, and needless suffering.<br />I value this book not just for what it reveals about Spanish culture, about pre-WWII European politics, about the nature of the communist party elite vs. that of its members, but really, for how it reveals what it was like to be a human caught up in a massive grist mill.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so much fun. my mom got me addicted and then we pulled my sister in...now we all play it together! great stress reliever!
B002Q4TKAY|2.0|I read the positive reviews and bought this. I should have checked the negative review. Regarding the cd, it is an accurate critique. The sound is awful. On a number of tracks, especially \\"Spaceman\\" and \\"When You Were Young, the guitar is barely audible. The DVD is better quality but not great.<br />Steer clear.

B008J34466|5.0|Pink does it again with another awesome album. I got the explicit version, as an adult, I like to hear all that Pink has to say. Gritty and good, I highly recommend this for all Pink fans. Great songs, great price!
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book stole my heart! This book has passion, flare, tension and SO MUCH HEART BEHIND EVERY WORD AND THOUGHT! I absolutely recommend this book. Lauren Oliver has quickly become one of my favorite authors- she is brilliant! The second book is AMAZING as well. Talk about a cliff-hanger! If you want to find your next great read....READ THIS BOOK!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I think there was some question as to whether Joss Whedon could pull this off.  Had he ever directed anything with such scale?  Could he handle something bigger than a TV budget?  In hindsight, this shouldn't come as much of a surprise.  His whole career has led to this moment.  He's dealt with epic storylines full of set ups and big payoffs for years, just on TV.  Juggling several characters at once has become his bread and butter.  All that was left was could he handle the scale.<br /><br />Yes, yes he can.  This movie leads up to pure spectacle.  We get to see all the heroes we've spent several individual movies coming to know team up to stop the epic<br />destruction of New York.  It's all well handled with great individual moments amongst the team and some great moments of team work sprinkled in as well.  All the<br />characters and their specific powers come into play in all sorts of glorious and camera loving ways as the heroes rain justice on the invading Chitari.  The Hulk in particular has plenty of crowd pleasing moments.<br /><br />That is the payoff.  The set up is what makes the movie work.  The assembling of the Avengers as we catch up to all the various characters from where we left them<br />in their individual movies and then try to gel them together is where I think the real fun of the movie is.  All these guys are different in so many ways; the playboy, the scientist, the spy, the soldier and the demi-god.  The genius of the flick is that it took these characters from movies ranging from the realism of Iron Man, the war-movie of Captain America and the fantasy of Thor and made them gel together in a very believable way.  Sure, it works in the comic books all the time, but film is a different medium.  The fact that Marvel pulled it off is almost miraculous. And the first hour or so of the movie that Whedon and team build the characters and show them learn to interact and play well together really pays off when The Avengers have to save the world.<br /><br />The blu-ray looks and sounds great.  I don't think anyone will be surprised by that.  This is one of the biggest movies of all time, so of course Disney and Marvel are gonna make it look good with some nice spit and polish.  Not that it probably needed a whole lot of spit and polish, it was already pretty spectacular looking.  Not gonna lie, though, I was hoping for some more extras.  We get a few deleted/extended scenes and a cute little 10 minute short movie about a young couple robbing banks with the one remaining alien weapon left over from the main event.  There a couple of short docs chronicling various aspects of the movie, but I was just hoping for a little more meat on those bones.  A landmark movie like this calls for big time full length documentaries and interviews and just really digging into the making, marketing and aftermath of the film.  Alas, that's not to be.  Here anyways.<br /><br />It's a nice Blu-Ray, don't get me wrong.  Very worthy of adding to your collection for just the epic scope of superhero storytelling on display in the main movie.  I was hoping for a bit more in the special features arena, but it's not enough of a gripe to mark it down.  I'm sure down the road we'll get an edition full of even more scenes, big time documentaries, a commentary from Samuel L. Jackson in character as Jules from Pulp Fiction and other wild and off the wall geek pandering stuff.  Until then, this is a fun movie that looks great on a big TV and the fact is you've probably bought it already.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|I bought 2i2 from local store because I wanted to use on a day that I found this on Amazon. So, I paid extra $13. I had installation of Protools 9 on my Macbook pro for the use of M-Audio 2626. 2i2 worked immediately with Protools 9 after the driver was downloaded from Focusrite site.<br /><br />I have been using 2i2 for recording jazz lives at local venues ( mostly restaulants ), when larger number of microphones are not necessary. Macbook pro, 2i2, a couple of microphones ( Earthworksaudio SR20 ), a headphone and cables fit in a shopping bag easily, although microphone stands do not. Carrying into the venues and setting-up are very quick and easy. 2i2 with Protools gives me more flexibility than two channel portable recorder boxs. It is nicer if the headphone amplifier makes higher output. I guess the limitation comes from the use of USB power. But, I prefer USB powered instead of having independent power supply. I edit Protool sessions at my studio where I have a Protools HD system. The microphone preamps are low noise, low distortion and are usable in quiet environment at my studio. 2i2 is not only for starters and beginners.<br /><br />I am going to buy another 2i2 for replacing one of PC's sound card because 2i2 is USB powered and has good sound quality. It is nice to see Focusrite avoided MIDI, S/P and TOS links, which are not necessary for most people, and cut the cost. I wish Focusrite will sell 2 more microphone input version of this.
0525953728|5.0|The experience was extremely well written. I totally agree with the statement about our policy makers asking us to ignore all the lessions previously learned. Especially where the enemy knows  our rules of engagement, therefore working their way through the system and back into their villages, just to fight, and in a few days. Also, hiding their weapons, knowing that we wouldn't shoot them if they weren't armed. Faced the same in Nam. I totally agree on the reason this book was written (someone had to tell the true story, this autobiography did just that. Superb reading.

B00881VLCE|5.0|I downloaded this app for something nice to direct my focus to before going to sleep.  Did one puzzle and couldn't wait to get out of work today so I could do another one.  A boring life?  Not at all!  I just love doing something and seeing the results right away.  So satisfying in a small way!
0525953728|5.0|A wonderful first hand account of a member of Seal team 6,s training and leading up to and including the mission<br />that took out Osama Bin Laden. God Bless the 5.56 nato. The only regret I have in reading No easy Day was that I was not<br />the shooter to take that fatal head shot.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|The first half of the book is all about ninja school.  It's darker than Harry Potter but the jist is the same.  I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.  The meta story is solid and the world is interesting.  I've still got 15% to go according to Kindle but barring some unfortunate turn to the stupid I'm really impressed.  As for characters the king and the princess are both fantastic.  The main protagonist is more of a mix.  He's a super ninja killer of baddassatude who's caught up in events beyond his control.  He doesn't whine about it which is great but he does seem helpless despite being a super ninja baddass.<br /><br />Anyway fun read.  I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy books.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This story starts out seemingly as a simple reaction to a life crises. It humorously develops as a modern little epic played against the British countryside. It's striking crises is deftly traversed to a believable and uplifting conclusion. A lean, readable modern tale providing realistic hope for all of us.
0316228532|5.0|This is one of the most tragic books I've ever read. I ended up speeding through the second half in one day to get it over with because I didn't want to linger over it. One reason it's so particularly sad is that it's about modern life for many people, both well-to-do and poor. I hope a lot of people read this book. I think it could be an eye-opener for many.<br /><br />My favorite scene is what Parminder says to Howard on page 388, during the council meeting.<br /><br />[I wrote the above review at GoodReads.  In response to someone telling me she hadn't heard the book called \\"tragic\\" before, I added the following.]<br /><br />It's tragic in the sense that life is tough for some people due to unfortunate circumstances and a lot of other people make their lives and the lives of others difficult because of closed-mindedness, selfishness, etc. and can't or refuse to even acknowledge it. Besides, there is at least one completely innocent young life lost during the novel; I'm surprised if no one has called the book tragic. It's definitely far from the happy-ending-good-guys-always-win theme of the Harry Potter books (which is perfectly okay; I know she emphasized this is not a book for kids).<br /><br />It's a great book, but not an uplifting book. Not a book to be read if you want to cheering up. It's more of a social statement on modern life. I know JKR was glad to be in the financial position to write freely, to write exactly what she wanted to write without much care for what fans or publishers want, and I have the feeling she took the opportunity to write something that could open up some minds, spur some action, make people think, at least make people more aware. I probably will never read it again because I did not enjoy it, but it made a strong impression on me anyway so I don't think I will forget any of it. I'm glad I did read it, though, and I do think it is a great book with the potential to affect some change for the better in the world.<br /><br />p.s.  On a related note, because it annoys me when other people say otherwise, I just want to say that the Harry Potter books are NOT just for kids (and I believe JKR did not intend them to be either).  Many adults including myself (almost 41 years old!) have enjoyed them and re-read them again and again.  :)a related note, because it annoys me when other people say otherwise, I just want to say that the Harry Potter books are NOT just for kids (and I believe JKR did not intend them to be either).

0525953728|5.0|What a great book about Navy Seals.  I wish there was more details on the kinds of equipment they use and the tactics, but I'm sure this all classified. I still think one of the coolest things is at the armory where above the door reads, \\"you dream it, we build it.\\"  I think I wanna join the Navy now!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is really awesome. It is very specific, and I would totally recommend this app to anyone who likes to know how much time they can watch videos, or play music, before their battery runs out. Overall awesome app!

B003N0XDT4|1.0|I've paired this with the L7 dock but cannot get Windows 7 nor OSX Lion to actually recognise the device, apart from as a default USB Audio device. Sound is *not* being processed by the DAC as I can switch back to the PC's sound card and there is no difference, also the volume control on E7 has no effect.<br /><br />I can vouch for the amplifier working and definitely giving a better soundstage, and driving my headphones very nicely when connected directly to an iPod, but I use this most of the time at my desk at work. After nearly a year now I have yet to actually hear the DAC!<br /><br />Unfortunately I'd give it 0 stars if I could because it actually does absolutely nothing. Kinda disappointed. No answers to this problem on the net. Colleague also has exact same problem.<br /><br />If anyone can reply with details on how to get a computer to *correctly* recognise the DAC I'll adjust the stars accordingly.
1449410243|5.0|I absolutely love this book. From the first cartoon to the last, it was a non-stop laugh. I would recommend this book to anyone with a pulse; folks with a dead sense of humor may not find this book funny and should restrict their reading to things like stereo instructions, dictionary and bubble gum wrappers. If you're a Oatmeal fan, this is a must-add to your comic collection.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great way to keep those cool  ideas organized without all those pieces of paper \\"somewhere\\" in the house.  I download into my Kindle Fire and they are always with me.  So easy to use!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|The kids love it a lot & already request that I re install the game whenever I have to do a re-do on the Kindle for whatever reason. The also always ask me to buy the next one whenever a new one comes out & I'm happy to do so since it keeps them occupied.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I like the ipad format from Kindle and enjoy the convenience of the reading option.  The style of the the story follows well with the fir 4 books.  I really enjoy this series.  I like a good costume fantasy with a healthy dose of philosophy on the human condition.

B008XG1X18|4.0|Easy to navigate! Love this app. Its a great way to find ideas for the things in life that you love. The only issue I have found is when searching for Facebook friends it will tell me that I'm not logged into Facebook when I am. Otherwise, it's great!
B0045INOCO|3.0|Apocalypse Now is a film about a soldier who's sent to the Vietnam war to find a Colonel who is stopped adhering to the instructions of the US ARMY and is acting with free will. The entire film is a journey witnessed from first person played by the said soldier. During the course of the film, he learns more and more about the Vietnam war and the Colonel who he is supposed to terminate.  The war is shocking as the encounters occur and eventually after 80% of the film is over he finally finds what he came for but by then the film takes a completely different turn leaving the viewer feeling a little out of it. Considering this was made in 1979, I must commend the director for such an epic visual journey, some scenes were deranged and completely out of proportion. While the film has good action over a slow paced film, it left me feeling a little uneasy because it scratched the surface of a subject I am very unaware of. Perhaps when It came out, it was a big deal and the topic was relevant but the film does not come easy without seeming a little self indulgent. Is it a must watch though? Maybe. A little pretentious too because the script could have been a little more self aware.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'd like to start by saying that I am not usually a huge fan of science fiction. That being said, Ender's Game is a wonderful story. I had a hard time putting this book down. The author paints a picture of a world in the future that is so different from our's today, and yet so curiously interesting. I loved the character development of Ended and his siblings. If you are looking for something new and different, take a chance on Ended.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It started out one way and then it took those sudden turns that I didn't see coming.  It kept my interest.

B00914JWSW|3.0|I like it, but I do not love it.  I imagine that is why these tracks were not released when originally recorded.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled upon this and, for a couple bucks, took a flyer on it.  Very pleasantly surprised.  Thus far, the best I've read in the last year and an absolute page turner/next page button presser.  Well written, well planned, interesting characters, engrossing \\"landscape\\" and believable plotlines all contribute to a book that I love recommending to friends.  That this indie author has since been picked up by a major publishing house is all the sweeter.<br /><br />Random Aside: I read this book and happened to be listening to Nicolas Jaar's album, Space is Only Noise.  It meshed with it perfectly.  It is slightly weird music but there are random drips and noises and blips in it that just made the silo come alive.  It is worth a listen while you're reading, especially with volumes 3+.  Just a thought.
B007PFD90G|4.0|This is a fine book by an author I admire tremendously. (Actually, I'd have given it four and a half stars if that had been a choice.) His prose is flawless and clear, and it's written in straightforward time sequence. (That's in contrast to some of Rushdie's novels, which display \\"magical realism\\" and are not in linear time sequence. For example, try his Booker Prize winning \\"Midnight's Children.\\")<br /><br />I have one small complaint: He devotes a lot of the book to name-dropping. He was acquainted (though not always on friendly terms) with just about everybody who was anything in Brit Lit.

B003HARV3Y|2.0|My son and I have both read the entire Percy Jackson series, plus the Kane Chronicles and the Heroes of Olympus (that last series to date; we are at yet another cliff-hanger in the series at the moment); thus, I had high hopes when I found this DVD at the library. We were both filled with shock at the liberties that the movie was taking with the book, and we were taking turns in pointing out things that were wrong, wrong, wrong. Still quite early in the movie, I made a rule: we were to forget about the book and just sit back and try to enjoy the movie as just a movie. We then took it in turns to call out \\"forget the book\\" when the other one of us couldn't contain ourselves any more.<br /><br />So as a film of the book, this movie was a disaster. But was it a good movie in its own right? If so, maybe that could excuse the terrible adaptation of the book. I had to sit back and give myself time to think about this. Forget the book, forget the book, forget the book.... Nah! It was a pretty bad movie independent of the poor adaptation issue. It also required some background knowledge from the book to know what on earth was going on.<br /><br />What was the point of making the movie? Who is it for? It is not for fans of the book because any fan of the book is going to come away from this movie frothing at the mouth. The movie is so poor that if you are not a fan of the book, you wouldn't want to waste you time on it. The only reason that I am giving this two stars rather than one star is that I saw an adaptation of \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" the same week as this, and - trust me - that would have been negative stars if I could make it happen.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was so good, I could not put it down..I have enjoyed the Heroes of Olympus series and can not wait for the fourth book . I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the Gods.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love the games that I can get on my kindle fire including this one. but I am really sick of games that charge you for content! I know I got this game for free but still think I shouldn't have to pay for coins!

B003UBTX72|5.0|This book was well reviewed and justifiably so. Keith Richards is a real guy, and probably a great guy, bad druggie or not. The thing that impressed me the most about him and about the Stones is that they didn't set out to be the international phenom they became. They set out to play the Blues at a time when that was not a big deal in England or anyplace else outside of West Memphis AR. So they didn't just ride a wave; they created it. It's interesting also what has happened to his friendship with Mick Jaggar. When they were kids they were tight, and Keith still loves him, but the differences that have grown up in the way they've handled their success have created strains. I can sympathize, as my best friend from hippie daze has become an executive vice president of an international aerospace conglomerate. I still love the guy, but we don't have as much to talk about anymore. I guess those dynamics run through everybody's life.<br />The Stones are a big part of everybody's life from back in the day. It's good to see that the one guy you thought would self-destruct is not only surviving but thriving. Long may he wave.
0061969664|2.0|I really enjoyed the first three books of the Saxon Tales.  Great history, great characterers, great action.  The next two books dampened my enthusiasm as the same themes moved toward boring.  This sixth book is boring.  Ultred is still wandering through Wessex and Mercia, fighting the good fight, slaughtering with a purpose, and continuing his love-hate relationship with Alfred and priests in general. Same themes, but now Cornwell introduces the older, wiser Ultred who spends pages figeting about whether he's doing the right thing everytime he has to make a decision. And using lots of pages doing it.  What was amusing in the first books, especially Ultred's take on Church practicies and policies, has worn out. What was shocking has become ho-hum---so he's killed a bunch of hairy guys with horned helmets again. What was good history has been slowed to s snail's pace, presumably to allow for another six or ten books. I realize that writers need to sell books to live.  But Cornwell is making reader entertainment into reader exploitation.  Will Ultred EVER reach and retake Bebbanburg?  Or will that be left up to Ultred Jr., the Fighting Monk and the Saxon II Tales?  Enough is enough.  This series could have one more good book if Cornwell will finally get Ultred to Bebbanburg.

Anyone looking to find government and military secrets will not find any in this book and quite rightly so.<br /><br />The normally intense training for Navy Seals is generally described as well as some of the special training for this mission.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|No, this CD doesnt need another review. I agree. BUT... Im doing it anyway. Why? Cause KISS is making excellent, first class hard ROCK music these days! In my personal opinion, they always have and Ive always been a fan. But major fan or not, the last 4 releases from these guys have really been impressive! They are actually sounding better and better the older they get!!! No? Go back and listen to<br />PSYCHO CIRCUS<br />KLASSICS<br />SONIC BOOM<br />...and now MONSTER<br />Im blown away guys. When most other bands keep putting out music LONG after they shouldnt, and even their biggest fans lose respect, you guys just keep showin the others how its done. Thank you: Paul, Gene and all the other members past & presnt. KISS is still a MONSTER to be reckoned with. Buy this Album!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|A few spots were a bit difficult but this game is worth it.  The hints help properly when stuck.  I have seen some games that either have useless hints or hint feature not available when you are REALLY stuck.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|I was really looking forward to this book, and Mr. Russinovich did not disappoint.  Right from the start, you are invited into the mining cart and are then propelled, brakeless, down the track, at the mercy of the many twists and turns the story takes.<br /><br />As a an IT Pro with 20+ years experience, I shudder to think just how much realism this book is drenched in.  Highly recommended.

0060594896|5.0|I'm a 32 year old single gal alone in the big city. A few years back I hit a rough patch in my life and wasn't sure what to do next. I felt lost. Then, someone gifted me the book \\"Don't Sweat the Small Stuff\\" and it totally transformed my perspective on everything that had been happening in my life. My experience with that book led me to read \\"The Secret\\" then I watched the video ... While already in a more positive mind frame and attracting the tools I needed into my life, I came across The Success Principles while browsing a local Barnes & Nobles. My typical MO is to grab a bunch of books and magazines and find a cozy chair or table somewhere and start reading pieces of each hoping that one will capture my attention and draw me in ... I had made my way through a few duds when I picked the next to last book up from my pile. I started flipping through and reading pieces here and there; this book began speaking to me immediately. I didn't know what I was looking for, but I knew that this was it! I felt like it sort of wrapped up all the loose ends from my previous experiences and reading and concreted some principles I had only just \\"touched\\" on before.<br /><br />Fast forward from my rough patch a few years back and I'm 1 hair away from finishing my BAAS, then I'll be getting my RPA then my masters. There are no more rough patches, only opportunities. My life has evolved socially, financially, emotionally ... Now I don't wonder where I can go, I wonder where I will choose to go next and what my next adventure will be. I have huge plans and I'm excited about life!<br /><br />I love the way Jack encourages in a \\"no judgment\\" way for each of us to take responsibility for the things that have happened or are happening in our lives. If we concede that everything is out of our control then we give up b/c we believe there is nothing we can do, and that's not reality. The reality is you can do ANYTHING.<br /><br />The principles Jack teaches are so simple, yet so profound.The only thing I'm left wondering is WHY these important life lessons aren't being passed down by parents and grand parents? Why did I have to read a book in my 30s to be privy to such beautiful pearls?<br /><br />I highly recommend everyone give this book a go and if you believe in what you read, pass these gems along to others and the next generation.<br /><br />Truly, reading this book was like finally waking up and upon my waking, Jack was there to say \\"Good morning. Welcome to your life.\\"<br /><br />Thank you Jack Canfield!
B000000OU6|3.0|In 1994, during another hiatus from GNR', Slash grew tired of waiting to play some music so he formed a side-project named Snakepit to further his ambitions.<br /><br />Formed with an all-star cast that included Gilby Clarke, Mike Inez(of Alice in Chains fame) and Matt Sorum, Slash brought in relative unknown singer Eric Dover to handle the vocal duties. When I saw who played in the record, I was immediately impressed and thought how could this not be amazing? Well quite simply, this album isn't all that it's cracked up to be. The song writting is iffy at best, and I have never been a fan of Matt Sorum's drumming style or approach(which is a personal issue, not anything anyone else may care about). Even with this gripes about this record, there are some serious gems on here as well. I really dug \\"Doin' Fine\\", \\"Beggar's and Hangers On\\", \\"Some City Ward\\" and \\"I Hate Everybody but You\\".<br /><br />If your a monster fan of Slash, or you just really like all things related to GNR', you may want to give this record a couple spins. I won't say you'll be disappointed, but this definitely isn't GNR'.
B009B50QOU|3.0|Ok album. Certain songs are great, but other songs feel like filler-songs. I definitely didn't like the production quality of the audio; it felt too produced for my liking.

0316212377|3.0|I have read all of Banks' Culture novels and was anxiously waiting to read this one, but it has been somewhat of a disappointment. Definitely not the best of his Culture novels. I think that Use of Weapons is still the best, followed probably by Matter. The Player of Games and Surface Detail are quite good too.<br /><br />In this novel  the Culture Minds play a key role, somewhat similarly to Excession, and I think that the novel gets weaker because of this.  The Minds are inconceivably powerful machines but they don't seem to have very interesting or very well developed personalities. They all sound basically as bratty arrogant and bright teen agers having fun, which is all rather entertaining for a while, but in the end it gets a little dull and repetitive. The only human (or humanoids) characters in the novel, the Gzilt Vyr Cossont, and the Culture's QiRia are not terribly interesting either.  As a contrast, the best of the Culture novels, Use of Weapons, features strong and very interesting human characters.<br /><br />The main flaw (and it's a big one) of this novel is as follows: The Gzilt civilization, which is at the same technological level as the Culture, is about to Sublime, that is to \\"transcend\\" to a (apparently) non-material (superior)  level of existence. Throughout the Galaxy, civilizations are supposed to Sublime only when they get to a very advanced level of development. And yet the Gzilt is a militarized society on which its politicians embark in all sort of low-level political intrigues and even mass assassinations. Which  a) would prove that the Gzilt are far from mature enough to deserve to sublime and b) all the political intrigue and assassinations make no sense whatsoever a few days before the Sublimation event.<br /><br />An additional flaw is that by now, after having written more than a dozen Culture novels, it would seem that Mr. Banks has really nothing new to say about the Culture.

B007GCY8FS|2.0|I've read every Reacher book and even the few short stories associated with this wonderful super character.  I don't think the latest opus was even written by Lee Child; if it was, then I don't look forward to further books in this series--which makes me very sad.  I'd been waiting for the publication of this book for several months, and one of my sons bought it for me for my birthday last month.<br /><br />I read several pages before realizing that I was uncomfortable and even confused by the convoluted narrative.  The characters seemed to be coming from nowhere, and I kept waiting for Reacher to do something--and for the author to clear things up for me.  I plodded through and got some meager entertainment here and there, and then the book was over.<br /><br />The only memorable part of the book came at the very end, when Reacher revealed how a person could speak nonstop for one minute without using the letter \\"A.\\"<br /><br />I actually felt cheated when I closed my Kindle after reading the final lines last night.  Bummer.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I would give this a five star review if not for one problem. as you progress through the game everything gets more and more expensive but that is reasonable. the first problem in expansion is that it is very expensive. I would be fine if just opening the area cost only over a hundred thouseand coins that seems reasonable. but after that you also have to pay a lot more to clear foliage. I would be fine if it didn't cost much sp when adding to clearing or &quot;exploring&quot; the area and cleening it out it would be at a reasonable amount of coins that would only take a few days to save up. but to clear foliage adding to expiring you have to pay between 500.000 coins and 1.000.000 coins that can take a few weeks to save up adding on to the expenses of breeding for new dragons and food so that you can evolve the dragons. it takes a long time and gets frustrating after a while. I cant buy coins because to get you somewhere in expanding you have to pay about a 1.000 gold. also some blocks or areas you cant clear at all. so in the middle island one block in the corner wont let you clear it and the smack middle block of a smaller island cant expand so ot was a waste of money and time trying to clear that island becouse if I cant clear the middle block I have no room. otherwise the game is great. you just need to ignore (if you have a kindle fire) every time it says that the game isn't responding. each time I click wait and it works fine. so ignore that. the dragons are cute and I love how some dragons are rarer than others so everyone doesn't have the same dragons. either way the game is cute and fun just really expensive coinswise.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Have been an avid fan of ELO and Jeff Lynne for many years.  While I wasn't in love with this album in the first listen like Armchair Theater, it did win me over on the second listen.<br />I think Jeff's voice is hauntingly beautiful in \\"If I Loved You\\" and my kids are jumping around to \\"Let it Rock\\".  I think many of us fans really like Jeff's original compositions and of course would<br />love more of that.  For now, drift your mind back to the 50\\"s and enjoy.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|As a history teacher who ahs a great interest in the upheaval oof the second World War I am very impressed with the historic accuracy of this book. Follet has intertwined the significant events with the human story of his characters. He makes the reader very aware of the human tragedy that was the war.

B00968THRE|5.0|This album truly has a majestic sound to it. There is something for everyone, the lyrics are hypnotic and raw and her voice is blended well and used in new and creative ways. Ellie really put a lot of heart into this album to smooth it out by making sure it highlights her strengths an artist. Almost a new kind of edge with a flavorful mix of Enigma meets Robyn. In a word, this album is on the same level as Janelle Monae and Darren Hayes. An artist who like to separate herself from the norm by delivering a sound you can dance to, sing to, and even songs that can make you cry. I truly was blown away with the experience of this album because it's actually quite better than the first because she's found her soft spot and I believe this album will put her on the map in the USA big time. Lights was her breakout hit, Halcyon is the beginning to a long chapter of bigger and better hits that people turn up the radio for. I'm so excited for the things to happen in her career! The perfect accessory for the gym, club, and ballads to relax to after a long day at work. You will absolutely love this album. A must buy for anyone who loves fun, hip, and original songs!

B0085776BG|5.0|Red Tails was an excellent movie, The time period the piece was written in was well thought out and depicted. The Film had an authentic look and feel to it. The actors were excellent and of course acted their parts superbly well. As it pertains to the theme and storyline those were well thought out and the film was not to predictable so it kept our attention from start to finish. a totally enjoyable film!
B005CA4SL0|5.0|Who says old movies can't look good?  Don't come here for a plot summary or my opinions on the cast and acting. Yes, there is a great cast and DeNiro still in his acting prime while Jessica Lange is growing into hers and Nick Nolte still a highly valued actor in his own right and a young Juliette Lewis starts on her road to stardom.  Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck do  small cameos reprising their presence from the original film<br /><br /> This is just a review of the transfer and remastering of this film on Blu Ray.  Since I have not seen any other versions of Cape Fear on Blu Ray I do not know how good or bad the old ones were.  However, this Universal release shows just how good a transfer can be when the company puts some effort into creating a decent product.  Unlike many transfers to blu ray which are only format transfers with no audio or video improvements, Cape Fear is a fine example of what can be done with older films.<br /><br />The video transfer is great in all ways.  Beautiful color saturation and desaturation where appropriate, absolutely no grain that I could see, nor artifacts and aliasing.  Some of the matte work showing off a red sky was obvious to me but that was not the fault of the transfer at all.<br /><br />The audio is now DTSHD 5.1 that shows off a fine front stage for the music score.  More dialogue driven than most might expect, the use of the rears is most infrequent but some audio panning along with a touch of discreet directionality during the thunderstorm is still present.  Audio levels are finely balanced so set your volume and watch an older film that has legs even after all these years.<br /><br />While I do not also have the standard def version of Cape Fear, all I can say is that if you liked the movie, which I did, than you won't regret getting this remastered version on Blu Ray.  Props to Universal  to giving us the quality we paid for.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksansfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

B008OHV4PG|5.0|Fall 2012 is the \\"season of the Young\\" (well Neil Young, anyway), and I seem to be immersed in \\"things Young\\", going through his new autobiography in both hardbound book and the audiobook version (read by Keith Carradine). Now comes this Bluray disc of the 2012 feature film/concert documentary \\"Neil Young Journeys\\", directed by Jonathan Demme. This is either the third, or fifth (depending on how you define \\"film\\") Demme/Young film and - as Demme points out in  the bonus features - completely different from the previous projects. And it's wonderful.<br /><br />The majority of the 89-minutes consists of Young performing during the last two nights of his \\"Le Noise\\" solo tour at the historic Massey Hall in Toronto, Canada (where Young was born). But Demme wanted to show more about Young so he rented a 1956 Ford Crown Victoria (Young is a car buff as well as a huge Lionel train fan) and had him start in Omemee, the town in northern Ontario where Young grew up (they moved from Toronto early on), following his brother Bob (in another vintage car), Demme drove with him to Toronto. They visit sites important to Young in his early life and Young tells some funny stories. But, as I said, the 12 songs performed in the concerts (the two concerts were edited together) form the nucleolus of the film. In addition to the songs on his 2011 album, we get two previously unreleased songs and as well as the \\"hits\\", including \\"After The Gold Rush\\", \\"My My Hey Hey\\" and \\"Ohio\\" - the latter being embellished by film clips of the Kent State shootings and photos of the four students killed. Demme uses some odd camera techniques and on two songs (including \\"Down by the River\\") he uses a tiny camera mounted on the mic stand and we get close-ups of Young's teeth!!! The instrumentation is varied as well with Young on both acoustic and electric guitar as well as piano and organ.  The film itself is great!<br /><br />But, those who have seen the film will want the DVD or BD as well because of the bonuses. There is a short (six-minute) \\"making of\\" featurette but the real meat is in the TWO \\"conversations with Young and Demme\\", each running about 35 minutes. First comes the Slamdance Festival screening where Demme does most of the talking and it's about filmmaking, though Young does make some comments. The better one is the \\"conversation\\" held at the 92nd St. Y in New York where the interviewer (oddly, never identified - even in the credits) moves the discussion to Young's music. We hear his outspoken thoughts about the \\"quality of sound\\" and how \\"MP3s suck\\". By the way, both \\"conversations\\" are \\"edited\\" for expletives. Some of the same stories are repeated in both \\"conversations\\" but each has its own rewards.<br /><br />This is not only a must for Young fans but a fine introduction to those who only know Young from his \\"hits\\" on the radio.<br /><br />Note that the bonuses are the same on both the DVD and Bluray.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"nuses.

B009A3NGF4|5.0|I could not be happier with the Deluxe Edition.  Awesome follow-up to Sigh No More.  Mumford keeps rockin' and banjo-ing!
B004LWZWGK|2.0|(Great opening sequence aside) Takes place eight years after The Dark Knight and Bruce Wayne is moping and feeling sorry for himself throughout 90% of the film (Batman is in maybe 10-15% of the film).  The entire canvas of the film is epic and themes are weighty, but the script is just too choppy and all over the place.  A couple of great action sequences doesn't make up for almost an 2 and a half hours of boredom.<br />You'll read a lot of \\"Good\\" reviews and most will start off, \\"It's no Batman Begins or The Dark Knight but...\\"<br />Well guess what, you build me up with those great films, I'm gonna expect as good if not better for the finale.  This just felt so disconnected.
B000W237RE|2.0|I do love the allman bros but the album itself was too full of just jammin for me! That's my fault though, I should've looked at the times of all the songs before purchasing
B009DP9D6A|4.0|Many would say that this album isn't as great at 4x4, however I think it's even better.  Rock-infused songs like Professional Griefers along with smooth sounds from 'there will be coffee' to 'October', this album has a great mix of soothing, rocking, and your traditional trance beats from the master, Deadmau5!

B007A2O3FO|5.0|We watched this movie last night on an impulse and found it to be a real treasure; the scenery, story, directing and the acting all work harmoniously together to create a wonderful evening's entertainment. The fine British cast brings their usual expertise to bear on this story of a young boy who is sent to live with his grandmother for a time only to discover there was much to learn about his ancestral home and his family.<br /><br />We found the movie to be well paced and free of any seriously slow spots and enjoyed our journey of discovery with young Tolly as he discovers his house and his family's history interactively moving back and forth in time. Make no mistake, this is a ghost story told in a delightfully charming manner. It provides a very enjoyable evening for the entire family and I recommend it highly. Although we watched it initially on streaming video I am planning on buying the DVD for my permanent collection.
0446573027|5.0|I wish I could have put 10 here... It was a page turner and my husband and I couldn't put it down!!!! If at all possible, read this one!

034553056X|5.0|This book was the same for both my husband and I. Took less than a week for both of us to read. Why? Because we couldn't put the book down. I can't say that there was a dull moment in the whole thing. The characters were true until the end. The difference between my husband's read and mine was that he was trying to figure out the plot before he read it. He said it had some great twists that really kept him interested. I on the other hand, read it on the edge of my chair so to speak, and just enjoyed it to the end. Thanks John for writing another great novel.

B003TSEEDY|2.0|This book was written by a middle schooler!  It was very un-satisfactory and elementary in nature.  The author wrote like a 6th grader.  Would not recommend to anyone.
0375714839|5.0|A light rendition of a seriously intense situation. This woman's childhood story was a window into a world I was oblivious to while growing up during the same timeframe but considerably different situations. The art added to the tone and humor of the stories. The artist's talent shone as brightly as the writing.<br /><br />I received this book in perfect condition, as promised.
0316228532|4.0|The Casual Vacancy generated a ton of speculation and excitement as people looked forward to JK Rowling's next literary effort. I was very excited when I downloaded my copy to my Kindle and sat down to enjoy her work. The book is a sort of parable, as JK is fond of developing stories that operate on several levels.  At its most simplistic level, its about the death of a town council member and the ripple effects that death has on the members of his small community.  On another level it is a study of the politics and infighting of small town governance.  On yet another level, its a closer look at the inner workings of relationships rife with physical and emotional abuse, and the co-dependency that fuels these dysfunctional families.  And ultimately, it is a concrete demonstration of the evil that occurs when the village has no interest in helping to raise its neglected children.  Is it a happy story?  Not really.  Is it an interesting character study?  Absolutely.  You come to understand and sympathize with the members of JK's community, some of them against your better judgement.  JK Rowling has an amazing talent for writing and bringing these odd ensemble characters to life.

B006TF6WAM|4.0|I was a bit reluctant to write a review as it was a much more intense personal experience reading this book than I expected. I didn't relate to the characters nor the story but I could very much relate, to my surprise, to the main relationship in the book. Reading this story, which I thoroughly enjoyed, helped me to evaluate my own priorities and where I could be heading if I don't get things in order.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|... then they've totally missed the point of this series. The series, for me, is about being different, not caring, and telling everyone to jump off that cliff everyone is so fond of.<br /><br />Daria is awesome! I'm very happy with getting the series, with or without the music soundtrack. It's just as I remember it when I first watched it. Fantastic!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I just saw the Avengers last night on Blu Ray.  It was my first time to see the film.  I must say, you really get your money's worth in terms of running time, effects, and some of the most amazing action I've ever seen.  The movie starts with a bang and never lets up.  The fights are terrific, with the best ones being between allies, especially the Hulk vs. Thor.  The special effects are top notch.  There is excellent use of humor throughout.  For people familiar with the Marvel universe the characters are all true to their comic book counterparts.  This would be a good demo disk for your home theater system, especially the sub woofer.  All in all, an excellent movie and a groundbreaker in event movies.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I never write reviews, but this is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Very original and thought provoking.  Hopefully the author keeps them coming for a while!

1579129129|5.0|I ordered this book after viewing the article on it in Discover magazine and was instantly blown away by the content. There are so many examples in this book and not just those of the common variety (2-headed calf skull!). Each skull is accompanied by scientific classification, a picture of a living counterpart, information about the animal and occasionally an interesting tidbit by Dudley himself. Chapters are also headed by an article pertaining to skull history, information, ect. The book is also seperated into types such as birds, mammals, reptiles, and so on each with amazing photographs of the skulls themselves. Besides this being an informative and delightful book to look at, it outdoes itself in being a great artists reference (which was my main reason for purchasing)especially for little know skulls. Thank you Dudley and Simon for sharing these wonderful creatures with us!

Don't want to have to purchase the same movie 3-4 times just the get the all the special features.

I can buy the combo pack and burn the DVD copy to my iTunes or 2. buy the Blu-ray only copy and then buy the iTunes copy.  Solution 1, the digital copy is not as good and Solution 2, I pay twice.  Why can't WB give us a code that can be used one time at our choice (iTunes, Amazon, or UV)?
0439023521|5.0|A lot of people at first told me that the movie was coming out in theaters soon and i really wanted to read it before i actually saw the movie.

I'm not a very good reader and i barely read but I'm really glad i read this book!<br />It has a lot of excitement and fear in it but that's what makes you want to keep on reading it. I saw the movie but the book in my opinion was way better. It had very good descriptive words and feelings that made you want to know what could happen next. It also has a very good love story twist to it.<br />If you are wondering what the book is about its about a girl named Katniss. They live in a society where there is different districts and she happens to be in 12th district. A certain time of the year they pick 2 people to play in the \\"hunger games\\" which is when they fight until one person is a live. What happens is they pick her little sister and katniss doesn't want her sister to play so she volunteers herself, making the crowd go crazy. Then shows you how and what happens.<br />All in all i would read this book so many times in a row and it has a very good sequel to go with it! I actually read this book in about one week, and I'm glad I have! I would recommend this book to anyone even if they don't like to read.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|As a history buff this caught my eye, don't remember a lot of buzz on it, but I'm a James McAvoy fan. Great cast, Colm Meaney (another fave), Kevin Kline, Tom Wilkinson, Alexis Bleidel (Rory!), and  Robin Wright. The women don't have a lot to do, Robin Wright has far the meatiest role but mostly gets to look somber. Nonetheless, an interesting side to the Lincoln assassination, The co-conspirators didn't get a lot of press, at least not now. It mainly is an interesting study into the US attitude post-war and post assassination - vengeful and rationalizing. A good, could have been better, antebellum tale, it may suffer from an overdose of understated earnestness at worst.
1476712042|1.0|I'm not even going to complain about the dysfunctional relationship this book centers around (even though their dysfunctionality was ridiculous and annoying), because I know that the author's goal was to write a book about a relationship between two flawed characters. I wouldn't want to read a book about perfect characters anyway. But if you're going to create flawed characters, something about them has to be likable or interesting. Readers have to care about what happens to them. Travis and Abby are one-dimensional, and there's nothing about them that made me want to root for them as a couple or even as human beings.<br /><br />At the end of reading this book, I can't even think of an adjective to give Abby. She was that boring. The author wanted to paint her as a small-town girl trying to create a new life for herself after growing up the daughter of notorious poker player. The problem with this is that readers never are able to fully understand what she had to go through as a young adult. Her father does pop up later in the book, but by that point, I had already stopped caring. We needed more concrete details about the struggles in her past life to really care about her as a character and understand her motivations, particularly in the beginning when she doesn't want to commit to Travis. Little comments from America here and there about Abby's past felt empty and tacked on.<br /><br />The pacing of the book was terrible as well. It goes in circles for the first half, and then the story goes on a ridiculous tangent that involes Vegas and the Mob. What's intended to be threats to Travis and Abby's relationship aren't believable at all. Travis even points out the repeition in the story at the end.<br /><br />On top of that, there's the scripted dialogue and ridiculous names and nicknames (America? Shepley? PIGEON??).<br /><br />I hope this book serves as proof to people that we still need publishers and good editors.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Fantastic follow-up of a great story. Kvothe continues his saga and we learn more of the fae and a bigger peek at his mysterious background. I cant wait for the next one!

B00940XIGU|2.0|I don't understand why this album was even made; it has something like 7 new songs on it,  but the rest are found on either Nothing But the Beat or Nothing But the Beat - the Electronic Album, both of which I own. I haven't even looked at One Love to see if anything has been self-sampled off of that album. What's up with that, Dave? Seems like you're pissing on your loyal fans by offering them new music intermixed with a lot of the old; it's only the new fans that profit here, since they can pick up one album that effectively spans the last two. If nothing else, you should have released an EP of the new stuff alongside this album, which as far as I can see is the best way to serve both old and new fans alike; after all, I like your sh*t, but I am not about to shell out $13 for an album that is half filled with music I already own.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I enjoyed the Alien series but was warned not to have great expectations of this prequel, so I was pleasantly surprised that I quite enjoyed it.<br /><br />With any fantasy movie, and this is a space one, you know that it can't be taken too seriously, but at the same time the story and events have to be somewhat credible, otherwise they becomes ridiculous. This movie vacillated between the believable and the ludicrous. However, I was willing to accept the ludicrous things, like the absurd lack of the characters' caution at every turn, because without it, they wouldn't get into danger and there would be no story.<br /><br />There were other unbelievable things that were just annoying, mostly to do with the attempts to predict technology that could be conceivably developed by the movie's 2090s setting. Most were fantastic but could be reasoned to be possible, but at the same time for they were displayed next to characters and things firmly set in the present, like eye-glasses, or balding or really low-tech weaponry, such as a WW2 flame gun.<br /><br />Like another reviewer, after watching the original Swedish `Dragon Tattoo' series, I had great expectations of Noomi Rapace, which were wholly unfulfilled.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with all its flaws, Ridley Scott  knows how to put a movie together with sound and pictures to produce tension and excitement and I think he's succeeded again.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Ms. Moorjani's story is one that is worth more than one read.  The first read is just to get through the story.  I would suggest subsequent reads to fully grasp the lessons that she is sharing with the world.<br />I first heard about this book after watching Dr. Dyer's latest PBS special.  Ms. Moorjani was a featured guest.  Her story was interesting, but I was not immediately motivated to purchase her book.  Then I read Dr. Dyer's book, \\"Wishes Fulfilled,\\" where he mentions in depth Ms. Moorjani's amazing story.<br />Her story was so fantastical that I couldn't put the book down for hours at a time.  I found her descriptions and honesty very familiar and refreshing. There are elements of her story that I related to on a certain level.  How we shouldn't be so hard on ourselves resonated especially strong.<br />I would not look at what her story tells as anything new, but it does provide information in a new way.  As more and more individuals who have experienced such near death events are publishing more, you see a specific pattern emerging.  Ms. Moorjani's book is another thread in that tapestry of truth.
0307744434|4.0|I really did enjoy this book.  The writing is lovely and the beginning and the end are quite good.  I did feel a bit like shaking the characters in the middle, yelling \\"ask the obvious question!\\"  But overall it is worth the middle bit.  Recommended.
B0076UXKDG|1.0|The battery grip by Pixel costs only $77.20 at the time of this review, and it is said by one youtube reviewer to perform just as well as the Nikon grip does.  Perhaps the generic brand product would not feel as great on your palm, or cosmetically match the body of the Nikon D800 as well... but that doesn't justify the Nikon MB-D12 to cost $397, (5.14 X the price that of the Pixel battery grip). I would love to have the Nikon grip, but I refuse to buy the MB-D12 above the $150 price point, that's already about twice the cost of the generic brand.  If Amazon wants to sell me the MB-D12 at the current price point, I need to see what makes the MB-D12 5.14 times better, or at the very least 4 times better in VALUE.
159315724X|5.0|I selected the Einstein quotation to serve as the title of this review because I became convinced long ago that people and the lives they live tend to be the result of the decisions they make. In casinos and in competitive athletics, for example, individuals can be \\"on a roll\\" or in what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi characterizes as \\"flow.\\" We can't miss, we can't lose, the force is with us. However, that same force can also produce negative, sometimes disastrous results.<br /><br />Alice Schroeder selected The Snowball as a title for her biography of Warren Buffett because, when he was a boy growing up in Omaha, he observed a large ball-like shape rolling down a hill, gaining both size and speed as it moved along. He immediately recognized its implicit power. Positive compound interest remains among his core principles. For millions of others, negative compound interest (e.g. on credit card debt, \\"upside-down\\" mortgages) has created very serious problems.<br /><br />For me, Darren Hardy's most important point in this book is this: All of the decisions people make (however \\"small\\" they may be) can have positive results if those decisions are guided and informed by what he calls The Compound Effect principle. Conversely, a minor cut that becomes infected and is neglected could eventually result in major surgery, perhaps even an amputation. In fact, Hardy insists - and I agree - there are no \\"minor\\" or \\"small\\" decisions if their potential implications and consequences are ignored.  These are among the subjects that Hardy addresses in his book:<br /><br />o  How to win--every time! The No. 1 strategy to achieve any goal and triumph over any competitor, even if they're smarter, more talented or more experienced.<br />o  Eradicate bad habits that are preventing or delaying success (however defined)<br />o  Install and master the few key disciplines required for major breakthroughs of achievement<br />o  Motivate yourself to do what you really don't want to do...but must do, to succeed.<br />o  Initiate the \\"elusive, awesome force of momentum\\" and then sustain it, especially during hard times<br />o  Adopt and then accelerate the secrets of superachievers<br /><br />At the conclusion of Chapters 1-6, he provides an admonition to  \\"Put the Compound Effect to Work for You\\" by following through on a \\"Summary of Action Steps.\\" I commend Hardy for his frequent, insistent, at times passionate reminders of how difficult, REALLY difficult it is to replace bad habits (e.g. purchases to accommodate instant gratification) and bad influences (especially people). I presume to add my own voice: All of his recommendations are crystal clear and easy to understand. (There isn't a single brilliant insight among them, nor does he make any such claim.) It is also true that all of his recommendations require painful self-sacrifices as well as a steadfast, indeed tenacious commitment.  He agrees with the Yoda: \\"Do or do not. There is no try.\\"<br /><br />All that said, there is some \\"good news\\" worth sharing that will provide a context, a frame-of-reference for personal sacrifices, replacing bad habits and bad influences with good ones, detailed documentation of spending, fear, pain (if not terror), embarrassment, and frustration. From a source I do not recall, there is what is identified as \\"The Magic Penny\\" example of The Compound Effect. Here's the situation: You are given a choice between $3-million in cash now or a single penny that doubles in value each day during a 31-day period. Which would you take? Hardy discusses it and other examples in Chapter 1. My point now is that there are no magic pennies, silver bullets, etc. However, there is wisdom of priceless value and much of it is in this unassuming but cordial as well as hard-hitting book. If you aren't as determined to achieve success (however defined) as much as Darren Hardy is determined to help you do it, then ignore his advice await divine intervention.o succeed.<br />o  Initiate the \\"elusive, awesome force of momentum\\" and then sustain it, especially during hard times<br />o  Adopt and then accelerate the secrets of superachievers<br /><br />At the conclusion of Chapters 1-6, he provides an admonition to  \\"Put the Compound Effect to Work for You\\" by following through on a \\"Summary of Action Steps.\\" I commend Hardy for his frequent, insistent, at times passionate reminders of how difficult, REALLY difficult it is to replace bad habits (e.g. purchases to accommodate instant gratification) and bad influences (especially people).

B008Y1YFNU|3.0|I've listened to the album twice now and am a little disappointed. The one single they released is pretty good, but other then that it's just OK, hence the reason for three stars. I'm a huge fan so I don't give this review lightly. The way I judge an album is this - if I'm not passionate about at least 70% of the songs then I'm not going to listen to it. There's so much available out there and so little time, I'm just not going to spend my time listening to something that's not above my threshold. You may have different standards, but those are mine.

0307341550|4.0|Sharp Objects is a novel about a Chicago reporter, Camille Preaker. Her assignment: to visit her very small hometown in Missouri and come back with a career-making story of the recent murder of two young girls. However, despite her knowledge of the town, Camille may not be the best person for the job. Camille is a self-mutilating cutter who hasn't been long out of a psychiatric hospital, she drinks large amounts of alcohol to cope with her painful memories of her youth and the death of her younger sister. And the reunion with the rest of her family is just as troublesome ... there's Camille's half-sister, the beautiful bully Amma. And her cold and very un-motherly mother, who come to find out was strangely close to both of the murdered girls ... In the end, Flynn's novel is not just a great thriller, it's a searing portrayal of the damage a dangerously narcissistic mother can inflict on her children.

1455502758|5.0|I've read a few of Mr. Hitchens books and sadly, it seems, there will be no more books, articles and essays to look forward too. I still have many, many readings to absorb from him (as I have only just started) but like a good meal, there will be an empty plate at some point and no more to relish.<br /><br />I almost wanted to wait to read Mortality and first read everything else Christopher had put to print... but waiting is not one of my strong points. I'm glad I read this last memoir. It's a beautiful, quick read that unfolds easily and lets you see through the eyes of a fearless human being with his own demise dancing before him. There is a hope for life and yet an acceptance of the inevitable in this book. The journalistic, poetic and sometimes humorous witness to ones own demise never becomes self pitying or sentimental through Christopher's eyes. Instead we see a man never squinting or shying away from his blinding and encompassing mortality. The photo of Christopher on the back cover evokes what is inside: An intense human being knowing his time is up, and looking that \\"end\\" straight in the face.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Battleship is an ok movie if you have nothing better to do. Don't expect much, but it is worth watching. It is just another movie where the loser (but the film throws in a couple things so you know he can do better) proves that he can save the day and gets the girl. Do expect a plot or everything to make logical sense, just realize you are watching it because nothing better is available.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|I bought this on its release (vinyl) to give as a present to my Uncle and Aunt in Belgium in about 1970. Well they had given me a Ringo Star album, because they were sure it was the kind of music young people (14) liked. Since I was over my John Sebastian phase (Woodstock) and immersing myself into the likes of Hawkwind, Pink Fairies, Chicken Shack and Groundhogs-they were slightly off the mark. So I bought them BOTW because it was the kind of music old farts (50) would like. And they did. Well mainstream music in Belgium then was bad and I think they had not gotten excited about any new music since the Belgian nun hit the charts with a rup-a pum-pum. So fast forward to 2012 and this is in my CD collection (as are the above mentioned) and it is not a bad album. Over produced-A tad! But some fine songs \\"Only Living Boy in New York\\" Baby Driver\\" and \\"The Boxer\\". \\"I'd Rather be a Swan\\" is a duck and BOTW is a classic, over production. But it deserves its mantle as a classic-so once upon a pair of wheels I'm gone. And the Belgians, no I could never convince them that Groundhogs \\"Split\\" was the equal of this. Cannot win 'em all.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Hmmm, where to start... I stopped watching this movie after 15 minutes. [spoilers] Whty would a company invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to build a ship to fly to another star system just to land at the first place they can find? Why not sending robots into the newly discovered location? Why putting people into the team that will definitely cause trouble... It's all an illogical mess.<br /><br />The good thing: The visuals are stunning :)<br /><br />Don't waste your money!
1449410243|2.0|Let me start out by saying I like the Oatmeal.  He has some pretty good comics, to be sure.  Unfortunately, this book was a bit of a disappointment.  While yes, it was still the same art style and comedy style I'd grown to like, its focusing solely on cats as the subject matter leaves something to be desired.  The jokes basically feel the same most of the time: \\"Wow these cats are sure wacky and also psychotic little love machines.\\"  And that's boring and excludes some of my favorite jokes of his, like the \\"My Daily Lie\\" comic he had.  I was looking for better, and...unfortunately...this book was largely a disappointment from the comedic front.  Buy it if you REALLY like his cat comics, but otherwise, it's not worth a purchase.

B006AN78XS|5.0|In \\"Midnight in Paris\\", we follow Gil Pender (played by Owen Wilson), a Hollywood screenwriter and aspiring novelist. He, his girlfriend (Rachel McAdams), and his in-laws are visiting Paris. While the others prefer to shop and visit museums, Pender is enchanted with exploring the city on foot. One night, Pender loses his way and is transported to a different era where he meets famed writers and artists of Paris's \\"Golden Age.\\" On his journeys to the past, he learns many life lessons and finally finds the inspiration he'd been looking for all along.<br /><br />While Owen Wilson can be hit-or-miss for me, I found him to be unexpectedly brilliant in this role. I liked how his time traveling expeditions were completely unexplained (and not written off to daydreams or fantasies). The crux of the story lies in his meetings with writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and artists like Picasso. At the same time you don't have to be extremely knowledgeable about all of these historical figures to appreciate the film- simply the idea of being in an age of heightened creativity, in a European city, is well played out on the screen. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and highly recommend it!

So, this book and the 5th one could really be considered one book broken into 2....and this one does leave out a lot of characters, but the story continues (just told through different people at times) and the old characters I love are still going in the 5th book.  I suppose if I had to wait 6 years to read the 5th book I would have been a bit upset, but the book is fantastic!  Don't believe the haters, read and let read.
B005S9ELM6|2.0|\\"Argo f*** yourself.\\" You can go ahead and pack up your things; you've just experienced the most enjoyable part of Ben Affleck's \\"Argo.\\" In all seriousness, \\"Argo\\" has the precise formula to be a sure fire Oscar winner. Affleck went to great lengths to make the film look aged and grainy while there were plenty of bad 70s hairstyles, bushy porn star moustaches, and unbuttoned shirts with huge collars that scream \\"in case of emergency disco dancing pop up.\\" The camera work deserves some accolades, as well. Near the beginning of the film, there's a scene with a helicopter where you feel like you're riding right along with the pilot. The shot starts at ground level and then slowly shoots up into the air.<br /><br />The performances are pretty strong all around. Affleck portrays a man in purgatory; not only is he in charge of six people's lives but he's also separated from his wife who has custody of their son. Affleck's Tony Mendez character seems mostly emotionally absent the entire film and rightfully so. The six Americans stranded in Iran all portray panic and anxiousness very well. John Goodman as make-up effects artist John Chambers is fantastic as is Alan Arkin as movie director Lester Siegel. Goodman is funny and charming right from the start while Arkin has this no BS type of humor that comes with all his years in the movie business. His quick wit, particularly during the meeting him and Affleck have regarding the rights to \\"Argo,\\" instantly makes him the highlight of the film.<br /><br />Ever since Bryan Cranston became a household name in \\"Breaking Bad,\\" he's been popping up in a lot of movies; \\"Red Tails,\\" \\"John Carter,\\" \\"Madagascar 3,\\" \\"Rock of Ages,\\" \\"Total Recall,\\" and now \\"Argo\\" in 2012 alone. He usually brings that same intensity you love him for in \\"Breaking Bad\\" to every role he has even if the project he's a part of isn't very good. \\"Argo\\" may be his best effort film-wise so far. He's just so good as a man who has no other options; when his character is at the end of his rope. His form of frustrated panic is outstanding and thanks to the magic of R-rated films has a chance to be completely unfiltered here.<br /><br />What's disappointing about \\"Argo\\" is that it's really dull. Speaking as someone who isn't really interested in the subject matter of the film, any interest at all was solely based on the feedback it's received. Any scenes revolving around developing the fake movie and that include John Chambers or Lester Siegel are immediately entertaining, but that's obviously secondary. There's a lot of sitting around and waiting and drinking. How Tony Mendez drinks so much without showing any signs of feeling it is kind of astounding.<br /><br />Seeing the mechanics of it all as it's happening gets pretty redundant. There's this blue balls mentality to the film where it teases so many things that could happen but then they don't or it strings you along for so long and then is just like \\"Oh, nevermind.\\" You can only watch people talking, having things go wrong, and them scrambling to figure out a last minute solution so many times before you figure out where things are headed. It really seems difficult having knowledge of the events the film is based on and how everything turns out and still being able to enjoy the film. It seems like knowing the answer to the riddle beforehand would make it less enjoyable.<br /><br />While \\"Argo\\" will more than likely be nominated for best picture at The Academy Awards that doesn't mean it's going to cater to everyone or that anyone who sees it is going to fall in love with it. If it wasn't for the performances of John Goodman, Alan Arkin, and Bryan Cranston, it would actually be pretty boring. How bad the fake sci-fi movie seems pulls you in more than the horrible events going on in Iran.<br /><br />Some moments are tense, but many are portraying it as this overwhelming sensation that never lets up during its two hour duration and that just isn't the case; whether or not you'reinterested in politics or the history surrounding the events of the film will play or big role in your enjoyment of the film itself. \\"Argo\\" may be a good film that was just viewed by someone who isn't its target audience, but in the meantime just seems like another Ben Affleck related project that's being over praised because of who's attached to it and its bureaucratic subject matter.interested in politics or the history surrounding the events of the film will play or big role in your enjoyment of the film itself. \\"Argo\\" may be a good film that was just viewed by someone who isn't its target audience, but in the meantime just seems like another Ben Affleck related project that's being over praised because of who's attached to it and its bureaucratic subject matter.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the entire series. The Mockingjay was a good read in so far as to getting to the end of the series. Not as fiery and heart-stoppingly exciting as either the first two. But an enjoyable read and an ending one does not necessarily expect. I would go so far as to say i'd read all 3 books in quick succession again.
B008220CC4|4.0|Out of all the films labeled as horror to be released this year, not many (if any at all) have actually had bite to them or have offered authentic scared. As incredible as \\"The Cabin in the Woods\\" was, it was how the film messed with your head and it's completely epic mind-warping conclusion that made it so memorable. Most PG-13 fare like \\"The Woman in Black\\" or \\"House at the End of the Street\\" relied on nothing but jump out scares while R-rated horror like \\"Piranha 3DD\\" and \\"Chernobyl Diaries\\" are just poorly written all around and awful however you try to look at them.<br /><br />Thankfully \\"Sinister\\" can be categorized with your favorites from throughout the year. One of the ways it's able to accomplish that is how it utilizes sound in addition to its visuals to attempt to creep you out. The more senses a horror film is able to play with and manipulate properly to put you that much closer to the edge of your seat, the better that particular film turns out to be. What you hear in \\"Sinister\\" and the way those sounds seem like they're coming from all around you makes the events that unfold throughout the film all the more terrifying.<br /><br />Such heavy use of sound effects actually contributes to the film's incredibly glowing reputation. The encompassing creaks of the house of the Oswalt family are almost overwhelming at times because you can never quite pinpoint where they're coming from and the score is just as paralyzing. The music is very unusual as it's typically a pulsating rhythm with a ton of bass, the sounds of super 8 film reaching the end of its track, or various sounds that appear to be out of tune and/or played backwards. These noises almost seem like they shouldn't be strung together to make the score of a film since they're just sounds and noise, but the score is successfully rattling and is really unnerving.<br /><br />The emphasis on the super 8 projector and home movies comes off very well. Seeing Ellison (Ethan Hawke) prepare each film or seeing the horrors he witnesses in the darkness of his office in the reflection of his glasses is grotesquely mesmerizing. \\"Sinister\\" finds a way to make the concept of playing a super 8 film compelling every time that projector is turned on. The use of dynamic perspectives, the close-ups of the lens of the camera or the on/off switch of the projector, and the scene where Ellison falls asleep on the couch with a bat in his lap as the sun rises are just a few examples of how glorious the cinematography is.<br /><br />Aside from the super 8 films, the menacing figure of Bughuul/Mr. Boogie that appears in each film has one of the most unique concepts to be put into a horror film of recent memory. Hearing his origins for yourself is part of the film's macabre charm, but just embrace the fact that there are still horror movies out there that are trying to do something different and original.<br /><br />The one thing that \\"Sinister\\" doesn't necessarily do wrong, but may not sit right with a lot of people is revolve so heavily around children. Their inclusion works perfectly, but their involvement feels overused and a bit silly by the time the film's conclusion rolls around. Whether you're a fan of evil children in horror to begin with may play a factor in that though. The problem with that is that getting rid of that aspect of the film would also rob you one of the defining moments of the film, so it's kind of a catch-22 situation.<br /><br />\\"Sinister\\" does for home movies what \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" did for nightmares. The combination of an extremely well-edited film along with a score that immediately puts the hairs on your arms on end and sound effects that make your spine tingle completely envelopes you in this cocoon of anxiety. Many horror films fall apart once their origins are explained, but \\"Sinister\\" only seems to flourish on the fact that its explanations only make the final product more frightening. With a magnificent performance from Ethan Hawke, \\"Sinister\\"provides the authentic scares the horror junkie in you has been craving all year long.provides the authentic scares the horror junkie in you has been craving all year long.
B008BM9L72|1.0|After much hype and peer pressure (in the form of oohing and aahing about the main characters) i succumbed and read this series and was sadly disappointed in all that it was and all that it had purported to be. I think years of reading the odd Mills & Boon (when there is nothing else interesting to read) has desensitised me to such liberal and hyperbolic exclamations of love and lust.... so all i can say is love it or hate it at your own peril! Because I honestly don't know what to say about it
B007M45PMU|5.0|The whole album is absolutely wonderful, there is not a bad song on it. I have alot of respect for this band, it seems that their mission is to share joy with their fans.  Such a good value for such an awesome album!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I REALLY REALLY enjoyed reading this book!  What a fun ride of emotions.  My only downside, was the ending left me feeling so unsatisfied.  I felt like I invested so much emotion into this story, that it felt unfinshed.  I guess that's life though... you don't always get the whole package tied up with a pretty little bow.<br /><br />I'd say, based on the book in it's entirety, I would definately recomend this book.  The ride was definately worth it.

0765316994|4.0|Damn you, John Scalzi, for making me giggle helplessly at death. A quick, fun read.<br /><br />-+-<br /><br />The title of John Scalzi's new novel, Redshirts', is as irresistible as the premise. For those not familiar with the term `redshirt' the first chapter serves as a quick introduction. On his first away mission, a young ensign is unprepared and overwhelmed. Trapped on a rock and surrounded by `landworms', he fires into the dirt, driving the voracious predators into a frenzy and then decides to make a break for it. He is devoured before he reaches the tunnel entrance, of course. The captain utters a few words of commiseration but the reader gets the sense the situation is all too familiar. The loss of a low-ranked crew member, new and untried, barely mars the mission. A redshirt ensign is expendable.<br /><br />In fact, every away mission led by certain crew members ends in disaster...for someone else. The captain always survives, as does his chief science officer. Lieutenant Kerensky is less fortunate, he is often injured. He always recovers, however. Any accompanying ensign is at risk and even the superstitions cobbled together by the terrified crew of the Universal Union Capitol Ship `Intrepid' don't always prove true. The death of one ensign does not necessarily provide protection for the others and the greenest crew member doesn't always count as a reliable sacrifice.<br /><br />A handful of new ensigns quickly pick up the fact something is amiss. The crew scatter when the captain approaches or an away mission is planned; closets suddenly need reorganising. When picked for a mission, they bid tearful goodbyes to friends and then bicker amongst themselves over laws of averages and then they die. The new ensigns, led by Andy Dahl - whom the captain repeatedly calls `dill' - hunt for answers.<br /><br />In Science Fiction, all is rarely as it seems. In `Redshirts', it's really twisted. The loss of low-ranked crew members is not entirely due to incompetence, nor is it merely coincidence. Some other factor is in play and once it is proposed, it makes a horrible kind of sense. Even the crew members who chose not to believe the explanation find it difficult not to be affected by it the very idea of it. I don't want to ruin the surprise in my review, however, so I'll leave it to the reader to discover just what is happening on board the Intrepid.<br /><br />John Scalzi writes funny books. `Agent To The Stars' is one of my favourites and I can remember laughing so much I was asked to read in another room. `Redshirts' is written in a similar style. Despite the body count, I giggled my way through it, soft chuckles turning to outright laughter at one particularly senseless death. Yes, I laughed when someone died. I felt bad; I liked the character and had hoped he'd make it through to the end. The novel is a quick read, I finished it in about three hours and thoroughly enjoyed myself, even though I was not as entertained by the Codas at the end of the book.<br /><br />Scalzi's wit and humour works as well in his more serious novels, but reading `Redshirts' felt a bit like taking a well deserved holiday. It's a great book, one I'll re-read and recommend to others.<br /><br />Written for and originally published at SFCrowsnest.or is it merely coincidence.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Omfg just beuatiful wordinv and amazing action, like the hjnger gsmes actually happened.<br /><br />Love thisb book. must read for newbies!
0316228532|1.0|I found Casual Vacancy an overwhelming disappointment.  Too many characters, such sad teens..two of whom remind me of the Columbine shooters, although they did not mount a mass attack...Each of the characters is well-sketched, but I hit compassion fatigue pretty early.  It's a sort of Lord of the Flies meets HArper Valley PTA in an English village.  Rowling is still a wordsmith, manages complex plotting deftly, and can capture nuance perfectly.  But worth reading?  Oh no.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|The characters have real emotions and reflect what you would feel should you be put into the same situations. I love reading a character like Katniss who feels like she exists. All 3 books are great.
0316228532|1.0|I've read and re-read the Potter series, so I couldn't wait for Ms. Rowling's first \\"grown-up\\" book.  Maybe if I'd had lower expectations, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. The book had no redeeming characters, the pace was plodding, and I found it hard to finish. If it had been written by anyone else, I would have abandoned it, but I kept thinking there might be a hopeful twist.  I'm not suggesting a Pollyanna all's-well-that-ends-well finish, but a nice mixture of positive and negative personalities would have been nice. I hope Ms. Rowling returns to the fantasy genre...there's no doubt she is gifted, so hopefully this is just a hiccup in her successful career.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book I do hope the author continues the story.  Its a must read for every women or man out there.
B00992CF6W|1.0|this app should be free because then people would get it so please make this game free please please please!!!!0
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Originally got this as a free app of the day. Worked flawlessly on my s3 but had to do a factory reset. Redownloaded the app and now it won't open on the same phone. Is there something wrong with the package? Please advise/fix.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am a bit of an anglophile but my husband agrees this is a really great series.  The characters are wonderful and the story is compelling.  Can't wait for season 3.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|For a fairly cheap product, this is definitely worth the price.  The screen protector is nothing to write home about and does not smooth out easily with lots of bubbles.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|The copy of Hunger Games was a used purchased. I found it to be in perfect condition. The movie is a bit upsetting in places, but well done overall.
0307454568|4.0|Okay, let's start with the first book.  In my opinion, Dragon took well over 200 pages to get going.  Once the mystery took hold, in my opinion, the final few hundred pages flew by.<br /><br />The second book, Fire, took about 175 pages to get going.  But that too had a finishing kick that was terrific.<br /><br />The final book, Hornet's Nest, started from the beginning and didn't stop.  I loved all 3 books.  But to me the real trick and great concept is what Larsson did with the main characters in the second and third books.<br /><br />****A little spoiler here, but nothing that ruins the stories.****  We all know the main characters for all 3 books are Salander and Blomkvist. Larsson did something remarkable in the second and third books that I've never read in any book with 2 main characters. Larsson was able to continue the story of these 2 throughout both books, but they don't talk to each other until the last page of either the 2nd or 3rd book!  Actually in both instances, it's the last paragraph!  Brilliant writing.  Incredible how he pulled this off.<br /><br />I'm not going to discuss the details of how women are treated in these books. I'd venture to say if any of you have read any sort of fictional mysteries or so-called true crime books, then you've no doubt have read a lot worse.  Suffice it to say one victim gets her revenge and you are very happy for her.  In Larsson's skilled description, the attacker gets what he deserves.<br /><br />I know there are lots of 1 & 2 star reviews for all 3 books, due in part to their length and probably, their pacing.  I can only say, in my opinion, these 3 books are great reads.  As I stated above, the first two move quite slowly for a couple hundred pages.  But please give these a chance.  In my opinion, once you finish the first, you'll want to get thru all 3 as quickly as possible.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I was very pleased with this season, it was everything I was expecting.  Each season seems to get better and better
B006LSZECO|5.0|God I loved this book! I can't wait for the author to write another book. I have read all three she has written so far.
0345803485|1.0|I was disappointed overall with the age of the characters, lack of real or fantasy, if you wish, situations, and the lack of a better story line.  There's nothing exciting about the story; even the so called sex acts were lacking & boring for me.  I bought it because of all the hype, but would not recommend it for mature adults.  I see why folks gave it the bad ratings they did.  Do yourself a favor and borrow it from the library if you are curious.  If you have never read bdsm books, then you might like it because it's your 1st;  if you're more experienced, you probably won't like it.  I won't bother reading the sequels no matter how great a rating they get.  I recommend this book to the young & very inexperienced bdsm wannabees,,,sorry!  :)
B000JMKTLO|5.0|God I loved this book! I can't wait for the author to write another book. I have read all three she has written so far. She never disappoints.

0525423656|5.0|I liked the first book and was interested in what would happen next but wasn't blown away by it. The second book was awesome. Beautifully written, captivating, stayed up much too late reading it. Now I can't wait for the third, and think they should make a movie out of this series.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Judi Dench, Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith offer an outstanding performance as usual. Dev Patel and other offer equally fine performances. A quirky movie with an expected positive ending. It will not dissapoint you. It will not awe you either.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|this is a video that leaves you wanting more ....it is so heartwarming and the footage at the endof the video is absolutely great......I would recomend this to everyone who is tired of the usual bangup and vulgar stuff that is being thrown on us these days.......<br />Amazon is such a reliable source for anythig I purchase
B000SGSU58|5.0|This was a great read from start to finish.  This story kept me guessing up until the very end.  I am very excited to read the next in the series.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|And the crows eat well....because this book was almost dead for me.<br /><br />As this fourth entry to the Song of Fire and Ice series begins I immediately like it more than its predecessor.  We are taken through some life changing actions for some of the familiar characters while being introduced to still more.  This is definitely a series that needs to be read in order to get the full scope of this epic dramatic fantasy.  However while just desserts are served here I found myself missing my favorite characters a lot. That \\"miss-age\\" is possibly one of the reasons the book seemed to drag for me and led me to the sin of skimming in places.  It also strong resembled a newer foundation being laid over the old one to continue with the series.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am losing my fascination with this series, a feeling I didn't think I'd ever have when I started out but am becoming increasingly uncertain if I can drum up any interest in the meanderings with so many new characters.
B005LAIHSG|1.0|The movie was okay but they didn't finish the story. It was just a big let down at the end.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love love love this workout DVD!!! I tend to be very lazy when it comes to exercising and it's usually really tough to 1. even get me up to workout and 2. for me to actually stick with it and do it more than just a week or so.  The best thing about this workout is that it's only 20 minutes! And it kicks your butt, by the end I am covered in sweat and really feeling it in my muscles, I have been able to stick with this for about a month now!  I really like that there is 3 different levels which helps if you start to get tired of some of the moves but I'm still doing level one and it kicks my ass every time.  The moves are also nice and simple to understand and easy to follow.  One of Jillian's assistants also shows how to do modified versions of all the moves as well which is helpful. I've been recommending this dvd to everyone!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I was highly anticipating the completition of the 50 shades triology but the author let me know. strange twists but could have been better

B009O8IMUY|4.0|This is good TV. It's not the best show ever, but it does a good job of having main characters that are realistic enough for you to care about with secondary characters that are zany, sexy and funny enough to keep you laughing and well entertained.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a very good book i would recommend it for anyone to read. once i started reading i couldn't put it down
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I personally loved the book and will read it again so give it 5 stars. I also understand why some people didn't like it and I think it depends what you want out of a book. I don't have much time to read (have maybe read 20 books in 5 years) so when I do get a chance to read it doesn't have to be the best book ever written, just a storyline i enjoy with a 'cant put book down' feeling. The types of books I've read and felt this about seem to have the theme of people who have a soulmate type of love but there are factors that keep them apart (twilight series, the bronze horseman series). That style isn't for everyone and if it's not for you, then don't buy this book! I personally loved the series and have recommended to others - but have been selective about those who I've recommended to. Yes there are repetitive words and yes there are some cheesy bits to it, like how many billionaires are there at 27 who are so hot etc... but it's fantasy and I like a bit of escapism in my life every now and then. Hope this helps someone!
0316228532|1.0|The book was well-written as far as the style, characters, descriptions, etc, but so depressing and just tawdry and pointless.  It's as if JKR can only allow \\"magic\\" people to be good.  The parent-child relationships make me wonder if she has huge issues with her parents.  It's hard to believe a town this small would have quite that many horrible people, horrible parents and horrible kids.  I enjoyed the HP books, have read lots of contemporary British adult fiction and was curious about what Rowling would produce. I struggled through to the end of the book, but was very glad to be finished with it.

What finally made me sorry to have read it were the grotesque scenes near the end which were more horrific than haunting.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|This is the worst book I've read this year.  Mr. Child's, it is apparent you couldn't come up with a good storyline.  The first half of the book was boring and disjointed.  This is the first time I have not completed one of Mr. Child's books.  I can't believe when you sold the rights to make a movie of Jack Reacher, you would agree, approve, or whatever, that Tom Cruise portray Jack.  I saw the trailer and I just laughed.  Here was Cruise standing in the middle of a circle, surrounded by men 4-5 inches taller and heavier and he is going to beat the tar out of them?  Give me a break!

B0037VNX44|5.0|I often cringe when people toss around the phrase \\"tour de force performance\\" but rarely have I seen an actor's eyes, mannerisms, and body language so engaged in the action. The story itself doesn't have that many facets, but it has energetic random over the top but entirely believable acting and surreal but never distracting cinematography.  Bronson is like an animal that could never be tamed and a rambunctious spirit that could never be broken.  It shares themes with \\"Clockwork Orange\\" but never it's style or content.

B008220AVW|3.0|You may ask \\"What's so different about this movement than Beatlemania, Glam rock of 1972, or the New Romantic British Synthpop of 1982?\\"  It's all centered around one person, whose lyrics have very little depth, randomness, or awareness of the complex world.  I admit some of her melodies are catchy, but they're all spoiled by a vocal or drum that pierces the other sounds.  Not since Michael Jackson's death has such an unhealthy all consuming lifestyle been built around a celebrity.
0307474259|5.0|This book is well written and hits the nail on the head as to why exactly we get fat and what we have to do to reverse it. By following Gary's recommendations of cutting out starches and sugars I have dropped 20 pounds in almost 1 month without being hungry and with little to no cravings. I have also not exercised a single day either.<br /><br />I should make a note that I fall into the category of people who are so sensitive to sugar and starches that even a little bit in the form of green vegetables and berries hinders my weight loss. I know this for a fact because after losing significant amount of weight after 2 weeks of zero carb, I spent my 3rd week consuming significant amounts of green vegetables and moderate amount of berries. I didn't lose a single pound that entire week. On the 4th week I cut out all the carbs again and the weight began melting off once again.<br /><br />I plan to continue following a zero carb regimen until I am at my ideal weight and then stick to regular low carb for the long haul. I finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. Being overweight will soon be a thing of the past.<br /><br />10/25/13 update:<br /><br />I guess it was all too good to be true. I had dropped from 235 to 194 in about 4 months and then have now regained almost all the weight back and now at 233. Low carb diets are simply just not sustainable long term for most people.

0984183523|5.0|Case Interview Secrets is best used as a foundation for those who learn by doing. The book provides three main things:<br /><br />1. A structured way to think about consulting interviews; it does not provide numerous lists to memorize<br />2. Powerful yet flexible case frameworks that are easy to understand as well as apply<br />3. Soft-skills review, which are occasionally glossed over in other publications<br /><br />It is critical to note that this book is not a case prep package. The publication is case-light (there is one worked example) because of the countless variations that could appear in an interview. To \\"overcome\\" this candidates are strongly encouraged to practice the tool kit in live situations (learning by doing), which is essential regardless of the preparation text used.<br /><br />A great start point for succeeding in case interviews!

B004LWZWGA|1.0|This entry in the impressive Batman saga is one holy piece of crap.  It started off with a series of events that made me ask, \\"what the **** does this have to do with Gotham City?\\" then I suffered through the rest of it, thinking (about an hour later) when is this going to be over?  Believe me, not for <way> too long a time.<br /><br />This movie has no story, it's characters have no heart, it has no sensible back story, it's just one explosion after another, one betrayal after another, with nothing that makes any sense to hold it together.  It's as if the original story conference went something like \\"first of all, we need an evil villain - let's make him wear a mask like Darth Vader, then nobody could miss the fact that he's EVIL.  And we need lots of explosions - let's make him blow up ALL of Gotham City.  Why?  Who cares?  Nobody who sees the movie will care, so why should be bother to come up with a reason?\\"<br /><br />The whole movie is like this.  People do things for no reason, things are blown up for no reason, and as far as I can tell the whole movie exists for no reason.  Oh yeah - it made lots of money.<br /><br />It's just about THE WORST movie I've ever seen.  Well, maybe Madagascar 3 is worse.  But not by much.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Today is 10/12/2012 friday and I listened to Clockwork Angels yesterday and already I picked out my favorite tunes.  Snakes and Arrows is where I left off and this is just magic music.  When you grow up with a band what can I say???? even cd's you don't like that much it's still your band.  Caravan BU2B Halo Effect 7 Cities of Gold Headlong Flight Wish Them Well The Garden (the rest too but you get the point) I'm glad everyon's still alive to make music and I'll enjoy them till I'm dead(which I hope aint no time soon)
B0058YPILY|5.0|Great. Great season. Great special features. Esp. the wedding toasts & \\"Wheels Up\\" video. Hilarious! Always highly recommend watching all special features!
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|I'm listening to the cd as I write this review and I'm loving it.  I've got lots of vai and the story of light is more good stuff.  His slow stuff is really great like creamsicle sunset and mullach a' tsi(which is really beautiful) john the revelator is just plain neat(neat?????) yes I said neat! Gravity Storm Weeping China Doll nice guitar sound on both so to sum this up an A plus I give it
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This game is fun but not to easy it needs to get a life. You know what I mean right.JK its a fun game fun to play and mess around with good game from 1-10 I would give it a 9 ok pretty good game right
B000SEIK2S|5.0|it was fun, it really was. some of the dialogue was stilted, some of the action sequences were a bit hard to follow. there were very few 'new ideas', many of the tropes seem borrowed from other works. this last bit is forgivable, much as in science, in science fiction we stand upon the shoulders of giants.<br /><br />that said, i truly enjoyed reading the book, and i appreciated that the author didn't mind killing people. a good read!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This album is excellent.  It took me a few listens to really appreciate it, but there is not a single track that I skip or don't like.  It is an excellent follow up to Sigh No More.  Brilliant sophomore effort from an amazing band.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was very good for kids.I would so recommend tjis book for you!!but the first book was better it had more action
B002U3CCBK|4.0|Perhaps it's a pity I saw the film before I read the book. The screenwriter did a good job in changing the character of the spin doctor from male to female, and in providing a more resolute, although perhaps softer, ending that seemed to fit the whole 'message' of the book better. Because of this I found the ending of the book unsatisfactory.<br />But the book itself is very good. The concept of using emails, and letters and memos and diary entries to propel the narrative was clever and worked well: although at times I found the diary entries a little boring. But then again how do you show a boring character except by being boring?<br />The characters are well drawn, and in particular, having lived and worked in The Gulf, the Sheik was a very accurate portrayal of a good Muslim with his simple faith and belief - his totally unironic view of life - something that The West simply do not get. As it says in the book their faith and prayers are as natural as breathing and eating, and \\"faith comes before hope, and hope comes before love\\" which is, I think, the book's message.<br />Also, having visited Aberdeen many times (although I preferred the wonderful golf to salmon fishing) and stayed in a converted granite hunting lodge very like the Sheik's estate, I found that section of the book accurate and enjoyable in showing the quality of life there.<br />Overall I enjoyed the book. It is entertaining, with an accurrate and believable context with  some passages of very good insightful writing. What a pity about the ending.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Here, we have a housekeeper who reassures Ana that Christian Grey is \\"a good man\\".  The very same housekeeper that has a set of keys to the Red Room of Pain, where her duties include cleaning butt-plugs and scrubbing female flesh from handcuffs and floggers.  Her moral compass may be somewhat askew.<br /><br />If you have always dreamed of a man who will not only take out the trash but remove your tampon without rolling his eyes, this is the perfect book by which to measure your current or future love.

B005LAIHSQ|1.0|I could not watch the movies because they are in the Blue Ray format. They were advertised by Amazon as DVD and Digital but would not operate on my system. The advertisement was misleading and false. I gave them away.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was suggested to me because I read the 50 Shades trilogy. As I read this book, I was preparing myself for a book with a BDSM theme. They are not my favorite type of book. So thankfully Bared to You was not a physical BDSM book. What it is is a book where the main characters have had a history of sexual trauma and their struggle to be together and make it work.<br />But there is almost a sick need between the main characters. It can be tough to understand as the story is told from Eva's POV. I had a few times where I just couldn't understand how Eva could continuously lay herself open for Gideon. But that's why there is a sequel.<br />The sex in this story is HOT and almost unbelievable in it's intensity. It might be difficult in parts for people who have had a history of sexual abuse to read. The story ends in such a way that you have to read the sequel because you know there is more to their story.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I loved it. A very open bio of AK's life so far. He isn't afraid to talk about the many issues he has faced and is dealing with.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This is the sequel to Bared to You. I will not give away any spoilers, that's no fun!<br />In this book we finally learn what happened to Gideon as a child. But it doesn't happen until the very end. It was another book with hot sex scenes and emotional scars. You learn a little more about the secondary characters and how they support the main characters. I did feel that Eva's inability to function without Gideon was a bit overdone. It is almost unnatural, their obsession with each other. But I feel that might be what the author is intending to convey.<br />Everything was tied up a little too quickly in the end. But that just makes it so that you have to read the next one that comes out in a few months.<br />All in all, a good erotic romance with intense emotions tying it all together.

B008G8SFGO|4.0|For just once in a KISS album review would I not like to read about how it does or does not compare to another album.  Take it for what it is.  Is it KISS' greatest album ever - no. Is it their worst album ever - no.  But it's a good, solid rockin' effort from KISS 2012.  It took them eleven years after Psycho Circus to release Sonic Boom and then another three to release Monster.  During that time all KISS fans were saying was how they wanted new music.  Then when they get it, half of them complain.  Nothing KISS releases will ever live up to the hype or expectations of KISS fans.  No song will ever be Detroit Rock City or Love Gun.  How could it be?  We've been listening to those great songs for over thirty years.  They've reached a status that can't be touched!  Even if something was ever better than Destroyer there's no way that we as fans could see it or admit it.  Each and every album that they have released has been different and unique in its own way.  An album is where the band is now - not in the past or even the future.  Be glad that we still have a KISS to enjoy and new music to listen to.  It seems that most rock bands either don't even bother releasing new material or very rarely do it (except Alice Cooper.) KISS is one of those bands that you will be able to tell your grandchildren that you saw - just like Elvis or the Beatles. And on another note that I'm tired of reading about concerning the original members:  Here's a fact for you.  Ace Frehley did the last shows of \\"The Farewell Tour\\" with Eric Singer in Peter's make-up.  Peter Criss did Symphony and \\"The World Domination Tour\\" with Tommy Thayer in Ace's make-up.  And neither one had a freakin' problem with it until they weren't in the band making money themselves.  I hate this psycho babble about Ace and Peter.  I love the two, but come on.  Only after they were booted did they start to complain that it was wrong for KISS to go on and for others to wear their make-up.  Heck, in the beginning, Aceeven gave his blessing to Tommy saying that he wouldn't want anyone else but Tommy to wear it.  That's the truth, but no one ever says it or remembers it.  All they want to do is complain and say that KISS isn't KISS without Ace and Peter.

B001AQR3E4|4.0|one of my fav vampire movies of all time!! i found this for $8 on Blu-ray and decided to get it and replace the DVD counterpart. first off Warner Bros did an excellent job with the HD transfer (as they always do) the film isn't nearly as grainy as the DVD is but here is where WB failed which is with the audio. the DVD counterpart offers both English Dolby Digital 5.1 & DTS 5.1 audio tracks however, with the Blu-ray for some reason all you get is a standard English Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. no DTS-HD or even a Dolby TrueHD audio track. why did they not take advantage of Blu-ray's full potential with this film? if you already own the DVD counterpart and are considering replacing it with Blu-ray you'll have to ask yourself \\"do i wanna give up having a DTS audio track in favor of HD video, or just deal with having video quality that is slightly grainier in favor of having a higher quality audio?\\" the choice is really up you in the end
B004NOH9LC|5.0|it makes me cry and laugh at the same time.the cast was great and I really enjoyed it. I will never be tired to watch.
B007TK77QE|1.0|HP was a derivative pastiche, spawning Twilight and company, and if you think about it, HP was filled with a good deal of quasi-sadistic violence, directed at children. Little wonder then that her first adult effort was adult in every sense of the word but one: there is no depth. Overall, the vacancy in this ponderous and pretentious book is anything but casual and confirms the suspicions of many, if many other reviews are an indication of public opinion: a lackluster book from a less than mediocre &#34;author&#34;- there are better books in the world, and I hope that readers will continue to appreciate substance over tripe and hype.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|If Jim Croce and Donovan had a baby together and raised the kid on Bob Dylan and Nick Drake while living in the inner city, you might end up with another Rodriguez.  He is a missed talent the likes of Alex Chilton.  I listen to his music and I am dumbfounded that the record industry allowed to him to slip away.  His music is right there with anybody of his era.  This disc is a lost treasure and all music lovers should own it.  Just get it.  You won't regret it.  Five very big stars.
B004NSURT4|5.0|entertaining yet complex- a wonderful read. It is refreshing to spend time in the company of an author who is skilled at both subtlety and suspense.
1594484805|1.0|I cringed at many of the business suggestions the author provides in this book. Removing all sales commissions is NOT a way to grow a sales force. Giving unlimited vacation days is a BAD way to let your HR go into chaos. My favorite suggestion is that managers give our employees 20% of their time to do as we please.<br /><br />ALL of his examples point to software development. I must say that withou knowing the author it is apparent that he is definitely nota business man and is strictly an academic.<br /><br />The positives that come from this book is reviewing a more modern approach to maslows hierarchy.
B00846REIS|5.0|I would recommend this read to anyone.I couldn't wait for the second book to come out and now am dying for the third to come out as well.I read book one in 1 day.I read book 2 in 1 day.They are fairly lengthy books but I just couldn't put them down.

B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was a very interesting & quick reading book. It was full of suspense. It was easy to want to keep reading as there was so much activity going on in the story. I did not figure this out until the very end and his is how I like to read. Suspense till the very end. I plan to read more books by Blake Crouch.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm so glad that after months of waiting I wasn't disappointed, this book has the passion of the first, but finally you understand Gideon's pain and what lengths he will go to protect Eva! BRAVO Sylvia Day BRAVO!!!

Then, Amazon emailed me that from their end, the quality of my streaming video wasn't acceptable to them so they were refunding my money. That'll make me much less afraid to rent another movie in this format.  Maybe tonight.

159562015X|5.0|This is very valuable.  It gives everyone a head start in learning to work together.  I take the results of everyones test, put them into a spreadsheet and distribute it to the whole team so we can all see each others strengths.  It helps me as a leader, when I ponder on projects or client needs.  I constantly use the information gained here - to make business decisions!  I also had my teenagers take the online version for kids and it's helped me make better discipline and educaitonal decisions for my family.  I also use this as a giveaway when I do seminars or lectures - fun topic and original door prize!  WELL worth the price!!!

1469984202|4.0|With almost 2000 reviews at the time of this writing, there is no need for me to be anything but brief with these comments. I like to support these \\"underground\\" (pun intended) books, however, so I feel this work and author deserve my review. First off, I think Hugh Howey has one of the most imaginative minds going right now. The overall concept of this story (which is still continuing) is fascinating, and the themes introduced take this beyond normal \\"science fiction\\". There are several primary characters featured throughout the five books of the Omnibus edition, but Howey does a great job giving them all a unique voice and story. My only criticism is that the ending to the fifth book felt very rushed. After pages of build up, the ending sort of just happened and then that was the end. There did not appear to be a climax to the story, with everything just \\"working out\\". I understand that this isn't the end of the overall series, but prior to the fifth book, each story seemed to have a natural conclusion. The fifth, however, made me feel like I had skipped over several pages, as if the author saw the finish line and dashed for it rather than continuing the pace set previously. Not a huge deal, since I still really enjoyed the book, but I wanted a little more. I look forward to the rest of the volumes, though.

I learned about David Garrett from a PBS special then researched it on Amazon.  Of course, they provided access to purchase all of his recordings.  Thanks Amazon!!!

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire continues the entertaining, well-written and awfully disturbing Hunger Games series.  It is as entertaining and as ferocious as Book 1; however, it is clearly written to be something of a middle installment rather than a book that stands on its own.  Readers can expect to be entertained and drawn into the story, as they were with Hunger Games;  however, the conclusion is not satisfying or complete--it merely leads to the final book, so you might as well purchase Book 3, too.

B008GVD6D8|5.0|Book Review: Reflected In You<br /><br />People, let's make it clear this book is NOT Fifty Shades of Grey. Period. This is not for the faint hearted. You won't go away reading this starry eyed like a lovestucked puppy. It will leave you wanting, gripped and awestruck with how the writer told their story and how she made it her own.<br /><br />It is a story of consuming obsessive love of Eva and Gideon. Their story evolves in this passionate way of need of each other physically and emotionally. Dysfunctional you can call it and you will think that love like this does not exist. Scary as it is. But how can you be sure?<br /><br />A much more intense emotions had been shown by both protagonist which is understandable on their \\"trying to know stage\\" compared in the first book. In here, will show their insecurities, the difficilties of living with their past. Of course hot dominatig sex scene still included but but by far not the main focus of the story but of a delicious treat.<br /> The suspense will keep you on your toes and make your mind throw questions at you. Gave me such a thrill reading this roller coaster love obsessed hate relationship. It will be interesting to know what will happen to this dark consuming love story. Can't wait for the next book.<br /><br />\\"everybody's got a dark side do you love me? can you love mine?<br />nobody's a picture perfect but we're worth it you know that we're worth it will you love me? even with my dark side?\\"- Darkside by Kelly Clarkson
B007N85ZXY|3.0|This album is a collection of Neil Young and Crazy Horse's electric rock interpretations of old folk songs.  I've heard a lot people talk about this album and describe the idea as \\"weird\\"(as if that's a bad thing), but I found myself intrigued.  I thought it was a really interesting idea.  And I really liked it at first.  The songs hit you with that big, dirty, heavy rock sound that these guys are so good at.  Wayfarin' Stranger is especially good.  That song is dark, brooding, and just plain beautiful.<br /><br />But sadly, the idea wears out its welcome.  For one thing, the songs sound too similar.  I'm a person that likes variety, and there's not much to be heard here.  Also, all the songs on this album are longer than they really need to be, and the album itself seems to drag on forever.  Some might read that and think, \\"Oh, so they're really jamming on this record.\\"  I wish that were the case.  Neil is playing his lead guitar, but he never rips it up like he does on Everybody Knows This is Nowhere.  Instead, they play some big riffs and chant the choruses over and over and over again.  Neil tells poor Tom Dooley to hang his head and cry about 87 times.  I'm sorry, but I just can't see any reason for that song to be eight minutes long.  I feel like Neil is saying, \\"Come on, sing along!\\" but something about these songs make me say, \\"No, I don't want to.\\"<br /><br />Now taken individually, all these songs are pretty good, but they just don't work as an album.  There's too much filler and not enough imagination.  There's nothing hugely inspiring or life-changing here.  What you have is a pretty decent rock album that doesn't know when to stop.  If you're a HUGE Neil Young fan, you might find it worth listening to.  If you're not, then I'd just move along.  You might check out some of these songs on youtube, but I wouldn't sit through the whole album.  Ah well, I know they're releasing another one later this year, and something tells me they'll really tear it up onthat one.

You can tell LEGO really payed attention to details. For hardcore LEGO fans you should know you only get three extra pieces. So don't lose your pieces! Also I would like to note. THERE\\"S NO STICKERS!!!! YAY! Because we all know, we hate those things... This thing is very fun to play with and also pretty durable. But the one thing that was disappointing was the play features. You can open the cockpit and there are flick fire missiles. Really LEGO? Again? Since there was no other play features they could have included a firing mechanism, or something! Anyways I got this for 35 bucks. I would wait to buy it until the price goes down.
0316228532|4.0|This is probably the best Maeve Binchy novel since Circle of Friends......wait, what?  It's Jo Rowling?  Oh right.  You sure?<br /><br />But seriously, this is an R-rated Maeve Binchy novel, only without a main protagonist or any truly likeable characters.  So of course I was riveted, go figure.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy's reason for being is the death of Barry Fairbrother, local councillor in the town of Pagford and basic nice guy who cared about people.  We see him briefly, and he sticks around long enough to make a good impression, making his 'end' a bit shocking (I purposefully knew nothing about the plot before opening the book).  His death creates a 'casual vacancy', meaning that his seat needs to be filled.  At stake, potentially, is the lease of the local drug clinic, and the boundary relocation of the local 'hard neighborhood'/slum The Fields.  Not national news of course, but the local folk take it extremely seriously.<br /><br />We meet the three candidates:  Miles Mollison, son of the council chair and presumed front-runner......Simon Price, aloof loner and abusive husband/father.....Cubby Wall, school deputy headmaster and friend of Barry's.  They aren't the main characters though, no one is really, and there must be at least a dozen other POV characters throughout the book.  Two teenagers are slightly moved more to the front than the others:  Andrew Price, shy and intimidated by his overbearing father Simon, but who winds up in a lot of scenes that should have nothing to do with him.  He has a basic decency about him, though he finds it difficult to let it show.  The other is Krystal Weedon, a 16 year old denizen of The Fields who smokes hard, talks and fights even harder, and only really cares about her 3 year old brother Robbie, and wants him better raised than she was (by her smack addicted mother, the worst piece of work in a novel full of them).  I got the feeling early on that Krystal is Jo's favorite of the bunch, and like Andrew she figuredin a lot of plotlines that otherwise you wouldn't expect.<br /><br />What did I like about it?  I'm a bit ashamed to say that I enjoyed the vileness of the characters, they kept me entertained as I wondered what they would do next, it would invariably be something bad to one of the others.  I read the novel during breaks at work, and I found myself, when I should have been concentrating fully on work, wondering what these people would be up to next.  The election was nicely done, and thankfully not over dwelled upon.  The story moved along, and I wouldn't have minded an extra 200 pages in it, not one bit.<br /><br />What's not to like?  Well the vileness frankly.  I could barely root for Andrew, and he was the nicest of the men, none of whom come off that well.  The women were done a little nicer (not better, nicer), but there was always one huge quality in each of them that made you want to scream at them.  Also, while I get why Jo liked Krystal.....well I didn't, and she was so obtuse about things, or willfully stubborn in a bad way, that I didn't mind when bad things happened to her as much as some of the other characters.<br /><br />There's not going to be a sequel to this novel, the reviews are shredding it just hard enough to guarantee that I think, but seeds are laid that allow Jo to revisit these characters if she wants to.  I kind of hope she does too.  I wouldn't want to read this kind of novel every week, I'd want to start cutting myself like one of the characters does, but she did it very well.  Of course it's not as good as Harry Potter was, though that wasn't a given, but nobody really expected it to be.  I just hope that whatever she does next, it won't take five years for her to do it.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved Bared to you but felt it was a little too much like 50 Shades...Reflected in You is nothing like that series. I loved it. I loved that both Eva and Gideon are so messed up that you think the two of them will never make it. I love the raw, insane sex they have and I love the way Sylvia writes. I cannot wait until the third and hope that it is every bit as good as the second one. Ahhh I still have goosebumps after just finishing this book. I love it when that happens!
B0098VXBIA|1.0|Sadly with such a stellar line up the movie bombed pretty badly. Even Elizabeth Banks was a disappointment. Small funny parts here and there but the trailer contains most of the comedy in the entire movie.
0345803485|5.0|Everyone told me the book was terrible. But after reading it I fell into the trap of reading the rest of the trilogy it's so good. And those people clearly don't know what there talking about, and they've never read the books. Always try something once. Ana tried and look what happens to her in the future books.
1449410243|5.0|So I just got my book today, and not to repeat other reviews but come on, rate the product for what it is, not due to your lack of understanding!<br /><br />So first, since I ordered the print version, I've gotta say the thing that most concerned me before ordering was the quality of the printing. This is a very cheap book, as in price-wise, it's on the low end particuarly for a high-color book, and I feared the print quality would suffer as a result. However, I've gotta say, the print quality is phenomenal. Nice thick glossy pages (but not so thick that the entire book is like 10 pages), spot-on high quality color printing, it just feels nice.<br /><br />The comics are also hilarious, but as other reviewers have commented, much of it is already on the 'net. That being said, I wasn't really shocked and personally, I don't think that's all that much of a problem. Many books merely gather web content, and many of them don't even provide new content as well! I have a post-secret book, which even though it's all online, seeing it in print is worth the price (if you like that kind of stuff). Heck, many comic series are free (Hobbes, Garfield, etc) yet I still buy those books as well. Anyways, the gist of it is yes, much of the book is already online, but some of it is not; if you absolutely love the Oatmeal comics the new ones are worth it, if you're kinda &#34;meh&#34; on the ones that area already online such as &#34;How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You&#34;, then no, the new content isn't worth it. Funny, but not pee your pants hilarious.<br /><br />Finally, This leads me to my one complaint, but again, I'd say it's also personal opinion: I wish the book was larger. While I can see and appreciate how neatly Inman organized the comics to work in a normal novel-size book, I think comics lend themselves to more &#34;creative&#34; book sizes, particularly when they are somewhat conversation-piece oriented. Personally, I actually would have liked a 10&#34;x14&#34; hardbound version, but I think Matthew did this probably to make the piece more affordable. Like I said, that's personal opinion, but I'm not going to knock off stars because Matthew didn't personally make and design the book to my exact specifications. The book is solid, and more then worth the price of admission.ink Matthew did this probably to make the piece more affordable. Like I said, that's personal opinion, but I'm not going to knock off stars because Matthew didn't personally make and design the book to my exact specifications.

B006JSXYPA|4.0|I enjoyed watching this on 3D TV. The special effects are awesome. I like the bluray copy for 2D viewing on large screen projection as well. Wish 3D version was available for the first Transformers movie.

B005EGXTHG|4.0|I loved the first book in the series, second i didnt find as engaging but still worth the read. Wanted alittle more from the characters.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I loved the first book.<br />I loved how strong Eva was, it was part of the reason I preferred her to Anastasia Steele from 50 Shades. But the author lost that this time around.<br />Eva was weak; often times I wanted to just stop reading when her and Gideon went around in circles. Gideon was pretty awful too, what he would say or his actions and he was really absent during this book. There isn't too much of the two of them together.<br />Also, the author spends way too much time reintroducing everything again! You shouldn't read this book if you haven't read the first, and we don't need a recap of every single person and who they are again.<br /><br />The first 100 pages were unbearable. I'm surprised I made it through. The latter half of the book does get slightly better, but overall it was pretty terrible. I highly doubt I'll purchase the 3rd.<br /><br />This book could have been great, but it fell so short.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|Just started using this product. Works great and a good price. Streaming online video came through great with the built in graphics.

B007NWPD14|1.0|If there was a Zero Stars option I would give it. I only managed to watch the first 30 minutes, but I would like my 30 minutes back along with my money.... Life is too short for this movie. I started watching it thinking well it can't be worse than the last DVD I bought - Silent Running (I am still recovering from that one). Actually it was. Both belong in the bin......<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and don't buy this movie. Smack your head into a wall repeatedly, or go to the dentist, it will be more enjoyable.<br />HK
1455502758|5.0|Without Mr. Hitchens ability to speak or write, he felt empty. The esophageal cancer eventually took away his ability to rhapsodize to his admirers and detractors, but left the curmudgeon his funny, acerbic and always illuminating pen. In this short memoir about his diagnosis and certain death to come, Mr. Hitchens refused to go gently into that good night without a few good parting shots. The outspoken atheist covers such topics as religious zealots who are tickled pink that he has cancer; the illogical nature of prayers; hilarious cancer treatment advice; the joy of public speaking and basically how medical treatments as well as his rapidly deteriorating body sucked big time.<br /><br />Without question, Mr. Hitchens was one of the late Twentieth and early Twenty-first Century's great writers and speakers. Much like H.L. Mencken's work, I did not agree with some of his stances, but I was always entertained by his ability to write wonderful, playful, erudite lines. The afterword by his surviving wife, Carol Blue, was an added bonus. This little, 111-page compendium was a pure joy. Any guy that can have me smiling and burst out laughing about cancer couldn't have been all that bad.
B0075D64DC|1.0|I'd like to say that this is the worst movie ever made, but it isn't. \\"Dark Star\\" was, but this runs a close second.<br />I think that a child under 12 would maybe enjoy this movie? But maybe not, there are alot of smart kids out there. My only regret is that I watched it to the end..... I found the story line implausible and very boring, and the main character pretty dull..... I like sci-fi, but not like this.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The Hunger Games was a fine film with great loyalty to the book and the characters imagined by author Suzanne Collins. It's also enjoyable for those who haven't read the books. Very exciting film.
B00471JSR4|5.0|It is a great movie. I'm a fan of G.I joe. Being one ever since the 1980's. i'm glad they made a movie.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|If I could give it like 4.8 stars I would just because it seems like 5 stars should be the greatest film of all time which is kind of a hard award to give, but the movie was really awesome. I plan on watching it again soon.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|This movie was funny. i can't believe how funny it was. At first, i thought this would suck....but i was wrong!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Stand alone the movie was  great just from the stand point of having been a Marvel Comic reader as a kid but from the stand point of having further been  a New Marvel Movie fan I had been waiting for this movie since the first Iron Man movie where we saw our first clip of Nick Fury. Of course each ensuing movie Iron Man 2 , The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America, just added to the anticipation. So I say way to go to Stan Lee for giving our generations The Marvel Experience.<br /><br />My hat is off to Amazon.com for having such an easy to use Streaming application also.
B000063COX|4.0|Iron Maiden's debut album of the same name is one of the best first albums that I've heard from a heavy metal group. It's far from perfect, but is entertaining and filled with promise. Here, Iron Maiden fuses their punk rock roots with heavy metal and cranks out some very good songs. Songs such as PROWLER, RUNNING FREE and CHARLOTTE THE HARLOT bring the punk punch, and work very well. There are two very different and slower songs (REMEMBER TOMORROW and STRANGE WORLD) that showcase the group's talents and versatility, and are my favorites on this album. Above all, there's just something about this album and the mood it creates. I'm always in a good mood after listening to this album. Is it the vocals, the music, or both? Paul Di'Anno is no Bruce Dickinson, but I still like his vocals, which are ideal for this style of music (punk and heavy metal). This album is one of Maiden's best, and not to be ignored. 8/10
0345803485|1.0|I call these books the Trainwreck Trilogy, I just couldn't look away, and once seen, you just can't unsee it.  The writing was juvenile (like two pre-teen girls got together and said let's write a book or three), the sexual interaction was pedestrian at best, and the characters had less substance than a dried up piece of used bubble gum.  This is a truly sad piece of prose.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved, loved this book...am reading book 2 now!!!! Very good story and very creative reading!!!! Recommended by my daughter who watched the HBO series and she knows I love to read and she was right about this author!!!!

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It seems to me, that this book divides readers quite extremely. There are avast number of people who rate this as a 1 or 2 star book, while many others rate it a 5. I think it depends what you go into this expecting.<br /><br />I didn't have any concept for what type if book this was. I had heard it was a YA, mysterious and slightly creepy read, yet I found it to be anything but creepy.<br /><br />People have likened this book to x-men. I can see some similarities, sure. But are there any truly original books these days?<br /><br />The characters were likable, I felt like you slowly got to know them more throughout the story, much like building friendships in real life. The children's peculiarities were different and mostly well explained and explored.<br /><br />I like where the book left off.<br /><br />The photos at times added to the story and at others, just seemed placed there for convenience. They weren't really needed.<br /><br />Despite that, I did enjoy Miss Peregrine's! If you feel like delving into the Welsh countryside on a little backwards island, experiencing the lives if some peculiar children, give this book a go. You may be surprised at how much you enjoy it.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Like that I can search, etc. Took a star off because it's a bit awkward in its interface, but I can live with that. :)

B000N2HBSO|5.0|In Team of Rivals, author Doris Kearns Goodwin looks at Abraham Lincoln and the members of his cabinet. She looks at the beginnings of their political careers. Not only is Lincoln extensively profiled, with his origins as a country lawyer and a single-term congressman, but also some members of his cabinet. There is William Seward, a former governor and U.S. Senator, Salmon Chase, Edwin Stanton, among others. This culminates in the Presidential election of 1860. It was noted that Lincoln's nomination as the Republican nominee was far from a forgone conclusion. Seward was considered the favorite beforehand and even Chase seemed like a viable candidate. Of course, Lincoln would go on to win.<br /><br />When Lincoln was assembling his cabinet, he wanted people that opposed him and would also question him. That is why he chose former Whigs and Democrats, including Seward and Chase, to serve. Shortly after Lincoln is sworn-in as President, the Civil War would break out. The war would weigh heavily on Lincoln's shoulders and his cabinet. Several key moments are looked at during the course of the war such as frustrations with General George McClellan's inaction, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Gettysburg Address, among many others.<br /><br />Slavery was the big issue of the day and the book examines everyone's view on it. While Lincoln thought slavery was immoral, he wanted the war at first to be about saving the Union. Members of his cabinet were of a far more abolitionist viewpoint.<br /><br />In conclusion, I found this book to be an excellent look at Abraham Lincoln and his cabinet. I would highly recommend this to those interested in Abraham Lincoln, the American Civil War, or American history.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|ok so I thought this would be boring well its not!! Great fun and I get really excited to win those darn prizes! Love it when the big coin drops too! I seriously cannot not stop playing it! Get it and you wont regret it!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy having the Bible on my phone. This app makes it easy to read on the go. Definitely a must.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved it. great end to the series. didnt think i would enjoy these at all but i really did. yay!
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Great songs and great lyrics. I was an occasional P!nk listener and was drawn to the album by the fab \\"blow me (one last kiss)\\" single but after repeated listenings I'm now a true fan. Every song has a story to tell and the tunes are so catchy.<br />I truly recommend this even if you are not a P!nk fan.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This is a \\"grown-up\\" version of the Snow White fairy tale we have all heard many times before.  Dark and gritty, the queen exhibits pure evil, though you develop a little sympathy for her by the end (just as Snow White does).  The costumes and effects are great, and Hemsworth once again proves he is an action star to watch.  This isn't your children's fable, but definitely one older teens and adults can get into, particularly if you enjoy films of action and the fantasy/sci-fi genre.
B002RZZIXU|5.0|I enjoyed the mind games in this novel, between spy and mentor, woman and man, America and Britain, mother and daughter. The games of espionage, love affairs, allied forces and family happened in WWII as well as at the present. Ambition, selfishness, mistrust and betrayal led to conflicts between those who were supposed to be partners. To win those games, you have to think what your opponent thinks what you are thinking and then surprise him, rock-paper-scissors.<br /><br />This is the second book i read that is written William Boyd, after Waiting for Sunrise. I like both. Waiting for Sunrise feels darker and more literary; its characters more complex. Restless feels lighter, moves faster, more readable; its characters simpler, yet charming.

This the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. To top it off I have to pay for the return. Amazon sucks! I remain thoroughly disgusted, Vern Allred

B005LAIHY0|1.0|Firstly, I want to start off by admitting I am an Alien Fanboy, a fanboy of kittens and freakn proud of it.  Alien and Aliens still top my list as Sci-horror at its absolute best.  But these astute opinions and the fact i love kittens have nothing to do with my review, since I walked into this movie actually not wanting another Alien/s or another kitten for that matter, but wanting to explore the dark universe Alien resides in and even darker motivations of Weyland Corp.<br /><br />You see, in all the Alien movies that came before Prometheus, Weyland was always the hidden motivator, trying deftly to get their hands on what could be the next biological weapon to sell or what-have-you and would stop at nothing at deceptively trying to reach that goal; Ripley's kitten knew what was up boy, believe, cats are smart like that.  But with that and the constant threat of just how dangerous these creatures were (not kittens, but can be if irritated) made the first two movies so freaking awesome.  However, Weyland was never the prime focus of the movies, they were always secondary or an offshoot which helped create tension (a who's worse scenario, the creature or the corporation?) and thats fine, but ultimately this is why I just could not wait to see Prometheus.<br /><br />Now, turning to the kitten in the middle of the room, Prometheus or better yet, Ridley Scott, because in my mind, its not Prometheus's fault its bad, its the direction/editing/story thats at fault here.  Ridley that ol' kitten hasn't made a decent flick in years.  Movie studios keep handing him all the ingredients to make a delicious chocolate cake, but what we get looks good, but tastes like crass.  This saddens me since some of my favorites have come from this guy (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator to name a few).  But all storys must adhere to what is invariably called \\"The Formula\\" and without getting into too much detail, the term coin's a tried and true set of rules that are to be applied to create a successful story arch.  In this process, character or protagonist development takes place, motivations are layed out, stimulus is applied so that as the audience is viewing the movie can emotionally unite themselves with a particular character or overall campaign the movies story is attempting to tell...emersion...to which Prometheus attempts, but ultimately does neither, which I find inexcusable from a veteran director with a resume as long as my kittens tail.<br /><br />With that said, Prometheus as a story took \\"the formula\\", crumpled the process up into a ball and tossed it right into the garbage.  Sometimes this works, however, the rules still apply.  As I sat and watched the first half hour I was like \\"Ok cool, we're going to a distant planet to try and make contact with kittens\\" - queue a cornucopia of cool looking visuals - \\"we're there, and it looks awesome\\".  Next, we've landed and immediately want to go explore (something I'd do presented with cool new planet to explore, but I digress) awesome, jump right in...BUT WAIT!!!....WHO ARE THESE FREAKN PEOPLE IM SUPPOSED TO BE CARING ABOUT?!?  The movie jumped from one thing to another without taking a breather to flesh out your characters, maybe contemplate why this wouldn't be a good idea to adequately build the tension of what might happen to our happy adventurers.  This is the alien universe mind you, never know what kind of kitten is lurking around the corner...especially in the dark.  Alien built the tension slowly with expert precision, Aliens didnt have to do much at all since the story was a continuation of the first only with new kittens to kill (unfortunately) but Prometheus was back at square one, looking in a new direction, asking new BS questions which couldn't even explain or execute even at the fundamental or elementary level.<br /><br />But no, happy adventures continue adventuring, never skipping a beat, so when they start dropping like kittens, boyfriends get executed by way of hot woman in spandex wielding a flame thrower, you're left asking yourself, \\"why am I supposed to care again?  Was my attention supposed to be on hot woman doing her captainly thing by protecting the ship or the fact boyfriend died?\\".  If the story adequately fleshed out these characters, maybe I could have been faced with a conundrum, BUT I WASN'T, I was emotionally cold either way.  I wouldn't have cared if flaming boyfriend mustered the strength to flop down on hot woman to see them both burst into rainbows and flaming kittens...as cool as that thought would be, the point is I just didn't care about either character in any particular sense.<br /><br />...this is the stories fault and by extention, the directors fault which continues to hapazardly piece scenes together without so much as give a flying kitten about substance all the way to the very end which I won't spoil, but I sufficiently didn't care about that either.  Oh the substance is there in a very shallow sort of way, but at the end of the day, the only thing I did care about was the fact I just wasted $25 dollars on this drivel and my high hopes thoroughly extinguished sans end of ACT2.<br /><br />So can I recommend this movie?  I absolutely cannot to anybody who cares about story.  It certainly wasn't the acting talent, the actors however weren't even given a chance to put their talents to any particular good use with the exception of Michael Fassbenders - David the android...he did good.  However, if you get capitvated by big shiny things and pretty vista's like Transformers 2 - Revenge of the Kitten, I think this movie was made for you.  It's actually better than Transformers 2, but the very fact I'm comparing it to Transformers 2 is not a good thing.<br /><br />=/
B00846REIS|4.0|I have enjoyed The Crossfire series - although, as others have commented, it is bares a close resemblance to the Fifty Shades trilogy but this series is without any strong D/s or bdsm traits.<br />These books hold their own and the characters are very interesting and I feel like you get to know them well in the books. The mystery is continued and leaves you content with the current read, but hoping the next book will be out soon.<br />I would recommend this series and have re-read the first book and will re-read the second book as well.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|All I can say is wow.  It's not as good as the first album was.  The first album is fantastic.  One great song after another.  This one, feels like they were either not trying of trying way too hard.  The magic the first album had is gone in this one.  There are a couple of standout tracks, but nothing as grand as the first album.  Edit:  The more I listen to it the more I like it.  There are some really great stand out tracks on the album.  One of my favorite is Broken Crown,  but Hopeless Wanderer and Whispers in the Dark are also very good.

B00914JWSW|4.0|I have just heard the definitive version of \\"How Are Things in Glocca Morra?\\" and it's by that Funny Girl from Brooklyn. She bested herself on \\"Didn't We?\\" and \\"With One More Look at You\\" (even though the arrangement on the latter is hopelessly dated). \\"Being Good Isn't Good Enough\\" is very near perfect. When she and the material gibe, she can't be touched. Her voice and phrasing are truly breathtaking.<br /><br />Some of the selections seem a little overperformed and overdone. I can see why \\"Mother and Child\\" and \\"If It's Meant to Be\\" never made it to an album before. But I'll bet as you scroll through these reviews, you'll find fans who single those two songs as their favorites. Just because they didn't touch a chord with me doesn't mean they're duds. They just struck me as a little precious.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it plain it all the time buy it its free and awesome um ok then three words ok
0307592731|1.0|This is not a book about hiking. It is not a book about the Pacific Crest Trail or the mountains. It's about a self absorbed little girl. It's time that Strayed learns that she needs to pull up her big girl panties and get on with life. It is tragic that her mom died of cancer at so young an age. But to react to her death by cheating on your husband, sleeping with every other guy that you meet, and doing heroin is just pathetic. No one ever found love or happiness in another person's pants. It is time to grow up, cast aside your self indulgent pity, and be an adult.  Stop blaming everyone else and accept responsibility for yourself. This book is so bad that I could not finish it.I read about 200 pages and then had to quit.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its odd but very fun! the prides are cute and I love the bonus coin! the only thing bad about it is waiting thirty seconds every time you run out of coins just to get one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|awesome cant seem too put it down. love to play the app. fun game to play. cant put it down
B008JFC6F0|5.0|Don't get me wrong, Innerspeaker was a great album, but I find myself skipping over some of the tracks on that album because some of the songs are a little too repetitive for me and I get bored of them.<br /><br />However, this is not the case with Lonerism. I love every single song on this album and never have to skip tracks. There is not one song on this album that you will get bored of, every single song feels like electricity passing through your body. This album is filled with high energy and many surprises that you won't find on Innerspeaker.<br /><br />My favorite songs from this album are, \\"why won't they talk to me?\\", \\"feels like we only go backwards\\" and \\"nothing that has happened so far had been anything we could control\\".
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far the game seems interesting but i haven't gotten far so we shall see as I continue. graphics are cool and I love finding hidden items.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I enjoyed the book but if you don't know anything about that world and how it works don't try it please. You will like or hate it but you have to find that out for your self.
034580404X|5.0|I know now what all the rant and rave is about. This author writes this book very well. I can not put it down and wish I had all the time in the world to finish the series tomorrow
0307744434|4.0|My rating: 4/5 stars<br /><br />*May contain some spoilers*<br />Did you know there really is magic among us? Or that's what I believe after reading this book. There's two kids, Celia and Marco, who are chosen to be part of some silly competition between Celia's father and Marco's trainer. They don't know the rules, they don't know the game, they just know they have to practise nonstop, so when the time comes, they're ready.<br />Then the circus comes. Circus filled with magic. And your life is changed forever.<br /><br />If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be \\"breathtaking\\". Beautiful. Seductive. But I do feel conflicted. This book is amazingly visual, if you can say that about a book. There was just this magnificent beauty I can't get over with. And I must admit, I've never read anything like this. Author manages to paint the picture through words, and that is absolutely amazing talent (who can count \\"amazing\\"s in this review?). I just wanted to pick a brush and some paint and start painting the circus all over our appartment. I mean, how cool would that be?! Especially since I'm such a fan of black and white.<br />Not only does this author paint a vivid picture, but also manages to feed all the senses. Which you would think is impossible, but apparently not. All the smells and tastes are described so vividly, you can't help but get sucked into the story and picture it all. Actually, live it all.<br /><br />And then to why I felt conflicted. At first I had some trouble with the Lemony Snicket- kind of voice, especially since I kept hearing the narrator from the movie. So that gave me some trouble, but after the first 50 pages I got over it.<br />Then there's the competition. I usually have trouble since I'm so curious, and this was the problem this time too. I did realize the basic idea of the competition, but it's really hard to follow competition where there really is no guidelines. What is the goal, when can you say the game is over (well, we did get the answer for that..), what is the point in this competition, what are the rules in magic etc. There just was so many questions and not enough answers.<br /><br />I also did enjoy the romance, especially the few romantic moments there was. But I still felt like there was something missing, even though they were starcrossed lovers and I absolutely adored them. Guess the ending just kind of bugs me, and just makes me feel lost. I'm not sure if this was happy ending, or bad ending, or just a little satisfying ending or what. I'm officially confused. But still kind of awed most of the time.<br /><br />Love,<br />Monaliz @ Mind Reading?id get the answer for that..), what is the point in this competition, what are the rules in magic etc. There just was so many questions and not enough answers.<br /><br />I also did enjoy the romance, especially the few romantic moments there was.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I reluctantly read Fifty Shades Darker. I did not enjoy the first book at all but I had several friends telling me not to give up, that once I got through book one it would get much better. I have to disagree. The first book is nothing but porn, the second is only slightly better. I was hoping the story line would get better but... I ended up  scanning through the bedroom scenes (probably three fourths of the book). If they weren't having very descriptive B & D, they were fighting. The lip biting and twitchy palm got extremely boring!!! The only thing I did enjoy was the playful emails they sent back and forth. Needless to say, I will not be reading the third book.
0892818875|4.0|Whilst this book does not contain many new ideas, in that the information can be found in various books. It is a useful to have it all in one place and as such is a useful addition to your library.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it. it works great on my kindle and is very easy to use. its fun to look at everyones pins
B0086VWCPG|4.0|The thing I like most about Runtastic Pro is the pace feature.  Before, I was using mytracks, which is also great, but it didn't provide pace information, which is very nice to have while running!  The only downside is the fact that time doesn't automatically pause when you are stopped, which of course makes times inaccurate.  GPS seems to be very accurate.
B001I1K0B4|5.0|just learned you can sing the words to tune of ABCs and the kids love the book even more now.  Immediately when we get to the last page, they ask for more/read again. This should be in every child's book collection!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Two Snow White movies emerged this season.  Mirror Mirror directed by Tarsem Singh and this one.  I much preferred Mirror Mirror.  It is a clever comedy with sets and visuals that Singh is noted for. It was fun and a much better version of the Snow White story than this one.  The CGI and setting in that film worked with the picture.  In this film, some of the CGI was just bad.  The great white hart was awful, an affront to the lovers of Cernunos everywhere.<br /><br />Snow White and the Huntsman  has an interesting story line.  Ms Theron did an interesting job on the evil queen but aside from getting to over emote in a few places the director never let her go.  I wanted to see more of the Monster passion from her.  The huntsman was equally constrained.  The actress who played Snow White did a better job when she was dead.  She should play a tree in the next Tolkien movie.  Loved the dwarves. The rest of the cast just did not have much to do other than reciting lines in a very dull way.  Next time make the film from the dwarves' point of view.  And get those little magical creatures some women!  After all these years as second bananas each dwarf deserves a happy home!<br /><br />As a rental the film  it was fine....except for the very dark parts that did not show well on my computer.  I am glad I did not spend the big bucks in the theater. I did not fall asleep.  I only stopped it once to feed the cat.
1595827684|5.0|The Mass Effect universe is the best sci-fi gaming universe ever devised and the book \\"The Art of the Mass Effect Universe\\" gives readers a more behind-the-scenes look at how it all came together.  All three games are featured and readers will learn about why some of the artistic decisions were made about almost every single locale, species, ship, you-name-it.  Bottom line: this book is a must own for any fan of the Mass Effect gaming series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Because everyone keeps buying it, only to continulously complain about it. Yes it's shit<br /> We know<br />If you continue to purchase the book, it will remain a top seller. Ge over it and stop paying the talentless author.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|What a great product! The size is awesome and the quality is amazing.  I'd certainly recommend getting this if you have the space in your house for a disgustingly cool zombie head!  :D
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The reason I bought this book was because everyone was saying how good it was.  Yeah, good if you are looking for a porno to read.  As far a story with a good backbone? no.  I couldn't even finish the book.  It degrading to women.  This book is some mans fantasy of women submitting to being tortured and liking it. That to me is disgusting, repulsive, and could be a reason we have SO MANY sexual predators out there today.  Horrible.  If you are the 1 in 3 women out there who have been molested, raped, abused, or beaten.  DO NOT even think about reading this book.<br /><br />It's no wonder so few men have any respect for us women these days; they think this is how we WANT to be treated.  Like submissive dogs.  Makes me sick.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like that I can choose a random game or a game I know I can win. the hint button is useful.
B002E2QHBS|4.0|This a is a great release of some other uncommon tracks as never heard before on any other CD. The booklet information probably holds true of the chronological sequences of the artists appearances as order appearances are different from other releases.  The only downfall, is there are no tracks for Keef Hartley band where I can't find anywhere.  I think this release should of had more of the not so common tracks not found anywhere else and eliminate some of the common tracks that are found on other releases.  For all you die-hard Woodstock fans, I would recommend this release even though there are some common tracks heard on this release.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|Obviously, this movie and its story bears no resemblence whatsoever to the original children's story. It's more like a lame werewolf story done in the style of Twilight Saga... the character of Peter - Red Riding Hood's lover - even looks like Edward from Twilight. Then, there's all the weird and pointless details; like the twenty foot long cape Red Riding Hood drags behind her, or the severed hand she carries around in her basket, or the fact that her father turns out to be the werewolf. (Oops... did I give away the ending?)  The movie is full of story cliches and over-used camera tricks. The story is choppy and uninteresting. The dialog is drab and uninspired. The acting is only marginal - though Gary Oldmam does his best... unfortunately in a role unworthy of his talent. I give it two stars for fairly good cinematography and wolf effects. But, that's the best I could offer. This movie is a stinker... albeit highly stylized and technically artsy, but a stinker, nonetheless.
B006H5120E|5.0|This movie is fantastic in 3D. I like the Blu-ray movie but this is so much better. This set allows you to view the movie in any way you choose. I would highly recommend.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I won't say why it didn't work because I don't want to give it away, but once it was revealed, I wasn't impressed and it made the last part of the story sag instead of finishing on a high note. I also felt she tied the problems up between the couple a little too neatly.
0439023521|5.0|The plot is very fast-paced and an easy read. Once you pick it up everything continues to flow nicely together and easily time passes by before you know it is even done. How can it not flow so quick when the protagonist spends more than half the book in a life or death situations?<br /><br />The book is much better than the movie, so if you are looking for the book since you saw the movie, prepare for it to be so much better.<br /><br />one side note- after seeing battle royale, it kinds of seemed a bit like a knock-off- still a good book- just not coming off as so origional now
B003UYUP58|5.0|This is an amazing book, I was unable to put it down. I lost my mother and my stepmother to breast cancer and have studied the history of cancer treatments pretty thoroughly but I was unaware of the political history. The book that this one reminds me most of is: And the Band Played On, another medical history that reads like a good mystery. Beautiful work! If you want to see my response to cancer... check out my blog.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is truly an epic adventure movie with gads of special effects and captivating from the beginning moments to the finale.  Every super hero had the plenty of film time to showcase their super powers.
0345803493|2.0|The only way i have gotton through these books is to imagine William Levy as Christian.<br />I hope they cast him in the movie.
B008KOMMTA|3.0|The overall box set is very nice especially the reprints/news paper. The only compliant is the book was poorly made the binding fell apart and it was brand new ...so for the price you should expect better quality .... But over all a very nice box set
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|What a simple yet great game!  Entertaining and fun. I've reached level 126 and still having a great time with it!
B004JN1CW4|3.0|WICKED has claimed that it is done and the trails are over. They have the information  that they need and they can now restore all their old memories. Thomas decides to decline even after he finds most of the gladers are immune to the flare but not all. Thomas finds himself on the run again after WICKED decides that he is the missing link they need to complete the cure. If there even is one.<br /><br />This series turned into an end of the world zombie take over. We get to see a ton of cranks first hand in this book and even see one of the supporting characters turn into one. If you want more zombie books to read, this is a good series to read. So we are left wondering if Thomas will choose his own safety or the possibility for a cure. Overall it was a good book, but I just felt it was lacking in some details. The first book was the best of the books thus far.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Bad and<br />Good collide in this very risque novel. Fast read & quite entertaining if you can stomach the content. Not for those who can't deal with porn.  Am on to the second in this series.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie was excellent, and full of action..have watched it a few times since I got it. I would recommend it very highly.
B008J34466|5.0|Dear P!nk,<br /><br />Thank you for being awesome. I cannot even begin to tell you how much I needed you to make this album. As a new mom, your music reminds me that life is not over after a baby. I can still rock. Like you.<br /><br />Love,<br />Dorie<br /><br />PS - I would love to live inside your head for a day.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Mr. Child is one of my favorite authors.  Once again he thrills us with an exceptionally well written Jack Reacher story.  Lee takes us back to the beginning and gives us the details of why Jack became disenchanted, or better said, disenfranchised from the U.S. Army.  Lee, with his supreme skill in exposition, will plant you into this thriller as Jack's partner.  As you read on, you feel like you are sitting across from the actual plot as it unfolds.  I have read every book Lee Child has written, and I must confess I am sad I am getting to the current novels.  Excellent job Lee!!
B004UNX1LS|2.0|I used to love this app it was super convenient and great but now it just crashes and wont let me watch videos or anything!!! please please fix it!!!!???
0385738765|3.0|Thomas thought he had escaped the trials, but in reality he only escaped the maze in a very elaborate hox. Now he and his friends find they must cross the waste land that once was populated by normal humans but is now populated by the people infected with the disease. Dangers hide behind every turn, yet Thomas is determined to make it out again.<br /><br />Cranks: This theme is very similar to the current zombie theme. Cranks are slowly going mad and start eating others and themselves. So be forewarned, this is a bit of a zombie series from here on out. The first book did not hint that this would turn into zombies, but this book it did. Also this book was very repetative to the first book.<br /><br />I;d recomend this to those that like the whole zombie genre.
B008NW67E0|2.0|i've heard there  stuff and its a  cool mixture of the folkys  sounding  stuff which at times can lead to a hybrid of other things, however  they fall into a phrase called  \\"Sleepy time Music\\" which works well with Coffee and  rainy  days,  however it doesn't do much for me wide awake and there material sounds like one long song which has some nice moments here and there, however  nothing that to  me  merits the hype they are getting.  they  have talent,  however they have found a formula early on and they  seem content on it, which will work  for folks who accept that from them, however others it feels played out before it had a fully good chance at developing.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|...get past the kinky sex and you have a good romance story regardless of what some women will tell you. I couldn't wait to find out the reason for Christian's obcession and Anestasia's relentless devotion to him...can't wait to read the final book to see if their love survives.
B0095R64AO|4.0|I ended up picking this movie while playing hookie from work one day. Jason Segel is a hit or miss actor, which kept me from watching this movie any other time.  But i kept an open mind as I was eager and desperate for a good romantic comedy.  Turns out, This is just what my fictitious doctor doctor ordered!  It was refreshing to have a romantic comedy be unpredictable and yet relative to modern day relationship issues.  of course they were a few over the top moments, but with a strong supporting cast it kept Segel grounded making for a true feel good romantic comedy.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I EXPECTED TO 'GET STUCK' AT A CERTAIN POINT  LIKE A FEW OTHER GAMES WHERE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO MOVE ON UNTIL YOU SUCCEED -LIKE NO ESCAPE. BUT THIS GAME IS TOTALY FUN!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I am new fan of this group and was so excited to hear about a new album. I downloaded it the day it came out and cannot stop listening to it!  I LOVE it.
0439023491|4.0|Again, the books fly by quickly. As with several other trilogies I have read, book two leaves on a cliffhanger before picking it up in book three. I would not appreciate this much if all three had not already been published when I read them. I prefer each book to end with enough ending to keep the reader happy, while still wanting more.<br /><br />I missed the old Peeta from the first book that was gone by the start of the third book. But that is what is great about books in general and this one also, you can actually miss a fictional character.<br /><br />I liked the first book better than this one, but this was good also.
B008RYN44U|2.0|No doubt had  alot more energy  when  they first came out and  for  the past few  albums they  just have settled and  made  ok  music and  also well polished  formula  based production.  hearing this  album recently  nothing  stood out and it felt like it was  just put together to say an album was out.  they use to at least  have a groove or something that could carry something out, however here it just doesn't work and there ain't one money track here either. sometimes an act is better left alone as you know it, then for it to become watered down like Crystal  Lite.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really liked the game. Solitaire is one of my favorite games to play to fill time and I am very pleased with this version. You can choose to play multiplayer and select either random deal or winning deal. The game also keeps track of your winning records. I think the game deserves 5 stars or at least 4
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|they should lower the price........ oh well......... anyway what made this game really scary was the name.......... why? ........ oh because I live on a street called........ maple creek Dr.
B008I34YYY|1.0|So I've been following Iron Sky for months, right?  Watched the trailers and was intrigued, right?  Waited and waited for a chance to see it, right?  Got the DVD from Amazon and couldn't wait, right?  Horrible movie.  Sub-B-grade.<br /><br />What would you have if you had some cool computers and could do CGI in your sleep, but had no story-writing ability at all but still you wanted to make a movie that included all kinds of stuff in it concerning a culture that you obviously knew nothing about and some science fiction that wasn't really \\"science\\" fiction because you don't really get the science part?  You'd have a chance to make a horrible movie.<br /><br />I think I made it 20 minutes into the movie before I had to stop.  I'll wait a few weeks to calm down and master my disappointment and then cut the DVD into tiny little pieces so no one else is accidentally injured by this...this...movie.<br /><br />I realize I'm taking this personally, but I really was hyped up on this one.  Science that isn't science, humor that isn't funny, a black guy with dialogue out of a bad film from the 1960s, language from a high school...I could go on and on, but I don't have any more stuff for this part.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend it only if you collect terrible films.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Movie is visually amazing, and was a very refreshing spin on the classic fairytale. Charlize Theron was great as the evil queen!
0439023513|4.0|There is death in this book and there were a lot of characters that do not suvive. At one point it felt like no one was going to survive. While Katniss' growth was very well depicted, I wished for a happier ending for her. By the time you see Peeta again in the third book, you can tell a happy ending will be hard to come by.<br /><br />It was a nice end to the trilogy though the first book was the best in the bunch.
0316228532|2.0|It's not just that this book is unlike the Harry Potter books, it's that it lacks the range, beauty, clarity, height, breadth, imagination and compassion of those books. I didn't just feel disappointed-- because this is an author I truly love-- what I felt was more like grief. No, I did not read the whole thing. I couldn't. I'm going to return it and hope for the very best next time around.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game it is the best game ever in the whole world I hope everyonebhas this game I love making stuff on it it is so fun to play every one should have it or have it because it is Dutch a good game give it five stars
030758836X|3.0|It was ok. The writing style was great. Characters sucked you in. It really gave you a look inside a psychopath's life. But did I love the book? Not really. The beginning was slow and ending wasn't where I thought it should go. The middle was pretty good, but not good enough to make up for the rest. Overall, it didn't live up to the hype.
B007V0Q8HQ|5.0|I am a big The Script fan. I downloaded the Mp3 album on October 9 and have heard the album about 8-9 times.<br /><br />Science and Faith fans may be slightly dissappointed as I feel The Script have not offered as much variety in their sound on #3.<br /><br />The Script (first album) fans will be overjoyed as the album is one continous journey from song to song.<br /><br />So is #3 worth 9.99? For The Script fans, yes. For newcomers to The Script, absolutely yes.<br /><br />I LOVE The Script and I am LOVING their new album overall. The lyrics are beautiful, the melodies uplifting and the music blends just right, its The Script making music to melt your bones and stir your soul. I am so grateful The Script are around so I can savor their unique soft rock, hip hop and plain old GREAT sound.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have now played this game now on multiple devices and thouroughly enjoyed this game enough to play through all the levels puzzles and gotten each prizefighter totally addictive
0679745203|5.0|The best romance book for all seasons, especially if you are visiting or living in An Arabic country with desert, the words chosen are passion heated, the description and details real  and if you can listen to the soundtrack when reading, it will be graved into your heart!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written, interesting couldn't put it down. First gear thing I've ready in a long time. I read this book in a couple of days.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|graphics and playability are nice. other things are somewhat silly and facebook-esque. overall not a bad app. 4 out of 5.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app but if they fixed it to were you can put parentaseis in your problem that would be great.
B007SGM084|5.0|I found this book very entertaining while very unorthadox! It was refreshing to find an author that thinks outside the box so to speak.... I did really like it and hope to read more from this author.  If not about the same something slightly different.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This album just gets me moving. I just absolutely love musicals if you are a musical fan you will enjoy Burlesque.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|First person account of the killing.  After all the hype, it was great to read a simple account of the Ben Laden search and killing without the hype, exagerations, chest pounding and half-truths.  An \\"easy read.\\" On an emotional level one feels it is truthful; understands the complexity of the mission; and appreciates the training and tenacity necessary to do this kind of job.  Thanks
B005EWDA3I|3.0|I'm not english speaker so forgive me...<br />Comparing to part 1&2, this book almost have no plot, Chapters after afters of thoughts and wondering,  Like the author got tired of the book.<br />Only the momentum from first two parts keeps me reading.<br />But things became better near the end.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I'm not sure that one should rate such a great piece of literature as Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer, for it is truly all-time classics. Must read.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|First let me start off by saying, I don't have a scanner and I really needed an important document scanned immediately and it was the middle of the night. So as a last resort I was like \\"hmm...I wonder if there's an app for that\\", low and behold CamScanner exists. There are probably a gazillion scanner apps on GooglePlay, so keep in mind this review is just of this one and I know nothing about the others.<br /><br />It's a fantastic free app that got the job done extremely fast an efficiently. At first you'll rage a little when you're trying to take a \\"picture\\" of your item, because it seems all blurry, ignore it, put the camera where you want it and even though it's blurry take the picture BHAM, instantly it gets clear. The cool thing is, if you want it to look like a professional copy it gives you the option to move four little squares at odd angles even to just show what you're wanting in the scan, super helpful.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars, because I was able to email the document to myself in two seconds after taking the picture and cropping, very nice.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Just started reading hope book is good.......expecting  some really difficult words to understand to improve English language     better really looking forward
B003O86FMW|5.0|I personally think it was better than the first book. I can't wait for the movie, it will be amazing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Would enjoy more if game didn't want tl money, but that wont change.  stiill pretty fun, would play game again
0316228532|4.0|This an incredibly difficult book to review, because I had such mixed feelings about it over the course of reading. In the beginning, I found it surprisingly vulgar (not just because it's JKR, but more so than many other adult books I've read), and I also thought it was somewhat slow. To an extent the vulgarity comes from the kinds of characters Rowling portrays, but in my opinion she takes it further than she has to.<br /><br />That being said, by the end the book had become something of a pageturner for me (though not for everyone), and I wanted to find out what happened. It is remarkable that characters I didn't like or identify with became people I actually cared about by the close of the novel. Despite the amount of people Rowling follows throughout the book, I never did find a character I identified with, which was unexpected. Ironically, it is the exact opposite in the Potter series - even the antagonists are appealing and likeable in a certain way.<br /><br />Obviously this book has nothing to do with Harry Potter or the Wizarding World, and when readers compare the two, the Casual Vacancy looks even bleaker, because not everything works out in this world, and the good guys don't always win. The novel is in a completely different genre for a vastly different audience, and if you can accept it on those terms, you stand a chance of enjoying it, although it is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, and would have been a hard sell even without the shadow of the Potter books looming over it.<br /><br />It is not a murder mystery as some early descriptions portrayed it, although it does have kind of a \\"Desperate Housewives\\" meets Jane Austen feel in terms of the sly humor Rowling uses to depict modern-day small town English society. While the characters are developed, they are also purposely caricatures, parodying real life. Samantha, Shirley, and Maureen are the gossipy women whose cheeks flush with excitement when they hear about the neighbors' tragedies - there is a particularly funny moment when Maureen hears an ambulance and steps outside, hoping \\"to taste the tang of disaster,\\" not realizing the ambulance is for a loved one of hers.<br /><br />Andrew and Gaia, two teenagers, were some of my favorite characters to follow because they had redeeming qualities. Andrew is angry but justifiably so, because his father Simon beats him, and simultaneously he has a sweet quality when pining after beautiful Gaia, who originally lived in London. Gaia is angry her mother Kay made her move to tiny Pagford, especially since Kay did it for a man, Gavin, who is barely interested in her. Kay is shown as dependent, clingy, and controlling with Gavin, yet we see a whole other side of her when she becomes the social worker for the Weedons, one of the families that live in the Fields, the poor, dilapidated area of town. As a social worker, Kay is firm but kind, and tries to work with the Weedon family instead of against them.<br /><br />Krystal Weedon is loud, reckless, confused, unrefined, and often offensive to people around her, though not necessarily intentionally. Barry Fairbrother, the councilman who died at the beginning of the novel, had taken Krystal under his wing as the rowing coach at her school. He had a positive fatherly influence on her, and she took his death very hard. Krystal makes countless mistakes, often alarmingly costly ones, but many of them stem from ignorance, poor judgment, and desperation.<br /><br />There are so many characters that it would be difficult to discuss them all, but at heart this is a psychological character novel. Tessa the school counselor has a compassionate point of view that is easy to latch onto when likeable characters are hard to come by. Her teenaged son, Fats, best friends with Andrew, is genuinely concerned with being as authentic as possible, but he takes this to the extreme, letting his ego get the best of him to the point that he believes he can do whatever he wants without consequences. It seems a huge oversight that Tessa, as a counselor, never tried to get Andrew to talk about his father Simon's rages, because she had seen a glimpse of one when the boys were younger. Instead, Andrew tries to deal with his father's abuse on his own.<br /><br />Teenaged Sukhvinder, whose family is Sikh, struggles with extreme self-hatred and bullying at school. Her tale is wrapped up a bit too neatly when she attempts to play hero in a dire situation. I was surprised to feel sympathy for Samantha Mollison, one of the gossipy women mentioned above, who organically gets a crush on one of the members of a boy band that her daughter likes, in part because she isn't getting anything out of her marriage and has realized that her husband is a bit of a buffoon. She begins to have a secret inner world and plots a way to see the band in concert on their tour.<br /><br />Because it's Rowling, I expected her to do something with the ruined abbey at the top of a hill in Pagford. It's described several times, but never plays a pivotal role. The description of Andrew and Fats' hideaway, in contrast, is so treacherous that I was unsurprised to see it reemerge near the end of the novel during a climactic scene.<br /><br />I give this book four stars because I did end up enjoying it, independently of the Potter novels, but at the same time, I expect the majority of people to give it a three or two star rating. In my opinion it is as well written as an average adult novel, though more predictable than Potter, and I was not moved to tears like I was during the last three HP books. It is great to see Rowling tackle completely different topics, and despite the backlash she's receiving from moving outside of the public's comfort zone, I think she has succeeded in what she was trying to do..

B008XG1X18|4.0|I'm obsessed with pinterest...but only giving this app a 4 out of 5 due to the fact that before opening (every time) it has to force close at least once. fix for a 5. :)
B004H4XAXO|5.0|The book was amazing. Having never read any of his previous works I was unprepared for just how brilliant this was. His unique take on magic within the novel and the immediate immersion into already active storylines is a mechanism with which I am familiar, from the Malazan book of the fallen, and to be fair this series may just give that one a run for its money. Needless to say I am eagerly awaiting the next book...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm so glad that \\"Mark Owen\\" decided to write this book.  As a civilian we all think, \\"Gosh, I really appreciate the men and women of the military and all that they sacrifice!\\"  and then we go pick up our children from soccer practice, or meet our friends for coffee, or go home and make dinner in our safe homes.  Never once have I knowingly or otherwise walked into a situation where my life was in imminent danger, much less function in that situation.<br />I had no true understanding of the amount of time they spent working and away from their families.  The author helped me to understand their dilema of wanting to be with their family, but their SEAL brothers were also their family and their need in their souls to serve.  These men are amazing, and I'm so glad the author included foundation information at the end of the book.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|A friend o f mine recommended this book so I bought it. That´s why at the beginning I didn´t have a big expectation about it but it really surprise me!<br /><br />I read the 500 pages in only 2 weeks and I already bought the book number two.<br /><br />You have to read it! You are going to experience something new, learn some things and you´ll love.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Watched it for art class. Loved it! Really a sweet and awkward movie. Way better than anything  with every body's favorite quirky actress Zooey D. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. I frackin hate romantic films and this is definitely a romantic film but was amazingly different and incredibly lovable and watchable. I give it 10 stars drawn with skerples!!!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Entertaining, lots of fun...adults and kids would enjoy it!!!!! Easy to figrue out, but challenging in play. Good addition to

B0095VPAVE|5.0|The graphics for this processor do not miss a beat.  Super clean and fast.  I played GRAND THEFT AUTO: CHINATOWN WARS and the graphics were insane. Never saw a hickup the entire game: smooth and incredible! If in the market an afordable processor, I highly recommend it.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I repeat, you are an idiot if you gave this show one star. Without a doubt the best show on television at the moment.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I play this frequently, or at least I did.  It worked great on my Kindle Fire 1st Generation.  I could do the larger pieces with the tiles set to rotate while my 3yr old grandson does them at the smallest number of tiles & no rotation.  It really keeps him busy.<br /><br />The number of free puzzles available to download through the software is fabulous.  I was cautious to buy packs that way as I wasn't sure if they would stay in my \\"account\\" if anything happened (like my grandson de-registering the device) as I noticed the free ones didn't stay & had to be re-downloaded.<br /><br />I am really hoping that this will be updated for the HD.
B0002Z0EYA|1.0|I first saw Troy in the wide screen format even though full screen would have been my preference. I am so GLAD it happened that way. When I sat down to watch the greatly anticipated \\"full screen\\" I couldn't believe my eyes or my ears. Some the very most important dialog had been cut; the musical score had been changed in some scenes to something one would expect to hear in the common variety battle scenes of a \\"B\\" movie....instead of the unique, stirring, notes that remain with you long after the film has ended. The dialog? I'll give you the most damaging deletion in the film....THE pivotal lines that gave Achilles his powerful purpose and reason for going to Troy...he chose glory AND doom, and KNEW what it was he chose and how it would end for him. It was his complete conversation with his mother on the beach as she gathered sea shells. At the movies beginning, a young boy tells Achilles it is said Achilles' mother is an immortal God. We know from Greek Mythology Achilles was dipped in water as an infant....that anywhere on his body the water touched could not be injured to the point of causing his death. His mother held by the heel as she dipped him in the water....his heel was not covered with water and was his only weakness. She was a Goddess.....one who could see into the future. It is this reason Achilles comes to talk to her before deciding whether to go to Troy. The lines that were cut came after she said his glory and doom would come together. He asks her \\"You KNOW this to be true, Mother?\\" (No mistake? No mother's attempt to keep him home?you see this in the future?) She answered, \\" I KNOW this.\\". Consider these lines...really consider them, THEN watch Troy again. There are other cuts in dialog that dilute the character and, if you will, also the full robust/richness of the other salient characters. The story it's self is the stuff of legends and myths, and is perhaps a tribute to one man's series of mistakes in judgment, King Priam. His son, Hector was commander of his armies...but he never ONCE listens to his counsel...opting to chose the exact opposite. And by the way....he gives Paris the \\"sword of Troy\\" to fight with....what about giving it to Hector as he goes out to fight. Achilles? Hector is the only souce of wisedom and solid common sense, millitary savvy in Troy. One wonders if King Priam finally \\"gets it\\" as he watches Troy being burned to the ground. Buy the wide screen version, you will enjoy and become enthralled in it's mastery and magic.BTW...the color and sharpness of the full screen version is also really crummy....sub-standard. OK...I am being too practical here. But can you imagine the volume of fish caught to feed 50,000 men a day? As far as that goes...what about the volume of human waste and garbage deposited into the sea EVERY DAY in that bay or inlet (perhaps vegetarianism began right there)? You know, come to think of it we may just have located the first massive plight of toxic waste in that part of the world (yes,\\" toxic\\" imagine yourself as a one man/woman clean up detail...then tell me it wasn't toxic). Fish fry anyone?!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This is a book that, to me, is surprisingly objective in its nature.  I am still reading the book but to this point, the way Jaycee Dugard dealt with her kidnappers showed amazing insight by a very young lady into how she might best stay alive.  She is a remarkable person and would be interesting to meet.  Very well-written also but makes me have no doubt that she and she alone was author of this book.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this because everyone else seems to be reading it; poor excuse on my part.  It is a fantasy, a very erotic one and real romp in the hay. I can't say that I enjoyed it, the story becomes repetitious; it could be called 1001 ways to act out sexual fantasies. The lead character, Anastasia, seems clueless about what is happening to her as she is \\"courted\\" by a very troubled wealthy man.  For those who love to escape into to a trashy novel occasionally, this must be the place.

B005PR44XC|5.0|Both very informative and humorous, it provides a deeper insight into why countries fell apart economically. This is written in an entertaining and easy to understand manner. You don't need to be financially literate to get through this book successfully. It's also a major eye opener to the realities of how economies were managed in the selected European nations. Quite a concern really. It makes you wonder what hope there is for the continuation of the Eurozone as it currently functions.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I bought it for my girlfriend and ended up making it my favorite show. Cant wait for season 3! Im on my way to halloween horror night right now
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved these books! Relatable characters, surreal setting, and just a great story.  I'm glad all 5 books came bundled together, since I didn't even have to pause in between them to buy another.  Now I'm off to buy the prequel...
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|This movie dragged on for a little while from the beginning.  I started to get a little bored, but soon overcame it.  My favorite part was what the, \\"Hulk\\" did to the bad guy Loki.  I think I spelled his name right.  I kept rewinding it, which made me laugh more every time.<br /><br />Iron Man got a lot more camera time, while I feel, \\"Thor\\" was a little slighted.  Robert Downey Jr. provided some comedy as usual.  The costumes were awesome and every actor was suited for their character role in my opinion.  The fight scenes were terrific.  The Hulk commanded attention all over the place, and definitely got it.  Over all, the movie is entertaining, a little long, super charged, and fun to watch.<br /><br />The blu-ray shows great.  However, they did place some of the dics on top of one another.  I had to place two in separate cases, which was a let down.  I am happy that I bought this four movie combo when Amazon sold it for $19.99.  A pretty good deal indeed, compared to the prices right now.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I have to say that I'm very disappointed to find out that this movie has the horrible ASPECT RATIO of 2.40:1.<br /><br />WHY SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS ASPECT RATIO?:<br />For those of us who already hate the so called \\"black bars\\" on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie, the Aspect Ratio of 2.40:1 on 3D Home viewing brings back those horrible \\"Black Bars\\" and with that TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT MAKES 3D WORTH THE PURCHASE TO BEGIN WITH, minimizing the effect by a big percentage.<br /><br />Usually I don't mind those \\"black bars\\" on 2D viewing, maybe because we are all used to it by now, plus it doesn't take anything away...BUT ON 3D viewing this is the complete opposite.<br /><br />SO WHAT'S THE \\"APPROPRIATE\\" ASPECT RATIO THAT SHOULD BE IN 3D HOME MOVIES?<br />Most 3D movies right now are NOT being released with the desirable Aspect Ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole 3D effect BUT movies like Wrath Of The Titans, The Avengers, and the soon to be released AVATAR 3D, are some of the very few that could display with an average Aspect Ratio of: 1.78:1 WHICH WILL take advantage of the FULL SCREEN of your New 3D TV as you expected to display from day one.<br /><br />With that said, This movie unfortunately does NOT support that type of Aspect Ratio which makes it NOT worth the extra few dollars on the 3D Bluray version.<br /><br />Even with an enormous TV set you wouldn't want to watch a 3D movie with the black bars because...the bigger the TV, the bigger the \\"black bars\\" .<br /><br />ABOUT THE MOVIE IN GENERAL:<br />I did like this movie when I went to see it in IMAX 3D, I think that was the best way to see back then, now that is on 3D for home viewing...not so much unless it gets re-released with the \\"proper\\" Aspect Ratio.<br /><br />STORY:<br />The Story is not groundbreaking as it certainly leaves more questions than answers opened...but it's not bad at all, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS:<br />The Special Effectswere really good in my opinion, it certainly makes you think you're in a different world far away from Earth.<br /><br />ABOUT THE 3D Elements:<br />Although this movie was made with 3D in mind, it doesn't take full adventage and capabilities of the 3D technology as it should have been done, that alone the \\"Black Bars\\" found in the 3D Bluray version will ruin the experience even more.<br /><br />If you have a 3D TV and a 3D BluRay player, this movie might not do justice to the 3D part of it, and that alone just think on the bluray 2D version instead.

B006LSZECO|2.0|This is not my normal type of novel.  Bt it such great reviews,I bought it. All I can say my Kindle showed 58% read before it got interesting.  Very slow moving.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The thing to remember when reading this book is not to focus to much on the actual writing style. The author isn't a literary genius, it is an easy quick read. The story line is a good mix of love, drama, and pleasure. I would recommend this book to most people, who have a little bit of an open mind. If nothing else read simply to do your own psych eval on the characters.

B004LWZWC4|5.0|Funny! I expect you will enjoy this movie, even if you are not a birder. But as a birder I was skeptical that the movie would mock my avocation. Not at all! It highlights the experiences of a novice, intermediate and veteran birder, and makes birders laugh at themselves. The movie is light-hearted, realistic, funny and has some reflective moments. Try it!

B00448SE4S|5.0|If you're a fan of video games, this movie is absolutely 100% made for you. Stylistically, it hits the ball outta the park. If you aren't into video games and/or just don't quite understand them, you will miss out on many of the nuances that gamers throughout the years have come to understand and appreciate. Every aspect is perfect fan-service and I highly recommend this film to anyone with even remote interest. Remember: don't think of it as a film, think of it as a game.

0525953728|5.0|This book was rivoting and I could not put it down.  I did not think there was anything given away that should have been kept secret.  The only think is, the author stated things about President Obama which I did not care for but everybody is entitled to their opinions.  But as a military person, he should not let his feelings be known about how he feels about the president of the US (whoever that might be).  When he said that Obama would take credit for all of this and he believes that Obama did take credit.  Well, he is the president and without him authorizing the mission it would not have been done.  I do not want to take anything away from what these brave men did that night.  Thank God for people like them who train and do the job without wanting all the acalades for doing the job, they evidently love doing.  Thank you all.<br /><br />God Bless<br />Jeanie Fentz
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Well if your a fan of Sci-fi, you can't miss out on this one. From the very beginning it plants in your mind that you are in for a ride and you won't be able to get off until it's over... The suspense of being basically being confronted by things very big and beyond comprehension comes on in steps...<br /><br />There is so much going on once it gets going after about 1 hour in you realize damn, the minute they made contact on this planet they changed history.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie is very errie and you at already left saying WTF is going on... What have i gotten my mind into lol. I remember the original Alien i never saw it in the theatre too young, but i did see it eventually in the late 80's... In Space no one can hear you scream, but on LV-223 the whole planet will hear you scream... In horror!<br /><br />**SPOILER**<br /><br />Once you see the humanoid alien and realize they are malevolent you really take a blank in your pants, because as powerful as they are, they turn out to be nasty heartless cold killers.<br /><br />There is a twist that actually turns out that they have been on a mission to destroy humans on earth and that's because we are a failed experiment, WE are them but only WE aren't as ruthless as they are and in fact we actually have compasion and conscious something i think they did not want in their genetic manipulations, so we had been deemed failed and should be exterminated, i also get the feeling that humans {the one's with compasion} pose some sort of threat to them... I think they had planned to exterminate humans when they saw the direction they turned, cooperating living together in peace (for the most part), helping each other. I think humans were supposed to be them only in our part of the Universe... I think their whole goal is to put themselves all over the Universe. The only cliffhanger is what happens if they conquer the Universe? What then? What is their ultimate goal? The next 3 movies hopefully will shed some light on this mystery...<br /><br />I can tell you i actually felt uneasy in the first contact scene toward the end of the movie... I always had an unsettling feeling about that Space Jockey in the Pilots seat of the Alien ship from the first movie, and once this scene plays out it's like knowing you should not look under your bed and when you do B A M ! Your were right! Why oh why did you look under the bed!!! LOL<br /><br />The Alien wakes up after being asleep for 2000 years! Then it proceeds to kick everyone's @$$!<br /><br />The Alien also had in one scene an evil aggressive malevolent sarcastic grin or grimace, almost an internal hatred of the Humans you could feel it. You could actually feel it's mission, it's detestment toward the humans... Terrible and EPIC at the same time!<br /><br />Warning to you if you haven't seen some of the best SCi-fi horrors, like Event Horizon, or Saturn 6... Bewary this might mess with your mind.<br /><br />I loved it! It pulled no punches and is as horrific as you could want!<br /><br />Oh yeah and you will be waiting from the beginning of the movie to see the automated surgery capsule scene! Truely Legendary!!!

B006TF6WAM|4.0|The Author was new to me but the title caught my interest.  A very human story, where the (few) major characters all had their own trials and tribulations.  From the blandness of his day to day life, Harold sets out on impulse but with a strong belief.  He meets some inspiring people along his pilgrimage which strengthens his ultimate aim.  They all had their quirks, problems, ideals .. and he does question the challenge he has set himself.  But in his solitude he can find his love of life and re-ignite his faded marriage.<br /><br />I enjoyed the read very much.  I always like a happy ending!

B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I think this is Jane Austen's best novel.  Its main character is lovable but incredibly flawed.  Her saving grace is that she is prepared to acknowledge her repeated errors.  The other characters are also both interesting and believable, though the hero Mr Knightley is a bit too good to be true - but then most of Austen's heroes are a bit bloodless except for Darcy and perhaps Willoughby.  Emma, the novel, is also a mystery.  Both the two subsidiary leads, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax seem to have secrets which are not revealed until the end of the novel.  The backdrop of privilege and patronage with its ever present snobbery and prejudice are gently but critically presented.  Austen's most satirical, most humourous work
B0000041Q3|5.0|This is a perennial favorite among opera recordings, and justly so.  It is fairly clearly the best recording of Puccini's problematic and unfinished last opera, as the singing is at the very least solid all around, and the conducting (for once in a Turandot recording) exciting and propulsive.  It is so much more widely available than any other version, this is almost certainly what you'll end up with if you're new to the opera; still, if you become a fan, this should be supplemented by other sets with their own glories, even if none reaches the all-around strength of this Decca set.<br /><br />First, the singing: on paper, neither Sutherland nor Pavarotti looks like an ideal lead for this opera, both being more properly bel canto specialists who (like almost everyone else) ventured into the heavier repertoire at mid-career.  Indeed, perhaps only Ghiaurov and Pears are known as good singing actors; Caballé, like the other two leads, was never famous for good characterization.  However, what they all are famous for is spectacular voices, and everyone here is recorded pretty much at his or her best: the studio environment allows Sutherland and Pavarotti's voices a bit more weight than they might have otherwise carried in late Puccini, and both sing with remarkable evenness and laser-precise high notes.  Indeed, Sutherland's comparative lack of \\"steel\\" gives her a sort of advantage over the sometimes very unattractive voices that tackle the role of Turandot -- it makes her marginally more vulnerable and likable as a heroine (and in her early lines, like \\"In Questa Reggia,\\" La Stupenda keeps things chilly enough).  Pavarotti was never more golden-toned and secure than here (well, okay, maybe in L'Elisir, but this is close), and he makes a passionate, uncomplex Calaf.  Caballé's Liù is flawlessly beautiful; the only exponent of this role I've heard come close is Barbara Hendricks on Karajan's set (which has its own strengths, but is let down by a truly painful Turandotfrom Katia Ricciarelli).  No, none of them gets a lot of psychological depth out of these characters, but this large-scale, fairy tale pageant doesn't lend itself to dramatic depth, anyway.  It is more important that the voices be good and exciting, capable of conveying the beauty of these nearly-perfect vocal lines.  Casting is pretty luxurious all throughout, with Ghiaurov and Pears making much more out of their small roles as Timur and L'Imperatore Altoum than most singers manage.<br /><br />Second, the conducting of Zubin Mehta is really one of the glories of this set, and for me, the one thing that sets it clearly above the competition.  Mehta is still very active in the music world as of 2012, having just conducted and recorded a very innovative staging of Wagner's Ring in Spain, but he gets more than his share of negative press, which is a shame.  A bit like Lorin Maazel, another veteran conductor who is regularly panned nowadays but made some of the greatest opera recordings ever in the middle of the century (e.g. his Tosca, or his recording of the two Ravel operas), Mehta deserves more credit for some absolutely stunning operatic work, and this is one of the crown jewels.  Where most conductors seem to struggle just to keep the big ensembles together in Turandot, sometimes adopting willful tempi or checking out and leaving the drama up to the singers, Mehta is an attentive accompanist, and the LSO responds well to his direction.  One need only listen to the final duet as conducted by Mehta, and as conducted by Franco Molinari-Pradelli on the obvious second-choice recording with Corelli and Nillson: in the latter, it seems that the conductor has largely checked out, and so the remarkable high energy that Corelli and Nillson always generated together goes almost unsupported.  In Mehta's reading, the orchestra is always present, and the line is always given good, brisk shape.  Yet he never rushes, either, as Gavazzeni is prone to on the live set (also with Nilsson and Corelli).  The John Alldis Choir is also top-rank, very exciting in the first act, particularly, even if the pronunciation isn't always as idiomatic as it could be.<br /><br />There are other really good sets to check out, however.  The ending of this opera has been completed more than once, so while Valery Gergiev's DVD version from the Salzburg Festival is poorly cast and unusually poorly conducted, it remains the only widely-available document of the Luciano Berio ending, and is of interest for that reason.  Any version, studio or bootleg, with Nilsson and Corelli is worth owning; indeed, the EMI Molinari-Pradelli studio set with this pair is almost as good as the present recording -- again, it mostly comes down to conducting, although we also have to give Decca the edge on sound design, too.  The raw sound of Molinari-Pradelli's set does not serve the leads well, and both of them sound a bit tired to me.  They are better live, but there one is forced to cope with some appalling ensemble work, shoddy conducting, and deafening audience noise.  I also rather like Karajan's idiosyncratic, slow reading of the score on DG, although I'm sure many others would disagree; Domingo and Hendricks do well (especially the latter), but hearing Ricciarelli struggle with the title role is deeply painful.  I'd say largely the same of the Levine DVD, although there Domingo is not in the best voice, and Eva Marton does not struggle with the notes, but instead tackles them with a deeply unattractive, un-Puccinian tone.  I have yet to hear Borkh and Del Monaco's version, but I hear that it is well-sung but poorly conducted, too.  If you really love the opera in spite of its dramaturgical flaws, as I do, you'll probably want all of these.  But there is no question that the present set is the reference recording: beautifully sung, luxuriantly cast, and conducted with a verve and coherent vision that is quite rare in this repertoire.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app and the site. Frequently recommend it to all my friends. Many are addicted to it also!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I was hesitant to watch another action super hero formula movie, but WOW!  Avengers was awesome!  The action was dazzling, the chemistry was dead-on and the humor was perfect!  They really knocked this movie out of the ball park.  I thought the writing was great and they really gave each character a chance to develop.  They also didn't just toss them together and hope for the best, they brought out the personalities of each hero, personalities that are so often glossed over by one liners and zingers.  Kudos to the director and writers for taking the time to tell the tale and doing the work to bring forth more then just action and shallow waters.

B001P3SA94|3.0|Cadillac Records tells the story of Chess Records, a Chicago studio that recorded blues greats Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Willie Dixon, Howlin' Wolf, Etta James and helped launch rock n' roll by recording Chuck Berry. Adrien Brody plays Leonard Chess and Jeffrey Wright gives a solid performance as the Mannish Boy himself, Muddy Waters. The movie shows the early success Chess had with blues records and then how they suffered when rock n' roll took over and the blues recordings stopped selling. The last third of the movie also touches on the British invasion with the Rolling Stones recording one of Muddy's songs at Chess studios and getting a hit record out of it while Muddy struggled to earn a living.<br /><br />Cadillac Records is a well done music movie. Its pace is even and the performances are good all around. The music is recreated by the actors who do a great job for non-singers (excluding Beyonce of course). Because it's a story that takes place over many years their isn't time for much character development so we never find out anything revealing about Leonard Chess or Muddy Waters although we do get a glimpse into the struggles of Little Walter and Etta James. The biggest failure of the movie is the attention to facts. There's no mention of Leonard Chess's brother Phil who co-founded Chess Records and Leonard and Etta James did not have a romantic relationship. There are other inaccuracies as well. If you can overlook these flaws I found Cadillac Records to be an enjoyable movie.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey is a classic work of fiction that is well presented but blends modern day American English with classic British Aristocrats style. I like the way Julian Fellowes writes and brings all classes together in this fascinating tale.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Well, I can't say That I am surprised after receiving this knife. It is pretty much what I expected, having watched several U tube video's which showed its strength, weight, durability, and excellent chopping ability. I think most of the reviewers had it right when they called this thing \\"bomb proof\\". The thing I would like to point out to those of you thinking of buying this knife, is that you can read over the description, and look at the numbers over the internet, but when you actually get the knife, only then do you realize the weight, and thickness of the blade. This thing is a BEAST of a knife. I watched a video with a guy doing a \\"tip test\\" to test its ability to bore holes through a board - He had set a thick board on a huge, flat boulder, and then he stabbed the board, prying the knife sideways, to bore out chunks of wood to test tip strength. About half way through the video, He completely missed the board and drove the Knife straight down into the bolder. I cringed as I watched him do this, picturing how I would feel if it was my knife that I had just destroyed the tip on. Then, to my amazement, after inspecting the tip, it wasn't damaged at all! To make matters worse, about 30 seconds later this guy missed a second time - by this time, I was like \\"dude, learn how to aim\\"! But, again, he checked the tip - and NO DAMAGE!! Crazy! A full grown man driving a knife into a thousand pound bolder, and it didn't even ruin the tip!. Anyway. Its a Juggernaut, as in, can't be stopped. ;) The handle was a bit big for my taste, and the finish on the blade was not perfect, but given the purpose of the knife, and its intended use, I'm not bothered by it that much. As other viewers have mentioned the sheath is Ok. Not great. Just ok. The knife is well worth 40 bucks. In a torture test, I would confidently put this thing up against any mass produced high end knife. Kbar, ontario rat blades, cold steal, doesn't matter. This thing is bomb proof. Nuff said.

B0089BSM70|5.0|I want to thank Rick Rosenthal for releasing the TV version.  That has always been my favorite version!  I will say Halloween II is the best one in the series.  It actaully explains more, and you can see the child side in Michael Myers.  The tv version also goes in sync with the comic books.  Laurie Strode \\"He won't die mama! He Won't go away!\\"  True red-neck vioce!  This movie is considered the red headed step child of the series.  It never gets Tv play, it's never part of a boxset, it's never part of a flash back in any of the sequals, Jamie Lee never talks about, and people never realized that there were versions of the movie.  Halloween III and V, and VI get more respect!(3 had nothing to do with Halloween, and 5&6 were god awful!)  I have watched it twice already! The documentury was was cool! Halloween II is really where it should have ended.  H20 was good, but there was so much more of a back story on Laurie Strode.  We needed to have flash backs of her hell.  H2o never explains why she faked her death, and how Jimmy really died. They also never mentioned Michael coming back after her again in after part II and H20.  How Dr. Loomis and Maryann Chambers hid her from Michael.<br />Part 8 should have had jamie lee unconsious in the hall with Michael missing.(having her dream that she cut off Michael's Head.) or you have them say that's how LL cool j put the ending in his book that he was writing.  He can say laurie cut his head off to sell more books. If we have 8, we should have had jamie lee the climax at the ending! Thank you once again Rick for releasing part II!

0756407125|5.0|I love to read.  I love to write.  And like many of you, I am passionate about the English language.  Of all of the authors that I have read in the past 5 years Mr. Rothfuss stands alone among them in his lyrical, poetic use of the language without detracting from either his storyline or his accessibility.  Thanks to the kindle apps ability to highlight and share passages, I have have been able to share bits of this beauty with all my friends with their gratitude.  This second book, not only expands the development of his characters, but makes them more fallible and human.  If you are looking for a book that has incredible potential for multiple reads look no farther!  My only wish is that Mr. Rothfuss would share his talent more often with us.
1936719010|5.0|Do The Work is one of the best books with common-sence reminders of making choices to succeed! It is very informative , basic and innovative information on the principles of success!<br />DO THE WORK. Highly recomended1
B00846REIS|3.0|The story is ok but there isn't much of a story line. It is mostly sex, and Gideon uses it to control Eva, which I didn't really care for. The language is crude at times. I don't know who wrote the reviews at that beginning of the book, but 50 Shades is way, way better. I couldn't put 50 down and couldn't wait to read the next two. I have read the second book and it does get a little better towards the end. Very disappointed.
B005PK553C|4.0|This is a \\"must see\\" for any horror lover!! I could not stop watching. Great acting, sad/tragic story line. Definitely worth it. Amazon's customer service is top notch, I own many Amazon digital videos and they are top quality. Only problem is I haven't figured out how to download the movies onto my iPad, so I can watch while not connected to the internet (hence the 4 star rating)
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book shows the willingness on a strong spirited person to survive despite their tragic circumstances. it is also a testamant   to the value of good experiences in early childhood.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|I finally watched the Avengers, and I don't really know what to say. Ruffalo was excellent as Banner/the Hulk (best Hulk so far), Evans really IS Captain America (I wasn't so sure with the first movie), I have accepted Hemsworth as Thor (and he did a fine job here), Downey Jr. (what can you say besides the fact that he was born to play Stark/Iron Man, don't think anyone else could pull it off and still have the movie magic seen here), I even think Jeremy Renner turned out to be a good casting choice for Hawkeye (get a costume on him, maybe not in the comic's purple, but with the horned mask). I was not thrilled with Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow (she looked bored or like she wished she was somewhere else), and though I usually like her, it didn't work in this situation. Cobie Smulders was a nice surprise and loved her as Agent Hill. The rest of the cast were fine (Sam Jackson is going to be Sam Jackson, and it's too late to bitch, he is cemented in the Nick Fury role), it was great to see Harry Dean Stanton discover Banner in a pile of Hulk induced rubble, and while some people have been negative, Tom Hiddleston is perfectly smarmy as Loki. Unfortunately, Gwyneth was looking a little rough this time around (sorry, but it's true) as compared to her Pepper Potts from the first Iron Man. Oh my Lord, she was absolutely stunning/radiant/perfect in that one!<br /><br />The biggest congratulations go to Joss Whedon, though. I've been a fan of all of his work since the first episode of Buffy my girlfriend made me watch back in 1998. Joss really gets his characters to interact well with each other emotionally, and his timing and snappy dialogue are always spot-on. There are still scenes from Buffy that I need Kleenex to get through, just one  example is Spike comforting Buffy after her mother dies (although he was coming to kill her, he sees her crying and sits down and asks her what's wrong, then pats her on the shoulder). I am glad Joss is signed on for the second Avengers movie, because he really pulled off a difficult task in this one. Unlike the X-Men or Fantastic Four (sorry for even mentioning Reid Richards & Co.), who all lived in the same place and/or had commonalities as either mutants or people bombarded by galactic radiation, the Avengers is a motley group of completely different superheroes from different times, dimensions, backgrounds, etc. I wasn't sure how Whedon would do with the massive action scenes because he always had to do things on such a small scale and budget before this, but my worries were unfounded as the action was very well done. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable film.<br /><br />Some superhero movies have really become quite good since Sam Raimi raised the bar with the first two Spider-Man outings. They, along with X-Men: First Class, DC Comics' Dark Knight trilogy, and this, The Avengers, have all been wonderful. Love feeling like a kid again when I watch a movie! Marvel Studios, I have a whole pile of suggestions for new adaptations that don't involve Ben Affleck or Daredevil..
0792164903|5.0|This was a great movie, I loved it the first time I saw it and it's an awesome addition to my home film library!!
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|Manning another successful effort on the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; franchise, Chris Columbus' direction,  Roger Pratt's cinematography, and Steve Kloves' screenplay  combine to provide viewers with masterful onscreen storytelling.   The second outing for Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe) begins with the mysterious appearance of a house elf who speaks mostly in the third person named Dobby(Toby Jones)warning Harry that he will be in danger if he returns to Hogwarts. Shortly thereafter, Dobby sabotages a dinner Harry's aunt and uncle(Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw) were having with a prospective client, and Harry is framed for the disaster.  Despite Vernon Dursley's efforts to prevent Harry's return to Hogwarts, Harry is rescued by Ron Weasley's(Rupert Grint)brothers, twins Fred and George, as well as Percy(James and Oliver Platt, and Chris Rankin)in a magical car.  He spend that time before returning to school at the Weasley's home, The Burrow, where he meets the youngest Weasley, Ginny(Bonnie Wright), who is about to begin school at Hogwarts, a shy girl with a crush on Harry, whom he only glimpsed en route to the train the first year.Mrs. Weasley(Julie Walters) introduces Harry to floo powder as a means of magical transportation. But when he mispronounces  the name of his destination while using it, he ends up in the seedy Nocturn Alley instead of Diagon Alley where he witnesses a shady business deal by Lucius Malfoy(a cooly sinister Jason Isaacs) with his son, Draco(Tom Felton) in tow before being rescued by Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane).  In Diagon Alley everyone attends a book signing by Hogwarts' new, and vainglorious Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Gilderoy Lockhart(played to the hilt by Kenneth Branaugh), who is promoting his book, &#34;Magical Me&#34;. He seizes Harry to pose with him, knowing that such a photo op will rate the cover of &#34;Wizard Weekly&#34; magazine.An admiring Hermione(a maturing Emma Watson,looking a little less like the walking bisque dollshe was in the first film)is in the bookstore with her parents. Lucius Malfoy has a condescending confronation with the Weasleys there.Arthur Weasley(Mark Williams) prevents the confrontation from becoming too unpleasant.  As Harry and Ron find themselves unable to travel through Platform 9 3/4, they fly the magical car to Hogwarts at the risk of being seen by Muggles, and amid an encounter with the Whomping Willow. Scolded by Snape(Alan Rickman), they are placed in detention by Professor McGonagall(Maggie Smith), and an irate Molly Weasley sends her youngest son a howler to let him know where the lines are drawn. If such devices are ever used by Muggles, the world will soon be full of half-deaf schoolchildren!  Another annoyance for Harry is the overly enthusiastic First Year student, Colin Creevey(Hugh Mitchell), a photojournalist who constantly follows Harry around with his camera.  The year gets underway with lessons in Herbology by Professor Sprout(Miriam Margoyles) in handling screaming mandrakes and their juice, and another Quidditch match.  But the year will soon be darkened by the mysterious petrification of the caretaker, Filch's(David Bradley) cat, and several students, which keeps that hands of Madame Pomfrey(Gemma Jones) full in the infirmary,the 50-year-old mystery of a student's death, which Harry views in a memory featuring Dumbledore(Richard Harris in his final outing as that character), a young Hagrid(Martin Bayfield),and one young student named Tom Riddle(Christian Coulson), and who the Heir of Slytherin was. Harry's abilities with Parseltongue make students eye him suspiciously after a class discussion on the topic.It is of some significance that Dumbledore introduces Harry to his pet phoenix, Fawkes during a conference.  Using Polyjuice potion and the hairs of Draco's two closest cohorts, Harry and Ron transform themselves to interrogate Draco to find out if he is the heir of Slytherin. Hermione's efforts there go awry.  After Hermione herself is petrified,and Hagrid unjustly incarcerated, Harry and  the arachnaphobic Ron search for clues about the Chamber of Secrets by going into the Forbidden Forest, where they have a frightful encounter with the oversized spider, Aragog(Julian Glover). The ghost Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson) also provides them with clues, as do Hermione's notes.  Ultimately, as he, Ron and the ineffective Lockhart go down to the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is in for another encounter with Voldemort and will have to use his cunning to win the day once again.Young Ginny Weasley will have reason to find her schoolgirl crush on Harry to be well-placed.  All will end happily for those who deserve such an end. Especially given his own experience with abusive servitude, the ever-considerate Harry repays Dobby for his kindness, putting the elf's master in his place.The running joke about Hogwarts' inability to maintain a Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher for very long is never more comical as it is at this juncture!  It has been another year of growth and development for the musketeers with wands.Like the best of any group of friends, they play to each other's strengths, compensate for each other's weaknesses, and have an alliance of honest love, affection, and humor, and especially due to their youth and impishness, are always amusing to watch, even in the darkest moments.  As what will be an eventual journey of blood, sweat, and tears for Hogwarts main troublemakers and troubleshooters begins in earnest, we feel can always feel confident that the best will always happen for them.

I have read Catching Fire and Mocking Jay. They are both really good books to, but if i wouldnt of read this book i would have never even glanced at the others. If you are into things that will keep you on your feet and wanting to read more, this is definitly the book for you. They have made a movie , but i think the book is better. Want to find out which one is better? Than buy this book it is the best book of all time!It has some romance but its because they are fighting for their life in the arena. It helps you have a bigger imagination to because it has so many thoughts and so many things to think about. You just imagine the things and than go see the movie and it was totally different from what i thought the people would look like. Onve you read this book you should also read Catching Fire and Mocking Jay because those are the books that keep you wanting more and more!

B006ATJXQW|5.0|The beginning of the book start with before Thomas is sent into the Glade. Teresa was the narrator of this part. After reading the Death Cure, I absolutely hated her. But after reading her feelings about him going earned her a shred of the respect I had for her character.<br /><br />The second part of the book was a story of 13 years earlier. This was a year after the devastating sun flares. The world is in great desperation. The story is about Mark and his friends. They were in their village in the mountains when all of a sudden a hovercraft comes swarming down. 5 armed people in mysterious green suits and wearing oxygen masks come out bearing guns. The people were gazed some thinking they were being rescued. They were wrong. The 5 figures start shooting darts, causing the villagers to instantly fall to the ground. Mark, his friends Alec, Trina, the Toad, Lana, and another person get out safely.<br /><br />Alec had secretly had a gun and another tool. Using their things they killed 4 of the mysterious people and were on the hovercraft. One of them got away. When Mark and Alec explored they got to the pilot's room. A man attacked Mark and he was hurt. At the same time the hovercraft crashed. Mark awoke from his slumber and saw Alec. They went into the rubbage that was the Hovercraft and found a workpad. They then set off to their village not knowing what they will find.<br /><br />When they get back they smell dead bodies. They find out sickness was going around and they know it was from the darts. One of their friends lasted from the darts. But the pain in his head was unbearable to him and he killed himself. Mark and his friends start to pack to leave the village. But the person who's name I can't remember has a headache. The friends run out of the room. She tells them to leave and not to worry through the door. The Toad, who was always close to her tells her he is staying with her. The friends leave with despair stuck in their heads. They move some distance awayand make camp. Before going to sleep they are interrupted by a visitor. It is the Toad. He is hysterical. He says he is sick and that she died. Alec takes the Toad away and kills him. He comes back to group saying nothing. I don't want to ruin anymore of the story. What happens next? You'll just have to read to find out.<br /><br />This book was absolutely wonderful. It is certainly worth buying! It really gave the background on how it felt to go through the sun flares and the desperation that followed it. I recommend this book to anyone who loves action, romance, and a little mystery. You need to read it especially if you read the Maze Runner Series. I am crazy about this series. Out of the (literally)hundreds of books I have read, this series is the BEST to me. I love James Dashner's way of describing and assorting his words so thoroughly and correctly that you can practically imagine exactly the mood and look of the scene. I can barely put the books down. I absolutely CAN NOT wait until the next one!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|It's perfect. I just want to give it 5 stars, but Amazon doesn't think that that's good enough of a review.  So, I am writing about that fact instead of further talking about the game.  I hope this satisfies those at Amazon.

I'll be ordering more.  I'm excited.  My daughter absolutely LOVES them too :)

Roll on the next one.

0465043550|5.0|[[ASIN:B00076F0KC The Misbehavior of Markets]]<br /><br />This is an outstanding book in financial literature. I read it after reading Taleb's Black Swan. Naturally, Professor Mandelbrot has a point arguing that financial markets do not behave normally (nowadays everyone immerse in financial markets should be aware about this!). You bet! It only takes to turn back and remember october 1987 to realize the fact. I would recommend this book to any person who is curious about the developments that Mandelbrot and his disciples have made in fractal geometry applied to economics and finance. Also, if you are a technical reader, this book could help you as a warm up to more sofisticated books on the topic. READ IT!

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I have to say that like a few other reviewers I was fully entrenched in this very real, very touching story of a American Hero and hated knowing which direction this was going to end. This is who our Children should be looking up to, not some overpaid whining sports figure or politician. I will likely read this again to really take it in. Bravo Zulu to the Author, I know he took great pains to insure that he captured the true essence of this Man's life.

I love Rocky, he is an idol of insperation.  No matter how much he gets beat he still comes back and gets even or wins.  The loss of Adrian was a bummer, that made it hard for him.  I loved the movie, It was more three Demensional than the last 2 Rockys.  Good job sly.

B008O69SZ0|4.0|One of rock's most prolific songwriters and singers is back. It's a mixture of rocking songs and ballads. Even though Ian is now 70+ he can still perform better than all these Idol wannabes! The title track is the best track here and is pure pop. I would've given it 5 stars but it doesn't quite hold up to his previous CD, which included a song about the \\"Girl in the Office\\" everyone wanted to date- \\"Man Overboard.\\"
B009JBZH54|5.0|Three epic Batman movies (5 discs total) for pretty much the price of a single blu-ray movie. It's a no brainer. Almost bought the first two as a bundle which came out to a cheap $25 (or so I thought). Once Dark Knight Rises comes out on blu-ray it will be $25 alone. $50 vs $30 (plus bonus content). Hmmmm? Of all movies that have come out or about to come out soon (Avengers 3D, Titanic 3D, Prometheus etc.) this is the best deal of them ALL on Amazon. I'm glad I held off on buying that two disc combo pack of the first two movies. Buy this. Buy this right now.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This was an ok read. It was interesting enough to keep you reading but the characters weren't that believable. And the plot has lots of flaws. At moments the book felt like it was happening in high school instead of college. It was just superficial in the sense that you don't get to really know what Abby is feeling or whats actually going through her head, she is just stating facts not telling a story. Something that to me was incredibly unbelievable is the fact that she was still sexually inexperienced in spite of the fact of her background and where she came from. The book was still mildly entertaining, so if you are bored and don't have anything better to do go ahead and read it.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|They did a good job of keeping the movie serious yet bringing in some of the comic book humor- I wished I had caught it in theaters, but it still is good on the home theater. I think they did a good job of keeping the gore down for kids, although I wouldn't recommend for some of the younger aged kids simply due to violent nature (it is a war after all ;-) and 'scary' aspects, which I thought were great.<br /><br />Hard not to like the Hulk & the crew going mad dog on those metallic space 'eels' or whatever they were :-)
B007RP4D5Y|2.0|Call me closed- minded if you must......but i have NEVER heard anything from Metheny that was worth a second listen unless Lyle Mays was playing with him.  Sorry...just my opinion.
B000001EUL|5.0|Every song on this album is a gem especially the heavier tracks. Loving You Sunday Morning reminds us, why going to church is stupid. Another Piece of Meat is the homage to sex organs that you'd wished you'd composed. Always Somewhere is the love letter to all groupies past & present. Coast to Coast is a transcontinental romp of Liebenstraum. Can't Get Enough is high altitude, high speed, German engineering at its finest. Is There Anybody There is the cry of the Fatherland. Lovedrive again kicks your ass into submission. Holiday finishes off the set with a great pickup line to use on chicks. The trifecta of Schenker, Schenker und Jabs ist on par with Lynyrd Skynyrd's three guitar challenge. Rarebell und Buchholz hold down their rhythm section despite repeated allied attacks. And Klaus is ubersexual & verboten as lead singer. Ten stars for Deutscheland's rarest exports of glistening popular metal.
0060873027|4.0|Michael Crichton has been my favorite author for as long as I've enjoyed reading. I've always enjoyed the anticipation of a forthcoming Crichton book and the excitement of picking up that book and beginning to read it. I'm sad that I will not have that experience again, but I'm happy with the catalog that Michael Crichton has left behind.<br /><br />That being said, I was naturally somewhat skeptical of Micro upon picking it up. The book, along with its predecessor Pirate Latitudes, was found partially completed on Crichton's hard drive after his death. While Pirate Latitudes was for the most part finished, and able to be released with minor touching up (feel free to check out my review of Pirate Latitudes), Micro was very much incomplete. Crichton had written approximately a third of the book, and author Richard Preston was hired by the publisher to complete the book according to Crichton's outline and notes. I was not familiar with Preston's works, so I wasn't sure about how the finished product would turn out. However I needed one last Crichton fix, so I purchased the book and eagerly started reading.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with Micro. Clearly the book is not among the best works of Michael Crichton, but it certainly fits in well with the rest of his catalog. The book was an easy read, and very entertaining. The book contained enough research to make the plot of shrinking living things and inanimate objects seem plausible, but not enough to bore the reader with details. The story itself had a Jurassic Park feel to it; it was definitely a lot of fun to read, and I enjoyed picturing myself in the environment that was described in the book. The book also feels cohesive, not like it was written by two authors. I was not able to tell where Crichton ended and where Preston began.<br /><br />Praise aside, the book does have its drawbacks as well, mainly centering around the characters. The characters in the book were not very believable, but were rather more like stereotypes of personality traits. The dialog between them was equally poor. If the book were made into a movie, I was unfortunately imagining a cast of bad actors (think Hayden Christensen as Rick and Kristen Stewart as Karen). That being said, the story was entertaining enough to distract from the poor characters and dialog.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of Michael Crichton's previous work, I think you'll enjoy this book. If you're like me and Crichton is your favorite, or among your favorite authors, then this book is a must have. It certainly will not stand out in his catalog, but it is also certainly not the worst Michael Crichton book (I would say Next claims that title). Micro has also made me interested in Richard Preston's writing, and I intend on picking up some of his books soon. I can see Micro turning into a fun movie as well... that is... as long as they don't use my idea for a cast.<br /><br />-KCe stereotypes of personality traits.

B005EGXTL2|5.0|One of my top 3 favourite book series. There is a reason why this has become so popular, and why they're making this trilogy in to a movie series.<br />If you're like me, you might need to go back and read this book again to pick up on the minor details.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|Unfortunately as a product I didn't get to experience it, it was DOA right out of the box, both USB and outlet power didn't work.  The other BIG negative is it comes with a VERY SHORT USB/Power cable.  Since it's not recommended to plug into front USB ports, plugging it in the back almost takes all the cord leaving it very difficult to place to make a good working area.<br /><br />I selected this model based on reviews and I was surely let down.
B003DZX3US|5.0|This purchase was more an impulse buy, but I do not regret it at all.  I loved this film as a child, and I love it just as much as an adult. Abso-freaking-lutely brilliant.<br /><br />Buy it while you still can.
B006CEYM3Y|5.0|Fun game for adults. maybe age 20+... not sure the theme would go with the teens. first time we got the game we played it 4x in 2 days... my husband loved it. and we played it with some friends on our game night and they enjoyed it too.<br />It's a fun semi-euro style game with a mix of some great mechanics. of course i liked the mancala mechanic to it... something different. lots of variety. more than one way to win the game and so many victory points to accumulate. its almost like a race, and in the end, you may be surprised that the person who seems to be the loser of the game can actually be the winner after all victory points are counted at the final round.
B008220CC4|5.0|Sinister is one of those movies that you just know you have to see because the buzz around it is so darn huge. Usually, movies with massive buzz turn out to be duds, yet Sinister skillfully avoids this accursed fate, I'm happy to say! It stars my favorite actor Ethan Hawke, who, I'm happy to realize, has fathered children with his former nanny, a true, touching love fest to be sure!<br /><br />The plot of Sinister revolves around Hawke's character who is a true-crime fanboy, which means that he is really a superfan of serial killers, and he makes his living by purchasing serial killer memorabilia (such as Chuck Manson's sweet-a/s/s guitar and Scott Peterson's hands that strangled Lacey!). Ewww, eerie, right? I know! Anyhoo, to purchase this memorabilia, he has a lot of traveling to do, which is why he very benevolently moves his family around from new city to new city, uprooting his kids wherever he goes. However, Hawke finally settles in an old house (oh, you know that it just will turn out to be an Amityville Horror house of some kind *rolls eyes*), yet he discovers a treasure trove of old, VHS movies that really gets the plot moving into full-steam.<br /><br />It turns out that there was a family of liberals who was actually murdered in his new house! The old, VHS movies are actually old recordings this ultra-crazy family of Texas Chainsaw Massacre-like libs made before they were murdered. As the story progresses, we see with increasing horror how this family of slain libs actually recorded all of their debauched acts, such as promoting voting without any checks for IDs at voting booths, handing taxpayer money over to green-energy companies like Solyndra, and, worst of all, taking turns defecating on the U.S. flag! Horrid, I know!<br /><br />Watching all of these old, VHS movies unleashes a horribly malevolent, supernatural entity in Hawke's new house, and his family is immediately under threat. This diabolical entity begins to do all sorts of noxious things, such as p/e/e on the family's American flag, banish crosses all over the home and even set all TVs in the house to MSNBC. After a while, poor Hawke and his family become crazy, with Hawke finally snapping and killing his wife and his little, crippled, undergrown 8-year-old boy, in what the authorities later suspect was a \\"roid rage\\" killing. Shockingly, we the audience find out in the epilogue that the only thing wrong with the house was that it had some asbestos in the walls that was leaking out and causing this craziness. In other words, the Hawke character killed his family and his crippled, 8-year-old, retarded son for nothing!<br /><br />Honestly, I had mixed emotions about the stunning ending because it played on my emotions rather cruelly, especially because my emotions are still raw from all those newspaper accounts of whole families being murdered that I always read. Nonetheless, I will still buy Sinister on video tape when it is finally released, mainly because Ethan Hawke can do no wrong, as he proved in his greatest role ever, White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf.h as p/e/e on the family's American flag, banish crosses all over the home and even set all TVs in the house to MSNBC.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Smoking hot love sceans, deep story line and lots of twists and turns (in and out of the bed:). Can't wait to see what happens next!!
0345803485|1.0|I tried. I honestly, truly did.  After about page 13, I was about to give up, but thought maybe it will improve!  OMG!  It only got worse from there!  I am seriously not going to even bore you with the details, other than the characters are flat (and I am not actually sure what they even LOOK like really, I did eventually make it to page 80...props for that!), there are repeats of the same wording over and over, no little details that let the reader see with their own imaginations, and don't even get me started on the sex....it is laughable!  I hate giving a bad review, but after all the hype, I am beyond disappointed.  My fifth graders (maybe my fourth) could read this book.  If your tastes are a bit (lot) more sophisticated, I recommend Karen Moning (Highlander and Fever Series).  She is detailed and her characters are rich, along with a plot (oh yes!  a plot!) that twists and turns and has you guessing at every chapter.  I am just glad I checked this book out at the library and did not spend money on it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am not one to join in on all the hype, however I loved The Hunger Game trilogy. I highly recommend it!
B005S9ELQ2|5.0|Argo, not to be confused with Fargo or with Esso, the gas station, is one hell of a timely as hell movie. If you do not understand what the word timely means, it is defined by the Free Dictionary as \\"something that occurs or happens to occur in a relevant period of time.\\" That describes Argo to a tee because we Americans just experienced the national tragedy known as the Death of Ambassador Christopher Stevens (who might have been g/a/y, too) because Obama and Hillary Clinton were too busy ignoring the requests of the U.S. embassy in Libya for added security. That certainly explains why everyone in the Obama administration first tried to insult the intelligence of all Americans by getting everyone to believe that a harmless, little YouTube video was behind the terrorism! Needless to say, everyone in the Obama administration now looks like a bunch of lying liars who told a bunch of...lies as they laughably try to walk back their original blame of the YouTube video.<br /><br />In this context, Ben Affleck's--who's greatest movie role was Daredevil, by far--Argo is unbelievably...timely! It's like Gigli himself somehow saw the future and made a movie about current events...before they happened.<br /><br />In Argo, the plot revolves around the Iranian revolution exploding, and how a CIA specialist comes up with a daring plot to liberate some Americans who have been hiding at the bachelor pad of the Canadian ambassador. Excuse me, now: At this point, I have to leave to get up to go to the bathroom. I will be back in about 20 minutes. (20 minutes later). Okay, I'm back. I'm awfully sorry, but I had a lot of Fresca to drink a while ago.<br /><br />It's clear what Ben Affleck's point with Argo is. He is clearly saying that all Americans should pretend to be Canadians if they are traveling abroad, especially in Iran, just like when the Iraq War was going on and Dubya was in office. See, Affleck's point is that even though Canadians look, act and sound just like Americans (except for their mispronunciation of words like \\"out\\" and \\"about\\"), the whole world loves them because they are very dull people who secretly hate all Americans. In Affleck's film, this theme is brought to the forefront when the \\"evil\\" Americans are persecuted by the Islamonazi Iranians and take refuge in the apartment of the canuck ambassador. The movie, in my humble opinion, takes an outlandish turn when the Americans are secretly smuggled out of Iran by hiding in maple syrup jars that Iran happened to be exporting to North Korea.<br /><br />Still, this movie was very riveting and highly intelligent. I can't believe that Ben Affleck is such a mature filmmaker now, especially when he was such a massive box-office star with his monster hits like Gigli and Daredevil just a few years back! Oh well, if he is now able to produce such sharply insightful films like this--where the main message is how Canadians are loved by the whole world for nothing more than hating Americans while failing to produce anything of significance in their whole country's history--then I want to nominate Ben for best director at next year's Tonys.cept for their mispronunciation of words like \\"out\\" and \\"about\\"), the whole world loves them because they are very dull people who secretly hate all Americans.

B009CPIR9K|5.0|...keeping in mind I rate stuff on Amazon based solely on whether it was a good purchase - because this is a place where you buy stuff...<br /><br />Starting from the assumption that you already know this is a movie featuring Nazis invading the Earth from the Moon in flying saucers, assuming that you've committed to this concept... I don't see how you could dislike or regret seeing this B movie.  I really cannot even imagine it any more than I can imagine someone liking the general idea and tropes of Army of Darkness and then disliking it after seeing it.  If you're not sure about movies about Nazis in flying saucers on the Moon or if sardonic humor confuses or bothers you... then of course, approach with caution.<br /><br />The movie even has a pretty well done feel and style to it - the Nazis have a steampunk/fallout sensibility to them for instance.  The acting was totally appropriate to what it was.  It didn't feel like there were any sections that dragged or anything... really, for what it is, it is a total success.  Is this my favorite movie because I'm giving it 5 stars?  Nope.  I wouldn't put it up against Citizen Kane or anything, but as Dr Strangelove crossed with only the entertaining parts of Independence Day, it totally entertained me.  It gets 5 stars because I got exactly what I thought/hoped I was purchasing.<br /><br />This is the sort of film that I wouldn't do the ol aw cmon speech if someone else is reluctant to see it the way I might with other films.  (Admittedly there ARE films like that.  I'd gladly insist a reluctant person watch the Merchant Ivory production of Room With a View for instance... because if they couldn't appreciate it, they'd be totally numb to good cinematography, romance, or humor)  If your prospective co-watcher doesn't chortle at the very concept if not the trailer of Iron Sky, watch it yourself and let it be a guilty pleasure.  Enjoy!

B005LAIHY0|3.0|Eerily similar to Alien in storyline, right down to the concept art of H.R. Giger, Weyland-Utani \\"Building Better Worlds\\" corporation, and the evil synthetic droid who sabotoges the mission.  The alien egg pods have been replaced with weeping vessels of alien goo, but basically, this is a prequel to Alien.

I especially like that it can be played in small segments a few minutes at a time.  Fun!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan since I was a teenager and purchased 'salem's Lot, not having any idea what it was about, and just being scared out of my mind reading it (and loving it).<br /><br />There are tons of reviews on this book and I don't really have anything different to add.  This book was just so good.  It was about so much more than trying to change history with time travel.  It is a love story.  A love story with a time period that is so nostalgic, a time when big changes were just around the corner and not just the assasination.  It is a love story between and man and woman as well.<br /><br />The writing is just so rich and wonderful.  This is a big book which was daunting for me having read a few of those from King in the past, but I promise it is a quick read.  It is so good you just do not want to stop. A lot of King's books, especially some of the overly long ones, seemed to peter out and the ending was always just so so.  This one ends perfectly in my opinion.<br /><br />If you've been a King fan, then I just can't imagine you not liking this book.

B008IZYWXU|5.0|Since the earlier review of this was so thorough, I will be uncharacteristically brief and not go into a lot of detail in my comments.  This is a terrific 4-disc set and a \\"must\\" for fans of either Freddie or Montserrat or both.  It was through YouTube that I first learned about the original \\"Barcelona\\" album and that was what introduced me to Montserrat Caballe.  I was immediately intrigued, and now, some time later, I am a besotted fan and have thoroughly enjoyed listening to her in performances of opera arias, art songs, lieder.....  It was a stroke of genius on Freddie Mercury's part and on Montserrat Caballe's part to collaborate on the \\"Barcelona\\" album and the unique pieces created for it.  The two of them obviously enjoyed this project and it shows, both in their singing and in their performances on the videos.<br /><br />I thought the original album was wonderful.  This new version, with the full orchestration, by far outshines it.  As someone said, this is the way Freddie probably envisioned it in the first place and I am sure that he would love this beautifully done interpretation of his original concept.  Brilliantly conceived and executed, this really showcases the two singers and the music.  I am very happy that this 25th-anniversary project was undertaken and has come to such terrific fruition.  This collection of 4 discs is one to be enjoyed, time and time again.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|The topic of this novel is unsettling. The idea of defending your child against murder charges is frightening. The potential that your child is a murderer is terrifying. Landay's story about the impact of the accusations against Jacob on his family is very good. However, the ending and some of the plot twists were too predictable and too Hollywood.

B008OJ291W|3.0|Very curious why Jeff would go to such trouble as to re-record these classics.  Does strike me at first as being a tad selfish.  Although he does a fine job with the music, I remain more impressed with the originals.  ELO was a band, although Jeff certainly was the dominant leader.  However other great musicians were behind him - Bev, Mik, Kelly, etc.  I miss them on there - especially Kelly.  For the casual fan this will suffice just fine, but as a die-hard, most of this was unnecessary.  I will admit to being very impressed with the remake  of 10538 Orchestra - a song begging for another shot...and Jeff delivers in fine form.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I've never read a Harry Potter book but, of course, knew of this author's extraordinary fame.  Therefore, I was anxious to read her first book written specifically for adults.  Also, I am a great fan of those who write of life in small English villages.  But be forewarned:  this is not the quaint and cozy village as found in works by Rosamunde Pilcher or Maeve Binchy.  This is a dark and seamy tale that explores the worst of rural life, the not-so-neighborly residents who wouldn't lend a hand if their life depended on it.<br /><br />That being said, this was enjoyable enough.  There were many well-defined characters and the story moved along well because the author is very good at her craft.  She knows how to tell a story, although I wish she could have done it with the omission of the profanity which was so heavily used it was distracting.  Also repugnant was the way the adults, two characters in particular,  treated their children.  With parents like those in the village of Pagford, there is very little hope for the next generation.<br /><br />The story centers on the death of the man everybody liked, Barry Fairbrother.  When he dies in the opening pages, the rest of the village is left to carry on recalling his virtues, remembering his failings.  There are numerous characters, and the sheer number of them is overwhelming at first.  However, as the story moves along each does become well-defined in his or her own right, and by mid-novel the reader has a good picture of this village which will never make England's list of top ten places tourists should visit.  Neighbors hate neighbors, children hate parents, spouses hate each other----it's a veritable hell on earth.  Bookended by tragic deaths, the author explores those who think they are at the top of the social ladder and those who have no hope of pulling themselves out of the quagmire they were born into.

B002RI9XOW|3.0|I've never been a fan of Woody Allen and this novel reminded me of his self absorbed myopic nature to be honest. Nicks's got some good humour and introspection that I can relate to but not enough of it to really nail my interest. It just got a bit tedious for me and I was looking for the end of the book the further I got into it. It may have appealed more to the musos amongst us and perhaps  that's why I skipped over these rants ...

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was very reluctant to read this series, I thought being a young adult novel would make the story very toned down and a lot like a twilight book, but after a friend repeatedly recommended it to me I gave it a shot.<br /> I thought the character of Katniss Everdeen was a great character very strong and indepedent young lady and I think she is a good role model for teenage girls who might find this book interesting and the love triangle between her Peeta and Gale was very well done and it keeps you guessing how this will all wrap up in the end.<br /> The series in a whole is very enjoyable though the second one was my favorite. The series was a quick read.
B0087HT36U|3.0|I like it more than angry birds because you can be more precise with you shots but the start updelay on the kindle fire ruins a couple of levels and sometimes the supports will beak and disappear but still hold up the building.
B008XG1X18|5.0|oh my goodness! I am officially addicted to this and its so nice! everything works good and I haven't had any complications! I get so many ideas from here!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Fast-paced, entertaining, and thought-provoking. It manages to be traditional military science fiction, but with some serious thoughts about aging and politics. My only complaint was that it was a little too much like Robert Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers.\\" I understand it is supposed to be an homage to that novel, but the story arc was a little too close in my opinion.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If I've learned anything from reading this series its don't get attached to any of the characters. This book the third in the series is the bloodiest one so far. This series has the biggest cast of characters in any book that I've read before and it could get hard to keep track of who is who and what is the characters relationship to other characters. The fact that the author writes every chapter from the point of view of a diffrent character helps out.<br /> I've lost a lot of sleep reading this book it was just that good, the plot twist kept me up for many a nights reading to find out what happens next. I pride myself on being a person who can pretty much guess whats going to happen next or I can basiclly figure out the end of a book half way through but I've given up trying to guess and figure out what is going on. I just sit back and enjoy the tale that this author is weaving and I can't wait to jump into the fourth book.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|One of the most enjoyable films that I've seen in quite awhile. Kept my attention. I didn't fall asleep with this one. I didn't read the books so I had no idea how the movie would end. I'd call it bittersweet.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|War is ugly  and this story could just as easily be placed in Afganistan . The love scenes between Robert and Maria were very moving.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Season 2 of Boardwalk Empire was even more explosive than Season 1! It was a cliffhanger with unexpected twists and shocking scenes! This HBO series rivals The Sopranos for no-holds-barred sheer grit and unchained reality! I recommend it to anyone who likes historically based series with excellent actors. If you liked The Sopranos and Deadwood, you will LOVE Boardwalk Empire!
0307720950|5.0|This book was fantastic and I highly recommend it. I just kept feeling this thrilling rush of possibility and wow because the story of the next industrial revolution was that good and it was told that well.<br /><br />The key point is not that the current manufacturing industry will be swept away any time soon, but rather that there will be exponentially more opportunities for smaller manufacturers and related businesses and individuals.<br /><br />The first part of the book puts the maker trend in context in terms of business and social history. I promise this is a lot more interesting than I just made it sound. The second part is more detailed about specific manifestations and is full of real examples of companies that are making viable businesses based on the developing possibilities.<br /><br />If you deal with physical stuff, whether in manufacturing or retail or something in between, then read the book. I believe he will convince you that this is a trend worth paying attention to. If he doesn't, well, there's some great stories of people doing interesting things to keep you entertained. And if he does, then he gives you an informative grounding from which you can think about how the turmoil and change from the new social structures of the web extending ever more into the physical world will affect your industry and future.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Fantastic album. Some songs were a little to similar to the last album for my taste, but was still incredible. Mumford and Sons are my favorite band.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Don't bother.  I heard all the hype and was interested.  I read the whole book but it did not leave me wanting more.  I had no respect for the main characters
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Yes,I must begin by saying that,I am too,one of those 'number one fans' going back to late '76.<br /><br />  I detested SB, am offended by fake-Ace and fake-Pete. Am sorry, these are not characters, these were identities.<br />  Yes I know that Lon Chaney didn't play the phantom of the opera in the 90's...so i DO get how Gene would like to see a KISS<br />version touring in 2075...<br /><br />  If this is the final album with any original members,it's a fine finish.(i thought they were done after Crazy Nights!)<br />)<br />  Monster only fails to get 5 stars 'cuz' the production is relatively poor.  Paul produced Animalize,and that big fat sound is not here.What we get is that compressed mp3 telephone-quality sound...same thing with the new Van Halen,same with Rush' ClockworkAngels, (possibly their best ever,rendered unlistenable by the producer.)<br /><br />I know it's not just me, blogs are full of comments from older folk like me(!)who long for a return to quality recording...as in W2MN by Alice Cooper and Bob Ezrin.<br /><br /> I wonder what The Wall by Floyd would sound like if it was made today...hmm,get a friend to play it for you over the phone,and you'll hear that tinny, compressed, no-air,no room for the instruments to breath sound that I'm referring to.<br /><br />  Monster ISN'T that awful, but much of the drums sound buried in the mix, and I feel the bottom end suffers with 'mud',again similarly to Halens' ADKOT. While it does elicit a slight nostalgic feeling for an older cassette with the highs worn out,heh, the lower frequencies seem to cut off at around 80 hertz,as I needed a subwoofer just to get a comfortable fullness.<br /> No it's not my stereo: I listened to Moving Pictures right after Clockwork Angels,then I checked out Revenge, and those albums retain that wonderful fullness that I,for a moment on these 2012 releases, thought was the fault of my old ears!<br /><br />  As for the music itself: Best KISS since Revenge or Creatures! Fake-Ace, while still forced to dress like a previous member (can you imagine Deep Purple dressing new guitarists up like Blackmore...!)<br />now is allowed to sound more like himself, and it helps! I have listened to this cd 5 times so far and haven't had to skip a track yet, unlike SB where every song had a solo lifted from Frehley, but without the tone or the feel.<br /><br />  I feel for Singer,though. Remember KISS extreme closeup from '92 where he spoke about makeup for himself, he wasn't looking forward to dressing up as cat 2.<br /><br />  I would really love kiss to release two versions of Monster,one with makeup,one without.  Stoopid fans will buy both, and I can buy the one without! BTW, Frehleys' Anomaly was superior to SB, and while Monster is the best kiss in decades, can you imagine this cd with Ace? Would be best ever.<br /><br />  KISS would say there would be no new music if Ace was in the band today.  I reluctantly agree,yet am tinged with anger: KISS FINALLY makes a heavy album again...<br />meaning that FINALLY,<br />(going all the way back to 1981,) they are FINALLY listening to what Ace wanted to do: make a heavy rock record. It succeeds. I am happy to be  fan again, but all happiness will be tempered by a refusal to buy any merchandise with fake images.<br /> (I wouldn't buy,for example, A t-shirt of THE WHO if any replacements for Entwistle were dressed up in his old clothes and a Boris the spider hanging around his neck...<br /><br />  Gene and Paul, as a long-suffering supporter, I thankya for this record,I like it,and I will be smiling...but...I am replacing the cd cover with an...ahem, unmasked version of 2012 KISS...if you come to town, play all or most of the new album live.I will go see you, if it is another retread of the 96' tour with the same damn songs ,forget it. I saw Ace in concert,small club here in vancouver, better set list, better sound, etc.<br /><br />  here's an idea for KISS: start the show with RARAN.  Alice starts his show with schools out,gets that big hit out of the way, makes the concert less predictable,and KISS live since 2000 has been ridiculously predictable.<br /><br />  PS.  going by history, only 14 more years til a new Frehley disc, Monster will keep you busy til then,heh!
B0099G4Y26|5.0|This was my first Pink purchase and it's awesome. The whole thing rocks and gets me moving. The songs are infectious and not in an annoying stuck-in-your-head way. Yes, there's a lot of swearing (I'm pretty sure \\"sh*t\\" is her favorite word), but so what? Like others have said, you're a little clueless if you don't expect that from Pink. Listen to it on your own if you're afraid of offending others - that just means you can rock out without embarrassing yourself. And if you yourself are offended, buy something else!

B005LAIHY0|3.0|Many of the fans of the original Alien film were disappointed with the film, and with good reason.<br /><br />The film, despite some great effects and reasonable acting from a couple of the actors, and a score that's fitting if unmemorable, is let down by the utterly atrocious writing and choppy editing. The plot is unnecessary and full of plot holes.<br /><br />So with all that in mind I tried to enjoy the film on it's own and no reference to the original, and was left still wanting. I just hope the inevitable Director's Cut will plug some of the holes, and tidy up the editing.  It won't improve the acting, nor can it help the ridiculous \\"genesis\\" plot.<br /><br />The Blueray pack comes on three disks. The 3D version is nice and subtle most of the time, so not too obtrusive. The Extras are a nice touch, but don't get your hopes up for an alternate beginning and ending. There are some extra scenes and alternative dialogue, but make little difference to the original version. For once I agree with the ending scene being cut, but the beginning, perhaps, better explains how things all started.<br /><br />But in truth I don't think the extras warrant the extra money, unless you are a completist and need the 3D version with the extras that you'll only want to watch once.<br /><br />If I was to buy again, I'd only buy the standard DVD copy.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|There were some laugh out loud moments, the characters were developed like I felt like I knew them my hole life. I thought it would be cliche with vampires and witches when reviews said it was like twilight but then instead it was original and I can't see why anyone compares it to twilight because the stories and characters are so different sometimes they are even opposite. It was easy to read enough to read it in 1 day I was reading it on my breaks at work and stayed up late reading it, my dog was wondering when he would be able to get my attention again!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A great fun read. I would laugh out loud on my morning commute while reading Bossypants! I felt as though a friend was telling me hilarious stories all throughout the read! Highly recommend if you're looking for a fun and upbeat read.

B000000WCX|4.0|I never heard this album until this year when I started reviewing Bowie's back catalogue. It's a good album and I've played it many times. The drum and bass aspect does sound a little dated, but the songs still flourish. The songs stand the test of time and that's the mark of a true genius who can create music this good well into his career.

B004H4XDBI|4.0|and I never cry from books!  Sad movies yeah, and maybe the occasional puppy commercial, but never from books.<br /><br />On a very basic level, this book is about dealing with a break-up. And this author accomplished something that I view as very difficult - she developed and explored the main characters' relationship in a way that didn't bring the words \\"teen drama\\" to mind.  Although Adam and Mia are 21 and 20 in this book, their relationship ended when they were both in their teens.  Normally, I would be viewing such a relationship rather lightly or even indulgently -- just young love right? Teenage love - we all go through it, we all get past it.  But there was a level of maturity in the characters' voices and in the situations themselves that made me completely buy in to their relationship as something serious and real and tragic.<br /><br />In looking back at it, okay, yes, there was some melodrama and perhaps a bit too much angst, but it didn't matter because as I was reading it, I never noticed it (too busy sobbing maybe?)<br /><br />Like the first book, this one was written with flashbacks interwoven throughout.  I absolutely love this writing style and felt that every flashback was placed perfectly and flowed well with the present story line.  Music also plays a big role in this book, and I especially loved the lyrics from Adam's songs that are shown in the beginning of the chapters.  You really get a sense of his pain and bitterness from those slices of lyrics.<br /><br />I haven't read too many books from a guy's point of view that are written by women - the few that I have read have totally sucked in large part due to the narrator's voice sounding like a female (Ethan in Beautiful Creatures comes to mind).  But I totally bought it here.  Adam felt like a guy, and his raw emotions came across as very genuine.

B005YVTHT0|5.0|The SR1-SW wheel that I bought for Simraceway is superb.  The quality is awesome.  Heavy duty built, knobs and switches work very well.  The wheel is intuitive and only took a minute or two to be recognized and for me to be playing.  Huge range of adjustments and all work well.  It is the perfect wheel for me as I have limited space and it is a handheld wheel.  I have owned other wheels but this is best for both quality and useability.
0060873175|4.0|In Hawaii, Rodriguez, a P.I. hired by Chinese lawyer Willy Fong, breaks into the offices of Nanigen, a reclusive new research company. Nanigen is shrouded in mystery. Fong wants to know what it is they do there. Upon breaking in Rodriguez is astonished to find no guards. Suddenly, he receives a cut on his forehead... apparently from nothing. Then another. And another. He flees Nanigen and drives to Fong's office. Fong and another Chinese man, apparently a client of his, are shocked when Rodriguez staggers in, slashed up and bloodied. Dying from bloodless, Rodriguez lives just long enough to witness the other two men begin to get sliced and diced in a similar manner...<br /><br />On the US mainland, a group of grad students are working in a secluded college laboratory. In short order we meet Peter, an expert on venomous reptiles, a kindly, bookish introvert, Karen, a specialist in spiders and a martial arts expert (!), Rick, a self-professed expert in tribal herbal remedies, Amar, an Indian student, Erika, a German student, and Jenny, a student who may or may not be of Asian descent, but is definitely a lesbian. The group's competitive research (why so many students of wildly different fields all work in the same lab is not gone into) is interrupted by the arrival of Peter's brother Eric and a man and a woman, the three driving up in Lamborghinis (!!!). The man is Vincent Drake, head of Nanigen, and the woman is Alyson Bender, who works for him, and they're here to offer the students jobs at the up and coming research center. They have various misgivings, but all eventually say yes. While snooping in one of the Lamborghinis, Peter absently picks up a pebble-looking thing and pockets it. After a chat with his brother, they depart.<br /><br />Then we meet Danny, who isn't a biological science expert of any sort but some kind of halfassed philosophy expert whose research is to prove there are no objective truths. No one else at the lab likes him, but he seems unaware ofthis. After learning about the Nanigen job offer, he essentially forces himself onto the group and they let him come for some reason. Examining the pebble doohicky he found in the car, Peter discovers it appears to be a tiny airplane. When he and Amar examine it under a microscope, they discover this is indeed the case! Everyone wonders how Nanigen can make a plane so small.<br /><br />Later, Peter is awakened by a text message on his phone from Eric, warning him not to come to Hawaii, but not saying why. It appears it was sent in haste. Attempts to call his brother yield no results. Worried, Peter flies to Hawaii ahead of the others and is told Eric fell overboard in a freak boating accident and is presumed drowned. His body hasn't been found. The police show him a videotape shot by some tourists which shows Eric not falling but jumping off of the boat. In the same tape, Peter spots and recognizes Alyson Bender, the woman who came to the college with Vincent Drake, among the onlookers.<br /><br />The rest of the grad students arrive in short order and they're driven to Nanigen's isolated jungle facility in a Bentley. Drake takes them on a tour of a diverse jungle ecosystem before revealing that Nanigen's secret is shrinking technology! By means of something called a tensor core, invent by a scientist named Ben Rourke, Nanigen can shrink objects and people down to tiny size and send them into the \\"micro-world.\\" Their scientists have been exploring the Hawaiian jungle for some time in this manner.<br /><br />Peter decides to confront Drake about Eric's mysterious death. The two men and Alyson go into another room where accusations are hurled... and quickly proven correct. The minute Peter so much as suggests Drake had something to do with Eric's death, Drake punches him. He and Alyson quickly decide they need to \\"disappear\\" Peter. Fearing he spoke to the other six about his suspicions, Drake decides they ALL need to disappear. Hitting an alarm, he manufactures somenonsense about an emergency and gets everyone to go into what he calls a saferoom. He and Alyson \\"assist\\" the stunned Peter, and, finding a technician in the control room, Drake pushes the guy into the \\"saferoom\\" with the students to \\"help\\" them, and promptly shrinks all eight people down.<br /><br />Capturing the teeny humans in a bag, Drake initially intends to feed them to a snake kept in one of the labs, but is interrupted when the cops come around with questions about Eric's \\"accident.\\" While Drake is talking to them, Alyson has an attack of conscience and sticks the shrunken humans in her purse. Rather than actually help them by returning them to normal size, she \\"lets them go\\" outside. Finishing with the cops, who depart, Drake comes up with a foolproof plan. The students, rejoiced at being hired, went and got drunk, and drove off a cliff into the ocean. Oh, and, as punishment for betraying him, Alyson is knocked out and put in the car. She goes over the cliff and drowns.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Peter, Karen, Rick, Erika, Amar, Danny, Jenny and the Nanigen technician guy, Kinsky, discover themselves in the teeny tiny jungle world. It isn't long before poor Kinsky gets gobbled up by hungry army ants, leaving the remaining seven to realize just how thoroughly screwed they are, unless they can make it back to the lab and make themselves normal sized again...<br /><br />Since almost everyone knows this was only a partially finished novel by Crichton, published posthumously and finished up by another author (Richard Preston in this instance) I'll avoid going into that except to mention it here at the beginning. I'm unsure which parts were written by Crichton and which were written by Preston; Crichton being credited first certainly suggests he wrote the bulk of the novel, but, then again, it could also be out of simple respect or because he's the more well-known author.<br /><br />In any event, I'd never heard of Micro prior to seeing it for sale at Kerr Drug the other week. The cover, depicting a silvery spider following silvery human footprints immediately called to mind Richard Matheson's The Incredible Shrinking Man. This and the book's title certainly clued me in to the idea that it was about shrinking (or possibly about enlarging ordinary-sized animals into giants, thus making humans \\"microscopic\\" in a sense), but I found the plot summary on the back to be very cryptic. I flipped through it. What little I glanced over didn't exactly grab me. Nor did the book's nearly $10 price point. Seriously, $10 for a paperback? In the end, I'm unsure what finally did possess me to just chuck it onto the checkout counter at the pharmacy and go home with it... but I do know that once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I devoured it, finishing it in just one night.<br /><br />Despite this, I can't say I exactly enjoyed it. As I said, the plot synopsis on the back cover was woefully cryptic, and so I didn't quite know what to expect going in. I was left unimpressed by the prologue, and initially wasn't quite hooked when we get introduced to the grad students at the lab, but once Peter's brother Eric shows up with Vincent Drake, and the miniature plane is found in the car, and suddenly Eric disappears and is presumed dead, the story really grabbed me. By the time Peter and the gang get shrunk down to bug size by the conniving Drake and set loose in the Hawaiian jungle to fend for themselves, I was loving it. Unfortunately, the ensuing adventure they have isn't all that great. And the reason why has to do with, ultimately, the manner in which the novel is written.<br /><br />It all feels very, very rushed. Like it was a very detailed but incomplete plot outline that was very quickly finished and then published. It reads like a junior novelization of a Hollywood movie and a particularly dull one at that. Except for Peter, the characters are all some of the most cliched caricatures I've ever encountered in a mainstream novel. Typically, I only find characters this by-the-numbers in a sleazy exploitation novel from the 80's. As I said, Peter is the one character who comes across as fully developed... and he's iced at the end of the third act, which kind of annoyed me. But at least it was different and shocking. So, even in his death, Peter did well.<br /><br />I can't say the same for the others. Rick is the typical stoic manly man's man. He has belligerent sexual tension with Karen. So, of course, in the finest tradition of 1950's-era sci-fi, they wind up falling madly in love for no reason. No, really. It just suddenly says they're falling in love, and that's it. Karen is your typical butt-kicking female protagonist. Danny is the typical annoying, craven coward nobody likes and who betrays the group (although in his defense he was pushed to his emotional limits). Amar Singh is a gentle pacifist who stupidly refuses even to kill a gigantic marauding centipede (!). I liked him up until that moment, and was rather glad when he finally dies. There's Erika, but, apart from her repeatedly stated nationality, left no impression on me at all. There's also Jenny, a lesbian who, again, apart from this single character trait, was a cypher.<br /><br />And then there is Vincent Drake, who is the most unbelievably cartoonishly evil villain I've ever encountered since Darren Penward in Carnosaur. Nothing he does makes even the barest minimum of logical sense, serving only to dig him deeper and deeper into the hole of his own creation, and he is at all times needlessly sadistic, without even the smallest sympathetic or humanizing qualities. He even has a portrait of himself in his office, he's so stereotypically arrogant! And yet, I loved him. Why? Because other than Peter he was the one character I felt had any passion to him. He takes such joy in being evil for the sake of it, and his hyperactive insanity while committing his evil acts is pretty infectious; it's hard not to respect the guy for loving what he does, despite how boneheaded he is, as far as evil masterminds go.<br /><br />A couple things. Despite reading like a junior novelization, Micro is shockingly, shockingly gory. No sooner have the heroes been shrunk than token red shirt Kinsky is torn to bits by ants almost out of nowhere. I knew the guy was doomed but jeez! The demise of Telius, one of Drake's security men shrunken down and sent to hunt down the miniaturized good guys, is nasty as well. We get a pretty detailed description of what happens when a normal-sized spider bites a shrunken human... and it ain't pretty.<br /><br />Then there's Danny. Oh boy. Poor, poor Danny. Stung by a parasitic wasp, he has wasp larvae in his arm for essentially the entire remaining portion of the novel up until his death. Yeah, he's a cowardly, unlikable creep, but I was rather disturbed by the manner in which the book, and the other characters, treat his predicament. The scene where he's first stunt is written as being uncomfortably sexual in manner for one thing. And when his plight first comes to light, the reaction of Rick and Karen basically boils down to not giving a crap. Even Crichton and Preston forget he's infected with wasp larvae half the time, up until the three encounter Rourke, whose solution is to... cut off Danny's arm. What? Can't they cut the larvae out one by one? Surely they're easy to see. Why do they need to cut his entire arm off?!<br /><br />So what stuff did I like? Well, as I said, I liked Drake, despite how ineffectual he is. And while the novel was pretty by the numbers, it did take some interesting turns. The author(s) throw you off by killing off the most obvious first victim, Kinsky, making you think you know who'll make it and in what order they'll die... only for Peter to die not long afterward. Once Peter, up until now the main character, eats it, you aren't sure who'll make it, and to be honest, despite being disgusted with how he was treated by the narrative, I was amazed Danny lasted as long as he did. I liked the fight with the centipede and the concept of Drake covering his bases by sending shrunken hitmen after the heroes, rather than trust in the jungle to kill them, the one smart move he makes as a villain. I liked the Japanese cop, Watanabe, and his investigations into Drake and the missing students and how despite not knowing about the shrinking technology, he can put two and two together. I liked how Eric turned up alive. It made Peter's death even more bittersweet, but was still refreshingly surprising.<br /><br />The sequel hook with Drake's partner Edward Catel was odd. Catel disappears for half the novel only to reappear at the end, long after most people have forgotten about him, and swipes a disc containing info about the shrinking technology. Since Crichton is no longer with us, and, except for The Lost World, he didn't really do sequels, this strikes me as really weird. I get the impression this was something Preston added. There's another sequel hook, too, with Karen wanting to return to the \\"micro-world.\\" Perhaps one day we'll see such a sequel?<br /><br />Anyway, to bring this rambling excuse for a review to a close, Micro was good but not great. It felt rushed and cliched but had enough good parts to be well worth a look, for Michael Crichton fans as well as fans of sci-fi in general.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|Less groove songs, not as much swagger.  Expected a heavier record.  Simpler pop songs, with a retro 70's feel to it.  I am long time fan, but I confess to not understanding this one too much.  But hey, I could be wrong.
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game plays like Angry Birds but from a first person perspective. Therefore precision is much more important. Great variety of levels, items, and fun challenges as well. I played through the entire game and am docking a point for the few levels which are currently unbeatable/ungoldable.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|In my opinion the story is much too much drawn out. Even though I usually enjoy<br />reading Lee Child's book, this one I didn't care for the the story.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|The movie wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be, but it was enjoyable, some parts where better then others. I guess with such a strong cast I expected the movie to be outstanding, and it was like too many other movies that have been made on same topic. I think also I love Jennifer Lopez, but I think this is her third movie about her having a baby, I don't think she should have done it, I totally enjoy her, but she just shouldn't have done another movie like this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very interesting.  A great resource tool for cooking and craft ideas.  Also a fabulous way to waste many hours when you should be doing something productive.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|i love this game  stay up playing the game and lose track of time  really enjoy playin the game  keeps your ind working
B008G12ERC|5.0|I like the CD. It's not the best Muse has done but it's not the worst. The CD is 100% worth buying.<br /><br />I would like hear Muse experiment more with different sounds and rhythms.. I confess that could be my Radiohead talking. :)
0894803123|5.0|I love ice cream and a while back I bought myself an ice-cream maker so I could experiment with different flavours. At the same time I bought this book as Ben and Jerry's is one of my favourite ice-cream brands (along with Blue Bell, but they don't have a recipe book) and because the book had lots of good reviews. I am really glad I did! The reviews are right! This book is full of easy, delicious recipes that are quick to make. I've tried lots of them and they are all a hit with my family. I've even started experimenting with a few of my own using Ben and Jerry's base mixture.<br /><br />My only worry about the recipes is that they use raw egg, which you then mix in with sugar, milk and cream (plus flavouring).
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Really good book, Couldn't stay away. Awesome series and I would recommend this book to people that like war books/ Gladiator book like thing.  :)
0316228532|5.0|I am very surprised by all the reviewers who compare this book to HP, and despair.  It's like comparing toothpaste and a candy bar because they both might be made by the same company.  This is adult realistic fiction - it's not young adult fantasy.  Very well written, very literate, very rich and even though it's 500 pages, it's good to the last drop.  I read this book over a weekend and enjoyed it all - wasn't even tempted to skim.  Entertaining yet not superficial.  Yes, the book actually touches on real life, even some of the aspects of real life that are not pretty.  Nothing tawdry, just real things that happen to real people.  It's not sensationalized nor is it sugarcoated.  I am glad that I did not believe all the negative reviews and got to enjoy this book.
B007DIQC90|5.0|What got my attention was a beautiful time-lapse video using the song 'Slow And Steady'..(ICELANDIA - Time-lapse Visuals from 64° North).<br /><br />'My Head Is an Animal' is impressive. The whole CD is beautifully done. I would recommend this CD.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This story was awesome found myself wanting to punch Abby at times but then i would get over it. you cant help but love Travis which gave me a love/hate thing with Abby. i cannot wait for walking disaster...I just hate that i have to wait so long
B002MQYOFW|5.0|so many things to like in the book. the details of the action , and the hardships these people have to face. it deserves five stars.
0316227706|5.0|If you are a dog lover or know anyone that loves dogs - you need this book!  It's like nothing I have ever seen.  Try to look at these photos and not smile :)
B00499LTLM|5.0|Of all the many british or american attempts, this is by far the most entertaining rendition of this classic character. The stories are drawn from some of the most beloved adventures and updated to a modern setting while staying true to the spirit of the original. Sherlock himself is superbly presented with the keen intelligence for which he is famed along with charming quirk that doesn't alienate the viewer or come across as pedantic.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A great surprise reading this book, one expects to read about courage under fire, but to read about courage in life, made even stronger by Christian religion, and great family values, places this book as one of my best read's ever. An inspirational warrior, Christian and family man - Adam Brown.<br /><br />I could not put it down, and finished it in 4 days.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This item fit my Kindle very well and so far, after having it on the device for about 2 weeks, I am still very happy with it.  I did drop it once all ready, about 3 feet onto a concrete floor and did its job.  The only complaints I have would be it is overpriced - after all it is just a piece of plastic and 1 strap.  But, I have not found anything better, so maybe it is what it is.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|A little slow to build up, good middle but the ending was anticlimatic,almost as if the Author ran out of ideas. It feels like a progression from Killing Floor, as it shoulld be, but our hero seems to spend a little too long observing rather than acting.  I have read his later work which is much more rounded.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I'm an avid Facebook user and although I had minor issues with the pages not loading and having to retype a few status' due to an &quot;error&quot;, I was still quite content with it overall. But ever since it prompted the update for this app, it hardly works. I'm lucky if it will load my notifications. The news feed doesnt load and all it says is that there was an error and to try again later.  Messages won't load, if it gets past the &quot;error try again later &quot; it takes forever and a day just to post a status. I'm very frustrated as I cant do anything with this shoddy update. I have an HTC EVO shift. I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling and its done nothing.<br />I'm so frustrated with Facebook developmers trying to update everything so much that it ends up being worse than before. If it works and people are happy, I say leave it be and stop trying to fix what's now broken.<br />sincerely,<br />Frustrated.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome book cant wait untill the nxt  one comes out it will be awesome a,  a a a a a
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the best book of the series abd i think Rick Riordan did a great job i also like how he included annabeth oh and spoiler annabeth does not die overall i give it a five star rating so buy this book you won't regret it.
B004GYY714|5.0|I was very pleased to find that this app works very well,has great content and the music sounds great on my kindle fire.
B009CPES4I|3.0|The \\"Marigold\\" movie was definitely entertaining.  The characters were believable.  It was funny.  It had its tender moments.  We enjoyed watching it.  There was just no \\"oomph\\" to it.  But definitely worth a look.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|I bought this music, therefore I must be a freak, but I like what I hear. Or better yet, you're the freak who doesn't know good music when you hear it. You like what you like, and you can like no further. You're conditioned by what you hear mainstream, Now, I don't buy Metallica music. Don't get me wrong, I think Metallica are the best at what they do, nobody's better, they just don't do it for me. And Lou Reed? He's always worth a listen. I have great respect for his musical accomplishments but I don't buy Lou Reed, his music just doesn't do it for me. Again, don't get me wrong, I think Lou Reed's music is very interesting and sometimes there are moments of greatness. If you're reading this review then you must somewhat agree with me. Anyway, when I first heard that Metallica and Lou Reed were hooking up, I was interested, even thought of buying the album without hearing it. But then I read the reviews on Amazon and blew off buying it. Months and months passed and something in the  back of mind kept nagging me to stay close to the music though I knew nothing much about it: I read many reviews, listen to thirty-second sound bytes time and time again, checked and rechecked for used CDs at my local Music hangout, kept it in my Amazon Wish List, yet, nothing spurred me into putting down the buck and buying Lulu. Then I listened to the minute and a half song previews on iTunes and was driven to buy Lulu, for bad or worse. Now I @#%$*^# love Lulu. Reviews are like crap, such a waste. I happen to think I have the best musical taste going and that I never buy crap music, however, to all you negative reviewers who absolutely hate this music, I must have #$@% for brains. Damn, and I've been buying music for decades. What I could do with all that money spent, I could have bought an island off the coast of France or a villa in Venice. One last final note, I'd wager that Lou Reed thought Lulu was good or he wouldn't have released it. And I think it's safe to guess that Metallica had  positive inclinations towards the music, otherwise, they walked knowingly into the Lulu abyss and couldn't get out, but I doubt that was the way it was. I say both these great artist like the music so one big giant bird-finger to all you negative reviewers, I like the company I keep. Peace!a had  positive inclinations towards the music, otherwise, they walked knowingly into the Lulu abyss and couldn't get out, but I doubt that was the way it was. I say both these great artist like the music so one big giant bird-finger to all you negative reviewers, I like the company I keep. Peace!
B008966SIU|5.0|While a two word review would be enough, the fun part here is getting others to give it a listen. Here I am , almost 60, and my kids are turning ME on to great music. Several years ago I heard \\"Veckatimest\\" and was bowled over. Always the curious type, I went searching to learn who these guys are. I always have fun trying to describe music to people to get them interested. Grizzly Bear is a tough one, because the name says like they ought to be a punk band but in fact sound like something I have never heard before, sort of like if Brian Wilson and his brothers had grown up in NYC and hung out in the Village.<br />There is a tad of the Beach Boy thing here on \\"Yet Again\\" and \\"Gun-Shy\\". Then you have a cool jazz groove on \\"What's Wrong?\\", and the soaring, \\"make you hair stand up\\" closer \\"Sun in Your Eyes\\".<br />Now, I realize that hard-core rockers will find this stuff to be a crashing bore. If you have been a rock fan for 50 years and listen to all kinds of music like I do, check this out. It's that good.
0525952926|5.0|Excellent continuation of the story of the families who somehow continue to overlap. The book is well written and keeps your attention. Ken Follet makes you care about the characters as conditions force them to adapt in order to overcome adversity. I did not want to put the book down.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've always enjoyed the 'Reacher' stories, but I now know the end results before I get throu the first chapter. I'll miss the excitement of the stories that I've read, but it's now time to move on!
B005HEWIHW|2.0|This episode hits two high peaks that cascade into deep valleys very quickly.<br /><br />Someone on Voyager is putting Maquis crewmembers into comas and Tuvok is on the case. Problem for him though is, he's the one using mind melds to put them under. Turns out, a pissed off Maquis scientist implanted some kind of memory suggestion into Tuvok (back when he was undercover in the Alpha quadrant) and is only now activating it through mail sent from the Pathfinder project. Tuvok \\"reawakens\\" the Maquis crewmember's need to be...well Maquis.<br /><br />It's awesome to see the Starfleet and Maquis crews fighting each other again, as that conflict was dropped after the first season. Yeah, the conflict is created through some rather bogus means, but seeing Chakotay and crew take over the ship presented the possibility that deep down, the Maquis still carry some animosity towards Starfleet. Seeing the ship taken over and Tuvok's struggle are the two highlights of this episode.<br /><br />It's to bad though that none of it meant anything. Everything is quickly reversed and we go back to our normal, happy crew. Also, what is the point of a Maquis crew that is nowhere near the Demilitarized Zone? What about Starfleet's reaction to a group of rebels taking over Voyager? What did the Maquis scientist hope to achieve?<br /><br />It's a great concept for an episode (this could have been a two-parter), but it falls way short of taking advantage of it.
0307592731|3.0|Cheryl Strayed makes it clear in her memoir she always wanted to write. It seems clear she is a fine author, however, this book was not my favorite read.  She's a little hard to follow. She meets so many people along the trail, I kept getting confused on who was who. The story is also not riveting, not what I would call a page-turner. I think all in all I'm a fan of the story, but not of Ms. Strayed's writing style. In reading a memoir, I expect to encounter personal issues and deep trauma or private matters to come to surface, however, she was quite graphic with some of her descriptions and I could have done without some of her details of her sex life, toe nails falling off...etc. I had also hoped that it would be more of an inspirational read, but at the end, I found myself not wanting to strap on my boots and go for a hike so much as I just wanted a shower...and a Snapple Lemonade.
0385344333|5.0|Lee Child entertains his audience as always. The book is another of a long series of Jack Reacher adventures that keep you wanting to turn the page. It is a written equivalent of a super hero comic book, and I mean this in a good way. Good triumphs over evil once again and Jack fades into his long journey to wherever he goes next.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All 3 of the books gripped me. I could not put them down and could not wait to re-read each of them after finishing all 3! I thought they read well and each left you hungry to start the next. They were like a literary roller coaster ride.  I feel like I know all of the characters personally.
B005HEW818|4.0|I feel that Star Trek is always at its best when it's commenting on our world, while performing in an alien one. Issues like racism, war, sex, and other critical topics that aren't easily approachable in shows set in modern times, Star Trek can get away with it. Most Star Trek fans know this and that's why we love it.<br /><br />'Critical Care' fits into this tradition very well by looking at health care and the privileged versus the less fortunate. The Doctor is kidnapped and brought to a world where medical care is determined by a computer algorithm. Who ever is more useful to society, gets higher care, while those whom are basically below the poverty line get a band aid. The Doctor is furious and sets about doing whatever he can to get equal treatment for everyone.<br /><br />This episode was made over a decade ago, but it feels more relevant then ever. Whichever side you fall on when it comes to medical care in a society, you'll find something to gnaw on.<br /><br />Positive Points<br /><br />- Robert Picardo. I've said in previous reviews that Voyager's cast is its greatest strength and this episode is no different. Picardo has a lot to work with here and he is great to watch. The scene in which he gets raw on the administrator is an interesting, dark moment for his character.<br /><br />Negative Points<br /><br />- The big eyed kid who just wants to live. It was a bit corny, but not a total deal breaker.
B000IAXVHG|5.0|In 1968, two other individuals and I watched Star Ttrek at Ft Myers, VA. Most persons thought the series<br />was crap. In 1977, I returned to the area and Star Trek drew standing room only in the day room at Ft Myers.<br />It took more than seven years for many to learn how good Star Trek is. In reruns the quality of show became a hit.<br />LOL, I guess we were just ahead of our time.<br />Thanks seller.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie answered some questions but left me asking just as many that got answered. I liked this movie alot and it is definitely one that you should not be without. There will be a second movie to tie this in with the alien franchise. Well, there should be. Dont be left in the cold, if you are an alien fan, then you need to watch this movie.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|This is my favorite show!!! Order came in great shape and in a timely fashion. Absolutely love Suits, now I need season 2.
B005HEVVOI|3.0|Tom and B'Elanna's relationship has never been great from a story standpoint, but is has been a pleasant one, which is not a gripe. Things can be good and that is perfectly fine. T&B are cool characters who where brought together as lovers in a way I found sudden. Throwing them into the meat freezer of outer space and letting heavy emotions boil up from (as I thought) out of nowhere, just didn't seem earned.<br /><br />Since then though, I've grown to like watching Dawson and McNeill bounce off each other. There is a sweet and sort of real nature to the way they argue and respect one another. `Drive' takes them to the next step by once again, getting them into a small space together and forcing heavy emotions to rise up. This time though, it doesn't feel like a sideswipe.<br /><br />Positive Points<br /><br />- Dawson and McNeill. Voyager's primary fault at times is its storytelling, but infrequently does it not give its acting talent room to stretch. BLT and Turkey Platter are fun to hang around with.<br /><br />- Space Racing. Space races are cool.<br /><br />Negative Points<br /><br />- The sabotage sub-plot. This didn't hold water for me. Couldn't Tom just set the race aside to work on things with B'Elanna, then after patching up, hauled ass to the finish line in spectacular fashion? Would have been more interesting then more evil aliens and exploding warp cores.<br /><br />- Relationship advice from Neelix when no one asked for it.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|999 was suggested to me by my best friend, and i can see why she was crazy about!! the plot is really great, and the fact it has different endings is a really fun way for you to get more information without going through redundant dialogue.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I watched this today having doubts about it because most movies never turn out how you want them too; I probably would have originally gave this movie a 2 out of 5 but the ending of this movie was a pretty good one. It made me go \\"Oh wow that was pretty awesome.....?\\" and change my whole mind about this movie in just them few seconds lol. It also made me think, WTF, than laugh when I realized what it was portraying. Its worth a watch.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Fun and addicting. There are some glitches, esp. when visiting friends (maybe different platforms?), but still very fun. Best to sign up w/GameLoft to make friends to get acorns and hearts which are necessary to buy things in the game and make goals.<br /><br />Update -- I had to drop a couple of stars because of the poor customer service relating to the game. It has been several months since I've been able to visit my friends and send them gifts -- and this is an integral part of the game!! -- and emails to customer service have been promptly answered and courteous... but ultimately have done nothing. It's probably been 5 months since I've received any acorns from any of my friends, and I was previously getting 30+ gifts per day. Not being able to receive acorns really hampers the fun of the game; in order to advance you just have to rely on luck to get one acorn a week, or leave the game on all day long wasting your battery to get snow piles to hope for one acorn a day (and with most of the animals costing 100+ acorns at the higher levels of the game, you see how long it would take to get a new animal!).<br /><br />Anyway, it's a fun game to play as long as you can receive gifts from your friends; but after nearly six months of IAV not being able to get its act together for this vital part of the game, that makes the game almost no fun at all, and it almost seems as if they're intentionally not fixing this \\"glitch\\" so that you'll have to buy the acorns using real money. Hmm....
B008AT71WI|5.0|The Director's cut is awesome! I had to watch it twice! Seymour and Audrey both die and the plant takes over the world! I loved it!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I enjoyed this CD so much.  I have loved Bob Dylan since I fist heard him in 1964. He is an American treasure and this album makes me think of the young Bob.  He always has a message and it always makes sense.  His voice has never been great but the way he usese it is wonderful.  He is my hero and I hope he keeps right on telling it like it is, or should be.  Thank you Bob.
0525953728|3.0|No Easy Day covers the raid to kill Osama Bin Ladin from the perspective of one of the SEALS who was there.  While some details of the raid are left out for security reasons there is still more than enough detail to paint a vivid picture of what happened.<br /><br />When you pick up this book don't expect a great piece of writing.  The writing is clear and concise but nothing special.  It's told by a soldier, and it has the no nonsense style of a soldier.<br /><br />One thing that should be mentioned.  Almost half of this book does not deal with the raid itself.  The author flashes back to several incidents in his time at the SEALS.  While these incidents were interesting I felt somewhat misled.  The book bills itself as being about the raid so the long 100 page detour to unrelated events was not what I was expecting.<br /><br />That said, I'm glad I read this book and would still recommend it to others. Not for the writing, but because of the subject it covers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game a lot. It is a simple solitaire game with easy controls. I only wish the ads were easier to get around.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you should play it its really fun and<br />dont give u youll love it its changing ixperience and worth itnand fun yoll wanna play it all the time
B0015DWJX2|4.0|The book was an easy read. I enjoyed the bits of historical fiction throughout. I've often wondered how people bounced back after WWII, when their land was destroyed & families were separated. The book proved how resilient people are!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The last book was a great end to this dynamic story of power, love, sex and money. I loved reading it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really love Pinterest. it is very fun and I get tons of new ideas. :D I would recommend this.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like this app, it gives plenty of detail on how much time and charge I have left, sometimes it glitches and it says 98 percent and its really fully charged
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|great movie a classic gives a little look into the war. a must see i have seen it at least 20 times.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Could not wait to read this 2nd book of the Crossfire series! I loved it more than the first. I really like the way she writes. There is a nice blend of all things that make a good romance novel. It kept me hooked till the end & I already preordered the 3rd book \\"Entwined with you\\" due out the last day of December. I thought that with this book, it took over the coveted spot by Fifty Shades. Although terribly make-believe, the plot, the characters are more realistic than Fifty, and Gideon is giving Christian a run for his money. This book ties up some of the loose ends from the first but leaves you wanting more. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. A truly easy read!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I knew this was going to be a different book from the Harry Potter series, but I had not at all expected something so dark and grim and depressing.<br /><br />This book just was a struggle to get through, also because of my lack of interest in anything political. I just don't care who sits on the town council, or who is from which part of the tracks.<br /><br />I gave up on the print version and switched to the audiobook (once again they got a good narrator, which made it much easier to finish).<br /><br />I really hope her J.K. Rowling got all the misery out of her system, and that her next book will be a different one.<br />One that allows me to - like with the Potter books - escape to a happy (magical or not) place, one that instantly lets me get lost in the story, one that I don't want to stop reading and that keeps me up late. All of which was really not the case for me with this book.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie was such a delight to watch.  I was worried that I wouldnt enjoy it much due to the strong accents, but the accents even made it MORE enjoyable!  Each character is portrayed perfectly.  I definitely recommend this movie.  A must see!  And, a must have for your dvd library!
B000GW8RX4|4.0|First the not-so-good: The video quality, while passable, is not great. Granted, the footage was shot more than thirty years ago. I still believe that it could have been cleaned up better than what it is. However, it would, I'm sure, be a more costly DVD. But give Simon Robinson credit, he did a great job considering the source material. I love the reproduction tour programme!<br />Sound quality is better and worthy of a good theater system.<br />For those who have complained about Blackmore's seemingly endless solos, I say that was made Rainbow so exciting in the day. I never saw Rainbow live with Dio and I'm sure I'd be one of those who would be awed by his performances. Remember, this is just a DVD and as such will not totally capture the spirit of actually seeing Rainbow.<br />And remember this:  Rainbow was Ritchie's baby. He could do what he wanted. Yes, he did have an ego but that ego wasn't without merit.<br />Overall a quality product....<br />Too bad nothing exists from the previous tour which included Tony Carey and Jimmy Bain. THAT was a lineup! And I almost failed to mention Dio's performance: Simply amazing!
0425263908|1.0|I have no Idea how the book is. I have not received it yet. I have sent email to company asking where the book is.
0062082353|5.0|I \\"borrowed\\" this book. I love military books. I grew up reading nearly every (book)soldiers first person account of the vietnam war. So thought I would try one from a more current war as an adult..<br /><br /> This book was fantastic, sad, funny, exciting and eye opening! I could not put it down. Chris Kyle had an amazing journey as a Navy Seal and his ghost writer did an amazing job with his story. As I said above. I've read a million military books and this is easily my favorite.<br /><br />After reading the book, I felt incredibly guilty for \\"borrowing\\" (ahem)... it and not spending the money on an american hero. It was even worse once i found out the money made from this book is donated to fallen seal families. I bought 10 copies of this book to apease my own guilt. Worth every penny and everyone whos recieved a copy loved the book!<br /><br />There is nothing I hate more then buying a book after reading positive reviews.. only to find the book was no good and the reviews written by friends, family and even the author! The reviews for this book are spot on! You wont be dissapointed and i feel I confident recommending it. Loved it!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0062082353 American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History]]
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I hesitated to watch this due to all the negative reviews.  After viewing, I'm not sure why it received so many poor reviews.  In my opinion, if you go into the film with no expectations (must be an Alien type movie), it is worth watching.  I found it to be a good movie, and worth the minimal rent fee.  Just my two cents.......
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game. challenging.appreciate the mellow music. use this when waiting for an appointment. when relaxation is needed. degree of difficulty increases. fun and relaxing

B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follet is a master storyteller.  He makes the history of the second world war come alive in the families that he follows.  A good sequel to the first book in the series.
0525478817|5.0|Amazing! Amazing! No, seriously, A-MAZ-ING! I laughed and I cried, well more like sobbed uncontrollably. This book was phenomenal. I loved Augustus, Isaac, and Hazel. Their humor kept me laughing and Hazel and Augustus love story was beautiful. Wow! (So amazing, I can barely string together coherent thoughts after finishing it.)
B008XG1X18|4.0|i love this app... especially compared to the previous pinterest app i had on my kindle fire. it is sooo user friendly and easy to move around in. the only problem is that every now and then it takes a long time to load when i first start it up. a few times it wouldn't even load at all and I had to force close. other than those small issues I am very pleased with this app.
B008RNYNDM|5.0|A gentle and sensitive examination of the developing lifelong friendship between Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt?<br />A careful analysis of the musical influences between the two composers?<br />No. Lisztomania isn't like that.<br /><br />Russell created some great films, but he always had a tendency to push the envelope, and once in a while he went completely over the top. This is one of those kind of films. The giant phallus, zombie Wagner with Hitler moustache and machine gun, a cameo appearance of Ringo Starr, as the Pope, and countless other extravagances soon confirm that this is Russell at his wildest. Lisztomania is self indulgent to a fault, gratuitously offensive to the memory of Wagner and Liszt, chaotic and silly.<br /><br />However, it's great fun.<br /><br />If you like Extreme Russell, you'll love this film.<br /><br />If you are offended by jokes at the expense of Richard Wagner, you might like to stick to Anna rather than Ken.

BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!

1606863622|4.0|This book was one of the best books and the worst. It was very entertaining. About a 20 year old guy named John who was mostly a rebel in highschool. He finially decided he was tired of his childish ways and enlisted in the army.When he got on leave for a few weeks in the summer, he met the most amazing girl he had ever met. Her name was Savannnah, and to John somehow she was different from all the girls he had met. They promised that when John was out of the Army they would get married. When 911 struck John had to enlist again, and it would be 2 to 3 more years before they could get married. While he was at war Savannah went and got married to her life long friend Tim. This made me really mad because they promised to get married and when John found out that she was in love with someone else he was crushed. He came back to North Carolina so talk to Savannah. once he finds her he later finds out that Tim has cancer and is doing terribly. In the end he donates all this money that he inherited from his fathers valuable coin collection, to Tim. I just wanted to cry because savannah and John would have been perfect together and they never ended up together. It was a very well written book but very sad.
B008RTE066|4.0|The packaging for the Deluxe Box Set has been done right at last. Finally, some quality control, unlike the USB disaster. However, the 5.1 is incredibly disappointing. \\"Love\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" were carefully reproduced for multichannel, but this mix is far inferior. The picture quality is superb, bringing many welcome details to light. Love it or hate it, this is a must own for any Beatles fan.<br />My biggest caution to anyone considering purchasing the set is that if you pay more than $79 you are getting ripped off. It's been for sale (in-store and online) since 4 October at $79. Do a search and buy it...or get an extra copy.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers is arguably the best superhero movie ever released in the 21st century. It is an accumulation of some of the important marvel superheros to engage into collaborative epic battle against the wicked Loki. The story is perhaps the best about the movie, unlike many superhero movies where actions are epic and story sucks. The Avengers contains some of the best stories in any superhero movies ever released since the beginning of the movie industry.

B000O6G7JS|5.0|Who Are You contains some of The Who's most interesting songs. Although, it may not be their most innovative and prolific album, it contains their signature 60's hard rock blues style nonetheless. Tragically it was the last album with Keith Moon before he passed away two weeks later.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|As remakes go, this was a wild ride; questionable science, bad choice of plot and cheesy dialogue, but I liked what I saw. I loved The Phantom of the Opera (1925), Frankenstein (1931), Dracula (1931), The Mummy (1932), Planet of the Apes (1968), Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980), Friday the 13th (1980) and many others, but it did not detract from my enjoyment of the many remakes of the Phantom, Franky, Drac or the Mummy (the 1959 Mummy is actually my fav); nor was I disappointed with the remakes for Halloween or Friday the 13th. Yeah, the remake of Planet of the Apes could have been better (lots better) and the new Fog made little sense but it was nice to see what could be done with all of the franchise titles with more money to create better effects (look at Bram Stoker's Dracula!) and an ever-changing social structure. I know, the time travel twist in the new Trek was cheesy, monotonous and a cop-out, but let's be honest, J.J. Abrams is a cheesy director and he always ignores continuity with a dizzying rollarcoaster of neuroses; as far as I'm concerned Star Trek: Nemesis is the end of my childhood Trek adventures; this new movie should be viewed as a remake (good or bad, and there is a lot of both) that gives us a new, if not goofy, look at a deep well of ideas where Gene Roddenberry believed that politics, economy, religion and human need would fall away into a bright, historically rich universe where people made the future every time someone beamed down or pulled out of spacedock. The new Trek showed us the Starfleet Academy, showed us life on Earth and showed us a diversity chosen not forced (which has always been Roddenberry's dream)...and we got a fun, silly movie that I still marvel over. The Romulans? Enough, already; we saw them last in Nemesis. Let's go where no one has gone before (hence the 4 stars) and see something new and original. But I'm afraid me may need a visionary writer, director and producer at Paramount; Abrams makes eye candy and sells popcorn. He is not a visionary. Not a condemnation just an observation.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|A relatively interesting and entertaining marvel film. Thor contains a complex story that intertwines the fate of humanity. Much of the film revolves around the futuristic scenes of planets and the universe. A great marvel movie!

B009GQ57ES|5.0|I highly recommend this album. I have always been a fan of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, but this has made me love them even more. They cover a broad range of topics from having a freaking awesome time in a thrift shop to marriage equality. If you are looking for a good listen, like hip-hop, or even if you don't, this album will not disappoint. The words are meaningful and strike a cord when you listen with an open ear.<br /><br />Overall: Get this album, it will rock your world!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|There are too many holes in this story to be taken seriously for example:<br /><br />- Jules the reluctant hero of the story; we don't know much about her, we don't even know why she won't go see her father.  She seems to warm up to the idea of being the Sheriff with very little prodding and even less thinking about the consequences given that she only knows the life in the lower levels of the silo.<br /><br />- Jules' father is there only briefly to tell us why HE thinks Jules won't come see him and that's all. This could have been a very interesting subplot but it was truncated before it even started.<br /><br />- Lukas the love interest of Jules; we know that he watches stars and he has a mother. What happened to his father? He works IT but why? For how long? Why is he suddenly so interested in a woman he has only seen twice to the point of going against his employer and his way of life?<br /><br />- Bernard the villain of the story: he has a belly, he wears eyeglasses but who is he? Why is he such an elitist? In a world that is technologically advanced to have subcutaneous contraceptive implants for young girls and ways to treat and purify water and sustain plant life underground, they haven't figured out how to correct vision problems?<br /><br />- Teenagers in a silo that has been abandoned for decades. How is that possible? Were they hatched?<br /><br />This is nowhere near the level of \\"Brave New World\\" or the Mars Trilogy, or anything written by Neil Gaiman (\\"Stardust\\", \\"American Gods\\", \\"Coraline\\" among many) but it was entertaining enough Sci-Fi lite, thus a rather generous 3 star rating.
0451167716|3.0|A great story with a lot more depth about the politics and machinations within the mafia than the movie (one of my favorite movies of all time, by the way).  You come out the back end of the book with an appreciation for the sheer cunning and manipulative skill required to thrive in the world of the Mafia.  Like some other books (Shogun comes to mind) you find yourself immersed in a world of casual brutality that, on its own terms, within its own context, sorta makes sense and is understandable -- repulsive, abhorrent, and yet strangely compelling for a 3-day reading fest.<br /><br />At the risk of committing sacrilege for Godfather fans, I would contend that the writing is very mediocre.  Puzo uses the much-maligned \\"headhopping\\" technique, in which the reader has access to the inner thoughts of multiple people within a single scene (sometimes within a single paragraph).  This technique is rarely used, because it keeps the reader emotionally distant from the characters, which indeed is a problem with this book.  Most of the time, you feel like you're peering in on the world of the Corleones as a spectator, rather than viscerally feeling it, and I think the headhopping is the reason for it.  More generally, there was a lot of content that had little to do with the main plot, and it got kind of tedious and frustrating:  whole chapters of minor characters in Las Vegas who were loosely if at all connected to the story, a girl getting a vaginoplasty for seemingly forever, pages and pages of background info on characters who were gone from the story right after they'd been described in detail.  But my biggest problem with the writing is that there is never a convincing explanation for why Mike Corleone suddenly decided to transform himself from somewhat-pacifistic and sensitive \\"civilian\\" to stone-cold killer and gangland boss, almost overnight.  It's the seminal moment and turning point of the book, and I was left thinking \\"I just don't buy it.\\"  In the hands of a more skilled novelist, it could've been a very powerful character arc, but in Godfather it just seems implausible.<br /><br />All that said, no one can deny the power of the story and the compellingly complex character Vito Corleone.  If anything, The Godfather is testament to how much a great story can override the limited prose skills of an author.skilled novelist, it could've been a very powerful character arc, but in Godfather it just seems implausible.<br /><br />All that said, no one can deny the power of the story and the compellingly complex character Vito Corleone.

B000LPS4BG|5.0|Good action tire real life,  just like if happen today. Action blood. Sex. And love.  Car chase gun fights bar fights killings
0316228532|4.0|I've noticed a majority of the one and two star reviews put the book down around the 100 page mark, and that is why I wanted to review this book.  First of all, I am a big Harry Potter fan- I absolutely loved the book series.  Second of all...try to forget that the same author wrote this book- it is nothing like Harry Potter.<br /><br />I really struggled to get into this book- I really had to force myself to get into it and read for about the first 75 to 100 pages.  A lot of characters are introduced quickly, and it took a long time reading before I could remember which character was which.  I finally started to get into it around the 100 page mark, but really didn't enjoy it until about fifty pages later.<br /><br />The last half of the book totally made up for the lack-luster first half in my opinion.  I would recommend it, but only if you are okay with foul language, adult themes such as sex and drug use, and some harsh social issues.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|I bought this processor for my home theatre PC, and the graphics are great. The streaming video is awesome, and the price point seems really reasonable. I definitely feel like this provides great bang for my buck!

B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is amazing.  I love how easy it is to use.  It is essential for visually creative people.  Intuitive!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved the premise of the story and I loved the attention to detail throughout the book  and I LOVED the story but I absolutely, unequivocably, hated the ending.  I devoured the book, reading at lunch and before setting my alarm each night.  Flynn is an excellent writer so I am not sure what took her down the fatal path.  Until the very last chapter, I was ready to buy each and every other book written by Flynn, Gone Girl being my first read. Not inclined to do so now.  Makes me sad, actually.....
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I am so angry; had this been the first book I had read of Child's I would NOT have read another.  That being said here goes:  It STINKS!  Nothing but filler and filler, constant ruminations (by Reacher) of signage, highways etc etc. ad infinitum.  Having Reacher describe tactics, guns to undercover FBI agents (one undercover) is totally absurd.  Perhaps this book is written when Jack is 90 and semi-senile and no guts, the meanderings are intolerable. The last 10 pages or so are the only thing that even hints at Reacher's intelligence and masculinity; he's totally wishy-washy.  The story line is so thin as to barely exist.  What was Lee Child thinking when he put this out?  He owes his faithful readers better than this and an apology for this drivel.  Any author can have a so-so book but this one is, in a word: STINKO!
B009329ZF2|1.0|I snagged this pile of offal from Redbox, so luckily I'm only out $1.29. It makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like Citizen Kane! I knew I was in for a beating when I saw the name Hasbro in the production credits and that it was likely nothing but an infomercial for some game, but I also saw the name Universal, and I thought to myself 'it couldn't be that bad' but boy was I wrong! After a nod to the ALIEN MENACE! in the first few minutes, this groaner veered into a seeming parody of character development in which the high (make that low) point is a heroic, albeit criminal acquisition of a chicken burrito to win the heart of his true love! Oh, the sacrifices our male lead won't perform for true love! (By the way, look up the word kitsch in a dictionary) But, his criminality in no way means Kitschy can't go to Annapolis and graduate as a lieutenant, no dear friends, for this is a true hero who will let no obstacle stand in his way, not even a technologically superior race of EVIL ALIENS!, not even the disapproving Admiral/father of his true love! After 28 minutes or so of ridiculous introductions of various cliched characters, and a blatant ripoff of Tora! Tora! Tora! the invasion finally gets underway, and by this point I can't look away the same way I look at horrific wrecks on the freeway; Oh, the carnage! Oh, the humanity! (At least with the Hindenberg, there were survivors..........but no one survives this pile of horse exhaust, from Liam Neeson to the caterer; although it's obvious thay all got paid well, a big budget doth not a good movie make). Oh, and the Missouri? Hasn't been to sea in 10 years? No problem, fire her up, she'll do it! Guns haven't been fired up in at least that long? Quick, roll a few rounds off that pickup on the dock! There's only, what, 10 or 12 of us to run a battleship? No problema ,can do!!! And, just to make sure we've got all the target markets covered, let's throw in everybody, from the kids to the geezer veterans, so that everyone in the audience has someone to identify with! I could go on and on about how bad it is, but too many other negative reviewers have touched on all its blatant absurdities.  Golden Turkey? At least, cooked properly, turkeys taste good; The taste of wasted time in my mouth won't go away soon, and I'm beginning to think I might be a masochist after all, even though I fast forwarded through probably 1/2 of this. It's really a Golden Cockroach. To paraphrase the Bard, it's a tale told by a retard, full of sound and fury, signifying.................absolutely NOTHING!!! Strictly for undiscerning 8 year old boys.
B009GE9Y44|4.0|Im a resident evil fan and i liked this movie i mostly watched it because i loved damnation so much and it went along with resident evil 6 kind of the same voice actors who played leon and ada wong. If you havent seen it it's a good rent.
1935597760|5.0|I read the Misremembered Man today and just finished it.  It is in some ways a heartbreaking book, but with authenticity and honesty about the difficult circumstances that some children live through, but with the resources they find within their minds that can sustain them into adulthood.  Thank you, Ms. McKenna.  Beautifully written, deeply empathic, and thankfully, with humorous, believable episodes that alleviate the darker elements.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never posted a review of a book before and I have read every classic and contemporary science fiction novel worth reading. This is a work of art destined to be classic fictional account of the human condition. It will quite possibly become required reading for social commentary across all literary genres. This is not really a sci-fi novel. It is about being human and what makes us so in a dark and desperate future. One you do not want to be in.<br /><br />For many years I considered \\"Enders Game\\" the best book ever written in the Sci-Fi genre. This book is a tie and probably even better.<br /><br />It is just a brilliant and flawless gem.

B0019X3ZZY|5.0|Well,I do not dent the fact that the film is well made but exaggeration can corrupt everything,and this film is full of it.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It's a little much to watch with teenagers - more sexual stuff than I would like.  But, the movie is a lot of fun,  dark and violent, but very funny and very crazy.  Great sound track.  I'm not going to do one of those reviews that tells you all about the movie.  I'm just going to say if you like the funny/violent/cool/werid/quirky vibe - sort of funny like Zombieland vibe - you'll like this movie.  I did, and watched it twice.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|Hi,<br />Well,I do not deny the fact that the film has a super quality production and declare its made very well,but......<br />Despite the fact the film can satisfy gore/torture fans but the story and the idea are shallow and weak,you can put in that way,superb film using a simple idea,also the dialog is weak too and does not add much to the film,in general you might enjoy the brutal scenes only.<br />Thats why I prefer 70s and 80s European films because they are too comprehensive and their makers are interested in making all film's factors perfect,not only good scenes,watch Dario Argento's films as an example.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love this series by Ken Follett. It is interesting and intertaining at the same time.It is a period of history that I do not know a lot about and I have been totally engaged in the story.I loved the first book and now the second. I can't wait for the third.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|And here I was thinking they couldn't get any better. I was wrong. There are very few albums that have good songs all the way through but this one does. If you liked the first one you will definitely like this one.

B004SBQAN8|5.0|A great movie!  I hope that Hollywood makes a follow-up with this movie.  The special effects were outstanding! This is why I purchased the movie, a great deal of action!  Would recommend the movie to anyone interested in action/adventure movies.

B008QE9XD2|5.0|I truly enjoined every minute of this DVD. I will enjoy watching it again. I will say if your not a old time Dark Shadows fan you will not understand the hidden titbits you will pick up on as you watch and listen to some of what is said.  My favorite was the party and the original Barnabas and other cast thats around  that came to the door at the party I knew it was in there and It was beautiful to see them.  I still think the original series in he 60's were the best and the first movie that came out with Mr. Jonathan Frid but this is my opinion.  Long live the Dan Curtis Org. Dark Shadows.<br />(R.I.P- Jonathan Frid Dec.1924-April 2012)
B00729GQ0A|5.0|The story has a nice atmosphere to it - a bit romantic, somewhat touching, dark at times, with the promise of mysteries to be revealed in the offing.<br /><br />Believable description of the Wiccan belief system and practices are a most definitely a plus in a book where the main heroine is a Wiccan - not every author makes the effort, so, kudos. The Elementals are a good, not often used choice for paranormals; it makes the story fresher for a seasoned paranormal fantasy reader. The intertwining of Sophia's previous lives with the present might not be a new idea but it is well executed.<br /><br />There's a decent cast of supporting characters, which for a novel of this size is a must. The main heroine, Sophia, is a little too serious for my taste. Charles, however, does well to offset that with some humor.<br /><br />Many reviewers make allusions to Twilight but in my opinion, the style was closer to True Blood, of which I am a fan.<br /><br />The story is a first-person narration that has plenty of dialog and action. As such it reads easily, I appreciate that.<br /><br />I can see why many readers are so enthusiastic about this book - it's well written with a thought-out and detailed description of the paranormal. Good read.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Perhaps Reacher has come to the end of the road.  The book is much too long on description, short on excitement and missing<br />the slight touch of romance that is in many of his other titles in the series.  It has been a fun ride, but this title lacks<br />many of the good features of his previous books.  Does one really care about the workings of the subway system?  Or are we<br />just filling pages to make a book from a short story?
B004LWZW6U|1.0|They really should let us give movies zero stars, if there ever was a movie deserving o a zero rating it would be this craptacular movie. Was this suppose to be a parody or a sequel??? A good movie for horny teenage boys who want to see Boobs, boobs, and more boobs!!!

0307352145|4.0|Quiet is a wonderfully analytical and insightful book. I loved it so much after reading it on my Kindle that I bought a hardcover edition for my niece, a high school senior. Ms. Cain provides an extremely pursuasive argument for honoring and respecting the 'quieter side' in all of us. The book made my realize how our extroverted culture tends to reward developing our public persona at the expense of developing good character in the privacy of our own quiet side. My only issue with the book is Ms. Cain's extensive use of Asians as her examples of typical quiet people, which seems too convenient and rather judgmental as a stereotype. Asians are certainly not monolithic in their personality traits; they can range from quiet to boisterous too just as everyone else. Perhaps Geert Hofstede's 'power distance' explanations better explain most Asian culture's respect for authority better?

But first, let's briefly discuss the movie itself.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the film yet, you're still probably aware of the polarized reception it received.  Some love it, some hate it.  Instead of giving you another opinion on why it's the best/worst film ever, let me tell you what to expect.  PROMETHEUS is not a horror film.  Certainly it has structural similarities to ALIEN, and there is one scene that I would consider very \\"stressful.\\"  But overall, the film is what I would classify as a \\"concept drama.\\"  That is, a drama that doesn't focus on characters, but rather on concept.  Don't let any of the tense trailers fool you, this movie was meant as a discussion piece, not an adrenaline rush.  You can decide whether it succeeds or fails when you watch it yourself.<br /><br />Onto the discs ...<br /><br />DISC 1 - 3D Blu-Ray (ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE 4-DISC VERSION)<br /><br />A lot of critics commented that PROMETHEUS had some of the best use of 3D they have ever seen.  I don't know that it fully delivered on what I was expecting, but here is my take on the 3D presentation seen on this disc:<br /><br />1) 3D isn't used as a gimmick where things jut out of the screen at you, which is a plus in my book.<br /><br />2) There are a few sequences that look absolutely gorgeous in 3D, usually involving holograms or \\"projected\\" images.  I also think that the medpod scene benefits particularly by the use of 3D.<br /><br />3) I feel like the depth of the 3D was under-utilized.  Almost everyone seems to disagree with me, but I felt that throughout most of the film, the 3D was a bit flat.  That being said, if you prefer 3D, you should get this disc in order to fully appreciate the aforementioned scenes.<br /><br />The image quality was near perfect, and there were no noticeable signs of ghosting on my TV setup.  Audio quality was fantastic, the mix sounded nearly identical to the 2D disc, so I'll comment more on it in my review of that disc.  Subtitles are also included.<br /><br />DISC 2 - 2D Blu-Ray (AVAILABLE IN ALL BLU-RAY VERSIONS)<br /><br />The image quality here is near perfect.  Most important for me are the blacks, which are quite striking on this transfer.  Definite reference quality material here.  As far as audio clarity goes, it's spot on.  The dynamics are up to a bit of interpretation, but it is worth noting that the speakers are seperated with precision.  And there aren't any silly choices made like dialogue coming only from the front speakers, or the back speakers being dedicated exclusively to music.  Subtitles are again included.<br /><br />The primary draw of this disc, apart from the film itself, is the surprisingly large wealth of bonus features.  We have two audio commentaries: one by director Ridley Scott, and one by the writers.  In addition, there are more than 30 minutes of alternate and deleted scenes (although many scenes have incredibly minimal changes) with optional audio commentary, and The Peter Weyland files.  The Peter Weyland files are comprised of four videos (created for the express purpose of promoting the movie) that play very much like deleted scenes or webisodes.  None of the content is necessary to understand the film, but they certainly help give further context and depth.<br /><br />For any casual fan, this disc includes all of the elements comprising of PROMETHEUS's \\"canon.\\"  So unless you want a 3D copy of the movie, or are into bonus features, the standard Blu-Ray release should be more than satisfactory.<br /><br />DISC 3 - Blu-Ray Bonus Disc (ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE 4-DISC VERSION)<br /><br />As far as completionists go, this disc is solid, if not perfect. I was hoping that FOX would come out with an extended cut of the film to be released six months down the road, but this seems to be the definitive home video release for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />The good news is that it's the most COMPLETE wealth of bonus features I have seen since the transition of home video to the Blu-Ray format.  From the \\"Behind the Scenes\\" documentary, which performed beyond my wildest dreams, to an incredibly massive collection of pre-vis sequences, artwork, stills, storyboards, promotional content, and more.  (I love when they're willing to include marketing material like trailers, tv spots, and posters, because those so often shape our opinions of the final product.)<br /><br />So why do I think that the disc is imperfect?  Because there is more content that we were told that we would get that we're not getting.  In an interview, Ridley mentioned at least one deleted scene that we're not getting here.  We were also promised an early version of the script, while the film was still a hardcore ALIEN prequel.  That was supposed to be on the \\"second screen\\" app.  Due to ambiguous legal reasons, that's not happening.<br /><br />(On that note, the second screen app is an interesting idea, but isn't necessary for a complete viewing experience.)<br /><br />DISC 4 - DVD + DIGITAL COPY DISC (AVAILABLE IN BOTH BLU-RAY VERSIONS)<br /><br />This is a bare bones version of the DVD and includes a digital copy. It doesn't include any of the special features that are on the standard DVD release, but those are all included on the 2D Blu-Ray disc anyway. The advantage I see with these combo packs isn't that I need to watch the same movie on a billion different devices, but if I currently have only a DVD player, and plan on upgrading to Blu-Ray eventually, I can buy the special edition now for only a few dollars more than buying the DVD on its own.<br /><br />Both the two and four-disc version comes with an Ultraviolet copy of the movie IN ADDITION to the standard digital copy.<br /><br />[EDIT AS OF OCT. 21st] Some have reported macro-blocking and various other issues with the 2D Blu-Ray disc and the Extras disc.  Not all copies are affected, but if yours is, and you don't wish to exchange your discs, you should be able to fix it by turning off your Blu-Ray player's internet connection.  It apparently has something to do with new copy protection protocal.  In addition, there have been reports of these discs working well after updating the firmware, and/or on different Blu-Ray players.ses available for purchase:<br /><br />1) Standard DVD Version<br />2) 2-Disc Blu-Ray (Standard Release)<br />3) 1-Disc Blu-Ray (Walmart Release)<br />4) 4-Disc Blu-Ray (Collector's Edition)<br /><br />There are also various digital copies available from Amazon or iTunes, but those have been available for some time, and like the standard DVD release, do not come with much in terms of bonus features.<br /><br />[EDIT AS OF OCT. 21st] Some have reported macro-blocking and various other issues with the 2D Blu-Ray disc and the Extras disc.

B004EPZ08O|3.0|This film despite it was only an 90 minute movie seemed to last forever. The accidents were tame and boring and weren't nearly as intense as the fourth not including the opening scene. So if they make another film they have to do way better than this, because this was a disappointment!

B009EHDU7U|5.0|This English version of Jonas Jonasson's Swedish novel was so worth waiting for! The English translation has impeccable comic timing. I was laughing so much reading the novel that my husband demanded that I read it aloud - we then kept grabbing the Kindle from each other to be the one to read. Allan Karlsson boycotts his own 100th birthday party in the old folks' home and takes off. His adventures are absurd, his companions are vividly created characters, including some very funny small time gangsters. Allan is calm and understated as he takes us back to pivotal moments in C20 history and the world leaders he meets. The atom bomb is in it - and you'll laugh, not cry this time. I don't want to spoil the story by naming people and events. I'd be interested in what other readers think of the ending.
B0074JODP8|1.0|Joe does not have a \\"blues\\" voice.  It is pitched too high.  A person is born with good vocal quality, but not Joe.  Rick Melick the keyboard player is useless, especially the lame Hammond solo on \\"Better Watch Yourself\\".  Rick should look at other Hammond organ players such as Chester Thompson, Lucky Peterson etc. The drummer is a rock drummer, wears gloves, what up with that?  Bass player is OK.  Don't buy this dvd, check out The Phantom Blues Band, dvd live with Taj Mahal in St. Lucia.
B000R9NDI0|4.0|I ordered this for my 19 year old son.  He wanted a turntable so I thought what better thing than to introduce him to some great music, the way God intended it to be heard.  Album was in great shape, no scratches -- cover was pristine.  He really liked it, even commented \\"that guy playing guitar, wow, he's pretty good.\\" I'm sure Paul Simon would smile.  Would never fear to order from these guys again.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Simply put, this is a masterpiece. It was no easy task fitting so many superheroes into one movie, and making them mesh and share the screen equally, but this movie accomplished that, and much, much more.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Far above and beyond the typical action adventure hero flick... hmmm, I wonder, does this have something to do with Joss Whedon directing?  Or was it the great writing, or the acting, or the spiney cuttlefish attack vessels from the other side of the universe?

145162607X|5.0|I've read Jean Plaidy's version of this story [[ASIN:0307346153 The Reluctant Queen: The Story of Anne of York (A Queens of England Novel)]] and I'm a big Plaidy fan. I tend to compare a lot of like books to hers and I will say that I liked Philippa Gregory's version of the story of Anne Neville, Anne of York, Richard III's queen just as much as I liked Plaidy's, and in some instances even more.<br /><br />This book starts off when Anne was young and was being introduced to Elizabeth Woodville. This sets a precedent for the entire novel, and is a very different take on Elizabeth than in Gregory's other novels about this same time period. In this one she is a \\"witch\\" and the reason why so much doesn't go right for Anne and her family, according to Anne. Even though a lot of what happens is, obvious to us, not Elizabeth's fault, but those of greedy men.<br /><br />Anne is very much a player in this game. In Plaidy's book she's more of a chess piece and passively goes along with everything, remarking how everything is always so controlled for her. And while Gregory does't have her do anything completely and totally outrageous in this one, she is much less a piece than a player in the game, though to a slightly less degree than Elizabeth, Margaret of Anjou or Jacquetta. She still is very human and very woman for the 15th century. I never felt like she was a modern woman. Did she rail against her fate? Yes, but she never did anything outside the norm for this book to be unbelievable.<br /><br />I also felt that this book pulls a lot of what was happening into focus and still leaves a lot of room for mystery. So far absolutely none of the books solves the mystery of the Princes in the Tower. Everyone speculates, everyone plots. No one knows absolutely everything about anybody.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed this book and cannot wait to read the next one coming down the line. I believe it's supposed to be about Elizabeth of York, Edward IV and Elizabeth's daughter; I feel like that may be the best of all.ke that may be the best of all.

0142420891|5.0|Strange as it sounds, considering no one is fighting for their life in this one (at least physically speaking), I found this book much harder to read than If I Stay. Reading about Adam's struggles in the years since the accident, after seeing what he was like before then, was just heartbreaking. And honestly, even though I liked Mia in If I Stay and was rooting for her, I kind of hated her in this book. Partially because Adam didn't hate her, and I wanted him to. I understood from Mia's perspective why she acted the way she had, but since the story is told from Adam's POV, I just ached for him.<br /><br />And Adam...oh Adam. He was a bit of a knight in shining armor in If I Stay, the kind of character you really need to have a happy ending. But the three years between the two stories have not been kind to him, and he made a lot of bad decisions. I kind of wanted to throttle him in his flashbacks, keep him from going down paths I knew were going to mean nothing but trouble. But I couldn't, and he screwed up over and over, and it was frustrating and annoying and real.<br /><br />The one problem I had with the book, other than that it made me feel feelings I'd rather not have (which, to be clear, means it succeeded), was that while the emotions were extremely real and visceral, the external events were a bit hard to swallow. I had a hard time buying that Adam became a famous rock star and Mia a world-class cellist within the 3-year span following the accident (especially considering the physical rehabilitation Mia would have needed). Is it possible? Yes. People become famous, and people date people that also become famous. But that these people would become famous...I don't know. It seemed like a bit of a stretch. I kind of wish it had been more a case of two people bumping into each other than two famous people being able to follow each other's lives and seek each other out because they are famous.<br /><br />And the only other issue is that after spending the entire book working towards the ending, I was left wanting more. After all those painful emotions, I needed something more to balance it out. But I can't say this is a criticism of the book -- shouldn't all good books leave us wanting more?<br /><br />I'd have a hard time determining whether I preferred If I Stay or Where She Went, because while they feature the same characters in the same timeline of events, they are two very different books. It feels like an apples-to-oranges comparison. So I'll just say that Where She Went, once again, made me have all sorts of feelings, both uplifting and painful, made me connect with realistic and interesting characters, and left me thinking for a long time afterward.book working towards the ending, I was left wanting more.

It is, however, one of the best treatments of the time travel concept that I've seen in a while.

0525953728|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this book and was not disappointed in the least.  It is well-written, interesting, fast-reading and very personal. More importantly for the moment, I did not learn anything from this book of a secret nature that I have not read in many other books, articles, and heard in interviews for a very long time.  The gov't's feigned outrage is nothing more than their typical inept nonsense.  The leader of this country released more classified information to the movie makers and sooner than this heroic author did in his book.

0743487486|5.0|By far the best parenting book I've read.  It teaches you how to be a better parent and create a relationship with your kids that will serve you both in the long term.  It you are looking for a book to get kids to do what you say, skip this and get a book about training kids (or dogs - frequently the same techniques are used).
B007THA4FI|3.0|Unlike most people, I went in to this book knowing that it would be different and VERY different it was......it took me days to finish this book, not because I didn't like it but because it was longer then it need to be and characters/events were usually a couple pages to long.<br />I understand having to explain the backstory and how characters act brutish don't need to hear thirty pages about the fields and how people are to stuck up in their own lives or well-being to care about people that were \\" lower\\" to them. My huge complain this that it was too long.<br /><br />Note: in the e-book version there are chunks missing, something it only a paragraph but other times it up to two pages.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The low-key, matter-of -fact presentation makes the extraordinary events portrayed seem almost commonplace.  In this high-tech age the human factor is sometimes forgotten.  We take for granted the incredible capabilities of the tools of their trade and perhaps think we could have done so well if we had that kind of gear.  Special operators are true warriors who take the fight to our enemies while the rest of us just watch it on TV or read about it in a book.  I salute them all!
B000SEFM6K|5.0|Many other reviews give a synopsis of the plot, so I will refrain. Just say that I had not heard of Wilkie Collins, but he is now my favorite male Victorian author. He was a contemporary and friend of Charles Dickens, however I found the Woman in White much more engaging than most of Dickens' work. A great mystery, romance, wonderful insight into Victorian life.

B008673ZAQ|1.0|I just finished listening to the audio book. I do not understand what has happened in this book and the story of Gideon and Eva. WHERE AND WHEN GOT DERAILED? SO MUCH EXPECTATIONS AND HIGH HOPES BUT ALL TO THE CONTRARY...What a major dissapointment.<br /><br />While reading this book, in my mind, i was repeating to myself...¨Ok,ok, NOW its going to get better...wait wait...now its going to get better, over and over again. guess what? it never happened.<br /><br />i didnt like the story, didnt like the plot, didnt like Gideon's behavior and his lines are awful...is like he was there but he wasnt...and the constant Ï need you¨I breath you¨ï cant leave without you¨..made me so upset, it was way too much make believe. Furthermore, Eva constant crying and nagging...felt like she was trying way too hard. The rest of the characters, just didnt do any justice...and I dont know what people are saying, but it doesnt have lots of sex AT ALL...it does has but not as ¨Bared to You¨.<br /><br />Also, it was too short. I felt the author was trying to finish it in a rush, jumping from one day to another so quickly...for example, Gideon and Eva were away over the weekend and suddenly she was getting ready to go to work... I mean, SHE DID NOT TAKE THE TIME TO ELABORATE MORE AND EXPLAIN IN DETAIL the scenes, what was going on? SO MANY THINGS UNRESOLVED, UNSAID...and THE END IS LIKE ¨COME THE F**** OOOOON!!!! WHAT? ARE YOU FOR REAL?<br /><br />I really hope that MRS. DAY, TAKE THE TIME TO READ AND RE-READ her last installment Ëntwined in you¨(or something like that) to TRY TO revindicate herself. Fifty Shades had major problems, but the story and its characters NEVER EVER DISSAPOINTED ME! in fact, after reading this book I feel the need to go back and start reading ¨FIFTY¨again. At least, they had the whole trilogy available right away and it kept me interested.<br /><br />WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS BOOK? because it DID NOT FULFILL ITS PURPOSE...
B005LAIGSM|2.0|This film truly was a huge disappointment.  I was just expecting so much more.  I spent half the movie wanting to go through the screen and smack her parents.  And then the reason that she didn't talk to them, ARGH!  I just expected this movie to make me feel good and to make me happy.  And it didn't. Rent it folks, don't waste your money buying it.
0385360169|5.0|What can i say....I read the trilogy in FIVE DAYS...it is not LITERATURE, but I love Christian in everyway...The only thing that really  bothered me is that the author repeats herself A LOT.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I had all I could do to get through this book.  I read it because I promised a friend I would.  It is not written well at all.  I found myself just flipping through the pages and skipping some altogether.  Just poorly written and very contrived.  I will say however, the author found a niche' for women and filled it whether I liked it or not.  Kudos to her.

It takes character to write in proper words, it takes a lack of character to write vile language over and over in this book.  I don't recommend it because of its low class language.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|A Wanted Man - the title itself gives a foreshadowing of what happens to several of the characters. As usual, Reacher's big-hearted need to help others puts him in the middle of murder, conpiracy, and danger. Great story. Lee Child's brings his characters to life and makes it difficult to put his books down.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I wish it gave you more coins....cause i want to play this game all the time. Sort fun and realistic.
B009329Y30|3.0|The storyline was okay, but something that has been done before. The characters were not very developed (maybe they are in the book?) and the acting was stiff on Zac Efron's part. The two lead actors/characters did not have much chemistry together. The supporting cast did a good job; especially the little boy, grandma and ex-husband. It wasn't bad for $4 but I wouldn't get it again. The Notebook (another movie made from a Sparks novel) was much better so if you haven't seen it yet I would watch that instead of The Lucky One.

0452289963|5.0|In A New Earth, Ekhart Tolle expounds on his powerful concept of overcoming the ego-driven state of mind. He explains about the ego attachments that may hinder one from attaining the happiness they might be looking for. This book is all about becoming conscious, free of ego-based thinking and reaction, and finding happiness.<br /><br />Ekhart Tolle has a deep understanding of spirituality and he manages to really simplify Eastern spiritual teachings. The `ego' is a complex thing to understand, yet the book elucidates the various ways that it manifests in our lives. Tolle uses great examples of how we are attached to things, and in turn feel pain, anger, jealousy and resentment. Yet he is not saying that you should be indifferent to the people in your life, he is calling for an unattached way of interacting with them. I guess you would need to read this book more than once to really understand what Tolle is passing across.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for those who are looking to understand a different type of spirituality that can be applied in the real world to bring about change. However, this is not a `how to' guide to spiritual enlightenment, it is mainly a narrative backed up by positive theories.
B001HN6922|3.0|Not as entertaining as the first but the kids might still enjoy it. The overall plot was bland and it had a very political agenda feel to it, which I believe has no place in children movies. Both of my kids still prefer to watch the first over the second, but they still watch it on occasion, and even giggle at a few parts in the movie.

0316228532|4.0|I am absolutely a J. K. Rowling fan, having grown up along with the Harry Potter series. I pre-ordered The Casual Vacancy with the highest expectations, and while it certainly doesn't measure up to the Potter series, it's still a great read on its own. The characters were all expertly crafted, and while the plot got a little lost during some parts of the story I still couldn't put the book down. It's a quick, easy read that I'd definitely recommend.

1452110581|5.0|This review is excerpted from a review and Q & A with the author at [...]. The book with the funny title written by the funnier Francesco Marciuliano, hit the New York Times best seller list in September. I Could Pee On This: And Other Poems By Cats is a book of quirky poems \\"written\\" by cats and nicely packaged in hardcover with glossy pages brimming with cat photos. The size, price and appeal makes it our #1 choice for the stocking stuffer gift of 2012. The poems are cute and funny but tinged with the wisdom and insight that only a true cat lover has. I received a review copy of the book. The opinions are my own and I am not compensated for any of my reviews.

B005LAIGZU|1.0|I purchased this movie without knowing to much about it. As I am not an American, I am not so carried away or influenced by the rather patriotic reviews or jingoism that this movie has received. To review a movie as an art form it must have something going for it to make it have the necessary qualities that make a good movie. It must be well crafted, well structured and well acted that tells a plausible story. To engage military personel such as US Navy Seals, and ask them to act out a some what inplausible story line is simply a badly made James Bond movie and is simply risible. The producers would have been better served if they engaged the documentary format. This movie is  contrived nonsense and I am sure that the Seals deserve better. I much regret purchasing the movie.

B009KHDT0C|5.0|Wow! I really like this movie a lot, and will probably buy it. After reading the bad reviews I was hesitant. However, I watched the trailer twice and my gut feeling was that it was right up my alley regardless of what everyone else said. I'm so glad I listened to my gut. I really don't know what people were expecting. The trailer spells it out pretty clearly what kind of movie you're going to be watching, so I don't know how one could be disappointed. The acting was top knotch, and it was very amusing.  I guess everyone is so used to the \\"campy\\" movies fad that it either has to be ALL campy or NONE at all to please those people. Oh well, guess there is something for everyone...and this was definitely for me!! Loads of fun...Go on, give it a try :)
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I had the sample for a while but for some reason it took me a while to read it, I think some of the reviews threw me off, but now that I've read it (in less then 2 days) I loved it! Some of the reviews make the story out to be abusive, but I didn't feel that way at all, yes Travis was a fighter but he never even raised a hand to Abby or any other girl, he was protective and overly loving. I think some if the situations Abby put herself in showed how naive and inexperienced she was, and Travis being older and in a frat knew what kind of people she was dealing with. Long story short, I loved the book, it had a good story with a lot of excitment and a lot of love.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a great getaway from everyday life.  It makes you feel vulnerable and wonder what more could happen in your life or relationship.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|It concerns me that items I list can't be found on the search on this app. Fine on my computer without the app. Plus,  glitchy as far as shipping prices being reflected correctly. Needs more work!
B00846TTDG|1.0|The story line was reasonable, but the acting was so terrible, it was hard to take the movie seriously.<br />Maybe they were real life veterans, and not actors, which makes the idea of this movie legit, but they tried to act, and it was revolting.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|The visual effects were stunning in Blu-Ray, but the story went nowhere - pointless is one descriptive word that springs to mind; another is contrived.  The Promethius plot is what I would expect from a low budget horror movie - this one just has better special effects.<br /><br />I could not identify with any of the characters.  Perhaps it is too much of a stretch to believe that all the highly trained and carefully selected scientists and crew would act like incompetent fools - they seemed bent on their own destruction, without any rhyme or reason.<br /><br />Perhaps the disappointment that the movie ended before the story was over stems from a less than subtle attempt to set the stage for a sequel?  If that is the case, the effective cost of this entertainment is at least double - not an acceptable proposition - a movie must stand on its own, or be marketed as a series.<br /><br />If you want a fun Sci-Fi movie with alien life forms, watch District 9 - that is much more satisfying on so many different levels.

B0098VYCCE|1.0|If you have lots of time to kill and don't mind spend $3.99 on a mediocre movie, then don't read any further. Go ahead...with my blessing. Really.<br /><br />But if you prefer intelligent cinema that at least tries to make a feeble stab at realism, read on.<br /><br />Let's start with the premise: Snow White and the Huntsman is a modern remake  of the classic fairy tale. When you hear of this flick, you might immediately think of the happy-go-lucky, innocent Snow White of Disney fame and assume a 2012 version with awesome special effects might actually have a chance of being interesting. Well, you'd be wrong.<br /><br />For the first fifteen minutes or so, I truly wanted to believe in this story, but the film let me down so far that by the end I was rolling on the floor in a mixture of agony and laughter.<br /><br />The hints at Norse and Celtic cultures used in both the costumes and sets seemed promising. However, the production department just couldn't decide whether this \\"Kingdom\\" was in 14-century France or 8th-century Denmark. The result is a motley visual melee of boots, longbow archers, cleavage-baring dresses with feathers pasted on, and glistening armor that Lancelot himself would have envied.<br /><br />When we first see Snow White, she's a miracle girl born to previously childless parents who can't be more pleased. Why shouldn't they? After all, they got exactly what they ordered--a beautiful, blue-eyed girl with red lips and shiny black hair. She's good, kind to animals and plays outdoors. Young Snow White (Raffey Cassidy) made a credibly beautiful, lively princess. Understandably, I had high hopes for the role of the older Snow White.<br /><br />In keeping with the legend, Snow's mother bites the dust and her father is left suitably aggrieved. Because of his newfound emotions, he's goaded into battle with some mysterious soldiers in a forest. It turns out these soldiers have a `hostage'--Ravenna (Charlize Theron). He's so `fascinated' by her beauty thathe doesn't think twice about her background and brings her to the castle straightaway, Trojan-horse style. After Snow's father has been duped into marrying the lissome blonde, at bedtime she hisses some very unladylike verbiage into his ear then stabs poor King Magnus to death. Evidently his crime was to feel desire for a beautiful woman, which according to the Fem Lit major Ravenna, is punishable by death. Hands off the merchandise!<br /><br />The next segment is quite standard and tired--Ravenna steals the throne, kills all Magnus' nobles and slap Snow White into prison for looking too beautiful. Ravenna's dislike of men doesn't stop her from using her brother as her personal punching bag, either. Theron's performance is OK--with that deep sinister voice, she's maniacal, all right. But we scarcely get a glimpse at her vulnerable side, the side that must have kept her from killing Snow outright in the first place. That's partly due to a script flaw. Horror, pain, suffering, etc, under Queen Ravenna. Yawn.<br /><br />Enter our languishing heroine (Kristen Stewart), who suffers an untold number of years in her lonely tower, watching lovely maidens have the youth sucked out of them by Snow's stepmother, all from a distance. With stringy black hair in a perpetual side-part and eyes that rarely open past half-drugged slits; ridiculous poufy sleeves and rather tomboyish leggings, Stewart's grungy Snow White is far from impressive. You're left asking--this is the fairest of them all? Right. You decide Ravenna really doesn't have that much to be worried about.<br /><br />After mumbling the Lord's prayer (this is a Christian kingdom??) in tortuous English dialects and petting her straw dolls in the shape of her parents, Snow White decides she'd rather not have her youth sucked out, thank you very much. It's jailbreak time. Our innocent-turned-commando slashes her jailer with a rusty nail and flees the castle by executing a perfect softball slide into the underground sewer.Not the most romantic of escapes, but there you are.<br /><br />After diving in to the ocean and avoiding being killed by rocks and surf, Snow White happens upon a horse awaiting her on the beach. (Guess the color of this horse---yep, white.) Interestingly, she has not forgotten how to ride during her long years of imprisonment, and lithely hops on and heads for the dark forest. On the way she rides straight into a bog, inhales a few magic mushrooms and eventually collapses in a writhing ball and passes out in what is commonly known as a side effect of consuming hallucinogenic fungi. Survival school rating: Fail.<br /><br />But wait---we've forgotten the other title character. Dear old Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) is living is squalor, having no other defined skills except drinking and well...the other thing that comes after drinking. He likes to brawl, too, just like a good savage ought. Apparently he is also a tolerably good tracker--just the sort the queen needs. Ravenna's lap dog manages to douse the inebriated Huntsman in ice water and haul him before the royal presence, where he in informed he will have to retrieve the bad little escapee.<br /><br />With the Huntsman's undefined prowess at work, it takes him approximately five seconds to track down Snow, implausibly overcoming a day's gap and miles between him and his quarry. Since the queen ticked him off by mentioning she could resurrect his dead wife as a form of payment, Huntsman suddenly decides he might not finish the job, after all.<br /><br />It's clear that Hemsworth is still in the Thor frame of mind. He swings his axe with the same fervor as he did Mjolnir, expect the Hunstman's axe doesn't shoot lightning or send enemies flying hundreds of feet away. Either of the qualities might have helped the fellow actually win a bout.<br /><br />Even deprived of his usual good-hygiene, Hemsworth is the first appealing character this viewer has seen for the entire film. At last she has a face to pair with the pointless voice-over narration. She can even excuse his attempt at a rather corrupted Scottish dialect and decided mad-on. Why? Because Hemsworth brings something to the screen Stewart can't--chemistry. Despite his best attempts, every romantic scene deadpans out because of Stewart's miserable delivery and lack of a softer side. I don't mean helpless female. I mean feminine. Snow White's mother wanted her daughter to be as delicate and as hardy as a winter rose. That's what Snow should have been, if she hadn't been too busy being caught between Amazon and peabrain.<br /><br />When you take away Snow White's beauty, innocence, and kindness, what do you have left? Answer: a modern-day Boadicea, without the hard past and military skills to back it up. It's a pathetic substitution.<br />If I was a soldier waiting to receive orders from my leader, the last thing I'd want is a harridan in a white nightgown screeching about how excited I should be about assailing an impenetrable fortress. This Snow seems to place zero value on life, unless it's stroking a large stag (white again) beneath a tree covered with sprites. Then she gets to be upsets when some rude twit puts an arrow in it.<br /><br />This stag, by the way, seemed to be an allusion to the Celtic god Herne, though of course no explanation of this factoid is given in the film. One is left to assume the director spent a good deal of time watching The Hooded Man, which would, incidentally, explain the presence of Ray Winstone in dwarven form. Actually, I found the dwarves the most enjoyable group because they could act.<br /><br />I won't even go into the fallacies of the final battle scene that seemed ripped off from Robin Hood, except to point out that Snow, who proclaimed earlier not to hate Ravenna, comes in with sword a-swinging to deal the final blow.  And then, at her coronation, Snow doesn't even give as much as a nod of acknowledgement to the Huntsman. Most women under the age of dead would act like they've been struck by Cupid's Arrow after getting a kiss from that guy. They'd be inseparable. Together forever.  End of story. But all Snow can do is cry and gasp like a fish out of water. Graceful? I think not.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Huntsman wins the Last Man Standing Award. He smiles tolerantly through Snow's screeching speech. He fights for Snow's life time and time again. He's clearly in need of a relationship. Therefore he deserves the hand of the queen if he wants it. But Hemsworth and the scriptwriter make it clear he doesn't.  It makes you want to knock some sense into Snow for dissing Huntsman for wishy-washy William.<br /><br />That's why this story is all about Snow White. She had no fulfilled love interests, no friends and no future. Snow is worse that naïve and impractical--she has no spine. If there ever was a waste of a good legend, it's this one. It could have been a grown-up version of the children's classic--sexy, powerful, emotionally charged. The perfect male lead was there. So was the funding, the CGI, and the scenery. Purely because of Kristen Stewart and a script as flimsy as her fighting skills, Snow White and the Huntsmen falls flat on its face and directly into a mud puddle.
B008FPZQQU|3.0|DVD-Audio (disc 3)<br /><br />Okay, my mistake for not checking the track titles on the DVD (disc 3) and the 2011 remixes (disc 2), but to leave three of the original tracks off the remixes and DVD Audio discs is just nonsense.  The three tracks are The Three Fates: (i) Clotho, (ii) Lachesis; and Tank.  Any die hard ELP fan would be mortified that any re-release would leave out these tracks.  For a starter leaving Clotho and Lachesis off the album is like leaving out the first two movements of a symphony.  I can barely believe Keith Emerson would have approved the omission of the first two movements of the piece.  In my opinion they are integral to the album as is Tank.  The Drum Solo track does not do justice as a substitute for Tank.  It lacks dymanic range compared to the original LP pressing I bought back in the 70s.  And where does Rave Up belong on this album?<br /><br />Other than the fact the producers of this new release must have been on some serious substances when they put it together, the inclusion of the alternate takes of Take A Pebble, Knife Edge and Lucky Man do give an insight of how different the original album may have sounded and are of suprisingly good audio quality considering the takes were destined for the cutting room floor.
B008VBYN80|5.0|hard to get friends on this game.  It is very addicting though.  It would be nice if I didn't run out of energy so fast.
0307730697|5.0|This book is by far one of the best books I've read. Why because its true and shows how someone can fall and The Lord will direct his path when you give your life to Him. My prayer is that The Lord will give me a sermon from it. A back slidden fellow told me about it and said he would come here the sermon if God gave me one. I see this as an open door for God to bring him back. Awesome book I recommend it to everyone

B0060D196K|5.0|In the Victorian era of the United Kingdom, the stingy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) that hates Christmas and people loses his partner Jacob Marley in a Christmas Eve. For seven years, he runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) and spends a bitter treatment to his nephew and acquaintances. However, in the Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed ghost of the chained Marley that tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his miserable youth; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and God bless us everyone, changing his behavior toward Christmas, Bob, his nephew and people in general.<br /><br />This dark adaptation of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickens to the screen is one of those optimistic films that follows the style of Frank Capra's \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and it is impossible not loving it. The redemption of the mean Ebenezer Scrooge in a Christmas Eve is one of the most known worldwide novels and this animation produced by Disney Company follows the style of Tim Burton and may not be the best adaptation to the cinema, but it is indeed effective and a good family entertainment. My vote is five.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|it was incredible, it digs deeper into who Lena was and who she is trying to become. through all of her hard ships and the situations she overcomes is remarkable. Lauren couldn't have written the story any better ,I was almost hoping that the surprise at the end of the book would have been discovered when she was in Julians fathers  study but the ending was so that much better. the only complaint i have is that i have to wait until march to find out what happens !
B003O9I862|5.0|If you like these guys, this is a must get. There are some different takes on great songs and it is interesting to see how the original concepts were polished.
B008UTV43K|5.0|I am very glad I purchased this before I read all the negative user reviews.  This is a fun departure from Diana's previous albums. It absolutely has the strong sonic stamp of T-Bone Burnett like everything he produces, which sounds great on Diana's voice.  This is a bold, innovative, bluesy swingin' ride.  Love it.  Within its style, it demonstrates nice contrast and ample range of moods.  Sonically delightful with T-Bone's signature weighty low end.
B000FA5SMK|1.0|This is the first novel I have read featuring Detective Corey, and will frankly be my last.  I found the plot and actions of the characters to be extremely unrealistic.  The book dragged in so many places, and left me wanting less!  I read the whole book as I hate to leave books unfinished and it helped me fall asleep, but on the whole I thought it was a waste of time.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I loved this book. What a great view on what the lives of witches, vampires and daemons would be like in modern times. It had all the elements of a great book: history, drama, conflict, suspense and of course, unrequited love.<br /><br />Like most other females in 2005 I read the Twilight series and thought they were great, but I thought this take on magical creatures was way better.<br />The storyline was more mature and left out a lot of the immature teenage angst that the Twilight series had. The slight downside of this was that the romance and passion between Matthew and Diana was very subdued in comparison, although still evident.<br /><br />The writing style was very detailed and there were several times when I thought I might need to look up ancient history words or terms that I wasn't familiar with, but was happy when I continued reading slightly on and found that the meaning or definition was woven in to the story through the characters dialogue.<br /><br />Part one of this trilogy is set in more modern times, and from the looks of the sequel it will give a contrast by being set in Elizabethan England, so am looking forward to reading on and comparing the two settings.
B004BQPRNE|5.0|I have seen every Pride and Prejudice that has been made and each brings something to the table, leaving the viewer pleasantly satisfied.  However if one is to compare one version from another in the attempt to settle on a \\"best\\", then I would have to cast my lot in with the 1980 version.  I am passionate for duologue; and  Austin is suburb on that front.  This version is like watching the book come to life; and nothing pleases me more, than when a movie does that.  I highly recommend it, with haste!
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is a MUST  for anyone that loves to listen to AM talk radio day or night  AM radio does not come in well in my area, and if it does, its all static.  This radio APP is great, I can get any number of talk radio stations across the country crystal clear. You can even find your favorite talk radio host and listen to past shows.  Love it.
B009B51K9U|3.0|Sounds like classic green day but new. They have not lost it. Top to bottom great music. Although it is edit versions of songs. Profanity is cut out and for that I only give it 3 stars. I want the real song not the edit version.
B00787IR2Q|3.0|Not sure if the audio problem came from streaming the movie on the internet through Amazon, but it was a huge bummer. It would get really loud during action parts and when dialogue came up, it was barely audible.This movie is fun for the whole family, it has some incredible special effects that for that time were stunners, just know that kids nowadays have seen better cinematographic advances so they might think its cheesy. Anyhow, my kids loved the movie, its funny, quirky, perfect for family night.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is the final book of the three book series of the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. All three books were amazing, but the final book was the best, in my opinion. The variety of different emotions that were drawn out of me throughout this book were incredible and felt so real. Well done, Ms. Collins! Nice piece of work. I hope there will someday be another addition to the series. I highly recommend the whole series for young adults and adults alike.

B009NPKTN6|4.0|So I was really hesitant about watching Rock of Ages--figured it was just going to be really stupid to be honest. On a whim, I decided to rent it. And I'm really glad I did! I was drawn in just from the opening number, and it held me from there. Sure...it's a lot of 80s cheese and big hair...but if you enjoy the music from this era, and aren't looking for anything deep...you'll probably really enjoy this one. Some of the rock mixes were great. I loved how they combined some of the songs. All of the actors just looked like they were having a blast as well.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish it had a LITTLE less of of the very clearly inferred sex (just the way it was done was really in your face), because I would have loved to share this with my 13 year old daughter who is super into music too. I get that the whole premise was rock and roll and sex...but when they several times have characters whipping down their pants, a chick spanking a man bent over a table, another one looking like she is...ahhh...kneeling in front of Tom Cruise's character, and more...it was kind of on the edge for PG13. The main female character ends up being an exotic dancer..yet even those (several) scenes were less in your face (and they had plenty of pole dancing) than some of the other scenes. Again, I do get why it was there..just a side mention of wishing maybe there wasn't quite so much and instead it would have been all the music to make it a tad more family friendly. Since it would be a fun movie to share with your kids to show them what we grew up with, music-wise. I thought the male lead actually had a really good voice, Tom Cruise did a great job, as did Alec Baldwin. I enjoyed the female character (Sherri) for the most part...her voice got on my nerves every once in a while.<br /><br />But...bottom line, if you enjoy 80s music and want a no-brainer, don't expect anything at all deep, just fun hour and a half--give it a try. Well worth the rental price, in my opinion.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle gets better every year and Season 4 is perfect proof of this. So, much drama laced with some clever writing and stellar acting performances. This DVD set should not be missed along with previous seasons. Epic story worth watching from the very first episode to the finale in this set that will have you rewatching the last main scene over and over again!

B0001XAPY2|5.0|This movie, in cartoon form, is one of my favorites. It is very entertaining,humorous,love story,  yet also provides a little history lesson of aviation conditions in Italy leading into World War II. I like the subtitled version which encouraged my children to read. I had seen this movie on TV and liked it so much that I began looking for a place to purchase it.  Amazon to the rescue!
B0077ATSSQ|3.0|Based upon the book, [[ASIN:0547735022 Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (Movie Tie-In): A Novel]] (2005), by Jonathan Safran.<br />The movie begins with Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks) having died in the September 11 World Trade Center tragedy. At the funeral, his son Oskar (Thomas Horn) recalls how his father told him about the five boroughs of New York City, but there was a sixth borough right next to Manhattan. No one knows where it is because it floated away. Oskar wants to find the Sixth Borough and his father gives him a map to search for clues. Central Park is not in the same place it used to be. It was in the center of the Sixth Borough. Enormous hooks were driven deep into the ground and the park was pulled by all the people of New York into Manhattan.<br /> His father mentions one very important clue that a note came from the Sixth Borough.<br />  One year later, he decides to look through his father's wardrobe closet. It had not been touched since that fatal day. Oskar looks for stuff and accidentally knocks over a small blue vase. it breaks on the floor. He discovers a small manilla envelope. There is a key inside.<br />  Oskar begins his journey to find out who the key may belong to and what does it unlock.<br /><br /> Also in the cast: Sandra Bullock, Zoe Caldwell, Max Von Sydow, John Goodman, Stephen Henderson, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright.<br /><br /> While this movie does have its flaws, I do appreciate how the father had every intent of finishing this game out with his son and providing the clues along the way. He was actually trying to help his son find the final clue to the Sixth Borough, but because the 9-year old child was being stubborn and frustrated, the boy didn't find the clue in front of his father. That is what the father wanted was to see his son excited and happy to finally find the final clue, but it wasn't going to happen on that day.<br /> His father had died unexpectedly on September 11, 2001.<br />  All the clues were still in place.<br /><br />Option of Language and Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.br /><br />Option of Language and Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Love this movie! It's a kick butt \\"good guy\\" wins. Predictable, but in a good way. Liam Neeson is his usual laid back yet over the top self.
0545265355|5.0|I loved these stories!!! Lots of action and also romance!! The ending was sort of a surprise, but a good one.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I actually don't know anything about Diana Krall, but I heard a few songs here and was drawn in. All this nonsense about Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra is just that. If comparisons must be made, this record has a 'Julie London does Tin Pan Alley' vibe, and the lady is backed by an absolutely crack band here, especially Marc Ribot on guitar. As usual, T-Bone Burnett does a remarkable job of making things sound contemporary and authentically vintage at the same time. Maybe it's easier for me to take this stylistic leap because I am so unfamiliar with Ms. Krall's other music, but to my ears, this is a damn fine time. A charming record impeccably played and produced.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|.... who sides more with Gideon than Eva right now?? Granted I haven't finished reading Reflected In You. I'm reading it on my kindle and I'm just at about 60% of the book's length. :-) So this is more like a \\"pre/unfinished review\\".<br /><br />****Spoilers....Spoilers.....Spoilers****<br /><br />I know Gideon and Eva are so messed up in so many ways, but we know  as the readers in the romance fiction world- that it is nothing they can't overcome, and that they are so perfect for each other. Sylvia Day has such a powerful way of making that clear in the way she writes, regardless of the main characters' personal demons and troubles. Gideon and Eva NEED to be together, but not only that-- they are MEANT to be together. They're soul mates.<br /><br />The reason I came on here to read some of the reviews rather than go finish the book is I'm frustrated right now- with Eva and the whole Brett Kline part of the story. Am I the only one??? Look, I know Gideon is not being fair to Eva in a lot of ways. He keeps a lot of secrets and it's beyond wrong and hurtful to Eva that he does. That whole Corinne scene where Eva found Gideon's shirtsleeve smeared with red lipstick is driving me crazy. (I'm hoping I find out what that was about before this book ends!) But the thing is, regardless of how secretive and frustrating Gideon is- I know he loves Eva and ONLY Eva. Eva is all Gideon sees and wants, ever, whether they're together or not. Eva constantly says she loves and can't imagine life without Gideon. Her love for Gideon is just as obsessive and intense as his is for her, but then Brett Kline comes along and just like that- Eva felt an attraction to him?! Old boyfriend or not, I don't care. Before he enters the picture, Eva goes on and on in her thoughts as the narrator of this story about how deeply she loves Gideon, can't ever imagine life without him, doesn't ever want to lose him, has never felt this way about anyone in her life, can never get enough of him, is completelyobsessed with him........ the list goes on and on about how much he means to her and the depth of her feelings for him. Yet she sees an old flame and feels a rekindled attraction to him?! Just like that?? What?!<br /><br />The first time around I eventually bought the whole \\"She did it only out of a deep rooted jealousy to get back at Gideon for his secrets involving Corinne\\" scenario, but now where I just left off in the book she saw Brett again- she has lunch with him. Listen- I don't blame her for doing so. Gideon surely deserved that since she just found out he had dinner with Corinne the night before. I don't blame Eva for wanting to make Gideon super jealous again. I don't even blame her for wanting to break-up with Gideon over it because it's all just too painful to take. However, to read her thoughts about looking across the table at Brett during lunch and feeling attraction once again. What the heck??! That I don't get. And to read what she has to say to him when he says he wants to try again with her. The reasons she gives him first aren't anything to do with that she loves Gideon and is devoted to him. No, it was all about why she wouldn't be \\"good\\" for Brett. Eva sounded/came across like a woman who wasn't in love with someone else at all- but rather a woman attracted to the man sitting across from her, though at the same time explaining to him why they can't be together- why it wouldn't work between them- basically because she's a nut case. Eventually she looks Brett in the eye and tells him she's in love with Gideon, but the way Sylvia Day wrote that scene it wasn't all that convincing. I mean, it's clear Eva does loves Gideon, but during that scene it saddened me that Eva comes across as not loving Gideon the way that she'd been feeling, showing, thinking and saying she has for the entire series up until the point Brett came in to the picture.  See.... what I immediately loved about this story, despite the fact that Gideon and Eva are so messed up and there's so much drama/miscommunication between them, is that at and in the center of it all- they truly love one another and ONLY one another. It's an intoxicating, unique, powerful, out of this world kind of love and connection they share. I can't imagine Gideon having one iota of feelings of attraction for any other woman. (There's a difference between finding someone attractive/good looking, and \\"feeling\\" attraction towards another.) And I couldn't imagine Eva having feelings of attraction for any other man, but then Brett Kline comes along and she did. Eva felt an attraction twice in regards to Brett. At the concert, and at lunch. And now I feel like Arnoldo did after the concert- like she sort of isn't good enough for Gideon after all. Gideon deserves to be loved back the way he loves, and right now, at 60% of the book, Eva doesn't seem to love him quite as much as he does her. I hate that. That's a pet peeve of mine when I read love stories. I mean, I know that she loves him so much, but geesh every time she sees Brett she feels something for him. Granted it's only a spark of attraction, not love in any way, but so what?! It's not right. Doesn't fit with the way she and Gideon are portrayed to crave and love one another in the books up until Brett's character enters.  Up until that point Sylvia Day makes it crystal clear that Eva loves Gideon so intensely (and he her in return), but then when Brett is in the picture that intensity seems to falter a little bit where Eva is concerned. That didn't happen to Gideon when Corinne appeared. No doubt as a man he appreciates Corinne's beauty, but that's it. For Gideon it's all about and ONLY about Eva. No one else- no matter how attractive or beautiful- can make him feel a spark of anything. Only Eva. And even though it's obvious Gideon is who Eva loves deeply- the only man she's ever loved- it really sucks that now the same can't be said about her anymore. :/<br /><br />What I love about the 50 Shades Trilogy most of all has nothing to do with the sex/bdsm scenes- it's that Christian and Ana only love and have eyes for each other. They're wrapped up 100% solid in each other. They may see lots of attractive people around them and at times acknowledge that they are in fact attractive, but that's where it ends. Their feelings for each other are so deep, so true and addictive that neither of them not only would never, but simply could never feel a spark or attraction toward anyone else. That's how solid and perfect their love is. That's how Gideon loves Eva. And that's how Eva should love him back, no matter what or who shows up. No matter if they're together or if they're broken up because Gideon's being an ass. :-)<br /><br />Okay- I'm done with my rant. Lol! Back to finishing the book. I still love this series Sylvia Day has written, and can't wait for the 3rd/final book in December. I know that in the end- Gideon's and Eva's love for each other will be equally beautiful, deep and ever-lasting. BUT I have a feeling we haven't seen the last of Brett..... and I'm okay with that actually. Just please Ms. Day- this time, let the attraction be one sided- coming from Brett's side only, not Eva's.<br /><br />Just like it's only Eva for Gideon all the time, it should only be Gideon for Eva all the time.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This is another great saga by Ken Follett.  I love reading his books because the characters and the stories simply draw you in to the point where you cannot put the book down.  I am starting to tire of his \\"socialist\\" lean to the stories and the characters.  The lean seems to get stronger and less transparent with each new book.  This will probably be the last  book of his that I will read.
B00760BPOC|5.0|The author has managed to keep alive  many characters who are so vibrant and so  human! I love the mix of the different genres as well.
0307720950|5.0|Rare that someone can call a historical moment when it's happening, but he does.. anyone who wants a path out of the economic insanity should read and ingest the messages in this book.. the entire paradigm has changed and he lays it out. If you want off the rat race, you want this book.  I'd often thought that the solution to big corporation running factories were lots of small ones linked by the net.  He lays that out in great detail, and it really is the wave of the future.  The old ideas are toast.. if your floundering around trying to figure out the future, I like his.. He's a little thin on how your going to make money on your ideas or protect them... I tend to disagree with a bit of what he said, but all in all a fantastic inspirational book!
B0093DNRY6|5.0|Brilliant is right.  What a sound!  Sounds to me like a brain buzzing after an especially large dark roast.  What great ideas these guys have.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|This movie was mediocre, by far the worst of the trilogy.  The first 2 were as grounded in \\"realism\\" as you can get for a Batman movie.  This movie was sloppy, had more plot holes than I could count.  Was so disjointed and messy.  Nolan just mailed it in with this movie.  Just blah...and doubt I'll ever watch it again.  One of the biggest disappointments I've experienced in movie history.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|it is pretty mundane but its fun and i need to slow down after solving all the worlds problem for the day
B009B50QOU|5.0|All the quality expected from a solid group, great album! Just like all the classic Green Day I've come to expect!
B002ZG9846|5.0|Probably the most surprisingly entertaining film I have seen in a long time.  There was virtually no marketing hype for this film during its theatrical release so I had no idea what to expect when I actually saw the film.  Note: as others may have stated, this is not for those who are offended by potty mouthed young characters, or who are planning to watch this movie with little children.  My only ding for the product, and not on the movie itself, is that the included digital copy was past its expiration date and I was therefore not able to load the content into the HD of my computer.  Since I paid less for this package than I did the original DVD for the movie, I'm still quite happy with my purchase.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would recommend this to my sister and my  mother.  also any  women married for more than five years! enjoy!
B009HSVHV2|4.0|this cd is alot like animalize for me in that I like it more everytime I listen to it. I can dig that kiss wanted to go heavier then Sonic Boom and this isn't a sell out of an album. I do get tired of everyone saying thier a tribute band because ace and peter aren't in the band well i have sdeen then 26 times and if the original lineup would have stayed sober and so forth then they would be together tommy and eric do a great job so get over it people have an open mind when u listen to Monster  it gets better everytime
B00992CF6W|5.0|alright this game has given me the chance to play minecraft on the go. I have been playing it for so long ever since I got the game. MC gives me something to do when my friends are playing it when I don't have a computer. so ya get this game it is worth the $7.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought the book was well written and captivating till the end. I <br />just couldn't put it down. Loved it!

0345803485|1.0|To call 50 Shades of Grey \\"book porn\\" really isn't too far off. Long story short; this is a book...but it's certainly not one that will interest you in it's story. This book relies almost entirely on descriptive eroticism and fetishism to interest it's reader at all.<br /><br />James' strengths as a writer clearly come less from her ability to create interesting characters or a cohesive plot line, and more from the ability to use a thesaurus. While writing this, I can't help but imagine that she had one always open for his long, drawn out, and eventually mind numbing graphic sex scenes. This is, by all means, not a book that appeals to people's intelligence but rather a book that relies on greasy sex and the baser instincts of human beings.<br /><br />The entirety of this book's plot can be summed up in the sentence \\"Girl meets rich man and they have kinky sex\\".<br /><br />In a world where so many terrific novelists and writers are struggling to get their work to the public, it is disgusting that something as base as this is being glorified. This is book porn for lonely housewives. I would call it \\"Twilight for 30-somethines\\", but in all honestly the Twilight books are far more creative than this garbage...and that is something I never thought I would say.<br /><br />I have nothing against pornography...but this greasy stuff should be kept in it's own section away from books that require a brain to read.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This thing is everything I thought is was going to be! Gruesome, gross, and downright AWESOME! I haven't opened mine yet, but my buddy got one and I was able to check it out! Screwdriver while sending this undead horror back to whence it came also serves as a locking mechanism that when pushed in fully, locks the head down and keeps your blue rays safely inside! I swear this must be the zombie \\"Andrea\\" killed in the second season inside the camper in exactly the same fashion. My reason for not opening it yet is simple, its a limited edition, and Netflix now has the second season up for streaming, so there is no need for me to open it and possibly devalue it! If you can still get one at a similar price to what Amazon had it for, go for it!
B008PE9GSA|4.0|I purchased this CD from Amazon out of loyalty to one of my favorite groups.  I had read a newspaper review that stated it was good, up to date, but still held on to that singular ZZ style.  So I gambled a little and brought it in.  I think that three of the tunes were just great and I was glad to see that they gave a nod to La Grange and others with a riff or two.  Couple of plaintive songs that were very pleasing.  This showed me that ZZ has plenty of stuff left in their pipeline and hopefully they will stay on the scene with even more of this.  They proved that you could keep ahead of the curve and still maintain their identity. The bad news is that the CD is stuck in my car stereo and I can't play it or get it out.<br />Dick Urban  Houston Texas
B00908DDZM|5.0|I know people get all upset about editing art, but it's nice to have the radio edit for DJing teen dances and driving around with kids in the car. If you need more curse words in your life, grab the deluxe version of the album off of iTunes.

B004WGIXX4|5.0|A nice feel good movie. I didn't agree with the poorer reviews at all. It was warm, well thought out and well directed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Having seen the preview for the movie, I couldn't decide on whether or not to read the book.  However, I figured that if I didn't like it or couldn't get into it, I could simply stop reading it.  Well, I couldn't put it down...Looking forward to reading the next one in the series.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This conclusion to Ana and Christian's love story is so beautiful.  Definitely worth reading more than just the titillating first book.  So satisfying to see how both characters grow, change, and move into a fully healthy and happy relationship.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As usual, Ken Follett  has written a great book!  A must read, especially after reading \\"Fall of Giants\\". Already looking forward to book three.
B008OJ291W|5.0|I've been an ELO fan since I was 12, I've got all of their albums framed and up my living room wall. I was really excited to hear that Jeff Lynne was finally putting out some new music. Although I was a bit disappointed when I heard there wasn't going to be much new material, I must say that his final products are fantastic!<br /><br />These versions sound like the originals, just a lot clearer, and crisper. Having heard the originals hundreds of times, there are a few notable differences. Don't Bring Me Down sounds a lot more \\"guitar driven\\" than the original, which caught me off guard, but really works. Can't get it out of my Head, Strange Magic, Turn to Stone, and 10538 Overture sound better than the original in my opinion. Point of No Return is a hopeful sign for things to come, with his next release.<br /><br />I must say I do miss some of Kelly Groucutt's vocals (especially on Telephone Line) on some tracks, but all in all, it is a fantastic album with brilliant songs that will appeal to a new generation.
0385344228|4.0|This is a very well-done crime story/courtroom drama/psychological novel. The story is told from the point of view of an Assistant District Attorney whose 14 year-old son has been accused of the murder of a classmate. Partly told through flashbacks and courtroom transcripts, the story keeps you intrigued and guessing through the very last page. The one drawback for me is that, since the story is told entirely through the eyes of the DA/Father, the other characters, including his wife and his son Jacob, never completely come alive. Nevertheless, a very good read!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I love this app, but the latest version downloaded from Amazon does not work!  Please refresh the source package plz!
1451627297|2.0|A wonderful idea turns into a bloated excess. Stephen King needs an editor with balls who will tell him when enough is enough! Protagonist travels back in time to foil JFK's assassination. But he does so several times and takes several side trips. It takes 800 pages to get to 11/22/63 and then he wraps it all up in less than100 pages! Pretty much a disappointment to this King fan who has read ALL his books!
B008LZYR0A|3.0|Having loved Neil and Chris for years now, i have mixed feelings about WINNER and their new CD as well.  the song is fruit from the olympics and has its moment in history.  it will lead you to purchase the new CD and find that the songs on the new CD are much better, crisper and well worth the price.  The CD has a California sound to it and is one notch better than RELEASE.  But with all the retrospectiveness of this CD, has the fun left PSB?
B008RTE08E|5.0|This review is for the 2012 Apple release of \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\" We finally have a proper DVD version of this 53 minute Beatle film from 1967. While previous releases were muddy in both picture and sound, we now have a crisp clean print with great sound to match. The 5.1 DTS is especially impressive. Paul's bass on \\"I am the Walrus\\" sounds as if he's playing in the room with you. Anyone who has seen this movie knows that the story sections are at times meadering and unfocused, but it's still fun to see the boys goofing around. The real reason for getting this DVD is of course the music. Six great Beatle tunes and a campy cameo by The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band performing \\"Death Cab for Cutie\\" make this a worthy purchase. There are also many extras including a making of documentary and \\"new\\" cuts of three of the songs created from outtake footage, a deleted musical scene featuring a young Stevie Windwood and Traffic and a rare BBC promo film of \\"Hello, Goodbye\\"  Bottom line: If you love The Beatles then this new release should be a part of your collection. Just be sure you're buying the 2012 Apple version.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|George Harrison fans MUST own this product.  Olivia did a fine job presenting George in all respects to his life and music.  So with the purchase of this package, you help Olivia and Dhani stay in Friar Park and pay the bills.  Peace.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Bought this is a do-all survival knife to take camping, hunting, and hiking, and I love it!  You can buy knives with a nicer fit and finish and with more durable coatings, but definitely not for this price.  At less than 40 dollars, I will never feel guilty about beating the crap out of this knife, and it's such a strong, thick piece of steel that I believe it will withstand a lifetime of abuse.<br /><br />I have pretty average size hands for a guy, and I appreciate the positive grip and control I get from the fat, contoured handle.  People who like the skinny handles of some Cold Steel and some Fallkniven products may find this handle a little bulky.  The grip is great, the ergonomics are good, and the knife performed great for me for chopping, batoning, and even surprised by how well it made feather sticks.<br /><br />My opinion - you can't go wrong with this one!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I'm speaking of course of Lee Child and his absolutely fabulous main character, Jack<br />Reacher. I'm hooked absolutely. Do yourself a favor - read this book. You will be hooked too!

The mixture between color and black & white photos was a great balance and treat for my senses. Having information on the dogs makes it more relatable, too. I proudly support what his goal is for.

Some of them are really difficult, so it had us thinking pretty hard.<br /><br />Very addictive and fun to play.<br /><br />Easy levels are great for anyone who doesn't have experience working with logic puzzles.<br />Hard levels are great for fine-tuning and honing your logic puzzle skills.

B004SRNH10|2.0|The only reason I installed this app is because it is required for WatchESPN and a few other apps. It is an Adobe app so of course it will crash sometimes but is more stable than Flash.
0394800184|5.0|My daughter really enjoys this book. I'm not sure if its because it's about a lost baby bird or the fact that the bird really wants to be with his mama, but she seems to be able to comprehend the feelings between a baby and their mama.<br />I read it to her almost every day.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Before I saw this film, I had my doubts.  I am not really a person who is in to these movies where some vindictive guy runs around killing everybody.  But, Taken is so much more than that, and Liam Neeson is amazing as a father and an assassin in this movie!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Did not like the ending. It leaves the reader hanging.     <br />The plot seems unresolved.  I would not recommend this book.
