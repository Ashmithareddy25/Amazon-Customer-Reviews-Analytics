B000YABYLA|5.0|I thought this movie was just a great piece of light-hearted cinema.  Although the slang is a little dense (and frankly some of it is just weird, but maybe that is because I am 25 years old and already out of the loop), Ellen Page totally entranced me.  She was compelling and believable as the quirky, yet still naive girl in over her head.<br /><br />My favorite part of the film is the beginning: Rainn Wilson is just great in that little role.  The line, \\"it started with a chair\\" was so intriguing.  And her sitting in the living room set outside Bleeker's house with the pipe in her mouth was priceless!<br /><br />Give it a shot and enjoy yourself.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|To be honest, after hearing that Madonna had teamed up with Timbaland, I was rather apprehensive about the release of \\"Hard Candy\\".  Admittedly, I am not entirely a hip-hop fan, although I did enjoy the album \\"Loose\\" by Nelly Furtado, also produced by Timbaland.  \\"Hard Candy\\" was released a day earlier in South Africa (Sunday, 27 April) and, after listening to it, I can only say that Madonna has definitely exceeded my expectations.  In fact, to be honest, the last album that made me smile this much was an album released almost two decades ago - \\"Like a Prayer\\".  I could perhaps also throw \\"Ray of Light\\" in here too.  Although Madonna has scored some major hits since \\"Like a Prayer\\", like \\"Vogue\\", \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Frozen\\", \\"Ray of Light\\", \\"Music\\" and \\"Hung Up\\", she has not since then produced an album as exhilarating as this.  I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\", but there were only really three or four potential singles from that album.    \\"Hard Candy\\", I can assure you, contains at least six potential singles, and that is no lie.  I don't quite think it was accurate to describe \\"hip-hop\\" as the main influence on this album.  Sure, there are definite hip-hop stimuli, but fans both old and young will find the material far more dance-oriented than it has been made out to be.  In fact, there is something for everybody on \\"Hard Candy\\".  Some tunes have a definite 80's groove, 70's disco and stomping 90's dance.  Madonna has certainly proven her staying power with this album.    The album opens with the tune \\"Candy Shop\\".  With no disrespect at all towards Madonna, this sounds very much like a track from Nelly Furtado, from her album \\"Loose\\".  The song is definitely not the strongest on the album, but is indeed catchy with repeated lyrics declaring 'Sticky and sweet, sticky and sweet'.    \\"4 Minutes\\" was for me personally, a bit disappointing.  I suppose I expected a bit more for a first single release.  However, it has proven popular on the world charts, reaching the top 3 in more than 30 countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, South Africa and France.    The third album track, \\"Give it to me\\", really put a smile on my face and will put a smile on the world charts too.  It is undeniably catchy - a stomping dance track with a beguiling chorus that sticks permanently in your head.  This is a definite third or fourth single release and will likely be a huge hit.    \\"Heartbeat\\" mixes hip-hop with both 80's synth and early 90's trip beats.  Not a possible single, but the track is honest, in your face and hummable.  Madonna also tests the upper realms of her pitch potential, and succeeds with ease.    \\"Miles Away\\" - oh wow!  Beautiful guitar, deep grooves, alluring lyrics and oh so captivating.  This is Madonna at her poetic best!  'You always love me more...miles away' is clearly an ode to her sometimes long-distance relationship with Guy Ritchie.  This begs to be released as a single.    \\"She's Not Me\\" is a dig at some floozy who has clearly upset Madonna enough to proclaim that 'she doesn't have money; she'll never have what I have'.  However, this description in no way illustrates what a breathtaking track this is - single number three or four without a doubt.  This track sounds like something that could belong on a 'teen movie' soundtrack, especially towards the middle when we are greeted by a bubblegum, up-tempo surprise.  It has incredibly catchy lyrics and the bassist deserves a gold medal.  This is yet another stomping club track and fans of European singer, Mika, will also be very impressed.  However, Madonna makes this 'single' her own.    \\"Incredible\\" is a synth-based, hip-hop-mixed, fresh tune.  Definitely not a single but, again, could likely become catchy with time.    \\"Beat goes on\\" is, for sure, single release number two.  What a fantastic job Madonna and Kayne West have done on this track.  I'm apt to say that this is my favourite track on the album, and my favourite in many years.  The chorus is so captivating, I have no doubt in my mind that this will be Madonna's biggest number one for many years.  It's a beautiful dance groove that can simply be described as \\"mesmerising\\".  If I do dare criticise this track, it would have to be the minute-long \\"rap\\" in the middle of the song, which appeared to be out of place.    The remaining four tracks, \\"Dance 2Night\\" (reminds me of Wham's \\"Young Guns (Go for it)\\", \\"Spanish Lesson\\" (the weakest track), \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and \\"Voices\\" can mostly be regarded as pleasing.  The only possible single release here though would be \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognise You\\", a catchy ballad that gets better with each listen.    Well done, Madonna.  She will indeed surprise many, many people with this album.  This album might not be regarded as Madonna's best, but it certainly beats \\"Bedtime Stories\\", \\"Music\\" and \\"American Life\\".  It has come at the right time, and is polished, immaculate and enthralling.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|To hell with the likes of Mariah Carey, Rihanna, and Christina Aguilera: Madonna is and always will be the hottest female artist on the music scene. (Can you believe she's almost 50 years old?!) I didn't think the Material Girl could possibly top her last album, \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" (which is probably my favorite Madonna album of all time), but I was wrong! \\"Hard Candy\\" is every bit as fabulous as I hoped it would be, and it's Madonna's sexiest album ever.<br /><br />When I listened to \\"4 Minutes,\\" the album's first single, I thought \\"Hard Candy\\" would have an overall hip-hop flavor to it. Luckily, I was wrong. Madonna's duet with Justin Timberlake is good, but it doesn't even begin to compare to the other tracks on this CD. \\"Hard Candy\\" is more of a dance album than anything else, with traces of electronica and, yes, a bit of hip-hop to boot. But have no fear, hip-hop haters of the world: This CD is awesome! It opens with \\"Candy Shop,\\" a breathy pop number that sets the tone for the rest of this sexy album. \\"Give It 2 Me\\" is a fantastic dance track that's all about girl power. Other highlights include \\"Miles Away,\\" which Madonna says was inspired by the difficulties of maintaining a long-distance relationship with her husband, Guy Ritchie; \\"She's Not Me,\\" a story of two women competing for the same man; \\"Incredible,\\" my favorite track on the CD, which starts off as a bittersweet recollection of a former lover and quickly turns into a frantic craving for sex; \\"Dance 2 Nite,\\" a slinky, mellow little number; and \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You,\\" a sad reflection on a relationship gone wrong.<br /><br />I cannot get enough of this album! It's energetic, powerful, and soulful...concrete proof that Madonna just keeps getting better and better! Run out and buy this CD so you can hear the magic for yourself.
0452289963|3.0|I am an avid reader and was very excited to finally get to read this well-touted book.  I found his ideas solid, but nothing that has not already been brought forth in other reading.  After a while, I had a hard time perceiving his picture of a \\"pain body\\". I would not give my pain (any of them, as I have quite a few at my age)the right to be known as a pain body.  They are just part of my present body and I work around the pain.  I take few pills, so I recognise each pain and put it in its place.  Finally, I had to put the book down and will continue it at another time. It did not give me a \\"change\\".  I guess I have changed over the years and see my self in a more positive, non-judgemental way. I find joy in each day and see the world around me as a gift from God.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|New York resident Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) has been offered a job in Japan, but before going on his trip he has planned a party with his friends like his girlfriend Beth (Oddette Yustman), his brother Jason (Mike Vogel), Jason's girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas), best pal Hud (T.J. Miller) and party animal Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) invited. During that night as they are having a great time especially using a DV camera to film the going away party their fun is suddenly is interuppted by a horrifying incident going on in the city as they flee out as they film what is going on. A hideous giantic monster of unknown origin attacks the big apple as now our five friends must flee the city, try to stay alive and find out what the military is up to all recorded on a camera.<br /><br />Stylish and original Sci-fi horror thriller from J.J. Abrahams (\\"Transformers 2007\\" and \\"Lost\\") is one of the most unique and stunning films in recent memory. It uses a mockumentary-esque feel to it and makes you feel like your part of the movie too with it's DV camera filmmaking and good performances by the cast. This movie plays as a semi-realistic homage to the monster movies of yore and Japan of course, the film is kind of gory at times for a PG-13 rated movie and it's a heart-pounding and suspenseful shocker that never lets go. The monster designs are quite cool even with the little parasitic creatures, this movie launched a major hype campaign before it was released thanks to a clever teaser and movie poster. The film became an instant success and got some critical acclaim, i can't wait for the sequel coming out next year.<br /><br />This DVD has some good extras like Widescreen presentation, audio commentary from the director, deleted scenes, alternate endings, outtakes, The Making of Cloverfield featurettes, and hidden research into Case Designate Cloverfield.

B000UBMWG4|3.0|My review for Blade Runner is just for the Final Cut version.     I am 25 years old and had never seen this film; people always follow this by asking me where I have been for all those years!    Well actually waiting, waiting for the right time to watch it. Then one day I find out that this film is coming to Blu Ray and after release, I order off Amazon and a week later sit down in front of my 42inch Full HD 1080P LCD TV to watch the awesome Blade Runner!!    With years of people nagging at me to watch this great film, I sit ready to be blown away for what I presume will be the most epic film ever!    Then the film starts, EPIC EPIC EPIC is all I see, reminding myself how old this film is, every scene is garnished in fine quality and art. My jaw still on the floor, realising that this film was made years ago yet feels that is was done last year.    When the film was over, I felt something that I really did not want to feel, I was disappointed. Do not get me wrong, this film is a beautiful and will be in my honoured collection of films but it would fall under my arty category. The best way I can describe this to you would be that for such an epic feel, the story was claustrophobic. I am sure the idea was ahead of its time but let's just say. My expectation was put so high that I expected something else.    My best advice for the readers is, if you're into artistic, futuristic worlds then this film is defiantly for you! 4 out 5!    I gave it 3 out of 5, for personal feeling of the film. I just wish maybe I could have experienced this film when it was first released, in a time where films liken this would have blown my mind.    Hope that review makes sense! Thanks
B000F0UUT6|4.0|This is a great product, especially for Jane Austen fanatics like myself.  The only thing I was disappointed with was in the extra disc, none of the really important main characters are featured.  It would have been interesting to see what they thought about the movie and to get their take on everything.  Other than that it is fantastic.  The biography portion is interesting and the book with all of the pictures from the making of the movie are fun.
B00004Z4SD|1.0|We purchased three videos to be given to friends and the sound quality, unless the camera is close to the subject, cannot be heard. I am very sorry I purchased the videos.
0380820846|2.0|The other Bridgerton books were awesome. Julia Quinn is my favorite romance author and head & shoulders above the usual garbage out there.  I was SO disappointed by this book.  Sorry, but listening to Colin whine about the fact that it's not fair that he doesn't have a purpose in life is just stupid.  Wah, wah.  He comes off as a big whiny bug.  The discovery of who is Lady Whistledown is anti-climactic and then to listen to Colin whinge about the fact that Lady Whistledown is a published author and he isn't is, once again, just tiresome.  The romance side of things is pretty bland.  I guess if you want to read the entire series, you have to get through this one, but don't read this one first!  I can highly recommend the rest of the books, however!
1592401791|3.0|Some of the accuracy of the information recalled in this book has been called into question by another Abbey Road staff member who was there at the time as well. Even taking into consideration the possibility that there may be factual errors, it's still enjoyable to read about the experience from Mr. Emerick's point of view. I find the meticulously accurate information in \\"Recording the Beatles\\" (by Brian Kehew and Kevin Ryan) to be indispensable, however \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" has the element of personal experience that makes it charming, taking the reader back in time.
B00005JLT5|4.0|A wonderful story of compassion and caring by a German Captain.  A Polish Jew by the name of Szpilman is repeatedly given safe passage as the German war machine takes over much of Europe.  While many Jews sheepishly awaited their fate, Szpilman used his pianist fame to evade death.    He nearly runs out of luck when the Germans set up post in a house he's hiding in.  When the commanding German officer discovers Szpilman, he tells him to play the piano.  Szpilman performs a wonderful tune on the piano.  The Captain responds with compassion, giving Szpilman food and even the coat off his back.  Unfortunately, the German Captain falls into the hands of Russians and, presumably, dies in their captivity.    In summation, a story of survival during this most difficult of wars.  A German and a Jew sharing a moment of joy amidst hard times.  Who would have imagined?    Not for children under age 10.  Contains violence and harsh language.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Okay So I Will Say at first I was skeptical about this album. I mean I love the Lead single 4 Minutes, but I thought Justin took over the song a little much, but this is no reflection on the entire album. The album is absolutely incredible. It truly is what Confessions promised to be; a total dance album.     1) Candy Shop: The lead-off song. This song is really catchy. It's simple and sweet with lots of inneundos. It sets a good mood for the whole album.     2) 4 Minutes: You Know This One     3) Give It 2 Me: One of the best songs on the album. This song really portarys the early 80s NYC sound you would find in clubs. Madonna really \\"Gives it to\\" us here.     4) Heartbeat: This song is classic Madonna. It has a great pop sound to it.     5) Miles Away: A Great song about Madonna's relationship with Guy. It begins with an Acoustic guitar opening and then morphs into a great dance track.      6) She's Not Me: This song is really hot. It's Madonna at her edgy best. It's reminds me of an updated version of Theif of hearts. Hot beat and hot lyrics make this single material. Total hit here.    7) Incredible: I must say I did not like this song when I first heard it, but it has grown on me a lot. It's another classic M Pop song and I love the break-down.     8) Beat Goes On: Wow this is total single material. The 80's club sound works perfect and during Kayne's rap you will feel like Madonna was channeling \\"Bad Girls\\" while working on this one.     9) Dance 2Night: Another Madonna/Justin Duo. Although this one is by far superior to 4Minutes. It's a great dance track with a catchy lyrics. I love the fact that Madonna has control on this track unlike \\"4 Minutes\\"    10) Spanish Lesson: My least favorite song on the ablum. Altough I am not that fond of it, it's still not horrible. I think Madonna was trying to channel a new song simmilar to the remix of La Isla Bonita she perfomed at Live Earth. It's basically Madonna giving a \\"Spanish Lesson\\" to a student. It has some innuendo but not as much as \\"Candy Shop\\"     11) Devil Wouldn't Reconigze You: This is a classic Madonna song. It's the closet she has came to a Classic M ballad since \\"You'll See\\". Despite this being closer to the ballad side, you can still dance to it.     12) Voices: Another Madonna/Justin Duo, with quite a dark mood. It's total oppistie to the opening of the album. While this is not my favorite song, it's still fairly good and worth giving a listen to.     13) Ring My Bell (For Those Who Bought the Pre-Order Deluxe): This song ranks with \\"Spanish Lesson\\". It's okay, but I am glad it did not make the final cut.
B000P12LWY|4.0|I am a huge fan of Tudor history and was therefore excited when I heard about the series.  I found it to be highly entertaining albeit VERY historically inaccurate.  I think I was annoying my husband when I kept quipping \\"that's not actually what happened!\\"  Having Henry Fitzroy die as a child of only 3 or 4 as opposed to a teenager, showing no affection between Katharine of Aragon and Henry VIII and making Katharine so much older than the Henry in this series, muddling the time frame on his affair with Mary Boleyn and then Anne (not to mention the whole annulment proceedings) and changing the story-line of Henry's sister(s) are only to name a few.  I think serious scholars of Tudor history would find this series downright laughable.<br /><br />BUT, if you go into it knowing that the writers and directors have taken numerous (and I mean numerous) liberties and you are OK with the fact that it is highly akin to a soap-opera/romance novel (complete with bodice ripping scenes), then I think you will find that it offers some entertainment value.<br /><br />I do think that the \\"cheese factor\\" could have been toned down just a tad.  For example, I don't like how the opening credits roll showing each actor with their name in text appearing next to their faces.  There are a few other instances where I felt similarly..but, as I previously mentioned, this series is very similar to a soap-opera so I suppose some \\"cheese\\" is to be expected!<br /><br />Finally, I do love the costumes and the set design.
1577314808|2.0|I listened to this book on CD.  At first I thought it was pretty good stuff until a woman basically asked Tolle, \\"How do I use your teachings when I have overwhelming problems like debt, a son on drugs, going through a divorce, etc.\\" Tolle answered with in my opinion a nonanswer.  I don't remember the exact words nor do I wish to but he basically said well I understand how difficult it is but just think in the now and everything will be okay.  I think if you are into this stuff then you should read the stuff by J. Krishnamurti or even Dr. Wayne Dyer.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|This is power metal as it should be. Watching Kamelot rocking on stage is a much superior experience to listening to the CD. The filming was beautifully done, capturing the mood perfectly. There is a story line to the show and the band moves from song to song effortlessly, keeping the excitement up even in the slower numbers like 'Abandoned'. Kahn's duet with Simone Simons of Epica on 'The Haunting' is flawless. Simone has such a charismatic stage presence at times it seems she might very well upstage Kahn!   Not since Queen's Live at Wembley had I enjoyed and rocked so much to a live concert. Kamelot prove that they are the masters of their trade and this concert might very well go down as one of the defining moments of their history.  Get it and rock your way to a great time.
B00005R5G9|3.0|The audio mixing is poorly done. For instance; the voices of the actors are barely audible so you turn up the volume. The next scene kicks in with a music intro and you are blown out of your seat because now the volume is too loud. Back and forth like this through the whole movie.
B000M343BM|5.0|I love this movie, I really do. MAJOR LEAGUE, to me, hasn't lost an iota of its watchability factor. The uproarious humor, sometimes verrrry salty, still cracks me up. The underdog theme still gets me cheering wildly. Its unexpected moments of poignancy, still heartfelt. The big game at the end, still ridiculously stirring. In terms of its place in my personal hierarchy of baseball flicks, this one ranks right up there with [[ASIN:B000MNOX94 The Natural (Director's Cut)]], [[ASIN:B0010YSD8Q Bull Durham (20th Anniversary Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0010YSD9A The Pride of the Yankees (Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0001GF2CE A League of Their Own (Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:078322611X Field of Dreams (Widescreen Two-Disc Anniversary Edition)]]. Add in a low key but engaging romance, and MAJOR LEAGUE then boasts all the ingredients to be a pretty darn generous picture - if you're looking for laughs and love and baseball.<br /><br />So the plot, in brief, centers around the hapless Cleveland Indians, who haven't won the pennant in over 30 years. This season, the team is intentionally jampacked with a ragtag bunch of losers and headcases and newbies. The film tracks an unlikely season in Cleveland's history, as somehow the Indians climb out of the cellar and ultimately vie for the pennant. This, despite the duplicity of the newly widowed, ex-showgirl team owner, who schemes to relocate her team to Miami. She's not a nice lady.<br /><br />Absolutely, it's a predictable story, and the feel-good ending not much of a shock. But, man, just the sheer entertainment value oozing from this film! Factor in the excellent script, and take into account the really terrific cast. Starting with Tom Berenger, who keeps everything grounded with his broken-down character, who longs for one more day in the sun and who manages to keep his unruly crew together. Trickle down to Charlie Sheen's deadpanned juvenile delinquent pitcher (I think this was his first major comedic role), James Gammon's maverick, raspy-voiced manager, and Margaret Whitton's devilishly wicked (and sexy) Cleveland Indians owner. Rene Russo makes her debut here, after being a highly sought after supermodel. And, while she doesn't have too many scenes, she proves to be very memorable. Wesley Snipes (startlingly hilarious) and Dennis Haysbert were little known back then, and it's hard to recognize them as, respectively, the speedy showboat Willie Mays Hayes and the bald, voodoo-worshipping Pedro Cerrano. And then there's Bob Uecker, who is simply classic as the boozing Cleveland Indians broadcaster Harry Doyle. And how many of his lines can you quote? Does \\"JUST a bit outside!\\" ring a bell? Enough ESPN anchorfolks have used it...<br /><br />MAJOR LEAGUE, coming out in 1989, does a great job of capturing the essence of life in the big leagues and depicting behind-the-scenes stuff in the clubhouse, and that rough-and-tumble camaredie which bonds a team together. No, it's not as perceptive or wise as, say, BULL DURHAM, but it has its moments. Not much in the way of soul-searching here, no. Instead, MAJOR LEAGUE has a simpler mission, which is to make you snort with laughter (although BULL DURHAM also does this effectively). The soundtrack rocks, by the way. Randy Newman's \\"Burn On\\" nicely opens the movie and is an ode to a long-suffering city of Cleveland. Then there's that one great slow song (don't know the name or singer) which seranades Jake and Lynn up to her loft apartment. And X's \\"Wild Thing\\" provides the chills up your spine as Rick Vaughn at last comes to the mound for his big showdown with Yankees power hitter Clue Haywood. In fact, MAJOR LEAGUE has been instrumental in introducing the trend of closers entering the field to some dramatic music.<br /><br />So this dvd is the Wild Thing Edition and contains a pretty nifty set of bonus features, most of which are worth checking out: an informative audio commentary by the producer and the writer/director; \\"My Kinda Team\\" - the 23-minute-long Making Of segment (where, sadly, you can see how much Berenger has let himself go); A Major League Look At MAJOR LEAGUE - members of the real Cleveland Indians team talk about the film; Bob Uecker: Just A Bit Outside - a spotlight on Bob Uecker; an alternate ending with an introduction by the film producer - this scene purports that the owner Rachel Phelps actually had the team's best interests at heart; A Tour of Cerrano's Locker (dull); and a long-winded photo gallery.<br /><br />Let's see, off the top of my head: the Wild Thing's birth control glasses; Jobu the voodoo god (created for this movie); duct-taping the plane; \\"Hats for bats.\\"; \\"How's your wife and my kids\\"; and, of course, \\"JUST a bit outside!\\" Just some of the stuff which cracked me up so much (and still do). And that's not even mentioning the riveting final game. Anyway, MAJOR LEAGUE proved to be popular enough to spawn two sequels, [[ASIN:B00004RF87 Major League 2]] and [[ASIN:B00004RF84 Major League 3: Back to the Minors]]. The first sequel is pretty good, the other one is a tosser.<br /><br />Underdog films just don't get old. And if it's a sports underdog story, then all the better. MAJOR LEAGUE is raucous and off-the-wall and goofy and funny as hell. Ultimately, it's a feel-good movie that hits all the right notes. The characters are earthy and winning, for a bunch of sad sacks. Since this movie came out, the Cleveland Indians have fared much better in real life, even getting to the World Series in 1995 and 1997. Not bad for reality.<br /><br />But give me the movie every time.te-long Making Of segment (where, sadly, you can see how much Berenger has let himself go); A Major League Look At MAJOR LEAGUE - members of the real Cleveland Indians team talk about the film; Bob Uecker: Just A Bit Outside - a spotlight on Bob Uecker; an alternate ending with an introduction by the film producer - this scene purports that the owner Rachel Phelps actually had the team's best interests at heart; A Tour of Cerrano's Locker (dull); and a long-winded photo gallery.<br /><br />Let's see, off the top of my head: the Wild Thing's birth control glasses; Jobu the voodoo god (created for this movie); duct-taping the plane; \\"Hats for bats.\\"; \\"How's your wife and my kids\\"; and, of course, \\"JUST a bit outside!\\" Just some of the stuff which cracked me up so much (and still do).

B000002C1W|5.0|I would agree with other reviewers, a listener has to take the time frame that Pink Floyd's music was written into account. A person cant look at this album in the context of the 70's Pink Floyd and compare it as bad or worse. Pink Floyd's music has grown and matured at any person does in their own life (at least some people). Yes, this album is sans Roger Waters. It was time to move beyond the war and angst and childhood scars. The Wall was enough, The Final Cut was too much, get on with life. Thats what this album was. David Gilmore is a deeper more pensive lyricist. Both the music and lyrics of this album attest. Its like good poetry, you have to keep looking for the hidden deeper meaning. If you dont get a poem the first time you read it, it doesnt mean the poem is crap. With this album Pink Floyd keeps that dark melancholic and enigmatic thread that can be found in most of their albums. If you are looking for the sound of Dark Side or The Wall, that was then. This album is now.
0307265730|5.0|Lahiri continues to delight with her latest offering.  This was as excellent as her other stories.  Her writing is careful and sparse, complimenting the subtlety of her subject matter. Her displaced ethnic subject, underpinning most of her work, adds a sense of the exotic. We don't really understand, nor can we possibly understand, because eastern blood doesn't run in our veins.  The people of color in her stories are \\"in\\" our world, but not \\"of\\" our world. They don't really understand it all, so how can we?  I love her work.  My only wish is for her to write faster, so there is more of it to read.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|I must say I really liked this movie, it is long but a very absorbing film not to violent, it may have been based on a true story but there is some stretching in the tale to be sure but it still makes a very good movie, both leads are excellent in their roles, In my book a must see movie

B00005J6SZ|5.0|An artist's biggest fear:  The sophomore slump.    The industry's nickname of when a new artist fails to match or best the success of their first release.  As we all know, this was not an issue with Madonna.  And on November 12, 1984, we all witnessed the now \\"Material Girls\\" meteoric rise to superstardom.      What was apparent was what was on the horizon.  Controversy.      Titling an album with the word \\"Virgin\\" was pretty gutsy in 1984.  And what happened on the very first MTV video music awards had some in shock.  But, like it or not, Madonna had found America's \\"button\\" and she pushed it with glee.    Labeled \\"An annoying one-hit-wonder, with the voice of Minnie Mouse on helium\\", Madonna's second album found her branching out to new musical genres.  Pop, R&B, and a first for Madonna, ballads.     Selling almost 20 Million copies worldwide, this is Madonna's second album, and a fine example of what was happening musically in 1984.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Absolutely amazing. The box set and quality is viewtiful. The number of extras and special features is drool-worthy. The movies in their original and uncut glory is fantastic.    Well worth the money.
B00005J6T1|5.0|Before a single publicity shot was released, Madonna had already begun her now endless run on the charts.  Some thought Madonna was African American, some thought it was a new lead singer for the group \\"The Dazz Band\\"  then, on July 27, 1983 the secret was out.  Madonna was here.... to stay.    Chock full of happy-go-lucky songs, \\"Madonna\\" was what pop music was all about in 1983.  R&B infused dance music with insanely catchy lyrics and videos that captured the carefree artist who was about to begin a musical journey through 3 decades.      Not only was her music changing the world, Madonna's look also took America by storm.  You couldn't throw a stick without hitting a teenaged girl with dozens of black \\"gummi\\" bracelets on her wrist, or a lace bow tied in her processed to the hilt blond hair.  This was a cultural phenomenon and Corporate America was watching.  MACY'S opened a boutique in several of it's stores with fashions and accessories based on Madonna's look.     This is where it all started and for the next year and a half, you couldn't turn on the radio or watch the then brand new MTV without Ms. Ciccone's infectious pop creations assaulting your senses.      \\"Everybody\\", \\"Lucky Star\\", \\"Borderline\\", \\"Physical Attraction\\", \\"Holiday\\", \\"Burning Up\\"  ... Need I say more?    Perfection.
0812974611|4.0|I read this one in one night and enjoyed it greatly. There's an action packed plot--politics, greed, and a lovely romance all move it right along plus there is lots of accurate historical detail regarding the eruption of Vesuvius. The author puts you right in the thick of it in the days leading up to the eruption. The reader knows what is coming but the characters in the novel don't....very exciting--fast paced and an absorbing read.
B000002LGQ|4.0|For those of us who ran to the record store on March 21, 1989 to grab Madonna's fourth (and widely considered 2nd best album ever - behind Ray of Light) were pleasantly surprised....  sort of.  It seems Madonna had the initial pressing of albums and cassettes scented with her favorite scent - Patchouli - which my cassette STILL smells of 19 years later!    As for the music, \\"Like A Virgin\\" showed a lot more growth musically for Madonna.  Instead of 10 dance infused numbers, this set included some heavy material in song.  She addressed her mother's death on \\"Promise To Try\\" and the end of her marriage to Sean Penn on \\"Til Death Do Us Part\\".  Otherwise, Madonna kept the party light with her signature carefree, bouncy, pop creations we all loved.    Along with the title track, \\"Express Yourself\\" helped nickname Madonna the \\"Stainless Steel Sex Symbol\\" for her ability to dodge controversy no matter the subject matter.  \\"Cherish\\" and \\"Keep It Together\\" also continued the dance party theme.    Aside from the controversies that accompanied the album (Pepsi, Like A Virgin Video) this is Madonna at her best and 12 million plus copies sold can attest to the power the Material Girl was gaining on her continued feat to \\"Rule The World\\" as she had famously advise Dick Clark on American Bandstand 5 years earlier.    She may not have ruled the world (yet) but she was certainly ruling the charts.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Be prepared to watch perhaps the funniest comedy ever made. Husband and wife team of John Cleese and Connie Booth do an excellent job of writing and acting along with a great cast. The supporting actors are very good but my personal favorite is Manuel, the butler, played by Andrew Sachs. My wife and I placed everything aside in order to watch the series when it originally aired on PBS in the 1970's. Now we can watch it at our leisure. The DVD's are top quality and play well. It is well worth the money.  This set is the complete series, along with some special features, but I sure wish they had made more episodes. I could enjoy it forever.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|The year: 1992.  The premise: \\"Shock and Awe\\"  The result: Madonna's second best album to date (behind Ray Of Light).  Sure, the accompanying coffee table book \\"Sex\\" was the headline grabbing news item of the day, but what few realized was that the CD that was released with it was nothing short of musical nirvana.  Yes, I said nirvana.  That's a strong statement, but have you listened to Erotica?  I mean, LISTENED to it?  It's pure genius.     The theme throughout the album is that Madonna is \\"Dita\\" the dominatrix.  And that's exactly what happens during the 80 minutes that follow.  Madonna is in charge.  She will tell you what to feel, how to feel it, and just when you think you can't take anymore, you can.  Not a simple feat on a CD.      Dark, moody, and sexy are the colors she paints with on this album.  This is Madonna's show and you are only there because she said so.  You never forget who is in charge, and honestly, you like it that way.   Sure, there are \\"softer\\" moments on the CD  (\\"Rain\\", \\"Secret Garden\\", \\"Bad Girl\\") but those are the softer moments SHE allows you to witness... but only for a moment.    She also gives you a few minutes to dance  (\\"Deeper and Deeper\\" \\"Bye Bye Baby\\", \\"Fever\\")  but even then, She is calling the shots and you are left to her wishes.       This entire CD is both amazing inside and out.  Some little known facts about this amazing CD:    \\"In This Life\\" is based on George Gershwin's Prelude No. 2.  \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" videos were shot in near identical style to many Andy Warhol films.  \\"Erotica\\" is Madonna's first album to bear a \\"Parental Advisory\\" label.  \\"Bad Girl\\" was planned as the second single from the album with an X-rated video to match.   Originally, the album was to feature completely different artwork. Warner Bros. Records refused to use it, as it was too explicit.    Perhaps not a CD you would throw in while delivering the kids to soccer practice, but undeniably one of Madonna's finest concoctions.
B000Y35A94|5.0|When the hell are we allowed to pre-order this, or is this just another case of Amazon putting a release date they pulled out of a hat on a product?
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I am so impressed by this album. I was worried when I heard 4 minutes because it felt too hip hop. I know that song is doing well but the rest of the album is pure perfection. Spanish Lessons is the only dud but I'll eventually like it with a few more listens. Sadly, I couldn't say the same about 4 minutes.     This is the album that should have succeeded American Life, even though COAD was great, it made me dance more on the inside than the outside. I can't stop dancing and I can't stop listening to this album. Buy it now.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|One single listening of this album is enough to fall in love with this new release from the pop diva Madonna.  \\"Hard Candy\\" is a collection of twelve tracks consistent to all previous Madonna works since \\"Ray of Light\\", when she started adopting more of a pop-electronic-dance style hardly filled with slow ballads. Basically, there are no or very few connections to what she had done until \\"Bedtime Stories\\", the last album that followed a style she has begun with since her very first album in the 80s.<br /><br />This album is very well produced, arrangements are well done and songs are captivating, to say the least. Those who normally follow Timbaland will certainly recognize his presence by the sound effects and producing style found on most of the tracks.<br /><br />All songs from this album have a good beat, are enthusiastically played and very energizing from the rhythm standpoint. Lyrically speaking, \\"Miles Away\\" (probably about dealing with her relationship with Guy Ritchie when they are apart due to professional reasons), \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and \\"Voices\\" are the most beautiful ones. \\"Give It 2 Me\\", \\"She's Not Me\\" (which talks about being replaced for someone else) and \\"Incredible\\" have a very provocative storyline on each. \\"Dance 2night\\" is also a beautiful song, both lyrically and musically.<br /><br />So far, this is the best 2008 release in pop music.
9562913686|5.0|Even though this book was published in the 1960's, it is still as powerful and relevant as it was 40 years ago.     It has definately changed my life for the better. I look at thousands of books a year in my business and this book is on my top 5 list. I was so impressed with this book that I bought more copies for my grown children and i keep my copy on my bed stand so I may refer to it frequently.    The author has many other books which are also top rate. These books will change your life for the better.
0743298039|4.0|Vita Winter is the most famous English author of her time, but despite of the dozens of stories she has published, she has never told the single true story of her own life. Now, old and dying, she commissions amateur biographer Margaret Lea to record her story, and begins to tell of her past: the story of a gothic mansion, a pair of feral twins, a ghost, and a fire. Winter's tale is couched within Margret's own, and both stories are deep with secrets, unfolding like a traditional gothic novel. However, Setterfield's writing does not quite rise to meet her premise, and her ghost story is readable and intriguing but never quite engrossing--in the end, it falls a bit flat. Characterization is too simple, the trope of twins is stretched too thin, and Setterfield cannot convincingly write about \\"the best writer in the English language\\" when her own skills as a writer fall so far short of that ideal. The reading is enjoyable and the concept is quite clever, but on the whole the book is only somewhere just above average: capable, interesting, but never amazing. I recommend it only moderately.<br /><br />For me, this novel's potential and weakness is typified (and without spoilers!) by Vita Winter: Setterfield intends her to be the best, the most famous English author of her time, but in Winter's storytelling and book excerpts she is a mimicry of true talent, passable or else exaggerated but never truly great. The Thirteenth Tale has an intriguing premise: the secret past of a brilliant author, the secret past of our recalcitrant narrator, a crumbling gothic mansion, crazed women, wild twins, a ghost, a governess, a garden, a secret language, endless libraries... There is certainly enough there to make a dark and mysterious gothic novel to rival Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, or Rebecca, and that seems to be the author's intent. This concept and the plot are also enough to keep the reader attentive and interested through the length of the book, full of pleasant twists and turns, hints and secrets.<br /><br />But for all of this potential, the novel does not quite rise to meet it. The Thirteenth Tale is nothing like Jane Eyre. There are little details, such as repetition in the storytelling or abrupt and unnecessary changes in tense, and there are bigger problems: Setterfield stretches her concepts too thin, in particular the bond between twins, until these once interesting ideas begin to feel overweighted and exaggerated. Margaret's narration also lacks a certain spark since the reader has problems identifying with her back story and her internal commentary tends towards childish or melodramatic. Setterfield's storytelling lacks real mystery and tension and at the end, after all of the secrets have been revealed, they seem in retrospect to be a little contrived and not quite worth the effort it took to get to them.<br /><br />Make no mistake: The Thirteenth Tale is by no means bad. The premise is wonderful, the plot twists pleasantly and contains ever more secrets to reveal, and the storytelling, although not great, is good enough. The book kept me interested and involved, and so I feel comfortable recommending it. However, I only recommend it moderately, because the novel is little more than a polite homage to the sort of gothic novel that it aims to be. I appreciate the literary references and the author's, and charaters's, love of books, but in the end I would much rather go to and recommend the source. This book is a love story to books such as Jane Eyre, but Jane Eyre (and soforth) is the thing itself, with the same haunted atmosphere and secretive plot, but with skillful storytelling as well.

B0010DRYRI|5.0|`Amadeus' was one of the most refreshing spectacles I have had the pleasure of witnessing in quite some time.  I was personally blown away with what I was presented with and have thus concluded `Amadeus' to be one of the best motion pictures in the history of motion pictures.  If you have not had the privilege of witnessing this powerful film then please, stop everything you are doing and track this movie down, order it straight from this webpage if you need to, but please watch this movie immediately.  I don't think I've been this passionate about a single film since I saw `The Godfather' for the first time.  Truly all the praise and admiration that has been associated with this masterclass of a film is well warranted.  `Amadeus' is astounding from start to finish, a truly mesmerizing and utterly flawless production.  Milos Forman is God; seriously.<br /><br />As the film opens we meet Antonio Salieri, a man gone crazy.  He is living in an asylum and claims to have murdered Mozart.  In the opening scenes of the film Salieri is met by a priest who wants to hear his story and so Salieri proceeds to tell him how it was that he came to meet, grow to despise and eventually kill Mozart.<br /><br />Antonio Salieri was an aspiring composer who has reached a certain level of fame as court composer to Emperor Joseph II but he has achieved nothing in comparison to the fame and recognition as the esteemed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  Salieri himself feels that Mozart's music is divine, something sent from God above (kind of the way I feel about this movie) but when he has the chance to finally meet this messenger of God he is let down.  Mozart is not the noble gentlemen he had expected but instead is a pompous arrogant vile thing that sends shivers down Salieri's spine.<br /><br />How could God use this disgusting man in such a beautiful and miraculous way?<br /><br />It becomes apparent that the Emperor is smitten with Mozart's talent though and this bothers Salieri, not to mention others close to the Emperor.  Salieri then decides that he is to make it his life goal to destroy Mozart, to strip him of his power and social standing and ruin him, yes, kill him.  He concocts a plan all his own to accomplish this and sets it all in motion, waiting for the time to be right to strike and make his dreams come true.<br /><br />`Amadeus', as I mentioned earlier, is perfect.  I seriously cannot find a single flaw.  The script is deliciously absorbing and never loses the interest of its audience.  The direction is nothing short of phenomenal and the acting across the board is superb.  The two leads are brilliant.  F. Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar for his performance, captures the very dire frustration and conflicting emotions that drives Salieri to madness and Tom Hulce (who should have won the Oscar in my humble opinion) dominates as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, completely fleshing out his talent as well as the demons that choked out the flame that was his life.  Elizabeth Berridge was sorely robbed of an Oscar nomination.  Her portrayal of Mozart's doting wife Constanze is brilliantly crafted and expertly executed.<br /><br />The only word I can use to describe this film is ecstasy; pure, unbridled ecstasy.  Since seeing this film I've thought of nothing else and have a feeling that I will think of nothing else for quite a while still to come.  Please, I beg of you, experience this film for yourself.  You will not regret it.<br /><br />Consider me entertained.r.

B000B5XOY8|4.0|It feels unfair to compare Burton's 1989 film with `Batman Begins'; Christopher Nolan's vastly superior introduction to the Dark Knight.  So, I will try with all earnestness not to do that.  Burton's original is dark, brooding, moody and effective to a point, but it falls short of the brilliance that was captured by Nolan's recent attempt to revive the superhero genre.<br /><br />I will say this; this is a superhero movie that for the most part feels like a `superhero' movie.  Remember the days before the nipple-suits and the emo haircuts?  `Batman' is one of the first films to take the `superhero' genre to a serious level, ditching the camp that comes along with most of this franchise and creating a dark and mysterious atmosphere, richly rewarding.  It's a shame that the Batman films began to wane and drift backwards into camp and gag-jokes instead of sticking with Burton's original vision.  Thankfully Christopher Nolan revived it, in a huge way, with `batman Begins' and it looks like `The Dark Knight' will be just as rewarding.<br /><br />`Batman' follows the Dark Knight as he tracks down the insane Joker who is attempting to take over Gotham City with toxic gas.  The Joker was horrendously disfigured thanks to betrayal from amongst his fellow crooks and wants to exact revenge.  Batman also must juggle his personal life (that as Bruce Wayne) when the beautiful photographer Vicki Vale starts making eyes at him.<br /><br />For the most part there is little to complain about here.  The movie is exciting and entertaining and takes the genre to a place it had yet to be taken.  The discrepancies within the plot are forgivable (this is a `superhero' movie) and the lack of real character development is understandable.  `Batman Begins' for a lot of people was too long and too slow because Nolan decided to forsake an action filled film and focus on really creating the man that shaped the legend.  I personally felt that that move was genius, but it's understandable why Burton would want to focus on special effects and action scenes in order to draw in a crowd as apposed to slowing down the pace and alienating the action junkies.  The real drawback for me though was the acting.  I found Michael Keaton's Batman to be decent, but I found his Bruce Wayne to be stale.  Christian Bale brought Bruce Wayne to a whole new level that Keaton couldn't even comprehend.  Yes, Wayne is a mystery, but the audience is supposed to desire to understand that mystery.  Keaton bored me.  Kim Basinger was you token hot chick here.  There is really no development on her part.  She's pretty and infatuated and she screams a lot (which can get kind of annoying).<br /><br />And then we have Jack Nicholson.  I'm bracing myself for a lot of `unhelpful' votes here.  Let me say this first; I absolutely LOVE Jack Nicholson.  He is one of my all time favorite actors in the world, and I totally understand that he plays a variation of himself in most every performance he gives, and I like that about him.  Here though, I found myself annoyed.  He hams up the Joker so much that he just becomes goofy.  There are moments of brilliant `insanity' but for the most part he overdoes it to such an extreme that he loses any real maniacal nature.  He just comes off like an idiot.  I hate saying that because this performance is lauded by a lot of people as the performance that makes this movie so great, but honestly I don't see it.<br /><br />In the end, I like `Batman', I just don't love it.  I would watch it again and it is far grander than anything that Schumacher did with that dreadful `Batman & Robin'.  Burton captured the grim feeling that surrounded the comics baring this name and infused his own visual style, which worked wonders for the film.  As a `superhero' action film `Batman' is top notch.  As a character study and dramatic marvel it loses ground.  It all really depends on what you want to see.  I personally prefer `Batman Begins' but I know a lot of people who prefer Burton's classic.<br /><br />Either way, you can't really go wrong.u can't really go wrong.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The version that played in the cinemas is nothing compared to the version on the video entitled \\"George's Band\\". This is hands down the best concert ever. Who would have thought of all the Beatles that the quiet one, George, could have spawned such a show? With the passing of the years and in the shadows of Lennon/McCartney, It has been easy to forget how many great songs George composed. That is until these great songs are performed with such respect and in such reverence by the likes of Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Ringo Star, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Billy Preston and many others of George's dearest friends. You won't believe what happens when egos are checked at the door and musicians of such caliber get together  at the Royal Albert Hall to perform George's music with his son. It is truly remarkable. If you haven't seen \\"George's Band\\" on the DVD Concert for George you have missed the best show ever. It might bring a tear to your eye.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|WOW!!!  What an incredible collection of new amazing songs from the queen of pop!!!  If you liked Madonna's old classics, you will surley have a nice taste for this ear candy.  She goes back to her roots with a new updated twist that is not only jamming, but alot of fun in the process. The new beats are just what the doctor ordered for our Lady \\"M\\".  These songs are sure to bring Madonna back on top. Incredible confection, INDEED!!
B000001DYY|5.0|I was at a Home Depot a couple weeks ago and heard the song \\"Woman in chains\\" and it made me remember how much I miss listening to the album sowing the seeds of love. I had lost it many years ago. I ordered it here as soon as I got home that day. I also ordered this album \\"Elemental\\" and am stunned how much it has grown on me. In fact I liked it so much I ordered \\"Tomcats screaming outside\\" along with all the out of print ones used as well. All of the albums Tears for fears have done fall so harmoniously with my personality. My personal favorite on Elemental is the last song, \\"goodnight song\\". It has such a powerful vibe to it, its like Roland is summing up his experience on stage. Having been a performing songwriter myself, his style and message has always influenced me as a musician.
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|I was disappointed with *Bee Movie*.  Sure, it had some funny lines and adult humor, but the story plot was bad.  I mean, it's bad enough that you won't catch me watching it again.  From the mid-point to the end, it was just dry and I could not wait til the movie was over.<br /><br />Barry Benson has just graduated from college.  However, he's appalled to learn that he only gets one chance to select a career, which he's stuck with until death.  Barry wants a chance to fly outside the hive before deciding his professional fate.<br /><br />The bees have a couple of rules that they must not break.  One of them is talking to humans.  Barry ends up talking to a human florist, after she saved his life from being swatted from her fiance.<br /><br />Barry soon learns that humans have been eating and selling their honey, which the bees have worked hard for.  Barry, with the florist's help, decides to sue humanity for profiting from \\"bee-manity\\"'s labor, which he eventually wins.<br /><br />However, he soon learns that his victory has a negative global impact.  If he doesn't act soon, then life on earth will no longer be the same.<br /><br />Eh!  It's like I said, funny one-liners and that's about all that the movie is good for.  The story plot is definitely not a classic.  I definitely will not watch it again.
0142405787|5.0|Scorpia  By: Anthony Horowitz    For 14-year-old spy Alex Rider, everything changes when he finds out about his father's involvement in Scorpia, a highly wanted criminal organization. Caught up between M16 and Scorpia, he doesn't know which side he should take. To make matters even worse he learns from Scorpia about some of the horrible things his father has done. Not knowing if Scorpia is telling the truth, Alex joins Scorpia. This time when trouble strikes, he will be alone, without M16 and their fancy gadgets.  With so many exciting turning points and cliffhangers this was my favorite book in The Alex Rider Adventures. Scorpia is filled with action, fighting and adventure. I couldn't put this book down because there were stunning moments everywhere in the book.   Although it takes a few chapters until this book gets really exciting and to the point, it's well worth the wait. This is one of those books you could just read all day. I recommend this book to any teen that likes fighting, action, and adventure.   If you like the Cherub series, you'll like Scorpia. This book will have you wanting to read all the other Alex Rider books.     By: David S.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I picked up my copy of HARD CANDY this morning and I have to say it is pretty good. There has been so much talk in regards to Madonna crossing over into \\"HIP-HOP\\".    Don't be fooled!     Madonna has always been in total control of which musical direction she chooses to take. Once again, HARD CANDY will be spinning in all of the dance clubs around the world. Her first single 4 minutes with J.T. is just a sample of what LADY M has to offer. This isn't Confessions, but as others have said, it is just as good.     CANDY SHOP has that urban sound but a great starter for this FRESH AND FUNKY trip through the CANDY SHOP.    GIVE IT 2 ME is just INCREDIBLE, I sure hope she plans on making this a single and remix!    HEARTBEAT is another great track that just keeps getting better each time I listen to it.    BEAT GOES ON with KANYE WEST is just fantastic as well. Hopefully another single and a remix!    MILES AWAY is MADONNA at her best and SHE'S NOT ME will grow on you.    I have been waiting for the follow up to C.O.A.D.F. and I gotta tell you, MADONNA hit home with another FRESH DANCE ALBUM!!    BUY IT AND TURN IT UP!!
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I always thought that \\"Confessions\\" would be a hard album to top and it seems as though I was quite right! Hard Candy really did leave a very disgustingly BITTER taste in my mouth! Jeff Miers of The Buffalo News sums up the album quite well:    \\"One could reasonably bestow kudos upon Madonna for surviving as long as she has in a business that thrives on rapid turnover. However, one could just as easily chastise her inability to display any real growth after 25 years as a music-maker. If \\"Hard Candy\\" is the best she can do, then Madonna really is no better than Stefani and Spears, tenacity and survival instincts notwithstanding. We should expect more from her.\\"      Has the Queen of Reinvention now switched gears to be proclaimed the \\"Queen of Conformity?\\" Sure as hell looks that way, mores the pity really.    I think this album is one for the Microwave
0345495004|3.0|A recent Amazon reviewer wished that Nancy Horan would continue her saga about Frank Lloyd Wright's relationships with women to include his third and final wife, Olgivanna.  As a previous reviewer noted some time back, that book has already been published, The Fellowship: The Untold Story of Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Fellowship by Roger Friedland and Harold Zellman.  As compelling a character as the Mamah Cheney of Loving Frank is, she pales in comparison to Olgivanna, the strange occultist that Wright met ten years after Cheney's death.  Their marriage, the centerpiece of The Fellowship, lasted twenty five years until Wright's death, a period that combined extraordinary architectural achievements by Wright with a bizarre social world managed by Olgivanna.  The USA Today quote printed on the back of the book is really true: \\"You can't top the material for richness: genius, sex, spirituality, money, mania\\".  And though it is as engaging a story as Loving Frank, it is entirely non-fiction.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I'm not sure this is really a 5 star record. But seeing that it's probably the best of her lot, I'll be generous. I didn't much care for the opener 'Slave 4 U.' But 'OverProtected' has a catchy edge. 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman' has a pleasant sound to it. I don't like 'Boys.' 'Anticipating' has a nice pleasant sound. the cover of 'I Love Rock and Roll' has a good sound. 'Cinderella' has a GREAT rocky edge. 'Let Me Be' is a nice gentle song. 'Bombastic Love' is different, but still good. 'That's Where You Take Me' is listenable. 'What It's Like To Be Me' has a notable energy, and ends the record on a high note.<br /><br />Of all Britney's records, I feel this has the strongest energy as well as the best consistency.
B000EMGAOY|1.0|In the time it's taken for the Chili Peppers to release thier last two albums they've turned from one of the best bands of the past 20 years to a mass produced teen pop band! Anthony Kiedis sounds like he should be singing in an emo band and Flea's bass lines have about as much balls as the last James Taylor album (don't get me wrong, I love James Taylor). Also, a double album? There arn't enough quality songs on this record to make a single album! Now, for those people that say artist's music changes over time, you're right and a lot of the time it's a welcome change, but their music should evolve and become even greater than it was, not something that sounds like it's made for teenie boppers.<br />Flea was quoted saying \\"If you don't like this album, you don't like the Chili Peppers.\\" Well I loved the Chili Peppers and \\"Heyyooo this is what I sayyooo, THIS ALBUM SUCKS MY KISS!!!!\\" Stick with the first 7 albums!
B0000087QO|5.0|If you follow my reviews, you know that King Diamond is one of my all time favorites. I also really like EXODUS and Bon Jovi. I have respect for Britney Spears. I also like some Europe.<br /><br />I am not the biggest Blondie fan, but I don't deny her \\"Parallel Lines\\" record is a real masterpiece. (A finepiece of 70s History!) 'Hanging on the Telephone' is a great intro. 'One Way or Another' is a powerful song with a rocky edge. 'Picture This' and 'Fade Away' are nice. 'Pretty Baby' is alright. 'I Don't Know' is ok. '11:59' keeps the tone of the record and helps maintain its edge. 'Will Anything Happen' also keeps energy levels up. 'Sunday Girl' has a nice pleasant sound to it. 'Heart of Glass' is not my favorite, but I understand it was a major hit. 'I'm Gonna Love You Too' has a nice energy as well as a great sound. 'Just Go Away' is a powerful song that ends the record on a high note.<br /><br />While I will probably always lean towards heavy metal records like Bon Jovi's \\"7800,\\" the reality is that other things are nice too. And Blondie's \\"Parallel Lines\\" is a GREAT record thst is pleasant with just the right amount of a rocky edge. It is a real masterpiece, and a fine piece of the 70s.
0307383415|5.0|It seemed to be in my best interest to find out something more than that Oprah seemed to think Senator Obama was a man of great importance. I found this book fascinating; a sensitive account of his tremendous drive to help people rather than sit behind a high paying desk job and living the life as such. Obama and Hillary seemed driven to help our country as youngsters. Open your mind and heart to Obama and read this book as well as others about our candidates.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Very quickly, I did enjoy parts of \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops I Did It Again.\\" I think \\"Britney\\" was her best. I did enjoy her \\"Greates Hits\\" record. Looking ahead, \\"Blackout\\" had some decent moments.<br /><br />After her really great 3rd record, I was hoping this 4th one would be better. (Well, at least I didn't think it was.) However, that is NOT to say it didn't have some really great moments. 'Showdown' certainly has a catchy sound. 'Breathe On Me' is different, but interesting. 'Toxic' takes an aspect of the human condition and reveals it for what it can be. 'Outrageous' has a nice energy to it. 'Shadow' is a great song and a strong contender for the best one on the record.<br /><br />So while my favorite remains her excellent 3rd record, this 4th one certainly has its great moments.
0385338694|5.0|This was the first book I read from Sophie Kinsella and perhaps that's the reason it's still my favorite one. This book offers everything a chick lit novel is expected to serve: light humor, a little mystery, romance and lovely images of the english countryside, where small villages with nice pubs, small rivers, stone bridges, wonderful gardens full of flowers and aromas exists. I've never actually been in the english countryside, but the images created by this novel were so vivid I felt I was there. As a result, it was one of the most relaxing and escapist novels I've read. The storyline was engaging, the writing style flawless and the mixture of humor, romance and suspense absolutely perfect. I've read it twice since, when I'm feeling down and don't want to take risks with other books, because it's guaranteed to make me feel good, as opposed to other chick lit books that try to do so but fail miserable (Just friends and Perfect Timing come to mind).
B0006FO8RA|4.0|Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I did enjoy \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops I Did It Again.\\" My favorite is \\"Britney.\\" \\"In the Zone\\" had its moments.<br /><br />Ms. Spears does a fairly good job of putting her greatest songs together as well as giving us some previously unreleased tracks. (This is not always the custom of 'Greatest Hits' records.)<br /><br />The new 'my Prerogative' is a GREAT opener with a rocky edge.  'Toxic' keeps the energy of the record up. I don't much like 'Slave 4 U,\\" but the record recovers with 'Oops I Did It Again.' 'Me Against the Music' has its charm. 'Stronger' and 'Everytime' are especially good. 'Baby One More Time' is catchy. 'Crazy' is redone and has an almost hard 80s sound to it. I did not like 'Boys.' But 'Sometimes' is nice and pleasant. 'Overprotected' has a nice rocky edge to it. 'Lucky' is not my favorite, but it is alright. 'Outrageous' has a different, but still great energy. 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman' has a beautiful sound to it. Britney gives us some other interesting sounding unreleased tracks at the end.<br /><br />While she included some songs from her previous records I didn't much like, I still think it is a GREAT collection. I also think it is cool that she made her cool song 'Crazy' even better. It was also nice that she gave us the great new song 'My Prerogative.'<br /><br />Thanks for the great record Ms. Spears!
B0015I2P0Y|3.0|I placed this CD in the player with much anticipation as I had waited a long time for this little jewel to arrive. I was so ready for it to caress my ears with the inteligent, whiskey-soaked lyrics coordinated with the extremely well placed notes from all of the other musicians who blend so well and with much grace.    Ahhhh, such a smooth start and just the right sound. This is just what the doctor ord......WHAT THE..... OUCH!!!! WHAT IS THAT NOISE?  It sounds like a locomotive air horn that has just been set off in the passenger seat.  Whew.... That was painful and definitley not what I expected from such a soft start.  Ok, it has went back to the soft trott that we started with...ok, maybe I can get back into this now that my heart has been placed back in my chest.....  OUCH!!!!! THERE IT GOES AGAIN..... Is this some kind of joke?  IS ELBOW JUST &%$@&$@ WITH ITS LISTENERS?  This definitely isn't what I expected.  I think this was a set up to blow out the speakers, or worse, my eardrums.  In fact, the liner notes even tell me to turn the volume way up as it as been recorded at a low level. As if it needed to be any louder. Seriously, was this done on purpose?  Was it a set up?     The whole album is just too chaotic and without sequence.  Call me spoiled but the previous recordings are much, MUCH better and are balanced with intelligence and emotion. THATS MISSING FROM THIS RECORDING.      I know I am going to get an earfull from other reviewers who do not agree.  Maybe I am being too harsh.  If only Elbow could have done away with the steroid laden bagpipes or hid them somewhere towards the back of the CD. It just set the mood and the mood was bad.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|Lame attempt at recapturing her early recordings - now for the iPod generation. When you compare this with \\"Bedtime Stories\\" - well, time to hang up the spurs and saddle girl - hard to bite down on the bridle of \\"age\\" - well, here it comes.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|As a fan of Madonna's since Like A Prayer (I was twelve at the time), I have loved most of her CD's (I'm Breathless, Erotica,and GHV2 being the exceptions), and Hard Candy is one of them. The CD sounds like Madonna's earlier CD's, which I like. You should definetly check it out.    Tracks on CD:    1. Candy Shop (8/10): Good opener, but not my favorite on the CD.  2. 4 Minutes (9/10): First single and awesome.  3. Give it 2 Me (9/10): Second single and love the beat of it.  4. Heartbeat (10/10): Love this song and a good contender for single.  5. Miles Away (10/10): Reminds me of songs on American Life, SWEET!!!!  6. She's Not Me (9/10): Reminds me of a Debbie Harry song, early 80's vibe.  7. Incredible (7/10): Good song but not one of my favorites.  8. Beat Goes On (10/10): Favorite song on Hard Candy, should be released as a single. Love Kanye West and Pharrel on track! Awesome!  9. Dance 2Night (9/10): Good song, early 80's vibe with JT  10. Spanish Lesson (6/10): Least favorite song, OK.  11. Devil Would...(8/10): Sounds like Cry Me a River and What Goes Around Comes Around off of JT's CD's  12. Voices (9/10): Good closer to CD
0307394549|5.0|I really liked this book.  I do agree with others, that the recipes are online, but its nice not to have to print them and have them all together.  I made the cookies on the cover and got rave reviews.  I love the pictures and the recipes are really well written.  A great book for a baker!
B00139W3NE|5.0|Very good - so much more depth than the Narnia movie.  Great acting, beautiful scenes & thought provoking subjects.  I can't wait for the next movie in the Dark Trilogy series.  Finally a movie for thinking people!
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|Everyone keeps praising this album for having a fresh sound.  Yes \\"Third\\"  does sound different then past albums, and everyone praises them for that.    However personally I want more of the old style.  That is the Portishead I can bob my head to.  Their first two albums is what brought me to love and appreciate the band(and you other fans too!), so why is it so wrong for them to make another album like them?? I would love another album of fantastic songs that I can listen to from beginning to end.  I'm not saying the album isn't without merit. However A lot of the album has the feel of Beth/rustin man project, \\"Out of Season\\".  The recipe of their songs on the last two albums worked so well.  If you are expecting the same groove that you loved about their first two albums, you will be let down.  If you really loved \\"Out of Seasons\\" and mixed in some(a small bit) of the portishead feel, then you might be happy.  That being said, I would have welcomed More of the Same from such a wonderfully talented group!           EDIT-  After listening to this album more I have to say I dislike it very much.  I skip it everytime a song from this album comes on.  I should just remove it from my Zune and pretend the album doesn't exist.  I do hope they return to the sound that made them great.
B0001AP12G|1.0|The title must be a metaphor for West himself, because only someone as uneducated and stupid as he is would think as much of this garbage and himself as he does.

B0015D3Z4O|3.0|© Jean(John) Simard, Montreal  april 29, 2008     I'm fan since 1982, I grew up with Madonna's music and I love her as a human being.  So don't answer to me saying that I put her down, I was there before her new 20 years old fan !    Here's my first feeling of Madge new ALBUM :     01 Candy Shop : A sweet invitation to dance under the beat of the moment.  Madonna order the producers to put her voice in the first range.  The subject is so easy... Candy Shop, lollipop... Please M, we want more subtle lines ! NEXT    02 4 Minutes to save the world : A great single, would be better as the first song on the album.  I'm not a big fan of duo but as hip-pop single, it's fine.  I'm already tired of hearing it though...         03 Give in to me  : At the beginning, I thought it was a bad demo from her rock group in 1979.  A lot of echos in the voice, it's club ready.  I don't understand the buzz and why it's the second single...  There is sound from Usher's \\"Yeah Yeah\\" .  This song feels like it was written for \\"Ray of light\\".   It's a running theme for M, \\"I want to dance, I can't stop, I'm crazy, I can dance longer than you... \\"  Well, we heard that feeling on \\"Impressive Instant\\" in 2000.  The bridge with \\"Get stupid\\" is sooooo useless... NEXT      04 Heartbeat : MY MADONNA IS BACK ! The hook is perfect for me, her voice in high notes gives me shivers and here's come the chorus... WOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUU ! I LOVE IT.   Ok, it's a glamourize version of Nelly Fertado.  This would be a better SECOND SINGLE for a summer hit.  The techno sounds are still there, like a Confessions flashback...    05 Miles Away : Guitar, break beat... is this a faster version of « Don't tell me » ?  The chorus arrives to empower the melody. It's beautiful.  Romantic in the lyrics.  I feel Madonna's emotion.  At the end, still echos of Confessions, I have the impression that \\"Jump\\" will follow... Great song.    06 She's not me :  My God, Madonna winks at Duran Duran !   The crescendo is really cool but the CHORUS broke everything.  It's so linear.  Yes, there's a groove and the beat coming from the underground in the middle of the sound is familiar ( Hung up everybody ??? ).  I love the dance part at the end.  Is this a love song or a metaphor for the Madonna's wannabe ?  Let's ask the real M !!!    07 Incredible : What is that ???  It's a faster version of  \\"Someone to call my lover\\" from Janet Jackson in 2001.  This kind of production was heard a thousand times at the beginning of the new music millennium.  All this just to tell us that sex is Incredible.   I imagine that they wanted us to feel the beat of love but this sounds orgy is not sexy to me.  You can find better sexy songs on Erotica.     08 Beat goes on : I like the ouverture.  It's feel-like Holiday-Lucky Star song.  I heard the demo and it was hip hop.  This version is a big surprise. I LOVE IT.  A great groove line... \\"Get down, bip bip...\\" She wants us to dance.  It's really 80's.  The rap is annoying ( Michael Jackson impose that with Dangerous, soooo 1991 ).  She gives this song to her hardcore fans, I'm one of them, I take it.  I'm hooked.     09 Dance Tonight : A bizarre groove in the hook.   A mix of \\"Last night the DJ saved my life\\" with the \\"Play that funky music\\" guitar.   ATTENTION FANS : The chorus is a sampling of \\"I need your loving\\" from Teena Marie\\". Do your research, you will be surprise.  It's not even written in the booklet.  I smell the controversy.  An average production.  Should be accelerate to 130 BPM.    10 Spanish Lesson : A spanish version of Incredible.  BAD BAD BAD.  It wants you to dance but it's a miss.  I don't know what to say...  NEXT     11 Devil wouldn't recognize you  : \\"Bad Girl\\" melts into \\"Cry me a river\\".  I think it's the only song on which Madonna left her creativity to Timberlake.  Nothing is from her.  I can imagine the video in slow motion, on a windy beach, Madonna is crying... and we are laughing cause the song is Déjà vu.     12 Voices : La question est posée \\" Who's the master, who is the slave\\".   Madonna est tout cela en même temps.    Je suis master car j'analyse mieux son oeuvre mais je suis slave de ses bons beats.   Toune de finale d'album.    12 Voices : \\" Who's the master, who is the slave\\".    The Media, Us, the lovers, Madonna ?  Well, since we love her so much, I think the public is the slave.  We have to live with this new cd in our Madonna's library of music.  This last song will be remember as the last one with Warner.   Is Madonna will her \\"Voices\\" of creativity for her new contract ? Will See.  A song that we easily forget.    I know that most American critics didn't appreciate \\"Confessions\\".  In Canada and in the Province of Quebec ( where I live ), her last album was considerate a MASTERPIECE.  The fact is : It was !  DANCE music is not popular anymore in the US.  But Confessions was a whole and Hard Candy is full of holes.   It's like different candies to please everybody.   I love Madonna's albums with a theme.  This Hard Candy wants you to have the impression that it holds together but it's not.  The stand out singles to me are : Heartbeat, Miles Away, She's not me (minus the chorus) et Beat goes on.  Those 4 songs makes the bridge from her last Confessions.  American Life was average, Confessions was perfect, Hard Candy average... let's hope the CD to come will be better.    *** on 5 stars.
B00005OAIE|1.0|John fits right in.  More of the same watered down pop princess guitar work from this overrated loser.
B000058983|5.0|Like Sgt Pepper,Blonde on Blonde, Sweet Baby James, Strange Days, Darkness on the Edge of Town, Nevermind,Beggar's Banquet, Lou Reed's New York,Pet Sounds,or Axis: Bold as Love, this is one of those landmark recordings that - regardless of what generation you are part of - you simply have to have in your life if you love great music. That Love and/or Arthur Lee are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a wrong that should be righted. And for what it's worth, even though this record is beautiful symphonic folk-rock, it can be argued they invented punk with their classic \\"7 and 7 Is\\" on Da Capo... in 1966.
B00102FELM|5.0|This was an incredible show. Ulrich Roth, Michael and Rudolf Schenker as well as Mattias Jabs kicked butt. No doubt about it. Klaus was great too. My PAL formatted DVD played well. It skipped very quickly about 4 times but it didn't interfere with the entertainment value. Whoever cut this show up though, did a very poor job. Too many 3 second close ups and then going from scene to scene. Too many crowdshots also. All these great guitarists and their solos were so poorly put together by the producers. Bad job. I still have to give it a 5 star because of the songs and energy. It's worth the [...].
6302158249|5.0|For some inexplicable reason, this incredible performance is not available on DVD! (Mr. Knopfler has since corrected this situation). Because this is Dire Straights in their PRIME, folks, on a fantastic night in London in front of diehard fans who know every molecule of the music. And for all the guitarists out there (okay, all you air guitarists too)what a banquet of virtuoso playing this is. Not to be forgotten, drummer Terry Williams turns in a performance of Keith Moon-like magnitude, as well. And all those great songs, each presented as compelling drama. This is one of those all time high water marks for quality rock and roll.

B0015D3Z4O|2.0|Alison Goldfrapp once stated that Madonna is simply riding the coat-tails of the current hip producers and I would have to agree with her when it comes to HC. I was intrigued when I heard that Madonna was working with Timbaland and those bunch. But I was also afraid of how it could turn out. I had faith in Madonna making it good because we all know she's a control freak and has good ideas at times. But I feel she has failed on this one. American Life which took years for me to get into is a masterpiece next to this one. I was chuckling when i heard her lyrics this time around thinking \\"wow, the woman has nothing to say.\\" I felt the music was inferior to what was accomplished on Justin's last studio record. This is simply a mediocre record. And it's a shame because Madonna is capable of so much more.    Advice to Madonna: You're not 25 anymore my lady. :)    Key tracks (thinking really hard now):  give it 2 me  miles away
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Unbelievable work of art.  Brilliant rythym and lead guitar work. Catchy vocals. Looking forward to the upcoming tour.  My only wish would be that they run a headlining tour, as I am sure their set will be too short. A great album for working out or getting ready to make someone pay for being an imbicile.  ie. Irish and proud.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I didn't get to see this film while it was in the theaters, but when it came to DVD, I puchased a copy without having to see the film.  I am a longtime lover of monster movies, especially the Godzilla series and like the filmakers I always felt America needed it's monster besides King Kong (and that ridiculouse excuse for a Godzilla movie in 1998).  What I found upon viewing was a very interesting approach to monster movie making.  I'm not altogether sure it works, but it still makes for a very entertaining 90 minutes.<br /><br />I like the handheld camera approach, although it can be a bit hard to watch at times.  I understand that the filmakers had to take this approach because of buget constraints.  It was very interesting to see the whole disaster unfold from the eyes of the victims.  The problem that I have with this approach is that you don't get too many chances to get a really good look at the monster.  Perhaps if a sequel is made, they could mix the handheld footage with the regular style of filmaking.<br /><br />Another problem I have is the cast with the exception of one girl was a complete waste.  I can't stand the fake pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-trendy and ultra snooty young New Yorkers and to have to suffer through these fools for the first 20 minutes was almost nauseating.  Hud was the absolute worst of the bunch and I did not find him the least bit funny.  Maybe next time out we can get a cast of characters that the public will actually care about.<br /><br />My final problem with the movie is the design of the monster.  With the way the Cloverfield monster was designed along with the color scheme they used, it's hard to tell what's an arm, what's a leg, is that a tentacle?, and where's the head.  I think the monster needed a little more defining.<br /><br />Now that all of the bad stuff is out of the way, I thought this was an exceptional monster movie and I would gladly see a sequel.  There's some very real moments of terror and the scenes of devastating destruction are just amazing, especially lady liberty's head rolling down the street.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to any monster movie fan.  It may have it's problems, but it may also be the start of a wonderful thing.zing, especially lady liberty's head rolling down the street.    I would recommend this movie to any monster movie fan.

B0015D3Z4O|2.0|It's pure manufactured sounds and computer beats no originality anymore. Madonna do an American Song Book instead so we can hear the real you.
184195392X|5.0|As I was reading this, people would stop me in airports or on the train and tell me it was one of their favorite reads of all time.   It certainly held my interest, but until the very end of the book, I did not fully appreciate the deeper meanings of this novel.  I do not want to ruin it for anyone who has not yet experienced this outstanding work, but it has so much wisdom and provides such a fine parable for the deeper meanings of life and religion that I wanted to read it again the moment I put it down.  Don't miss out on this book (and make sure you read until the last page!)
B0012E6R3W|5.0|With The Formation of Damnation, Testament delivers the thrash album of the year, hands down. Eric Peterson and Chuck Billy are rejoined by Alex Skolnick, Greg Christian and drummer Paul Bostaph to bring us the metal. Along side Slayer and Exodus, no other band has been as consistent and downright dedicated to give the fans what they want. Eric and Chuck, the heart and soul of this band, and as sadly underrated as they are portrayed, completely shine here. Old school, new school, it doesn't matter. Coming up with an album of this magnitude, takes some skill. And how Eric comes up with some of his riffs(heavy and hooky) is just amazing. Chuck, considering  the past couple of years have been pretty rough, turns in an amazing performance as well. Its also really good to have Alex and Greg back in the fold. Having said that, both seem to have a renewed spirit on this one, considering Alex has not been on an album of new material since The Ritual in '92 and Greg since Low in'94. And finally, they could not have picked a better replacement than Paul Bostaph. Considered by many as just a fill in, he owns the drums here, and fits the band like a glove. I received my copy a day early, which was an additional bonus to my already anticipated excitement. In conclusion, I was eagerly awaiting this release and it lived up to my expectations ten fold. Thrash metal fans, check it out, raise the horns, and bang til your dead.
B00102F5WK|1.0|I was eagerly waiting to view this film.  I understand all too well the horrors of relatives and friends gone missing with no explanation. This is planned and routine in all of the world ... not just in the nefarious offices and dark air hangers of the CIA! Having said that, this movie was disappointing especially given the excellent cast. It lacked substance and was full of stereo types, both left and right, us and foreign.  What a let down.
B00154GEFU|4.0|I had bought a ticket to see Asia at the House Of Blues in Dallas, TX.  It was my first Asia show.  As soon as I could I bought the Phoenix album because I couldn't wait to hear new material from them and I wanted to be familiar with the new songs when I saw them live.  I will say this is an amazing album.  This is actualy probably their best one sice their first album.  I really love some of the songs on here.  The musicianship is tight and John's voice is as good as ever.  Never Again starts the album off and is the first single from the album.  It's a great rocker and I loved hearing them do it live. It might be my favorite song on the album.  Nothing's Forever is another good rock tune that I like hearing. Heroine is where the ballads start to come in and this is why the album loses a star.  Now I could have done without ballads on this album as I can't stand ballads and this album has two of them. Sleeping Giant/No Way Back/Reprise get's the rock going again which starts out as a mellow piece which makes me think of midevil times then going into No Way Back the album rocks again.  Alibis is ok but nothing really special.  I Will Remember You is another ballad and one I hit the skip button for.  Shadow Of A Doubt is another good song which is very upbeat.  Parallel Worlds/Vortex/Deya is pretty good starting of as a slow song then getting into a keyboard driven song and then a mellow piece.  Wish I'd Known All Along is another good upbeat song which Steve Howe sings harmonies on.  Orchard Of Mines I really like it's slow and mellow but very relaxing. Over And Over is the most forgettable one on here as the piece doesen't do anything for me at all.  And we close the album with An Extraordinary Life which os a good upbeat song with a very positive vibe.  When I saw Asia I felt it was a very religious experience for me.  I drove Three hours for the concert and it was totaly worth it being the best concert I had ever seen in my life.  Here is a spoiler though if anyone is planing on seeing Asia on their Phoenix tour definetly go but they only play Two songs from this album.  Never Again and An Extraordinary Life.  That was my only gripe about the show but it's very minor.  I would have loved to hear a couple more songs live but the show was still amazing.  I hope they will continue to play for a long time and I hope that wasn't my last Asia show.  Excellent album people.  Buy it.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|American Gangster is among the best movies I have ever seen. So far I have watched only the extended version several times and there is not a single scene I want to miss. It's almost 3 hours in length but never loses suspense.  Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington are brilliant in their lead roles. Their acting is superb. Cinematography and sound track are great, just as story line and dialogue.  All the other characters are well chosen and well developed.  There is nothing to criticize, nothing to get hung up on. It's a movie like Good Fellas. One of a kind and among the best.  All I can do is highly recommend this film. Don't miss it.
0930289528|4.0|Jazzed by the movie, I bought the book and then let it sit around for a couple of years while other matters took precedence.  Maybe I should have struck while the iron was hot because when I took up V FOR VENDETTA recently it seemed listless and drawn out to an excruciating degree.  That said, I must admit that if I hadn't have seen the film I might have been more taken by Alan Moore's concept and David Lloyd's execution.  It's great to have a comic dealing so openly and forcefully with anarchy-related materials, but if you ask me, the movie upped the ante in every respect; the movie made the Shadow Gallery the palace of art, music and culture it was meant to be, the privations of the outside world more real, more chilling.<br /><br />I know people say that the movie is inferior in that V and Evey are more heroic and lack the complex moral shadings the book gives them.  But what some see as \\"complex moral shadings\\" others might view as maddeningly etiolated monologues with no visible point.  The chief plot twist is kept in the movie, where it's just as unbelievable--that V would torment Evey strikes me as absurd--but luckily some of the cheaply conceived, lackluster \\"Advise and Consent\\"-style subplots of the book were dropped entirely.  The inner torment of Rose Almond for example.  Moore does his best to make her struggle interesting but, well, it's not.  Ditto with the sexual power games of Helen Heyer.  Could anything be duller than this allegedly Marat-Sade affair?  Later on, Moore got good at writing about women but here he's all ideas, ideas ill-suitedly sharing a bed with a wanky titillation.<br /><br />And please, like everyone else I must register a protest against the horrible printing of the book.  You can barely make out what's happening in fully a quarter of the pages.  They should give you at least 25 per cent off the cover price, for 25 per cent is illegible, murky, muddy.  They should be ashamed to offer this as a product.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|It's been a very long three years, since Madonna released her future-like Disco album, CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR. When I bought that album and listened to it in its entirety, I thought Madonna had released her greatest piece of work, and that no future Madonna album would sound as brilliant as CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR. Man, was I wrong. I was literally not expecting this album to be much, since I'm not a fan of Hip-Hop/R&B. Though, CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR is an awesome album, HARD CANDY is incredibly outstanding, and in my opinion, sounds even better.    CANDY SHOP    I do find it this song to be a little strange, especially to be the album's opening track, but I couldn't help myself when I found myself bouncing my head to this one. Great track.    4 MINUTES (performed by Madonna, Justin Timberlake, & Timbaland)    The album's first single. I wasn't sure how to react when I found about Madonna working with Justin and Timbaland, since they are in two different worlds of music. But after hearing this track, I thought it was one of the best moves Madonna had ever made. This is a great song, and I was shocked that it shot straight up to the #3 position here on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.    GIVE IT 2 ME    The album's second single. I danced a bit, while I listening to this track for the first time.    HEARTBEAT    What a track! One of the best on this album.    MILES AWAY    The album's third single. An awesome track.    SHE'S NOT ME (performed by Madonna & Pharrell Williams)    Awesome track. To me, it sounds like a sequel to an earlier Madonna track: \\"Thief Of Hearts\\", which can be found on Madonna's 1992 album, EROTICA. By the way, the album credits may not say so, but this track is, indeed, a duet between Madonna and Pharrell. It's apparent that he does have one verse to himself.    INCREDIBLE    Though, I like this track, I find it to be particularly weaker than the other tracks. But I still find this track to be pretty cool.    BEAT GOES ON (performedby Madonna, Kanye West, & Pharrell Williams)    I couldn't wait to hear this track, while I was waiting for the album's release. Let me tell you now that waiting all that time was well worth the wait. This song is definitely one of my all-time favorites from this album. So far, I've listened to this song at least five times in a row. BTW: The album credits may only credit Kanye West as the only guest performer on this song, but it should be pointed out that Pharrell's vocals are heard as well, during the choruses.    DANCE 2NIGHT (performed by Madonna & Justin Timberlake)    The album credits may not say so, but this track is a definite duet between Madonna and Justin. Like \\"Beat Goes On\\", I played this song five times in a row, since I've heard it. This is another song I found myself bouncing my head and dancing to.    SPANISH LESSON    It's been ... 19 years since Madonna recorded a Spanish-like song. I heard that this song was not much, but I wanted to hear it for myself, anyway, to make my own decision. I was glad I did, because this is a great track. It's no \\"La Isla Bonita\\" or \\"Spanish Eyes\\", but this track is still worth the listen.    DEVIL WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU    As you all may remember, Madonna was supposed to have performed this song, during her 2004 \\"Re-Invention Tour\\", but decided to drop it from the final setlist. After hearing this song for the first time, I immediately fell in love with it, where it became another all-time faovorite of mine. I love the idea of Madonna combining this song with a Classical & Hip-Hop/R&B sound.    VOICES    A great way to end this album. Great track.
B0014KD46W|4.0|I bought this album last night and found myself listening to certain tracks and skipping over some.Thats what I do.Although I was concentrating on other things I did manage to get my thoughts together.It opens with a catchy beginning then decends into a more bluesy traffic material.This album was more clearer than Its about Time which was badly produced.Its a TRAFFIC album not the High Life keyboardy songs from the eighties.I love TRAFFIC....This will grow on you.

B000R8YC18|5.0|I first saw Taxi Driver when it was released in the mid 1970s (over 30 years ago!), and was amazed then at DeNiro as an actor and the movie as a whole. The movie was so fascinating to me back then as a youngster that I remember dragging my girlfriend to the movie theatre at least 6-7 times to see it over and over. I just got the double DVD set and am re-amazed (is that a word?) at DeNiro's acting and again , with the movie as a movie. This is a film that you need to watch several times to take it all in. As for DeNiro - in my opinion, the best actor ever (forget the wasted performances in Meet the Parents, the Flockers, etc.), watch his facial expressions, catch his voice mannerisms, etc., and I think you'll agree he really nailed the part of a man who is a little off to start and whose life spirals downhill. Screenwriter Paul Schrader's commentary (on disc 2) on society's fixation with fame/media, and with making anybody a \\"hero\\", even a killer, is even more applicable today. This is a fascinating movie, really one of a kind. The 2 disc set also gives you a 2d DVD with over 2 hours of really enetertaining documentary/commentary on how the movie was made.
0736063684|5.0|I just ordered this book of Amazon and already received it. This is definatly the best Strength Training book published. It shows 100s of workouts for all parts of your body including your arms, legs, buttocks, back, chest, abdomen, and shoulders. Now, I am 13 years old and I am currently lifting weights, so since Im younger than most guys, I like to make sure I know what Im doing so I dont hurt myself, and this book gives me it all. It tells me how to do workouts, different ways of doing them, what muscles it mainly works, and it even informs you on possible injuries.    I recommend this to anyone intrested in getting a Strength Training book
B000MRAAJM|5.0|My appreciation for this series is primarily derived from the fact that it shows us things most people have never seen before, and my experience is that never fails to evoke involuntary--and frequent--gasps of wonder from all who view it. I also feel some sadness with respect to the series, because I feel it makes an apt and beautiful epitaph for the planet we seem to be irrevocably destroying. I know this is a little nutty, but I hope that if we utterly decimate our planet and most of its inhabitants, that somehow this series survives us as a testament to what was once here.
B00005CDUE|5.0|This is really good music.  This CD represents a 10 year period 1972-1982 and 9 albums by this band.  They evolved in their sound but this happens to a lot of bands and I can think of many that \\"evolved\\" for the worst compared to their early albums such as Chicago, REO Speedwagon, Talking Heads, the Stones, Madonna, Van Halen, Dire Straits, Alan Parsons, the Doors, Fleetwood Mac, Black Sabbath - should I go on?  But this band, with 17 of the 18 songs on this CD penned by Brian Ferry, changed style but still maintained high quality and appeal throughout.  The later songs in their career that are first on this CD were more easy listening than their early career but I still sense an urgency and tension in them.  I have always loved \\"Avalon\\" and \\"More Than This\\" but \\"Over You\\" has great guitar, piano and sax parts, and \\"Same Old Scene\\" starts with a tense interplay between the synth and horns all backed by punchy drums and bass.  \\"Oh Yeah\\" (track 6), \\"Angel Eyes\\" (track 7), and \\"Dance Away\\" (track 8) are a little too light and/or slow for my taste, but this is the only dip in the CD and none of these 3 songs from 1979-1980 are sickly over-produced like some of Chicago's stuff from the same period.  Part of that has to do with Ferry's appealing vocals.    The later songs on the CD (tracks 9-18) that represent their earlier albums from 1972-1975 are more twisted and quirky and are clearly fantastic.  Songs like \\"Mother of Pearl\\" and \\"Both Ends Burning\\" really stand out.  To me all 10 of the last songs are great listening and more accessible than you might think.    The only thing that would have made this better is if they issued a 2 CD set with the best of the 1972-1975 albums on the first CD and best of 1976-1982 albums on the second CD.  That way the grumblers about either their early or late style could just listen to the CD they liked.  But to put the entire 10 year career on one CD - I don't know how it could be better.    Just an all around great CD.  Bass and drums have more punch and overall volume is greater than the Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music \\"Street Life\\" Greatest Hits CD from 1989.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I might be in the minority here, but I think Third is tremendous and is better than Dummy or their s/t album.  It could be that I've been listening to their first 2 1/2 released (Roseland included) for a decade and have been so anxious for something new that I welcomed this with overly opened arms.  I doubt that though.    This album is a journey to the center of your soul, and it lets you get lost while doing it.  I've been listening to Third for well over a month now, and with every spin, it gets better.  I'm hard pressed to pick a track that I think could possibly define Third, but if I must do so, I say it has to be Small.  Beth lures us in with her smooth, hypnotizing voice at first, and like the rest of the album....you can get lost in bliss.    Buy it.  Buy it now and embrace Portishead for being so amazingly sharp after after abandoning us for nearly 10 years....welcome back, P

B000Y8GFY8|5.0|It is, I believe, very hard to argue that \\"Clowns\\", the lovely and complex opener to Seventh Tree, isn't a song about breasts:    Only clowns would play with those balloons  what do you want to look like Barbie for?  Titties that go on and on, on and on    That the lyrics are mumbly and indistinct, while the lyrics are bravely printed inside, is further evidence that the artist intended to hide the message beneath waves of haunting string arrangement and folksy soprano crooning.    Perhaps the real message, after the success of Supernature and its bit of TV sync candy \\"Ooh La La\\", is that Goldfrapp doesn't want to be reduced to a pile of breasts and analog synth hooks. Want me to install a couple of fake ones? Jiggle on stage and snag another Mitsubishi spot or two? No thank you, sir; only clowns would play with those balloons.    It's a terrific album at nearly every turn. Will Gregory's composition is timely and delicious. \\"Happiness\\" and \\"Little Bird\\" are also standouts. If you liked Zero 7's \\"The Garden\\", you'll like \\"Seventh Tree\\".
B0002S94OS|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. I actually bought this album on a whim, not knowing what to expect and I was definitely not disappointed. Every song is unique and exciting. I would DEFINITELY buy this cd again. It's worth its weight in gold!
B0015YDK1Q|4.0|As a big fan of Maná, I was excited for the new release. It is a live album and I think that Maná shines live. Their two other live efforts are great \\"unplugged\\" and \\"Maná en vivo\\". The only complaint is that there is not as much material as on \\"Maná en vivo\\". Great versions of the newer songs as well as the classics. An updated version of \\"Vivir Sin Aire\\" at the end of \\"Bendita Tu Luz\\" was a good surprise, great to see that they can bring new life to the classic. Once I got it I listened to it over and over again.  [[ASIN:B0015YDK1Q Arde el Cielo (CD + DVD)]]
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Others have covered the details sufficiently, so I will stick to a simple review.  This sequel was one of those rare films that was as good as the original in every aspect.

This book is a must-read for all those with wanderlust and a sense of humor.
B0007XT87G|5.0|There are others here who can give (and have given) much better reviews for this album.  So I don't know how helpful this will be to anyone who's contemplating buying it.  I'm only going to give my gut, emotional reaction to it, as opposed to a logical analysis of why each song is so spectacular.  See....the music on this album goes beyond logical analysis.  It hits you right in the emotional solar plexus.  Especially after you play it several times through and let it wash over you (and especially as you get into the fifth track throgh the end.  BTW....keep the CD playing.  There is a hidden track after the end.  And yeah...it's a stand out track just as much as the other ones are).    I'm a fan of many different types of music and I came across this album because Steve Wilson has been involved with one of my favorite metal bands, Opeth.  So I kinda picked it up sight unseen only because of this association (And because Mikeal Akerfeldt of Opeth admires him so much.  I personally think that Akerfeldt is a musical genius, so I take his recommendations to heart).    I think I have found a perfect album.  I really do.  It was as though Steve Wilson took all of the best parts of my favorite bands (A little bit of Coldplay, maybe some Radiohead, a little Pink Floyd, a bit of Dream Theater, maybe some Rush, even some Peter Gabriel and Beck and yes....even some Opeth...miunus the growls, of course) and mixed it all up and put his own special brilliant spin onto it and created...the perfect album.    Perfect from start to finish.  Every song is fantastic.  No filler whatsoever.  Great lyrics, great musicianaship and perfect arrangements.    Not a very helpful review is it?  No, I can't logcally tell you why this album has reached in and grabbed my heart and won't let go.  Maybe...hopefully...it will do the same for you.      If  you're contemplating getting this album....take a risk and get it.  Perhaps you'll see the same magic in Steve Wilson and Porcupine Tree as I do.

B000N6TX22|4.0|If you're expecting a fantasy like \\"Enchanted\\", stay away from this film but if you want a cautionary tale of the future like \\"Blade Runner\\", check this one out.  This was one of the best films of 2006 and that's due to excellent direction and a steller cast headed by Clive Owen, Julianne Moore & Michael Caine in role inspired by John Lennon. I haven't read the book but after seeing this fine film, I will definitely search it out.  The immigration and the over-population problems shown in this film hit close to home.  I hesitated in seeing this film late at night after work but the reality of this film really woke me up!! This film in HD DVD since after seeing it a second time, I was amazed at the visual richness this film actually has!!  Totally recommended for fans of sci-fi and \\"Blade Runner\\" fans (Bush and other politicos be aware of what you're doing to this planet!!) The HD-DVD transfer gives you a \\"you are there\\" look too.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|I'm always impressed when a band lies dormant for an extended period of time and is able; somehow, to recapture their creative magic long after their alleged artistic peak has past.  Portishead hasn't released a proper album in 11 years, and somehow they were able to release something as good, as haunting, and as evocative as Third over a decade later.    Where bands like Mission of Burma and Dinosaur Jr. basically picked up where they left off when they disbanded, Portishead does anything but.  Portishead is so synonymous with the term trip hop and all it's trappings that simply making another album similar to Dummy would have gotten them labeled as a retread or worst, outdated.  Third is a much more stark and claustrophobic album than Dummy or their self titled follow-up.  Gone are any scratches, oversized drum beats, or any other remnants of hip hop influence in their sound.  It sounds a lot more rough and lo-fi, focusing on texture and tension, instead of the relatively warm and inviting sound of their first two albums.  Guitars are much more prominent and Beth Gibbon's voice sounds half buried most of the time.  Where Dummy and their second album were made for relaxing late at night, listening to Third is about as comfortable as walking in a hailstorm.      The opener Silence starts off with a voice speaking in Portuguese, and for some reason it set me on edge.  The rest of Silence builds tension with a throbbing drum beat and swelling strings.  The song keeps building and building and them it abruptly cuts off, leaving you wanting some kind of resolution that never comes.  The whole album seems built on this jerky sequencing that bounces you between different tempos and moods, but always keeps you guessing and uncomfortable.  The best example is the trio of songs in the middle of the album, We Carry On, Deep Water, and Machine Gun.  We Carry On has this driving and taunt low end beat that keeps on moving and stuttering, punctuated by an occasional guitar lineand sheets of noise.  The next song Deep Water is a brief interlude featuring only Gibbons voice, occasional barbershop style backup singing and a ukulele.  You're sort of lulled to sleep before the dueling drum machines on Machine Gun wakes you up.  It's a masterful job of sequencing because you're only allowed to breath for a minute before being jerked back to life.  Other songs like The Rip and Small start out with Gibbons' unaccompanied by a beat before the song kicks in to gear, again jarring my senses.  It's similar in motivation, but not neccesarily technique to the GZA's Liquid Swords.  Both albums are so tense that it's hard to breath, and both have this shifting dynamic that makes it's uncomfortable to listen to.      The only drawback, and it's a minor one, are Gibbons' lyrics.  I didn't think it was possible for her to seem any more forlorn and whispy, but I guess I was wrong.  Part of this is the production, which has her voice buried or obscured in the mix a lot of the time, but her lyrics are still as bleak as they come.  It's honestly fairly easy to ignore her lyrics though because her voice is still evocative and adds to the uncomfortable mood of the music.       Third is a brilliant album and a worthy addition to their catalogue.  Right now I don't think it's as good as Dummy, but it's easily as good as their second album, maybe even better.  Over time I can see this becoming my favorite release from the band.  Third is a near masterpiece.

Why is \\"buy one, get one free\\" more effective than \\"half off\\"? Why does the pension-fund raider go free while the ATM thief goes to jail?<br /><br />Ariely, professor of Behavioral Economics at MIT, explores these and other snappy, intriguing questions, and designs clever experiments to test his ideas on people - mostly students at MIT and Berkeley. From the placebo effect to procrastination, from branding to the role of expectations, Ariely peeks behind the rationalizations of common behavior and explores the intersections and divides between our social and economic worlds.<br /><br />Many of his results are indeed predictable, (students with deadlines got better grades than those who set their own), but some are startling. In one experiment students were asked to unscramble sentences. One group received neutral sentences; the other worked on sentences about money. Afterwards both groups were given a puzzle and told they could ask for help. Those who had worked on the money-oriented sentences worked almost twice as long as their counterparts before asking for help. They were also less willing to help others and more likely to sit by themselves.<br /><br />Similarly, students were asked to write the last two digits of their social security numbers next to a list of products, then decide if they would pay that price for each item, i.e., $23 for a cordless keyboard, $23 for a box of Belgian chocolates. Next they were to indicate what their maximum bid for the item would be. The students with higher social security digits bid correspondingly more.<br /><br />Ariely also shows us that logic isn't necessarily more sensible. Though it seems logical to give yourself as much time and knowledge as possible before writing three term papers, those who chose the semester-long option performed predictably less well than those with specific deadlines.<br /><br />Amusing and personable, Ariely argues that we could save better, procrastinate less, be healthier, get more from employees and bosses and outwit advertising if we understood our irrational minds. And his thought-provoking experiments may help us do all that, at least more often.<br /><br />Potentially of greater interest, however, are the implicit questions surrounding public policy and regulation.

0525948023|4.0|Basically, I go through life and learn what I can to better myself; I just take what's useful and skip the rest. I don't have a religion or philosophy to defend, so this book did not get my back up, as it apparently did with some readers.    I found this book summarizes and reinforces my approach to life, which is generally a happy one despite the usual bumps in the road of life. I wasn't looking for a \\"solution\\"; I was killing time at an airport and picked up this book.    I don't think this book will help at all if you're not open to it. Whether you are or not is entirely up to you. Maybe you can learn similarly (or better) through other books and teachings. We all glean differently from life. I'm glad this book exists if it helps even one person out there. I'm an atheist, but if faith helps some people, I'm all for that, too. Basically, I figure if you are threatened or angered by this book, it's telling of you and your beliefs. If not, shrug, return it and move on.
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|R.E.M.'s new album ACCELERATE marks quite a change from their last, 2005's [[ASIN:B0002W4UVG Around the Sun]], the meek and keyboard-driven effort which found little following. On ACCELERATE they now present a loud, energetic front. Unfortunately, the album is a tremendous disappointment for several reasons.<br /><br />From the very first song, \\"Living Well is the Best Revenge\\", one notices that Michael Stipe's voice has greatly deteriotated. He gives here a hoarse cry instead of the more eloquent vocals of times past. Yes, even by REVEAL's \\"Beat a Drum\\" people were commenting that his voice was clearly going downhill, but it's even worse here. In terms of instrumentation, the songwriting gave more of a role to guitarist Peter Buck than on the last album, but production-wise ACCELERATE is a \\"loudness wars\\" casualty where there's no room for the sound to breathe and most of the time the guitar is overwhelmed by everything else pressed into a tiny dynamic range. Finally, the musical content of the album is extremely limited, with very basic chord progressions and nearly every track here reminiscent of something the band has already written as well as little distinguishable from the other material of the album.<br /><br />ACCELERATE is not entirely bad music if encountered on its own, but anyone familiar with any of the band's previous work will find that they are now retreading old ground, but much less successfully than before.<br /><br />I'm not one of those people who think R.E.M.'s career ended in the late '80s or early '90s. I enjoyed UP and REVEAL, for example. However, I think it would not have been a great loss if R.E.M. had already decided to retire. I don't understand this idea that the band must go on, even as album by album the cracks show larger and larger. It can't be about the money, since the members of the band are super-rich.
B00008YLV2|5.0|Black Hawk Down is indeed a story of modern warfare.  Even though it occurred 15 years ago, there is really no other comparable, true-life story of the modern U.S. military in action against an enemy that is well-matched, with sheer numbers facing technological superiority.  It is for this reason that I bought the 3-disc edition, to get the extra documentaries and commentaries.  The former I've watched, with the History channel's 2-hour documentary, with Mark Bowden's comments more interesting than the 1-hour Frontline piece.  I look forward to watching the movie again and again with the various commentaries.  After watching this movie, with it's often painful realism, other military movies seem almost unwatchable they are so cliched and Hollywood.  This is a fascinating collection of discs to watch.
B00000F6LQ|4.0|Greetings!  I've always loved this film since childhood, but I had a real problem with the packaging.  Disc One was loose in the box, with no way to secure it, but Disc Two was secured with a central hub that I absolutely could not remove the disc from to save my life.  The wheels on my car are not held as securely, and I was very concerned about breaking the disc in my attempts.  I even made a futile attempt to bang it with a coconut, to no avail.  I finally ended up sacrificing the \\"collector value\\" of the packaging and quite literally destroying the central hub with an X-Acto knife and a drill burr to remove the disc without destroying it.  Knowing Python, I could almost see this as some part of a larger joke, but not quite.  Did anyone else have this problem, or did I just purchase an unusually tenacious box, or am I just a clod?  Thanks!

I'm no fortune teller but trust me... \\"You'll See!\\" Yes, the haters do come out in droves when she releases a new record, especially when it's flying off the shelves, selling like hotcakes, they have been trying to destroy her from day ONE, but to no avail, she just keeps laughing (& dancing) all the way to the bank!    Great Party Music!
B000TGJ8A8|5.0|This is a very underated film that is entertaining and has action and suspense for everyone. Nic Cage is a hit or miss kinda actor, and this one is a hit. Of course, hes a little old to play the love interest of Jessica Biel, but other then that, its well made and worth a watch.
B0012OQZWA|5.0|One hallmark a great band is the abilty to reinvent itself--To retain core style while coming up with new and interesting means of expression. Death did this time and time again, progressing such that each album is unique with a wide variety of technical solos, fast riffs, abrasive tone, etc. and retaining a style distinctly belonging to Death even with the rather fluid line-up (thanks to frontman Chuck Schuldiner, RIP).    Based on Origin's first three albums, one would not suspect them of being so ingenious. And let's face it--they aren't. Their trademark style for three albums was technical at times but generally crude, brutal, and confoundingly fast. So much to the point that judging by their concerts I am convinced that their recording budget did not afford the full spectrum of sound to emerge on their CDs as it should have. And although they've stood out amongst their peers, the sound got somewhat diluted over the years as more bands emerged on the scene. Some of whome were actually good.    Kill to breed peace ...  confronting our worse enemy / subatomic anatomy  the Antithesis    The title track, fairly self-explanatory. Supplanting a rather elaborate journey (or sprint, rather) of complex death metal tracks showcasing the band's improved songwriting and of course their legendary speed with precision. The Antithesis track then takes the impression left after the surprisingly lengthy first nine tracks and turns it inside-out. I will leave further judgement up to the listen, but plead that they first listen to some of the previous tracks as though an apparatif to a great beer/wine.    I suspect album name \\"Antithesis\\" was chosen carefully as to have a double meaning. Possibly a reflection of the band, the death metal genre, and plans for the future. Though Origin's previous works have never been duplicated, much like similar-but-different bands such as Cryptopsy, Deicide, and The Berzerker their earlier works may have been ahead of their time and eventually lost as people got turned on to this style of metal. I believe this album marks a much needed reinvention of the band which will help them once again erupt from a genre now mostly populated by boring and uninspiring acts. Unequivocally Origin the whole way through, Antithesis lives up to its title.
0345457692|5.0|I highly recommend this book, not because of its pretty language or story but because its not.  Its gritty.  Its tactile.  You can feel the words like rough concrete pressing against your back.  The story feels like a mural of violence painted in gore looks.    The SF technology exists as a framework to support a tale of mystery, revenge, and love rather than those things existing to showcase the author's vision of the future.
0061245097|5.0|This book was worth waiting for. What can I say, chemistry is still there between those two, now even more then ever.  One complained earlier that Bones didn't seem mad at Cat for leaving him, I wasn't even expecting him to be, after all she did explained she did it for him. I was expecting relief for finding her again and that was what I got.<br />I was wondering what will be Jeaninene's solution to Bones beeng forever young and pretty, while Cat is not a full blooded vampire. And the author did find a beautiful solution to that!<br />There are some unexpected twists and turns that at the end of the day made me happy. And should leave You happy too if You like those two together. So stop sitting on your arse, get up and buy that book!<br /><br />I know it would be a tough break for the author, But I want to see books about them coming and coming!
B000R7I3LY|3.0|Just gave the record a listen.. Great voice.. almost spectacular. The record itself unfortunately fails the needle test.(The needle test refers to arm on a turntable lifting and dropping the needle onto a record. The test is does every song sound original enough to be it's own piece or does it all sound the same. This is for anyone not familiar) I'd really like to hear her first self released record as well as her future efforts. Don't get me wrong - this one has a couple of decent tunes, but its not something you can just throw in and let it play.
037582913X|5.0|We got this book for my daughter when she was a baby, and it became a family favorite almost immediately, especially when I imitated Grover's voice and read it to her. \\"Read it again, Daddy\\" was the inevitable response I would get after finishing the book, and there were times where \\"Grover\\" would read it 3-4 times a night. We gave the book away years ago, but my daughter -- who is now 18 -- said she always remembered me reading that book to her in Grover's voice. A couple of years ago, I surprised her with a miniature version of the book as a Christmas present, and we substituted the traditional family reading of \\"Twas The Night Before Christmas\\" and sat down and read the book -- in Grover's voice. Her two younger cousins, who weren't around when I read this to my daughter, laughed with their older cousin as their uncle used Grover's voice to read the story. There are so many great memories my family has of this book, and it's a fun read -- even if you can't do Grover's voice.
B0013V33DG|5.0|I regard this version as superior to the one with Ciofi because Dessay is in fact a better singer than Ciofi. Florez needs no introduction since he is the reigning light lyric tenor today. Some complain that his voice has a \\"nasal\\" quality but in fact that is simply one of its unique identifying features. Most very great singers had uncommon voices, perhaps even ones with a few \\"defects\\", that served to make them unique. Callas for example, and Melchior. There are lots of voices with nothing distinctive about them, but Florez is not in that group, fortunately. No praise is too high for his art or his unique vocal instrument.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Everyone is right... this is a very hard workout...but in a good way!  I consider myself to be in good shape and work out every day.  I have lost 50 lbs and have 5 more to go but they won't come off.  I thought how hard could 20 minutes be?  Oh my gosh... I could hardly get through it the first time!  I am adding it to my regular turbo jam and treadmill routine and I hope it gets this weight off.  So far I have only done it 5 times and it is still challenging but not nearly as bad as the 1st time.  I can't explain it really, but it is just different than any other workout DVDs I own.  Also, the moves are not awkward or complicated. Anyone should be able to do this.  I am so glad I bought it, and I can't wait to get to level 3!  If you want a new challenge, just get this DVD.  It is so inexpensive and worth every penny and then some.
B00005JPTK|3.0|I read the book. Twice. Well, not really. I read it and I listened to the unabridged audiobook. I took one look at Will Smith walking the streets of a desolated New York, playing what in the book was a blonde white dude in an equally ruined Los Angeles, and I knew that they weren't sticking to the book like glue, which is fine.     Let's be real. Will Smith is cool and New York makes for a far better wasteland than L.A.; so who cares? I don't. Monsters from L.A. would be too busy looking in the mirror, but New York monsters... New Yorkers are already creatures of the night and also rude as hell on their best days, so they'd make awesome gangrel man-eaters. Besides, I have come to accept that movies are generally never like the book, the book is always better... you know the speech.    As long as the story remains the same, the theme and the message from the book is still there, I have no gripe when filmmakers break from the book here and there. The problem is they did not bother at all. They took the title, and made some other version of \\"28 Days Later\\"     Moving right along, I'll make believe there isn't a book. I'm not going sit here and regurgitate what you read in other reviews before mine in regards to the book vs. the movie. That they didn't recreate the book 100% is not a good reason to shun this film. It's worth watching... once.    First, Will Smith is fan-tastic.     The setting and tone of the movie makes for a mild horror film that's hard not to be drawn into. Me? I love post-apocalyptic stuff. As much as I would hate to be there, I often wonder how people would cope after being stripped of everything that makes life simple for most of us. Having this guy, Robert Neville, the last human on Earth, having to compete with a new species is still interesting material. Vampires? Who needs em? We know their routine back and forth anyway. You won't miss them... unless you're a goth.    Watching Will hunting, gathering, seeing deer and stuff graze grass from thebroken pavement, being preyed upon by lions and... what were they... infected zombies, or whatever, and conversing with mannequins out of loneliness; that's just great stuff to see, and it gives the movie an emotional edge that's missing in most scary movies. I loved all of that.    They kind of failed to deliver the other half of what makes scary movies great. Don't get me wrong. There were some real tense moments; you find that these monsters aren't stupid when they lay a trap that Will stumbles into. Good stuff; some tenseness, you'll be waiting for things to jump out, and they do, but there is little violence, which yes, irked me.     I was like, \\"Come on, I get that you can't mess up the last man alive too much, but since you're doing flashbacks anyway, how about some memories of zombie rampage; people being ripped up and devoured like little turkeys, gobbling in helpless terror? Give us an idea of what Will has to look forward to if he messes up just a little.\\" Nope.     I mean, they make a movie with zombies, or whatever they were, and though it's a clear threat, they don't give us much of what makes these kinds of movies really thrilling-- blood and limb ripping.    You know what really disappoints me though? When Will is out there, in one scene, if you look up there is a movie billboard displaying the Batman symbol with Superman's crest inside of it suggesting that a Batman/Superman film was forthcoming. Stupid Emma Thomson had to make her \\"cure\\" for cancer and now both Christian Bale and Brandon Routh are frikin zombies (probably looking at themselves in the mirror somewhere in \\"infected\\" L.A.) and they never got to release what would have been a much more exciting movie than \\"I Am frickin Legend\\"!    But anyway...    As much as I think one might enjoy watching this movie once, to me, it doesn't have the kind of re-playability that would justify buying this on DVD let alone Blu-Ray. For sure, see it. The movie had its moments. I enjoyed it, but it left alot to be desired.     Forgetting that the guys who made this flick did not read the book at all and completely missed the target that the book hit hard. This movie is just okay, \\"weaksauce\\" as a friend of mine would put it.    Thanks for taking the time to read my worthless opinion, and I hope it helped.
0307237702|4.0|I believe that this is one of the easier books to read, but harder to review. It is well organized and supports its theme, which is the clearly stated in its title. Because he has become such a public figure you may think you know a little about him and what his beliefs are. In my case I was expecting a real liberal message, but was very surprised how conservative I found some of his opinions. If your counting on the 60 second sound bites on the evening news to inform you of public figures you will continue to be under informed. After reading his thoughts and beliefs I see why his message is so charismatic; it truly resounds of the \\"American Dream.\\" Even though the book shares more knowledge of his rise to prominence on the American political stage, it doesn't provide a lot of details. This is OK to me because even though I would like more background on his life, as an author he really sticks to his theme, which is the title of this book.

B000LB7G00|5.0|1st make sure you read all other reviews.  They all have pertinent information.  I'm a mechanical product developer for the aerospace industry.  Using Solidworks for 3D modeling and Mastercam for programming CNC machining centers, I find the Space Navigator priceless.  I do own the Space Pilot, and the Space Traveller and the Space Navigator.  All are worthy of their intended capability.  So if you need to design/model intriquete parts where you need to explore inside cavities to confirm interaction of mating parts, this is the tool that does make it easier and faster than any other tool in the CAD industry.  If you want to play with one for anything other serious CAD modeling, buy the cheapest one and get it out of your system.  There's no need for this device unless you're needing 3D solid model control.  As far as the differing prices, I'm equally satisfied with my $59 Navigator as I am with my $499 Space Pilot.  If you need this tool and don't need the customizable features, spend the $50+.
B000000Y27|5.0|In terms of emotional expressiveness and technical virtuosity, Wes Montgomery was either Miles Davis with a guitar or the Jimi Hendrix of jazz. His was a technique beyond technique: Fluid, nimble, layered, emotive, and unmistakable. Wes made his guitar sing in a way that few others have ever managed, letting it sculpt images and ideas out of pure sound, painting the sky with spine tingling octaves and churning chords. Released in 1960, Incredible Jazz Guitar is one of the finest expressions of Wes' sound. Like the best records by Stan Getz (or, for that matter, Sun Ra), it's a masterpiece of sustained mood and imagery. It's a smart, smokey, late-night wakeful dream, a stroll through back alleys and forgotten nightclubs and moonlit cityscapes, full of drunken reveries and idle thoughts. That's what I hear in it, anyway. I also hear warmth and humor, grace and desolation, loss and excitement, joy and sadness. I hear listless rhythms and feverish self-expression, and moaning pianos and twisting melodies that mingle jazz and blues, intellect and passion, sophistication and rawness. There are uptempo numbers like the sumptuous \\"West Coast Blues\\" and ballads as hypnotic and beautiful as \\"Polka Dots and Moonbeams.\\" One of the most perfect guitar albums ever, and every bit as powerful as In the Wee Small Hours (or, for that matter, Electric Ladyland).

0060832819|5.0|This is a story about a famous writer whose wife, a journalist, suddenly disapears.  He had become unapreciative of his partner, and has a long history of infidelity, however, this couple seemed to have an open marriage, meaning he didn't expect fidelity from her either.  A long time goes by without anybody knowing where is Esther, that's her name, but suddenly a man which whom she was last seen and whom is suspected to be her lover comes to talk to him while he was promoting his last book, books that he writes about his love for Esther and the experience he is going through since she disappeared, from then on starts a journey about knowing who Esther really was, her own journey, in the process, he rediscovered himself.  This was a man with Spiritual knowledge, but after reaching certain point had become complacent and self-indulgent.  I don't want to give the story away, only I got to tell you that since I first read The Alchemist, I have read most every book of Paulo Coelho and have never been disapointed, in all of them I have gained wisdom for my own life.  From this book I learned that very rarely we live in the present moment, and when we don't live in the present moment, is as if we are not really alive, I learned to dumped my story, the book even shares a Shamanic exercize to dump your story, in other words empty your vessel, A warrior of the Light doesn't have a past, so much energy waisted in our story that we could use for our present moment, I was reminded to be opened to new experiences and to aknowledge the feelings buried inside me, the book also teaches about forgiveness and humbleness, honesty and trust in the Divine, it talks about the Divine Femenine awakening, about signs and being alert to follown the signs the Universe gives us, trust in the Divine guidance.  As if this wasn't enough, I am sure there is more that escapes my mind at this moment and you will probably discover some more for yourself!  oh yes, and appreciation, learn and appreciatethe people in our lives!
B0018CAANG|5.0|On Queen Madonna's studio-album, her final studio CD from Warner Music (note to self: there will be a greatest hits CD out at the end of the year!), Madonna includes her worldwide hit, [[ASIN:B00171NTU4 4 Minutes]]! 4 MINUTES is Madonna's singing-anthem with her new BFF, Justin Timberlake; they both sing about how they'd like to save us all. And if that's not enough, last moth, Madonna made headlines around the world when she proclaimed that she wanted to \\"save Britney!\\" It's not easy, but if anyone can do it I'm sure it's Madonna. \\"4 Minutes\\" is a quick track that is very easy to listen to (it's no wonder Z-100 plays her lead-single every hour and every day!) The single has already reached number one in more than a dozen countries around the world, it's just a matter of time for it to top the Billboard Charts in the US. Everyone, please stand by while Madonna takes off, straight to the top of the pops. My favorite of the bonus tracks is the Give It 2 Me [Paul Oakenfold Edit]. This is a previously unreleased track that was not included on the CD. It's a great fast moving song that's mixed up perfectly. ...You will experience a merriment of emotions which run the gamut of abhorrence to delectation as you listen to this record, \\"Hard Candy.\\" This is the reason why Madonna is not just an artist, but the Defining Pioneer. With her freshest work of art, this modern-day iconoclast is both asking the question, giving the answer and simultaneously luring the listener into her den of pleasure, all at once...!
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Definitely a treat for most part but I'm not sure I like her collaboration with Timbaland and Justin , some of their songs are my least favorite including \\"4 minutes\\" which is catchy and nice untill the point it starts to repeat itself and annoy with all those horns.   \\"Devil Wouldn't Roconize You\\" is a typical Justin T ballad just with Madonna's voice , it's a good song *edited* and it does sound good on Madonna but I don't like that the song sounds like somebody else's.\\"Give it 2 me\\" is catchy but not a favorite ,I was disappointed to hear it's the second single. \\"Heartbeat\\" ,\\"Spanish Lesson\\" & \\"Voices\\" are o.k too but they sound like fillers to me though \\"Spanish Lesson\\" would probably be great for a live performance.  and now to the treats - My favorites are the the songs who have a little disco flavor in them like my most favorite \\"Beat Goes On\\" with Kanye West which is such a fun song  \\"She's Not Me\\" and \\"Dance 2night\\" which is also with JT . Other favorites are : the teazing first track \\"Candy Shop\\", the ballad \\"Miles Away\\" which reminds me her \\"American Life\\" album and the catchy and different \\"Incredible\\".There is also the bonus \\"Ring My bell\\" which is actually quite good. It's a fun album to listen while driving or working out and a nice follow up for \\"Confessions\\" , I can't wait for her next tour.
0393316041|4.0|Richard Feynman is a theoretical physicist, Nobel prize recipient on Physics, professor of Caltech, a serious academic. However, he is also a curious character and a man of many talent. This book about him is not an autobiography but are little stories on him throughout his life. There is very little about physics. Rather, it demonstrates Feynman's attitude towards everything around him.    When he was in Princeton graduate college, he was invited to a tea party at the Dean's house. The Dean's wife served him tea and asked \\"Would you like cream or lemon in your tea?\\" He said \\"I'll have both, thank you.\\", quite absent-mindedly. The response was \\"Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman.\\", the title of this book.    Feynman is curious, and this may well be an important attribute for learning. The book has detailed description of how he learned to crack safes when he was in Los Alamos participating in the Manhattan project. He learned painting for a while and had his own painting exhibition. When he was in Brazil lecturing, he learned to play frigideira in a samba band and joined the Carnival parade. He also played all-drum music for a ballet performance. With all these talent, he admitted that he did not know painting, and did not know how to read music score.    This demonstrates now one should treat work and other activities as one. There is no such thing as work-life balance for him. He did anything that interested him wholeheartedly, leading to wonderful achievement in both study, work, hobbies and entertainment. It really reminds us that playing out so-called life activities half-heartedly is a waste of time.    There are so many humourous passages in the book and I can only quote a few.    - Judging Books by Their Covers.  When he served on an advisory committee on textbooks for the government, a book publisher submitted a volume of three books for evaluation. The last one was incomplete and only the covers with some blank pages were included. To his surprise, Feynmanfound out that committee members gave good rating to the books, which exposed that they didn't even bother to read them before rating them.    - Is Electricity Fire?  He was asked by a group of young rabbis \\"Is electricity fire?\\" He was glad that the theology academics were interested in physics and went on to explain the phenomenon. However, it turned out that the rabbis were trying to abide by the doctrine that they should not use fire on Sundays and thus wanted to know if this should include all electrical appliances. Quite a disappointment for him to find out that the rabbis were not modernizing but just trying to follow ancient doctrines to the letter.    - A Touch of Brazil.  When he did some lectures in Brazil, he was amazed that the students were well prepared for the lectures. They could answer questions on the reading materials right away. However, they could not answer similar but simple questions put in another way. Feynman finally found out that the students memorized all the papers distributed, as well as all the notes of the lectures. They learned without thinking, read without understanding. There is a familiar situation in Hong Kong where students did the same. We also seldom have questions asked, topic discussed, or even intellectual arguments.    - Cargo Cult Science.  On scientific studies, Feynman quoted an example. Islanders of a South Pacific Island saw what the army did there in the war: cargo planes landing bringing all sort of good things. A few decades later, they were found constructing long and flat mud strip with torches on both sides mimicking a runway. The leader would sit in a wooden shed, with wooden plates covering his ears like a headphone. They kept doing this but still wondered why the cargo planes never landed. They used accurate scientific observation and imitated the original way to near likeness. But such superficial scientific method without reasoning could not yield any results.    Stories in the book are so diverse and Icould only quote 1% of them in the review. You are recommended to take a look.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna's latest album, Hard Candy, is pure and sugary sweet pop/dance perfection!  I didn't think Madonna could top her last big dance offering of \\"Confessions,\\" but she goes further with her latest group of songs.  While I love Confessions, Hard Candy goes above and beyond with its demands for you to get up on the dance floor!      As the opening song \\"Candy Shop\\" tells you, this album has something for everyone.  After only one full listen to the album, \\"Give it 2 Me,\\" \\"Incredible,\\" and \\"She's Not Me,\\" stuck out the most.  I couldn't get these songs out of my head all day long (and still can't).  I wasn't sold on \\"Give it 2 Me\\" as a second single ... but now, after realizing how infectiously fun it is, I understand why it will be released next.  It's such a catchy, dance anthem that will convince listeners they can do anything!      On \\"She's Not Me,\\" we hear Madonna battle it out with a girl who's trying to steal her style.  I've not heard Madonna sound this sassy since the \\"Erotica\\" years.      \\"Incredible\\" is a very bright and sunny song with some incredible hooks .. I can't get the \\"can't get my head around it - I need to think about it\\" out of my head.      \\"4 Minutes,\\" while a great lead single, doesn't really give you an idea of what the rest of the album has to offer.  The production on this song is off the chain, however, and the video is top-notch!    \\"Miles Away\\" will likely be a single and is probably as close to a ballad as this album comes.  In it, Madonna laments about how two lovers are better when they're far apart.      Lyrically, \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and \\"Voices\\" are probably the strongest songs.  In \\"Voices,\\" we're asked, \\"who is the master, who is the slave?\\" .... and, once again, Madonna has proven she is the master at this whole thing we call Pop.      Madonna sounds so down to earth and energized on Hard Candy.  I haven't heard her have this much fun since her early 80s dance craze.  If you're looking for a great banger of an album to dance to, pick up Hard Candy right now!
0307265730|5.0|The view of some that Lahiri's latest book is a retread inspires me to respond and defend this extraordinary writer. While it is true that she revisits characters with many similarities in profile (American-born of Bengali heritage, well-educated, often in the Boston area), it is my view that this strengthens her tales. By focusing on a specific and in some ways narrowly defined population, she is able to dig far deeper into the shared human experience underlying their outer trappings. So what if a character went to an Ivy League school? If her sibling is alcoholic, if she bought and hid for him beer when he was a teen, her guilt can be universally understood. The depth of her empathy and knowingness about human nature and the dynamics of relationships always leaves me breathless. At the end of this book I had tears in my eyes, feeling that I'd grown up with Hema and Kaushik,  knew them that well, and had now seen a real event intervene in their lives. Her writing may not be for everyone, but make no mistake, her focus is not narrow but very deep.

Personally, I'm not a fan of re-mixing songs, but the re-mixed ones in this case are still good, though I guess preferably, I would have wanted the originals, as the fans came to know them. Pretty good compilation, all in all.
0805079831|2.0|This book was a huge disappointment for me.  The author's crime?  The author is clearly biased and/or has an agenda, and thus loses all journalistic credibility.  The tragedy is the author's topic deserves legitimacy.  I gave her two stars because she tackled some difficult issues and topics that needed to brought the public conscious.    I got the sense the author was withholding information/facts that opposed her agenda.  On the flipside, I felt that she portrayed just enough information or rearranged information to further her biased argument.     Case in point is her chapter on Poland.  For the whole chapter on Poland, she reports very little information on the previous Communist government.  She spends significant amount of the chapter on what the government was like after Communism fell.  She goes into length of the outcomes that resulted from the strategy and policy implemented by the new government.  When reading these outcomes by themselves, they seem down right awful.  In reality, these outcomes \\"may\\" indeed have been horrendous!  But...     She reports very little on what the government was like before Communism.  She goes into little depth of the outcomes that resulted from the strategy and policy implemented by Communist government.     How can we judge if something is better or worse without comparing?  Please forgive the simple anecdote - The only reason I have had a good meal is because I have a bad meal - I hope you get the point.       On page 175, in the Chapter on Poland, she writes: \\"The Communist had been mismanaging the economy for decades, make one disastrous, expensive mistake after another, and it was at the point of collapse.\\"  Besides a few more sentences (five at the max) on the Poland during communism, the whole chapter, pages 171 to 193, are devoted to what happened immediately after communism fell.  This is not fair reporting.    Another crime, the author performs zero reporting on the current status of the Poland economy.  How can you make no mention of the current Poland economy?  Again, not fair reporting.    Lastly, the author at times takes cheap shots at some of subjects in her book.  If deserved or not, if true or not, they have no place in a journalistic book.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Artistically this band takes a huge stride forward with this album, and I applaud them for that. I've been a fan of Green Day's since there were 5 members (and Billy Joe wasn't yet with them) back in their early days in the Bay Area in the mid 80's. This was before they had done much of anything in the way of original music, and a few years before 1000 Hours, 39 Smooth, and Slappy were released. I watched them break up and reform with Billy Joe as their lead singer and only Mike and Tre remaining of the original group.<br /><br />I loved pretty much every song they ever released up through Warning. I didn't mind that they were a 1-trick pony, and I was glad when they said they were proud of only knowing 3 cords. They were living proof that there was more to music than simply technical talent with the instrument or a pretty voice. They knew how to write good melodies with great hooks, and make people want more, and their sales proved they could do it. They sold out, yes. They were no longer an underground favorite, they were no longer real punk. But they were great none-the-less.<br /><br />With American Idiot they changed though... they became pop-culture musicians. The type that care about their appearance, and doing something new to 'satisfy their fans', if it hadn't been for their return to raging at current day politics which has always been a staple for real punk rock they'd have left it completely behind. I'd never been a fan of Green Day's political rants and I was sorely disappointed to see that facet of their music return.<br /><br />It completely turned me off from them. Now I love Green Day still, they're the best mainstream punk band out there (Though Ignition and Smash by the Offspring were better than the best of Green Day) but I dread hearing anything more from them, and I can't tolerate anymore than just a song or two from this CD.<br /><br />Bands that want to spout off about their political beliefs, especially those that don't try to educate themselves in the field, do nothing but shoot themselves in foot... that or endear themselves to other people that like to do the same. No, I don't like our president either, but the last thing I want to listen to in my music is someone ranting about our culture as if they know what they're talking about.<br /><br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Give Me Novacaine, and Wake me up when September Ends are great songs, but the rest I would be happy never listening to again.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I've read all the reviews here of this album so far and they're all at one end of the spectrum or the other.  People either Love or Hate this album.<br /><br />My opinion is that Hard Candy is not one of Madonna's better albums, but it's not all bad.  This album definitely has a strong urban flavour that, while contemporary, seems a little contrived.  I'm not a huge fan of hip-hop's stop-go mid bass beats, and this album has a lot of that.  It has a herky-jerky rhythm that doesn't flow smoothly like all of Madonna's previous albums.  Be they pop, disco, or electronic they all featured thrumming flowing dancey beats.  It's an underlying sonic signature that has made most of Madonna's previous albums work.  For the most part it's absent here.  It was also absent on many tracks of American Life, and though those albums are quite different, I'd rank them beside each other near the bottom of my Madonna list.<br /><br />That being said, there are a few tracks which are still catchy and will keep some of the old Madonna fans interested, even if it doesn't appeal to many of the others.  The new sound may also garner Madonna some new younger fans too, and that's not a bad thing at all.<br /><br />If you like Urban / Hip Hop music you may like this, or you may think Madonna is pathetic for trying this.<br /><br />If you're not a huge Hip Hop fan but a Madonna fan you still may find a lot to like in this album, or you'll hate it and pine for another Confessions.<br /><br />It's a very polarizing album, so you should definitely listen to it all before making the decision to buy it!<br /><br />Myself, I'd love to see Madonna try a Rock album next.  I think that has potential to sound alarmingly good.
1400034779|3.0|Like others who reviewed this book, I picked it up because it's been so popular.  One sees it everywhere in bookstores.  Also like others, I hesitated to buy it because the most popular novels are rarely that good.  Unfortunately, that is the case here.  First, it's not really a novel.  It's a series of stories and vignettes strung together by the underlying theme of Precious Ramotswe who spends her legacy from her father by starting The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  In Africa no less, where patriarchy is the order of the day.    In many ways Mma Ramotswe is an interesting person and if any of the characters she meets were better developed, they would be interesting too.  The dialogue is what sort of stops one in their tracks.  Simple, childlike, pleasant, etc., and boring.  That and the childlike people who make up most of the characters, make this book condescending and more of a children's book than an adult read.  Some of the crimes are brutal and nasty -- like the boy who is snatched from a road at night -- but the perpetrators are by and large not punished or even revealed to authorities.    Almost worse than any of the foregoing, Mma Ramotswe is never wrong.  She never makes a mistake.  Even her little white van keeps running in spite of the roads she takes.  (Plus it never has to be filled with gas.)  I wanted to like this book and as I started reading I wanted to Like the main character.  I just couldn't find any of it believable.  Too bad.  The premise is an interesting one.  The locale could be wonderfully explored.  It is a quick read, requiring little thought or contemplation, but reading old Agatha Christie mysteries is more fun.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I can't stand most chic flicks.  I hate saying outloud to the characters in a movie \\"why don't you just say/do {insert logical suggestion here}\\".  What I love about this movie is that it is sweet and sappy but not in a manner that makes me want to shove my finger down my throat afterward.  The film takes a look at several different angles we see every day in relationships and not all of them are happy nor are all of them ever resolved.  The humanity included, however, is what appeals to me most.      Unlike critics who see this film as a dramatization of commercial Christmas at its worst combined with weak writing, I see several fun, imaginative, (even if not believable) and witty dramas tied up in a nifty little package.  I love the dry humor and the music is thoughtful and appropriate.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Confectionery magnificence... This collection marries the old with the innovative, cutting edge sound and stylization we've come to expect from her Madge-esty! It's all about the dancing, from beginning to end... no deep thoughts, no preaching or teaching or solving the world's issues... just good old-fashioned dance floor escapism! She's got the beat and she's perfectly on target with this latest offering... HC will translate well in all of the countries where Madonna rules the charts and club scenes... brilliant marketing as always and very universal in its appeal, recapturing the American audiences of past, to boot! (BTW... Nice Boots!) Watch her as she breaks even more records for music sales, digital and traditional, plus stay tuned as her forthcoming tour shatters all existing records as well... \\"goody-goody gumdrops\\" this Hard Candy is red-hot cinnamon, with great surprise at the center of each colorful lollipop (how many licks does it take?) and the flavor, just like the beat goes on and on and on!     Turkish Delight was never quite this good!    Bravo!!!!!
0525950079|5.0|If you enjoyed Pillar's Of The Earth - you'll love this! A story on it's own, so no need to read the first book to really enjoy it. This I found better than Pillar's of the earth - for such a volumous book it sure doesn't take long to read !
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Well, this album is not hip hop. Far from it. News of this collaboration scared me. For one, Madonna is always so hands on with her records.  Would T/T allow that? I don't think they had a choice.  This is a Madonna album through and through. And the collaboration works. The one thing i am very thankful for is that Timbaland?Timberlake didn't ruin this album as they did Duran Duran's last album.    My taste in music runs rampid.  I love it all. Well, most of it.  I have enjoyed Madonna since day one. I am a fan.  HOWEVER - I do not always enjoy Madonna's entire albums. There are maybe two that I like in their entirety. \\"Hard Candy\\" is the third.    Out of the 12 songs on here, I'd have to say 6 (\\"Devil..., Miles Away, Heartbeat, Candy Shop,Give it to me, and 4 Minutes\\")are among the best of her entire catalog.  That's half the album, and more than any other album of hers.In my opinion. It is great to hear her sing a haunting ballad again.  \\"Devil...\\" is absolutely gorgeous. So what if it sounds like JT's \\"What Goes Around\\"?   \\"Miles Away\\" hits home with me and with anyone else that may be in a long distance relationship. After being in a 5 year relationship, I had to move to another state.  Listening to that song raises the hair on the back of my neck.  That's what good music is about. Relating to it.  \\"Heartbeat\\", to me, sounds like \\"lucky Star\\" for the new millinium.  And who wouldn't love that.    Is every song perfect? No. Some of my least favorite songs here (Voices, Beat Goes On, Dance 2night) are not bad by any means but the are growers. For sure.  The long and the short of it is.....This is a great Madonna record.  Really, it's a great record, period. It is a feel good, light, fun album.  Full of catchy sing along melodies that a corpse can dance to.  Isn't this what we really need right now? And most importantly, Madonna's voice has never sounded better. She sounds very comfortable singing these songs.  On a last note, I'd like to say...I don't know why Americans are so weary of Madonna and judge every move she makes. Wether you like her music or not, she has a 25 year career that has been consistant. A lot more so than someone that has been around half as long. Wether her albums are \\"good\\" or \\"Bad\\", at least they are not crap.  They have all been unique and enjoyable in their own way. We should have more entertainers like this. And last but not least, stop the comparisons to Mariah Carey.  They are ridiculous. The two have nothing in common musically.  It's all a matter of taste.  But as far as icons go, this isn't like comparing Brittney to Christina (circa 2001). This is Madonna. No one even comes close.
0312379293|5.0|Great read. Hooked from the start with his excellent story line and underdog characters. The ending kept you guessing - loved it. Only downside - I read it way to quickly!
B000NA2BEU|4.0|I enjoyed the third season of \\"Veronica Mars\\".  The new college setting added freshness to an already energetic series, and the mix of storylines- some long, some short- kept things unpredictable.  This time we get a couple of long storylines, one or two shorter ones, and a bunch of stand-alone episodes.  Things worked fine on this score, except for maybe the couple of episodes where the dean-getting-murdered storyline overlapped with the coach-getting-murdered storyline: when Veronica and her dad were discussing clues during these episodes, sometimes it was hard to tell what case they were talking about.  But that's a quibble.<br /><br />Along with the college backdrop, other elements lend a new maturity to the proceedings.  For instance, we see several examples of life not being fair despite one's best efforts.  In particular, I'm thinking of the latest developments in Frank Capra's Weevil character.  Tough and smart during the first two seasons, Weevil's street cred is not serving him well as he gets older.  Here's he's a downtrodden maintenance man at the college, watching as Veronica and her friends rocket past him toward seemingly limitless opportunities.  It's sad to see, but unfortunately realistic.  The new, slower, more melancholy version of the show's familiar theme song underscores this and other less-than-bucolic developments during this final season.<br /><br />Speaking of that, all major plotlines are wrapped up by season's end, though a few smaller ones remain unresolved (Keith's professional future, Veronica's romantic future, plus one or two other things).  The mood of the final scene- Veronica walking off into the distance- is uncertain, again contributing to this season's unsure, indeterminate flavor.<br /><br />So is this season a downer?  Not at all.  Things are happening for Veronica and her new aspiring-NPR-announcer boyfriend, and even some of the goofier characters gain a little wisdom (yes, even surfer dude Dick).  But amid the opportunities and the growth, the melancholy is palpable, if relieved on occasion.  And, of course, knowing that the show wasn't renewed for a fourth season is yet another underscoring of that theme.<br /><br />In closing, as we're all enjoying this final DVD set of \\"Veronica Mars\\", here's an appeal: we're not getting a fourth season of the show, and we're not getting that re-vamped, jump-ahead-a-few-years \\"Veronica at the FBI\\" show, either (as seen in the special features, the latter was a last-ditch effort to preserve the series in at least some form).  So, you powers-that-be out there, how about a final TV movie or two to get some real closure instead of the semi-closure we have now?  At least it might give us a chance to see- unrealistic or not- poor Weevil move onto something more productive than mopping floors.<br /><br />But, if that doesn't happen, my thanks to the show's creative team for three entertaining, provocative seasons.  We could've done worse.elancholy is palpable, if relieved on occasion.  And, of course, knowing that the show wasn't renewed for a fourth season is yet another underscoring of that theme.

B0015D3Z4O|1.0|It's hard to be less relevant than Mariah Carey, but Madonna has nailed it to the floor. At a certain point, you should know that when you seem to be struggling to be the next Cher, it might be time to just et the haggis. There is nothing to recommend this, which is essentially audio wallpaper for the overweight ladies at Curves. Sad, really...

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Everyone likes candy right? From the moment it hits your tongue, candy will flood your mouth with many flavours: savoury, tart, tantalizing. You close your eyes and are transported to another world full of sweet delights and sugary pleasure.<br /><br />Such is the case with Madonna's new album, Hard Candy. As soon as the first note plays, you know you're in for a sensational treat. Mixing R and B with hip hop, pop and some good old 1980's funk, Hard Candy is a flat out amazing musical experience.<br /><br />After Confessions on a Dance Floor, I was wondering what Madonna's next musical offering would be like. She is constantly reinventing herself to stay ahead and on top in the world of music. Going from electronica (Ray of Light) to electronic country pop (Music) to hard core electronic funk (American Life) to neo-disco pop (Confessions on a Dance Floor), Madonna is constantly changing and evolving.<br /><br />Many were worried about what Hard Candy would be like when rumours started floating around about an R and B influence. Madonna, who is known to work with influential producers, worked with Justin Timberlake, Timberland, The Neptunes and Nate Hills this time around. Many felt that the album would sub par and I worried that Hard Candy would not be as good as Confessions on a Dance Floor.<br /><br />I needn't have worried. Hardy Candy is perhaps the most ambitious musical offering that she has ever done. It is also without a doubt her best work to date. Far from being an attempt to harness the urban market, it actually goes beyond the ideals of urban hip-hop and R and B. In true Madonna fashion, she makes the music her own.<br /><br />Unlike Confessions on a Dance Floor where the songs were somewhat similar and flowed into each other from one to the next, Hard Candy is a musical candy box full of different delights and startling treats. Each song on the album has a different flavour, a different sound but somehow manages to work well; each song plays off the other songs and, collected together, give us a sticky and sweet musical tapestry.<br /><br />What I love most about Hard Candy is its message: get up and dance. The theme runs through out the album but is especially notable on Give it 2 Me, Beat Goes On, Spanish Lesson, Heartbeat and Dance 2Night. There are no political or personal agendas here; instead, we are given twelve tracks that will make you want to get out on the dance floor and strut your stuff.<br /><br />There are tons of musical surprises on Hard Candy. Just when you think a song will go one way, it veers off into an unexpected yet wonderful direction. Give it 2 Me breaks down into a wonderful and catchy beat box chorus. Spanish Lesson starts off with soft Spanish guitar and a wonderfully catchy tune but veers into a hypnotic chorus where we're told to do our homework and get up on the dance floor. Voices, the last song on the album, starts off slowly, almost sensually and then veers into a sexy electronic funk that makes you sit up and take notice. Surprise after surprise makes this Madonna's most fantastic album yet.<br /><br />The dancing theme plays through out the album but the song that best describes what Hard Candy is all about is the track Dance 2night: Do it, do it/Let me turn you on/Let the music pull you through it/Till the break of dawn/Do it, do it/While the night is young/Let the music pull you through it/Till the lights go on.<br /><br />With those lyrics, and indeed the lyrics of all twelve songs on Hard Candy, you can't help but listen to Madonna's message: get up and dance. Hard Candy is hypnotic as Madonna pulls us through her music and helps us give into the beat.<br /><br />Hard Candy is Madonna at her best and most creative.

B00004RD54|2.0|This is a classic album, and the music is what everyone else has said it is. My gripe is with the remastering. I have the original LP of this, and I bought this CD mostly so I wouldn't wear out \\"Sweet Jane\\". Unfortunately, when they remastered this album, they changed the tonal balance, in a not so subtle way. They took all of the heft and body out of it, to the point where the guitars were almost tinny sounding. I was shocked, so much so, that I pulled the LP out and played it to see if my memory was faulty. It wasn't. I am deeply disappointed with this disc.
B000E6UWE4|5.0|I first pick this book up at the library and gave it a go.  After 60 pages, I was saying, \\"What?\\" \\"Who?\\"  I took it back, resolved not to read it again.  A year later I bought this book used and tried again.  All the characters and events begin to flesh out after page 200 (600+ pages), and from there you understand what's going on.  The story is epic!  There ain't much else to say.  There's so much going on and so many points of view I see why this series is compared to Song of Fire and Ice.  This book is detailed, you could take that as a \\"beware\\" or a \\"welcome\\".  I was determined to see what was so great about this book.  After learning of the major players and the supporting cast, then learning the history of the conflicts, I can say Erikson ranks up there with my top authors:  Martin, Gemmell, Jordan, and Keyes.
B00005JPKE|4.0|This film is worth seeing for its perspective. Normally, we are treated to nationalist, war-glorifying depictions of the Battle for Iwo Jima (and WWII in general), but LETTERS... explores the events from the Japanese perspective. Instead of caricaturing Japanese soldiers as uniformly blind in their obedience to the Emperor and military command, the characters in this film are individuals. Even those who seem to fit the kamikaze stereotype defy orders when the orders are not \\"patriotic\\" enough. But the protagonist of the story is one who, like many Americans, was forced into service against his will -- forced to abandon his wife and budding family to kill and die for the imperialist ambitions of his country. He wants nothing more than to survive this hell.<br /><br />LETTERS... is not a pro-war film. It depicts the horror and senselessness of war. However, there are some culturally imperialistic elements to the story. The sensible Japanese officers were schooled or spent time in America. The other officers (and many soldiers) think they are weak and, instead, want to engage in pointless kamikaze missions that will only weaken the Japanese cause. Maybe this is accurate. But if not, the implication is that the Japanese -- one of the most fearsome military forces in the history of the world -- did not know how to wage war. This is a minor quibble, though, and while I wouldn't consider LETTERS... a \\"must-see,\\" you will not feel as though your two hours have been wasted after viewing it.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|From the moment I first heard 4 minutes I knew it was going to be another hugh hit for Madonna. She is so clever when it comes to changing her style of music from album to album.  I was expecting the rest of the cd to be as hard and hip hop as the first release, but I was wrong. The first song on the cd is Candy Shop. I'll admit that when i first heard this song I hated it. After listening to the song a couple of times it has been constantly stuck in my head, which is a good sign for a great song. I am sure Candy Shop is going to be her 2nd single off the cd. Second track 4 minutes. My favorite song off the cd. Third Give It to Me is another catchy euro dance type of song that could possibly be released as well. Fourth is another favorite of mine Heartbeat. Destined to be a hit, a smooth hip hop summertime jam, I love it. Fifth Miles Away hummm...is this a song to Guy Ritchie I wonder. Another good song but more like a B Side. Sixth is She's not me...I loved this fast dance upbeat song but then halfway through it starts to get a little crazy and gets lost, good but i don't think it will be a single. Seventh Incredible is not so incredible. The weirdest song on the album. Eighth The Beat Goes on is another great great dance song. This must be released. It is catchy and danceable another favorite of mine. The next 2 song are just ok Dance 2 night and spanish lessons are the weaker songs on the album. Now Eleventh The Devil wouldn't recognize you is a fantastic song. It sounds as if it should have been on ray of light. It is a weird strange mellow masterpiece. This song will be a hit is she does release it. And last we have voices a slow song with not much commercial appeal but a nice way to end the cd. Overall I think Hard Candy will become a classic. A great old style cd with a new hip hop dance funk and of course Madonna the queen of the ALL. The songs she should release and in this order are 4 minutes, Candy Shop, Heartbeat, The Beat Goes on, The Devil Wouldn't Recongize You and Give it to me.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|\\"It reminds me of what a headache feels like... and why we get them,\\" is how a friend put it.    In past albums, Portishead has done an amazing job of pushing the envelope.  This album went too far though.    The music was all tension and no release.  It felt like it should be building to something, but never broke.    Portishead is one of those great bands that can get under your skin, make you a little bit uncomfortable, and then transport you someplace new.  This album only did the first two, but completely missed the all important third step.  It did not open up to anything.  It was like they were so pleased with their ability to create a creepy narcotic vibe, that they never bothered to consider what use they were going to put it to.    It might as well have been a 45 minute sound check.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|\\"menacing\\", \\"dark\\", \\"frightening\\" are all words you will see when reading reviews for the album. Third is not a quick thrills kind of record.  This is meant to be heard in long play format, and won't give you much instant gratification.  However, the long term rewards are well worth the investment.  Portishead have grown, and continue to shown their revelance for the listener that begs to be fed.    \\"silience\\"  the album begins with a formal sounding porugusee voice saying something to the affect of \\"you'll get what you deserve\\"..  you are then led to a wind up of various eletronic instruments until they all come together into a nice groove.  the melodic bass line complements the drum track perfectly.  at about 230 we are greeted with  the familar vocals of beth gibbons \\"...wounded and afraid.....going through changes\\".  then it fully comes together,  you realize that you are listening to the first new portishead music in 10 years.  the cello heard through out  really is the icing on the cake of this enjoyable opener.      \\"hunter\\"   to all those that think portishead would be a good choice to do a james bond theme song, this song adds more fuel to that fire.  pounding toms with tourchured guitar make a good back drop for beth to swoon.  \\"if i should fall would you hold me\\"?  need you ask beth?    \\"nylon smile\\"  this track has a middle eastern flair with a very simple effective groove.  you can picture  a picture beth snaking charming the pants off of lover.  this is a possible 3rd single on the album.  this songs seems to be about beth's curtain relationship.  \\"i dont know what i've dont to deserve you,  I don't know what'd I do without you\\".  Hopefully she has found someone worthy of her love.    \\"the rip\\"  very similar to beth's solo album. we are treated to a simple classical guitar that starts off this gorgeuos  slow burner.  What other song can you think of that feautures a bassoon during the climax?  The vocal effects  used on beth are truly appreciated whenlistened to at a high volume.  This song was mixed and mastered perfectly.    \\"Plastic\\"  Broken beats, and the first sign on the album of classic portishead.  This track could have fit in very well on their second album,  and may be the track that links the two together.  The classic stop, start method works again, and we know  begin to see how the old portishead and the new fit together.  This track is quite deep, filled with a lot of pink floyd snyth,  and depths of hell moans.    \\"We Carry On\\"  A highlight of the recent tour, this track shows that Portishead is still progressing.  \\"The taste of life I can't descibe\\"...envelopes  Silver Apples esque rhythms.  The raw guitars and fantastic drumming really work well here.  The music break down of the climax  rivals the high moments off OK Computer.  The changes of tempo and structure make this quite a thrill to soak in.    \\"Deep Water\\"  The first real shocker on the album comes equip with barbershop vocals courtsey of the someerfield workers choir, and ukulele.    \\"Machine Gun\\"  Now the album takes a sharp turn into much darker territory.  Here is where the meanacing comments come in to play.  Led by a brutal repetitive drum track, this song can only be appreciated  on a nice stereo system.  If you can last until the end you are treated with a climatic symth line that tops off the unforgiving   first single.  This song really must have been what Geoff was worried about on his blog, when he worried whether or not they   would \\"piss off the fondue society\\".  Beth's beautiful vocal and second shadow track really make this song listenable.  They really  wanted to challenge the listner here, and they succeeded.    \\"Small\\"  Probably a track that would fit on a cold rainy night by the fire place.  This is really a signal that we are in the gut on the album.  Slow guitars lead you through a emotional ride through beth's fragile mind.  This track has a middle section  that could have been on any doors album, and has enough musical goodies to entertain you through out.      \\"Magic Doors\\"  Whoever there there would be cowbell on a portishead record?  Just one of many surprizes on third.  The lyrics \\"I can't deny what I've become, I'm just emotionally undone\\" flow perfeclly with the smooth bass led opening.  Another left turn near the end with brief saxophone segway into beth's final few words.  This track is one of  the more accesible tracks on Third.    \\"Threads\\"  A lot of fans have singled this out as their favorite on various blogs and message boards.  As with \\"Plastic\\" we see a slight connection  to older Portishead with this one.  Another song that fits in with the songs on the second album, this track in a long closer that  really tops off the album quite well.  Beth gives a knockout bluesy vocal performance that leaves you begged for more, yet very  satisfied.
B000A158TC|4.0|I bought this UMD for a road trip so I did not really mind the lack of extras. I didn't get to see Ghost In the Shell until the second season so this was a great way to catch up. And if you are a long time fan I would definitely pick up the UMD or the DVD of this.  The sound isn't that great with movies on the PSP, especially if there is road noise. But the graphics come across just as well as I remember in the tv series. I love this genre because it's a little scary and it makes you think. I did notice the Major is a little less acclimated to her situation in this one. I missed her strong \\"I can handle anything\\" attitude.   Overall a great story and a great UMD to add to your collection.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This series has held up so well over the years. John Cleese is at his very best.
0380002930|5.0|This is a good book! Its really detailed, and it is interesting. I would reccomend it!
B00003CXCW|5.0|Fantastic movie.  I fall in love with it more and more each time I watch it.  The writing is well-done as is the acting.  Powerful..and William Holden--what a voice!  Def. worth the time invested to watch it--over and over.
B000YAA68C|4.0|I saw the previews for this movie and of course it looked like a tear jerker. I don't cry at movies tho. And my boyfriend was catching on to this pretty quick. I wanted to cry at this one, to show him I'm not some heartless robot (he assured me he never thought this, but the fear was still there.) We went, we saw, I cried. This was such a cute movie, I can't wait till it comes out next week. And I love love love the usage of Flogging Molly's song, If I Ever Leave This World Alive. I get misty eyed when I hear the song come on my mp3 player even now. Great movie if you're into tear jerkers, just plain sweet love stories, and Irish accents :-)
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I have to agree with the folks who complained about the fact that the ONLY version we got of this feature-length animation film is one in Japanese with subtitles... to Everything.  There is too much going on in this movie to have to pay attention to Reading for almost two hours!  Grrr.  And you have to read Fast!  Because the lines go by so fast that I sometimes had to hit the pause button just to make sure I could read what was on the screen before it moved on to the next line.  Imagine watching a whole movie via Pause-Play-Pause... A real drag.  And not very entertaining like the first GITS movie was.    I am Really Upset that I paid money for this that I can't get back because I opened the durned thing.    So my advise to those English-speaking consumers out there who are interested in getting this is to wait to see if a version comes out With English voice-overs.  Just like the First GITS movie.
B000001FHV|5.0|This was the first Puppets album I ever heard, and really is one of their best. I've spun a lot of their records, and I like some of the stuff that most Meat Puppet fans dig on. The first album is all kinds of weird, and the second album is great, and raw and punky. But for me, I like the style of this album the best. On par with the always wonderful UP On The Sun album, but this is the one that was there for me in my younger days, where I didn't discover Sun until many years later. Sometimes the songs on this one just catch you in a place where you can take the biggest heap of sh** you are dealing with, and just float away on it, as if it were a flying carpet. The songs here work like this on me even more now than they did back then...(I deal with a lot more sh** piles, I guess).<br />They really make you stop for a minute and just breathe everything in, and sometimes that makes the back of my head go buzz a little, and is a truly welcome sensation.<br />This album never really acheived much success, even though their names became pretty well known during 1994, the year this was released, ala, the tour with Nirvana. Maybe a certain tragedy took some of the light off of them, but at the time it seemed like they were ready to rebirth a new career. Lots of great harmonizing and some rockin guitars and/or nice mellow grooves.<br />I def say check it out!
B0014BDP88|4.0|This movie has a great cast. David Strathairn is superb as the Memphis cop with the runaway wife, and Rachel Weisz is also fantastic. Actually, I think Norah Jones is really good, in a piece of inspired casting and a natural performance. Her character is the touchstone of the movie. The part of the movie from her arrival in Memphis, the bar with Strathairn and Weisz and other characters...really riveting.    The rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to that part, though. Jude Law is pretty good, kind of playing himself, but those scenes are a little too cute. Natalie Portman shows her increasing versatility as an actress and there are some very warm and compelling scenes during that part, but it didn't quite come together.    The whole movie has an improvisational feel to it that is alternately very exciting and unpredictable, and then kind of missing and a little dumb. However, good cinematography and acting more or less carry it through. I'm a fan of Norah Jones' music but didn't expect her to be that great in this movie. I was surprised that she was actually pretty good. I think she should do another movie at some point, maybe with this director - not just any director. Music is good, too, particularly the Cassandra Wilson Harvest Moon performance.    All in all, worth seeing, in a sort of experimental way. Kind of reminded me at times of Paris, Texas.
0307387178|5.0|Great book. I didn't like that the author dips into his past about how he relates to Chris for a couple chapters. Other than that, I thought it was great and informative.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|This new album \\"Hard Candy\\" leaves me with a bitter taste in my mouth. I loved C.O.A.D.F. Just check my review if you don't believe me. I Will ALWAYS be a fan of Madonna, but I just don't think this album cuts it. It's a big fall from her previous Album Confessions On A Dance Floor, which was a masterpiece. THAT album was futuristic, modern and danceable, and pioneering, but now Madonna, once the leader, is now just doing what everyone else is doing, using hip producers to create an album of superficial gunk. The main offenders for me are \\"Shes Not Me\\" and \\"Incredible\\". They are way too repetitive and last for 6 minutes each. far too long and boring. Most of the lyrics sound like they were written by a 5 year old. \\"I'm comin to your party girl...\\" Would she ever have said something as ludacris as that on \\"Ray Of Light\\" I Think Not. \\"American Life\\" was better than this piece of garbage. ALL of the songs on \\"Hard Candy\\" sound like they were composed over pre-programed key board jingles. Kiss Goodbye the Innovative Madonna from L.A.P and R.O.L. Those Albums deserved critical praise. This \\"Hard Candy\\" however does NOT. On the cover of 2005's \\"Confessions\\" Madonna looked fabulous. healthy, Beautiful and Strong. The cover was a reflection of the great music that made up that Album. The same can be said for this Album. The music sounds just like the Cover looks. CHEAP.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I own 7 of Madonna's studio albums and I would rate this near the bottom of the 7.  I always saw Madonna as a leader in the \\"Pop World\\" for the last 25 years and expected much of the same with Hard Candy.  Instead, the album is less about Madonna and more about the producers she chose to work with.  Where is Madonna on this album?  Without even reading the liner notes, I can tell which producer did what song by the style that's unique to them.  I kept waiting for Madonna's influence to show but that never happened.  This album will do nothing but boost all the producers' profiles at the expense of Madonna's.    Most tracks (except for 2) are too long to begin with. A pop song should never be more than 4 minutes (in time, not the track).  Many could have been cut down by a minute, to save me from hitting the FF button after 3 1/2 minutes.  Perhaps, she did this on purpose so that fans will run out and buy digital radio edits of Candy Shop, Miles Away and Give it 2 Me, when they get their single release.  $he'$ a $mart bu$ine$$ woman, that'$ for $ure.  I just wish I had an album with radio edits.  Leave the extended 5+ minute songs to the remix album.     After just a few listens, I'm already tired of chewing on it.  Where can I spit it out?
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|\\"Cloverfield\\" is something of a novelty film: it doesn't really have much to add to the horror genre, but should definitely be watched nonetheless.  According to the \\"making-of\\" documentary, the filmmakers were wanting to create an \\"American Godzilla.\\"  Well, they didn't.  But what they DID do is create a film that is certainly a worthwhile watch, that does have something to say, even if it doesn't quite reach the expectations the filmmakers set out for.<br /><br />The movie starts out at a goodbye party.  A young man (names are inconsequential, we'll get to that in a moment) is heading to Japan (they didn't make their homages very subtle, did they?).  A friend-who-is-more-than-a-friend shows up at his party (with another guy), then promptly leaves.  While our main character is mourning, something happens.  The earth shakes.  They race to the top of their building.  There's an explosion.  They race down to the street.  The head of the Statue of Liberty rolls by.  They race to the Brooklyn Bridge.  They race...<br /><br />They race around.  Except for an interesting sequence where they're stuck on a subway platform.  But basically, they're racing.  Which is good--because, if these characters stuck around anywhere for long, we wouldn't give a rat's petoot what happened to them.  The acting wasn't all that bad, really--it's just, the characters weren't likeable.  The movie started out like a soap opera, but that is a bit of a necessity--it MUST start out mundane, for us to realize the significance of what is going on.  If only the characters were interesting...<br /><br />Nevermind.  The star here is the monster.  And the cinematography.  I've seen complaints that the camera work is too jerky; well, no kidding.  In order to capture what this event would really be like (don't want monsters, okay, substitute a terrorist attack), we must see it through the eyes of the characters involved.  Or, rather, the eyes of ONE character involved--in this case, Hud, a funnyman who is charged with filming the evening's events (then decides to document everything else when the proverbial you-know-what hits the proverbial fan).  This is where \\"Cloverfield\\" earns its worth--it a horror story told uniquely ONLY from the point of view of the victims...and not even that, but a small group of victims, arguably ONE victim.  It is a movie about a global event told through the eyes of a single character.  If for that reason alone, \\"Cloverfield\\" will get your mind and blood racing.  Just like its characters.he evening's events (then decides to document everything else when the proverbial you-know-what hits the proverbial fan).  This is where \\"Cloverfield\\" earns its worth--it a horror story told uniquely ONLY from the point of view of the victims...and not even that, but a small group of victims, arguably ONE victim.

B000002G26|5.0|All the songs of this CD are so good that you can listen to them over and over again without getting bored. It has all the variety you want in an album - rock, romance , great lyrics etc. I think this is one of the best Bryan adams CD ever. I bought it 8 years back and someone borrowed it and never gave back and I love it so much that I bought it again !
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|Can´t believe we waited so long just to get this album... 4 Minutes is her weakest song ever, does not have a feeling, she doesn´t get the best lines. And Justin can´t even sing.  Hard Candy is a nice album, don´t get me wrong, Is in fact exactly as a CANDY, YOU TRY IT ONE OR TWO TIMES AND THEN YOU THROW IT OUT. MADONNAS EVOLUTION IN THIS WORK IS NONE.  FINAL LINE: HARD CANDY MUST BE CALLED: TIMBALAND FEATURING MADONNA.
B000RIHBIE|3.0|You will most likely agree with this review if:<br /><br />a) You consider All Killer No Filler to be their best album (even though I don't)<br />b) You hate bands like Fall Out Boy and Dragonforce<br />c) You think Chuck is their worst album<br />d) you hate almost every mainstream band out there<br /><br />Sure the cover of the album is bowling-shoe ugly, but die hard fans of S41 will undoubtably LOVE this album. Unless you've been living under a rock for the last bit of time, you'd realize that they lost a member.<br /><br />UCH is the fifth Sum 41 studio album. As I was expecting it to be better than Chuck, it was, but that's not saying much. This album was pretty interesting, but nothing to get hyped up over. The verdict on the songs:<br /><br />UNDERCLASS HERO: 10/10: A song that really sounds like their AKNF stuff. Good work guys.<br /><br />WALKING DISASTER: 8/10: Good, catchy song.<br /><br />SPEAK OF THE DEVIL: 5/10: Killer musicianship, filler lyrics.<br /><br />DEAF FATHER (COMPLETE UNKNOWN): 4/10: A whiny song by Deryck about his dad...<br /><br />COUNT YOUR LAST BLESSINGS: 2/10: The chorus is 90% of the reason why people call Sum 41 \\"emo\\" nowadays. Really, just some lame and depressing song about some kid not having friends.<br /><br />MA POUBELLE: 0/10: Deryck attempts to sing in French in this song... what else needs to be said.<br /><br />MARCH OF THE DOGS: 8/10: Despite being an Anti-Flag and Green Day ripoff, still is a great song.<br /><br />THE JESTER: 10/10: The best song on the album, and the only song that manages to score a 10/10.<br /><br />WITH ME: 7/10: Good song, great lyrics.<br /><br />PULL THE CURTAIN: 6/10: Gah. They're doing something wierd with this one. Good first half, the second half comes around and rapes what could have been an otherwise decent song.<br /><br />KING OF CONTRADICTION: 8/10: Good song, just as I was falling asleep this woke me up. Nice, catchy tune.<br /><br />BEST OF ME: 1/10: Now I'm really starting to get annoyed here. This is ANOTHER ballad. Perhaps emo kids or your depressed girlfriend would like this. I've tried liking this song so much, I just can't. It makes me cry thinking about it...<br /><br />CONFUSION AND FRUSTRATION IN MODERN TIMES: 5/10: I really agree with \\"A Reviewer\\". This could have been left off the album, and really should have been left off the album.<br /><br />SO LONG GOODBYE: 0/10: *snooze*...<br /><br />LOOK AT ME (HIDDEN TRACK): 0/10: An extra slow song about nothing. NOTHING!!!!!!!! Had a hard time keeping awake while listening to this song, I just couldn't wait for it to be over. Not interested. NEXT!!!!!<br /><br />I saw them on the Strength in Numbers 2007 tour (0ct. 15th at the Shaw Confrence Centre in Edmonton, AB, Canada), and there are a lot of weak songs that sounded AMAZING live. As usual, S41 always deliver the goods live. I still have my T-shirt from the concert, and still wear it with pride. But amazing live sound aside, this is an overall decent-at-best CD. Yes, it's worth buying, just be prepared to skip a lot of tracks.ch, I just can't. It makes me cry thinking about it...

1573226521|4.0|The Beach is an easy book to read that should leave any traveller nodding their head in recognition, dismay, or both.  While it doesn't explore the complexities of the modern, post-colonial relationship between \\"east\\" and \\"west\\" to a great extent, it does explore that relationship just enough to keep the book interesting.  It's not really a thriller; it's written in the fast-paced, easy-flowing style of a thriller and it contains a lot of violence, but the narrator's perspective is too focused on the mundane aspects of things for the book to really be called \\"thrilling.\\"  Richard, the protagonist is not really that \\"shallow,\\" \\"immoral,\\" or a \\"slacker,\\" as people have commented. But he is simple. He's a lonely person who travels and does drugs - two very primitive sources of stimulation, really - because more grounded, consistent ways of life don't seem to work for him. He's not a rebel nor does he have much angst. Like many travellers, he hides from himself by putting himself in unfamiliar surroundings.   Many travellers may complain about the protagonist's \\"narrow\\" view of the world, but they are missing the point. Richard reveals a truth about travel that many readers may be afraid to face: no matter how much we talk about \\"experiencing another culture,\\" and \\"getting to understand the world,\\" most of travel really consists of hanging out with people like ourselves, and what we ultimately like about travel, more than any kind of deep learning, is excitement and fun.   But, yes, Richard's level of consciousness is ultimately quite shallow (Perhaps Garland's is as well?), and sometimes I, too, found myself disappointed by that fact: sometimes, I wished that the book would offer more insights into the problematic relationship between backpackers and their destinations and the ultimate silliness of the Western desire to find \\"unspoiled,\\" \\"natural\\" places, and I wished for more interesting sentences (I appreciate the simplicity and straight-forwardness of the narration,but there are many simple writers who still manage to create great sentences, and Garland is not one of them, nor do I think he wants to be.)  But I was grateful for the absence of something else from the book: pretentiousness. In recent years, and even moreso in the 1990s, \\"depth\\" consisted of vague pop culture references and poetic, ironic, self-congratulatory writing.  Garland's voice, on the other hand, is so modest as to be almost boring, and his pop culture references are done without any irony: he talks about video games merely because they are a big part of his life. He doesn't attempt to comment on the nature of pop culture, he just talks about it a lot. He doesn't say that pop culture has \\"shaped\\" our \\"postmodern\\" culture, or \\"replaced\\" anything \\"real\\"; really, video games are just one of the many things that influence his life.  The Beach, for its lack of pretentiousness in dealing with potentially \\"big\\" subjects (the relationship of east and west, pop culture, alienation), would almost merit five stars.   It is refreshing that The Beach doesn't seem to be trying to \\"add up to much,\\" but it is nonetheless frustrating that it doesn't add up to much. When the narrator references Vietnam movies and draws superficial parallels between The Beach and the Vietnam war, the result is just that: superficial. Garland did not develop this motif enough for it to be interesting, nor did he keep it minimal enough for it to not get annoying.  The constant barrage of phrases along the lines of \\"This is Vietnam, boy!\\" are neither as silly nor as scary as they should be.  At times, it appears that The Beach will become either an action-packed adventure story or a profoundly developed reflection on the world, but it does not really deliver on either of those levels unless you ignore certain aspects of it or put too much energy into reading between the lines.   In the end, however, The Beach is a satisfying, commendable novel. It is an easy-to-read piece of pseudo-travel litthat, if it does not define a generation, certainly does, to a small extent, define a certain type of traveller that existed in that generation.
B0018CAAN6|5.0|Madonna knows how to keep it real with todays music scene. Her ability to master the art of music is amazing! The way in which she fills each song with layer after layer of sounds and beats. It was a very smart move for her to start working with Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, and Kanye West since it shows she can still hang with todays music. GREAT ALBUM!
0812565886|5.0|Persuasion is a small novel, but it is Jane Austen at her best.  Her commentary on the English gentry and the restrictions of \\"society\\" are well presented in this story of Anne who was once persuaded not to marry a man with no prospects and no station in life, at least compared to hers as the daughter of a baronet.  Jane Austen proves there can be passion without being graphic.  A great lvoe story!
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I first became a Madonna fan back in 1982 with her hit \\"Everybody\\", an from that time I watched her rise to stardom. Nothing but hits flying in such as \\"Like A Virgin,Holiday,La Isla Bonita,Like A Prayer,Vogue,Frozen,and so many more.I purchased all the albums and loved how she just kept getting better and better. That all stopped when she released the 2000 album \\"Music\\". I found myself only liking one song of the album, titled \\"Don't Tell Me\\". Since that time, nothing she has released as been a liking to my ears. I tried so hard to listen to \\"Music\\",\\"American Life\\",& \\"Confession On A Dance Floor\\". I just could not get myself to like them. In late 2007, I heard she was releasing a new album, I still get worked up when she about to release it. Like always, I rushed out to the music store the day of release and purchased the album. I am really disappointed in this album, there is nothing really to offer here. It sounds like alot like Britney Spears throwaway songs. The only decent track here is \\"Give It 2 Me\\", but it's not a jaw dropping song. I am sure the album will sell well, just as everything else she releases.The first single \\"4 minutes\\",is not all that great, it sounds like it came from Justin Timberlake's album. The album does have an r&b taste to it, but Madonna did that awhile back in 1994 with \\"Bedtime Stories\\", which Babyface produced and that album came out fantastic. Still to this day my favorite Madonna album remains \\"True Blue\\", not following far behind is \\"Like A Prayer\\",\\"Ray Of Light\\",\\"Immaculate Collection\\",\\"Erotica\\",and \\"Bedtime Stories\\". Hopefully she will get back to her roots one day. I would really like to see Madonna do another album \\"Ray Of Light\\" but I still love her and hope she can get back to great music again soon. Her last decent track in my opinion is 2000's \\"Don't Tell Me\\". I wish Madonna would team up again with \\"Stephen Bray\\", he wrote alot of great songs for Madonna. I'd still recommend this to any Madonna fan!
1400079276|3.0|My eagerness to enjoy Kafka on the shore on my 5 hours plane was quickly poured with cold water. the books starts out too slow, with a pace that makes me feel like after turning a few pages, all the words I've read don't mean a thing. I'm not sure if that's my mind state that changed since the last time I read The Chronicle of the Wind-up Bird (which I loved so muchhhhhhhhhh) or his pace is not the same, but I'm sure it was a bit annoying to not see anything progress after a while, so I decided to put it aside and listen to music. The book was not fascinating enough.    Yet later, whenever I'm bored and got nothing to do, I try to finish his book part by part, it took like nearly a month, but I managed to finish it.     And the book was ok. Something about a stupid song, about a librarian whose ghost of her younger years made love with the main character, and there's this guy talking to cats and stuffs. Strange things like usual. The style is pretty much the same, yet I just don't connect with this story at all. It doesn't pull me, suck me into its world like other books   I read before, like Norwegian wood or Bird Chronicle.    Moral of the story is, don't waste your time on this book.     I still look out for other Murakami new publishings, though.
B00005JNJV|5.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" is Christopher Nolan's version of how Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) became Batman. It explains how his parents were killed, his fear of bats, and some of the extremities he went through with some of his training; along with every other personal and physical obstacle Bruce must face on the way to finally becoming The Dark Knight. Gotham City is dying since guys like Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) are able to get away with just about anything because \\"he keeps the bad people rich and the good people scared,\\" as Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) would put it.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne trains with Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), the right hand of Ra's Al Ghul, and The League of Shadows before things turn ugly. The League of Shadows believes in justice, but doesn't think people who have committed such crimes deserve to live while Bruce Wayne believes in compassion and thinks criminals should have a fair trial before passing judgement. Leaving The League of Shadows in shambles, Bruce Wayne makes his way back to Gotham after a seven year absence. As Bruce Wayne said, \\"As a man, I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, I can be destroyed. But as a symbol...as a symbol I can be incorruptible. I can be everlasting.\\" This is the story of Batman's uprising and the criminals he encounters along the way.<br /><br />This is the beginning of the best version of Batman to hit the silver screen, boys and girls. Tim Burton's original film is really the only competition, but \\"Batman Begins\\" surpasses Burton's \\"Batman\\" in almost every way. This film has a lot of strengths that start with the storyline. It doesn't stray too far away from Batman classics like \\"Year One\\" and is just as dark in tone. The screenplay is also incredibly well-written as the dialogue feels natural and everything takes place in realistic fashion. The acting is very impressive as the main cast is filled with excellent actors; Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Rutger Hauer, and Ken Watanabe. This cast is beyond ridiculous if you stop to think about it.<br /><br />With films like \\"28 Days Later\\", \\"Sunshine,\\" and the Christopher Nolan directed \\"Inception\\" under his belt, Cillian Murphy should be on your radar of actors you should always keep your ear to the ground for. He makes the most of his screen time as nearly every one of his scenes is memorable in some way or another. Liam Neeson isn't so much under-utilized anymore as much as he's underappreciated. The Henri Ducard character is a fascinating one whose enigmatic personality unravels more and more as the film progresses. Gary Oldman, who is perhaps one of the greatest actors to never win an Oscar, is just as fantastic as ever. How rare is it that the supporting cast is just as strong as the lead actors in any film? That's something Christopher Nolan is always able to accomplish.<br /><br />The impressive cinematography is also something to take note of. The film mostly takes full advantage of the darkness as Batman is always utilizing the shadows to fight crime, but it only makes the sudden shifts to color that much more sharp and vibrant. The camera being in Batman's face as he tells Flass (Mark Boone Junior) to, \\"Swear to me!\\" in the rain is so memorable thanks to how it's filmed as is every time Jonathan Crane puts on his mask and uses his fear toxin.<br /><br />If there is one Batman film anyone should see, this is it. It's a superhero film with a dark tone that's very well-written with nothing but incredible actors involved. In a world where most movies these days are usually either remakes or films that are made as quickly as possible to cash in on the latest trend in Hollywood, a reboot that is not only worthy of your time but tends to make you forget about every other version that came before it says quite a bit. If there was one film that could change someone's mind about disliking the Batman character, then this would be it. This is a good enough film to stand on its own regardless of how the viewer feels about Batman going into it.and on its own regardless of how the viewer feels about Batman going into it.
0670018651|4.0|Tania Sanchez and Luca Turin have written a wonderful book.  The reviews themselves are great fun to read and use as a reference, but the articles/essays preceding each section are also quite good, unusual in a book of this type.  I almost wish there was more of the essay-type material.  Hopefully they will be able to do an updated version sometime in the near future, or another book on fragrance entirely.  Both are great writers with distinct prose styles, and it's fun to have them together in a way that doesn't try to meld them into one.  Highly recommended.
0446402389|5.0|Some books you read.... others change the way you see the world. Never has one book so completely captured every nuisance of a culture during a specific era in history as \\"Child 44.\\" Tom Rob Smith's debut novel takes us to Russia in 1953. To a people controlled by fear. To a society where no one is exempt from the retaliation of the government; from the starving, desperate peasants to the well-supplied elite. To a place where your life hangs in the balance every minute of every day. Everything you think, say or do must be guarded to ensure your loyalty to the Party... and sometimes even all the taken precautions cannot save you. In the mist of this we meet Leo Demidov, who begins to doubt the veracity of the system that he has been a part of all his life when the crimes of what is obviously a serial killer are attributed to the most convenient person that can be apprehended. Through a series of events Demidov , a MGB hunter, becomes the hunted as he flees to be free long enough to prove that these crimes are being committed by one man that has not yet been captured. Each character in the astonishing novel is so fully developed socially, physical and psychologically that they are as alive to us as our own family and friends. Reading like a non-fiction account of Stalin's Russia, a complex and captivating mystery/thriller and a dark and engaging true crime story that defies current book definitions, Tom Rob Smith may have very well started a new and exciting genre of book. If you only have time to read one book this year, do yourself a favor and make it \\"Child 44.\\"
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I am the biggest Madonna fan! I could not wait for this album to be released! I love the dance beats, and fun lyrics. Madonna is the ultimate queen of pop! She is without a doubt absolutely fabulous and still has it after all these years! I love every track except Spanish Lesson. Its the only track that is ok. Otherwise every other track is amazing! People should stop saying she is so old and give it up! What do they know?! She is only 49 and still has got it! So if you love Madonna or love great dance music, buy this album! You won't be disappointed! Keep them coming Madonna! We absolutely love you!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I really enjoy the old Stargate with Ricky Dean as Jack O'Neill (with 2 Ls) but this movie was very exciting.  Though some parts jumped from one scene to another with no explanation but it explains a lot of unanswered questions one had from the show. Especially why the ancients do not intervene, the truth about Merlin not ascending, but that it is Morgan LaFay whose been helping SG-1.  I am pleased that I finally got to hear how Teal'c battles in trying to do good after doing so much bad and how he feels.  The death of a Prior is also very intense. I have watched this movie like 50 times and still enjoy it.  I can't wait for the next movie. Thanks.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Okay, all the previous 5-star reviews have already voiced my opinion of \\"Hard Candy\\", so I won't belabor my critique with similar descriptions and praise.<br /><br />I will say that this new Madonna project is a total surprise to me, mostly because I felt reasonably sure I wouldn't like it. But \\"Hard Candy\\" has turned out by far to be Madge's most consistantly excellent, musically imaginative CD since \\"Ray of Light\\", although stylistically, it is universes apart from that work.<br /><br />Those who've criticized \\"Hard Candy\\" for being too different, too much of a departure, and a sell-out, must have come on-board really late in in the game as Madonna fans, because all the songs echo the ear-delicious dance pop of her early career, only re-invented in a modern hip-hop frame.  I have two copies of \\"H.C\\": one for the car, one for home, and neither has stopped playing since I bought them.  This music is giddy, edgy, ecstactically ingenious, and yes, uplifting.  \\"Hard Candy\\" is gonna be H-U-G-E, and I guarantee it will forever be remembered as the soundtrack for the summer of 2008.<br /><br />The artwork and photography are also a hoot, with Madge making fun of her younger, sex-queen-dominatrix persona.  Oddly, everything about \\"Hard Candy\\" gives me the feeling that at age 49, Madonna is finally saying goodbye to that dance-tramp image with one last, big, sweet kiss.  I'm willing to bet we'll be witnessing a totally new re-invention of the artist at age 50.  But boy, thanks for a great ride Ms. Ciccone. And long may the songs keep coming . . .
0634014331|5.0|There are a few good Hammond books out there but this one is the most complete. Drawbar settings, percussion and chorus/vibrato settings, swell pedal and leslie instruction, very thorough. Not only does it take you through a gradual learning process to get the instrument down, you gain some cool licks and stylistic direction along the way.
1567315682|4.0|Financial books providing insight into the attitudes and mannerisms required to accumulate wealth generally focus on a lot of theory.  The Millionaire Next Door presents a straight forward account based on research and feedback from qualified millionaires.<br /><br />The information presented in this book focuses on the habits that create millionaires from ordinary people who often have ordinary incomes. The authors show that to be wealthy, you do not necessarily require extraordinary skills or require ardent pep talks; you just need financial discipline and a willingness to live within your means and avoid certain amounts of debt.<br /><br />The information in the book is substantiated with a number of graphs, charts, and summations of data that will limit one's ability to push through the information quickly.  The content of the book is very reliable and will be eye opening for many readers.  There is no doubt this book presents a very formidable foundation for wealth that anyone with grand financial aspirations should be aware of, making this book rather worthwhile
0321200683|5.0|I am an occasional buyer of reference works on software technologies I need to get familiar with, and I teach an evening section at a local area college in object oriented analysis and design.  After reading this book, I am actively trying to construct a proposal for a new course based on its contents ... it's that good.      Quite simply, Enterprise Integration Patterns blew me away, on both a technical and pedagogical level.  On the technical level, it's all here (except for \\"aspect\\" patterns like security, robustness and scalability which would each have really required another book).  All the patterns necessary to successfully support asynchronous messaging between groups of remote applications ... which is the basic situation facing anyone trying to do a mashup of web services and / or construct business processes by integrating internal services via an ESB.  Even the Process Manager pattern is here.      On a pedagogical level, the material is complete, very easy to read, well illustrated, and above all, well organized.  Even a first look at the inside covers reveals this.  The front has each of the 60+ patterns listed alphabetically, with its respective icon and 2 sentence paragraph.  The back has the patterns (name and icon) clumped into 6 hierarchical \\"pattern buckets\\" (Message Endpoints, Message Construction, Message Channels, Message Routing, Message Transformation, and System Management), linked together in a single diagram, showing where the buckets fit when Application A is connected to Application B.      And on both inside covers as well as every place in the text where a pattern is mentioned (quite a bit since patterns are extensively contrasted with each other), the page number where it is defined is given with its name.  This makes it very easy to use this book as a reference, because all the patterns it contains are cross-referenced in so many ways.      After an excellent introduction the first chapter explains what a pattern is, what the domain of integration patterns are, and introduces the Widget Manufacturing Company, whose problem grows as tools to handle those problems are introduced.      Bottom line ... I read this book during the two legs of a round trip flight from Chicago to San Francisco, took copious notes within the pages of the book, and walked off the 2nd plane feeling that I had seriously increased my understanding of the entire topic of how to integrate loosely coupled applications.      Not bad ... plus since I snagged an upgrade on the return flight, I can also report that two glasses of wine did not interfere in the slightest with the learning experience.  The book is THAT good.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna's 11th studio album rocks!  Once again, I'm not disappointed by her funk and r&b tracks.  Her collaborations with Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Pharell and Kanye West are a smashing success!  My faves are \\"Candy Shop,\\" \\"Heartbeat,\\" \\"Give it 2 Me\\" and \\"Beat Goes On.\\"  Madonna's longevity is a testiment to her talent and ability to create danceable and catchy tunes.  In 2003, the New York Times said she was no longer relevant.  Well, they were proven wrong!  Her single \\"4 Minutes\\" already sold 1 million digital copies.  I'm sure this album will be #1.  Keep rockin', Madonna!
B0014KD46W|5.0|I have never heard Steve Winwood like this. \\"Nine Lives\\" is an excellent album features nine new tracks from Steve.  He sounds great with his band.  My favorite track is \\"Fly\\". This track is purely instrumental for the first minute and a half  and turns into a vocal.  This song is so peaceful.  Paul Booth is so good on the saxophone and flute here. \\"Dirty City\\" is a great rock song.  Eric Clapton sounds so good playing the guitar here.  \\"Raging Sea\\" is a groovy sounding track.  I like Jose Neto's bass guitar playing here. \\"I'm Not Drowning\\" features Steve on the acoustic guitar.  He sounds very bluesy here. \\"At Times We Do Forget\\" and \\"Other Shore\\" are two songs that feature everyone in Steve's band.  Richard Bailey provides an excellent beat on the drums.  \\"Other Shore\\" is such a relaxing track.  Karl Vanden Bossche is a talented percussionist bongo player on the track \\"Hungry Man\\".  I love this new album from Steve Winwood.
B000003MZU|5.0|Aquí se aprecia la melodía y la poesía de Juan Luis. Este fue el primer disco que escuché de él. En el hay canciones que llegan a lo profundo del ser. Deben ser pocas las canciones más bellas para estar enamorado que \\"Bachata Rosa\\" o \\"Estrellitas y Duendes\\". Grande Juan Luis!!!!
B000YENUI6|3.0|When I saw the previews for this film, I expected a movie like the \\"Godfather\\" with the Russian mafia instead of the Italian.  For the most part, that is exactly what it was.  I loved the Godfather, but too many flaws in this film prevented me from enjoying it nearly as much.<br /><br />First, the good points.  Viggo Mortensen was superb in the role of Nikolai.  His accent sounded good, and he fit the part well.  His reserved demeanor and soft-spoken dialog lull a viewer until he erupts into surprising violence. The oft-mentioned sauna scene where he fights naked is both shocking and realistic.  It was graphic violence that I could not look away from, and fully illustrated the dangerous world he was living in.  In fact, there is very little violence but when it does pop up, it is almost always shocking because the rest of the film was so slow.  This is not an in your face gangster movie; at times it was plodding.  The producers did an excellent job of developing and maintaining the mystery of Nikolai.  What are his motivations?  Who is he?  When it was finally revealed, it was a nice twist.  Plus, I loved the parts about the tattoos and their meaning.  It really added something to the film.  Finally, the setting and lighting were fabulous.  The movie was visually, as well as thematically, gritty.  I felt like I was in London, in a Russian neighborhood.<br /><br />However, the movie had many problems.  First, I agree with some reviewers that Naomi Watt's character was too one-dimensional and unbelievably stupid.  What ordinary person upon hearing what's in that diary rushes out to verbally attack a mobster!?  Come on!  Especially in light of her father fleeing Russia and possibly the KGB.  The second problem, and by far the more serious, was the dialog in Russian.  I would hazard a guess that at least 35% of the dialog in in Russia - with no subtitles.  I watched this On Demand with my family, and we wondered if it was supposed to have subtitles after all?  If not, what a bad choice.  A few lines here and there to build authenticity and remind viewers of the subject would have been fine.  But, entire conversations where I had no clue what they were saying and no body language to convey the meaning either?  This was one problem that I could not overcome.  Some of my family found the movie boring, and I think this is a direct cause.  How interesting can it be to watch people talk in a language you don't speak?  And the ending.  I couldn't agree more with all the viewers that hated it.  It was not only unrealistic, it left viewers wondering, \\"That's it!? Wait, what happened to...?\\"  I felt like I was at the end of \\"Kill Bill V1\\" only no VII is forthcoming.<br /><br />Overall, this movie could have been fantastic despite the slow pace.  Instead, it was disappointing.  It was worth seeing for Viggo (and that unbelievable bath house scene), but rent it, don't buy..

B000P2A24W|2.0|Personally I don't like Bon Jovis's evolution. I know times have changed, but one thing I know is that music does not have a time, I listen to Bach, music that was written more than 300 years ago and it moves you and touches your soul. I listen to any of this album's songs, and they don't even come close to a song like \\"You give love a bad name\\" or \\"Bad Medicine\\", and I am not even going to compare them to \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\". What happened to their music?, this CD is just average, not even a shadow of the music they composed in their early years. I guess inspiration has gone. If you are new to Bon Jovi I suggest you buy the best of them, when they still had the magic: \\"Slippery when wet\\" and \\"New Jersey\\" have the energy lacking in their latest albums. Just try and compare any song, you will see what I mean. If anyone disagrees with me, your opinion is welcome, I just need to know what happened to them, could you explain it to me?? Because I don't get it.  Anyway, this album has two songs I think they are OK:  - whole lot of leaving  - Stranger
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|The album is more than worth the wait. It's incredible how this band has matured over the past decade. Portishead's \\"Third\\" achieves what few albums in the past few years have accomplished... we'll still be listening to it and it will still sound fresh and exciting in the year 2018.
B0012HEB32|5.0|Firstly, I'd like to preface this with a caveat that I'm a huge fan of the first two Terminator movies and their supplementary materials (books, games, etc). T3, however, is definitely not on my list of favorite movies.    This show wouldn't have been as successful as it's been if it had had a different cast or a different producer. The fact that the show launched smack in the middle of a Writer's Guild Strike and still manage to perform well in both time slot viewings and DVR's says alot about the quality of the show.      The story lines are very well thought out, confronting issues of not only human relationships, but the relationships of humans and machines. I think putting forth the idea that SKYNET ultimately evolved from a simple chess computer (\\"The Turk\\") is a great way of grounding not only the series but the franchise in simple reality, as well as generating a simple \\"this could happen anywhere\\" aura around the show. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and I'll never look at my Dell the same way again. I'm also very glad they've avoided the \\"Terminator of the Week\\" series model, and instead of focusing on running away from SKYNET, they are making an attempt to face it. An attempt that we know will be ultimately futile, but it will be interesting to see how much of what happens in the series lays the groundwork for John Connor's eventual war against SKYNET.       I'd also like to give props to the actors, who have really taken their characters and run with them. I am a huge Firefly/Serenity fan, so Summer Glau was very familiar to me, as was Brian Austin Green. However, Thomas Dekker, Lena Headey, Dean Winters, and Richard T. Jones were all unknown quantities to me. Summer is as great as she's ever been, and has really gone from bit parts to a truly up and coming actress. Brian Austin Green has (thankfully) left his 90210 baggage behind and can now not only act, but do so really, really well.  Thomas Dekker is simply fantastic, and I think thebest John Connor so far.     There has been some debate about who plays a better Sarah Connor, Linda Hamilton or Lena Headey? I think it's kind of a loaded question because both women play Sarah Connor at drastically different points in their lives. Linda Hamilton played Sarah Connor when Sarah's only concern was protecting John from attack. Lena Headey is portraying Sarah in a time when protecting him is still a concern, but training him for his eventual destiny is of even greater importance.      Another point worth mentioning is that after viewing the series, I finally broke down and rented 300. I'm a huge history buff, especially of ancient greece, so hyper inflated \\"artistic\\" portrayals of actual events don't really appeal to me. However, Lena as Queen Gorgo really impressed to me throughout the movie, and I see alot of Gorgo in Lena's portrayal of Sarah. I'm not accusing Lena of being a one trick pony (which she isn't), but I believe that her portrayal of a strong female archetype in a blockbuster movie was perfect training for her to assume the role of Sarah Connor.    Richard T. Jones as FBI agent Ellison and Dean winters as Sarah's ex-Fiance Charlie are fantastic additions to the franchise. Most of the humans in the franchise are intimately intwined with the events the series portrays. Ellison and Charlie both enter as relative outsiders and their gradual understanding of what is really going on in the world of the series is a great new perspective on the events of the show. Charlie and Cameron also have probably one of the most memorable exchanges between two characters in season 1 (during episode 6, \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\")    As mentioned before, TSCC produced and aired in the middle of a WGA strike. With a season shortened to only 9 episodes, the fact that this series has generated as much fandom and hype as it has is a testament to how great it is. News just broke that the series has been renewed for Season 2, for 13 episodes with the possibility of extension to the full 22.      Also, the DVD box set should be coming out in the middle of august, according to the producers. FOX will be releasing the box set and airing reruns on monday nights starting in august, as a run up to the premier of season two.    Apparently, the suits at Fox have learned from their Firefly Folly and are finally giving a hit sci-fi series the marketing and timeslot it deserves.
1593974744|5.0|This was the best audio book I ever herd.  The voice work was top notch.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I love this album, I've always been  a fan of The Neptunes and Timbaland's production and Justin Timberlake is good also, I like him as a solo artist and in groups. This album is just great my favs are: Heartbeat, Candy Shop, Miles Away, She's Not Me, Devil Wouldn't, Beat Goes On( The demo and the album versions) and Incredible.
B00104QSOM|3.0|MOVIE : 5 stars / Packaging: 0 stars    You'll either love or hate this film. I will not go into reviewing this since everyone and their grandma has done the job. All I will say is that it was my favorite flick of 2007. The film is dark, atmospheric, and the soundtrack, in my book, is as much an essential character as Daniel Day Lewis.    If you love this movie, do yourself a favor, wait for the Blue Ray.  Don't waste your money on either of these discs. It will get scratched! All the complaints are 100% true. If you came up with a solution to prevent this, kudos to you...but I shouldn't be coming up with MacGyver solutions so a disk does not get scratched in its own packaging.    I pray to allah the blue ray will have normal packaging...either way, it takes much more to scratch a blue ray...so it is a win-win solution.     If you don't have a blue ray, do yourself another favor, use your tax rebate and buy a PS3.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|Madonna's Hard Candy is a mixed bag. Whatever Madonna does, she makes it her own. This album is no different. Here's my 2 cents:    Candy Shop: Light hearted. Just OK.  2 1/2 Stars  4 Minutes: Highly infectious. Great for radio. Not her best first single.                 3 Stars  Give It 2 Me: This song alone is worth the price of admission. 5 Stars  Heartbeat: Filler. 2 Stars  Miles Away: Heartfelt. Great lyrics. 4 Stars  She's Not Me: Easily belongs with COADF. 5 Stars  Incredible: Filler. 1 Star  Beat Goes On. Fun but I don't like the rap. 4 Stars  Dance 2Night: Just OK. 2 Stars  Spanish Lesson: Something about this song I like. It's odd. 3 Stars  Devil Wouldn't Recognize You: Yes it sounds like a JT song but works great for Madonna. Madonna vocally delivers. 5 Stars  Voices: Great closing song. 5 Stars   Average: 3.45 Stars    When Hard Candy works, its fantastic. When it doesn't it falls flat. This is the first Madonna album since the 1980s that has fillers. I have always felt that once the 90's came, Madonna became a album's artist. With this albums she, only temporarily I hope, is a singles artist.     It's still worth the purchase for Madonna fans.
0143038419|1.0|My heart goes out to those who say this is the best book they've ever read.  Man, they are reading some bad, bad books!  I just can't recommend this one.  I found it too self-indulgent from an author too self-absorbed.  I slogged through to the end because it was a bookclub selection, so was mildly surprised by the tolerable 3rd section, which concentrated on Bali.  I did come away feeling I'd learned more about Bali than I have from any other source, not that I've had much exposure there.  I know that the book was NOT about the places she'd been, but rather, about herself IN those places.  Still, I think any reader is more interested in the place and not the writer's reaction to it.  Maybe if she'd been a more compelling character herself, I would have granted her that privilege.
B0010X745K|4.0|Very scary.  Glad I didn't see this in the theatre - I had to pause it 4 or 5 times.  The ending was horrifying!
0978607651|5.0|I gave this book to my husband for his birthday when I had to ackowledge that I would not find a decent copy of Harper's book on biology that Todd Oldham had when he was a child.  This is a more than adequate substitute, since it covers so much more of Harper's career.  Here in Cincinnati, his hometown, we all love him.  This book is a wonderful retrospective of his life's work.  Now all I need to do is find a spot big enough to keep it in!
B0014DBZT2|3.0|I've been a Nick Cave fan for only a few months.  I got turned on to him by following Tom Waits, and often times, stories I've read about Waits compare him to Nick Cave.  I bought \\"The Boatman's Call first and loved it immediately.  I then got \\"Tender Prey\\" \\"Your Funeral....my Trial\\" and didn't like them to much, but didn't give up on Nick.  Then I got the \\"Abattoir Blues Tour\\" two CD/DVD set and became a Nick Cave fan.  That four disc set is an incredible showcase of just how good NC and BS can be.  I have since purchased \\"Nocturama\\", \\"Abattoir Blues\\" studio discs, and lastly, \\"No More Shall We Part\\".  I love them all and consider myself a devoted fan.  That being said, I was looking forward to \\"Dig\\" and after getting used to it, I have to say I only dig half of it, which is still makes it a pretty good disc, but I prefer the brooding Cave more.  Nick Cave's ballads are his best efforts, in my opinion.  What a talented man!
B000002IWH|5.0|Well, I have to say this is easily one of the best soundtracks of all time. It really is an assembly of remarkable bands and some of which are well under the mainstream radar. Another added bonus is that many of these tracks are previously unreleased, and each one shows each respective band at the top of their game. Nine Inch Nails covering Joy Division? Are you kidding me? How amazing is that? All in all this is a stellar soundtrack, one I can pretty much enjoy from beginning to end. I must reiterate just how splendid I find it to have top name acts like Nine Inch Nails, The Cure, and Pantera alongside virtually unknown (except in the industrial world) acts like Machines of Loving Grace and My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult. An interesting mix of bands for sure, but fortunately for me I can appreciate it all.
B0000062GE|5.0|Darkest Days is quite simply an accomplishment in industrial rock. It is dark, haunting, beautiful, a truly timeless release. Chris displays such passion behind his lyrics and vocal work, a real treat to listen to, while the music that accompanies it is tight and very well put together. Anyone who has ever suffered from a broken heart can relate to this album on many levels. Unparalleled in it's depth, this is a release I can listen to over and over again and never tire of hearing it. The power and emotion contained within this release belongs in any collection and makes the dark times easier to cope with, and shines a dim light on otherwise painful situations. It just makes you feel like someone else understands the sometimes harsh nature of life.
B0007O38XU|4.0|Great spoof film and is one of Mel Brooks better films along with Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. This edition is loaded with great special features. The new documentaries are fun and informative, covering most aspects of the making of the movie from beginning till release. Most of the key players are involved which is great too. There are commentaries and other featurettes too. The transfer is excellent and they really show off the great effects which still stand up today. Pick this one up.
B000000H6Y|4.0|Currently their best album in my opinion, multiple unforgettable tracks entwined with offbeat filler. First, the filler. There is some strange stuff on this CD, and while not unenjoyable, it at times takes you out and away from the music and doesn't allow the CD to flow as well as it should. Now, onto the truly great stuff. One of my favorite songs of all time will be \\"Christian Woman\\". This three part epic is a stellar song that I have practically memorized over my mutiple listens. Next comes \\"Black No. 1\\", another epic and easily their most recognizable song, great stuff, but does not top \\"Christian Woman\\" in my opinion. \\"Summer Breeze\\" is an excellent cover song, improving greatly upon the original, essentially turning an upbeat, poppy song into a drab, droning gothic metal masterpiece. \\"Bloody Kisses (A Death in the Family)\\" is an ode to lost love, no album with gothic undertones is complete without it. \\"Too Late : Frozen\\" seems to be a faster paced song at first, until it slams into a wall to instantly become dark and depressing. Brilliantly done. \\"Blood & Fire\\" is also a great track, althought I prefer the Out of the Ashes Remix personally. And finally the CD closes with \\"Can't Lose You\\", a nice little closer that has a touch of country to it... What? That doesn't hurt the song however, in fact, it only helps it. So this is an excellent CD that I feel could have been streamlined a bit to help improve it. But I would still recommend this masterpiece to anyone.
0143038419|1.0|I'd read a good deal of these reviews before reading the book and still read it anyway.  What a waste of time.  It's not that the author is simply self-absorbed it's that she's self-absorbed and at the same time an incredibly self unaware person -- her repeated surprise at finding out that she's a control freak or that she's got \\"issues\\" about her serial monogamy are a surprise to only herself.  Eat is tolerable and Love is an interesting review of Bali but Pray is just a beat down.  If \\"Richard from Texas\\" writes a book I'd be interested in what he has to say about the ashram but this book is over-hyped and under delivers.
B00000IL26|5.0|This is another one of those recordings that I picked up on a whim only because it was recommended by [[ASIN:0141023279 The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings: Eighth Edition (Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings)]]. One listen and I was hooked like a dolphin in a tuna net. If your foot doesn't start tapping the minute the laser touches the etching, you're deaf or dead. And Morgan keeps it up through the entire recording, really embodying a jazz style that got lost in all the \\"cool\\" \\"avant-garde\\" \\"smoothe\\" music that followed close on this trend-setting album's heels. Multiple listenings do not wear thin, and even if I've been listening to Miles Davis for a week or I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for, Sidewinder always satisfies. This CD belongs in any serious jazz fan's library, and it would certainly add something to the casual jazz listener's library too. Put this on at your next party and I guarantee, the dancing will start and more than a few people will want to know the name of the CD so they can pick it up or download it for themselves.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|I thought it was mediocre, and like most, I have been awaiting this release for a decade.  I pretty much had the other cds on repeat over the last 5 years, so maybe it is just my anticipation that killed it.  I thought Beth's vocals were hollow but not in the great way that made other Portishead albums memorable.  In the \\"dilluted and weakened\\" sense.  I'm sorry but I have to be honest here, it seems like they went a little too deep into their imagination and pulled out melodies without much weight.  Perhaps it will get better with additional listening, but other than a few choice tracks, I don't hold this album up to the standard of their previous 3.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I think she has something in her voice as I just cannot dislike a single Madonna song. I can listen to all of her songs over and over again and they never get old. This album is no different.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Out of all the songs on this CD, there are only about three that I would like to listen to on the iPod for workout/treadmill music, and those are only for the music. They sound like 80s songs, esp Give It 2 Me. That one has a nice bass lick, but it's just an 80s dance song. What was a bit surprising was how bad her voice sounds on this CD. She was never exactly an opera singer to begin with, but on that song as an example, she sounds really deep, then goes to her original \\"Minnie Mouse on helium\\" voice. If this CD were instrumental it would be an average 80s style dance album. Her voice takes it down to below that.<br />\\"4 Minutes\\" is just horrid, unless you're under 20.<br />The sound itself is good, it pounds pretty well in the headphones.<br />I'm trying to be objective here, but for a woman who has recently said she wants to tone down the masculine look and be more feminine, why is this new CD cover showing a scary, S&M looking chick? The cover is unnecessary for another average dance CD. We've seen this, um, \\"side\\" of her since 1983, how about something new? Is this really all she can offer?<br />Basically, hardcore fans will love it, as they will anything she spits out. Those looking for music to work out to will find it just OK, but have the remote handy, or prepare to dump some songs for the iPod. As for the cover, have a giggle and toss it on the other Madonna soft core CD covers. After 25 years of \\"Look at my parts!!!!\\" posing, we see she can barely pose as anything else.<br />Gotta go with \\"lame.\\"
0141034599|5.0|\\"The Black Swan\\" may seem to be a simple concept, but the implications are more complex and deep than may appear at first glance. The leap from commonplace beliefs to the realization that many of them are just that: commonplace and wrong is as difficult as the leap was for physics from linear Newtonian systems to Quantum physics and non-linear systems. This means waking up to the fact that market crashes, bankruptcy are not freak events but part of the system, it mean that the heroes and idols are due to a perverse feedback mechanism of the media, it means, more importantly, that our complacency about how we treat nature and the environment carries with it risks we cannot even imagine.<br /><br />I recommend it.
1400063515|5.0|Ha!  My clever title has nothing to do with my review (or does it?).  Anyway, I found this book quite challenging.  As I've said in other reviews, I am quite the layman when it comes to statistics and probability.  But I think I got the gist of Taleb's concepts: we rely on flawed notions to make decisions or to view the world: the ludic fallacy; the narrative fallacy; the confirmation bias, etc.  Foolish men (I don't think there is even one instance of a woman being mentioned, as either one who gets Taleb's thinking or doesn't) in expensive suits push on us a Bell curve from the world of Mediocristan, giving a false sense of security (and depriving us of potential big wins) in a brave new world where Black Swans - those improbable incidents for which we are impecabbly unprepared - have hugely significant impacts on our lives.    Taleb's is a mind deeply immersed in many disciplines.  For those of us who spent our time in college waiting for Thursday to start partying, the subjects can be a bit challenging: philosophy, economics, financial analysis.  But if you want to stretch your mind, take the challenge.  There are profound and significant insights and learnings.  Can I describe them to you succinctly?  No.  It will probably take me a few re-reads to fully grasp it all.  Nevertheless, it's worth the plunge.  In any event, I will forever be skeptical about any information backed up by statistical analysis.
0307237702|1.0|I listened to the audio book.<br />His narration is entertaining.  The content of the book is meloncholy and full of flurishing.  There is no real meat here.  This is the story of a man whos father left him, he is taken to Indonesia, and his youth is<br />cluttered with no clear heritage or culture.<br />His mother seems to have jungle fever, and Barak indicates this in his comments.<br /><br />This man is simply a man distracted with the task of trying to establish<br />his value through his heritage.<br />My oppinion is he should just blaze his own trail and forget about<br />trying to be someone else.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Whether you've read PG Wodehouse's short stories or not, this series is fantastic for anyone interested in British humor.  While he is probably better recognized today as \\"House MD,\\" Hugh Laurie plays a complex yet relateable character in these four amusing seasons.    While the production quality and general feeling changed between seasons two and three, the first two seasons being excellent and the last two alright, the box set is worth the added price.  By the end of the 4th season there was a return to the old style, and brings nice closure to the series as a whole.    Worth every penny!
B00168HAOO|5.0|Upon walking out of the theater after having seen Cloverfield, I was dumb-founded with how amazing the movie was. Not to mention the amount of adrenaline that was going through my body, which rarely occurs, and I love the rush!     Just a note to those who saw it in theaters, if you got a headache or nausiated, I ensure you that the movie is easier to watch on a smaller screen and if you had your doubts about the movie after seeing in theaters due to those feelings, I urge you to watch it again on a smaller screen.    Anyways, as far as the movie goes, it was just simply outstanding. The story, the characters, the acting, everything! They took a Godzilla concept and threw in a twist of \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and added a shot of steriods. The result of how they created the movie was so real, it was presented to make it seem like it actually happened, making you more intruiged. The movie easily made it to my Top 5 movie list!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This movie was the perfect culmination of the StarGate SG1 series, I can hardly wait till the last movie. Great buy!!!
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|When she put out the record for 'Confessions' everyone definitely thought that the Madonna from back in the day was back, the Madonna that everyone learned to like...but now 'Hard Candy'--first of all, the cover is really bad, she looks tired and not appealing at all (she should have just left the candy and not herself on it!)...Second, some of the songs have a good beat, but only very few transmit good dance vibes...I only liked 'Miles Away', 'Heartbeat' and 'Give it to Me'.  4 Minutes by the way--I really have to say, Material Girl--you should have stayed away from the Hip Hop scene (leave that for the Real Queen of R&B/Hip Hop--Mariah Carey!!!
B000002KHB|3.0|A classic album?  Yeah, but again, the songwriting is weak in more areas than any Deep Purple album released before this one.    \\"Highway Star\\" is the ultimate speed metal song, as many people are aware by now.  \\"Smoke on the Water\\" with its amazingly catchy riff is pure genius as well.  \\"Pictures of Home\\" has the best vocal melody on the album.      \\"Space Truckin\\" is NOT very good though, because the vocals are poor.  \\"Lazy\\" is good, but the live version on Made in Japan destroys it.  \\"Never Before\\" has an alright guitar riff, but it's just filler anyway.   In fact, this is not an album I recommend because Made in Japan drastically improves many of the songs from this album.  Just buy Made in Japan instead.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Portishead moved from digital samples and cuts on Dummy to playing nearly all instruments on the 2nd self-titled LP. Their progression was not exactly seemless, but it set the standard for what to expect from the 3rd album aptly titled \\"3rd\\".  Dummy is an immediate success to the downtempo listener or the bluesy electro fan. Portishead, though it might take you off guard on initial assessment, is a substantial follow-up under any terms. I heard a lot of things about this new album but I left it to myself to form my own expectations and today being the day it was released in America, I am not surprised and definitely not disappointed.  The Live DVD brought me back into a \\"Portishead mood\\" sometime ago and I ended up buying the Live album and the 2-disc retakes, which kept my love for Portishead not only revived, but I would nearly say - more than ever. \\"3rd\\" landed at a great time with a definite sign of the times and an artistic progression that is DeFiNiTeLY in suit of the precedent set some ago - not only in quality, but frequency of releases. If you feel you can follow Portishead to the next level of enjoyment, then buy this! I can't see where this album could let anyone down no matter what degree of listener you may be.
0064430227|5.0|this is one of those books where not only do the children in my life enjoy this book, but i do as well. for a kid's book, it's pretty existential. A boy goes through this world where nothing exists and with his purple crayon, creates his world. What makes it more than just a kids book, what gives it the philosophical premise is that even though harold starts the story with this crayon, and has the power to draw anything, become anything, because all he need do is draw whatever he wants to be or where ever he wants to go, even though he has this power, he is unsatisfied and goes on a journey. he uses his crayon to create the world as he goes through it and ultimately finds some contentment, a resting place if you will :P, but the fact that he can create is irrelevant, its a means to an end. The implied 'end' gives us something to think about, and though the children who are meant to be reading this book will not go into such depth with the symbolism or the philosophy, they will pick up on some of the questions the author asks, like what is harold looking for? why did he need to do all that stuff if he was just going to end up back at home? (though actually he didn't start at home). even if the kids don't burst their brains thinking about this, even if they don't come to any logical conclusion, even if they don't ask any questions to begin with, i think exposing our kids to this kind of story is important. aside from being very amusing, it provides intellectual stimulation for those who look for it and for those who don't, well one day they may look back on this story as an example of some conclusion or another they have drawn. Even if they never understand the story philosophically, the fact that they are exposed to it will register somewhere in their heads and what they know of it will teach them something about life (as does everything, which always gets me critical of the constant stream of nothing we shove down our kids throats, like the bastardisations of stories presented by disney and now barbie... and lets not even talk about pop culture).<br />anyways, the kids i read this to love it. its a great story, i recommends presented by disney and now barbie... and lets not even talk about pop culture).   anyways, the kids i read this to love it. its a great story, i recommend
0679809015|5.0|I bought this book for my 2 year old daughter. She loved it from the first minute. She opens the doors over and over. And then she \\"reads\\" to me...  It's a nice little book with lots of flaps. And it's just the right size for little hands. We'll buy this book for our little friends.
0920236162|5.0|one of the reasons this story is great is because its one of the few books where the story doesn't end with the girl getting a guy. princesses and romance go hand in hand, even when the princess is a tough, adventure-seeking, swash-buckling tomboy, for the most part they end up with a guy. in fact stories with female protagonists that don't end up with a guy could probably be counted on one hand, its a huge part of our cultural perception of women and their happiness. in this one she flips the guy off and walks happily into the sunset by herself. especially at a time where stories like this are competing with barbie and bratz for our young girls, and i guess the boys who think the girls are like that, this is one of the more popular stories where the princess is smart and gutsy and gets things done to her satisfaction. its not even close to the only story like this, but as i say, one of the more popular. it teaches kids that girls aren't delicate pieces of glass and can yell out 'you are a bum!', which is funny and has none of the pretentious ideas about making little girls into little women instead of letting them be little girls. also, it has been commented that the story isn't the most literately complex, to those people i say you obviously haven't heard it live. it doesn't need to be a novel to get the message across. a lot of people i know and i see drill into their kids the need to always be challenging themselves, which is good, but they also don't let them do non-challenging things for fun, which is semi robotic. i mean they're just kids, who cares if its a line a page and that line isn't the most mind blowing sentence in the english language. if it fun, its ok. loosen up a bit.
B0012OQZWA|5.0|Finally, an Origin album where we can hear Mike Flores for--get this--a full 10 seconds! Seriously, that dude is a beast, and it would be nice if they could achieve more separation between the guitars and bass so that we can hear what Mike's doing beyond a few split-second solos. Anyways, awesome to see Turner back in the band. He has a more dissonant style than Ryan, and it's nice to have that contrast. Can't wait to see these dudes live next month.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|HARD CANDY is the first album in which Madonna totally goes mainstream by collaborating with \\"It\\" producers the Neptunes and Timberland with former boy band turned superstar solo act Justin Timberlake thrown in for good measure.  The end result is an album in which Madonna lets the producers take control of reshaping her music.<br /><br />The familiar Madonna themes are still here (sex, dancing, freedom of expression), but the music seems to be a constant tug-of-war between artist and producer styles, with the producer winning most of the time.  The weak opener \\"Candy Shop\\" could have been on a Britney Spears album, while \\"Spanish Lesson\\" and \\"Even The Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" seem like rejects from Justin Timberlake's JUSTIFIED album, and \\"Heartbeat\\" could have easily fit on Nelly Futardo's last album.<br /><br />However, when artist and producer styles meet, the results are quite fascinating on such tracks as \\"Give It 2 Me\\", \\"Dance 2Night\\", and the should-be-future single \\"She's Not Me\\", featuring Madge's best vocal performance on the album.  The charming \\"Miles Away\\" and the perculating \\"Beat Goes On\\" continue to provide even more quality tracks on this album.<br /><br />On HARD CANDY, Madonna proves that she knows how to conform well.
0061547832|5.0|This is an awesome book!  Donald Trump's passion and \\"take no-nonsense attitude\\" is refreshing and inspiring.  His passion explodes off the pages as he shares his insight on having a successful life.  I love how Donald shares his experiences - both the \\"failures\\" and \\"successes\\".  He sees failures as opportunities to learn what doesn't work and how success  will follow when you continue to \\"Think Big\\" regardless of whether the circumstances are in your preferences.  Reading this book comes at a perfect time in my life, as I work at a Bank and have just recently been promoted to an Analyst position.  It is now time to write this year's objectives for the next phase of my career.  The next promotion will be to an Associate, and I feel so inspired by Donald's book - that anything is possible when I \\"Think Big\\".<br /><br />Authors Ariel & Shya Kane strongly echo Donald Trump's keys to success in their books,  [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]], [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]], and [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]].  After reading these books by Ariel & Shya Kane, I quickly climbed the corporate ladder from Admin. Assistant, to Loan Service Admin., to Analyst - in just four years.  As I approached my job with excellence, I  have found satisfaction in all areas in my life.  If you find Donald Trump's book as inspiring as I did, check out the Kanes and discover that life becomes easy when you live in the moment, and success is a wonderful by-product.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|It's great. Over the last couple of years, Madonna has been doing something different for every album. It's great that she does that. I've never been bored with her work. Confessions On A Dance Floor was great. This is another great Cd. My favorite songs are Candy Shop, Heartbeat and 4 minutes.
1591391105|5.0|Clear and concise action plan.  Helps you think before just jumping in and running in circles.
B000V86OKG|3.0|After watching the first episode of the second season, I was somewhat disappointed. I couldn't put my finger on it, but the show seemed different. From the camera work to the acting, everything was a little off. But I reassured myself that it was due to the nature of the episode. The whole episode was about Dexter being a little shaken, off his game. But this feeling stretches into the season.     The acting doesn't seem to recover. And when I gripe about the acting, I should say it's still superior to much of what's on Television. I mean to say it's worse when compared to the brilliant acting of season 1.     It's not just the acting though. The story telling feels less developed. (Potential Spoiler) The scenes with Dexter's brother are particularly odd. It's hard to put my finger on it exactly, but they weren't done enough to really make sense. Dexter's new interest of love (or lust) is a good idea for a character, but poorly introduced and overly cliché. When Dexter meets with her at the Coffee shop after AA is particularly poor dialog. Julie Benz's character seems 180 from last season. You wouldn't even know they were the same person. There doesn't seem to be any chemistry with the children actors either.     Overall I feel this is still far more satisfying than a \\"CSI\\" type show. This is originality in the crime genre. However it is not nearly as polished as season 1. Everything from writing, to acting, to camera work seems less \\"tight\\"
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I've loved Madonna's music since the days of \\"True Blue\\" circa 1986. I was a little girl when I first heard \\"La Isla Bonita\\" over the radio, from then on I've been a fan. My favorite album of all time has to be \\"Ray of Light\\". Here it is 2008, and \\"Hard Candy\\" is great. She's been many things over the years, from the girl next door to the sexual provocateur , her sound and lyrics are always changing, but one constant remains the same, Madonna is the consummate entertainer, this album is a delightful addition to my record collection, as I am sure it will be to yours.
B000053ZRR|5.0|What can I say, but AWESOME!!! Jon, Ritchie, Bryan, and Tico, great as usual, well worth the money to buy.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|One of Madonna's best albums. Almost every song on the album is great. I once had my reservations and doubts about her collaborations with Timbaland and Pharrell, but I was pleasantly surprised. Confessions was an excellent CD and hard to follow up. However, Madonna did it again!! Long live the Queen!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Anyone who grew up with Madonna knows that she can do no wrong. She has been around since the 80s and no matter how she got there, she's arrived. You have to give to her, whether you like her or not.   I've grown up with Madonna, and my daughter - who is now reaching 13 in August - knows all of her songs and loves them from the Holiday CD to True Blue, and Hard Candy now. I love everything she has done thus far, and will continue to have her back no matter what. If an artist has been around for the 80s, 90s and the millenium, could you really have something else to say that hasn't already been touched on???
B00003ZKRM|5.0|To state Sibelius was the last epic composer perhaps may be sound exaggerate, but listening carefully his odd Symphonies, one may feel such steeled conviction fevered lyricism that sharply contrasts with the enraptured introspection of his even symphonies (specially the Fourth and Sixth).<br /><br />Keeping all these factors in mind, we should re-examine over and over his Pastoral musicality, filled of sustained and restrained lyricism absolutely improper of the artistic tendencies. He was one of the few composers who was always listening to his inner voices without halting just a bit from his bliss.<br /><br />John Barbirolli' s approach is a warm and honest homage to his artistic grandness.
6304806418|4.0|Evita starring Madonna is her best performance ever! She truly looks like Eva Peron, her voice has never sounded better and there's no trace of the \\"material girl\\" anywhere in sight. Antonio Banderas also stars, who knew this guy could sing his heart out. The songs are gorgeous and the cinematography is breathtaking. The only problem I have with Evita is their is no dialogue, it is just song after song but the songs are good. Give Evita a viewing soon.
1400096936|5.0|This story is a fast-paced adventure in Drug Cartel activities in Mexico and Southern California.  The character development throughout the book draws the reader into caring about each and every person - be they the Good Guys or Bad Guys.  I was sad when the story ended because it was so wonderful, I wanted it to continue...
0060833459|5.0|Peter Drucker was such a prolific and important writer, thinker, researcher, teacher, and philosopher! Although he is best known a the father of modern management theory, I find that his ideas are applicable to a wide variety of positions and enterprises.<br /><br />The Effective Executive, like most of his works, is written with the assumption that the reader is part of an institution and needs to learn to function within the challenges of the corporate environment. I have never had a traditional job or position in a large institution, but can totally relate to the challenges of what Drucker refers to as executives and knowledge workers.<br /><br />As a professional musician and holistic music teacher ([...]), I have worked to integrate the creative, intuitive sides of human nature with the organizational, rational aspects, both for myself and my clients.<br /><br />Like many artists, I was never taught the principals of management and have had to adapt and educate myself along the way. I owe a lot to Peter Drucker for helping me make sense of the nature of effectiveness and management.<br /><br />Drucker's wisdom transcends culture and  industry. Just the acknowledgement that effectiveness is a skill in-and-of-itself, apart from intelligence, talent, charisma, or creativity, is a powerful distinction. His encouragement that it can be (and must be) learned is a relief!<br /><br />His 5 basic practices for effective executives are invaluable insights. Here they are, paraphrased:<br /><br />1) Be aware of and manage your time<br />2) Focus on results, not efforts<br />3) Play to and develop strengths,  not weaknesses (yours and others')<br />4) Concentrate and align your actions and your purpose<br />5) Learn to make good decisions<br /><br />The examples in the book are a bit old-school, but the principles still hold true. Thank you, Peter, for putting  into words what so many of us were never taught at home or in school!
0131479415|4.0|This book is a well written synopsis of how an agile methosology should work, with adhering to a hard and fast methodology ( be it XP or SCRUM or Crystal). I would recommend this book to anyone who is using or is planning to implement an Agile setup. This book shows that Agile, does not mean 'no' planning, far from it, but shows that estimating project size is key to delivering on time and what is expected.  I recommend it to project managers and developers who are mature enough to understand that guess work makes everyone's job harder and that software is developed to support business needs that must lead to profit
B0014KD46W|4.0|After 2003 About Time[[ASIN:B000BKSIV2 About Time]] as a HUGE Winwood fan I was ecstatic about his new Jamming direction which he explained in the title   song \\"Different Light\\". His new Album NINE LIVES was billed as a continuation of that style. Although  the new Album does not contain the searing Hammond B or Guitar Solos(except Clapton's help on Dirty City), it has a great contemporary smooth jazz style with wide interludes( perhaps too wide on \\"Hungry Man\\"). Check out \\"Fly\\", \\"Other Shore\\", \\"At Times we do forget and \\"Raging Sea\\". As a 60 year old Winwood may be slowing down a bit but he is still Rocking on!!!(Could the same be said for Phil Collins or Billy Joel?)
0756404746|4.0|Oh it's ok I guess.  It's better than just about all of the new fantasy I've seen in the last few years.  How can I say this ... it's written well, but it's not written good.    Worse writers have written far better, more interesting books.  It reads easily, but then you, (I), just get bored with the smooth, even tempo.  I just don't really care what happens overmuch, and could have easily put the book down and forgotten about it at almost any time.  I never could read it for more than twenty minutes straight without needing a break.    I think the major problem is character development.  There were only two characters that interested me at all.  The girl from the drains.  I loved every brief moment she was on the scene, and, to a lesser extent, Denna, the chief female, (for lack of a better term).  Of the two, Denna was far less interesting, and her frequent absence was not cause for tension with this reader.    The \\"hero\\", and just a about everyone else, came across as a cliched cipher ... a plot device more that a person. (So did Denna, now that I think about it.)    In buying this book I broke one of my rules for unknown authors.  i.e., never buy a book whose blurbs come solely from fellow authors, no matter who they are.  I am invariably disappointed.  (For what its worth, I get best results from books that are praised by reviewers from medium to large sized city newspapers, unless its the New York Times.  I've never yet managed to get through anything the Times liked.)
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Anyone seen [[ASIN:B00003CXLS Godzilla 2000: Millennium]] or played the video game [[ASIN:B00024W1TC Godzilla: Save the Earth]]? Boy, if the Cloverfield monster isn't the spittin' image of the monster (Orga) that Godzilla battles in that movie and that game, then the Cloverfield monster is Orga's cousin for sure.<br /><br />And the Cloverfield monster deals out some serious damage on NYC, just like Orga would (or Godzilla would for that matter). And indeed, Godzilla was the inspiration for Cloverfield according to comments in the Special Features of the DVD by Producer JJ Abrams (also producer of the TV series [[ASIN:B0017HZZP0 Lost]], [[ASIN:B000H5V8DG Alias]] and [[ASIN:B0009SW83A Felicity]]).<br /><br />Cloverfield succeeds as a cool monster movie, but the shake, rattle and roll of the handheld camera in which the entire movie is viewed make for a miserable viewing experience. Sure, it adds an element of realism, but it is the most memorable part of the movie. In other words, the annoying handheld camera work is so distracting that it takes away from the story that is trying to break through all the jiggling.<br /><br />The acting is TV actor caliber (no surprise: the movie's chock full of TV actors and it has a TV director), but works pretty well from the perspective that the movie is being told (at least the acting was better than in a Godzilla movie!!!). Cloverfield almost seems like an episode of \\"Felicity in the City Meets the Monster.\\" This is not to say that I still was not highly entertained.<br /><br />A sequel to Cloverfield has been announced for a potential 2009 release. Let's just hope that Abrams stabilizes the picture for those movies. Let's also hope that the sequel is more about the monster and the forces battling it (like the way [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]] evolved out of the original), and less about the TV actors and their experiences.

B000ZBPQEO|5.0|A\\"MUST HAVE\\" collection for everyone who seriously loves classical music. There are MONO recordings as well as stereo ones but the sound of mono CDs is very satisfying and in many cases they are like recorded recently. If you are new to classical music, don't worry, there are plenty easy listening classical pieces here and over period of time you will fall in love with the rest of the pieces as well.  You will get the opportunity to listen to Karajan rehearsing Mozart symphonies with Berliners and that shows how meticulously Karajan dissects the music piece by piece till the players get \\"it\\" right. Many many thanks to EMI for achieving this marvelous project. I gave my old single CDs to local library so others could enjoy the marvelous music conducted by maestro Karajan. With the price offered here, this set is a real deal.
B00008EY9G|4.0|This is overall a good film as long as you stay away from spoilers.       I thought that the plot was very interesting but I found the ending to be slightly predictable- the person who ended up commiting the murders and the murder of someone towards the very end was something that I saw coming.     Sort of a Spoiler Here- The plot twist of making the least predictable person the murderer has been played out already.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|This album is not a return to form, as a lot of critics said, for this legendary group, but it represents just a return to rock! They've always been in form, and R.E.M. LIVE (2007)it's simply the best prove for what I'm writing! The previous two albums (Reveal 2001, Around The Sun 2004) were just too slow, but they anyway contains some pearls. Probably with a faster     production and a little more of guitars and drums the average atmosphere of these two albums could have been more familiar to the band fans and even a bit more commercial. Up (1998) sounds like an incomplete album, and probably this is due to the suddenly departure of Bill Berry at the beginning of the recording sessions. It definitely sounds a little too different from anything else in 1998, but this is very R.E.M.! R.E.M. has often been very different from their contemporaries, like for example in 1983, 1986, 1988, 1991, 1996 and this is what allows them to be considered so special and great!  They've always had an average creativity and quality level superior than any other band! Reveal and Around The Sun should sound a little less R.E.M.ish than the previous albums but to explore different patterns is what they've tried to do since the winter of 1979. They're R.E.M. and this is what they've always done!!!  Accelerate is a great return to rock, or to the kind of rock they have refined during the last quarter of century (alternative, indie, jangle, garage, sofisticated, post-punk/new wave as you prefer). It's probably the better album they've done since New Adventures In Hi-Fi (their best in my opinion) but this is very reductive for this album. Some critics said it sounds like Life's Rich Pageant and Document but it isn't at the same level. I think R.E.M. has never sound the same, only the quality level is often the same! Two random R.E.M. songs could sound the same only at first listen, but not everyone is able to catch exactly the differences: You have to feel their music more than listen to itto understand!  In my opinion Sing For The Submarine and Accelerate are simply two of the best song written in this millennium, Houston is a very deep song and Living Well Is The Best Revenge and Horse to Water are very catchy. The rest is on an high level, We will listen Supernatural Superserious and Hollow Man even in a not so close future!  The production isn't exactly what You expext from Jacknife Lee, the whole atmosphere is a little to loud, and artists like Mike Mills and Peter Buck always deserves the finest and clearer production it is possible to made. But this loud atmosphere fit very well with the usually great Stipe's lyrics, visceral as ever.  Someone said this album isn't as creative as they use to be until Reveal; I say that Accelerate sounds like R.E.M. Sounds in 2008 and this is enough for me!!!
B00005Q4CS|1.0|I feel that this is like a movie that was shot in the 80's. I don't know why but it seems old and past due for me. I have tried watching it on five occasions and have not gotten past the 25 minutes. Too bad. I expected more based on the reviews on here.

B000W4HJ44|5.0|Such a great movie - I've watched it over and over again!  My only gripe would be the lyric track...I was expecting you could watch the whole movie and then the words come up when there's singing.  However you can only watch the singing scenes while using the lyric track special feature.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Worst monster movie ever.  Viewing a 300 foot monster through a straw is not the right presentation.  The beginning of the movie was long, winded and boring; I started to yawn after 10 minutes.  The photography was literally nauseating and I could not wait until the camera was smashed by the monster.  The producers try to  makes us think that the Queasy-cam format is brilliant and refreshing; nonsense!  They probably did not have enough money to produce this movie so they hide their ill conceived ideas behind artistic license.  The producers should watch some Godzilla movies and learn how the masters do it.
B000W91RUG|5.0|When my husband first suggested we watch Big Bang Theory I told him I didn't want to because it was probably like every other sitcom out there and was probably going to be not worth our time to watch. But he insisted, and I'm SO glad I listened. It's now my favorite sitcom and I fully intend to buy it once it's released on DVD. It's rare for me to find a show where I'm laughing hysterically for practically the whole episode, but that's what this show delivers just about every time. :)
0307265730|5.0|The Unaccustomed Earth is impossible to stop reading because:<br /><br />1. Ms. Lahiri's short stories NEVER feel like short stories. They never feel fleeting or unsubstantial. They simply abduct you the way a 500 page novel can. Each tale is deceptively powerful...like shots of Tequila, and it only takes a few pages before you're reeling and forgetting your surroundings because you're suddenly transported to a garden in Seattle or at a wedding reception in the pouring rain.<br /><br />2. And she will drag you into that rain...<br /><br />3. And her characters are not the characters floating in the mind of a writer. They're not generic or vaporous or sewn together with the usual stale adjectives. You can't see the seams on these characters. You can't see where they begin or end because they don't begin and they don't end. When you meet them they're as alive as anyone you know and when you leave them at the end of a story, they go on without you, into rooms, into cars, into planes. They inhabit the world.<br /><br />4. And there are families and they are all tangled up, destroyed, yearning, redeeming, hating, aching, and not once, not for a single second did I pause when I was reading The Unaccusomed Earth and think, I don't really believe this or I knew that would happen...<br /><br />5. Ms. Lahiri's imagination is ferocious, stealthy, as endless as the ocean. You float into it because it's so smooth and effortless and then suddenly, deliberately, it's engulfed you.
006107327X|5.0|What a visially stunning book. Bruce Timm's artwork is sensationally brought to the reader through Chip Kidds fantastic use of photo design. This book thoroughly examines the behind the scene design concepts of Bruce Timm and Paul Dino and company with insightful reading on how they got to create one of TV's best animated series. A valuable piece of work collecting wonderfully laid out illustrations. Highly recommended for the curious and pure fans of the Batman character.
1582701709|1.0|The Secret is just another reincarnation of much older baseless spiritual claims and is really just an advertisement for all of the Secret's contributors.    Positive thinking and taking responsibility for one's life is the basis of a mature and fulfilling approach to life. However, thinking positive thoughts in an effort to \\"attract abundance\\" using the \\"Law of Attraction\\" is really just a form of wish thinking. How our thoughts alone \\"resonate\\" and \\"attract\\" everything we desire isn't explained in Byrne's material and has no scientific foundation whatsoever. This doesn't stop Rhonda Byrne from peddling the ever seductive notion that your thoughts are the cause of everything in your life and invoking scientific terms to describe it.    Yes, Quantum Theory isn't an easy idea to get your head around but devaluing such a grand theory by using it to pull the wool over people's eyes doesn't qualify Byrne for a nobel prize... well, maybe a nobel prize for quackery and clever marketing.    Anyway, I digress.     The most unethical notion in this book is that people who suffer horrific luck and bad fortune are actually to blame for it. The victim brought it all on themselves.     Despite it's central theme of \\"you create the reality you find yourself in\\" it actually contradicts this by teaching that thought alone will bring you everything your heart's desire. Ignoring the reality of a situation and choosing to wish think it to health is utterly irresponsible. This is particularly so when you read reviews from people who are delaying scientific based medicine because they're just confident it will go away.    Of course, many people will change their thinking and credit the secret for their success. All pseudoscientific claims appeal to this form of confirmation bias thinking.    The cause and effect nature of the universe can't just be condensed down to \\"I thought it then it came to pass\\". It's much more complicated than that.    Yes, you are a prime cause of many events inyour life and thoughts and emotions play a big part. Just don't be seduced into thinking that thoughts can be transmitted through some undiscovered medium to cause other things to happen that are completely unconnected.
B0013XS8A2|4.0|I am one of Mike Oldfield's big fans. Every new released album is automatically in my shopping cart.  This is a masterpiece, very inspiring and vivid. I listened to this new album for the first time while driving to work. It was a pleasant driving experience and didn´t care for the heavy traffic, I was just delighted by the music of the spheres.  The downside: Not a true innovation. You can once again easily recognize elements from the tubular bells (I, II, III), Guitars and other albums. If you no longer enjoy remixes and Tb sounds, you might not like this album. Otherwise, it is very good.
B0000AMRJC|3.0|My review is based on the picture and sound quality, not the movie itself which I love.  Scarface has been reviewed enough since its release and it is a great movie.  That's why I am so dissapointed in this release of it twenty years later.  If you own a 5.1 sound system like I do, you should wait for a blu-ray to come out cause this edition sounds really bad.  The claim of DTS 5.1 is b.s. and even the Dolby Digital sounds bad.  The picture quality is alot better and the music sounds alright.  The extras are not anything great.  Overall it's a mediocre release that is decent when played with a 2.0 system.  It really deserves better considering how popular it is.

B000V1Y43W|5.0|Out of the 30 or so HD movies I have seen this looks by far the best.  The backgrounds and details are so fine and really jump out in HD.  I am hoping that other Pixar movies like Finding Nemo look as good.  I am watching in full 1080p on a computer with a 24\\" widescrean LCD and 5.1 surround.  I am very picky about image quality and see few real actor movies getting very good images in HD.  About the only thing that comes close is nature and travel pictures in IMAX shows, but those are not as entertaining at Cars...  Yes I am 38 and still watch cartoons. :p    Update... even after going through over 100HD movies it is still one of the best.  It is a shame that Disney/Pixar does not release others like this to Blu-ray.  Monster Inc., Incredibles, and especially Finding Nemo would be great in HD.
B00139W3NE|4.0|The movie is just good entertainment like \\"Narnia\\", \\"Star Wars\\", or \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It has absolutely nothing to do with religion unless you consider people fighting for free will anti-religious, you belong to a meglo-maniac religion that likes to brainwash children, or you are a fan of the Spanish Inquisition. I suppose you could say a small part is religious since in their world their souls live in an animal known as a Daemon that keeps them company all their life. If either the animal or they are badly injured they both die and you see their dust disappear. But that is the only thing you can remotely say ties to religion. The rest the movie is about the adventure of a young girl and her daemon trying to get a golden compass to her father. Along the way they are hampered by a woman (rich and stylish Nicole Kidman) and her daemon (orange monkey with bad attitude) secretly working for the government, but Lyra is helped by her own daemon (switches between bird, feret, and cat), a group of people called Gyptians (Gypsies in steamships), a warrior polar bear (prince that should have been king but he lost a fight), a cowboy aeronaut (white haired and haggerd Sam Elliot that flies a balloon) and his daemon jack rabbit, and bow toting flying witches. The compass is a threat to the GOVERNMENT (Magesterium), not the CHURCH, since it tells the truth. The government is trying to suppress the truth since it has it's own spin on what it wants the truth to be. They have even gone to the extent of kidnapping children to brainwash them from childhood and separate them from their daemon. The ending is left up in the air like many trilogies. They talk of a war coming and Lyra's importance in the scheme of things at the end which sort of reminded me of the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" ending. So even though there is some scary stuff, it is in fact something like a childrens fairy tale. If you didn't think Grimm's fairy tales were scary as a child, then you don't know the meaning of the word. Overall good casting, acting, directing, special effects, music and sets. I recommend it to the whole family. Good quality DVD with plenty of replayability.the word. Overall good casting, acting, directing, special effects, music and sets.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|The tunes flow & stir emotion created by the movie. Would have preferred if the final song 'guaranteed', was split in 2; the song itself & then the instrumental. Instead there's a pause in the middle...which drags song duration onto 7:17 mins.  Great song though.

B000TCEU4Q|5.0|I'm a long-time fan of Microsoft Flight Simulator. I \\"fly\\" with the joystick in my left hand so that I can use the mouse with my right hand to click switches and look around the virtual cockpit. This makes using the joystick's throttle cumbersome, so I decided to get an add-on throttle. The Saitek Throttle Quadrant fit the bill perfectly.    Let me say up front that I was initially a bit leery about purchasing this unit because of reports of \\"phantom keystrokes,\\" but I'm happy to say I've been using it for several days with no problems whatsoever.    There is an included software disc but I would recommend not using it as it might be the cause of the problems some people have been having. I did not use it, nor did I need to--I simply plugged the unit into a USB port and Windows XP recognized it immediately. It showed up in the Game Controllers control panel and was configurable in Flight Simulator without the need for extra drivers or configuration software.    Note: If you're using this with Flight Simulator, in the Flight Simulator Settings > Controls > Calibration screen select the Saitek Throttle Quadrant as the Controller Type, then select Simple Controls and set the Sensitivity to maximum and the Null Zones to minimum. If you don't do this you won't get the full range of control from the levers. You can set each controller individually, so doing this won't affect your joystick or yoke if you're using one.    The included desk clamp mounts to either the bottom or back of the unit, giving you a couple of different options as to the position of the unit in relation to your desk. I found the desk clamp to be secure and foolproof.    Functionally this unit is exactly what I wanted. The levers are the perfect size, move smoothly, and have a long range of motion. This gives you much better precision than a standard joystick throttle wheel. At the minimum setting you can feel a little indent in the control; if you move it below that you trigger a joystick button. Thisis handy for functions like reverse thrust or brakes. Additionally, there are three rocker switches on the bottom of the unit, perfect for controlling things like flaps and elevator trim.    The handles on the levers are colored and shaped just like real general aviation power controls. The handles are interchangeable, and Saitek thoughtfully included extra handles to allow you to reconfigure the look of the unit for things like multi-engine aircraft. I've read that you can use more than one of these units at a time, and the ability to reconfigure the handles can come in handy in more complex setups.    I have only one complaint about this unit, and that is that the USB chord is a little short at only about 4 feet. If you're using this unit in conjunction with Saitek's flight yoke (which has a USB port in it) the short chord is actually a good thing, but if you're using the unit as a stand-alone like I am you may need a USB extension chord. Not a big deal, just something to be aware off.    All in all this unit exceeded my expectations. There's nothing like flying a tricky approach and having a real throttle controller to make precise power adjustments. I have no \\"phantom key press\\" problems, and if you purchase this unit I would recommend bypassing the included software CD as that might be the source of problems some people are having. No problems for me, and I'm really happy.
B00005JKQ6|1.0|This movie is really, really, **REALLY** bad.      \\"HOW BAD IS IT?\\"      (Thank you, Johnny Carson, wherever you are.)     This movie is so bad the extras are now in the witness protection program.    Remember the last time you watched a really dreadful movie, and you kept watching it because there was a certain \\"perverse aesthetic\\" to its awfulness.  At a certain point you hoped that, rising like a phoenix, the movie would redeem itself and at least achieve the level of \\"camp.\\"      Alas, not so in the case of ... \\"The Swimmah!\\"     When you see a movie like this, you're grateful your vocabulary includes words like horrendous, hideous, dreadful and wretched.  In short, to quote my old Algebra teacher Father Joseph when we messed up an equation: \\"P.U. on you!\\"       I used to think, before I saw this movie, that Burt Lancaster, great actor that he was, simply couldn't be in a bad movie.  That his mere presence would make a movie interesting. ... But, alas, not this time, Burtmeister, not this time.  C'est dommage.      (By the way, \\"C'est dommage\\" -- that's French for you peons.)    Well, ok, where to begin? ...     \\"The Swimmer\\" is a 1968 adaption of one of John Cheever's best short stories.  So why did the geniuses at Columbia Pictures change it?  The screenplay not only deletes key scenes, it also inserts characters into the movie that aren't in Cheever's short story.  (Needless to say, the screenplay was not written by the great John Cheever.)    The truth is, this movie could easily have led to a murder.  Not a movie murder but a *real* murder.  See, there's this pool scene in which John Cheever makes a brief cameo appearance, and when Burt Lancaster first notices John Cheever, I swear, there's this look of *fear* in Burt Lancaster's eyes, as if to say: \\"Please don't kill me, Mister Cheever.  Please don't strangle me with your bare hands for lousing up your story.\\"     The (you'll-excuse-the-expression) \\"highlight\\" of this movie is the scene with Burt Lancasterand Joan Rivers.  Yes, that's right, you heard me correctly, Pilgrim: *the* Joan Rivers is in this obnoxious, abominable, abhorrent, repugnant, repulsive, putrid, wretched, awful, disgusting, distasteful movie. ... Like a fish in water, old Joan was!    As far as how Joan Rivers looked in 1968, let's put it this way -- rumor has it that one of the plastic surgeons who worked on her back then fled the operating room, sold his home in Beverly Hills and became a Trappist monk.              Joan, plays (are you ready for this?) a \\"femme fatale.\\"  Or, more accurately, a suburban floozy.  A suburban floozy who has eyes for Burt Lancaster.      Nothing personal, Joan, but you had as much chance with Burt Lancaster as Lassie had with Errol Flynn.      ATTENTION! -- BOOGER ALERT! -- BOOGER ALERT! -- BOOGER ALERT!     Now I'm going to tell you something about the scene in which Burt and Joan appear that you're not going to believe.  Repeat: that you're *NOT* going to believe.  Nevertheless, it's the Gawd's honest truth.      Ready?     OK.  Believe it or not, in the scene with Joan Rivers and Burt Lancaster, there's a booger in Burt Lancaster's right nostril.     Now, I'm going to repeat that once more -- slowly and clearly -- for the West Coast. ...    In Joan Rivers' scene with Burt Lancaster there is a booger, clearly visible, in Burt Lancaster's right nostril.  A big, round, gray booger.     I kid you not.    And they call Joan Rivers gross!    Folks, I'm serious.  I'm as serious as a fat lady trapped in a pastry shop.  I'm as serious as Mickey Rooney schtupping Mother Theresa.  I'm as serious as Donald Trump placing in a frowning contest.    I played the Joan Rivers-Burt Lancaster scene three times on my DVD player, and it's there!  The booger lives!  IT'S A-LIVE!!!    Evidently, no one in the production company saw it.  But, I mean, is that possible?  Is it possible that no one who worked on this movie saw the booger in Burt's schnozola?      Maybe the people who madethis movie were so desperate to finish this turkey that they didn't look at *any* of the movie while they were filming it.  That's one theory as to why there's a booger in Burt Lancaster's nose -- because no one in the production company saw it.     Still, hard to believe, no?    Another theory is that knowing Joan Rivers holds the lifetime achievement award for \\"Chronic Bad Taste By a Female Performer in a Nauseating Role,\\" could it be that she *insisted* the booger be inserted in Burt's nose, or else she wouldn't do the flick?     Not likely.     Not likely, in that Joan didn't have that kind of star-power back in '68.  But  nowadays -- nowadays, with Madame Joan's clout stronger than ever -- snot, boogers, ear-hair, eye-mucous.  That crazy b**** can make it happen!  What a performer!  Cue the body fluids!  Action!!!       Now, I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking, there isn't really a booger in Burt Lancaster's nose, ole Sal's making it up, right?   But I swear to you, on the souls of Don Corlieone's semi-legitimate grandchildren, that it's there.  Perhaps someone who reviews this movie after I do will testify on my behalf.  The booger is there.  And in plain sight.      Listen, I know, at times, I kid around.  But about a booger?  In a major motion picture?  NO SIR!  (I have my standards!)    By the way, in case you think the Burt Lancaster-Joan Rivers scene was the worst scene in the movie, I have more bad news for you.  It wasn't.  There were, in fact, far *worse* scenes.      For example, there is a scene -- an *interminable* scene -- toward the end of the movie with Burt Lancaster and Janice Rule that is, without a doubt, the worst-acted, worst-conceived, worst-written, worst-directed, worst-produced, worst-lit, worst-blocked, worst-staged, worst-designed, worst-dubbed, worst-filmed scene in motion picture history.  And that includes when Aristotle made shadow-puppets on the wall of the Parthenon back in 44 B.C. to impress his (Jewish) girlfriend Shirley.  (How else could he score with her?)       I read recently that Janice Rule gave up her acting career and became a psychoanalyst.  And, by God, this movie may have done it!      Then, there's the ending to the movie.  And, oy vey, what an ending! ... ... At last, we're shown the denouement of the Burt Lancaster character.  ... And shown the denouement of the Burt Lancaster character.  ... And shown the denouement of the Burt Lancaster character.  ... And shown the freakin' denouement of the freakin' Burt Lancaster character.     Folks, the ending of this movie went on longer than it took Methusela to count the dough he got from his Social Security check.      \\"OK, WE GET IT!\\" I yelled at my teevee screen.  \\"Burt Lancaster gets screwed by his entire family.  Enough already!  Please, pleeeeeze, if there's a God in heaven, please let me see those two words 'THE END' before I rent a Kirosawa movie and commit harikari.\\"    And then, finally, it was over.  (Free at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty I was free at last.)     But, you know what.  I didn't feel liberated.  I didn't feel free from this lousy, dreadful, simply *awful* movie.  No, no instead, I felt ... cheap.  And used. ... Tacky and tawdry.      I wanted to strip naked and run through the streets proclaiming: \\"I AM UNCLEAN!  I AM UNCLEAN!\\"      But it was cold out and I chill easily.    Still, as cheap and tawdry as I felt, at least I didn't have a big gray booger in my right nostril.       ---- CODA ----    I'm sorry to keep bringing up this booger-business, but for days after I watched this movie, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Right there in Burt Lancaster's right nostril: a big fat ole booger.      \\"No,\\" I said to myself, \\"no, it's not possible that the people who made this movie didn't see it.\\" ... And then it hit me! ... I bet the people who made this movie got their heads together and said: \\"Listen, this movie is so far in the toilet, Ed Norton couldn't save it.  There's obviously nothing we can do to salvage this turkey, so let's reshoot Burt and Joan's scene and this time put a big gray booger in Burt's nose.  You know, mise en scene. And all that crap.\\"      Why? you ask.  Why go the booger route?  Simple: to sell tickets. To save this movie from financial disaster.  To create a buzz about this movie so that people, such as myself, your humble and obedient servant Salvatore (you can call me Sal) say to their friends and associates: \\"Hey, wow, did you see the movie with the big booger in Burt Lancaster's right nostril?\\"     Listen, big money was riding on this flicker.  Who knows how desperate the investors were.  Gary Cooper once peed in Cary Grant's swimming pool just to make a point, so why not feature a booger in a Burt Lancaster pool-pic and hope to break even.       (Oh, the liquidity.)
B00000AOUD|5.0|When I heard this album for the first time in the 70's I was ecstatic. Tull had changed paths from their previous bluesy/folk rock roots and created a 43-minute song that was incredibly exciting. Even the LP, which folded out like a newspaper and was filled with goofy articles, was fun to read. It was a total audio/visual experience. Back in the day, friends would get together, party, and listen to music for hours. It's been decades since I, or any of my friends, have done this and I miss it. Anyway, times change, but time has not changed how incredible this song is. The music, arrangements, musicianship, lyrics, production, everything about this record is magical.      Finally, it's ludicrous that Tull have not been inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame so far. What's up with that? In my opinion, they are one of the class acts of rock. A band that can put out several great albums, and consistently perform killer live shows for forty years is very special indeed.

I have read others reviews about this book.  I think the main disagreement people have is that the book is not an in depth explanation of Buddhism.  And that is true.  But it is not meant to be that.  The main purpose of this book is to awaken, as it says.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|I thought \\"Cast of Thousands\\" was a brilliant album, and although I liked \\"Leaders of the Free World\\" a lot, I didn't think it was quite up to its predecessor's standards (mind you, Station Approach remains to be one of the best Elbow songs ever). But this one... this one is \\"Cast of Thousands\\" + 1. It is absolutely wonderful. There is not a weak track on the album!     \\"Some Riot\\", my favourite on the album, is right there in the same league as \\"Switching Off\\", so ripe with raw, unprocessed emotion that it's breaking my heart too, whenever I hear it.    As for the comparisons with Coldplay, with all due respect, Elbow's shoes are far too big for Coldplay, they could never fill them. Coldplay may have written some catchy tunes, but none of them (save for maybe Yellow) even come close to the many-layered magic that is Elbow.     I highly recommend this album, greatness like this is seldom seen indeed.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|First, the simple \\"sound bite\\": Hated it!    Now, for a bit more commentary....    This \\"movie\\" represented--to me at least--much of what I think is wrong with the current state of \\"television entertainment.\\" The fact that this work was represented as a \\"movie\\" (rather than as a long episode of a \\"Reality TV\\" show) was its only real novelty. I can summarize the good and the bad aspects of this work as follows:    The Good  1- It wasn't too long.   2- The CGI effects of the monsters and the destruction of NYC were surprisingly good.   3- There was some excitement generated by some of the scenes (although in each case they were cliques that were not original ideas by any means).  4- Ah, I was able to rent it for free (I had a coupon).    The Bad    1- It seemed really, really long (and was mostly boring except when the CGI was in full bloom). I suppose that perhaps a case could be made for fast-forwarding through the DVD just to see the CGI scenes.    2- Although the monster part of the story was a tiny bit novel, the \\"characters\\" and their dramas were not at all interesting or original. Of course, for a generation that's used to the depth of drama in most so-called \\"Reality TV\\" shows, the \\"script\\" made perfect sense. Watch the party scene (if you can stomach it) for a second or even third time. Then try to imagine how these characters and their motivations might be portrayed in a \\"real\\" movie with a real script and real actors. See? This is very-dumb-made-for-Reality-TV stuff could never be translated into a proper dramatic movie. Of course, this is one reason why the producer (the \\"Lost\\" guy) could get away with making this movie...he didn't need to spend any money on actors or a scriptwriter because he knew so much would be \\"forgiven\\" because it would, after all, be \\"seen\\" by the viewers as being \\"filmed\\" by a kid using a hand-held HD camcorder. Neat, huh?    3- Speaking of \\"scripts\\" (or the lack thereof), the characters are made to do some really stupid things forsome really stupid reasons. There are some very large plot holes throughout, too. The simple motivation of the main male character (the guy who suddenly says \\"I've got to go back and get my girlfriend in spite of the fact it will mean all our deaths including my brother who was killed before my eyes\\") was needed to keep all the characters in the line of fire. But the fact that the three follow-along characters are actually dumb enough to go along with the \\"hero\\" simply shows (to me) how stupid kids are today. At the very least, the script is making a cynical comment in assuming that teenagers (or 20-somethings) can be expected to act like sheep in such a \\"disaster.\\"      4- The fact that the lights stay on (nearly everywhere) in spite of the major damage being done to NYC is a very-hard-to-believe plot device. But the plot device of the cellphone that works well enough (and several times at that) to allow the trapped girl to call her boyfriend and plead for his help is absolutely beyond belief. But, again, to the intended audience who are literally tied to their cellphones and iPods and who generally don't care how those things actually work (i.e., they are little radios that depend on big radios working) it makes perfect sense. That is, the expectation of a suspension of disbelief by the intended audience is logical, but only in a cynical sense.     5- Regarding the long sequence of the three characters climbing up the stairs to the top of a building and then jumping over to the almost-ready-to-collapse building in which the hero's \\"girl\\" is trapped because she is impaled on a piece of rebarb....wow, I'm almost breathless just from trying to explain the crazy plot! As I mentioned earlier, the tag-along characters are represented as sheep who (in spite of an opportunity to get out of town with the military) are willing to follow their \\"hero\\" just so they can fill some time or \\"hang with him\\" or be there to capture his heroics on video....(wow: breathless again). Well, here these people are no longer characters--they become actors in a scripted scene. At this point, the audience will \\"believe\\" anything, therefore the characters can be made to \\"do anything\\" without regard for their safety or sanity or--dare I say it?--basic physics in the real world. My point here is that because of all the stupid things the kids have done so far in the story we expect (and actually we need) the characters to be able to safely rescue the poor girl (who oddly isn't dead from a loss of blood and who survives being pulled off the metal rebarb that is holding her and can actually manage to walk down the building with ease...). Once they all get back into the building they climbed up in I thought for one vain moment that there was hope that one of the small monster creatures would grab the hurt girl (or all of them for that matter) and stab her to death. If that happened at least there'd be some irony in this story. But no, the secondary hero (who actually is killed later by the big bad monster itself) is able to put the camera down long enough to kill the nasty small monster. And then they all move along nicely and quickly to the bottom floor and out the building. Sweet. What a cool story. Makes perfect sense. No trouble at all; they saved the dude's girl. Naturally.    6- The camera work throughout was both bad and good. It was good in the sense that it captured some of the \\"reality\\" of a hand-held camera. But, it was bad in the sense that the kid who was operating the camera couldn't have captured the actual video that was shown (i.e., the video was \\"too good\\" too much of the time). Of course, if this \\"video\\" were shown as being truly \\"Blair Witch\\" quality, no one would have watched this movie all the way through. [We have to have some standards you know. This is a movie of the week! We want people to think it is real but not too real!]     7- The resolution of the story (i.e., everyone dies except the one girl who, presumably, gets out on the first helicopter) is so typical of all of today's end-of-the-world scripts. The hero/heroine die for no reason really except because it's in the script. Come on...what happened to the dramas of yesteryear? In the past (before 9/11), stories of the end of the world (from whatever cause) would end in an emotionally satisfying way: that is, most or at least some of the main characters would survive due to their actions or dumb luck. But they survived. We want them to survive....that's the point of these stories. If you don't believe me, go back and study the history of movies and TV scripts (in this genre at least). The hero/heroine survives somehow. Sadly, in the \\"Post 9/11\\" scriptwriters guide, everyone (except a random one or two) will die. all these stories end up repeating the \\"point\\" of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. And that point is this: most will die, it doesn't matter what anyone tries to do...or is made to do by the scriptwriters...they will die. One or two will randomly be saved, but that salvation has no meaning except for pure chance. And that's where I will end this commentary: this \\"Reality-TV\\" version of the 9/11 attack on NYC is lame. Skip it.
B0012RCMH4|5.0|This is a basically solid release introducing Tom Warrior's early band to those of us not in the know all these years. Both discs are a heavy crust/blackish metal attack and the listener can hear a lot of early Celtic Frost in there. Many of the tracks are obvious predecessors to Morbid Tales--dinosaur heavy, with Tom Warrior's guttural growls all over. It's really a great find.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Music is original, Lyric writing great     This is RUSH ..nuff said
B00104QSOM|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis is brilliant. With too many movies nowadays, you can't have a quiet moment without people calling your movie boring, but it's the contrast of the quiet moments that make the action that much more intense. This movie accomplishes that juxtaposition. You get comfortable in your seat, then something startling shakes you up. Plenty of other reviewers have discussed the plot and some have pointed out comparisons to \\"Citizen Kane\\" which I think is perfect. This movie will be studied by filmmakers for some time. I understand it might not be some people's cup-of-tea if they are squeamish when it comes to violence, but you'll miss out on some spectacular storytelling if you miss this film.  I'm looking forward to the Blu-Ray version.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Isn't it interesting that Madonna's latest \\"Hard Candy\\" and Duran Duran's latest \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" both feature contributions from the likes of Justin Timberlake and producer Timbaland, yet Duran Duran's album is light years better: as a dance record, as a pop album, lyrically, vocally, you name it. And this is not the first time we've been subjected to Madonna's \\"gansta bitch Barbie\\" persona [\\"Music\\", anyone?] It didn't work so hot then, it still aint working now. Worse, she really does come off like some 'past it' veteran riding the coattails of Furtado, Stefani, etal. Sad, very sad. The song structures are awkward and contrived, her vocals sound pretty tame, and those lyrics would embarrass Hannah Montana, for Chirssakes! Of course, the Madonna fanbase of cultist proportions will not approach this CD with even an ounce of objectivity, and dismiss any honest criticism as mere 'hating', but when you consider Miss Thing just got inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [over older musicians who've actually recorded rock music for three decades,] giving her a free pass with this mess of urban contemporary iPod fodder would be really inexcusable. And let's not even discuss the abysmal duet with Justin \\"4 Minutes.\\" It felt way, way longer listening to it - less Kabbalah, more songwriting classes, please.

If you own a HD DVD, this is the disc to own.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I will make this brief and straight to the point:  Hard candy is an excellent album. I had qualms regarding the naming of this album and I still do. Hard candy is a cheesy name for a non-cheesy album. But let me go on with the review. Like all Madonna albums, hard candy gets better and better with multiple listens. In fact, even the songs that have already been heard, like miles away and 4 minutes, get better with multiple listens as the different layers of the song's melody and beats are detected. Like all Madonna albums, hard candy has at least one song that tackles the concept of music and the euphoric and therapeutic effects that music exerts on the listener or the dancer. And as you all know by now, Madonna does her best and produces her finest whenever the song is about the virtues of music.  Like all Madonna albums, Hard Candy has songs that should not have been there. This is ok because it is just about the only thing that makes Madonna appear human like us in the sense that she is not perfect and that she, like the rest of us, slips every now and then. And now onto the songs:    Candy Shop (6/10): this song has been heard already. It is an ok song. It will be skipped by most listeners because it is not remarkable in anyway and it has been heard quite a lot already.    4 mins (10/10): if I could point out an under-rated song on Hard Candy, it would probably be 4 mins. This song has a beautiful melody and killer beats. It is new, in fact futuristic, and very upbeat. Still, people do not seem to give it its worth probably because of premature excessive exposure to poor sound quality leaks. Go timbo! Go madge!  4 mins gets nothing below a 10!    Give it to me (10/10): this is the essence of Hard Candy. It is a song to be heard, not described! Killer beats, uplifting lyrics, gorgeous rhythm ...this song is probably a re-incarnation of madonna's old song everybody! When Madonna says \\"give it to me\\" think \\"everybody\\"; when she says \\"no one's gonna show me\\"....think \\"common dance and sing\\".......nothing below a 10! Expect this song to be played in clubs.    Heartbeat (10/10): this is madonna's gift to those who like pink, nelly furtado, and urban rhythms. The Say It Right type of beats are all over the song superimposed on a gorgeous melody. The first time I heard this song, I almost cried when Madonna said \\"once I get going I am gone\\" . The ending of the song has a very nice beat that comes with the words \\"madolla, madolla, madolla\\"    Miles away (10/10): I give this song a 10 simply because it is the highest score I can give; miles away is a superb song. it is rich and multilayered both lyrically and musically. The subject matter of this song is very unique. Many artists have tackled the experience of long distance love. But this is the first song that I have heard that actually tackles the experience of being with someone who seem to want you and love you only when you're....hhmmm well, not around.... One must wonder how the heck Madonna thought of that? Is this something she herself is going through? Who knows? Anyways, the song has a gorgeous ending sound in the last 30 seconds.    She's not me (8.5/10): this song's true potential is a 10/10. Unfortunately, she's not me got molested, raped, and beheaded by its own producers. This song has a beautiful melody and a good beat. The subject matter is amusing too. Unfortunately, it has a bombastic incongruent midsection that is truly irritating to the ear, especially if you're using headphones; it attacks the song and its atmosphere abruptly and mercilessly rips it apart for 30 seconds starting right at the end of the 2nd minute of the song. Also for some reason, the producers did not allow the song to finish gracefully and just kept it dragging on and on.... Every time you think the song is coming to an end, it all of a sudden starts again. At some point, you also hear someone say \\"gotta find a new way to express your\\"....whatever...but the tone is very annoying and incongruent.  Such a shame because it's actually a great song.     Incredible (4/10): this is a bad song. It is redundant, strange, messy, and too dam long. On top of being a bad song, it just drags on and on refusing to let go of your tired ears. Most people will listen to incredible a few times and then never listen to it again. I am not going to talk about this song more because it does not deserve being described.     Beat goes on (10/10): this is perfection! A treat to the soul, an invitation to let go of the day's stress. Excellent melody, beats, and rhythm. This song should be heard and not described. Everything about it is great and done just right. All in good taste, even the rap in the end is in good taste.    Dance 2nite (10/10): once again Madonna does what she does best. Enough said. Go listen to this song. Gotta Go fast fast fast , if you want this good thing to last. Her voice is just great along with JT's. you don't have to be beautiful to be understood. You don't have to be rich and famous to be good.....i wanna dance tonight so take a chance tonight.....  Spanish lessons (1/10): this is a stab right into the left ventricle of the heart of Hard Candy. It is awful to say the least. It's bad and annoying. It truly irritates the ear. Avoid it like the plague, especially if you have headphones on. It would ruin the entire atmosphere of hard candy. Whatever damage incredible had inflicted on the album, Spanish lessons completes that damage. Listen to this song at your own risk.    Devil (10/10): Excellent ballad. Just perfect in every way you can think of. Like the other 10/10 songs on this album, this song is addictive and will make you listen to it repeatedly because it just sounds so good.  Go timbo!!! I hope Madonna makes a video for this one.     Voices (10/10): this is the song I listen to the most. I listen to voices at least once everyday. It's short and it could have been a bit longer I guess. Maybe I say that because it's an awesome song. by the way, this and devil, along with miles away, are the most lyrically rich songs in the album. Voices is a wonderful ending for the album. Madonna's superb taste in music can be felt all throughout this song from beginning to end.     Ring my bell (5/10): there's a reason why this is a bonus track! Still, if Madonna was truly hell bent on having a 12-track album, then this song would have been a totally acceptable and more palatable alternative to the annoying horrendous Spanish lessons.     The cover art: while I absolutely adore this album, I do think that the cover is ghastly! Why the weird concentric cheap looking pinkish circles behind her is anyone's guess. Why are her legs and hair cut out from the picture? And why is she wearing this trashy leather/boxing outfit thingy? And why is the facial expression erotic? This album is not about sex and it is not cheesy either. Therefore, the cover art is just out of place. Besides, I do like Madonna and I do believe that she is in good health but there are certain things and certain moves that a 50 y/o mother should not do because it's just not classy. The cover of COADF was also colorful and a bit erotic but it was in good taste.     Summary: Hard Candy is an excellent album overall. However, Madonna, like the rest of us, is not perfect and that shows in hard candy, as it sustained 4 stabs: 1-cheesy name that has been used for a stupid horrible movie about a little brat torturing a pedophile. 2-ghastly cover art. 3-incredible. 4-spanish  lessons. But one has to admire an album that took 4 hits and yet remained alive.......

0452289963|1.0|The first page of the Tao te Ching says something like \\"the tao cannot be explained.\\" And then, Lao Tzu goes on to write a whole book explaining the Tao, which cannot be explained. That is so FUNNY! I love it. Tolle does a similar thing here - he explains how to awaken to your life's purpose, but then asserts that only you can really know how to do that for your particular journey. So basically he writes a book saying, \\"I am going to tell you how to do something that only you can know how to do for yourself.\\" If there is no \\"right way\\" or \\"wrong way\\", then what are we even talking about? Why not just twiddle our thumbs and nod at each other? Hey, I bet that's why monks just sit there and nod at each other. HAHA. That's funny. I made myself laugh. Monks. Nodding. And farting. HAHA Farting monks.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|This album takes me from happy to melodramatic and bittersweet. Dilla, Bless His Soul was a genius.  He has influenced so many artists from our generation and the next generations.    I have to agree with some of the folks reviews...you can see Dilla's connection with a higher power, the ether, in the music he creates on Donuts.  You even start to sense he could see into the future, the things to come.  This is Majestic, this inspired by something greater than we can understand.    Dilla was selfless. In this album you see his genius. I can go on but there are no words to even describe it.  Genius-how he did this can only be that he heard and felt something that may have been invisible to us. And he was able to create it.    Thank you J Dilla.

B00004RF8J|5.0|In the early 60's in the grimiest part of New York City, Plant shop owner Mushnik (Vincient Gardenia) and worker Seymore Krelborne (Rick Moranis) are having bad business with their store. However during one day when Seymore was looking for unusual and weird plants while during an esclipse of the sun, he discovers a strange venus-flytrap at a Chinese plant shop and buys it. With the plant being the main attraction of the store, the flower shop becomes very successful on Skid Row for Seymore and he falls for a girl named Audrey (Ellen Green) who has been physically abused by her mean and insane dentist boyfriend (Steve Martin). The plant nicknamed Audrey II (Voiced by Levi Stubbs) is actually a man-eating alien plant creature from space that wants to make Seymore's wishes and successes come true if he can dismember some people.<br /><br />Featuring appearences by Jim Belushi, Bill Murray and Christopher Guest this is a marveleous musical horror Sci-fi comedy extraganza. Based on a successful broadway musical from Alan Menken and Howard Ashman which was inspired by a cult 1960 Sci-fi horror comedy cheapie flick, director Frank Oz really captures the elements of Corman's movie with both the play on film. The performances by the cast are just outstanding including the musical numbers which are very memorable, the Audrey II effects still hold up today as they are just amazing especially the lip synching of the creature. I remembered seeing this in theaters in St. Louis when i was 4 3 times and having the movie magazine, cards and Audrey II bank as i loved it, it's always been one of my fave sci-fi horror comedies ever and it originally had a darker ending but due to preview negativity the filmmakers had to make a more happy ending but it still works.<br /><br />The new blu-ray features the director's cut with the 20 minute bleak ending and the theatrical cut, Trailers, commentaries, deleted scenes and featurettes. The picture and sound is excellent as well.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|As always, madonna has managed to put another great album way different than the hip hop crap there is out there.   On this one like all her other albums she goes the extra mile and gives us a unique product with excellent and innovative music. I have only listened to the album once and I can't get the songs out of my head. Especially 4 minutes and hearbeat.   Many people are complaining about the cover or trashing her music, but that's just a way to put the new album down. She is the only artist in the world who has managed to do artistically what she wants how she wants it and when she wants it  for over two decades and will always be respected for her work.    This album does not sound like bedtime stories, Unlike bedtime stories this is dance oriented with exceptional tracks.    There will always be one Madonna, and this here is the real deal. If you don't belive me, listen to a samples of the songs before you buy it and you won't be dissapointed.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  Madonna manages once again to put something out that sounds so good and refreshing.  I have been a fan for 25 years and she still amazes me with her music.  Hard Candy is a must have album.  Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed.  Hoe-Zay wif a Z.
0141439807|4.0|I just finished this novel after having read Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion. It took me a while to get pulled into this novel because I really was not expecting that much from reading other opinions. Slowly I became absorbed by the personality of Fanny. She was doing an incredible job of turning Fanny gradually toward Henry Crawford and you were starting to like him when all of a sudden it was like she just got tired of the story and decided to contrive an ending.  It did not fit into the ending she was developing. Edmund was starting to look like milk toast and Crawford and Fanny's relationship was starting to warm up. I think it was by far her best writing but how disappointing an ending. Someone should rewrite it.
1582701709|1.0|Is getting people (myself included!) to pay for this! haha  There is some truth to positive thinking and changing your outlook on life.  This book claims however, if bad things happen to you it's because you in some way brought them upon yourself with the way you think.  If you're overweight...you didn't think hard enough to be thin.  If you have cancer...you didn't think hard enough about being healthy.  And on and on...    Perfect for anyone who feels entitled, but for the rest of us that work for our goals, you should pass.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I have seen all episodes and highly recommend them to everyone who thinks they learn all they needed to know in History Class. This was so much richer in story and facts.  Living in the general area I will definitely do some touring this summer. I loved President Adams conviction in liberty and freedom and the right for all people to have it.  Also his lack of slaves was a very surprising fact.  I also researched as I watched the series and learned so much more than I expected, I will be ordering the DVD'S and getting the book. I wish more meaningful series like this was on TV.  This needs to be shown on regular TV for all people to see.  Thanks to Mr. McCullough for writing this book and the producers for having the vision to make this series.

B000MV8AE0|4.0|Every good myth starts with a foundation of fact and some vastly powerful being or beings - in this case, Beethoven fills both roles. Then the mythmaker adds some fictional elements to set the story in motion - here, Anna Holtz does the job. Finally, the story requires drama. Could anything be more dramatic than the birth of Beethoven's sublime Ninth Symphony? Throw in some very fine actors, including Ed Harris in the title role (he also starrd in [[ASIN:B00005KHJJ Pollock]]), and a good movie becomes almost unavoidable.<br /><br />Anna enters the scene as an eager student, the best of her composition intructor's recent crop. Her job, as copyist, is to take the maestro's rough notes (musical nots, in this case), and transcribe them into final form. In this story, she's no mere scribe, but Beethoven's partner and intellectual soul-mate. You could call this a romance story of the most chaste and intellectual kind, but intimate nonetheless.<br /><br />Beethoven comes across as fiercely driven, fiercely egotistical, and just plain fierce. Holtz's delicate beauty tames that \\"beast\\", as he was termed early on. That feat came about more through her own strength and artistic skill than through her comeliness, though. I enjoyed seeing the fictional Holtz in a strong role, as improbable as it might historically have been. If you don't mind Beethoven the man being co-opted into a fictional setting that rewrites a few of his historical facts, this movie offers plenty to enjoy.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0790729725|3.0|Goodfellas is a good movie, destined to stamp its mark on the modern age. It is a sort of ersatz Godfather - tighter, easier, more accessible than the great Coppola Trilogy (or rather, parts I and II). Scorsese uses a fast paced, dialogue heavy, boiler plated filmic style to tell the story (based on the true one) of mob informer Henry Hill. Perhaps because he uses a real story as his base, it has an oddly lopsided narrative structure - the film ascends to a nasty and brilliant climax two thirds of the way through, culminating in the famous 'Layla' scene - the Jim Gordon piano the musical background to a number of 'whacked' bodies turning up all over town. But by the end the pace has fizzled a little, and the last third is fairly thin fare given the explosive might of what has gone before.<br /><br />The film is gangster lite - the customs, routines, tropes, jargon are explained frequently by a rather intrusive voiceover. None of the dark roiling of the great gangster films - brutal killings with no explanation. Still, it is a great cast and the movie is brilliantly filmed. Liotta looks a little overwhelmed at the role he has landed, but De Niro is sublime, and Lorraine Bracco is beautiful, brash and vulnerable as Hill's no nonsense Jewish wife from the five towns.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I love the slight hip-hop flavor to these songs! The hip-hop isn't enough to turn anyone off to the music, even if they don't care for hip-hop, but it is enough to give a new edge to her music. I love just about every song, and the thing that is neat about so much of Madonna's stuff, is that in many tracks I can hear tones of her voice that remind me of the really old stuff that I remember from when I was in middle school, and yet the overall feel is still really modern and new.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to buy this. I think the tracks are interesting enough to have a lot of staying power. They are smooth, have unexpected lyrics, and have a great beat.

Some of these Zeppelin gems one can never grow tired of are \\"Communication Breakdown\\", the sappy \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\", one of my personal Zeppelin favorites of all time \\"Ramble On\\", \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" (I have personal memories of this track - some years ago in my home town, we were having some major flooding - entire trailer parks were being evacuated, etc. - some wide-mouth afternoon DJ played this song several time, obviously outraged several listeners - believe he only received a slap on the wrist for his prank) and the beautifully played \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\". The DVD simply has too many out-standing tunes to list here. Some I know I've seen on other Zep compilations. Recommended.
1400031001|2.0|I suspect my expectations are the problem here... because so many others seem to like this novel.  But having read, and thoroughly enjoyed Boyd's \\"Restless,\\"  and reading the good reviews on \\"Any Human Heart,\\" I purchased the psuedo- autobiography hoping to be equally enthralled.  I found the format too choppy, and the more I learned about the main character, the less I cared about him and his future entries.  So many historic names are dropped, and then the story lines involving them are also dropped, leaving the reader in limbo.  Finally, about three-quarters of the way through this novel I started skimming ahead, learned how he died and finally, laid this novel to rest.  I plan to try one of Boyd's other novels in hopes of finding another read as compelling as \\"Restless.\\"
B000PHX8C0|5.0|Holy sh**! Title of this third Devil Driver CD should have been 'Kiss Your Lilly White *ss Goodbye'. Didn't realize at first that when I saw DD open for Dimmu Borgir a year ago that this was the band that featured former Coal Chamber frontman Dez Fafara. I mean, this disc is freaking H-E-A-V-Y! Know what I'm saying? Tracks that's sure to rob of your hearing possibly for the next day or two are \\"Not All Who Wander Are Lost\\", the in-your-face \\"Horn Of Betrayal\\", \\"Burning Sermon\\" and \\"Tirades Of Truth\\". Just caught Devil Driver touring the club circuit on their current U.S. trek and I would highly recommend their live show to any fan of 100% pure metal. Fans of Daath, Lamb Of God, Children Of Bodom, Otep and the previously mentioned Dimmu Borgir should undoubtedly get plenty from 'Last Kind Words'. A must-have.
B00006J3WH|4.0|Joss Whedon is a genious and this cd is wonderfull to have(ie. to get to have a bit of buffy in the car). But get the episode first because after listening to the cd we just had to watch the episode again. Most of the  songs just work so much better with the visuals.
B00003CX9S|5.0|Certainly one of Lynch's most commercially accessible films.  Beautiful to look at, compelling story -- Lynch at his focused, reigned-in-a-bit best.
B00099BRUO|5.0|Hands down the best Manowar album. The culmination of all of there albums. I own them all. Powerful, melodic, and fast when it needs to be. Buy the special edition, it comes with one more awesome song.
B00138KHAQ|5.0|What can I say ?<br />It's like getting two albums in one.<br />\\"It takes a lot to laugh...\\" best song. How do you get from Dylan to Steven Stills to Little Feat? Answer.. see above.<br />Albert's Shuffle, best blues number. Tribute to Albert King.<br />\\"His Holy Modal Majesty\\" best acid fade to jazz. No, it's not from \\"Easy Rider\\". Get the first Blood Sweat & Tears album for more Al Kooper.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|Its true to its promise of being a decent mixer for the money. I use mine for podcasting and so far i've found it to be very useful. I do have something i must warn everyone about.. Its not a huge deal.. but its certainly an annoyance. There is NO POWER BUTTON!!! I honestly just turn down the main mix all the way to -00 and leave it turned on which does the trick, but i'd really prefer to be able to just switch it off at night instead of going under my desk and unplug it. Currently i'm using a Sennheiser e835 with this and it sounds amazing! Honestly to a friend, i recommend both. Enjoy!
B0000009OP|5.0|I first heard this in a wine store in Tucson, Arizona six months after Mark had died.  It was a few minutes before closing on a Friday night and the then manager, Andy, who is a musician, had taken off the Frank Sinatra after the bosses left and put on Cure for the Pain.  I immediately had to know what the music was.  He had seen Morphine live and told me about Mark's death.  Within the next week I bought this album and then all the other albums. The Night is my favorite and totally hooked me.  For the past five years I have been researching Mark's biography and let me tell you, you have no idea.  The guy was cooler than cool and led the most incredible life.  Its such a beautiful sad story. Just like the music.  One thing that most people don't get is that a lot of the songs have a second meaning - for example \\"I had my chance\\" is really about trying to make a left turn in L.A. \\"Let's take a trip\\" - think Owsley and 1965.  He had a great sense of humor.  If you are a true Morphine fan, get yourself hooked up with some live concert bootlegs.  His patter is great, as is the poetry he sometimes inserted into a show. The albums were a sort of static rendition of the live Morphine. He had a band with Chris Ballew (before Chris formed The Presidents of the United States of America) in Cambrige that was called Supergroup and they made everything up on the spot.  Before the show they would have a beer and come up with song titles and then invent the songs on stage before a live audience at the Plough & Stars. Oh and also, number one misunderstanding, the name Morphine comes from Morpheus the god of dreams not the drug. Its a play on Sandman's name and that ditty, \\"Mister Sandman, bring me a dream...\\"  First you come up with the name.  Then you get the beat of the day....
B0012E6R3W|3.0|I love Testament and I had been waiting for this album for couple of years.   I have listened to to this cd for 3-4 times in order not to make a rush comment but I can honestly say that this one among their weakest albums.Sorry for that, but the whole album is just like a \\"one big song\\" which has been cut into 8-9 pieces.Even the great Scolnick guitar solos are no so tasty.Listen to it, you'll see what I mean.1 of 3 stars goes for the great sound and production,  2 for the songs..
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Where do I begin?  This movie has it all!  Clever dialogue, cool plot, lots of humor, touching emotional scenes, romance, and of course- ZOMBIES!!!!<br /><br />Shaun is your average Joe working for a living, living in a flat with his two roomates, trying to keep his relationship with his girlfriend together, and visit his Mum every once in a while.  Oh- and make regular visits to the local pub.<br /><br />His humdrum life is interrupted with a sudden surge of zombies in the neighborhood, and our average bloke must step up and become a hero.<br />What I really loved about this movie is that things were done that I have never seen in a zombie movie before- i.e. when Shaun and the gang figure a way to walk through a crowd of zombies without calling attention to themselves, and what becomes of the zombies when the story is over.<br /><br />To really enjoy and appreciate the phenomena that is Shaun of the Dead, you should watch it 4 or 5 times, to truly grasp all of the nuances that you may miss because you are hiding behind your pillow or laughing too hard.<br /><br />P.S.: You've got red on you!
0151008116|5.0|I picked up this book completely on a whim for a 7 hour plane ride back from Italy. I had been told good things that about it, but I hate when people recommend books to me. But I was desperate in a German airport. I did not put the book down the entire flight and continued reading the book when I got home. Life of Pi was an amazing book filled with emotion and adventure. I finished the book and just felt a sense of astonishment. I did not want the book to end, but I am glad I was able to take away what I wanted from the book and I did not feel that Martel shoved his point down the reader's throat. I'm obnoxious and recommend this book to anyone who asks for a suggestion. I am looking forward to rereading this book whenever I get my copy back from a friend I loaned it to.    I absolutely loved this novel and recommend it without any hesitations.
B0017U7PT6|5.0|I saw this film in theaters on the opening day. It was amazing: the special effects were great and the storyline was coool! There were some immitations in the movie with the contrast of 300, which made me mad! Rolland Emmerich is one of the best directors!! \\"Pure and Exciting!\\"
B00005JPS7|5.0|I saw Iron Man. I loved it.<br /><br />Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., owns a weapons manufacturer. On a trip to demonstrate a new missile, the Jericho, which knocks out a wall of defenses with many small bombs deployed from a single shot, he is captured. His captors are essentially killers Al-Qaeda. They want him to build this device.<br /><br />In a cave, he realizes he cannot escape on his own. He'll build the bomb, and then, they'll kill him. Bad deal. He secretly builds the Iron Man suit and gets back home. Fellow captive and engineering genius Dr. Yinsen cautions him, \\"Don't waste your life.\\" Yinsen gives his life to save Tony's.<br /><br />While in captivity, he sees that his weapons are used by the enemy. Why? How?<br /><br />He had been a sleazy, rich, indulgent womanizer. Now, he sees the light. Not only is he a new man with his morals, but, with his view about weapons. His Iron Man suit will be used for good, by him. Specifically, he will use it to take down the enemy's stock of Stark Industry weapons.<br /><br />One problem. His partner, Obadiah Stane, is in cahoots with the enemy. He sanctioned Stark's capture, and is the one selling Stark products. He double crosses the enemy, and acquires the Iron Man prototype suit and plans.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), previously seen as a plain assistant, starts looking good to Tony Starks. Both realize they are nowhere without the other.<br /><br />What now?<br /><br />Go see it. Surprise ending.<br /><br />When you do, look for Stan Lee. He's the Hugh Hefner lookalike.<br /><br />The acting is solid, with Downey spot-on for the role. Paltrow is replaceable. Jeff Bridges, as Obadiah, is excellently cast. Shaun Toub as Dr. Yinsen carries the role impressively, though we only see him in the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />Terrence Howard as Lt. Colonel James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes is the weakest link, as he comes across too feminine and insipid to be the kind of leader he should be as the liaison between Stark Industries and the military.<br /><br />The movie's messages: heroes are men who do the right thing even if it means sacrifice, and, bigger guns do not necessarily lead to peace. The message is conflicted, however, as it is bigger guns which save the day (with some good ol' experience thrown in).<br /><br />The idea of not wasting one's life -- having purpose and vision -- comes through well. This brings the movie from sheer pulp to something with depth. Tony Stark is not perfect; some of his faults are indefensible. He is, though, a man on a mission.

B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|\\"Next\\" is an action film built on an intriguing sci-fi concept. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Cris Johnson, a Las Vegas \\"magician\\" who can see the future. Actually, he can see only two minutes into the future, but his uncanny ability would be still useful for some people, like an FBI agent played by Julianne Moore, chasing a group of terrorists who have smuggled a nuclear bomb into America.    Yes, the film's story is implausible, full of plot holes and sometimes the \\"two-minutes-into-the-future\\" idea seems totally forgotten, but once action gets started, the film is entertaining. I really enjoyed watching Cage's hero evading dangers, running (or walking) away from guards hiding behind objects in a casino, or dodging numerous objects flying and falling (including a bullet) in the cliffside scene. One humorous scene has him trying to talk to his love interest, a beautiful teacher named Liz (played by Jessica Biel) that reminds us of \\"Groundhog Day.\\"    Unfortunately, Cris' romance turns out one of the weakest parts of the film. The heroine is too generic to make the love story interesting and though Nicolas Cage's character remains likeable and watchable, most characters in \\"Next\\" are colorless or given too short time to shine like Peter Falk's. We are not allowed to know even the motives or backgrounds of the terrorists. Special effects are not very impressive and some of them look hurriedly done.    While watching the film, I was wondering: \\"Why didn't they use Julianne Moore's no-nonsense FBI agent as Cage's possible love interest, who is definitely a more interesting character than Biel's. You know this is not a masterpiece, but you will also find this film could have been much better, more thrilling with minor changes. Perhaps that is why some people (including me) didn't like the ending, which looks a bit abrupt.    I'm not saying \\"Next\\" is a terrible film (especially after seeing \\"The Wicker Man,\\" which it is.) But the film still needs more actions, more chemistry between Cage and Biel, and most of all, like \\"Ghost Rider,\\" more original ways to make use of the hero's unique abilities.
B0015KO52S|5.0|There really isn't anything that I can add to all the superb reviews I have read today.  I am a fan of Jack White, and The White Stripes, and the first Raconteurs album \\"Broken Boy Soldier\\" took a few times of listening through it  before it grew on me.  It became one of my favorites, and I didn't know what to expect with Consolers of the Lonely.  After listening to it many times, I can honestly say there isn't one song on this album that I don't love.  It's a classic- I think it's genius.  And it's true what they say about The Raconteurs putting on an unbelievably awesome live show.  We just saw them on the 28th, and they rocked the house down!  I have seen many performers in my lifetime, and I can honestly say this is THE BEST concert I have attended.  If you get a chance to see them live, don't pass it up, you won't regret it!!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I admit, when this album first came out, I was a bit disappointed, but now that it's had this time to familiarize itself to me I think it's one of the greatest albums that's every been released in my lifetime.  AFI is past just being a great band.  This album has made them into legends in their own time.  It's 5 years now since they've made it big, and it's still weird for me.  Davey used to live around here where I live, and he was not a person I would have ever picked out as someone that was going to be famous.  Nonetheless, though, he's done quite an impressive array for himself.
B000P12LWY|3.0|More than enough has been said about the many historical inaccuracies of this production. That and the tediousness of the sex scenes made me lose much of the interest I initially had in \\"The Tudors\\".   I watched it out of curiousity at first. Intriguing scenes included the meeting of the French and English King on the Field of the Cloth of Gold, and the recitals of historically accurate dialogue.   While a fine actor, it's hard to accept Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII, even as a young Henry. An actor the caliber of Russell Crowe, Brendan Gleeson, or even the series' own Rod Malley, who plays Richard Rich, would have been more believable. Rhys Meyers' lack of resemblance to Bluff King Hal makes me yearn for the performances of Charles Laughton, Keith Mitchell, or even Richard Burton.   While appropriately pert, Natalie Dormer, no less a fine actress, lacks certain physical attributes of Anne Boleyn. The doomed Queen's best portrayal was by Genevieve Bujold in \\"Anne of the Thousand Days\\".   My view of Maria Doyle Kennedy's Catherine of Aragon is the same. Her performance is reminiscent of Irene Papas' in \\"Anne of the Thousand Days\\",and while capturing the piety, dolefulness and resolve of the spurned Queen, Annette Crosbie bore a stronger physical resemblance when portraying her in the 1972 miniseries, \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\".   I can tolerate Nick Dunning as the dubious Thomas Boleyn. He is a little less vacillating than Michael Hordern in \\"Anne of the Thousand Days\\". But John Collicos' interpretation of Thomas Cromwell was more formidable in the aforementioned film than James Frain's in this production. Wolfe Morris, who had the same role in \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\", outshines them both, bearing a closer physical resemblance to the scheming lawyer.   Most recently, I viewed  Episode 5 of Season 2, which features less nudity, and more drama and intrigue.   Peter O'Toole, is as usual, terrific as Pope Paul III, who empathizes with Catherine's plight.But the real standout performance that, indeed, is one of the show's saving graces is that of Jeremy Northam's understatedly outstanding role of Sir Thomas More.   With the recent passing of two of the Catholic Saint's more noted portrayers, Paul Scofield, and Charlton Heston, there is a certain profundity in watching Northam inhibit the part with his own sense of dramatic timing. One redeeming quality of the series is that it allows a lenghthier portrayal of certain facets of the lives of the main characters, and there is something commendable about seeing More as a warm, loving, and pious husband, father, and professional.   By Episode 5 of Season 2, we've seen his children grow up, and join their stepmother, Alice, (Catherine Byrne) in begging the incarcerated More to take the Oath of Allegience to The King as the Supreme Head of the Church, which More, like Bishop Fisher(Bosco Hogan in another great performance) refuses to do. More's Latin prayers are recited with intense fervor; the staidness and humility that turn to fire during the trial for his life are also valiantly displayed.    This is the performance by Northam that really made me take note of him, and through his efforts, we feel that the moral courage of the blessed Chancellor will be felt for all seasons and for all time.   I trust that Northam's Emmy is being welded right about now. It would be a travesty if this is not so.
B000NA28I4|1.0|I was so totally excited when the movie came out, but I was bitterly disappointed.   - They totally messed up the plot line.  - What's with those stupid leather pants?  - Whatever happened to Murtagh's character? It was so much more complex than that.  - Dragons do not go from being a baby to full grown in like, five seconds.  - What about Roran and Katrina?  - Tronjeim was disappointing.  - What happened to Orik?  - Everybody's hair color was wrong.  - The only thing I liked was maybe their choice of Durza and Galbatorix. That's it.
0385333846|5.0|One of the first 'science fiction' books I ever read. Really whet my appetite for the genre. Vonnegut does not sacrifice character development for quirks of plot. Surprisingly easy to follow, despite all the jumping about in time.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|Long story short, had this album since 2005, never really listened to it, bought \\"E=MC2\\", decided to but the Platinum edition of \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" and I LOVE IT.<br />Key tracks:<br />It's Like That - such a up beat way to reintroduce herself and let go all of the pain from the few years before.<br />We Belong Together - one of my favourite songs of ALL TIME, I love it. Everything about this r&b song is perfection to me. The vocals, running time, chorus, music. I love it toooo much.<br />Shake it Off - nice song, not the best but its pretty cool!<br />Say Somethin' - really mid-90's sounding, I really like this track.<br />Get your Number - another grower on me, its a really hot song, the video is awesome too.<br />One And Only - Mariahs restrained vocals sound awesome and Twistas rapping is top notch.<br />Fly Like A Bird - WOW. Perfect gospel up lifting song!<br />Dont Forget About Us - Kind of a carbon copy of We Belong Together but its a decent enough track and well deserving of her 17th #1.<br />We Belong Together REMIX - kind of repetitive, but nevertheless, a really good track!<br /><br />SO BUY THIS NOW! Along with E=MC2, Mariah has made 2 REALLY good albums over the past 3 years! Too good! Try it out now! Go on!

B0011NVCO8|3.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATER. I REALLY WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE HD DVD.    TO MAKE THIS QUICK I WILL ONLY HIT A FEW POINTS.    THE FILM ITSELF WAS VERY ENTERTAINING. THE VIDEO ON THE HD DVD WAS FAR LESS THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARED TO OTHER HD DVD TITLES THAT I OWN, AND THE AUDIO WAS NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT.    IF YOU WANT TO PURCHASE THIS FILM, TRY TO GET IT AS A STAND ALONE DVD TITLE AND SAVE SOME CASH.
B00005R8FI|3.0|The band on this CD is great. I saw them live when they toured promoting this CD. My problem with this recording is that Mayall is an especially lame vocalist. I also agree with the reviewer who said that the lyrics were weak. Mayall has a great ear for talent, its too bad the didn't use that ear to hire a vocalist. In spite of the lyrics, I like most of the songs; although, \\"Room to Move\\" is all flash and no substance. It's showy and fun (especially live), but the harp playing is really nothing to write home about and the song is just a recycled \\"Tequila\\" riff played over and over again.
B0013FBS20|4.0|I AM SUBMITTING THIS AS A REVIEW OF THE BLU-RAY VERSION OF THE MOVIE.     I SAW THIS FILM IN THE THEATER AND WAS JUST AS HACKED OFF ABOUT THE END AS EVERYONE ELSE. THAT IS WHY I STOPPED AT FOUR STARS.     NOW TO THE BLU-RAY DISC. THERE IS AN ALTERNATE ENDING THAT I LIKED MUCH BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL, BUT I WILL LEAVE OUT THE DETAILS.     THE GREAT THING ON THIS DISC IS THAT THE VIDEO IS JUST PERFECT. I THINK IT LOOKS BETTER HERE THAN AT THE THEATER. ALSO, THE TRUEHD SOUNDTRACK IS AWESOME. I HAVE CRANKED UP THE FIRST SCENE IN THE MUSTANG SEVERAL TIMES JUST TO LET FRIENDS AND FAMILY SEE WHAT HOME THEATER IS SUPPOSED TO BE.    THIS IS A VERY ENJOYABLE FILM THAT IS MADE EVEN BETTER WITH TOP SHELF AUDIO AND VIDEO ON THE HD FORMATS.
B000X5KSWM|4.0|There is inevitably going to be comparisons with this and with \\"Dark Passion Play\\" Nightwish's new album that has also been released recently. People are going to be acrimonious and be either \\"for\\" or \\"against\\" and will likewise spam both albums with their viewpoint.<br /><br />This will not be one of those reviews. I am both a fan of Nightwish, and a fan of Tarja. Each album deserves the respect of being judged on its own merits, and not on the merits of what \\"could have been\\".<br /><br />That being said, I find this to be a decent attempt at Tarja establishing herself. She has had one previous album, but was still with Nightwish at the time. Now that she has not that protective failsafe, I find her caution with certain things understandable. This album offers a little to the rockers with some of the heavier songs, and the bombastic like deliveries of music. It also offers the crooning ballads. It tries to be many things to give many people a little of what she thinks they want.<br /><br />It is VERY clear that her self-pride is intact. Her defiance seeths in \\"I walk alone\\", and casting herself as the phoenix that burns those that come near while she draws them in is classic Diva.<br /><br />Ultimately this album is about Tarja showcasing her lovely voice. On that she delivers.<br /><br />I allow myself this small comparison to Nightwish, because I feel it germane...the lyrics on this album are not very subtle. Tarja never strikes me as a subtle person, but I do rather miss the multi-layered and poetic lyricism of Tuomos to place her voice against. It is my hope in future albums she will become more comfortable and willing to expand into challenging material.<br /><br />All in all, this was a competent, satisfying and safe debut as a totally single artist.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|THIS IS THE ONLY BATMAN FILM I HAVE EVER REALLY CARED FOR, BUT BOY DID I LIKE THIS ONE!!!    THIS FILM WAS EXCELLENT IN MY EYES, AND BETTER STILL, THE HD DVD WAS OUTSTANDING.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Ever the chameleon, Madonna has a unique ability to shift and change her sound without ever losing her individual integrity as an artist. Hard Candy proves to be no exception to this rule. She has masterfully injected an R&B feel into what surely will be remembered as one of the best dance pop albums of all time. It's difficult to pinpoint standout tracks in such a well produced album. So, perhaps it would be easier for me to pinpoint my least favorite, which seems to be one of everybody else's favorites: She's Not Me. It's the one track that doesn't seem to fit in.
B000K7UBTI|3.0|Billionaire playboy Tony Stark is critically injured and taken prisoner by a Chinese cult determined to reverse his unearthing of an ancient city prophesied to bring about the return of the dreaded Mandarin. With the help of his best friend, Rhodey, his damaged heart is made functional again, so to speak, and he creates a suit of armor that is a technological wonder. Later, pursued by the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for selling weapons to the Chinese radicals, he secretly becomes the superhero Iron Man in order to stop the rise of Mandarin by destroying his four elemental demons before they can retrieve the five rings that will make him whole again. But Tony is also fighting to help a confused young woman named Li Mei who is caught up in the struggle.<br /><br />From Marvel Comics and Lionsgate, \\"The Invincible Iron Man\\" is another direct-to-DVD film in Marvel's new line of animated features, this one conveniently preceding a new live-action film starring Robert Downey, Jr. which comes out tomorrow (as I write this review). Both Marvel and DC have gotten into the direct-to-video animated features arena, and for many fans of their classic characters this is a great thing. Of course, modernizing these beloved characters and stories and recreating them a bit for a new, wider audience doesn't sit too well with some of the diehard comic fans (who should really watch Mark Hamill's \\"Comic Book: The Movie\\" if they haven't already) that are set in their ways about how they feel these characters must be portrayed. To a certain degree, this is understandable, but then you have the folks who gripe about every little change and update. Anyway, another problem had, particularly with animated features here in the States, is this desire to cater to a more adult audience, but at the same time, the notion that animated features must be targeted to kids too (Fact is, here in the States there are still a lot of dummies who think that if it's animated or comic book related, it should be totally aimed at kids and adults should have no interest in it). There is a difficulty in figuring out how to make something that is in that middle area for action and violence oriented subject matter, largely because kid material nowadays is expected to be so unthreatening and cheeseball. And this film, like so many other American animated features meant to be edgy the way so much Anime is, suffers from that problem a bit. Though the plot has some adult angles to it (which sometimes feel rather forced), the whole \\"get the rings before the bad guys do\\" has a sort of kiddie Anime feel to it (even though I admit they do that sort of thing on Smallville all the time), and the lack of explanation of Tony Stark's anti-gun attitude gives the impression that he just feels that way because he's a \\"good guy\\", and good guys have to be anti-gun. It's also a bit convenient that Tony has been developing his Iron Man project for years before the real \\"origin\\" in this film. Elements like this do make one feel they are watching a film aimed at kids. But then you have implied sex and a hostage being shot in the head in the same film, so it's all rather unbalanced. It seems the filmmakers wanted this movie to be for young adults, so I just wish they'd worked on the story and writing a bit more to be more consistent with that idea. I also was bothered that a lot of this film's take on Stark gives me various Batman flashbacks, including boardroom scenes that feel they are right out of \\"Batman Begins\\" (my favorite superhero movie, by the way). Still, overall, this is a decent superhero film. I don't think folks who are new to the story of Iron Man will have much to complain about except that maybe it drags a bit. In other words, there could/should be a lot more Iron Man action. It's a bit slow to get going and the characters could be a bit less wooden. To me, DC still holds the crown when it comes to animation, and they have since the fantastic Batman the Animated Series of the '90's. As for the animation of \\"The Invincible Iron Man,\\" it has good moments and bad moments, but the integration of CGI is excellent and used on just the right things (I've long wanted to see some Star Wars animated films with a 2D/CGI mix along these lines, and we sorta got that with the Clone Wars, though I was more interested in post-Jedi stuff, but now they are going to go entirely with goofy looking CGI). I thought the music here was pretty good most of the time, as was the voice acting, but the characters could have been more likable and the plot a bit more involving and less condescending. It was pretty good nevertheless, but I have a feeling the bigscreen, live-action film is going to be much better. This is one worth owning if you are an animation, superhero, or Iron Man fanatic, but it's not likely to blow you away, and clearly many comic fans had a problem with the villain, Mandarin, only appearing for the final battle and only in a spirit form inhabiting one of the characters.<br /><br />The DVD is decent in the extras department, by the way. It gives us the Origin of Iron Man featurette (which is a making-of program), a great informational gallery of Iron Man's various suits of armor, a concept art show, and a pretty cool alternate opening sequence. There is also quite a lengthy look at the opening of the new \\"Doctor Strange\\" animated feature. If you like this one, you'll surely want to pick up Ultimate Avengers and Ultimate Avengers 2, plus that new Doctor Strange flick, which I haven't seen but looks to have even better visuals than the previous titles. I also highly recommend Superman: Doomsday and Justice League: The New Frontier, not to mention the upcoming Batman: Gotham Knight (though be forewarned, that one is real Anime).nimation of \\"The Invincible Iron Man,\\" it has good moments and bad moments, but the integration of CGI is excellent and used on just the right things (I've long wanted to see some Star Wars animated films with a 2D/CGI mix along these lines, and we sorta got that with the Clone Wars, though I was more interested in post-Jedi stuff, but now they are going to go entirely with goofy looking CGI).

B0013D8LOU|5.0|Burton/Depp have done it again! Now I have never seen the broadway show, but I have the soundtrack to it, and Depp does a good job. So does Helena Bonham Carter. But Burton is a movie genius and got the gothic/dark/macbre feeling down pretty well. From what I have seen of the show, it seems Burton has hit the nail right on the head. The blood is comical at times, yet still amazing and just adds to the movie's dark essence. Great film by Burton, and great job from Depp working with Burton
B000BT97AO|5.0|i was very happy to find the mirror mask dvd here.. and so cheap! i know i'll purchase future dvds from amazon again!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|This is one of the funniest, most enjoyable movies ever made..period.  All of the Coen's work is great but this has got to be the best.  Each time it is watched I enjoy it even more than the time before and everything about it is truly genius.  Without exaggerating, there is subtle humour in every single frame and there are so many quotable lines to remember.  The casting and acting is perfect and the characters could not have been done better.  Anyone who says that they do not like this movie or think it is funny is either an idiot, lying or unable to have an open mind.  I can watch this any time, any place and with anyone.  It must be owned, it's that simple.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|this is not her best album, but it is definitely not her worst. this one is a combination of bedtime stories and confessions. a couple of cool songs. i enjoy 4 minutes (not a timberlake fu\an, but liked it anyway), give it 2 me, heartbeat and incredible. i love madonna...been a fan since 1983 when i was 13. this album has grownon me in the past two days. if you are a madonna fan this is obviously a must have. if youre not already fan im not sure if i would select this for you to get to know her...i would pick like a virgin, ray of light and confessions.     UPDATED 05/18/08  after a couple of weeks of listening to this cd i have grown to love it. i listen to it every day. this is her best since ray of light.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This version of Persuasion was absolutely incredible!!  I enjoyed every minute and have watched it many times.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I'm not gonna get in depth... just that it's a great album and that Madonna BARELY EVER disappoints.  I had my reservations regarding this project, but I'm pleased to say my expectations have been way exceeded.  Way to go, Lady M.  You've done it again!
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|Madonna has always amazed us by picking little-known or boundary-pushing producers and collaborators.  What she gives us here is the middle finger -- an \\"f-you\\" to her record label, and to her fans.     Buying tracks from has-been producers and writing ridiculously trite lyrics is NOT the Madonna I knew and loved.  Where was this album before Britney, Nelly Furtado, et. al. jumped on the Timbaland and Neptunes bandwagons??    Boo.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I simply love this soundtrack.It is the most romantic music to the most romantic scene in a touching film.The emotion and sensibility is probable!<br />Dawn, A postcard to Henry Purcell,Liz on top the world, Leaving Netherfield,Darcy's Letter,Your hands are cold and Mrs.Darcy are my favorite songs!<br />Beautiful moving inspiring beautiful classical music performed by an excellent pianist.<br />I love this music.It's really reflects the feelings in the movie, which by the way is my favorite movie ,performed by my favorite actor Matthew Macfadyen.
B0011HOEYY|5.0|I'm going to be brief.  The movie was great.  It had it's dry spells but Denzel was on point.  He's a great actor, but when he plays a bad a$$ he's at his finest.  He'll probably win another Oscar for his role.  There is speculation that the story was twisted and not totally true.  Who cares.  The story was great.  It had me engaged and the action was intense.  If you like Scarface or Goodfellas you'll like this kind of movie.
B000U7169M|4.0|I just got finished watching this movie.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, if your a fan of Horrir movies, then this movie is right up there on the list of ones to see.  I believe there going to be making a second film, judging by the way it ended.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I didn't rate this low because I disliked the controller.  I did it because there is nothing new here.  It's pratically the same controller that was made for the PS2 but cordless.  Nothing wrong with that but I did expect more rumble from it.  The controller feels just like the old, standard controller with a little more weight (for obvious reasons).  If you insist on the rumble function do not hesitate to buy otherwise, I would just game with your old controller.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I am not going to create a track by track review, but my review is about the album as a whole.  I wasn't too sure if I could deal with a \\"Hip Hop\\" album.  But after hearing some of the tracks before purchasing the cd.  I was really digging it, this is a top notch album from the only woman in pop music that dares to be different.  This album does have influences of hip hop, techco, pop and r&b, but it is undeniably a true Madonna album.  Fun, sexy, and in your face dance music.  Bravo to Madonna again for never let her fans down or for that matter pop music.
B000YENUI6|3.0|I really thought this movie would have been better.  It had a good storyline attached to it but I expected more action and I definately didn't expect such a lame ending.  I wouldn't have minded the lack of action if there was a much better ending.  I would rent before I buy.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|What a great story.  What a great, and complex, character!  What a great actor (Michael C Hall)...<br /><br />This show has been the best thing to hit HBO/SHO since SFU and SATC for me.  Michael C Hall's portrayal of the character Dexter is brilliant, chilling, and fascinating.  You immediately are on his side and enamored with this character.<br /><br />The other characters, many with intense backstories of their own, have been equally fascinating and complex, but the brilliance of the main character is something that should not be missed by anybody who is a fan of the psychological thriller.<br /><br />Season one is a must see for anybody who is coming into the series late.  You really must start from the beginning as the backstory starts right in and slowly develops throughout the first two seasons.  I'm sure there will be more surprises in season three and beyond.

B000N4SHPS|5.0|Sylvester Stallone has always been underrated by many, but his characterizations of Rocky Balboa and John Rambo will outlive him and the rest of us. Sure, there were failures in the series, but the originals were classic.<br /><br />  With \\"Rocky Balboa\\", Stallone acknowledges saying goodbye to the character he created thirty years earlier. And it is a fine, heart-tugging send off. I doubt, though, that it will work for anyone who hasn't seen the original \\"Rocky\\", because the main movie figures so prominently.<br /><br />  Rocky is long past his prime. His beloved Adrian died of \\"woman's cancer\\" a few years ago and Rocky pines for her every day. Stallone's script is particularly touching in this regard as Rocky visits the cemetery where he has a folding chair stashed, so he can sit and visit graveside with Adrian. Pauly, Adrian's obnoxious brother, is still around, obnoxiously played by Burt Young who seems born to the role.<br /><br />  Rocky's life is empty. Yes, he has what appears to be a successful restaurant, named \\"Adrian's\\", where like many sports celebrities before him, he regales patrons with stories of his glory days. His son, unconvincingly portrayed by someone whose name I've forgotten, is embarassed by his father's fame and is trying to just make his own way in the business world.  Rocky visits the old neighborhood and is dismayed to see that things are changing, decaying really, getting old just like the Rock.<br /><br />  Rocky finds a shy romantic interest in the grown-up girl who sassed him in the first \\"Rocky\\".<br /><br />  But the real story involves Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon, the reigning heavyweight champion who has an image problem: people think that he has acheived his title not because of his boxing skills, but because his slick promoters line up weak opponents. A local sports show has an ongoing debate over whether Rocky in his prime could have beaten Mason Dixon. Yes, they say and they have a computerized animation to prove it.<br /><br />  This sparks the idea of an \\"exhibition\\" match between the young Dixon and the aging Rocky. The spectacle of 60 year old Rocky Balboa training to fight the youthful Dixon becomes the meat of the movie and is, frankly, moving, recalling the original \\"Rocky\\". (Seeing the againg Stallone's over-muscled physique, however, borders on the grotesque.)<br /><br />  The culmination is the fight between the two - and it is beautifully choreographed.<br /><br />  In the end, \\"Rocky Balboa\\" echos all the human qualities that made the original \\"Rocky\\" so appealing. The battle of the underdog doesn't lose its appeal, especially in Stallone's very talented hands.<br /><br />Jerryetween the young Dixon and the aging Rocky.

B00006H67C|5.0|If you're not  a genuine free jazz fan (a freebie?) you might still enjoy the energy and relentless swing of these heated performances, that use the power of stereo better than many contemporary artists...<br />Although Coleman's album [[ASIN:B000002IIL Change of the Century]] seems to me more accesible - for instance, there is now the challenging stereo chaos and, well, it has more songs :-)  - this is still interesting even for us who prerer more conservative types of jazz...<br /><br />The assembley on the album is amazing - Eric Dolphy, Freddie Hubbard, Don Cherry and others really play exciting jazz.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I've been an out-spoken critic of this LP since it's release.  After many days of listening and hearing the other crap that's been released of late:  I find myself smiling,  crying and feeling better than I have since I realized GOD was a truth:<br /><br />This is a POP album.  It's perfection in pop.  The production is flavorful without burying Madonna's pretty voice.  I've loved this woman for years and this LP,  although initially horrid to my ears,  has grown on me.  So I must confess that I was wrong.  To any pop fan,  not just Madonna fan,  out there let me assure you:  buying this LP will make your existence better for it.
B00139W3NE|5.0|This movie is wonderful!  Of course, it isn't as good as the book, but that's always the case!
0345337581|5.0|This is an excellent book with so many effective, fun, and creative techniques to improving memorization of a huge variety of different types of information. This book has allowed me to memorize huge lists of items, long strings of random numbers, thousands of vocabulary words and definitions, and foreign language rules and vocabulary. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who is looking for effective, FUN techniques to improve memory! The writing is casual, and the book is an enjoyable read! This is one of my all-time favorite books.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Ever since Music, American Life, Confessions, etc... her liner notes and artwork leave me saying WHAT,THAT'S IT?!!!<br /><br />I always like to have the lyrics and artist info along with some different shots.  This one has the same pictures over and over and then leaves all the info jumbled up in the last two pages, hard to read and space is wasted.<br /><br />Also too much Justin.  While he can be fun sometimes (Sexyback, Damn Girl, My Love, 4 Minutes) he is way overrated and uses same beats over and over and I really don't like the whole I'm R&B thing and him thinking he's all that.  While he can play some instruments he is not anywhere near Prince or any other genius writer, performer, producer, etc...<br /><br />To me Madonna can do no wrong, I love all her music, even the bad ones and I collect them all.  The best songs are:<br /><br />  Candy shop (awesome, sexy, can be in the same album as lucky star or burning up)<br />  4 minutes (great horns and beat)<br />  Give it 2 me (fun, catchy)<br />  Heartbeat (good britney-ish)<br />  Beat Goes on (fun, cool beat)<br /><br />The so so's:<br /><br />  Miles Away (nice)<br />  Voices<br /><br />The horrible ones:<br /><br />  Dance 2night<br />  Incredible<br />  Devil wouldn't recognize you (Justin, ughh)<br />  Spanish lesson<br />  She's not me<br /><br />They should have left out one of the horrible ones above and added Ring My Bell.  The Japanese bonus track is very good.<br /><br />My favorite Madonna albums are:<br /><br />  #1 Ray of light (her masterpiece)<br />  #2 Like a Prayer (her masterpiece #2)<br />  #3 Erotica (her masterpiece #3)<br />  #4 American Life (her overlooked underrated masterpiece #4)<br /><br />Then, in this order:<br /><br />  Madonna<br />  Confessions on the dance floor<br />  True Blue<br />  Like a Virgin<br />  Hard Candy<br />  Immaculate collection (including Causing a commotion & who's that girl)<br />  Bedtime stories<br />  I'm Breathless<br />  Something to Remember/Evita<br />  Live CD's with DVD's of I'm going to tell & Confessions<br /><br />and lastly her worst but still good<br /><br />  Music<br /><br />Love you Madonna!!!od         Music    Love you Madonna!!!
B000GCFO0I|1.0|This was garbage a real waste of time, nothing shocking and thrilling about this movie just plain boring. The creature effect sucked the acting was dumb i mean why would you put one person doing the exploreing and there was not much killing, so this was a corney movie.
B000957O82|4.0|Alex Hitchens, \\"Hitch\\" to his friends (Will Smith), has a wonderful job.  He helps men get the women of their dreams by giving them dating tips and arranging situations where they can meet their current crushes.  Dubbed the \\"Date Doctor,\\" Hitch operates by word of mouth.<br /><br />His latest client is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), a nerdy accountant who is deeply in love with socialite Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta).  Even though Albert is way out of Allegra's league, Hitch begins to work his magic.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Hitch has met society columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is doing his best to win her.  Sara is a tough cookie to crack, however, because her job reporting the break ups of others has made her extremely cynical.  Sara's pursuit of Allegra and Albert only makes things worse.  Will anyone find true love?<br /><br />I'm sure if I describe this romantic comedy as predictable, it won't come as any surprise to you.  I had the ultimate ending figured out long before the story really got going.  However, I was left wondering how exactly they'd reach that outcome.<br /><br />Even more importantly, the journey along the way was fun.  While I didn't laugh as much as my friends, I was often smiling when I wasn't cringing.  I'm not a fan of comedy from embarrassment, and that's some of the humor here.  However, watching Hitch in action is fun.  He is so smooth it is remarkable.<br /><br />Finally, the characters made me care about the outcome.  Sara was the only one it was hard to warm up to, and by the end I cared for her, too.  The acting was great, which really helped.<br /><br />This is one of those rare romantic comedies that everyone seems to enjoy.  So if you are looking for a light film, give this one a chance.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|this was a great performence a real bloody and gorey tortureing movie hostal part2 was dissapointing but this first one was great.
1400032717|4.0|Book Fair was too crowded, so I took a detour to Commercial Press where I could leisurely browse over many books. No surprises at the management book corner, but I got this new book at a discount.    This is supposed to be a novel, but the plot is not too complicated. It begins with the main character, Christopher Boone, finding a dog stabbed to death by a garden fork at night in the backyard garden of a neighbour. He played Sherlock Holmes and started to investigate the murder of the dog and went on to discover secrets about his family and experienced an adventure. I shall not tell the ending of the story in case some of you may wish to read this book yourselves.    The value of the book is not the story, but rather the writing style of the author in telling it. Christopher was actually an autistic 15 year old boy who had behavioral problem and attended Special Needs school. He possessed a gift of doing advanced mathematics in his mind, liked red and hated yellow to the extent of eating only red food. He lacked the ability of communicating with other people and lived in a mind of his own. The book was written with Christopher as the first person and he narrated through the book. The readers are actually reading the mind of this autistic child, experiencing how he thought and felt, what his fears were and what calmed him down.    There are some interesting behaviour of Christopher as portrayed by the author. Whenever Christopher came across a difficult word, he would announce the definition of the word openly, which was quite funny in the middle of a conversation. Other people would look at him and wonder why he was stating the obvious. The author skillfully describes how an autistic child reassured himself by repeating known facts and details.    Christopher was unable to distinguish a joke from fact. To him, everything said were taken by face value. As a result, he thought jokes were real and people were really doing such silly things. When he discovered that people did not mean what they said in a joke, he thought they were telling lies. I think the author is trying to use a metaphor to demonstrate the hypocrisy in our daily life, that people said things they didn't mean, or tried to circumvent the true meaning of nasty words. The world is much simpler in the mind of an autistic child.    I recommend this book for leisure reading. It will only take you a short time a day for several days to read it through. Good for reading while commuting. You will be much surprised with the insight into the mind of an autistic child, and how much similarity there are to ourselves.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This was a great performence, shocking, thrilling, touture, enjoyment i really enjoyed it. I liked all the saws but part3 was not that good but theothers were, so this was a great movie.
B00005NTJK|5.0|Aqualung may be Jethro Tull's most commercially popular album, but it's predecessor, Benefit, is their best album.

This was an enjoyable pieace of work that they did i hope their future album would be awsome like this one cause this album was so awsome, great album.
B00005JPS7|5.0|...particularly by me.  But this is one film that actually manages to live up to everything one might expect from all that that word entails.  This is quite possibly the greatest superhero film ever. At times it leaves you nearly breathless, leaving you just enough to whisper \\"bada$z\\" in awe of what you just witnessed (a friend of mine actually did this).  The CG effects are wholly indistinguishable from the practical ones, the action comes in somewhat small but memorable doses, and most importantly the story takes it's time developing it's characters and their unique relationships.  And that is where \\"Iron Man\\" hits it's home run: characters you thoroughly enjoy watching that make the action sequences and special effects just icing on the cake.<br /><br />The movie does not waste time getting you into the good stuff.  The opening sequence does a great job of summing up the audaciousness, charm, and humor of weapons dealer/genius inventor/billionaire Tony Stark just before his caravan is attacked.  The last thing he sees as he dives for cover from the terrorists before blacking out?  An explosive with his company's name on it that sends shrapnel into his chest, setting the story in motion.  Beautiful.  Flashback to some days back and we get a better picture of our hero to be.  And let me tell you, it is good to be Tony Stark.  Robert Downey Jr. is everything you'd hope, bringing the kind of bombastic personality that just can't be portrayed in a comic book to the big screen. The supporting cast is also strong. Gwyneth Paltrow is radiant as Pepper Potts; snippy sometimes, cool and collected most times, and coy and awkward in potentially romantic situations.  Also worthy of note is Jeff Bridges' convincing performance as Stark's business partner Obediah.  The biggest change from the source material (and there are many) was replacing Jarvis the butler with a HERBIE-style (from the FF, not the Love Bug) talking computer.  But with the faithful butler having been done to death in the many Batman films, this change makes a lot of sense.  Also, Stan Lee's cameo is likely to cause outright guffaws, so be careful you don't spray your drink on the people in front of you.<br /><br />As usual, this Marvel superhero flick is peppered with references for comic geeks, lots of character-based humor, and moral arguments and choices.  Setting much of this story in the Middle East highlights the relevance of the story's message of accountability for our actions and our creations (I'm looking at YOU, America!) without being overtly political.  Tony Stark's realization that his works have brought death and destruction to so many and the subsequent hostile takeover attempt on Stark Industries when he attempts to do the right thing make for a great motivation to put on the armor and attempt to undo some of the damage that has been done in his name.  Good stuff.  And while it's no suprise that \\"Iron Man\\" has plenty of heavy metal in it's soundtrack, I wasn't expecting to hear Mister Stark admonish Miss Potts for turning down his [[ASIN:B000007489 Suicidal Tendencies]] jam.  Now THERE'S a superhero I can relate to. So cool.<br /><br />I find sitting through 10 minutes of credits intolerable, so I left the theater before they had finished rolling and apparently missed a scene that I had been hoping for.  Now I regret it.  Don't make the same mistake. That's what I get for not reading any reviews ahead of time (spoilers and all that).  Either way, this is not a film to be missed if you're a fan of superhero flicks, comic books, science fiction, or just entertaining cinema.  This is a film firing on all cylinders and is sure to please all but the most jaded of fans.  It's about time that the Golden Avenger got his big-screen due, but it was worth the wait to see it dome so superbly.  There is a moment where Tony's military buddy James Rhodes watches him fly out of his lab to save the day then looks to the side to see a chrome suit (the War Machine, I presume) and says to himself/us \\"next time, baby\\".  I wouldn't miss it for the world.elf/us \\"next time, baby\\".  I wouldn't miss it for the world.
0780631684|5.0|this was a really great movie when i first saw this movie when it came out in 2000 in the movie theater i was like wow my heart stoped beating i could'nt really eat my popcorn cause the movie was so dramatic,thrilling and breath takeing. When i saw the plain explode that really terrified me it looked so real then other plain movies it was like it was captured on tape that really had me at the begining then it gotten even better continuen the movie, this was a very amazing movie.
B000084T18|3.0|I know this album was the one who made 50 fifty!  And some of the tunes are real good but after the hype has gone and you liste to it again you'll notice that this is really NOT that good album at all. Not Bad! But not the great one and specially that to be compared to pac...    *They like me I want em to love me like they lov Pac....*      sorry mate...

0790729725|1.0|I needed to watch this for a film class, so I just bought the cheapest version amazon had.  In hindsight, I wish I'd spent a little more and gotten a decent DVD.  This is a double-sided DVD, with the movie split in half over both sides.  This means that if you're watching it in your living room, you'll have to get up and flip the disc over in the middle of the movie.  In addition, it is not anamorphic widescreen, so on a widescreen tv it shows up as a little box in the center of the screen (though on a fullscreen it should be fine).  Finally, it has no special features except for the trailers.  If you plan on watching this film more than once, invest the extra bucks and get the newer edition.

B00005JLWN|4.0|Mr. Yochum's 5/6 Senior English Class.  I thought that Equilibrium was a great movie. There was a lot of action in the movie. I thought that Christian Bale was great in this movie. I also found his character John Preston to be very interesting. I found many similarities between this movie and the book 1984 by George Orwell. For instance they both have a figure that is all powerful whether it is Father or Big Brother. Furthermore in the movie and book the main character ends up having \\"feeling\\" which in there societies they are not suppose to have. Also in the book and movie there are children that work for the government and turn adults in for not following the government's beliefs. The only difference between the two is that in the book the government wins, but in the movie the government is overturned.  Lastly, I found the movie to be a great thrill.
B0012E6R3W|4.0|WITHOUT A DOUBT!!!!!    This album is an excellent effort.  Considering it's damn near been a full decade since their last release, they have went through multiple cancer scares, lost family members, suffered broken bones and everything in between it's amazing that these guys even came back for another round!    Is this \\"The Gathering part 2\\"?  The short answer is no....but if The Gathering is a 10...this album IMHO rates a 8.5 or 9.  The writing is fantastic. You can tell the guys have been through many ordeals the last 10 years.  My favorite is track #9 \\"Afterlife\\", which deals with the loss of a father..and does so without a harsh religious overtone.    Some of the tracks remind me in tone of vintage Metallica...and really makes you appriciate how unlike that band these guys have returned to their roots (although they never strayed THAT far...I'm thinking of The Ritual)    Vintage Thrash bands are putting out some amazing stuff here of late, Testament, Megadeth, Exodus, Death Angel, Prong and of course Overkill..all have given forth some spectacular work recently.    So my advice....if you are a fan of Testamant's rougher sound from Low-The Gathering...you will love this latest effort.  If you long for Souls of Black or Practice What You Preach....that tone and sound has been long gone.    The ONLY problem I can come up with......come on guys...don't make us wait another 9 years!

It has to be built into a company's strategy, its goals, and its culture. And the leader of the organization must be deeply engaged in it.\\"  A significant portion of this book deals with managing people, including recognizing and developing future leaders.     Here are some tidbits:    \\"Realism is the heart of execution, but many organizations are full of people who are trying to avoid or shade reality.\\"    \\"You need robust dialogue to surface the realties of the business.\\"    \\"An astonishing number of strategies fail because leaders don't make a realistic assessment of whether the organization can execute the plan.\\"    \\"Only authenticity builds trust, because sooner of later people spot the fakers.\\"    \\"Some leaders drain energy from people and others create it.\\"    \\"You should strive for simplicity in general. One thing you'll notice about leaders who execute is that they speak simply and directly.\\"
0316010669|3.0|\\"Blink\\" reads more like a review of studies of the consequences of making snap decisions.  Guess what?  Sometimes you're right and sometimes you're not.  How enlightening.<br />Nevertheless, the experiments that are discussed are fascinating, and will give you insight into when to trust your intuition.
B0017VG69U|1.0|What a joke, This is the third release of the original series on standard definition DVD. How many times can they milk us??? For those of us Idiots that went out and Bought the HD version of the first season to now realease the second and one would assume third seasons just on standard without the high def is just adding Insult to Injury. WHY? As combos they still could play on either player? Not only will i not get this standard def set. at a ridiculous $63 i wont be buying in on Blu Ray either even though i have a player. The HD Version had picture in picture commentary on a few episodes along with a host of other features and whenever and HD is loaded with features if you check the Blu Ray versions its almost always just the movie or a cut down version of special features, why?? i thought blu ray held more and was better? Either way dont buy this. Im sure they will release this set on about 8 more formats in the next ten years in an effort to milk the public endlessly.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|I bought 'Greatest Hits' when it came out. And I was REALLY disappointed. Why did it start with 'Born To Run'? Where were his early classic albums like 'Greetings From Asbury Park'? Those questions I never could answer. But this set makes up for the below average single disc.    And, unlike the mediocre single disc, THIS IS A CAREER SPANNING RETROSPECTIVE!!! It's about time Bruce release a collection like this! It's simply amazing. It spans 1970-2002, his best period, and other than the omission of the huge radio hit 'Pink Cadillac' and the great album cut 'Ain't Got You,' this set is flawless.    'Blinded By The Light,' 'Born In The USA,' 'Rosalita,' 'Born To Run,' 'Jungleland,' 'Thunder Road,' 'The Rising,' and 'Atlantic City' all appear on this great 2 (limited editions 3) CD set.     This is an awesome Bruce set and it remains the best on the market. A must have for a new or casual Bruce fan. And, Columbia remastered the songs, so the sound quality is awesome!    Highly recommended. ENJOY!!!
B0014KD46W|2.0|There are two types of Steve Winwood music, and individual taste will dictate whether you will like this cd or not.  If you are the Winwood fan who perfers his R&B pop sound,[\\"Valarie\\", \\"Higher Love\\", \\"Roll With It\\", \\"Gimmie Some Lovin\\" etc], you are going to more than likely find this cd a total bore.  If you perfer his soothing layed back jazzy traffic feel to his music, you are probably going to find this cd enjoyable.  Having said that, after listening to this cd a few times, I find the cd to be somewhat uneventful.  Well played and sung, but nothing that is going to be memorable, or even ear catching for that matter.  Most of the music comes across as bland.  I found the best song on the cd to be \\"At Times We Forget\\", which at least grabs the listeners ear, and is the most listenable track on this collection.  \\"Dirty City\\", is another fine song, and features Eric Clapton, and predictably sounds as if it came right out of the Blind Faith era.  The rest of the songs  basically sound the same, with that jazzy slow uninspired sound.  Steve Winwood is a great talent, but sometimes I feel he goes overboard with this smooth jazz sound that I also feel takes the fire out of many of his live shows.  I do not want to sound negative, but this cd is nothing near his best work and is average at best.
B000002B30|4.0|As a longtime Bruce fan, I found this release just a tad bit disappointing. I still bought it and it's a great single-disc collection, nonetheless.    But now there are so many other collections. '18 Tracks,' 'The Essential Bruce Springsteen' and the 'Live 1975-85' are all out, and are quite a bit better than this, especially '18 Tracks.'    But this has all of the Bruce standards. 'Born To Run,' 'Badlands,' 'Hungry Heart,' 'Atlantic City,' 'Thunder Road,' and 'The River' are all on this set. And the sound quality is superb.    But why didn't they include a song like 'Rosalita,' 'Tenth Avenue Freeze Out,' 'The Tunnel Of Love' or 'Blinded By The Light' as opposed to one of the new songs like 'Secret Garden'? I loved the two new songs 'This Hard Land' and 'Blood Brothers,' but 'Secret Garden' and 'Murder Incorporated' just can't hold a candle to those two.    Overall, this is a good Bruce set that has it's moments, but if you want a definitive Bruce set, buy something else. If you are a die-hard fan just buying this for the new songs, than it's well worth it.    Recommended, but only for die-hards or really casual Bruce fans.
B000U7169M|5.0|this movie was fab. it holds your imagination right to the end i think it was just as good as the movie the seventh sign or even better.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|It's not entirely like the old stuff, but it's still got some groove. It's still a million time better than most of the junk being put out right now. At least there not another copy of the 80's that's the current craze.
0307388840|2.0|I really thought this book was extremely boring.  Moved way too slowly and there was honestly nothing in this book that made me WANT to finish it.  I would not recommend this book unless you need something to help put you to sleep every night.
B000UD08HW|3.0|That's what it says on the back of the box, instead of giving actual video specs.  Watch the concert for about 10 seconds and you'll realize why: there's no way this was filmed in 1080i or 1080p.  This is a mediocre looking concert \\"remastered in high definition.\\"        On the plus side, The concert itself is great and the audio is fine.  Disc 2 has a bevy of extra songs and footage from the tour.  But the regular DVD is cheaper and can't look worse than this.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Our family has been reading and really, studying Shakespeare over the last few years.  We have read Hamlet several times and seen several versions of Hamlet.  Kenneth Branagh's is absolutely marvelous.   The filming is wonderful and sumptuous.  The sets and places they filmed are like poetry for the eyes.  During the filming, they even got a snow storm which fit in with what they were doing. The actors are all wonderful.  Kenneth Branagh as Hamlet is excellent and Kate Winslet as Ophelia is marvelous. This is the only Hamlet film that has the entire play. The only fault I find is the scene where Hamlet is seeking his father's ghost and is in some wooded place.  To me, that part seems bizarre and created more to interest young people who are unable to be attracted to mere dialog, even if from Shakespeare.  The DVD of Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is a steal at any price.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|Execellent Movie, Denzel always gives a great performance from start to finish. Russell Crow also delivers in this movie, every Denzel fan must add this one to the collection.
B00154GEFU|4.0|I can't believe the stupidity of some reviews.  If you like Asia, you will enjoy this album, it is not a masterpiece but excellent performances of well-written songs.  If you did not like Asia in the 1980's then don't judge this release since you won't like it anyway.  'Nuff said!!!!
B00139XZF4|4.0|Very good looking movie on Blu-Ray and DVD, sound quality and picture quality where top notch. The movie itself was decent but needs to tell the whole story about how things are and how things came to be, if they would have touched on this they would have had a great movie, not just an ok or good movie to some.  As far as the Religious overtones to some this is way overblown. Religion has been exploited for years in many different cultures and many say everyone else is wrong, and are not very excepting of other peoples religions or ideas and that what the movie tends to point out, more so in the book. This movie is very watered down compared to the books and still people are complaining about it.... ;)
6304712936|4.0|This is a great film.  I missed the theatrical premiere of Amadeus in 1984 as I wrongly assumed that it was a thinly veiled documentary on the life of Mozart.  AMADEUS is a beautiful film that succeeds in adding depth to the two main characters.  It is not a musical documentary.<br /><br />AMADEUS was derived from the 1979 play of the same name and is loosely based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  The film focuses on the alleged rivalry between young Mozart and the Viennese Court Composer Antonio Salieri.  The story is told from the point of view of an aging Salieri.  In the movie Salieri, committed to an asylum after attempting suicide, confesses Mozart's murder to a priest.  In doing so Salieri recounts his association with Mozart and thus the story of Mozart's rise and fall.<br /><br />In watching the film you find no hard evidence of a homicide unless murder is defined as Salieri's infrequent attempts to stifle young Mozart's career.  Indeed the only assassination activity we witness is Salieri confessing to the crime.  Unlike the 1830's Russian Opera, Mozart and Salieri where there is no doubt that Salieri poisoned Mozart, the closest Salieri comes to harming Mozart is his mysterious appearance in dark costume to commission an a requiem - thus playing on Mozart's guilt over his father's death - and the all-nighter perpetrated after Mozart's collapse during the operatic The Magic Flute.  The bottom line is that Salieri's plots were little more than egotistical unrealized schemes and boasts of unfair divine intervention.<br /><br />AMADEUS can hardly be considered biographical other than occasional inclusion of historical events.  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was admirably portrayed Tom Hulc, who a slightly older 20th century generation will remember as freshman Larry Kroger from 1978's ANIMAL HOUSE.  Hulc played the part of Mozart stressing the composer's eccentric behavior and erratic mood swings in between his moments of genius.  In Mozart we discover a composer with a musical photographic memory able to commit finished great works to paper without so much as a rough draft.<br />Mozart was multitalented pianist and composer of operas, symphonies, and concertos.  He departs Salzburg for better prospects in Vienna.  Unfortunately Mozart's inability to humble or ingratiate himself before Antonio Salieri's incurs the court composer's wrath.<br /><br />F. Murray Abraham won a coveted Oscar as best actor for his portrayal of Salieri.  In AMADEUS Salieri is torn between his outright admiration for the gifted young composer and his jealous envy of Mozart's talent.  Salieri becomes obsessed with Mozart to the point of employing spies to report back on Mozart's work.  Despite Salieri's best efforts to derail or retard Mozart's popularity with Emperor Joseph II, Mozart brazenly forces his way.  As it turns out Salieri is one of Mozart's biggest fans and, though he often occupies obscure and low key vantage points at Mozart's performances, attends every one religiously.<br /><br />At this point in the film we sadly witness the downfall of Mozart.  The composer lives in excess of his financial means.  As such he is constantly fretting about his debts, yet that does not stop him from additional binge spending.  Mozart disdains the usual income generating scenarios of the day, specifically earning money through the musical tutoring of wealthy pupils, to the prolific production of works and displays of his talent at non-traditional venues such as an outdoor concert.  It is a great way to advertise talent, but hardly a means to pay the rent.<br /><br />Mozart is unable to come to grips with his father's disapproval of his marriage and his lifestyle.  He immerses himself further into guilt after the death of his father.  At this point in Amadeus, by means of the housemaid-turned-spy's report to Salieri, we are treated to the first hint that Mozart is not in good health.  He is reported to be guzzling medicine by day and alcohol by night.  This disclosure is the first clue that Mozart's days are numbered based on natural causes, not Salieri's baseless plots.  Still Salieri formulates what he thinks will be the ultimate irony in donning Mozart's father's former costume and mask and appearing anonymously at the Mozart apartment door.  In doing so he evokes both Mozart's fear and guilt over his deceased father, which only adds to Wolfgang's depression.  Salieri's plan is to clandestinely commission Mozart to complete a requiem.  His ultimate goal is to take possession of the completed requiem, claim it as his own work, and arrange its performance at Mozart's own funeral.<br /><br />Mozart however, has the last laugh in that he is persuaded by another associate to compose a lighthearted opera.  He puts aside the unfinished melancholy requiem and produces a successful performance.  By this time his unknown illness has itself reached its climax and Mozart is felled during the performance.  Escorted home to his empty apartment, Mozart is attended to by Salieri who offers to transcribe for Mozart and help finish the requiem.  Mozart's wife, who returns only moments before an exhausted Mozart dies, foils Salieri in his attempt to snatch the requiem.  The film then returns to an older Salieri recounting how his own music has been largely forgotten while Mozart's works have achieved legendary status.  Adding insult to injury the maestro is then wheeled down a hallway (looking more like a dungeon) housing some of the other more obvious insane inmates of the lunatic asylum.<br /><br />The AMADEUS soundtrack is chock full of beautiful segments of Mozart symphonies, concertos, and operas.  The majority of the movie was lensed in (what was then) Czechoslovakia to provide period realism. The environs of Prague survived the Second World War without signficant damage and many of the historic buildings required little in the way of set dressing.<br /><br />Although the film is part history and half fiction, it is a great introduction to the life and times of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  It certainly spurred me to pursue additional research on Mozart and his music.t's days are numbered based on natural causes, not Salieri's baseless plots.

0061544493|3.0|I bought this on a whim to read something girly while my boyfriend was out of town. I love fashion books and thought this would have some useful and fun little tidbits. Not exactly, but not a total waste either.     Victoria Beckham believes her own hype so deeply that it's almost impossible to take her seriously. When the book is not crammed with glam shots of her -- where it's often impossible to see what she's wearing, even though this is a style book -- it is filled with self-promotion in other ways. Every other page of the jeans section is her selling her own jeans line, when she recommends fragrances there's a giant picture of \\"Intimately Beckham\\" luring us in. A stupid move, as both of these lines aren't succeeding, and the book seems dated as soon as it's published. Better -- and much classier -- to acknowledge that you have your own lines in a small section, then focus on fashion and style overall. It would also be better if she had used other models to show examples of her style and fashion tips -- maybe a \\"posh makeover\\" or something. But this is not that book -- instead, the focus is suffocatingly on her, so much though that it's pretty funny at times. \\"Oh look at her again! Another pouty face! Long haired victoria! Short haired victoria!\\"    I think my favorite moment of unintentional hilarity is when victoria pleads with women not to wear bras with padding under tanks or t-shirts. Presumably one should have fake ones put in instead and have them pushed up the way victoria does? And the recommendation never to wear shorts with sneakers is ridiculous when there are fabulous little sneaks out there by John Varvatos for converse. The recommendation for high heels is, in general, myopic. There's nothing the world needs less than tiny women teetering on the edge of stilettos.     She has had an extraordinary career, even though underneath all of the styling she is a pretty ordinary looking person. When you look at her underneath all of the clothes and styleshe has really cultivated an image for herself -- perhaps her talent is self-invention. She is rigorous about every aspect of her appearance before she leaves the house -- something I wish was true of me.     I will also say that this book is going to be very useful on an upcoming trip to the UK, in terms of navigating high street brands for a little budget shopping.     So i'd say get it if you really like her, or if you have her exact body type and can copy styles directly, or if it's cheap, or if you care about the difference between H and M vs topshop in terms of sunglasses.
B0014KD46W|4.0|This album is such a welcome arrival into my collection. In a time where there are very few new artists with any...what's the word I'm looking for?...talent?!? And so many of my all time favorites releasing sub-par efforts or simply treading water, it is nice to hear someone remember what got them so far to begin with. No, this album does not break any new ground, but it does sound fresh. It's not just recycled versions of older songs.  It is an excellent choice for relaxing on a Sunday afternoon and listening to good music on the living room stereo...you know, like you used to do?
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|LOVED Confessions cd, but this one is not my kind of music. VERY Disappointed.  Worst of her all her albums in my opinion.
B00008OLIO|5.0|1981 was a peak year for rock music. I can remember being a sperm in my fathers nut sack and thinking about how SO many great records came out of this year, alot of bands were splicing styles, mixing up a raw breed of metal, punk, and glam, that hadn't gone into the void of hair metal yet. It was the pinnacle of a building rock sound that had started rolling around 1974, and just got harder, faster, and more tripped out as it went along.<br />Motley Crues debut album from this year is no exception. The following year would bring Shout At The Devil, where the Crue blew heads with a room filling, ace kicking sound (this was before the outrageous eighties production values) but on this first album, the production is very meat and potatoes, and is all the better for it. No other Crue album has the same straight up feel as Too Fast For Love. This one is a straight up hard rock classic. LIVE WIRE is a killer track, and is the template for most of the bands future hard rockers, but every other song on here a unique slice. Take the title track, completely a raw type of energy on that one, shout along chorus, almost a punk song. The ballady STARRY EYES with its haunted heavy mid break section. The ripping PEICE OF YOUR ACTION, or the head spinning MERRY GO ROUND, or the plain old bad assness of PUBLIC ENEMY #1. This is a rockin peice of work, and undoubtedly; along with the follow up, Motley Crues finest hour.
0137549202|5.0|I've used D.T.S.P. for a course and found it very satisfying. I've also read the Schaum's Outline by Monson Hayes and \\"Understanding Digital Signal Processing\\" by Richard Lyons, but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone really interested in the subject.<br /><br />This book can appear more intimidating at a first glance, but chances are that is just the fear of a mind not accustomed to precise, throughout exposition. Actually, such preciseness is the only way to really understand a subject and it is much harder to learn something without it (although, it's easier to delude oneself into thinking that one is learning).<br /><br />While studying on the Hayes' book I often found myself trying to reconstruct the steps taken to build and use a mathematical representation of a problem, and realizing that there were some informations I was missing; that the exposition made sense only as long as I didn't put it under a magnifying glass to see the holes. As my interest for DSP and my hunger for thoroughness grew I had to turn more and more to the Oppenheim-Schafer in order to find the missing steps, until I decided that it would have been easier to use it as my primary book.<br /><br />As for the requirements, there isn't really much: some basic calculus and, for some chapters, a knowledge of analog systems - something that you have probably already studied if you are doing this for university, and something that you should study if you are a diy enthusiast.<br /><br />If this isn't your biggest interest and you only need to pass an exam, the Schaum's outline should be enough. If you want to build a solid foundation in DSP design, acquire new mathematical models and the skill to use them (in my opinion this is a central part in increasing one's intelligence) use this book.
0307346617|5.0|Zombies, man.  I frigging hate zombies.  Slow, shambling, stupid, stubborn, ugly, and numerous, zombies are like the worst people you've ever met minus a pulse.  Ever since George A. Romero decided he wanted to make some corpses get up and lumber after the living, most people have thought of the same thing when they thought of zombies: Remove the head. Destroy the brain.<br /><br />Well, okay, maybe that's just me.  But a lot of people have considered the questions: how would I survive?  If things got really out of hand, how would any of us survive?  Max Brooks answered the first question with the Zombie Survival Handbook, and took a whack at the second with World War Z.  What resulted was a book about a whole lot more than how human civilization might handle a plague of the hungry dead.<br /><br />It could have been a simplistic gore-fest or a lame novelization of the zombie genre; there were really any number of ways Mr. Brooks could have gone wrong.  But he did what he and Mr. Romero have done so well: he made the world around the zombies, and the people menaced by them, so real that the notion of a reanimating super-virus popping up out of nowhere and creating the walking dead is the only suspension of disbelief required.  Accept the zombies, the possibility of zombies, and everything else follows like a flawless syllogism.<br /><br />The tale is framed as a book published by the man charged by the U.N. with compiling an official history of the numbers, tactics, and events that made up what is generally called the Zombie War.  Interviews with figures ranging from black-market surgeons and frontline soldiers to the head of the task force assigned to eradicate the zombies in the post-war era tell the story, from the warnings, through the Great Panic, and finally to Victory.  This gives the tone and voice of the story a lot of variety, as it swings from pensive musing, to bitter recollections, to traumatic flashbacks and back again.<br /><br />The reader watches as the world we know is bungled away, torn apart, and devoured.  Brooks makes you believe that it could happen, almost that its happening is inevitable.  I'm not talking about the zombies, either: Brooks has created an imaginative analysis of the flaws in our own crisis-control systems.  A drought, a war, an asteroid impact, a cataclysmic tsunami, or most especially a plague could all precipitate the worst horrors of World War Z, because as in all really good zombie fiction, the worst things that happen to humans are done by other humans.away, torn apart, and devoured.

B000E1MTZE|5.0|So obviously the Metrix Trilogoy is one of the better movie franchises in sci-fi genre ever created. In HD it is a whole new expierience! I have never seen such clarity. Sometimes HD movies just don't seem like such a huge improvement but with this boxset you will see it, it's shoved in your face :) The Matrix - lobby-shoot-out is jaw dropping. The freeway chase from Reloaded... you won't believe how close Trinity comes to some of those cars on her Ducati! Revolutions... well that is the 3rd and in my opinion worst movie. The assult on Zion will blow your mind apart with all of the detail you can now see. Passing on this set would be a mistake.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|It's horrifying, in a good way! It does make you squirm, but out of tension and apprehension, not out of \\"Oh, wow, this movie is so hard, I'm embarrassed for the actors and director!\\"<br /><br />While it's not revolutionary - requisite Asian ghost with dangling black hair crawling around - it does bring a more human side to horror and ghost's vengeance.<br /><br />There are some scream-inducing moments, and perhaps the Thai culture would seem a bit weird to Westerners/other Asians, but the secret Tun has been hiding from Jane will make everybody, regardless of culture, react in the same way. While I don't want to give away the wonderful twist at the end, this movie has an excellent ending that deftly wraps up hints and string hanging from earlier. It's probably one of my favorite movie endings ever.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|With 4 of the original 5 members of TestAmenT back together for this release we hear the band with their most solid lineup to date.  I'm a huge fan of Lou Clemente, but Paul Bostaph is simply a more technically proficient drummer.  Alex Skolnick's lead work continues to amaze me and you can hear the growth that has occurred in his musicianship over the past 15 years or so since his time at New York's New School University and various jazz/fusion projects.  Eric Peterson is hands down the best rhythm player on the metal scene and has yet to disappoint in over 20 years of TestAmenT releases.  Greg Christian still hammers the bass like no one in the business and Chuck Billy still sounds as good as he did nearly 10 years ago on The Gathering.  It's outstanding to hear that these guys are still in top form musically and can continue to make interesting music together.  The standout tracks on TFOD are F.E.A.R. and More Than Meets the Eye.  Overall this is an outstanding release and highly recommended!
B00005JMX6|1.0|I found this movie to be highly offensive and tasteless.  Something's wrong with Hollywood when it produces movies where teenage boys get lap dances.
1401902197|5.0|Okay, I admit it.  I wish my mother had Louise Hay's voice.  I probably would have grown up to be a normal person.  It's the CD that comes with this little book that gets my 5 star rating.  Yes, the CD is essentially what's written in the book.  But when you hear Louise read it, everything makes sense.  And it does.  If you put out positive, loving thoughts, you'll get positive, loving thoughts back. Simple, right?  Except when I say it, you probably smirk, or roll your eyes.  But listen to Louise just once, and you'll actaully entertain the idea that you can change your world just by changing your thoughts. I advocate buying this book so you can listen to the CD on your computer, in your car, at the office.  Your cynicism will abate (or at least lessen) and you might just believe all things are possible. Really.
1401300529|5.0|In terms of books written about it, the Korean War was the black hole of American historiography, compared to the large output on WW2 and Vietnam; a nasty 'little' forgotten war. With Halberstam's last book before he died in a car accident, the gap is a little smaller.<br />Most wars can be seen as a series of mistakes. The Korean War offers itself perfectly for that approach. We know who 'started' it, that was clearly North Korea's invasion of the South in June 50.<br />But who 'caused' it? If monocausal explanations are worth anything, then Dean Acheson surely is the prime candidate with his monumental gaffe of forgetting to include Korea in a speech defining America's interest zone in Asia. That was clearly the signal to the uneasy triad of Kim, Mao and Stalin, that an adventure might work. Which was mistake number two. They had not counted on incompetence in the US government.<br />Next: the breathtaking inefficiency of MacArthur's intelligence, his view of the world defined as truth, which ignored on a level of criminal negligence the reports that something was building up North of the demarcation line. (Comparable to intelligence failures before 9/11 and the lies before the Iraq invasion? This is what happens when intelligence is a tool for a pre-defined view!)<br />Kim's stupidity in ignoring the warnings about the Inchon landing. Lucky for the good guys.<br />The focus on conquering Seoul rather than blocking the retreat to the North for the invaders. Costly! Again PR value over strategy!<br />The silly amphibious landing in Wonsan, when the Marines could have gotten there easily and faster on land from Pusan. (And Bob Hope had to perform to a nearly empty audience, as the Marines were stuck in their ships when the harbour was mined.)<br />Not wanting to repeat the whole book here (which is 650 pages of bad weather and anti-MacArthurism, not to forget the brillant brief bio sketches of the main protagonists, that we are used to expect from Halberstam), let's jump into the phase when the war seemed to be won: next mistake, underestimating the enemy, caused by the same basic flaw: intelligence to prove what we know already.<br />The failure to anticipate the Chinese invasion was a massive misjudgement, equally hard to understand as the man's previous failure to expect the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Of course in between he had made the impossible become true and carried out the Incheon landing, which erased the memory of previous errors.<br />That in turn was the basis for the US government's next big error: not to remove MacArthur from his command in time. The man seemed untouchable. A very costly overestimation of his value. Of course how would a weak accidental president be expected to trust his own judgement more than that of a war hero?<br />The pity is that mistakes are never learnt from. That is of course mainly because we can usually not agree on the what and the who in first place.<br />Or sometimes, when they are learnt from, then in the sense of the generals who fight the previous wars: unaware of the law of life which says that once you know the answers, the questions get changed.<br />Skimming through the book later, it occurs to me that I ought to have mentioned the special story of the 'loss' of China, which was politically a very relevant background noise of the Korea War. Of course the tragedy of China's civil war was that there was no competent leadership on the nationalist side, and that furthermore the anti Truman forces in the US had decided to be so totally taken in by that fraud CKS and his Missimo. While Mao had his starry eyed Edgar Snow for propaganda, CKS commanded the loyalty of Henry Luce and his press empire. Luce turned out to be a mighty force for befuddlement of American brains. In comparison, Snow was not much more than a court jester.e war seemed to be won: next mistake, underestimating the enemy, caused by the same basic flaw: intelligence to prove what we know already.

B000YABYLA|2.0|This wasn't even the best pregnancy film of 2007 (that would be the hilarious \\"Knocked Up\\", which was 10 billion times smarter, funnier, and better performed and written than \\"Juno\\". If you haven't seen it by now, run out and rent or buy tout de suite!). In fact, if this film had not been written by a former stripper (Ms. Cody, whose story the media loved), I doubt that it would had made it beyond Sundance. I simply don't understand why everyone loved it so. I had heard just how witty and mature a teen Juno had been written; perhaps I had seen a different film, but to me she simply came acrossed as a snotty little brat. Making jokes about drinking and birth defects with the prospective adoptive parents of your child is neither witty nor clever; it is disgusting and immature. Intelligent, witty teens have appeared before; \\"The Breakfast Club\\", \\"Say Anything\\", in more recent years, \\"My So Called Life\\" and \\"Felicity\\". These writers knew how to make teens sound mature yet vulnerable; realistic yet insightful. Cody does not. I knew I was in trouble 5 minutes into the film with the exchange between Juno and the beyond weird clerk, but I was hoping against hope that he was simply a quirky character. Alas, he was not. Every character here (save for Ms. Garner's, which is the only well written and evolved role and ultimately the only one you'll root for) is written to be as odd as possible. I know that this film was aiming to be the next \\"American Beauty\\" with its off beat cast and dialogue (not to mention that Ms. Page could pass as Thora Birch's sister), but it doesn't come close to that film's greatness and simply is a shallow attempt. How unrealistic is it? When the parents are told that their 16 year old daughter is pregnant, they react far less than my parents when I had brought home a puppy without their premission. The father of the baby never has or seems to desire a say in the future of his unborn child (not to mention his parents. If my child fathered a baby, I would want to raise it rather than to have it go to strangers and never to see it again). Juno (who, contrary to the poorly researched film, was named after JUPITER'S wife, not ZEUS'S) is obsessed with the 70's and punk music; which is strange since she plays acoustic guitar not punk noise. After the baby is born, there is no emotional crisis, even though Juno herself makes a point of telling us how much it hurt when her mother left her to start a new life. Does she not realise that she had done the same? There are simply no really consequences in this film. In real life, having a baby while in high school (even if one does give him/her up for adoption) comes with the risk of being overlooked by colleges, massive physical and emotional upheavels (just dealing with regular teen hormones is difficult enough; imagine throwing pregnant hormones on top of that), a postpartum body that never looks or acts the same as the before version, etc. Nevermind that the boyfriend never has to take responsibility for anything. If my daughter became pregnant while in high school, the very first phone call would be to the boy and his parents. Basically, Juno treates her unborn child like one would an unruly puppy: just give it away to someone with more time and space in their lives. While antiabortion people might love the fact that she carried to term, I don't think this film gives either a positive message, cautionary advice, or much in the way of laughs (besides Juno's comment about how Sonic Youth just sounds like noise. I completely relate). This film wins the bronze medal for pregnancy films of 2007, with \\"Knocked Up\\" being gold and \\"Waitress\\" coming in silver. Watch those if you really want to laugh at pregnancy mishaps.
B0000CBHOI|5.0|If you love music and love the Blues, this is a must have for your collection.
B000002U8G|5.0|The music on this album flows seamlessly from the beginning track to the epic 20 min.+ \\"Echoes\\". In my opinion the greatest Pink Floyd album of all time, I absolutely trip out to this album, the feeling is 100% euphoria. Best enjoyed with high quality headphones on. Get \\"up\\" there, sit back and enjoy the trip.
0440236738|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I had been hooked on Harlan Coben's sports agent series and decided to try this stand alone book.  I'm glad I did.  I thought there was a lot of depth to the characters.  I felt the twists in the books weren't outlandish.  They actually made sense.  I thought that Mr. Coben did a great job explaining the past, the present and how they all went together. He led you down the path about two characters and then show you how everything isn't always what it seems.  I thought it was fast paced enough to keep my attention and didn't take long to read at all.  I would highly recommend this stand alone book along with Coben's sports agent series.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I knew that I wasn't going to like it, and still I watched it. I tried! They got it all wrong on so many accounts that I am trying to figure out where to begin. I really didn't care for this portrayal of the characters, they made the mother look like a sweet little lamb just trying to get her daughters married, Mr.Bingley like a bumbling idiot,and the three youngest girls act like children! Keira Knightley is beautiful, but a woman with that kind of flat chest would have been considerd deathly skinny, and not a man would have wanted her because she has no figure. They also portrayed the Bennets as being poor. Which is incorrect because the man didn't expect to have five daughters and therefore didn't make provision for there dowries.They were actually supposed to be upper middle class people. Lydia Bennet bothers me as does the relationship between Lizzie and Her father. They are supposed to be close, but through out the whole movie there relationship seems strained until towards the end where her father says that he will miss her.Boom! Right out of no where. And Lidia Bennet is supposed to be tall and good looking for her age, that's why she can attract the officers like flies. She flirts and looks cute. But no! The actress that plays her looks like she is a tall twelve year old. And speaking of looks, were they trying to go ugly when they cast Darcey? I thought he was supposed to be rich AND handsome. And if the guy that played Mr.Wickham would have wanted me to run away with him, I would have cried from insault! But, on a lighter note, they did cast Mr.Collins well. He is about as creepy as a little man can get. And this movie has some great cinematography. But the cons definantly weigh out the pros. I almost winced whenever Lizzie or Darcey spoke their lines, their delivery was awful. If you want to see THE BEST adaptation of a truely great story, stick to the unmolested version. Stick with Colin Firth and the BBC version.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|when the movie first started I was ready to take it out! but I was patient! once it got going it turned out to be a good movie.  I reccomend this movie.  I would watch it again. Good acting and good special effects. I JUST HATED THE ENDING!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I have never written a review for a Music Album in my life and I am honored to make this my first. After listening to In Rainbows, I felt spiritually transformed and obligated to clarify Radiohead's continued musical genius and originality with In Rainbows. Radiohead has given us 10 masterufully unique, soul-evolving gems. From the moment I put the cd in my car the music gave birth to a beautiful, raw, and colorful world within my soul. I refused to return home until it was over.  I was somewhat suprised and saddened once it was all finished, not that it was too short, but simply because it was over. I was so obsorbed and involved in the world that the instrumentation had sucked me into, that once it was done, time had flew by so quick and yet so peacefully as well. The track list is perfectly organized and each song effortlessly fades into the next smoothly and peacefully. Playing the album in a shuffled order would still not detract from its magnificence. This album is completeley refreshing and I can't wait until my next car ride. I know one thing is for sure, If I am ever trapped on an island for the rest of my life, Radiohead's In Rainbows will be right by my side. Please reward yourself by listening to this masterpiece of an album. Thanks, and Enjoy : )

B0012E6R3W|5.0|It was a nine year wait for this follow-up to The Gathering, probably one of the best metal albums of the last 20 years. How do you follow an album like that? Like this.    To be as succinct as possible, F.O.D. is a stylistic step back to their classic 80's thrash style, with the addition of heavier, more modern production. It's essentially 2/3 Souls of Black and 1/3 The Gathering. There's a lot more melodic and rhythmic structure here, track 6 even sounding a tiny bit like Opeth with the off time signatures. The brutal, hammering double kick of The Gathering isn't nearly as evident here. Chuck Billy has also mostly abandoned the death-style vocals of the last 2 albums.     Is this a good thing or a bad thing? For me it's a mixed blessing. I loved 80's Testament and still do, but I personally would have liked a bit more of The Gathering's unbridled aggression here, but that's a small quibble. This is still a whomper of an album and well worth the wait. It's a crying shame that the lunkheaded populace will spend all year moaning about how crappy Metallica is and ignoring these fantastic new discs from Anthrax, Testament and other contempories who have been making amazing music all these years to virtual indifference.    Great job guys. You keep making them like this, and we will keep buying them. Just don't make us wait another nine years please ;)
0679735909|5.0|POSSESSION is by no means a perfect novel. Any work that forces you to consult a dictionary or encyclopedia as often as this one does, surely can't be praised for it's simplicity or lucidity. The narrative is dense with arcane words, figurative language, historical and literary allusions. Ms. Byatt's erudition can at times be overpowering. I suppose that density can in part be explained by the fact that this novel is as much about the power and joy (not to mention sensuousness) of language, as it is about a Victorian romance, paralleled by one in the 20th century under the guise of an intriguing mystery and detective story. The modern protagonists are literary scholars and their subjects are poets whose intellect and language skills act as a powerful aphrodisiac in their affair.    What totally blew me away about this novel was that Ms. Byatt was able to synthesize all the critical and sundry elements into a coherent whole that not only had my attention riveted throughout it's wild temporal transitions between the Victorian era (through the correspondence of the poets and journals of their intimates) and modern English society through the inquiries and travels of Roland Michell, Maud Bailey, and their contemporaries, but also contained insights into the psychology of male and female relationships as it pertains not only to physical, but to intellectual and emotional needs.    What is even more amazing, is that Ms. Byatt herself, in the creation of Ash and LaMott, has proven herself to be a poet of outstanding ability and sensibility. She has breathed life into these characters and their poems, so much so, that when consulting my encyclopedia on the likes of Vigo, Swedenborg, Swammerdam, Wordsworth, and Donne, I would almost have expected to find articles on Byatt's 2 fictional Victorian poets as well.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|Affectionately satirizing the pop scene from the '80s to the present, this soundtrack knows its stuff and always strikes the perfect balance between poking fun and producing a legitimately good pop album. Hugh Grant surprises with his unassuming vocals, Drew Barrymore sings with delightfully sweet competence, and Haley Bennett guilelessly captures the contemporary pop diva. Every singer pleases; every track satisfies.     And who knew you could still write a good '80s song in 2007?
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna has made the ultimate followup, entitled Hard Candy. Just as good as her previous album COADF, Madonna mixes some of the dance/electro feel of her COADF album with her older stuff.<br /><br />The album opens up on a Nelly Furtado-like note with her song \\"Candy Shop\\". \\"Don't pretend you're not hungry, I've seen it before\\", she sings. This song is very sexy and kinda reminds you of \\"Promiscuous\\" by Nelly Furtado!!! Then we Transite into \\"4 Minutes\\", which speaking of Nelly Furtado, has Timbaland in it! Also featuring Justin Timberlake, the song is very catchy, and is one of the best songs on the album. We re-visit the 70's boogie scene with \\"Give it 2 Me\\", the feelgood song of the year!<br /><br />We have a ballad, \\"Miles Away\\", which is very powerful. I love \\"She's Not Me\\", \\"Dance 2Night\\", and \\"Spanish Lesson\\", which is an incredibly sexy song. The album ends with \\"Voices\\", which is an incredibly dark song, but closes the album PERFECTLY.<br /><br />Overall, this is Confessions II. An amazing album, it lived up to my expectations, and There's not one bad song on it! Every song is freeking great!<br /><br />Overall, by far the best album of 2008.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|This is a simple review.  See \\"The Mist\\" instead.    Cloverfield is a boring one and half hour of headache inducing nothingness.  There is only one good scene in the movie which I won't ruin should decide to waste money and buy or rent this.    You see \\"the creature\\" briefly.  Instead you follow a bunch of morons trying to be the next Blair Witch Project in New York.      So if you want a great monster flick that serves on many levels do yourself the favour and see The Mist instead.
1419551795|2.0|The exercises are OK to improve your score. I went from mid 600s to lower 700s after working on the 2006 GMAT 800. And that is exactly why I think this book is not worth it. I went to the store to buy the latest edition of GMAT 800 and to my surprise I realized that 90% of the questions were the same as in the 2006 edition. I think it's morally wrong to sell a new edition of these types of books that it is esentially the same as previous versions.
0440234743|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was fast paced, very descriptive, had interesting characters, held my attention throughout, and it had lots of drama. My kind of novel.
0793518326|4.0|Yeah, there are errors; but with so much of it right on, me thinks it's as much a printer's error rather than the transcriber's error. And sure the font could be bigger, but then you'd have to have 2 or 3 volumes, and 2 or 3 times the cost. Overall, an outstanding attempt to capture the Fab Four's sound on paper. Now, where's the revision??
0790729393|5.0|\\"Sleepers\\" is an exceptionally fine and disturbing movie.  The cast is superb.  Kevin Bacon does a fearsome job in a thoroughly repellent role.  Robert De Niro plays a warmly sympathetic, street-knowledgable priest, and Brad Pitt does a very compelling job with his role as a prosecutor who sets up an important payback.  Dustin Hoffman could not be better in his portrayal of a disgruntled, unsuccessful defense attorney.  And he's nothing to look at in the role.  It's one of his finest performances.  \\"Sleepers\\" is a rewarding, haunting movie.
B000P12LWY|4.0|This Showtime series is a very good showcase of historical figures that aren't really represented in the truest of light, but rather used a means to entertain.  We've seen this many times and if you're looking for a documentary this isn't your show.  However, this is entertaining television and interesting enough plot.  The actors are quite well chosen, great cast alignment here and unlike HBO's Rome, this isn't overtly violent with blood in the streets every go round, its a bit more character based.  So if you're looking for a good political drama this might be a good bet for you.  If you want to see the year by year play out of the real historical figure, it's not for you, this is after all FICTION.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Creo que este es el peor album de madonna. Musica absolutamente biodegradable, canciones que parecieran ser de cualquier artista dance que comienza su carrera. 4 minutes creo que ya es lo peor que ha hecho, es casi como escuchar temas de N'Sync o Backstreets Boys. Es un tema que escuchandolo más de 2 semanas no querras escucharlo nunca mas. Que pena ya que habitualmente Madonna sorprendia con un nuevo estilo y considerando que era el ultimo trabajo con Warner Music, el publico se merecía un trabajo mejor realizado y no lanzar un disco rapidamente para cumplir un contrato.
B000TGGJKK|4.0|I enjoyed this movie more the 2nd time around!!I still dont like that a cowardley Paris, kills Achilles(Sorry for those who havent seen the movie). Had Paris been more like his brother Hector i wouldve been ok, I have no idea why they decided to go with the Paris character in that direction but oh well, this is still an amazing movie.  I rank it the 3rd best movie in this genre under 300 and Gladiator.  The movie just looks amazing in HD so bright and vibrant the colors just hit your eyes as a feast to the gods!!!Sorry for that bad analogy but this is really and entertaining movie which just blows your mind away.
B00000DM5P|5.0|Radiohead's story, I think, is pretty well-known. Their initial release, [[ASIN:B000002UR7 Pablo Honey]], was weak mock-grunge with a few exceptional songs. One of them was \\"Creep\\", the biggest hit of their career (I think), and the one that got them pegged one-hit wonders. But [[ASIN:B000007363 The Bends]], a fantastic album, proved everyone wrong, netting the group four more hit singles (\\"High and Dry\\", \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", \\"Just\\", \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\". Then this came out, and elevated Radiohead to new levels of fame and critical attention. And it deserved it.<br />The first song on the album establishes its tone well: Daring, experimental, and melodic. \\"Airbag\\" rules, with a heavy guitar in one speaker and a cello in the other, as well as funky drumming. Fantastic lyrics about surviving a car crash, which could be read as reincarnation, and powerful vocals from Thom Yorke. Plus there's this cool part where the song temporarily ends, only to pick back up again. \\"Paranoid Android\\", the best song on the album, is even more ambitious. It's taken in three parts: a quiet acoustic section, a blistering hard rock part that made me jump out of my seat the first time I heard it, and a chilling mass choir conclusion. And weird lyrics. \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" is considerably more mellow, and strikes me as an early wandering into techno, before the group went into it full-on with the fantastic [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]]. By contrast, songs like the amazing, U2-like \\"Let Down\\" (with overdubbed Yorkes), triple-guitar crunch of \\"Electioneering\\", and the almost optimistic, really catchy \\"Lucky\\" are actually pretty close to traditional rockers. But really, really good ones. For another contrast, take the record's two hits, both of them ballads. \\"No Surprises\\" is depressing lyrically but has one of the most gorgeous melodies known to man; and the Beatles-quotin' \\"Karma Police\\"  is an eerily impersonal piano ballad that takes a shot at the system.<br />Just for a bit more diversity, there are also a series of spooky, impenetrable songs here. My favorite of these three is \\"Climbing Up the Walls\\", a devastating portrait of either a schizophrenic or a murderer. I haven't really made up my mind on it yet. \\"Exit Music\\" is quite underrated, reaching a chilling climax. Finally, the gently waltzing \\"Tourist\\" closes the album on a high note. And if that wasn't enough, there's also an anti-materialist spoken word piece (\\"Fitter Happier\\").<br />I just can't shut up about this album. A highly recommended portrait of the walls between our society. It's cold and detached, and while that may be a turn-off at first, subsequent listens may reveal that the lack of emotion actually bolsters the message.sity, there are also a series of spooky, impenetrable songs here.

B0017VG69U|5.0|Ever since I watched the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\" back in 1996 and saw the classic Enterprise displayed with modern effects, I dreamed about one day seeing the entire Orignal Series retouched in such a magnificent way.  10 years later, that dream came true.  Granted, the series does still retain that 60's feel (especially with the bombastic style of the music, and of course the \\"military uniform\\" mini-skirts), there was so much of it that made for great television even for today.  The effects being updated really gives the series credibility and believability for viewers and allows the original series to fit in properly with all the incarnations that came afterward.  Bringing it to High-Definition was truly a great idea, and the live-action image quality is drastically improved, so much so that at times it gives the series an entirely new feel!<br /><br />Agreed by both casual viewers as well as die-hard fans, the second season of \\"Star Trek\\" provides us with a multitude of favorite episodes.  Two episodes in particular that are given excellent treatment and incredible updating are \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" and \\"The Immunity Syndrome\\".  \\"The Doomsday Machine\\", next to \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" is considered one of the best from the Original Series, even in its unrefined form.  The updating on this episode put it into near movie-quality, far surpassing many Star Trek episodes, includng many from other spin-off series, and even perhaps a couple of the motion pictures.  An interesting effect, to me, was how the remastering of \\"The Immunity Syndrome\\" made a not-so-great episode into a spectacular episode!  The 1966 effects were good at the time, but the remastering gives it a whole new sense of realism and scope.  Other classic episodes like \\"Amok Time\\", \\"The Trouble With Tribbles\\", and \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" are given good treatments, also.<br /><br />As of August 6th, I've purchased this set and have been thoroughly enjoying it as much as I knew I would.  One of the most common complaints of one-star reviewers is that this season, unlike the previous season's release, is ONLY on DVD, not on Blu-ray or even HD-DVD.  Don't let that discourage you.  Even in this standard DVD version, Star Trek is given new life unlike ever before.  This DVD's visual quality is far better than any previous releases, especially since that this is a down-conversion of the cleaned-up High-Definition source.  On a regular 480i/p CRT TV, it looks superb.  On an HDTV, a good 1080p DVD up-converter will give you an excellent picture from the DVD; granted of course, it will not be the same as an HD release (no up-converter can do that, but they can get close).  The truth of it is that this DVD will be better than what you can see on broadcast TV.  I've even noticed that the standard DVD quality is better than the \\"HD\\" TV broadcasts.<br /><br />There have also been those who have wondered what Gene Roddenberry would have thought of this rebuffing of the series.  To answer that, here is a segment from an interview with the executive producers of the remastered project on that very question:<br /><br />\\"What do you think Gene Roddenberry would think of the remastered effects?<br /><br />Dave Rossi: When Gene passed away and his estate requested that all memos and paperwork from the Original Series through TNG be turned over, I was the person whose job it was to wade through 27 years of material. One theme that popped up with some regularity in Gene's memos was \\"What can we do to improve the visual effects?\\" While that alone isn't an answer, the support the Roddenberry family and people like Bob Justman have shown during this project really reinforces the notion that Gene was always striving to improve the effects to help bring the world of Star Trek alive. We're honored to help fulfill that wish.<br /><br />Mike Okuda: We had a number of long talks with Matt Jefferies before he died. For understandable reasons, Matt was oneof our heroes. He was inwardly very proud of his work on Star Trek, but he was always very apologetic for the limitations of 1960s production techniques. He kept saying how he wished he had the technology that was developed after the show ended. We always responded by reminding him that his designs were a major reason why the show remains successful and watchable to this day. At the same time, it convinced us that he would have been the first to stand in line to update his own work, if he had been able.\\"<br /><br />Bottom Line -- If you are willing to wait for the Blu-ray versions, that's fine.  I'm not.  As a lover of the Original Series, it's just too good to pass up.  My hat's off to to all those who participated in this extraordinary remastering effort and for turning a dream of mine into reality.his work on Star Trek, but he was always very apologetic for the limitations of 1960s production techniques.

B0011U8NZ2|5.0|When Bright Midnite announced they were releasing concerts of the last major Doors tour I was intrested because I went to this show. Looking back what struck me as intresting is back then the Doors were on tour but they were not supporting their latest album (Morrison Hotel); they played 1 song from it: Roadhouse Blues. Looking at bands today and over the past 30 years that really has never been the case they because they feature songs from the newest album when on tour. The Doors were always about perfomance art and this is a good example of it with the ad libbed jams on songs like When the Musics Over and the opening Backdoor Man. This is what also makes the Doors and the time when this album was recorded special. Jim Morrison is a legend and his talent and poetic spirit shines on this CD. I love it because I was there and it is a part of what defines my tastes in music today.

Although the movie has its good moments of sleuthing and grittiness what makes this movie is its 7 min. car chase.  What makes this car chase the ultimate car chase is that Steve McQueen is the actual driver of the 1968 Mustang from start of the chase to end of it.  All through out the chase the cars are driving at actual speeds through San Francisco, unlike many movies since even today where they simply speed the film up to give the illusion of driving fast.  Again this is a solid detective movie but what sells this movie is that chase!!
B00154GEFU|2.0|Hey I waited just like everyone else for the reunion album. Remember when everyone wanted the Beatles to reunite for an album? Yea, the electric anticipation was in the air! Uh-Oh set up for big let down. This album is not cutting edge like their first. Far from it. The drumming is muted and even dull, average at best. The sexy golden voice of John Wetton is not put to the test. The keyboards and guitar work that was expected to be awesome was just okay. Sorry to say, this is not a memorable album. The only thing I can say is I hope they stick it out and get down to serious shi_ and make another album. Progressive rock, did not rise from the ashes, rather the embers are still waiting for the fuel to unleash a raging fire. I guess we just have to wait a little longer and may be  rewarded for our patience and prayers.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Hard Candy is full of great beats and catchy songs. All of the songs have been stuck in my head at one time or another. My favorite track is \\"Give It 2 Me.\\" The whole album is bitter sweet! The only song I don't care for is \\"Spanish Lesson,\\" I skip over it all the time! I have to admit that Madonna has really done an amazing job of keeping up with the times. I can understand why she hired all the \\"big shots\\" in the industry. She may be growing older but she is still really sexy! People say that \\"She needs to act her age,\\" \\"She's too old for those sexy songs.\\" If I have to remind you people Madonna's whole career has been one sexual journey! I also have to admit I have liked everything that she has done but wasn't a hardcore fan till \\"Confessions.\\" I love the club/europop sound and she continues to perfect her sound with each new album! I also have a question for everyone that has dissed \\"Hard Candy?\\" If you dislike it so much why are you buying her tickets? Peace and good luck, Madonna! This fan is here 2 stay!
B0001I562I|4.0|Remember that era of the movies that seemed to touch our hearts. The ones before we really understood how movies were made, and before we started to loose that magic touch of adolescence and didn't care how sappy or poorly acted films were, because well, we just didn't care. It didn't matter because films like this, 'Explorers', 'Neverending Story', 'D.A.R.Y.L.', 'Enemy Mine,' all seemed to be part of the USA Saturday morning routine, and for years I would always say in my minds eye, how they were my very favorite films as a child.<br /><br />Many state that films like Flight of the Navigator can't hold up to the test of time. That is such a boldly ignorant statement, at least for me. I watched it yesterday for the first time in a decade, and it was as touching and memorable as the first time I saw it. Joey Kramer, in his only leading role, before dropping off the face of the earth, carried the whole entire film in that Henry Thomas/Barrett Oliver way, and if Paul Reubens wasn't beyond brilliant as the voice of Max, the computer alien aboard the spacecraft, and how can you not love Veronica Cartwright, as the endearing mother, I mean honestly.<br /><br />Before the world became bills and deadlines, there were movies that shaped many girls and boys growing up in the eighties, and I for one can type with a smile that goes from cheek to cheek, how wonderful it was to have lived my childhood through films that truly touched at our hearts. Flight of the Navigator, sap et all, is certainly one of those timeless classics.<br /><br />Cheers
B000V8I2QU|3.0|I've been a huge fan since '74, have everything released, attend multiple shows each tour, etc.  I think this music is brilliant, but, while I love the songs and the production, I dislike the engineering.  The compression and distortion results in listener fatigue quite quickly.<br />p.s. I liked the production/engineering of The Rising, so I am not bashing Brendan O'Brien in any way.
B00005JPNY|5.0|I love the trilogy and nearly died in joy when they decided to create the movie. I'd read rumors in a mag 5 years back, but nothing seemed to come of it. The movie was all I expected. A fairly accurate portrayal of the book, minus the ending. Heres where I hit my question. The movie previews have scenes that never happen in the movie, such as Mrs. Culturs and Lord Astrial (please don't mind the misspellings of the names) kissing. Those of us who have read the book will know that that scene is after where the theatrical version of the movie cuts off, avoiding the grisly ending... (BWT, if they keep Roger alive and use him to replace Will I shall be furious!!) Does one of the dvd editions have this scene, and the rest of the ending? I want to buy the correct edition!
B00154GEFU|5.0|Being a fan of the work of all the members of Asia and Asia in particular; and after seeing Asia in concert last year, I was very excited for Phoenix to come out.  I had the following thoughts on the album.  Forgive the disjointedness of my comments.  1.  The album sounds as though it could have been lifted from around 1985.  That's not to say it's a bad thing.  If you liked Asia, Alpha and Astra, you will enjoy this album.  2.  One of the things I loved about Asia and Alpha was the breadth and depth of the sonic landscape that Howe and Downes crafted.  Listening to those albums, for me at least, always took me to another place.  Phoenix does much the same thing for me.  This is also what separates Asia music from Icon efforts or Wetton solo discs for that matter.  3.  Both Steve Howe and Carl Palmer really play within themselves and the songs.  There is nothing over the top from either of them; however there is plenty of great playing in the context of the songs.  4.  Is it me, or does Steve Howe tend to play slightly behind the beat on a good number of his solos?  5.  Don't expect full blown prog.  Asia was never \\"that kind of prog.\\"  6.  Steve Howe contributed a great song, \\"Wish I'd known all along,\\" complete with a very cool sounding background vocal (surprise).  7.  John Wetton is in fine voice.  8.  As much as I loved the first three Asia albums, I've always felt that Alpha and Astra suffered from some sort of overproduction that seemed to muddle the sound.  On Phoenix, it seems the band managed to separate out the textures better.  9.  \\"An Extraordinary Life\\" can't help but make one feel good.  At the risk of ruining the review for some of you, its chorus could almost serve as a breakfast cereal commercial.  Someone better call the Wheaties people.  10.  Phoenix is packed full of very strong melodies.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|All I can say is that after listening to this record, I am very surprised. All the hype around Madonna \\"going hip hop\\" - having a \\"mid life crisis\\", \\"losing  her identity\\" and the hype around Justin Timberlake, Pharrel etc being on this record, was all for nothing..     Hard Candy is pure Madonna. It is her sound, and it is her style. It is brilliant, catchy pop with strong hooks and brilliant melodies. It serves up the same memorable pop tunes that she has been offering up for the last three decades (e.g. Papa Don't Preach, La Isla  Bonita or Liker a Prayer)... In many ways, this record goes back to her roots, her eighties and early nineties sound, more than any of her recent albums ever did.     What also surprised me was the disco and electro-sounds of this album. Expecting hip hop, I did not expect to hear hand claps, guitar strumming and whistles on the music on this CD. With Hard Candy, Madonna has delivered one of the strongest albums of her career.     What's also interesting is that first single \\"4 Minutes\\" doesn't even come close to being the best song on the CD. This honor goes to there tracks \\"She's Not Me\\" (one of her best songs in a very very long time with an old-school disco beat), \\"The Beat Goes On\\" (has to be a single! This song has #1 written all over it) and \\"Give It 2 Me\\" (one of the catchiest and most inventive pop songs heard in a very long time, and second single of this album). Additional tracks like \\"Incredible\\" and \\"Dance 2nite\\" offer more pop gold on an already stellar album.    Even the slower songs like \\"Miles Away\\" and \\"Voices\\" offer some awesome old-school Madonna melodies, mixed in with Eastern sounds and haunting lyrics, providing the most well rounded album Madonna has released since \\"Music.\\"    What's funny is that \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" was Madonna's much-hyped \\"dance record.\\" But with Hard Candy, Madonna has delivered a dance-pop album like no other.
0793518326|5.0|Awesome in it's scope and presentation.  I don't know how publishers of songbooks or sheet music get away with publishing so very many wrong versions of songs.  We all pay good money so we can learn how to play our favorite songs - and so much more often than not, these publications are wrong.    Not this one.  E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G is here, and it actually correct!  You may think its a little expensive, but it SO worth the investment.  I cannot tell you how very much I am thankful to my friend Corey for telling me this existed!
B000XTLUW0|5.0|While extra features are rather slim (or none at all, to be precise), to get an audio CD AND a full-length concert DVD for under $20 is an outright steal. The footage of the concert itself is spot on, and the audio (on the concert DVD as well) is also fantastic.    If you've been a longtime fan, you'll be disappointed over some notable omissions, but with four full-length albums out now, expect a lot of old favorites to be left off of setlists from now own. Also, with the amount of energy these guys (especially Matthew, the lead singer) put forth into each show, to play any longer than two hours could spell death.    In short, a must for a fan, and cheap enough for someone fairly or even completely new to the band to pick up and see for themselves.
B0012Q732O|3.0|The trailer caught my attention.  The cinematography was good but that is where it all ends.  I think there was some effort to do a type of Mel Gibson Apocalypto movie but where the Apocalypto hero had you riveted this hero was not so captivating.  Once you see the trailer, you have seen the best of this movie.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Confessions on a dance floor was amazingly different and new to its time. Hard Candy seems to be a follower. Some beats off Hard Candy, I think I've heard before, but I still enjoy! The lyrics, always spectacular from miss Madonna. Hearing Justin on some tracks adds to its listen. THE best track is Miles away, and the truth in it is so exactly on point. The track Incredible puts a big smile on your face, a feel good song. It seems to me, that Madonna is happy with her life, after 50 years. Devil wouldn't recognize you, LOVE the beat, the piano is amazing and Justin adds to the tracks a special touch. Overall, some songs I skip, Spanish Lessons and 4 minutes. Overall, great music, once again, from the queen of pop, who took a tiny stop at urban.
0486411818|3.0|The text is obviously considered a benchmark for FEA.  The date of the first edition causes me to guess that it was among the first serious texts in the subject.  For that reason, the book is worth the some of the price.  But, detractors reduce the worth...    Two major items detract from the usefulness of the text:  1. It is written for a mathematician.  So, reading is a little rough for those who are learning the notation as they read the book.  2. The text spends pages describing examples using and an appendix providing user information for software that is missing from the reprint.  This subtracts from the value, even if the code is a source in FORTRAN, because excellent examples of FEA implementations are missing.    It turns out that the source code and a compiled executable for DLEARN is available on the web.  However, you have to know where and how to search.  [...]
B0016HNOXQ|1.0|\\"We really wanted to sound like ourselves but not sound like ourselves. It was always going to be difficult.\\"  - Geoff Barrow (excerpt from Pitchfork interview, 04/07/08)    I hope no one thinks this is a statement worthy of contemplation, awe or any of the other misguided admiration we place upon contemporary musicians. It strikes me as yet another inarticulate rambling by a garden-variety, pseudo-intellect. And if you read the interview in its entirety, you found yourself dumbstruck at how utterly ordinary the members of Portishead sound (like, totally...). I, at least, had previously cultivated a perception of them being a savvy collection of renaissance minds, melding the headiest of musical genres to create Portishead. How dreadfully wrong I may have been.    Looking back, Dummy was and still is deserving of the universal plaudits it has received to date. Portishead, while not as revelatory as Dummy, if only for the fact that it came second, is equally deserving of its countless accolades. These two albums, along with releases by Massive Attack and Tricky, are commonly credited as being the prototypical blueprints of the trip-hop genre. Marked by a mysterious sensuality, expertly conceived sampling and accented by Beth Gibbons' halting vocals, Portishead have since been widely regarded as one of the most sophisticated acts since debuting in 1994. Portishead's newest effort, titled Third, represents the first offering from the Bristol trio in ten years. But was it worth the wait?    No one anticipated the release date of Third with more optimism and excitement than I. And while I hoped for Portishead to raise the lofty bar they established so many years ago, I am left hugely disappointed by what feels like an intentional effort to divorce themselves from the elements which made them so brilliant in the first place, if only for the sake of shrugging off their iconic sound as a means of maintaining their credibility as innovators.    Portishead's music has alwaysbeen characterized by a level of tension. Whether through composition, lyrics, instrumentation, engineering or a combination of all elements simultaneously, Portishead have always relied on melancholy as a key element of their sound. In spite of their cloudy disposition, Portishead found a much larger and diverse audience than anyone ever expected, from sorority girls to flannel-wearing, coffee house misanthropes. All the while, Portishead have never straddled pop comfortably and maintained a status as outsiders and innovators.    However, their past music never asked so much of its listeners without a payoff. At the height of tension, Portishead's ability to pull back and offer some release has always been among their most sublime strengths. Third has no such release. Tension follows more tension until the listener is expected to accept a premise with no conclusion. For a band so adept at seamlessly blending the contrast of such smoldering sensuality and unnerving dissonance in the past, and for being credited as the touchstone for an entire genre of music, their latest effort represents a disturbing step backwards, rather than any sort of progression from their other releases.    Unfortunately, and not necessarily for the better, Portishead have only reinvented themselves. If their initial efforts can be credited with creating a genre, this venture falls painfully short of doing anything beyond changing the group's approach to its own music, rather than acting as the new standard bearer for their trip-hop denizens.    Portishead's stark departure from the sensual sound which gained them such a loyal following and nearly universal critical acclaim suggests that, while they desperately wanted to evolve their sound, the end result demonstrates only the ability to crudely deconstruct, rather than add depth to their brilliant foundation.
B000R7I3LY|1.0|Love song is stupid.  It will be critiqued 5 years from now on vh-1 by mediocre comedians.  It is so pathetic.
B000WCBMA8|3.0|by far the worse one yet. good, but not up to par.  a little to disco man rockish
B00139B39E|5.0|Se estaba echando de menos una buena recopilacion de este extraordinario grupo lider del rock progresivo metalico integrado por 5 virtuosos que se presenta bastante bien compensada en rapidos y lentos con calidad a raudales. Bravo
B0013FDM7E|3.0|The basic premise of this movie is that a virus is unleashed and most of the population on Earth is killed off.     Some people do survive because they have a natural immunity to the virus, while many others without a natural immunity to the virus become infected by so called \\"Dark Seekers\\", whom are mutant vampire like creatures that only come out at night & attack those that aren't infected.    Will Smith carries the movie and is the primary actor in about 90% of \\"I Am Legend\\". Smith does a good acting job and plays the part of a military research scientist trying to find a cure/vaccine for the virus to help save others. Smith's character does find a cure for the virus and dies protecting the cure for the virus, hence becoming a legend for the remaining survivors.
B000000W5L|5.0|Muy bueno que siempre se sigan editando estos clasicos de los mas grandes de los grandes, los Stones y una de sus obras maestras. Ya no se hacen discos tan buenos como este sin tanta parafernalia electronica.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|Apparently 3 times was not a charm for Portishead.  I still listen to Dummy and Portishead every few months even 10 years later.  I even popped in the Roseland VHS to watch for the umpteenth time less than a year ago.  When I found our Portishead was finally going to release their 3rd album, I was elated! I had very high expectations. Unfortunately, so far, Im just not feeling it at all. Beths voice are still perfection, but the tracks just aren't up to par with their previous releases.  Its not as smooth, its not as haunting(as humming), and its not as catchy! Overall, its a big big disappointment for me. Still its too early to call it my all time biggest musical disappointment ever!  The two tracks that dont seem like total duds are silence and plastic.  The latter sort of sounds like Beth when she was with Rustin Man.  But even then none of the tracks on this album compare to mysteries from that album.  Perhaps, there is nothing that can touch the genious of the first two albums.  Im still waiting!  Maybe fourth ;)
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Such an excellent video series! Highly recommend for people of all ages. Gives such a great look at our world! Really beautiful on blu-ray!
B000F0UV0E|5.0|CD arrived in a reasonable amount of time, about a week, in excellent condition.  Very satisfied with product, price and delivery.  will buy more cd's this way as a result.  Mark Chapman
B000VL9XNI|5.0|This is a great collection to add to your AC/DC stash! So much great footage, good quality and totally worth it if you're a big fan!
0812550706|5.0|OK. Your a sci-fi fan. And your curious about whether or not reading this book is worth the time and money. Heres your answer: YES.<br /><br />  Card's name will be right up there with Heinlein, Clarke, Williamson, Gibson, etc...etc... and not just because of this book. Ive read a bunch of his stuff and can honestly say that a new major player has earned his way into the Sci-Fi pantheon.<br /><br />  Yes, buy this book. Enders Shadow is also good. Speaker for the Dead made me cry (and I aint a cryin man lol) and Xenophobia was good as well but be ready...Card likes to experiment with differing story styles so dont expect carbon copies of his latest hit. Enjoy.
B0010X73ZG|3.0|While Stephen King is an incredible story teller (His books) brought to life on the big screen are o.k. and not o. k. The Langoliers was an incredible story and a good film,if only we never saw the Langoliers. Much like the Mist, the creature that came under the door and got the kid was really fake looking. Now with that book firmly in both hands late at night,my imagination of that creature would have scared me much more. Hollywood needs to understand that character development and the story it self are key,not CGI. Want a good scary story or two? Get the Twightlight Zone. The Black and White are the Best!
B00005614N|5.0|... It must be close. I have hundreds of CDs of all kinds of music (Jazz, blues, rock and roll, pop and classical) and if I had to choose one, this would be it. Louis is in top form and the Duke's compositions and arrangements make a perfect product out of this. Sound quality is excellent, too. Don't think it twice and buy it.
B00005JMX6|5.0|I love this movie. I thought this would be a lame movie since it hardly made a dent at the box office, but it turned out to be an AWESOME movie.  The acting and writing is amazing. I really like the screen chemistry between the characters Matthew and Danielle---they were very believable. This movie really tugs at the heart of what it feels like being in High School and wanting to fit in and do fun things.     The music was also great in this movie. If you're deciding to get this movie but not sure, I say get it--it's a brilliant movie.
B00000269M|5.0|This is an amazing album with 5 top 10 hits.  This is Michael at the peak of his powers. Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Dirty Diana, Leave Me Alone, I just Can't Stop Loving You, Another Part of Me, Man in the Mirror, and Smooth Criminal are all iconic Michael Jackson tracks.  The quality of these songs are comparable to that of Beat It, Thriller, Billie Jean, Human Nature, PYT, Baby Be Mine and the other hits from the Thriller album.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Great price, fabulous package includes lots of extra features and classic interviews with key players.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|As many fans, I was upset with the lack of ability to finish off the Ori arc because of the series's cancellation. However, I think this movie fills the void. Old favorites and enemies arrive, and more background on the Ancient and Ori conflict.    The acting was done well enough that I actually liked Carter in the movie, which is a rarity. In fact, I used this movie for a school project because of the writing and how it related to religions. The only thing I would say I wasn't happy about was I felt like there was a missing time period between the ending of the series and the beginning of the movie. Perhaps a brief 30 second \\"this is what we've done\\" explanation would be been nice.    I loved that Claudia Black was able to show Vala in a different light, to allow the character to grow again. TI'm not going to spoil anything - what's the point in owning the movie if you know the plot? - but it's definitely a well-produced, well-executed, well-inspired movie. The writers didn't fall down on the job as they have during later seasons of the show.    Simply put: if you want to know what happens with the arc and have some fabulous behind the scenes extras, then I'd recommend the movie. I'm a stingy customer, I don't buy movies aren't 10 dollars or less, but I don't regret the movie purchase. That's a big deal for me.
0142000671|5.0|This books is on most reading lists, and it is easy to understand why.  Beyond merely a 'classic,' the book stands next to 1984 as literature that remains good reading long after it was written.  The language is modern, the symbolism deep, and the story short but compelling.    I've read Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, a book I did not enjoy very much.  If you have enjoyed one of his previous books, regardless of the experience, I suggest picking up this book.  If you haven't read his other works, I strongly suggest picking this one up first.
0525950079|2.0|I had just finished reading Pillars of the Earth and looked forward, heartily, to World Without End.  I am a great fan of Ken Follett, but in this book he totally disappointed me.  What I saw him doing was taking Pillars of the Earth and repeating it by simply changing the names of the characters.  It was exactly the same story so I knew beforehand exactly what was going to happen.  For example, on Page 350 they were running out of time to cart the stones to build the bridge in World and they solved the problem by the Prior granting \\"indulgence\\" to the townspeople who would volunteer to cart the stones.  This is exactly what happened when they needed to get the cathedral built in Pillars.  Ho Hum, a huge yawn.  I could have done as well writing this book.  No imagination, no creativity, no initiative in coming up with a new book.  Just a different title and year.  I am so sorry because I love Follett's writing.  He could have done much, much better.
B0013D8LG8|5.0|First Knight, First Rate!<br /><br />Arthurian tales run the full gamut. From poor to exceptional, the various Camelot retellings share commonalities. King Arthur, Camelot, Lancelot, Excalibur, Merlin (usually), and Guinivere. There have been exeptional casts, but \\"First Knight\\" is an unusually wonderful ensemble.<br />Sean Connery, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond portray Arthur, Lancelot, and the lovely Guinevere respectively. Connery makes a wise, fatherly Arthur with his love for the beautiful lady of Lyonesse his only blindness, and Gere gives an outstanding performance as a 'hero' torn by his passions. Julia Ormond projects joy, passion, and pertubation as the love triangle between Lancelot, Arthur and Guinever grows more complex. From a young mistress destined for marriage with Arthur, to a woman inflamed with passion for one she cannot have, Ormond projects joy, pertubation, and desperation from a pure heart. Gere is a cad in the beginning, making obvious advances towards the queen to be with no discernable results. Even as he joins the round table as knight, his inner struggle takes a toll during his rescue of Guinevere in the lair of Malagant. The only distraction other than his perfect hair is his lack of any Anglo accent, which Connery and Ormond deliver so seamlesssly.<br /><br />The turmoil in the film is not only between Lancelot and Arthur, but also the devious Malagant whose border raids into Lyonesse grow more bold as the wedding between queen to be and Arthur draws near. Malagant was at one point, a knight of the table, actually the first knight until his path for power forces him to leave the group. The commentary states that Malagant is the first angel/Satan image in the film as he leaves Camelot to be ruler in his own hell. At the same time, Arthur is Gods' servant, seeking His will before his very own, putting the needs of the kingdom ahead of his own. Lancelot is transformed from wayward wanderer into a devoted knight of the realm, taking over as Arthur falls in battle during the trial of Lancelot and Guinevere for treason. Biblical examples and themes run through the whole film.<br />The beauty of the film is not only in the story, but also the scenery.  Wherever the filming took place, it reflects the glory that `was' Camelot in our minds.  The natural scenes are breath-taking, and the cave formations that Malagant uses as his headquarters (fittingly underground), are wonderful.  Truly dream-like architecture characterizes the city that was Camelot, the ideal.<br /><br />My only concern is the documentaries used in the film.  Only one delves into the Arthurian legends, while the others are based on the film itself.  I guess I am more of a history buff than a medieval romantic.<br />[...]in battle during the trial of Lancelot and Guinevere for treason. Biblical examples and themes run through the whole film.

0452289963|4.0|When I talk with most people about meditation, I usually end up listening to a litany of complaints about why they *can't* do it. \\"I've tried it, and my mind just can't sit still long enough to do it.\\" \\"I'm too busy - who has time to sit still these days for a whole half hour?!\\"    In that vein, I enjoyed reading A NEW EARTH - and am enjoying its deserved success. No, Tolle doesn't say anything new here. You can get some of the same basic ideas, e.g., from the works of Pema Chodron (and you should). It's Tolle's presentation that matters. His words are plain and forceful; it's obvious on every page that he *gets* it. More importantly, he doesn't create a \\"plan of action\\"; rather, he gives techniques throughout the book that anyone can apply in their own lives, at any moment on any given day: being aware of your breathing; examining an object without naming it; asking who it is who's observing the thoughts and emotions coursing through your brain. A NEW EARTH is a spiritual practice for people averse to spiritual practices.    I've docked this book a bit because...well, I'm partial to meditation. :) Practicing meditation as taught by spiritual masters throughout the ages can greatly accelerate the weakening of the \\"voice\\" of the ego. Tolle's made remarks in interviews to the effect that a \\"spiritual practice\\" can easily degenerate into egoic excess. He's right. But I'd prefer he address this in the same manner that Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche did in his book CUTTING THROUGH SPIRITUAL MATERIALISM, rather than dispensing with spiritual practice altogether.     If you're new to any type of experiential spiritual tradition, A NEW EARTH is a great \\"gateway drug\\" to the richer teachings of the classic contemplative traditions (Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jewish or Christian mysticism).
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Unfortunately as with all great artists, Many people will compare current work to past triumphs. Everything released should be viewed in and explored for itself. With that said, Third is going to let down many people for the sheer fact that such long awaited anticipation tends to make us more demanding. I personally love this groups work but i'm no biographer of the members and history and such. So i took this album in for what it is and without comparison/contrast check list in hand as is so common with reviews on here.  Highlights for me would be Hunter. extra somber hang yourself tune. The Rip is beautiful. Plastic is a fun track and an interesting mix. Deep Water makes for a neat little change in the usual Portishead formula and stands out as such and Magic Doors is bound to be well recieved.   We Carry On is decent and has a panicky sense of urgency. very upbeat for this group. The openning Silence also has a similar pace as well and is so-so.    Nylon Smile didnt really go any where for me. I'm not a big fan of Machine Gun. It's basically a repeated drum loop for almost 5 min with some synths popping up here n there while the lady does her thing. Small might just have to grow on me but my initial impressions are not exactly overwhelmed. The closing track, Threads, feels overly drawn out like Small and had me chuckling to myself when the singer begins yodeling like a goat toward the close.  I feel like Third is a mixed bag. It's a strong comeback work that hopefully kicks the group back into gear because their sound never gets old to me. It's stark visual searing mourning time again!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Another timeless, wonderful, thought-provoking, atmospheric example of their work. Lovely and Lush; interesting on all levels and a perfect mix of traditional instruments, electronica, and rock. I am a huge fan and am convinced that with this latest release, they can do no wrong (just ask Christopher O'Riley). It's right up there with my other favorites Kid A and Amnesiac. Favorite tracks so far: Weird Fishes/Arpeggi (compelling, orchestral - the echoing backup vocal is romantic and stunning), All I Need (gorgeous, evocative piano), House of Cards (a sweeping, lusty, erotic seduction), Jigsaw Falling Into Place (the striking melody and power of this song is unmatched). Easily one of the best albums to come out in the last 30 years of modern music. These guys are truly the apex of the entire rock music industry and have been for some time now (OK Computer). In Rainbows has so many intricate, haunting layers to experience. I hope Yorke and company keep giving us more for years to come.
B00154GEFU|5.0|I am blown away by this entire album.  It has been such a long time since I owned music that I could and almost needed to listen to over and over.  There is so much depth, range of emotion and unbelieveable musicianship that I would recommend this album with my entire heart.  If you loved Asia in 1982-83, they'll reward your loyalty with Phoenix today.

B00005JLEU|3.0|I am not a fan of Japanese Anime. Though visually, they all look great and unique, the story plot is somewhat confusing for those not familiar with the genre. Spirited Away has it's great moments. The creatures are interesting and again, the visual effects are truly eye opening. However, at times, the movie just spirals into a completely different plot and you almost have to get your bearings about what is going on. It jumps and gets pretty weird at times. My husband, who is a fan, explained that alot of anime movies are shot like this. He actually told me that 'Crouching Dragon, Hidden Dragon' is basically a live-action Anime film. Like I said, it gets pretty odd at times and young kids may not understand alot of what is going on. It is better geared for the older crowd who can better appreciate the story.
B00169N0BK|5.0|I recently recieved the ColorMunki Photo as a gift from my wife.<br />Being that I just got into the whole color management thing I was a little intmidated by the thought of creating my own printer profiles.<br />Well, the Colormunki software walks you through the whole process. It even make the changes in Photoshop so when I print all I need to do is soft proof it then hit print! I also used it on my Apple cine. display and it never looked better....
B000GCFO0I|1.0|This is a B-movie if i ever saw one. Its only appeal is that its so bad that its actually funny. I found myself laughing through out the entire film.  Every time i heard \\"BURN THE WITCH!\\", I had to ask myself, does she weigh as much as a duck? Yes, the way they say it would make sir sir bedivere proud.    I hadn't played the game before seeing this movie. The game does have a much better story, even as silly as it is.     Chyeah, 30 yrs in that place even though apparently they need to eat, monotonous long dialogues that add little if anything to the pitiful story. mostly because the script is boring, or silly.     The only, and i do mean ONLY good thing about this movie is the skill involved with the graphics. thats it. the acting is horrible, the people are cliche'd badly. O my big city rich folk dragging their problem here. how do you like that city boy. o please. o ja lets not forget the, o my god, im in a strange deserted foggy town, this shambling monsters coming towards me... ill tell it to stop :D. please stop mr. monster or ill shoot. the little girls acting sucks, but is better than everyone else.    this movie is a blasted comedy. if anyone reading this thinks of buying it, prepare for a good laugh. its full of gore, still is hilarious, but sucks beyond understanding. i think this movie was meant as fan service, like final fantasy advent children or jiggling breast and panty shots.
B0013LKZWS|5.0|This album is truly brilliant. I am a long time Fiona Apple fan and although Sara is not quite as brooding and profound as Ms. Apple she certainly has some very clever lyrics and great catchy piano based pop/rock. This album also has a greater appeal to the general population i'd say. I'm excited to see what she does in the future.
0765316889|5.0|This book is great in it's complexity.  Keeps you guessing all through to the end, and even after.  The characters feel more real than most in books of this genre. I can't wait for book 3!
0321146530|4.0|Overall, this was a great read.  I love books with tiny chapters, giving you good stopping points where you can meditate on what you just read while you're busy with life's other challenges.  Beck goes into TDD as well as design concepts such as you might find in Scott Bain's Emergent Design book.  Patterns are also lightly discussed.<br /><br />I also love Kent Beck's casual writing style.  For those of us who don't have 16 hours a day to devote to our computer, it's nice to have some humor and casual speaking happening in a book which only a hardcore reader will read -- like myself.<br /><br />I give the book 4 stars, but there are a few *glaring* question marks.<br /><br />First, there is no introductory chapter on using JUnit or any other *Unit.<br />Kent wouldn't have even had to write such a chapter himself - maybe one of the tech reviewers!  You have to give the reader something to go on, even if you just merely assume the reader will use JUnit in a CLI dev environment.  Or discuss all the assert calls.  I dunno.  Weird.  But not a huge deal, and I knew how it worked already, anyway.<br /><br />Second, and this is a biggie, why on Earth Kent would choose as an example writing xUnit for the second section is so beyond me I have no words.  He hints later that he likes to write a *Unit library for each new language he learns, as an exercise.  But, good lord, it's so hard to wrap your brain around incestuous \\"writing yourself\\" concept -- couldn't he just written something else?  We're trying to learn TDD here.  Geez.  I mostly skimmed the whole section as it was too hard to follow.<br /><br />Third, in that same section, Kent decides he will move away from Java, a language most of us already know and, if not, looks like a whole host of other languages so it's easy to follow and fairly verbose.  Right, he decides to use -- ready? -- PYTHON!  A language very few people know and has some strange idioms.  This would be akin to writing the chapter using arcane Ruby or Perl structures.  The whole second section has you trying to catch up on the language and the recursive xUnit example so much that it completely distracts from the TDD lessons.<br /><br />OK, here's a fourth.  Two very good examples for TDD are practically side notes.  I used his late-book example of a Triangle class to do TDD for real for the first time and it was an excellent example!  I did it all and only when I completed it did I read his tests.  It was great, and I look forward to trying out the Fibonacci Sequence which is an *appendix*.<br /><br />Why not put these in the book and explain them?<br /><br />But it's still a good read.  Try to avoid buying it for $40 - $50 though.  I read it in 2 days without much effort, so not sure it's worth the price.  But it's still very good despite all this.ction has you trying to catch up on the language and the recursive xUnit example so much that it completely distracts from the TDD lessons.

0440238609|5.0|We've bought this trilogy from our 12 y/o son's Christmas wish list. He is Harry Potter fan and LOVED these books. He rereading it over and over and still finds the stories entertaining. As far as a parent's concern - great buy!
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|SUMMARY:  Madonna's final album for Warner Brothers is by no means her best, but it's a fitting swan song for the artist who anchored the label for the past quarter-century.  A lot of the reviews for this album are missing the mark, either overzealous in its defense, or obtusely critical in the hope of shining the spotlight on another artist.  'Hard Candy' is a mixed bag of true gems and questionable choices, but it's quintessentially Madonna.    WHY YOU'LL LOVE IT:  When Madonna hits the mark, no one does it better, and even her detractors would be hard-pressed to name another artist of her caliber.  Despite what others have said, no two Madonna albums are the same, which is why she has remained one of the most relevant artists in the past twenty-five years.  While a few of the songs here are reminiscent of earlier works (in a good way), they're also very much current and a part of her ever-evolving musicality.  'Hard Candy' is thus at once an homage and a contemporary statement.  There's no shortage of danceable material here, and few artists are willing to take the chances in which Madonna revels.    WHY YOU WON'T:  Several of the tracks are overproduced, and Madonna's vocals are all but lost in their delivery.  Noticeably absent is the vocal maturation she has consistently displayed since Evita.  Her voice is high and thin - as it was in the early days, and which is unfortunately drawing comparisons to Britney Spears (who really is nothing more but a poorly-conceived clone) - but she mostly makes it work for these tracks.  'Candy Shop' is truly an abysmal song, despite its irony, and was a poor choice to open the album.  The less said about '4 Minutes', the better, but don't make the mistake of judging the entire CD by its lead single - the whole of 'Hard Candy' has a distinctly different flavor than this disposable track.    BOTTOM LINE:  Madonna is not interested in repeating herself, so fans who are expecting 'Confessions II' will be vastly disappointed.  Many are proclaiming that Madonna is simply reproducing the recent efforts of the bevy of pop songstresses (Mariah, Britney, Christina, Nelly, Gwen, etc.) currently populating the landscape.  Not true.  She was here long before them and, in the cases of many of them, will be here long after they fade away; it is they who owe a debt to her.  Those who understand Madonna, however, and who get her sense of humor, her irony, her deliberateness, and who know enough to look beneath the deceptively simple lyrics, will be pleased to add this to their collection.  Standout tracks include 'Heartbeat' (which should be the next single), 'Miles Away', 'She's Not Me', and 'Devil Wouldn't Recognize You'.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Great family movie. Definitely a good choice for a family fantasy. Has an excellent cast, a good combination of a fairy tale and love story. CG was not over the top, but tastefully done. Would recommend.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is a sweet movie with some very adult themes.  The adult themes involve teenage pregnancy, abortion, adoption, and adultery.  The story is told in such a fun and forthright manner, featuring some exceptional acting from Ellen Page and Michael Cera, that you get the feeling you are peeking in on real people.  A joy to watch and a memorable movie, it is no wonder that the film did so well with critics and at the Academy Awards.  A warm and gentle movie with some very heavy themes.  A 5 star film that is well-worth watching a couple of times.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|How fabulous is it to have ALL Gilmore Girls episodes and wonderful features ready to watch at home at any time you like? I am absolutely delighted with my purchase. The only downside I can think of is that season six does not have English subtitles for the hearing impaired.... That was a bit of a bummer... The boxed set is made well and does not take up as much space as you'd think for over 40 DVD's. All in all, great stuff!
B000RIHBIE|2.0|After taking the pop-punk formula to the politcal/hardcore style that they saw on their last two records and then, suddenly losing a guitarist, you already know when you buy this CD, before you open it up or play any of the tracks, that it's not gonna sound like \\"Chuck.\\" It's not gonna sound like \\"Does This Look Infected?\\" Chances, are, it won't even sound like \\"Half Hour of Power\\" or \\"All Killer,\\" this is a new band.    Well, it is a new band. It's definitely not as good as the old Sum we used to love, whether that had before or after the dividing line that was \\"Fat Lip\\" This is the bands worst CD, even if it was their most valiant effort.    The first thing that comes to mind is that without Dave, all the metal/hardcore/whatever influence is gone, it's back to the poppy-punk and it's more on the poppy side. The first couple tracks almost sounds like a return to form, except after that it regresses into ballads and we realize that this is not the case.    The CD has it's moments. There are catchy guitar lines here and there from Deryck and Cone stepped it up to make up for the lack of a second guitarist (even though some of the songs are still recorded with 2 guitars). Cone's backup vocals are a new twist to the CD and I actually like them a lot. They should have utilized him earlier.    Biggest problem, too many ballads, too many slow songs, makes this CD relatively boring. This CD would have been a great EP if it had consisted only of \\"Underclass Hero\\" \\"Count Your Last Blessings\\" \\"March of the Dogs\\" \\"The Jester\\" \\"King of Contradiction\\" and \\"Confusion and Frustration in Modern Times\\" Everything else is skipable but those songs are truly amazing. We can tell that Sum 41 is still here, burried in the rubble of all the drama and bull. I wouldn't be surprised if they rose to the occasion a few years from now and put out a truly outstanding CD, but for now they're still trying to construct that old fasion Sum sound without Dave, they'll get there, but they're not thereyet.    All the die hard Sum 41 fans will find this touching, anybody else, stick with any of the other 4 CDs.
0756404746|5.0|I am an avid reader of Sci-Fi / Fantasy.  I average 2-3 books a month, so I have read quite a few novels.  This book is one of the most refreshing and enjoyable I have read in several years.  I am continuously amazed by this book and find myself reading passages to my girlfriend, something I have never been moved to do by a book of fiction before.  I recommend this book highly to anyone who likes the genre, I honestly have nothing negative to say.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|I'm not alone in my thinking of the first Superman movie as the very best comic book adaptation of all as well as a GREAT accomplishment in film making.  The (original, theatrical) Superman II was a great success as well, however, it lacked the grand qualities of the first installment.<br /><br />So what happened?  This DVD tells that story (as well as some quick searching on the internet will find as well)<br /><br />Under no circumstances should you get this without seeing the original theatrical release of Superman II.  This cut simply isn't finished.  It is a compilation of what they were able to find that was shot by Superman I director Richard Donner and restore it to make what is *almost* the complete Superman II theatrical movie.  Again, every foot here was shot by Donner (or by assistant directors under his supervision).  It's explained that Richard Lester, the director finally credited for Superman II, had to do > 50% of the film in order to get that film credit.  So they had to remove a lot of Donner's work, and insert some of Lester's work for him to get the final director's credit.<br /><br />While the restoration represents a great accomplishment, without it being complete, not to mention other problems (see below) it doesn't really stand on its own for others besides film buffs and fans of these movies.  There are many \\"in between\\" shots missing, choppy editing and the ending is a complete film school exercise because as is freely admitted in the commentary, it was used in the first movie and they were going to come up with something for the second, but didn't get to do that, and so there it is.  Any greater expectations will be disappointed.<br /><br />For fans, however, the video is very interesting. IF you have the original Superman II to reference, you'll see (by way of omission in this disc) what they took out, what Lester DID do (like the slapstick touches in the midtown \\"blowdown\\") and you'll be able to see how they managed to piece it all together.<br /><br />I have tremendous respect for Richard Donner, but his commentary (without which this DVD would be nearly worthless) comes off as quite bitter at times.  But, considering that Donner was about 85%-90% done (as you can see from this), when the rug was pulled out from under him, even after Superman I became such an incredible success, I understand why Donner harbors such ill will toward Lester (whose name is never mentioned in this) and company.  You can tell Donner is holding back what he really wants to say.<br /><br />The one truly great value of this DVD is showing the scenes with Marlon Brando, showing the story arc of the father and the son, and how that basic narrative and story arc was completely lost in the theatrical version.  For that, I can only recommend this for those truly interested.<br /><br />For others, however, especially those who haven't seen the original theatrical release, I would recommend AGAINST getting this.ct for Richard Donner, but his commentary (without which this DVD would be nearly worthless) comes off as quite bitter at times.

B000068OCS|5.0|This movie made a huge impression on me.   It started my appreciation of the others in the series, and started me off on American minimalist music.    I can't express how much I love this movie.    So....when's the HD version out?   When it comes out on HD, I'll buy an HD player.
0142001104|5.0|I was fortunate to hear Ben Zander speak at a business conference in early March. The book captured the best of his 2-hour, frenetic, compelling, interactive, inspiring presentation and further fleshed out the major themes.<br /><br />Eight weeks later, I still think of his stories and messages every day.<br /><br />Zander and his wife strike just the right balance between philosophy and pragmatism. What makes him particularly credible is that he applies his messages in a very demanding environment - running a world-class all-volunteer orchestra for 30 years. He's more than just a positive thinker and his life hasn't always been about the art of possibility.<br /><br />On a tough day, I think of \\"It's All Invented, \\"Rule No. 6\\" or \\"BTFI - playing it the second way\\" and simply recalling one of Zander's stories is enough to shift my perspective and approach.<br /><br />That's quite an accomplishment for a 200-page book.
0373771665|5.0|One of the most disreputable of Heyer's heroes but also one of the most engaging. Not much plot but the usual wonderful dialogue and eye for detail. The developing relationship between Venetia and Damerel is totally believable. Although nothing explicit as usual with Heyer their relationship is one of the most sensual and emotionally moving of any of her protagonists. One of my favourite Heyer books along with Frederica and Sylvester.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|It's always nice to see someone in Hollywood take chances and move outside normal filming practices. Although CLOVERFIELD isn't wholly original, it does have an original feel thanks to the incredibly myopic look the audience gets via its length through one camera lens.<br /><br />Labeled as [[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]] meets [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]], Cloverfield definitely incorporates portions of both but comes out the other end as its own animal.<br /><br />The myopic view was seen, as stated earlier, in The Blair Witch Project, which had a handheld camera being buoyed around by an amateur film maker, allowing the viewer to get up-close and personal with the story. With Cloverfield, we get the same experience but with a bit more high-tech status along the way. New York skyscrapers crumble and explode. The head of lady liberty comes hurtling down the street. The Brooklyn Bridge gets twisted and ripped apart like tissue paper. And the \\"monster\\" causing all this ...well ...you'll have to see that for yourself. I will say, however, that it was nice to only get glimpses of the creature and its `offspring' since that is the way it would truly happen if viewed through one person's eyes.<br /><br />Which brings us to the Godzilla aspects of the film. Japan has that monster, and J.J. Abrams ([[ASIN:B00005JNOG Lost]]) gives us a new American one here. Unique is size, shape, and color, this new beast is just as tough to kill as Godzilla and has many smaller monsters (about the size of a regular dog) that it sheds like lice. And you don't want to get bitten by one of these lice; trust me! The more unique and intriguing thing about this new creature is that we know nothing about it since the story is all coming from one herky-jerky camera lens. Alien? Radioactive giant? Government experiment gone wrong? Who knows. This added to the realism of the story.<br /><br />Although I understand the need for character development, I felt that the opening 20 minutes dragged on a bit too long. The love story between Jason (Mike Vogel, [[ASIN:B000EMGICS Rumor Has It]]) and Beth (Odette Yustman, [[ASIN:B000VR0570 Transformers]]) added to the story in the end but was overly forced upon us in the beginning (\\"We get it! They're in love already!\\")<br /><br />Two other notable items must be mentioned. The first is the realism of the camera movements and the klutzy guy who carries it named Hudd (comedian T.J. Miller). Although why he continued to carry it sometimes bordered on ludicrous, his dopey demeanor helped make this easier to swallow. The second item is the sound quality. Absolutely amazing! The thumps, bumps, and explosions were an awesome thing to hear, and the dolby digital sound quality really shone through.<br /><br />Certainly something to watch on a big screen TV with a great sound system.

B0015D3Z4O|3.0|While this is no Confessions On A Dance Floor this happens to be a good album. I only liked a few tracks and I feel like some of the other songs relyed too much on sound instead of making it more dance beats then \\"pop\\" beats. Since their is no choice I prefered for her to stick to the pop beats then anything ballad like. It is suggested to listen to the album before you purchase so that way you feel more confident. I would def recommend this album. If your a hard core fan go get it! :)
B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is an interesting album because it captures the turning point of Pink Floyd.  The music contains the mysterious innovation and creativity of A Saucerful of Secrets (with some Kinks influences) but it *sounds* more like the laidback, bombastic Dark Side-era period of the band.    I personally don't understand where ANY of the complaints are coming from that mention the album is loaded with too much pointless noodling.  Where?  Oh, you mean the sounds of bacon frying in a pan (with all the pops and cracks of the meat smoking- hey, that kind of precise detail is pretty darn cool!)    Well I have news for you- that particular sound can only be heard in the final track (in the beginning of \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\") and that's about it folks as far as the \\"pointless noodling and effects\\" are concerned.  The rest of the album is dominated with highly enjoyable, listenable and creative musical ideas.      Track one, the title song (with its many various themes) is nearly 24 minutes long, and what exactly can you expect from THIS magnificent song?  Besides sounding totally mysterious like a dark cloud is about to cover over the entire planet, it features such musical instruments as violins, keyboard swirls, dreamy/creepy guitar parts, loud and exciting drumming, and a female choir.  Each theme blends perfectly into the next one.     After THAT gigantic piece of beauty is over, you are then about to experience the softer, more pop/rock melodic side of the band.  Do you like that song \\"Mother\\" from the Wall?  If the answer is yes, then \\"If\\", \\"Summer of '68\\" and \\"Fat Old Sun\\" are certainly similar to that song in terms of melody and quiet atmosphere.  However, \\"Mother\\" doesn't contain as much creativity by way of instrumental variety that these three tracks do.  Listen carefully behind the vocal melodies and focus on each musical instrument.  The music is so creative on this album you can just fall in love with what's going on in the background.    The final track features incredibly beautiful guitar lines that slowly (but excitedly) drift and drift and DRIFT some more, and some good piano playing in the beginning.      Simply put, a very colorful album all around.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm simply expecting way too much out of movies these days.    From scene to scene, I excitedly awaited for the movie to FINALLY get going. The extremely lengthy character development ultimately proved to be utterly pointless filler.  Aside from some refreshing special effects and military coverage, all I got were letdowns. With such incredible special effects, particularly the military dealing with the creature (and the creature(s) themselves), I cannot believe how stupid that movie was. That's why I have dubbed it \\"The Blair Godzilla Project\\" - a bunch of nothing leading up to a nothing ending.  Even worse, this movie can be mercilessly picked apart.  I'll only mention a few things:    1. Virtually zero originality in the movie.    2.  WAY too much lame character development (utterly useless filler), way too little of why people went to see the movie.     3.  Another brainless \\"everybody freaks out because nobody's older than 30\\" movie.     Those are just the minor flaws.  Here's a few to really sink teeth into:    Major Hit 1a:  I want to know what brand of video camera that annoying, needing-to-be-punched buffoon was holding. Any camera that can be dropped multiple times, including from about 300 feet (the headless cameraman scene near the end) and still continue to maintain perfect digital clarity at a professional camera level - but affordable enough for 20-somethings to buy them for recording beer bashes - I definitely want one.    Major Hit 1b:  ATTENTION HOLLYWOOD:  We're sick of \\"jerky camera\\"!  Put the camera back in the hands of a professional, please.  Or at least recognize the fact that today's kids are experts at using handheld technology such as video cameras.  \\"Different\\" isn't always progress or good.  Sometimes it sucks.  Watching an entire movie where you're virtually unable to focus your eyes or get a good look at ANYTHING is beyond frustrating.  All that wasted money on effects you never get to see more than aglimpse of is just tragic.  What a loss to the work the special effects team did and what a loss to the audience.    Major Hit 2:  Stupid scenes galore. For example, as the military is bombing the creature via B-2 Stealth Bomber, the presumably preoccupied creature (preoccupied with getting bombed) jumps up out of the blast cloud and takes a snap not at the B-2 bomber, but at the harmless camera in the harmless helicopter they're flying in overhead. Yeah, that's remotely plausible and makes sense.  Or the headless cameraman scene - out of an entire city where the creature has been rampaging all night with the US military swarming around it the entire time, the creature just happens to annoyingly and repetitively (and even QUIETLY) pop up on their location and take them by surprise while the military \\"loses\\" the 300-foot creature long enough for nearly the entire ending of the movie to unfold.    Major hit 3:  The greatest failure of the movie was the dropped ball on the smaller spider creatures, which were actually taken straight out of \\"Starship Troopers\\" with virtually zero alteration to avoid plagiarism (one of my all time favorite movies that begged to have a sequel made and never got one). I got really excited when I saw them, thinking the movie was FINALLY about to get much better. They had a GREAT creep factor, especially the \\"bitten girl exploding\\" scene. WAY cool. Though the movie overall is extremely unoriginal, there were still some opportunities to really jazz the movie up and get it moving, the spider creatures being the biggest.  But alas, the letdowns continued and the smaller spider creatures simply disappeared for the rest of the movie.  Poof - gone.  Stupid.  One dropped ball after another.    Major Hit 4:  That ending. Egad.  My wife and I, huge sci-fi connesseurs, were stunned at the lame ending.  I dont require the good guys to win at the end, but a whole movie full of nothing only to wind up with a nothing ending that was a shamelessly obvioussetup for a sequel is downright unacceptable. The end actually left us sitting there looking at each other with our jaws hanging open in disbelief. \\"You're kidding!\\"  I can't see how this movie isn't insulting to any thinking human being. This is where it REALLY turned into the Blair Godzilla Project, same exact ending as Blair Witch. I cannot believe the ZERO-originality factor of this movie compared to how many people are impressed by it.  With movie audiences so easily fooled, I should be working as a writer in Hollywood.  Just by not ripping off other movies, I'd be hailed as the new Speilberg and would be best friends with M. Night Shyamalan.    The most aggrivating part for me is bittersweet, so I can't list it as a major hit because it's based on what they got right.  That is, all the filmmaking elements to make this movie absolutely fantastic were there! SO CLOSE to getting it right!  This is hugely frustrating.  The special effects were stunning, the creature itself was fantastic, the realism of the destruction was beautifully done, and even the acting was actually very good (despite my disgust over wimpy/weepy male roles, but I have to remind myself that the movie is about NYC yuppies). And the military scenes were top-notch incredible. EXTREMELY realistic, in fact, something most sci-fi movies totally fail at (like the recent \\"War Of The Worlds\\", which is downright insulting to anybody in the military that's actually seen combat). What they got right in this movie was stunningly right.  What they got wrong is what's tragic, because it's so overwhelmingly wrong that it ruins the movie.    The concept of a Godzilla theme is so overwhelmingly cool that it is regularly re-attempted at least once every decade.  This movie is just the latest attempt.  Huge progress was made, but combined with huge mistakes.  It could have reighned supreme as the mother of all Gozilla movies.  Sadly, it's yet another blown opportunity to get it right and yet another movie to throw into my \\"yet another failed Godzilla attempt\\" pile.    At least this one wasn't a liberalized \\"misunderstood homeless pregnant mommy\\" Godzilla who just needed to lay her eggs all over NYC.  I would have put the remote through the screen.
B000002VCT|5.0|Such an underappreciated rock band Alan Parsons Project were.  When you take simple vocal melodies, and combine them with brilliant and meaningful lyrics, you've created a winning formula with a perfect listening experience.  That's what this band did- everything, including this Pyramid album, is meaningful, beautiful, pleasant and extremely listenable.  I'd find it hard to believe someone would hate this band.  Seriously, this is some really good stuff released in the late 70's that many people have forgotten about as the years have gone by.
B0000C9JFO|4.0|One of very few times I've laughed outloud at a movie... A different sense of humor is required. Highly recommend.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|this band is my current favourite, because of the song hermod's ride to hel. it doesn't matter what mood i'm in, when i hear that song... it feels like i'm soaring inside. the awesomeness, it fills me. i love the instrumentals. sometimes i focus only one the instruments and block out the voices because they just... sing to me, for lack of better phrase :P but i also enjoy the vocals. as opposed to other, similar kinds of music, i find the vocals to be oddly clear... in a gutteral sort of way (if you listen to death metal/ other gutteral stuff, you'll know what i mean) its almost relaxing. but yes, hermod's ride to hel is my absolute favourite song right now, everything in that one clicks for me, but the other songs are good too. great album
B0000640VO|5.0|Favorite movie of all time... one you can watch over and over. It's like taking a trip to France all over again, but with a quirkly little love story.
1552091090|5.0|i have loved this book ever since i was young. its a story about unconditional love, how a parent will forever love their children no matter what they do or how old they get or how far away they move. after reading some of the other reviews, i have to say that there is nothing incestuous or morally disturbing about the book. it is about a mother's undying love for her son (this is not in the romantic sense). in fact i think you would have to be sick to warp something so innocent into something so twisted. is unconditional love so rare in society that a person cannot distinguish it from sexual love? must EVERYTHING revolve around sex? i don't know how disconnected some people are to their parents, or if they ever see their grandparents, but having a close family that care enough about you to take an active role in your life is a good thing. when i grow older i won't stop talking to my mother... in fact i may even give her a key to my house so that she may visit me whenever she wishes to do so, even if i live on the other side of town. she will wish to visit me because she cares about me and always will. what i think the more critical reviewers fail to grasp is that this is a story for children, meaning that if an author wants to convey an idea... like i'll love you forever, he'll do so in a way a child can understand. this can of course be twisted by people who watch too much news and are afraid of emotional contact. the sad thing is when the children start picking up on the adult's dirty mental processes and look at this story about how much a mother loves her baby, and sees something bad.<br />and as for the mother's death at the end of the book... this is not a terrifying way for a child to experience death (hopefully not for the first time). death is very much a part of life. all people will die eventually, which is something all people (even the small ones) must come to understand. and people face death every day of their lives. how do parents explain where hamburgers come from? i'm not advocating to brutally educate your children, i am only suggesting that keeping children ignorant of the basic facts of life is not helping them. if you can't talk to them about death (or for that matter, love between a mother and child), how are you going to talk to them about drugs and abusive relationships?<br />anyways, this is a touching, heart-warming story that should be enjoyed by all the people who can get their hands on it ^_^rs come from? i'm not advocating to brutally educate your children, i am only suggesting that keeping children ignorant of the basic facts of life is not helping them. if you can't talk to them about death (or for that matter, love between a mother and child), how are you going to talk to them about drugs and abusive relationships?   anyways, this is a touching, heart-warming story that should be enjoyed by all the people who can get their hands on it ^_^
1400079179|5.0|Favorite book of all time... followed by Angels & Demons... Brown's work is genius, and could make anyone question their own beliefs.
B0001HAISG|5.0|i have loved peter pan ever since i was a child. it is a wonderful story about magic and freedom and the wonder of childhood, and i believe that this movie did an excellent job of capturing those themes and bringing them alive. there was the added love interest in the movie, that was kind of suggested in the book, but never stated. many times when movies deviate from the original plot in anyway its usually a major disappointment for those who fell in love with the original, but in this case the deviation was very well done and added greatly to the over all effect of the film. this movie is an enchanting retelling of a beloved classic and a must own for all lovers of peter pan!!!
1593974760|4.0|There are a number of books in the Ender Series: first was Ender's Game, a short story turned into a worthy novel by sci-fi master Orson Scott Card. Ender, battleschool graduate, has eliminated an entire race of beings (The \\"Buggers\\"--really the Hive Queen and her subjects.) Now, whispered to by the cocoon of the hive queen he has rescued, Ender is moving away from Earth, banished by the decision of his brother Peter and Colonel Graff, to live on Lusitania.<br /><br />Lusitania is an odd colony living behind a palisade to avoid contaminating the aboriginal life--and also to protect the colonists from murder by the Piggies, their name for the native life form there. After a disturbing execution of first one of the Piggies then a colonist or two, Ender arrives, invited to be a Speaker for the Dead. He is not exactly welcome in this tight little community, but he persists, knowing that his role on Lusitania is far greater than any of the colonists can imagine.<br /><br />The audio version of this book is far better than the written, and that applies for the others in this part of the series (Xenocide.) I thought this was an abberation, but Orson Scott Card himself said in an interview that his experiences with being a playwright lead him to write dialog-based scenes.  He feels his books are meant to be read aloud. I have to concur; two books of his I didn't like in printed form I admire greatly in audio form. This is one of them.<br /><br />If you find \\"Xenocide\\" or \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" hard going, I suggest you get the audio edition. As to the \\"Shadow\\" series of sequels, for some reason, these read well in printed form but are just fine as audio as well. I have to agree with the author, his books are meant to be heard!
B000EULJLU|5.0|i've always liked tool, but this album was... different. some songs were almost transcendental. some of the songs really make you slow down, or even stop what you're doing or thinking about and just listen. the prime example of this for me on this cd was lost keys. that song isn't just a song... its an experience. it's like, the listener is in the head of someone who is lost, confused, scared and lonely. it was brilliant how they got the doctors to talk over the music to the 'main character', but the music over powers their words with the over bearing emotion so that while you hear the words, you don't care about them, because the voices don't care about you and don't understand what you're going through. they just want to 'deal with you' and get you out of there. ... it gets me every time. but its good. vicarious is another good one. if not buy the cd, make sure you listen to some songs (in my opinion the ones i mentioned hold the highest priority, of course).
0670018651|1.0|As someone who collects perfumes, appreciates the art of sniffing, and reads up on olfactive memories and emotions, I find this book a complete joke. For one thing, if `The Guide' thinks that it can get away with pithy two-lined reviews which really say nothing about the perfume at all, the authors must be dreaming. While I acknowledge that perfumery is an art form and hence subjective -- allowing the authors to write their opinions on it -- I don't understand some of these sloppily written reviews which really say nothing at all about a scent; it's structure, the notes, the history, the bottle among other things. The intention of the authors may be a wonderful one -- to get industry players to wake up, get their acts together and be more serious in the field where just anyone has a perfume to his/her name -- I wonder however if skimpy reviews like `sad shampoo' would help anyone (in the field, or perfume lovers or collectors) in any way. What is even more painful is that while the authors acknowledge that `perfume is an art', the book contradicts this entire premise. For one thing, the mocking tones don't contribute anything to anyone's pre-existing knowledge on perfumes.     This book appears to be a lame exercise in witty prose writing, more than attempting to describe a smell well. Unless your patterns of buying and collecting are based on one or two people's reviews such as these (the true aficionado tests everything and decides for himself/herself and wears anything which pleases him/her), I'd highly recommend that you put your money elsewhere.
0385334206|5.0|this was my first vonnegut book, but it certainly won't be the last. this was a wonderful book on free will and how we choose to see the world and our ever eternal fight against cynisism. i think that an important point to keep in mind is that there is a reason and purpose behind every passage he has written, they all connect back to one of the larger points he makes. its cynical, but not a depressing cynical, a cynical that makes you take a closer look. i would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. its one of the great reads of our time. philosiphical, satirical, and wonderful. definitely check it out
B00013RC8O|5.0|So many phenominal reviews, covering so rightly the deeply moving existential message, accidentally delivered by Newman, Sarafian and Alonzo.  One thing everybody missed... is at the end, the light Kowalski's chasing is not the sun, but the Son... of God. This is, after everything else, a Gospel Film...  about freedom, the REAL kind!
B000GFLE1S|5.0|i love this movie. lola's such a flamboyant character that stands up to all of the crap people give her and keeps on going. she has such a strength of character that i guess i want to see from someone facing such adversity. gender identity is such a delicate issue for some and i'm glad that there are such main stream movies as this that address the issue. its a really touching movie and its both feel good and sad... if that makes sense, but i enjoy watching it every time its on.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've been enjoying a pair of [[ASIN:B00001WRSJ MDR-V6]]'s for the past 7 or so years at the office and was in the market for a pair of comparable headphones for use at home.  The MDR-7506's live up to the high expectations set by the MDR-V6's and are even more comfortable for me as the cut out in the pads is larger on the MDR-7506's than the MDR-V6's.<br /><br />Both sets are very comfortable for extended wear and provide incredible sound reproduction at very low device volumes.  The high's are crisp and bright and the low end is pronounced but not over processed or muddy.  They also give a fair amount of isolation from the environment, further reducing the need to crank the volume to enjoy your music.  They work especially nicely in an office environment as they do not allow much sound to seep out and when taken off, the pads naturally sit against one another blocking out almost all sound for a quick walk away from the desk without annoying those around you.<br /><br />The headband on these is very forgiving and very comfortable, I tried a pair of Senn's at the store which were comparable in price and sound quality but even at the largest setting they felt like a vice on my temple - these Sony's have sufficient pivot points and give to be very comfortable from the very first use.
B000008M1P|5.0|This review, originally posted in 2008, has been revised in view of the recent death of founder and lead guitarist Jan Kuehnemund.   Vixen was one of the first all-female bands to achieve major success in the hard rock world.  Stylistically, Vixen ranged from playing Journey-like power ballads to harder-edged, glam metal.  This, their first album was mellower.  The 11 tracks were penned in part by the band, in part by other musicians, so that at times the writing seems a bit inconsistent. Still, there is quite a bit of strong material on the CD.  The melodies are catchy, the instrumental work is solid with engaging hooks, and the vocal harmonies are almost a guilty pleasure.  Vixen was an underrated band, and their music holds up well three decades later.    Listeners who enjoy this album may also like their second, Rev It Up, from 1990.
B0006Z2KXE|1.0|The Philadelphia Story is pure garbage. People and critics have always raved about this movie so I decided to watch it and see for myself, to my utter disbelief this film is nonsense. The plot is childish and goes nowhere and the non-stop talking drove me insane 30 minutes in. Jeez Katharine Hepburn never shuts her big fat mouth, talk, talk, talk! James Stewart is pretty good but he didn't deserve the Oscar. This film is for whiny, spoiled upper-middle class nutcases! I hate it sorry but I can't pretend this is cinema art.
B0000075WM|5.0|This review, originally posted in 2008, is being updated in the wake of the untimely death of founding member and lead guitarist Jan Kuehnemund, who succumbed to cancer in 2013.  Vixen was one of the first all-female bands to achieve major success in the hard rock, glam metal genre.   Originally released in 1990, Rev it Up, their second album, is here presented on a remastered CD.   The album contains a nice mix of guitar-driven hard rock and power ballads featuring keyboard arrangements.  The songwriting here was consistently strong, with nice melodic themes, tasteful guitar leads and hooks, and smooth vocal harmonies.   There is no weak material on this CD.    Highly recommended for fans of 1980s metal.
0792846443|4.0|Misery starring Kathy Bates and James Caan is ultra creepy. Based on Stephan King's novel and directed by Rob Reiner this thriller will have you shaking in your boots. Bates is truly terrifying as \\"the fan\\" no wonder she won the Oscar! Caan has never been better, you can't help feel pity for the guy. Definitely one to watch, I highly recommend it!
B000654YRY|5.0|Just stunning even after all these years.  Shame Sultans of Swing isn't there, but the rest definitely make up for it.  If you saw this show over a decade ago, it'll bring back great memories.
B0009X7664|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a Hollywood classic. This is Gregory Peck's signature role, he won an Oscar for Best Actor. He is flawless, gental, and humble in the role of lawyer Atticus Finch. I think this film is better than the book which was written by Harper Lee. I love and admire this movie, has a meaningful message and a timeless story. I highly recommend this treasure, enjoy!
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Definitely a 'must have' if you're a Celine Dion fan.  We saw this show live in Las Vegas and the 'extra' DVD gave a fantastic insight into all the work and effort that goes on backstage.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|A Beautiful Mind is a good film but not brilliant. Russell Crowe does a fine job as College professor John Nash but the real magic performance goes to Jennifer Connelly, she is truly amazing as Nash's understanding wife. Ron Howard is a fantastic director but this film is probably is most flawed. A Beautiful Mind is an important film but it left me disappointed.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Do yourself a favor and preview her very first album right here on Amazon and you'll here what I'm talikng about.  I hadn't listened to that album since I was in high school, and regretably, I had forgotten the sound, feel and essence of it.  Basically, take that first album and fast forward to 2008, throw some techno and hip hop onto it, and you've got Hard Candy.      Anything wrong with that??? Heck no! This album is really awesome (with a few flaws just like her first one).  Does anyone ever hum along to \\"I know It\\"?  Doubt it.  Same things goes with Spanish Lesson on this album.     Is this album deep? No!    Full of hit singles that will stand the test of time? YES! (ie, Give it 2 me, Incredible, Heartbeat).  Classic Madonna. YES!      Leave it no Madonna to reference herself and then take it farther.      HEY MADONNA....THANKS FOR THE THE TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE.  HOW ABOUT ANOTHER \\"RAY OF LIGHT\\"?  PRETTY PLEASE?
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|That's what its all about...THE MUSIC.     I feel that everyone has been very critical of \\"[[ASIN:B0015D3Z4O Hard Candy]]\\" since she announced that she was working with Timbaland and J. Timberlake. This album has been called everything from a Nelly Furtado reject to a desperate attempt to gain American fame (again). Hard Candy may not be \\"Madonna\\", \\"Like A Prayer\\" or \\"Music\\" but its  not a bad album. In fact, it's one of the best albums Madonna has produced this decade.     The album opens with CANDY SHOP. Madonna invites you to enjoy what lies ahead. \\"Candy Shop\\" reminds me of Dress You Up both musically and lyrically. The party begins and the horns of 4 MINUTES triumphantly sound. If you're not on the floor by now, YOU ARE.     Next you slide into GIVE IT 2 ME. Get stupid and show Madonna what you're made of. Next, you beat into Heartbeat. To me, this is \\"Into the Groove\\" and \\"Music\\" combined. It's all about the music to Madonna, its her core! Watch Madonna \\"get her booty down!\\"     The mid-tempo MILES AWAY is next. When I think of this gem, I hear Kylie's \\"The One\\" in the background. Maybe the guy Madonna's singing about is the one for Kylie??? Great single material and will probably be Madonna's 13th #1 in the States. If you stopped at the bar, you're back on the floor for SHE\\"S NOT ME. I LOVE how people think this song is about Britney Spears (ROFL). I'd pay to see Britney steal Guy Ritchie :). I love the breakdown of this song (this will defiantly have you jumping around the room).  This track was placed perfectly after \\"Miles Away\\". Only problem is its a tad bit too long. Should have been cut around 3:30.    INCREDIBLE is just a feel good song that will put you in a GOOD mood. You brought from your high by the drums of BEAT GOES ON. A great improvement from the leaked version. The track is very reminiscent of her first album. Kanye brings an extra \\"umph\\" to the track. DANCE 2NIGHT is a good throwback, 80's song, however, its just hard for me to get into the song. Very good the first 3-5 listens but after that its just seems dull and doesn't belong with the rest of the album. Take a break and go the restroom on this track.     SPANISH LESSON brings you back to the floor with its hard guitar opening. Reminds of \\"Eso Beso\\" for some reason. This is my 2nd favorite \\"Latin-theme\\" Madonna song behind \\"La Isla Bonita\\". I can see Madonna as a naughty teacher disciplining her pupil for  poor test grade. The night takes a somber turn with DEVIL WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU. Joe Henry (musician and Madonna's brother-in-law) is not only an amazing artist but a GREAT songwriter. He co-wrote \\"Don't Tell Me\\". \\"Devil...\\" is not necessarily a ballad but a very sad song. It's message deals with abuse of some sort (my guess is spousal).     The night ends with VOICES, Madonna's most haunting and personal track to date. Very similar to \\"Drowned World\\" where Madonna places her reality against her fame. I feel that this song is about her fans. There are some who are loyal and will stick with you but then there are others who only want to come along for the ride when you're doing what they want. Who is the master and who is the slave?    Track by Track Rating    2 STARS  Dance 2Night    3 STARS  She's Not Me    4 STARS  Beat Goes On  Incredible  4 Minutes  Spanish Lesson  Give It 2 Me    5 STARS  Candy Shop  Heartbeat  Devil Wouldn't Recognize You  Voices  Miles Away
B000YJ85VS|4.0|Basically the entire concept can be expressed in two words: Human Element.  But those of you who prefer a little more verbosity with a tiny smithering of grandiosity will enjoy Predictably Irrational.  My only regret is that I purchased the print edition rather than the Kindle, now when I wish to quote from it; I need to bring the book with me.
B000063UR1|1.0|The worst movie, very slow with a poor acting. Unless your a greenpeace nut don't bother.......
B00005BJ9W|5.0|There's no question about it, Rio is their finest work to date. For me, it's tied for first with Astronaut. This album has got all the right sounds and all the right moves. You can't mention Duran Duran without bringing up \\"Rio\\" or \\"Hungry like the Wolf\\" or those classic videos that we still can't seem to get over.    Of course, this album isn't complete without the memorable \\"Rio\\" and \\"Hungry like the Wolf,\\" true songs that define an era, all new wave, all 80s. There's also the deep and harmonious \\"Save a Prayer\\" which also is fun listen and another classic. Let's not forget upbeat rockers \\"Hold back the rain\\" and \\"New Religion,\\" some of their best, the smooth and seductive, \\"Chauffer\\" the funky \\"My own way\\" melodic \\"Lonely in your Nightmare\\" and \\"Last chance on the stairway,\\" one of my personal favorites. There's not one song you can dislike.      I truly do enjoy this album, it's fantastic from beginning to end. As you can see: Pretty looking guys+cool music+memorable singles=1 Phenomenal band. Rio got them noticed here in the states and launched them into history. And now, they're among icons. Every Duran Duran fan must have this album, newcomer and life-long alike!
0439813786|2.0|This book, the delicious heft of it, the wonderful pictures, lead up to an ending that while curious, and historically significant, is written so flatly that all the magic is gone.  Too bad.  What a disappointment.
0375842209|1.0|I got to page 267 after two months.  I am usually a fast reader, but this made me fall asleep every time I started reading.  Good story, but boring!  I would compare it to \\"running in sand!\\"  One does advance, but with tremendous effort.  Too bad, I usually like stories from WWII.
B00154GEFU|5.0|The return of Asia is here!!! One word for this CD.... STUNNING! This CD I have had for 24 hours and can already say its very close to being the BEST one yet (No no guys... still holding the self titled one first, dont get in a hissie)! BUT THIS CD IS SIMPLY INCREDIBLE! Dont take my word for it... just check the reviews. Do yourself a favor, get yourself a little taste of this beauty by listening to a sample of \\"Never Again\\".   Now the sick part... Most likely this will not hit the radio. Which is COMPLETE highway robbery. But hey... At least I can turn on the radio and hear the B side of some idiot band, whos trying to get themselves out of a one hit wonder jam...   PEOPLE!!! DONT PASS THIS ONE BY!!!
0679736646|3.0|If you're new to Philip K. Dick, then I can't recommend [[ASIN:B000OP7V9Y UBIK]] as a place to get to know him.  Start with one of his inventive SciFi operas ([[ASIN:0345404475 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]] or [[ASIN:0679736662 The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]), his psychological conundrums ([[ASIN:0679741143 Confessions of a Crap Artist]] or [[ASIN:B000PGHY9O A SCANNER DARKLY]]), his cold-war farces (The [[ASIN:B000J2Q4UO Zap Gun]] or The Simulacrum), or any of his fun short story collections.<br /><br />If you're familiar with Dick, you'll find that UBIK displays all of his hallmarks.  1) A what-if concept that is too simple for any other author to invent: in this case a corp of anti-psi characters who are in high demand because their ultra-mundane presence blocks psychic interference.  2) Hapless male protagonists controlled by feminine mystique.  3) Thurber-style humor, such as talking coin-op household appliances.  And 4) exploration of the borderline personality.  In this case, the borderline personality takes over the book as each character fades to a figment of another's imagination and reality itself is revealed to be the product of a spray can.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|On YouTube I recently saw a video of Steve Jobs demoing the Apple Macintosh in 1984.  This product received huge accolades for its innovation - it defined for the first time many of the PC interfaces and features we take for granted now.  Even Bill Gates was a fan!<br /><br />But anyone looking at it now would wonder what all the fuss was about. Similarly, those of us who are interested but perhaps not dedicated students of film (including myself), can come away from the Seven Samurai wondering the same.<br /><br />But this movie is the equivalent of the Apple Mac - innovative and brilliantly designed.  For example his approach to shot composition, use of telephoto, character development and action scenes were all truly innovative at the time and set the standard for generations of film-makers.<br /><br />Problem is, these innovations have been studied, directly copied, imitated and further developed over the past 50+ years.  As a result, it is somewhat challenging to fully appreciate what a truly great and ground-breaking movie this was at the time
B000009HF2|5.0|This album is amazing.  I'm only 23, so this music is way before my time (I never even heard of Peter Frampton until 2005).  I kept hearing it's one of the best selling live albums ever, and after hearing it, it's for a darn good reason.  The production quality is crystal clear, the songs are classics, and it's just a blast to listen to over and over!  Everyone should own this album for it truly stands the test of time.
B00000264F|1.0|Everybody remembers \\"The Final Countdown\\" by Europe and that's about it. There is good reason for that. Europe stumbled upon a great keyboard riff, and used it to maximum effect on \\"The Final Countdown\\", the keyboard riff sold the song.<br />Unfortunately on \\"Wings of Tomorrow\\" you don't get a cool keyboard riff, and while the music isn't bad, anytime lead singer Joey Tempest opens his mouth the songs are ruined. Tempest's vocals have all of the edge and rock quality of Michael Bolton. So while the guitar work is pretty decent, Tempest begins his \\"ooohhhs\\" and \\"ahhhhhs\\" and immediately makes the songs annoying, you will get douche chills for certain. I can't imagine paying more than $2 for this disk, and that would be for the instrumental \\"Aphasia\\"...but even that isn't all that great, but to pay over $20 for this disk is a complete waste of money.
B00122M2QU|4.0|It's great to see Max and his brother back together and making music.  The Cavalera Conspiracy album is excellent and what we expect from Max.  Heavy, Fast and full of great percussion and Metal!<br /><br />Stop reading this and go pick it up RIGHT NOW!
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|if you are expecting more of the same as what they've done on their previous albums you might end up disappointed with this one. Third is definitely a different direction for Portishead, but i don't think that is a bad thing. though they might have alienated some of their long time fans with this release, i think they will actually gain some new ones in the process.     i've been a fan of the band from the start, but ihonestly didn't have very high expectations for this album. coming back after 10 or so years to drop another masterpiece album just seemed so unlikely to me. but on first listen, Third was the absolute most refreshing album i have heard in years. i hear elements of Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd freak psyche, the Krautrock electronic groove of bands like Silver Apples, a little Industrial and a minimal amount of the usual Trip Hop flavor that we are used to hearing from Portishead.     even if you've never expressed any interest in Portishead before, i encourage anyone who is into Psychedelic music to give this album a good listen.     cheers!
B00005JPSM|1.0|Skip this one and rent \\"Mostly Martha\\" instead - bite the bullet, read the subtitles.  It's worth it. \\"Without Reservation\\" is, without reservation, only a shallow imitation of the superb German film, starring the stellar Martina Gedeck (The Lives of Others). Together, with a equally great supporting cast, the story comes alive, not forced or contrived. \\"Without Reservation\\" does little or nothing to engage the viewer except maybe for the palate.

1582701709|3.0|Regardless if you buy into the entire approach, there are some common themes of life that are found in books such as The Celestine Prophecy.  The Secret puts a twist.  Regardless, it's a refreshing approaching and easy read to communicate how changing one's perspective and outlook toward the positive end of the spectrum will diminish the negative energy and results.  The secret is how to get the world to use the secret to get the right politicians in office and oust the rest.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Well, it's been eleven years since Portishead's last studio album, but it's finally here. The aptly named third album, Third, is about as satisfying as albums get. It's hauntingly beautiful and wholly representative of what Portishead is capable of. Far from falling behind the rest of the music scene in the last decade, the band has managed to craft one of the most original-sounding albums I've heard in years.    Who invented trip hop is a matter of debate to some people, but for my two cents, there is no argument about who defined the genre. Massive Attack, Tricky and Portishead. If you think of trip hop as one big Venn diagram, those are the three circles which represent all of trip hop's possibilities and every trip hop act falls somewhere under their influence. It's practically the definition of the genre: A band is a trip hop act if you can put them somewhere in that Venn diagram.    This makes Portishead one of the three pillars of trip hop and their latest album not only cements their already formidable standing in the genre, but it expands the band's sound into uncharted territory and may force other bands to rethink their own conceptions of the scene as a whole.    Beth Gibbons' vocals are amazing--not just like they already were in earlier efforts, but vastly improved. Her voice has clearly changed slightly over the last decade (no surprise) and her range seems to have extended greatly and her control over difficult vocal transitions in songs like We Carry On is truly mind blowing at times.    Utley and Barrow work their characteristic magic as well, Utley contributing exactly what he needs to, nothing more and nothing less, perfect in every way and Barrow pushing the music forward, sometimes relentlessly urgent and pensive in the samples and beats chosen as the musical backdrop. Every element in these songs has been heard before, though not all in Portishead songs, but never have they been arranged quite like they are on Third. Even the band's earlier albums never sounded like this, incorporating elements from industrial, old old school German techno, folksy jazz guitar riffs, and some truly jarring inter-track transitions that feel like you've just been run into a brick wall.    Third is one of the most vaguely unsettling albums to come around in a long time and yet it still feels so good to listen to. At no point does it let you rest and just sit back and fade into the music. The constant sense that you never know what's going to come next always lies just under the surface, drawing you in closer, forcing you to listen attentively waiting for the other shoe to drop. And when it finally does, it's so rewarding that you can't help but listen even closer, waiting for the next surprise. It's like some kind of twisted pavlovian experiment, each reward surpassing the last until the album finally ends, beckoning you to start over from the beginning and go again (and again, and again). The term \\"rewards multiple listens\\" doesn't even begin to describe the complexity of this disc, and yet it seems immediately accessible, enjoyable from the drop of the first beat.    Third is ultimately an exercise in contradictions. It's soulful and mechanical. It's a hauntingly retro throwback that's still painfully cutting edge. It's smooth and jarring, soothing and unsettling. It's uncomfortable and inviting. And throughout it all, it's achingly beautiful. I haven't heard anything like it in years if I've heard anything else like it at all.    The first track, Silence, has got to be the most perfect intro track ever. In five minutes it not only completely encompasses everything Portishead has done before but brings you screaming right through the last ten years of silence and straight into Portishead's new sound. It's like a recursive acronym with the recursive, self-descriptive element at the end of the string. It begins by building on where Portishead left off and then just keeps building and building upon itself until it finally (andrather abrubtly) just stops dead--straight into the next track, Hunter, which picks up some of the band's old torch music sound but tweaks it just enough to sound like no other song you've ever heard. It's a bold proclamation right from the start, \\"Yes, we're back. Yes, we're still Portishead. No, we're not remaking Dummy.\\"    And that's really the only theme throughout the whole album, Portishead is back and better than ever. God only knows what's going on under the surface here. The band is only slightly less reclusive this time around (every publicity shot I've seen of Beth still captures her looking at the ground and nowhere near the camera) so explanations are scarce. It's so experimental as to be almost opaque and yet it's so damn good that you can't help but keep listening and trying, always trying to figure out what it all means. Absolutely amazing. I only wish they were touring the US right now and not Europe so I could see them perform some of the new material live.

1402714580|2.0|Little Women is very like The Brady Bunch. In its time, everybody knew it was sugary-sweet and unrealistic. (Including, and especially, Alcott.) It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo. (For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)    The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not.  She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs.  If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.    Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed.
0805079831|1.0|Unlike Naomi Klein who is Canadian I was born and raised in Argentina (were i lived for the past 30 years).    In regards to my countrys experience during it´s last dictartorship, Naomi Klein has embraced what in Argentina is often called as \\"the Official Lie\\". This is, the dominant dogma imposed by the leftist (now in power) propaganda, that maintains that the decline of our country began the 24 of March of 1976 at hands of a dictartorship who took control of the country and imposed through blood and fire a \\"neoliberal model\\". For Klein this has been the ultimate goal of the dictatorship (and the \\"reasons\\" behind the \\"dissapeared\\").     These are fairy tails propagated by the left propaganda machinery (which is admirable). But nothing could be far from the truth.    The assumption of the military dictatorship in the year 76´ did not take place through a violent assault of political power (there was no a single shot fired) but like an \\"agreement\\" between the whole political arc and the military \\"cupulas\\". The first impelled the military to \\"take control\\" due to its incapacity to remove the country from the economic and social chaos in which it was submerged.    From Ricardo Balbín (representing \\"radicalismo\\" o \\"UCR\\"...the other major political party besides \\"Partido Justicialista\\" o \\"Peronismo\\"), to Lorenzo Miguel (representing the sindicalists), to the own Peronists party (whom they didnt´s want to throw the widow of Perón as a last resort through a political judgment)...thay all requested the militarys to taker over . This \\"feeling\\" was shared by major part (not all) of the Argentine society.    The context in which the military cupula emerged was devastating: inflation, shortages (after several months of price controls), prohibitions of meat consumes, ungovernability and a bloody civil war initiated by Marxist terrorism several years ago. The eight (8) Ministers that occupied the Economic Chair in the last year and a half of the Isabel Perón´s administration is just an example of the dramatic economic collapse that was sinking the country down to anarchy.    A fundamental and crucial point to understand \\"why\\" the main political actors had requested and begged the military cupula to take over, is to understand that Argentina came suffering from late Sixties the violent driving of Marxist terrorism that politicians couldn´t and wouldn´t put to an end (mainly due to incompetence and fear).     Note: The reader can find an analogy to the argentine experience of the 70´s in what´s going on right now with the FARC´s (narco-guerrilla) in Colombia. Note II: The narco-guerrillas are now being supported by the dictator Hugo Chavez and by Naomi Klein aswell (who also support FARC´s, Hugo Chavez and Nazi Evo Morles, this last one advocating \\"Indian supremacy\\"). In Argentina we respond to these situations saying \\"God creates them, and the devil accumulates them\\".    It is necessary to emphasize that this drive by marxist terrorism was being framed at the time within a more general program of armed warfare in all the continent. What was later called the \\"export of the Cuban revolution\\" to the rest of Latin America.    The ultimate goal of the Marxist terrorism that spread through Argentina and great part of Latin America was the taking of the political power (government) by means of guerrilla war. This objective was shaped in the General Declaration of the OLAS gathering (Organización Latinoamiercana de Solidaridad) that took place the 10 of August of 1967 (presided by the very same Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara) where it was settled down that:    \\"The immediate goal of the popular revolution in the continent is the taking of the power by means of the destruction of the bureaucratic-military  apparatus of the state and it´s replacement by the popular guerrillas to change the existing social and economic regime. This objective is only attainable through the armed warfare \\". More ahead this document also maintains that: \\"the guerrilla war, as genuine expression of the popular armed warfare, is the most effective method and the best form to wage war and to develop revolutionary war in most of our countries and consequently, in continental scale\\".    I didn´t read Naomi complaining about this \\"shock\\" treatment. It would be interesting to read Noami´s comments about this model imposition by our leftist camaradas.     This drive by marxist terrorism was understandable, since the Armed Forces were the only institutional containment to restrain the revolutionary outpost. Once the military apparatus was destroyed the taking of the political power occurred in addition (something obvious, since ¿what other institution besides the military could stop the advance of these armed groups?).    (I belive...)These data is sufficient to understand two crucial points of the phenomenon thas was the \\"subversion\\" (guerrilla) in Argentina: (1) that a (civil) war was taking place at the time (of revolutionary character and on continental scale), and (2) that the aggresion was first initiated by such guerrilla detachments as a previous step towards its objective of taking of the political power (by means of the armed warfare) to impose the \\"socialist or colectivist nirvana\\".    This is the context in which the Armed Forces assumed the political power in Argentina in 1976.     The military repression was an institutional answer (preceded by presidential decrees) to deal with the phenomenon of revolutionary terrorism and the collapse of political institutions.    The reality is that in Argentina there was no imposition of an economic model. As an example of this statement the own military cupola confessed in several occasions before assuming that they were not prepared to take over since \\"they lacked\\" a government plan. ¿How they could impose an non-existing economic plan?    Finally there is a fundamental point that \\"not-Argentineans\\" readers should take into account (and that serves to show the lies of Naomi Klein):    During the seven years of dictatorship there was not a single privatization of state companies. Zero!    These privatizations were made 17 years later, under a Peronist government and as a consecuence of the economic emergency caused by the monumental fiscal déficits that these companies had accumulated during the government of Alfonsin (83-89), which represented nearly 3.5% of the GDP.    How can Naomi Klein explain us that under the supposed neoliberal model of the 70´s one cannot find not a single privatization of state companies, not a single tax cut, and contrary to her statements the state fiscal deficit has climbed, as much in absolute terms as in % of the GDP (from 2% in 76 to 6% in 82)?    The history of my country shall not be distorted.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Who knew that someone could tie together anime, fantasy, love, and tons of imagination into 125 minutes? Well it was very much possible. I give props out the Miyazaki-san, because this is one of his greatest achievements.<br /><br />First.<br />The characters are wonderfully depicted. The protagonist, Chihiro, has the greatest personality that a twelve year old (I think) could POSSIBLY have. Growing up, I'm guessing, she was probably either spoiled or ignored terribly. And when she's suddenly thrown into this world were she finds that she has to take care of herself, she shapes up. She steps-up to the challenge of surviving in a magical world when she, unconsciously, falls in love with the river spirit, Haku. And vise versa, Haku begins at the other end of the rope and has to learn how to be a child again. Having no memories of who he is or where he came from, Haku is just one emotional blank. And that is what draws Chihiro to him. From the moment they met in the spirit world, she realizes that Haku is always going to be there when she needs him, and all while Haku himself showed immediate concern for her safety and later on doesn't hesitate to help her once she becomes trapped there.<br /><br />Second.<br />The colors and animation blend together so beautifully it is shocking. The movement of the characters, the music and the scenery is depicted so well. If you read it as a book or a manga series, there would be no doubt in your mind that the way the story is portrayed and visualized, would be how you imagined it when you read it.<br /><br />Third.<br />The storyline is amazingly written very well for an animation based film. Love, regret, hopelessness, trust and friendships are just a few of the themes that underline this movie.<br /><br />This is an excellent film, and I recommend it to people of all ages.
B0000E2FLC|1.0|It couldn't be more blatantly obvious that the audio was dubbed over the original recording, if it was even recorded during the actual Donington show at all.  When I watch a concert DVD, I fully expect to see and hear what I would have seen and heard if I had attended the concert.  This experience however, was more like watching a bunch of MTV videos where the audio was from CD versions of the songs, but the video was showing concert footage.  I contemplated giving it two stars instead of one because of Angus' high-energy performance, but the fact that I kept fast-forwarding to the next track during my initial viewing should tell you all you need to know.    The bottom line is that I will most likely never pull this DVD out of the cabinet to watch it again for my own personal enjoyment.  It will only ever see the light of day again if a friend still wants to see it even after the forewarning that I am sure to give.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|For those of us born too late for the initial revolution of Dummy and Portishead, and thus made to play catch up listening to those influential albums years after their release, this album is a blessing. It is not the sound of a band playing catch up or merely attempting to re-create a \\"classic\\" sound previously mastered, but a band interested in creating new types colors in the popular music palate. The structure of these songs are intellectually stimulating while not being too cerebral, there is always emotion put into the work, without sacrificing one for the other. It is a sound that is new, relevant and exciting.     Being the unique work that it is, it is liable to alienate some fans of their previous work. These alienated fans no doubt have placed there own expectations and opinions of what a Portishead album should sound like onto the music before even hearing it. Try listening to it without thinking \\"This is Portishead and it's going to sound like....\\" Putting into that comfortable place in your head where Dummy and Portishead fit so well simply will not due for this album. This album is a much more mature, eclectic sound. It encompasses a wider array of emotional conflict and expression to simply limit it to a preconceived notion.    I am extremely glad and ultimatley surprised to hear how fantastic this album is. It leaves Dummy behind, while not completely forgetting its graces. Like Rsdiohead's \\"The Bends\\" Dummy is certainly a influential time capsule of a sound too imitated by others to be repeated. I am personally glad to hear the hip-hop and scratching behind them.

B000001ESF|5.0|After creating uneven albums and basically just being another hard rock act, Rush finally found their sound as well as their classic formula on 2112.  Bringing in Neil Peart after their first album was the defining move that assured the band success.  Not only is he fantastic on the skins but he writes lyrics that might make Jules Verne proud.    Neil puts out one of his best efforts with 2112, the story of a young man who attempts to win over the corrupt authority of the future.  He finds the best musical instrument ever known to man but even he cannot change the minds of the ruling body.  The tale is very sad and depressing and it is indeed one of the greatest concepts ever put on vinyl.  Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee play their best and even though Lee's voice can be irritating at times, he makes the characters believable and interesting.  The music perfectly complements the story.  When the elders speak the music is furious.  When the young man desperately tries to gain the sympathy of elders, the music is both calm and tense.    Though I admit the rest of the album is basically filler, the tunes here are not without redemption.  They are fun, catchy numbers that allow you to cool off after the workout of the title track.      As far as the epic formula goes, Rush never had a better record.  Moving Pictures was just as good as this one but by then, they had converted to more conventional song structures.  Everybody knows about the notorious 20 minute long progressive rock epics of the 70s and some of them can be quite overblown.  2112, however is among the best and most direct of these epics.   For me, this is the closest you can get to a sci-fi epic in the form of a rock record.

B000002UB6|4.0|This is The Beatles last album.  Not the last to be recorded but the last to be released.  This is the point where the tensions within the group were really beginning to split it apart.  It is incredible that they managed to record one more album after this one with Abbey Road.  This is the rawest the group had been in a long time and even though Phil Specter is producing it, his normal spit and shine polish is completely absent here even on the heavenly orchestrated songs, \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", and the title track.      Everything here sounds under-produced. Two of the tracks are just flat out segments and there is a great deal of studio chatter in between songs.  The best songs here, however, are among the most gut-wretching confessional songs the group ever wrote.  \\"Across The Universe\\" is a beautiful folk song where John Lennon dreams of the heavens the beauty of the natural world.  Paul McCartney's \\"Long And Winding Road\\" accuratly describes the group's career and all the turmoil they'd faced.  No fancy studio techinques or elaborate production here.  Just some of the best songwriting imaginable.      The group had a bad experience recording this album as well as with filming the movie of the same name.  I think that the ability to turn out quality material even if you're not on good terms with the rest of your band makes you an exceptional musician.  The Beatles managed to record this album and even another one after it.  Stuff like that makes the Beatles truly one of the greatest teams ever.
0739357263|3.0|The main characters were facinating. Too many to keep straight and connected through the story.

I bought it to follow the Jack Reacher character but he was a totally different person.
B0000009RX|5.0|Frank Zappa was the first recording artist to completely say no to pop music. He did so with a passion and it is most relevant on this recording.  Often praised as his best work, Zappa and The Mothers Of Invention attempt to create a commentary on the hippie movement and the flower generation.  Or, more specificly, a commentary on how fake and corrupt they were.  The album is titled, We're Only In It For The Money.  A completely sarcastic statement that is complemented by a mock Sgt Pepper cover complete with nipple badges.  The title and cover are reflections of the music itself which is the ultimate 60's anti-pop gem.    Nothing on the album is taken entirely serious.  You never hear actual full songs and some of the avant-garde stuff is purposely close to unlistenable.  This is all for the purpose of saying \\"screw you!\\" to conventional pop formulas.  Although many people say so, I don't see this album as being a parody.  Zappa's first album \\"Freak Out!\\" was more of a parody.  It consisted of pop songs that were twisted and \\"freaked out\\" in order to poke fun at pop.  We're Only In It For The Money, however, sounds nothing like anything before it or since it.  It doesn't mock the 60's, it simply says no to them.    Everything here derails some aspect of 60's life.  Lyical songs like \\"Who Needs The Peace Corps?\\" reveal the phonieness of the \\"LSD\\" generation.  Others like, \\"What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body\\" actually have very insightful messages underneath the comical atmosphere.  Then there are others like the \\"Chrome Plated Megaphone of destiny\\" that exists for the sole purpose to slap pop music in the face.  The whole album seems humorist but is really a very serious take on the world during the 60's.    Albums like this paved the way both for Progressive Rock and Alternative Rock.  It was art rock in the way it inverted conventional rock structures and was alternative in the way it created a backroad for getting away from the mainstream.  No way did the groupdo this only for the money.  They wanted to be different and they did so in the best possible way.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|Terrific animation, very beautifully done. The production values are outstanding, as this is from the Classic Disney period. Thus the 4 star rating. However, the movie consists of several episodes which don't blend together very smoothly. And the characters Alice meets are nearly all really weird or nasty, which is not very appealing to a young child. (I don't see how a walrus tricking baby clams to leave their mother, only to be eaten, is good child entertainment). We have bought several other Disney classics which our daughter enjoys more. But she did like this one to a certain extent, as she sympathized with Alice.     The songs in this movie were not as catchy as those in other Disney productions, such as Peter Pan and Cinderella.     There is a strong irony to this movie, as Disney was all about creating magical fantasy worlds, and Alice in Wonderland is about how a fantasy world can be bizarre, sad, and ultimately dangerous. Wonderland is not wonderful at all.
B000000XB9|5.0|I'd forgotten just how good Creedence was. The only song missing from this compilation, as far as I'm concerned, is Born on the Bayou. It's funny, back in the day, Creedence Clearwater Revival was not really on my radar--I liked their stuff when it came on the radio, but not enough to buy the albums. There was so much really great music coming out when I was in high school (70-74) that I liked more. I took for granted the musical riches available. Voicing the opinion that \\"music today isn't nearly as good as back in MY day\\" would make me an old fogey. So I won't.  But I'll tell you what--my young adult daughter came over while I was playing this CD. As she came through the door, she hollered, \\"Whooooo! CCR!\\"

0375842381|3.0|After finishing all of the His Dark Materials trilogy, I have to say that I was not impressed with Pullman's writing style.  As an Adult reader, I felt that there was quite a bit lacking in terms of scenery and in terms of characterization, and there were so many parts that droned on and on.  And yet, at the end of all three books, there was a sense of a hurriedness that made the books feel really incomplete, especially in the first book (which was the best out of all of them).  While the book was not bad enough for me to give up reading on it, I really abhorred the non-climactic ending of the trilogy.  I am too spoiled by Tolkien's Hobbit and C.S. Lewis Narnia.      As for children though, I would say they will probably eat it up and it's a good book for them to read if you don't mind the Anti-Church themes that begin to permeate around the middle of the first book.  This hate for the dogmatism of religion culminates in the end of the third book as \\"'Christianity is a powerful and convincing mistake...'\\" which I am quoting directly from the Amber Spyglass.  So parents beware if words like these frighten you.  I am Christian myself, and was not offended because I see what Pullman is REALLY attacking, and it is religious zealots, but children may not be wise enough to understand.     I will not be picking up anything by Pullman again because he simply bores me after a while.
079284131X|3.0|I thought this movie was pretty good, and the effects for the time were ok, but I thought this movie was more funny than scary, and apparently the producers must have saw something funny too, cause they made all the other sequel funny on purpose.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I was eagerly awaiting this film, especially given the secrecy surrounding its main themes prior to its theatrical release: was it another 'aliens invade the U.S.' flick or what? We now have *some* of the answers!     First things first: if you suffer from motion sickness, you may want to give this film a pass. Adventurous director-and-producer team Matt Reeves and J.J. Abrams make use of the camcorder-POV and give Blair Witch Project a real run for its money. They add realism to this POV by showing us snippets of a video two of the main characters Rob Hawkins and Beth MacIntyre (Michael Stahl-David, Odette Yustman) shot about a month before being recorded over by accident. I started to call this review *BWP Meets Godzilla*, but that seemed like a cheap shot that doesn't do justice to an interesting, creative, and disconcerting flick that has gained a substantial cult following.     For the first 18 minutes, little of interest happens unless you're into lower Manhattan upscale yuppie drama: Rob's going away party takes a downturn when Beth (from the earlier video) shows up with another guy. Suddenly, everything begins shaking and the lights flicker. Hud (T.J. Miller) - the guy with the camcorder - focuses our attention shakily on a news broadcast reporting that a tanker has capsized near the Statue of Liberty. The group goes to the roof to see if they can see anything. An explosion south of them sends flaming debris raining across the sky driving them back indoors and down to street level.     Moments later is one of this film's best special effects, as the badly damaged head of the Statue of Liberty careens down into the street in front of them. In the distance, the Woolworth Building collapses. The group is driven back indoors again by the wall of dust and debris. Hud's camcorder caught something nasty moving into the city, prompting an \\"It's alive!\\" What is it?     As the plot unfolds, we learn: a creature the size of a skyscraper has attacked the city. From thecharacter Marlena (Lizzy Caplan): \\"It's eating people!\\" The group makes a sensible decision to get out, crossing the Brooklyn Bridge with a crowd of evacuees. Rob is trying to contact Beth on his cell. He learns that she is trapped in her apartment, injured and unable to move. Then a more immediate tragedy strikes: the creature attacks and knocks out a portion of the bridge's support structure, sending a large portion of the Brooklyn Bridge down into the river. Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) is killed.     Rob again reaches Beth. He wants to rescue her. An argument ensues over the wisdom of this, but Rob - feeling guilty about how he'd treated her earlier - convinces the group to attempt a rescue. Their odyssey takes them through a subway station and into a tunnel where they must fight off nasty-looking parasites that \\"fell\\" from the larger creature. Marlena is bitten. At the other end they encounter a military unit that is evacuating the city. While in their makeshift facility, Marlena comes to a bloody end. Rob wants to leave for Beth's place. Those in charge of the facility won't stop him, but everyone leaves at 0600 the following morning. Be back or be trapped in the ruined city.     To shorten this account, the group reaches Beth - in her badly damaged apartment building they must access through the roof from a neighboring tower. She has been impaled through her shoulder on a piece of rebar. They rescue her, then make their way back to the street and to where the helicopters are leaving.     Do Rob and Beth make it out of the city? Watch the film! But bewarned: the helicopter scene is particularly dizzying, and then something happens that will make you jump ten feet. Yes, we get a close-up of the monster before it chows down on our hapless camcorder operator. The camcorder-POV has enabled Matt Reeves to direct this film in a stream-of-immediacy mode, freeing him of the need to explain what the creature is or where it came from. (The Wikipedia entry for this movie tells us that during the final clip of the earlier, recorded-over video, an object can be seen falling from the sky. I watched that scene over and over, but couldn't see anything.)     I have a few problems with the film, which explains the lack of five stars. (1) Rob has just lost his brother. Would he even be thinking about rescuing a girl he spent one night and one day with? (2) The other characters seem oddly nonchalant about Marlena's bite, as nasty-appearing as the parasites themselves. (3) Beth had been impaled on a piece of rebar in her apartment. I can't see three people simply lifting her off of it, followed by her getting up and joining them in getting out of the building and to a waiting helicopter. It is much more likely she would be in too much pain for that, and would lie there until she bled to death. (4) My biggest complaint: I have trouble visualizing a guy running through the streets, fending off attacking parasites, leaping across a debris-encumbered roof, etc., while filming everything on a camcorder.     None of these complaints need prevent your enjoyment of a nice combination of elements with more than a few genuine scares! I'm already hearing rumors about a Cloverfield 2 going into production.

B00005MP58|5.0|If you like eiter the book or the other film starring Kiera Knightly you'll love this movie.  The only downside to the movie is that it is so long that it is definately a two-night deal.  Overall I prefer the casting in the newer version of Pride and Prejudice, but nobody can beat the haughtiness of Colin Firth.  Jennifer Ehle is wonderful, but in my opinion she is much prettier than the character Jane who is supposed to be the great beauty.  (Obviously it's not a drawback to the film, just an observation).  This is by far the best version of Pride and Prejudice.  I only wish that Judy Dench had played Lady Catherine De Bourg in this version as well.

B000002UD7|4.0|Leaving their early critics in the dust, Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant made on of the 80's consummate synthpop albums with their sophomore \\"Actually.\\" From the detached yawning duo on the cover to the dry wit of such classic singles as \\"Rent\\" or \\"Shopping,\\" this is a slice of the late 80's. But it also marked a maturity in the music that listeners of [[ASIN:B000002U9K Please]] probably would not have expected. \\"It Couldn't Happen Here\\" was one of the first pop songs to directly confront AIDS (in 1987) and \\"Kings Cross\\" took a withering look at what Britain had become under Thatcher.<br /><br />In the 2001 reissue of \\"Actually,\\" Tennant comments that he doesn't feel this holds up as a full album. Ah, but so goes the thoughts of distance from your work; IMHO, the only PSB album that holds together better is their masterpiece from 1993, [[ASIN:B000024QML Very]]. Perhaps it is the singles that make him think maybe the album is fragmented, but who could argue with the two brilliant hits here? The dance smash \\"It's a Sin\\" opens with sacred sounding chords before plunging headlong into guilty pleasure danceland. It's one of the duo's best, yet when they wanted to top themselves, they added a third. \\"What Have I Done To Deserve This\\" is - simply - one of the decade's most sublime singles. Luring the late Dusty Springfield out of retirement to play the jilted lover to Neil's miserable ex-boyfriend. It's nothing short of brilliant and it became PSB's US high-water mark.<br /><br />For the hits alone, \\"Actually\\" is worth it. Add the solid songs throughout, and it's as good an album from the Pet Shop Boys as you could ask for.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|Many years ago, Richard Donner was working on filming back to back Superman adventures, and filing was put on hold for the sequel in order to finish 'Superman the Movie'.  When this was a huge hit, the Salkinds, who produced the film, decided to fire Donner in favor of a director they felt would be more cooperative . . . or at least that's one version of the story.  Lester used a great deal of the original footage Donner shot, but added some new scenes and adapted the sequel to mesh with the new ending of the first movie (originally, Superman would not go back and change time until the end of Superman 2).  But Donner always wished he could have made the sequel his way, and while that can never really happen, this is as close as we're ever going to get.  Utilizing footage and effects long considered lost, this labor of love presents a Superman sequel more in line with the original script.  While retaining some Lester footage, and despite the use of some mismatched screen test footage in one scene which was never filmed any other way, this movie stands as the true sequel to Donner's groundbreaking film, and is a wonderful treat for fans of the series.  So if you ever wondered what if, then check out this disc. Plus: Marlon Brando is BACK!
B00062IVKS|5.0|Considered by many to be the greatest film of the 80's, and ranking number four on AFI's top 100 greatest American films, `Raging Bull' has become a landmark in American cinema.  Martin Scorsese will always be remembered for this film, and rightfully so, for `Raging Bull' is not merely a sports film or merely just a drama but `Raging Bull' captures something rare, something monumental.  `Raging Bull' captures the essence of a man and the time in which he lived with such precise perfection that the audience is transported into this mans life, walking in his shoes and fighting his personal (as well as professional) battles.<br /><br />There are many facets to this movie that help elevate it to `masterpiece' levels of brilliance.  First you have the flawless direction by Martin Scorsese.  In my humble opinion this is probably his finest moment behind the lens.  Scorsese is often praised for his `gangster' films, most notably `Good Fellas', but in my eyes it will always be his weightier work that shines the brightest.  Films like `Taxi Driver' and `Raging Bull' are truly Scorsese's crowning achievements.  His decision to shoot the film in classic black and white film is another bonus to an already fantastic film.  It adds layers of honesty and humanity that are at times lost in the glitzy colors flooding the screen.  Stripping it down in this way allows the rawness and realness of these people to shine through ten fold.  Scorsese is also responsible for capturing some of the greatest scenes of violence ever recorded on film.  Of course this is violence within the ring, calculated and controlled violence, but Scorsese displays it in such a sporadic and brutal way that the audience is in a way pummeled mercilessly by the images attacking the screen.  The only other director I've seen able to capture this same intensity was Ron Howard in `Cinderella Man'.  Others have tried, and they have done so admirably, but truly none have reached this level of perfection.  Scorsese was also able to capture the feel and mood of the era in which `Raging Bull' takes place.  The way individuals interact with one another, the dialog and the emotional construction is a marvelous representation of the time period as well as the subject.  Scorsese had a real grasp of what he was attempting to deliver, and the end result is nothing short of perfection.  Couple this with Michael Chapman's glorious cinematography, rich and vibrant despite it's grit and lack of color, and you have a film that looks as brilliant as it plays out.<br /><br />Honestly though, no matter how brilliant Scorsese was, `Raging Bull' would be nothing without Robert De Niro.  As the tortured and violent boxer Jake La Motta, De Niro ignites the screen with fiery determination and complete control and understanding of his character.  This is one of those moments where the actor is so lost within his character that you forget you are watching a motion picture.  These are the moments that cement De Niro as one of the greatest actors to ever grace the big screen.  Sure, his recent film choices have been less than desirable, but there is no denying that in his prime he was better than anyone has ever been.<br /><br />De Niro has help in the form of Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci.  Pesci is flawless as Jake's devoted brother Joey.  From his very first scene onward you are drawn into his character and become invested in him.  Pesci is always on top of his game when playing the scheming and loud mouthed gangster (i.e. `Casino' and his Oscar winning performance in `Good Fellas') but here he is more subdued and subtle and I think this adds a layer of realism to his performance.  In my opinion, this may be his finest performance to date.  Cathy Moriarty is also stunning as Vickie, La Motta's second wife.  The blonde bombshell gives De Niro a run for his money and proves she is more than just a pretty face.  Her attachment to her character is obvious and certainly pays off in the end.<br /><br />`Raging Bull' masterfully interweaves La Motta's violent profession with his violent persona, giving us a glimpse into a man who took his work home with him in the most literal of senses.  There is no flaw to be found here, for Scorsese crafts a marvelous portrait of a man destroyed by his own carnal weaknesses.  Looking back, I don't think it can be stressed enough how marvelous the year of 1980 really was.  All five Best Picture nominees were deserving of their nominations, and while `Raging Bull' is not my favorite of the five (in my humblest of opinions `The Elephant Man' was the Best Picture of 1980) there is no doubt in my mind that Martin Scorsese deserved that directing Oscar one-thousand times over.  Regardless, there is no denying the fact that `Raging Bull' is a flawless film, a marvel, a spectacle and most definitely one of the greatest films ever made.s La Motta's violent profession with his violent persona, giving us a glimpse into a man who took his work home with him in the most literal of senses.

B0017M413M|5.0|I love Stargate and really appreciated how this movie finale tied up all the loose ends.  You can tell they spent alot of money on the special effects.  I rented on my Tivo through Amazon unbox.  If you have a Tivo you have to try using that feature, it is awesome.
B00003CX9S|5.0|It's hard for me to formulate with mere words the impact this film has had on me.  `The Elephant Man' is so much more than a weepy drama about injustice, but in the end it becomes an overwhelming testament to the rarity of genuine kindness, and this is what serves as the catalyst for my falling tears.  David Lynch's masterpiece captures the audience, sinking every claw and tooth into the heartstrings of the viewer and relentlessly tearing it to shreds, but it does so with such graceful subtlety you barely realize you're being emotionally manipulated.  Some have balked at the idea that `The Elephant Man' does just that; manipulates the audience's emotions; but in my humble opinion I feel that that manipulation is necessary.  As a warm-blooded human being none of us want to accept the worst parts of us, and so it becomes vital for directors like Lynch to coax that realization out of us.<br /><br />What makes `The Elephant Man' and the more heartbreaking is the fact that it is based on actual events, and so the audience is forced to realize that this is no mere work of fiction but an accurate portrayal of what man is capable of.  Not even in your worst of nightmares could you make something like this up.<br /><br />The film tragically retells the story of John Merrick (whose actual name was Joseph Merrick), a man who, while possessing a beautiful soul, was cursed with a horrendous disfigurement that hindered him from ever being embraced by the `normal' people around him.  Paraded around as nothing more than a sideshow freak, an animal even, John's life has been reduced to slavery at the hands of Bytes, a ruthless and harsh sideshow entertainer.  Then his life is suddenly, and drastically, changed when he is discovered by Doctor Frederick Treves and ushered away from his cruel world and into the warm arms of the hospital.<br /><br />It's within those small moments of acceptance that the audience can find the most emotional connectivity to the film.  Sure, the scenes of unjust violence and mistreatment are bound to well up within us feelings of pain and sadness and overwhelming hopelessness, but it's the gestures of genuine kindness that carries the most weight.  I remember in particular a moment when Doctor Treves introduces John to his wife Anne.  The moment is so subtle, so tender and pure.  It touched me in the most passionate of ways because it confronted a basic need for acceptance, a need that most humans take for granted.<br /><br />`The Elephant Man' marvelously contradicts those moments of kindness with harsh depictions of hatred and ignorance as John is mistreated by those willing to use and abuse him for their own amusement.  David Lynch is able to capture the best and worst sides of human nature so vividly and fearlessly, never simplifying or downplaying anything but keeping true to an honest depiction of humanity.<br /><br />What helps elevate this film is the brilliant performances by the entire cast.  John Hurt is just incredibly moving as John Merrick, captivating the audience with just the glimmer of sincerity in his eyes.  While I can't deny that Robert De Niro's Oscar winning performance in `Raging Bull' was glorious and deserved of the Oscar I can't help but wish it would have been yet another Hepburn/Streisand moment and we could have seen both De Niro and Hurt walk away with a little golden man.  Anthony Hopkins also delivers an outstanding yet often overlooked performance as Frederick Treves.  Sadly his performance takes a backseat to Hurt's, but when one looks deep into the control and dedication in which Hopkins uses to deliver this performance once can't help but become outraged at his lack of awards attention.  He compliments Hurt beautifully and it is ultimately his act of kindness that stands as the pivotal message this entire film and its emotional connectivity hinges upon.  Anne Bancroft is also memorable as the famed theater actress Mrs. Kendall and Hannah Gordon's scene with John Hurt is so emotionally wrecking I have to single her out as extraordinary here.  Even Freddie Jones captivates, despite his unarguable despicability.<br /><br />Across the board `The Elephant Man' delivers effortlessly.  It is beautifully shot in rich black and white, adding layers to the rawness of the subject.  David Lynch, who is nothing short of a phenomenal and visionary director, manages to infuse so much honesty into this film I just can't help but become a part of it.  In all fairness, 1980 was a very strong year and it sports one of the greatest Best Picture lineups in the history of Oscar.  `Ordinary People' is a very well made film and is one that I enjoy immensely, but it did not deserve that Best Picture Oscar.  The film, since its win, has garnered a bad rap for `stealing' `Raging Bull's Oscar, but in my humble opinion that Best Picture Oscar rightfully belongs to `The Elephant Man', a superb masterpiece of cinema.<br /><br />This is the type of film that roots itself in the heart of the audience and resides forever within it.  It is a film that will force you to recognize the evil within ignorance but it will also force you to embrace and appreciate the rare moments of warmth and kindness.  The other day someone said to me that they only wished we could remember the good things people do.  I think that in the end that's what this film does for me.  It helps me to realize that there are good people trapped in this world of injustice and hatred.  Sadly that kindness is such a rarity, such a lost treasure that one is blessed if ever he were to find it.  Lynch beautifully makes that clear in what proves to be a film filled with conflicting emotions; feelings of sorrow, pain, misery and fear as well as hope, happiness, love and admiration.  No matter which way to look at it, `The Elephant Man' is an alarming story of humanity in its truest form.ally wrecking I have to single her out as extraordinary here.

B00005JPS7|5.0|If Superman has Lex Luthor and Spider-Man has Dr. Octopus and Batman has the Joker, who exactly is Iron Man's archenemy? He may engage in ferocious battle with an equally ironclad baddie near the end of the film, but I'm going to go in a much more existential direction and say that his greatest enemy is himself. In Jon Favreau's \\"Iron Man,\\" billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) eventually realizes that the ultra high tech weapons he designed have done much more harm than good, so in a way, the climactic fight scene at the end was his own doing. What a perfect display of irony, especially for a superhero trying to free himself of his infamous reputation as a war-mongering mass murderer. Where exactly is the line drawn? At what point can weapons of mass destruction ever be considered a path to peace?<br /><br />You don't normally associate moral dilemmas of this magnitude with a comic book adaptation. The thing is, the idea of a suited man fighting against an adversary plotting to take over the world is not lost in \\"Iron Man\\"--it just takes on a much different form. In this case the adversaries are war and injustice, both of which shake their threatening fists at the world every hour of every day. What is lost in \\"Iron Man\\" is the idea that a superhero has to be a perfect, emotionless drone that tirelessly fights for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Even with his money, his brilliance, and his specially designed suit, Stark is about as flawed as the average Joe walking down the street. He's stubborn, cocky, just a smidge arrogant, and after being held captive in Afghanistan for three months, he's far too willing place himself in scenarios he may not be ready for.<br /><br />Before being held captive, Stark was a smooth-talking businessman that designed the most advanced weapons the American military has ever seen. While in Afghanistan introducing a new missile-launcher called the Jericho, he's attacked and kidnapped by a militant group of Afghani extremists. They demand that he manufacture the Jericho for them, and since they somehow have gained access to many of his weapons, this shouldn't be too difficult. But even with a metal device implanted in his chest (supposedly to keep the shrapnel in his body from reaching his heart), he refuses to be under their control; with the help of an Afghani scientist (Shaun Toub), Stark secretly builds a prototype metal suit that can throw flames and shoot bullets and protect him from enemy fire. An elaborate escape scene leads to his rescue, which paves the way for a hilarious moment back in Los Angeles: as he sits in a limo refusing medical treatment, he demands that someone get him an American cheeseburger.<br /><br />Stark's experience triggers a newfound sense of responsibility, one that inspires him to shut down the weapons division of his company and focus on more humanitarian uses for technology. His colleague--Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges)--doesn't go along with this for reasons that are expected in comic book adaptations, such as being power-hungry. This doesn't stop Stark, who begins redesigning his metal suit in the comfort of his luxurious, technologically advanced Malibu estate. After installing a few upgrades, like rocket boosters and missile launchers, he tests his new red and gold suit by flying back to Afghanistan and attacking the same militant group that kidnapped him. How convenient that he happens to arrive just as they're raiding a village and taking civilians captive; superheroes save the day strictly because of convenient plot devices, and that's one of the reasons why we like these movies so much.<br /><br />With the help of his personal assistant, the anxious but highly capable Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his friend, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Stark spends the rest of the film trying to put an end to his past reputation, first by finding out how the Afghanis received crates of his weapons, second by battling against Stane, who haslet his position in the company get the better of him. Yes, it's all enhanced by a wealth of impressive special effects, but that's not the point: Stark is introduced as a man who has everything while at the same time having nothing, and most of this stems from his unwillingness to acknowledge his effect on the world--he essentially got rich making and selling weapons, devices that kill and maim. Now that he's seen the error of his ways, he wants to redeem himself by fighting against the monster of his own creation. He does this all while maintaining a smug yet charming attitude, which is good because a superhero should be allowed to have a little personality.<br /><br />Even better than that is not hiding that personality behind an alter ego, one that behaves as an obvious polar opposite to the hero. This story may be pure comic book fantasy, but Tony Stark brings a realism to it that's refreshing, more so than anything ever seen from Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne combined. It's essentially because of him that \\"Iron Man\\" transcends anything I've previously expected from a comic book adaptation. He says at a press conference that he's not the superhero type, and that's really funny because I thought the same thing about Robert Downey, Jr. when I saw the first ads for \\"Iron Man\\"; at the time, it seemed unlikely that he would be the type to fly alongside jetfighters or to shoot highly explosive missiles at tanks. But it's obvious now--he was exactly what was needed to realize the reworked idea of hero versus enemy. A lot of cool digital effects weren't a bad touch, either.get the better of him.

0441003257|5.0|Some of these reviewers didn't like this book, but they obviously missed the point and the jokes. I laughed a lot while reading this book and I never went into it assuming it would be some serious, deep, epic tale of fantasy fiction. I assumed it would make me laugh and I hoped it would be clever. My copy said something about Piers Anthony and I picked it up for the very reason that I wanted to read a book full of clever humour. It worked for that. It's a great book.

B001437DMA|4.0|for the first few listens of Satch's new album only 3 tracks stood out for me, the others were 'meh/ok and 1 in particular i didn't dig at all and that was 'Prof. Satchafunkilus'. but as usual with me it takes at least 7 or 8 listens for an album to grow on me and it was the same with 'PSATMOR'.    i made 2 mistakes before listening to Joe's new album 1, i expect another 'Crystal Planet' :P and 2, i take my Satch songs too seriously sometimes. what Joe has done with this record is not only put a few heartbreakers (Revelation, Out of the Sunrise) & two songs where he just lets rip (Asik Vaysel, Andalusia) on there but some fun tracks as well 'I Just Wanna Rock' 'PSATMOR' and 'Diddle-Y-A-Doo-Dat'.   the 3 \\"fun\\" tracks as i call them are very good and just take time to dig, at least that's how it was for me. and the solo on 'I Just Wanna Rock' is fantastic!     i enjoy this album alot more then 'Super Colossal' - it's a cross between 'Is There Love In Space?' and 'Flying In A Blue Dream' both great albums. it's no 'Crystal Planet' but Satch has done a great job with this album i just keep playing it! 4/5 my favs. 'Musterion' 'Revelation' & 'Out Of The Sunrise'    SATCH RULES! >=:o)
B00102F5WK|5.0|You're suddenly a terror suspect because of an errant cell phone call made to you? Sounds farfetched, yet that's the premise of this movie.  Anything can be used to tie someone to extremist.   What's next, spam? junk mail? facebook?  It almost wants to make you want to disconnect from everyone.      At one point in the movie, you think they got the right guy as Anwar \\"confesses\\" (after days of torture) to his connections with the extremist.  For a moment this scene, seems to justify the means of \\"gathering intelligence\\"; afterall, Anwar \\"confessed\\" to his connections....but the reality is, he doesn't have any connections with the extremist!    I can see how easy it is for my moral compass to be adjusted in only 1.5 hours because of his \\"confession\\". Can you imagine what would happen to us after days of psychological torture?  We'll all probably say and do whatever our tormentor wants us to....    Also enjoyed how the various sub-stories are intertwined, well crafted; so many characters trying to do the right thing, yet their actions push them far more into the world they all detest.    In my opinion, mind control is the ultimate objective of terrorist, afterall our minds and what we think about most, likely will dictate our course of action....

015626224X|5.0|Down and Out in Paris and London is yet another book by George Orwell I couldn't put down!  I am well into my adult life yet I had some how managed to not read any of his works until a friend convinced me I \\"Had\\" to read 1984.  I'd heard the term \\"Big Brother\\" like we all had but since I read that book, I have made it a mission in life to get my hands on everything he has ever written!  Without a doubt I would have to say he is certainly my favorite author!  Down and Out like all the works I've read by him thus far, grabbed me instantly.    The descriptions alone allows one the sense of being wherever it is he is describing and the characters he employs all smack of realism as does the subject matter and conversations themselves!  As in all the stories I've read by Orwell, he leaves no stone unturned!  Humor is addressed, reality is addressed, and one can't help but feel after reading this story that they have been given a birds eye view of living a life of poverty through the eyes one who has in fact endured it and can recant what was witnessed and observed with uncanny accuracy and in vivid detail!      Orwell will take you into the streets, into the pawn shops, into the squalor and one would think below human living conditions and the severe differences/truths about our society and the chasms that exist between those that have and those that have literally nothing.  Graphic, in depth in the varying beliefs and also sure to hit even the most emotionless person, in a place where they will no doubt feel sympathy for impoverished.    What Orwell has managed to do in all the stories I have read by him thus far, is take something like homelessness, poverty, refusing to bow to the \\"Money God\\" or politics or you name it and put a human face on it.    One that will remain with you long after you have completed the read.    Couldn't recommend this another \\"Extraordinary Literary Master Piece\\" with the rating system here so a five and hopefully the weight of what I have shared here will be enough to convince those that haven't read it, that they will be immensely thankful that they did.

0312427573|5.0|On the plus side, The Bonfire of the Vanities compares well with Balzac's stuff. I mean, the methods are similar. The story follows several very different characters living in New York, and each scene is detailed, particularized, analyzed, painted with a very fine brush. Many layers of New York's society are represented. There are no moral messages, no lessons to be learned, just life in New York in the late 'Eighties or early 'Nineties at its most intense, presented as \\"business as usual,\\" with corrupt politicians, lascivious prosecutors, moronic members of the jury, conceited stock market honchos, cynical lawyers, less-than-bright policemen, political opportunists, socialites, priests, opera singers, real estate agents with five thousand dollar manicures, rich faithful wives who deserve to be strangled, only it never occurs to anyone to strangle them, mistresses on the make, petty criminals, silly immigrants, bone-headed journalists, feminists of both genders, racial and ethnic tension - and on and on. The book is really a lot of fun.    On the other hand, the opus falls just short of making its author, well, \\"the Balzac of our time.\\" No scene is picturesque enough to be called cinematographic, and for a novel 800 pages long that's a bit, well, loquacious (on the author's part). The author tends to explain too much, and fits people and scenes together in such a way as to promote his own outlook, leaving the attentive reader no choice but to examine it. Upon closer examination, one realizes that Mr. Wolfe's main purpose is to show that people in general are vile, selfish, obtuse creatures (without exception); that life is a pretty ridiculous affair; and that any joy a person ever derives from living is brief, accidental, and usually comes at the expense of others. To put it plainly, THERE IS NO GOD in this novel. It was written by a fierce atheist. There is neither faith, hope, nor love in it. None. Life is algebraically plain and tedious.    (I realize I said earlier there were no moral messages in the book. There aren't any. The above is an OUTLOOK, not a message).    Literature thrives on extraordinary situations in which characters are inspired to perform extraordinary acts. The element of surprise in Wolfe's novel is purely circumstantial. Folks have no fre will in this story. (All atheists are determinists more or less by definition, I suppose).    In the past, I've had some interesting experiences related to the publication of this novel. Two years after it came out (in the early 'Nineties, I believe), the news finally reached the Philistines, and by Philistines I mean those representatives of the middle class (and, sometimes, the upper middle class; I have nothing to say about the actual upper class since no one, not even the representatives of the said class themselves, can figure out what the hell they're up to, what it is they do all day, and what their problem is) ... uh ... where was I? ... Philistines ... those representatives of the middle class that once in a while make a half-hearted effort to appear CULTURED, which, in their view, means catching a program on the History Channel once in a while and telling others that they're reading \\"this book, it's actually pretty good.\\" They never seem to finish this book. I mean, they sort of struggle through the first twenty pages, and then skim through the rest, and make plans to read it properly when they visit Aruba next year, or some such. They're always too busy, they never have any \\"free time.\\" One gets the impression that if they stopped being busy for a moment, civilization would just collapse and never recover. Anyway, this dude had a copy of \\"Bonfire\\" in his briefcase and was telling me (his colleague) how everybody had recommended this book to him. He was going to read it when he had some free time. He actually DID take it to Aruba (there was also a wife involved, I believe). He came back, I believe, without having finished it. A year later he died. He was a good guy, too. Reading just wasn't \\"his thing,\\" as Philistines like to say.    Anyway, when \\"Bonfire\\" came out, the hype was considerable, which for me is nearly always a turn-off. And then the movie came out (which, incidentally, was far more politically incorrect than the book, and the choice of actors and actresses was just UNBELIEVABLE; I loved it). So I put off reading \\"Bonfire\\" until, oh, I don't know, maybe after 9/11. By that time, home video games had become astonishingly popular, and crime rates started dropping everywhere across the nation, including New York (for which then-Mayor Giuliani took all the credit, of course). When I finally got to read it, the novel struck me as a bit dated. Not that any issues described in it with a flourish, social and otherwise, had become a thing of the past. The overall societal set of problems had shifted a little since the novel's publication, that's all.    The story is constantly balancing on the edge of political correctness, even though it never goes beyond the boundaries, not once. Even so, few other authors would dare show a book that probes so many \\"untouchable,\\" \\"sacred-cow\\" issues to an editor, and few editors would touch a book of this sort with a hundred-foot pole. The advantage of being Tom Wolfe, I suppose, is that during the decades he spent being a journalist and creating his own style (starting back in the '60's), the man gradually accustomed everyone to the fact that he says outrageous things and gets away with it. The degree of outrage has increased over the years, and today Mr. Wolfe can get away (I would imagine) with saying pretty much anything, because he knows that no one will take it (or him) seriously.    It is worth remembering, while reading this novel, that its author belongs to the glorious school of Southern authors with New York careers: the crux of American literature. God bless.
B000H2MTUA|5.0|Was a gift for my daughter who rarely reads and she loves it.  Read it through in a couple of days.
0345494997|4.0|I am enjoying this book but where are the photos? I had to google Mr. Wright and Mamah to find a photo and to find photos of his homes. How nice it would have been to have some photo inserts to show the man and    some of his work which was quite incredible for this time period.
0596009208|5.0|This book is for beginners but it assumes that you know the basics about computer programming, I mean, it won't teach you what is a program, what is code or those very basics things. If you have programmed in C, C++ or C# then this books could be slow for you but still useful but if you don't know about those languages or Object Oriented Programming then this book is great to learn OOP and JAVA, really good.
B000FZETKC|5.0|This wasn't my favorite 80s movie at first but after seeing it for the 50th time, it kind of grew on me.  You start to relate to Amanda Jones and feel sorry for her.  Gosh, all the popular girls in this movie remind me of chicks I went to school with.  Gag me with a spoon!
B000YMBBH0|4.0|These movies looks excellent on hi-def. Pictures great, sounds great but I would like these movies to come in one especial box with some nice design and other stuff for collection porpouses
B000M341QE|4.0|this is a good movie for adults,  liked the all star cast.  some were acually from the boston area, so the accents were authentic in many cases. lots of twists and turns.
B00007GZQI|3.0|Normally, this type of comedy is not my thing, but I saw the clip online of Yul Brynner in \\"The Magic Christian\\" and feel that this vignette alone would be worth ANY price!  (Can't imagine the masculine Yul as a woman? HAH He is excellent!!!)
B00006HAZG|3.0|I enjoyed part one of this production. Daniel Ratcliffe is charming as the young David. It was interesting to see the inate talent of the actor who grows up to assume the character of Harry Potter. Bob Hoskins and Maggie Smith are perfectly cast in their roles. Although the supporting players in part two are excellent, the actor who plays the older David lacks the charisma and acting ability of Ratcliffe.Perhaps the second part of the book is not as interesting either which may account for the let down of part two. Still very worthy of viewing
0756404746|5.0|What I am trying to say is that this is an 'intellectual' fantasy.  It's more than just magic and swordplay, but is grounded in a very plausible world.  This sits on a level with Modesitt, Niven, Farmer and all the other great series.      The only thing you need to know at this point is that there will be three books in the first series (more to come I hope).  The Books are called Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3, because the main protaganist (Kvothe) is telling his life story to 'The Chronicler' over a three day period.  So by the end of Book 3 we should know his life story up to the current time.      Rothfuss has left himself all kinds of leeway in the future to fill in stories that have been partially told, or to give us more about the world he has created.  Already after Book 1, you can feel yourself hoping for ancillary stories that will fill in the blanks of the 'world' and times that Kvothe lives in.  One of the most palatable parts of this story is that the main characters (and therefore the author) never take themselves overly serious (like in the 'Lord of the Rings').    My biggest hope is that he doesn't do a 'Farmer' and take years to bring out the last book, or a 'Martin' where each book seems to take forever or worst of all a 'Jordan' and never decide on an end (which of course the Lord High and Mighty decided to end for him).  The best would be for a distinctive sequel series (a la Eddings) or multiples.  Having taken ten years to write this series, let hope there's more to come and he doesn't get impressed by his own celebrity.
1577314808|5.0|I bought The Power of Now after reading A New Earth. I found that it reinforces all the   Concepts I learned in A New Earth. Together, these books have had a profound impact on my own personal spiritual journey. Each day, I wake up ready to become more conscious of the present moment. The past cannot be changed and the future is in the present moment. How liberating it is to experience each moment to the fullest without regrets over the past or fear of the future. I recommend any books by Eckhart Tolle.
0810994739|5.0|These books are light and fun to read.  A nice break for my 10 year old son who reads a lot of WWII Books.  Though it is below his level.  He also has the first book and has read it several times.  Both books have been passed along to my 9 year old daughter who also loves them.  Particularly good if you have a reader that is intimidated by books with less pictures.

0790731509|5.0|Paul Newman stars as Luke along with a marvellous cast in a prison gang film set in the deep south. Luke is a former war hero who when very drunk one night starts damaging parking meters (the very beginning of the film) and ends up serving time. Although apparently a very laid back character, the death of his mother changes Luke's attitude and the film hinges on this critical moment.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed the film in the past on TV, but was too young to have seen it at the cinema first time round. So to see it now on DVD, in widescreen, on a large TV only emphasised just how good it really is. There are many classic scenes, the most famous of which is the car wash (for the men anyway), and the attempt to eat 50 boiled eggs. Quite a few others will leave an impression on you as well.<br /><br />Its Newmans film all the way but George Kennedy (also still alive at the time of writing) pushes him close as 'dragline' in the acting honours. Also listen out for Lalo Schifrin's (Jazz Pianist and Film/TV Score writer - most famously Mission Impossible) superbly atmospheric music as well.<br /><br />The film is currently rank 118 in the IMDB list of the top 250 films of all time. Its well worth buying at any sensible price and can be picked up cheap if you look around.
0307237702|4.0|First, I must mention that I am not really in non-fiction kind of guy.  Despite my reading habits I have always been fascinated by this \\"rock-star\\" politician who began shaking everything up year or two ago.  I figured if I was going to read a politically-based book, this one would be the place to start.  Regardless of my party affiliation I truly believe that Mr. Obama is a good man with a simple message - even with all of this Jeremiah Wright brew-ha-ha going on.  His book: Audacity of Hope provides us a glimpse of what direction Barack would like to see the country move in.  He gets high praise from me (and obviously many others) for his vision of the future.  He intertwines stories from his personal life that makes us believe that he is a very humble man who has worked hard for what he has, is thankful for all he has achieved and does not take his family or success for granted.  However, just like his speeches he writes in generalities.  His writing provides historical fact, analysis and general ideas about the shape our government should take.  What's missing all-around is how he plans on getting there.  Maybe a book isn't the place to do that since the sociological environment and political landscape changes on a daily basis?  Writing a book in which the plans are too specific would not stand the test of time?  We'll see.  What I probably enjoyed most of all is learning about Barack, the man -- the son, grandson, husband, and father.  I think that regardless of what happens in Election '08 we'll be hearing much more from Sen. Obama and seeing more in print in the future.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I have been pretty much listening to it non-stop since I received it and put it on my iPod.  I loved Confessions, but I find this one was quicker for me to catch on to.  Hard to say which are my favorites, as it seems like all of them are.  I can't think of any throwaways on this album like I experience with so many other albums.  Madonna delivers as far as value goes.  I can't wait to see what she does in concert for a couple of these songs - I suspect it will be hilariously naughty.      It seems to be a blend of 80s new wave/pop and hip hop (which I am not too entirely sure, but I am going by the other descriptions).  I haven't listed to the 30 second clips, so I have no idea if they accurately reflect the moods of the songs, especially with the interesting breaks/bridges the songs take.    I think if you're a Madonna fan you will be happy with this.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|I loved the first three albums of Portishead (including the live one), and believe that they hold up remarkably well. As many fans, I bought the album as soon as it was announced. And it was the biggest musical disappointment in recent memory. Have you ever listened to Morricone's \\"serious\\" (and serial) music? Or Gershwin's attempts at serious (Ravel-influenced) experiments? Or Zappa's fixation with Edgar Varese? These are all examples of gifted popular musicians with a knack for melody and harmony, who give in to an inferiority complex and give a shot at respectability. In the case of \\"Third\\", the album is significantly more angular, harder to listen, and ultimately a failure. There is not an interesting melodic line, and the arrangements and moods have lost all their originality. Beth Gibbons has turned into a parody of herself. It's depressing and saddening. I could barely bear the musical death of Massive Attack. But Portishead? Is Bristol turning into the city of the undead???
B001794FOK|5.0|the beginning of the film was slow but very interesting at instant when the boy teleported into the library. as the story progresses, he learns more about his usual powers - becomes very humiliating to another character with Samuel L. Jackson, who tries to hunt down these people to extinct them!! His friend who he found at an old collosseum in Italy was very coool!! \\"Exciting and eye-popping!\\"
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Great set of movies! They are a family favorite for us.  I was very happy with how fast they were delivered.  You'll enjoy all the special features that come with this box set.  You have the option of watching the movies how they were intended to bee viewed by the director.  Always super fast shipping and prices I can afford when I order through Amazon.  Enjoy!!
0756404746|5.0|I could not put this book down when I started reading it. When I got to the end of the book, I turned it right back over and started reading it again.    Rothfuss has taken a lot of time to polish his art of storytelling. While there are obvious influences from some of the great sci-fi/fantasy writers (most notably to me being Orson Scott Card), he has created a world entirely his own. This is not a cookie-cutter fantasy novel. The characters are unique to the point that even at the end of the book, you might not know who (or in some cases WHAT) they are.     There is no overbearing moral line, though there is one rather obvious (and somewhat of a throwaway) Christ story chapter. There is no attempt to push a feel-good scenario onto the reader.     This is the story of one extraordinary man that gets put into extraordinary situations. Some good. Some bad. Do not expect triumph. Only expect to hear a good story told by a great storyteller.

B00000HZFH|5.0|at some point you will need this album.  (and for those who care-- this album is an incredibly well recorded, mixed, and mastered rock album, which in this case adds an enormous amount to an already unique sound).
B0002F6AH0|3.0|Most of the other reviewers have covered the high points and All together the series does a decent job of covering many of the highlights of the second world war. However, the incredibly oppressive use of dubbing to add explosions along with other repetitive, unnecessary and imminently distracting and mind numbingly false sound effects proves to be extremely detrimental to the experience of watching this series. Dubbing is often done on old reel footage from Big Two, however in this case the experience is so overwhelmingly oppressive and poorly executed that it strays to the obscene. For example in one scene there is a dog attempting to jump into the interior of a bomber and the dubbing \\"experts\\" saw fit to add a loud whining sound on loop over the video.<br /><br />As others have said, the history is good, the narration is illuminating but the sound is so bad that it detracts from the whole experience to teeth grating and ultimately the diminishing of the message with a overriding sense of falseness that this addition of sounds that are not only unnatural but dishonest to the material. Adding to the shoddy sound is the Journalistic nature of the discourse. This is to say that they are only talking about certain portions of the war that are of \\"interest\\" to them and many of the things they cover (or more often don't cover at all) leave a somewhat inaccurate impression of the actual war. I'd recommend the BBC history of world war II or simply \\"The War\\" much more over this collection.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|This album is a great collection of Van Morrison's classics. Van Morrison is one of the truly great artists.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|I have always admired Portishead for their ability to take seemingly discordant sounds and turn it into something beautiful.  I initially thought that perhaps it was not an easy listen but ten plays later, I've determined that it's just not a good album.  It's overall very sloppy and dispassionate.  I'm actually pretty confused over the high praise it has received.  Eleven years later, they certainly have not evolved into something better.

B0010V4TZU|4.0|Indie has recently become huge, and there are many new indie bands who either make a bang, or just failed to start with. And many big bands are indie-for-the-sake-of-being-indie bands. It's weird music, and nothing more. Vampire Weekend made me blink a few times before I could actually appreciate them. They did something different, but didn't make you turn grey. It's intelligent indie-pop, that's suitably for a Sunday afternoon, Friday Night party, or anything. It can fit in every aspect of your life, and that's a good thing.     Some tracks have violin sections reminiscent of Arcade Fire, and some drumming might take you back to Paul Simon's \\"Graceland\\". Other than that, nothing else is relatable. They truly have an original sound. A few of my favorites were Oxford Comma, Cape Cod Kwassa, Walcott, and Campus.    I think that everyone should try out Vampire Weekend, because I believe that it has something for everyone, except maybe metalheads... I'm truly looking forward for their next album. Keep it up mates!
B0011FXLCC|2.0|Frankly, it's a disappointing follow up to their last album.  Where's the \\"beat\\"? Thank GOD I didn't go see them last Saturday as I probably would have been bored stiff as they wallow through some pretty lifeless music from this album.  It feels like Goldfrapp was listening to a lot of Kate Bush to me.  I love Kate Bush but this is not what I expected from Goldfrapp and Kate does \\"it\\" so much better.  I dug Goldfrapp's last album.  Maybe this will grow on me the more I listen to it but I'm afraid it will end up in the stack of less played cd's.  A highlight on the record is the 60's inspired, Roberta Flack like song titled \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\".  There is nothing on this album that is as good as their song, \\"Number 1\\" for example.  If you want some real mellow music, stuff that floats by and you like Goldfrapp's vocals then you might enjoy this record.  However, if you liked their synthesizer POP influenced sound with BEATS then you should pass on buying this record.

0307265730|4.0|I finished reading \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" by Jhumpa Lahiri in about four days. To me, that's the first hallmark of a good book--that you want to keep on reading it.<br /><br />One reason I was so motivated to keep on reading was that Lahiri writes such accessible characters. They grapple with issues we all do (parents not understanding you when you're young, the death of a parent, etc.). Lahiri's characters in this book are as human and flawed as the rest of us, in spite of (or maybe because of) the pressure put on them to be so successful.<br /><br />Lahiri gives many of us a window into what it's like to grow up Indian in America. I like the way that she adds details about Indian culture, foods, etc., but not to the extent that it alienates or makes the story inaccessible to someone of non-Indian background like myself.<br /><br />Her writing style, at least to me, seems basic in that it's not cluttered with a lot of florid adjectives and description. Yet the characters' stories still come across as real. She gets to the essence of these characters and leaves out what is unnecessary.<br /><br />In reading some of the previous reviews, I do agree that Lahiri should try extending her range by writing about Indian or Indian-American characters outside of the highly educated class that seems to be a hallmark of her stories so far. While her stories do show a certain degree of variety and uniqueness, there is always the danger of producing stories of a uniform sameness if she's not careful.<br /><br />Overall though, I definitely recommend this book, as well as her earlier \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" collection.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|If you are interested in what music should sound like, this is the album for you.  A lot of hype surrounds the way the album was released, however the product itself is what the hype should surround.  This ablum is the type of cd that you can actually hit the random button on your cd player and enjoy it.  I hope that more bands learn from Radiohead and decide to make a great album and not worry about that one single for the radio.
B0002K6Z16|5.0|In my mind this album will always be associated with a chilling 1970s movie called [[ASIN:0790739240 Badlands]]. The opening track Nebraska reflects the plot of the film and refers to the \\"Badlands of Wyoming.\\" This gloomy album must the blueprint of what later became known as \\"Americana\\" and even Alt Folk. Just a cursory glance at the lyrics reveals the following place names: Lincoln, Philly, Atlantic City, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, Johnstown, Perrinneville, Mahwah, Wyoming and Linden Town, enough to make [[ASIN:B0009J8FG8 Sufjan Stevens]] envious.<br /><br />The melodious Atlantic City has a lilt to it whilst Nebraska and Mansion On The Hill are slow, stately and melancholy, but the tempo changes on the edgy Johnny 99 with its nervous guitar riffs, also present on State Trooper which connects thematically with Highway Patrolman, a moving tale of family troubles in slow tempo with a poignant chorus. An interesting observation on State Trooper is that it contains some of those yelps that [[ASIN:B0002MHBGM Alan Vega]] of the psychobilly band [[ASIN:B000040OBS Suicide]] made his trademark.<br /><br />The gentle Used Cars and the fast-paced Open All Night, the only real rock song, contain vivid car and road imagery. The line \\"radios jammed up with gospel stations, lost souls callin' lost distance salvation\\" reminded me of a tongue-in-cheek country song by the Stones called Far Away Eyes on the [[ASIN:B000007SL7 Some Girls]] album. The haunting masterpiece My Father's House with its oneiric imagery explores youthful memories, a lament for what is lost and a yearning for love and reconciliation.<br /><br />Reason To Believe concludes this bleak and grim exploration of the heartland on an optimistic, even spiritual note with the observation that ultimately people do find a reason to go on, echoing a similar sentiment on Atlantic City, that perhaps everything that dies someday comes back. This brooding album Nebraska is a gem created by an inspired blend of voice, guitars and harmonica. Plus the most gripping imagery and memorable poetic lyrics of course.e most gripping imagery and memorable poetic lyrics of course.
0446677450|3.0|I personally found the book repetitive in style. The key concepts were actually interesting and worded simply enough for me (a person who is not very knowledgeable about economics and financial matters) to grasp. Because the stories about the lessons were put very simply, the book was not a difficult read, but some of the underlying concepts, as in the ideas beneath the simple words, were a little harder for me to understand. Part of the reason that I find it hard to accept some of what Kiyosaki talks about is that I see people around me falling into the pattern of the rat-race but I can't really understand how wanting to play it \\"safe\\", in terms of avoiding sudden financial crashes, is necessarily a bad thing. I'm not sure if I like the idea of letting investments run their course in hopes that they bring in money because of the insecurity I attach to investing money in different businesses, stocks, etc.
B0016HNOXQ|1.0|Portishead, like Bjork, produce music that is more and more dissonant with each album.  I completely love their first album, I like about half of their second and I barely like 3 songs of this third album.  I can understand dissonance done to have a certain sound, but this is too much. A bad album. Bad, bad.
B000059QYB|4.0|Good songs like you remember them if you are an Idol fan. \\"Rebel Yell\\"  always a favorite! The only down side I've never been a favorite of live  recordings on CD's tapes etc. They always sound bad. I'm paying to hear  good quality music. The live recording is what you expect. Can't carry a  tune in a bucket haha other than that the rest of the songs are good. -1  for the live recording.

I usually jog in the park a few times a week but the weather is getting too warm so I thought I would give this a try.  My husband and I did it together and while it was challenging we got through it (only 20 mins, otherwise might have quit) and congratulated each other.  The next day we were so sore we could harldy sit down, let alone stand up.  We let a couple days pass and tried it again and that time it wasn't so bad.  Keep with it, its a great workout in a short amount of time and I think she is a great motivator.  I did even really bother with the \\"diet\\" part of the shred, it didn't seem very in depth and I have a diet plan of my own.

B00104QSOM|1.0|This was a movie that never seemed to end and never really seemed to go anywhere.  Daniel Day Lewis was, of course, fantastic in his role which I found similar to the one he played in Gangs of New York (basically, a truly and completely evil man).  However, TWBB lacked the supporting cast and the constantly moving plot of GoNY.  TWBB was a very slow movie that felt much longer that its 2 hr 40 min run time.  Unless you want to be bored into a hypnotic trance, I suggest you avoid this film.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Normally I'm not one for scarey shows or movies, but there's something about this series that makes me want to watch it.  Sure, Ackles & Padalecki make it fun to watch, but what keeps me watching is how they bring urban legends & sci-fi together.  I really enjoy watching this show at night, with the lights off, and no one else around.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My gf loves this cd! If you love Wicked you have to get this cd. Also, it's MUCH cheaper than buing it at the show! It's $30 at the show! Quite a deal! It's the EXACT same one!!    Enjoy!!
B00005JLWN|4.0|In this movie from 2002, starring Christian Bale, It had the most creative fighting scenes ever! I loved the fighting scene at the end, where Christian Bale took on like 80 guys at once by himself and seems unhurt at the end. In comparing this movie to George Orwell's 1984, I found notable comparisons, from Christian BaLE'S CHILDREN, TO The Parson children in the novel. Both had children whom by apperances seemed loyal to the party, and willing to turn in thier parents. Likewise, the book and movie, have monitored coversations, i.e., through tvs. In both, the main character is drawn away from the desired living, and rebells. I like how Chrisitan Bale's character turns, when he accidently destroys a dosage of medicine he has to take. His orginal partner is like Syme or Julia, because they were also drawn to rebelion against the goverment.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Great movie. Possibly one of the best of all time. TERRIBLE PACKAGING. The chintzy cardboard will nevr last. The green freaks have their way!!
0802130208|5.0|I started to read this book and then i got a little bored of it, then i picked it up and read it again and I loved the book. It's impossible not to laugh at Ignatius the main character. One of the funniest books I've ever read. A must read, Too bad the author killed himself he would of been huge.
0142501123|5.0|My son loves this book so much, we wore out the first copy to the point that it was beyond me being able to tape the binding back together anymore.  We bought him a second copy that has been \\"loved\\"  as much as the first, and so we had to buy a third copy for my toddler so she had her own book that didn't have pages falling out while we were reading it.  At one point, I had all the words in the book memorized, which came in handy while we awaited the arrival of our replacement book.  At first glance, it may seem that this is a Halloween book.  Let me assure you, you will enjoy reading this book all year long (I believe that my son asked to have this read to him every night for about 6 months) and the verse never gets tiresome.    The story teaches children about compassion and the need to help others, despite the fact that you may not really be in the best position to help at the time it is needed most.  Random acts of kindness by the witch thoughout the book are rewarded at the end of it when her friends save her from a fire-breathing dragon, and in return, she builds an even better broom to house her friends as a way of saying thank you.  It teaches kids how important it is to be nice to everybody, and to be ready to lend a helping hand, because you never know when you might need a little help yourself.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|I agree with one of the other reviews in that all the songs on this CD are good!! No fillers! Great rock band with a unique sound of their own. My best music buy this year so far.
1416563156|5.0|I gotta admit, despite being probably the world's most devoted Indy fan, when I first saw [[ASIN:1416563156 The Lost Journal of Indiana Jones]], I really didn't think too much of it.  With the impending release of [[ASIN:1593079524 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]], I fully expect to see a virtual tidal wave of movie tie-in merchandise leading up to the May 22nd Premiere.  Some of it cheesy (see my blog review of the Indiana Jones Adventure Spoon!) and some of it great.  This is definitely in the \\"great\\" category.<br /><br />But, as a devoted Indy fan, I bought it anyway (could I do anything else?) and it's really a clever idea.  It's not a book but a scrapbook.  The premise (such as there is) is that the KGB some how came into the possession of Dr. Jones Jr's diary in Peru, South America, in 1957.  It was later inherited by the mythical \\"Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation\\" and was consequently released to the public.  This is all established by a sort of page seal that fits over the front cover.  The back has a little more of the \\"back-story\\" on a label designed to be cleanly removed.  This is intentional as the book itself is made out of a  faux leather-type material and has an elastic band to keep the book closed.  It's obviously been designed to resemble Dr Jones, Sr's Grail Diary seen in [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)]].<br /><br />The inside of the book contains only a minimum of text, mostly being devoted to hand-drawn maps, taped in \\"letters,\\" pictures, and memorabilia of the kind that you'd expect from Jones' adventurous life.<br /><br />It's really a clever idea, pioneered by similar products like [[ASIN:076241572X Lucy & Desi: The Real Life Scrapbook of America's Favorite TV Couple]].<br /><br />This is definitely a must-have for any fans!  It'll take a place of honor  next to my Indiana Jones Khyber Bowie Knife!

B00005JPLW|1.0|This is a stark, powerful, and profoundly disturbing film. The action scenes are shot with great skill and the computer generation is up to date. The message is most important. You will learn that society should be based on fear of others, on glorification of violence, on hatred, rage, and on killing. You will learn that \\"freedom\\" means personal honor rather than responsibility toward others. You will learn that arrogance is maturity. You will learn that a great person is one who kills without warning or reason and a great nation is a nation that destroys and dominates other nations. You will learn that everything should be sacrificed to the military and to war; that war is the highest purpose of a nation and a people. You will see the total perversion of the ideals that motivated Jefferson, Washington, Adams, and the other founders, who most feared empire, and who tried hard to design a society that could not be corrupted by war as this one has. You will see propaganda worthy of Hitler and Mussolini, who also commissioned art like this. I can only hope that it is you who watch this movie, rather than your 14-18 year old children.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|And about frickin' time. After too many years away from the ramparts, after a string of records that sadly underwhelmed, R.E.M. is back in the mix with \\"Accelerate,\\" the band's 14th studio album and the one we've been waiting for: a musical document that fights the powers that be with raucous conviction, and a renewed confidence in the power of rafter-rattling rock as a musical and social force.    Talk about the passion? It's back, in what's already being called the album of the year.    \\"Accelerate is our turbocharged response to the times we live in,\\" Stipe told iLike. Longtime fans have wondered where that response has been for so long. There's some acclimation for the idea that the group lost focus and cohesion after the health-related departure of drummer Bill Berry in October 1997. The doubt and uncertainty that surely accompanied Berry's exit seeped into the records to follow. The three post-Berry studio releases -- \\"Up,\\" \\"Reveal\\" and \\"Around the Sun\\" -- had little of the spark of their predecessors.     \\"Up,\\" the first without Berry in tow, used either guest drummers or drum machines to replace him, but a lingering melancholy about his leaving coupled with a failure to jell creatively left many listeners uninspired. \\"Reveal,\\" while a beautiful, nakedly emotional record that explored rock's dream aspect and its poetic possibilities, still lacked much of the raw drive common to R.E.M.'s earlier, more memorable work. A listless exercise in navel-gazing, \\"Around the Sun\\" just lays there.     Sales for those three releases reflected a growing public indifference. The band's release of no fewer than six greatest-hits and retro compilations (not counting last year's live album), and its relative absence as a musical entity during the Bush years, validated for listeners what was once an unthinkable idea: R.E.M. didn't matter anymore.     That was then, now is better. With \\"Accelerate,\\" the pride of Athens, Ga., returns to its rightful place as a top-rank band.The band storms from the gate with \\"Living Well Is the Best Revenge,\\" an acid cri de coeur whose angry lyric explosiveness recalls \\"Ignoreland\\" on \\"Automatic for the People.\\" The fiery \\"Man-Sized Wreath\\" decries the \\"pageantry of empty gestures\\" of the present day. \\"Houston\\" takes dead aim at U.S. governmental inertia after Hurricane Katrina and the bureaucracy that forced residents of New Orleans to relocate to Texas.     Stipe turns the mirror on himself, his own inadequacies and insecurities. On the song \\"Hollow Man,\\" Stipe owns up to his own place in the pop-culture constellation, as candid and painfully confessional as anything from the band's past. And on the title track, he's grappling with that search common to all of us: looking for an avenue to personal change.     \\"Accelerate\\" had a public birthing; most of the songs were forged in the furnace of live performance, used as the set list for a series of test-drive concerts in 2007 at the Olympia Theater in Dublin -- attended, no doubt, by a tough crowd.  The evidence is in the tracks: R.E.M. has shaken off the doldrums with a return to the guitar-driven energy of its earliest and best incarnation (even while the band's acoustic, folky soul remains a constant) and an apparent willingness to go with the first or second draft, rather than fussing about trying to craft a masterpiece.    You can sprint through the album's 11 songs (not counting the two in the CD/DVD package) in about 37 minutes. Most of these tracks clock in in under four minutes, some a hair over three minutes long -- it's a return to a musical economy that characterized much of the band's \\"Document\\" and \\"Green\\"-era work.    \\"Accelerate\\" anticipates change -- from vast sweeping social change to the more incremental shifts in our own lives -- and embraces it, acknowledging the relentless pressures of mortality, even while confronting that mortality with an engaging, refreshing defiance.     To R.E.M., life's rich pageant is still a going concern.It's that force driving the flower through the green fuse again. The days are getting longer, the grass won't stop growing, the ice of too much winter is beginning to thaw, and redheads are walking with the promise of the season in their eyes ...     It's springtime, and R.E.M. is rockin' again. Give thanks.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a fast paced, high speed novel. The charactors are fresh and exciting. I have always said that people underestimate the power that kids have. Card took a group of kids and turned them into heros. I have always been one for the underdog, so the charactor of Ender was perfect. his struggles were real and his attitude riviting. My imaginantion ran wild and I suddenly found myself right there at Battle School in the midst if training! I would recomend this book to all ages, and don't wory if you don't think you are a Sci-Fi fan, from the first page you will be hooked. There are also 3 other books in the series, so make sure you check them out. Also don't forget the Ender's Shadow series (4 Books) that introduces the charactor of Bean. Both series are eaqually exciting and leaves you wanting more. I heard there was going to be a movie made and can't wait to see it!
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|I see a sort of repeated pattern taking place in how Madonna can make a great recording and then follow it with something less than what she offered before. 1998's Ray of Light was one of the highlights of her career, but then she followed in 2000 with Music, which was mostly terrible except for a couple of songs like \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" and \\"Runaway Lover.\\" 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor was another gem, and now we have Hard Candy, which does not rate as good as her last though is thankfully better than her Music release. \\"Candy Shop\\" is also a better opening track than the title song to \\"Music,\\" and gives the listener a taste as to what you'll hear throughout Madonna's newest collection--her dance style complemented by hip-hop grooves and romping beats. I can admire Madonna for paying an ode to what's trendy instead of setting trends herself, and Hard Candy has some good moments with some great songs. The songs that make this release worthwhile are \\"Give it 2 Me,\\" a great collaboration of styles as it is arranged perfectly without sounding overproduced plus ends up being one of the few songs that sounds like the typical Madonna dance groove we all know and love. \\"Heartbeat\\" is good, while \\"She's Not Me,\\" is a strong track as the fusion of Madonna's pop songstress style fuses very well with a chic, urban sound. \\"Incredible,\\" is a gem during the first four minutes as Madonna sings in a dynamic pop vocal, \\"When everything goes incredible and all is beautiful, can't get my head around it, I need to think about it, can't get my head around it,\\" but the song changes course for the last two minutes and almost loses it's spark when a thumping rap beat kicks in along with a constant course of male voices going, \\"Ooh, ooh, ooh,\\" indicative of how this release has some weak spots and many by virtue of the loose, overproduced sound. But \\"Beat Goes On,\\" works great and the rap bit helps to complete the song. One of the weakest songs on this album is \\"4 Minutes,\\" a true wasteof four minutes as this song sounds nothing more like a track that never made the final cut of Justin Timberlake's last album, so they decided to revamp it with some of Madonna's voice blended in, which you can barely hear. Not that Timberlake's other contributions on this recording are unworthy, but \\"4 Minutes\\" is really out of place. The last few songs on Hard Candy don't gel that good and become forgettable, while the cover of this release alone also weakens the album and not just because of the subtle reminder of Madonna's \\"Erotica,\\" era, which by far remains to be one of the worst recordings of her career. In a word, the cover of this release is \\"Hideous.\\" I find it a shame after all this time and with all her talent and range how Madonna still feels compelled to front herself in such a stupid fashion. Yes, I read about her idea with the concept of Hard Candy and how she wanted to create a contrast with something that was the opposite of sweet, but there's a fine line between artistry and attention-seeking and Madonna has crossed it again. As this woman is approaching 50, the fact that she chooses to issue such a stupid album cover indicates that she's still dealing with some unresolved issues.

0743289684|5.0|Ms. Hirsi Ali is an amazing woman and at the top of my list of heroes.  She struggled against religious oppression and sexism by leaving her home, her family, her community, her country.  Having developed an exemplary life and career in the Netherlands, She learned English, became a member of the Dutch parliament, yet she didn't sit back and enjoy her new life of freedom, which she had worked so hard and risked her life to attain.  Instead, she became an articulate writer speaking out against Islam, making her a target for murder by radical Islamists and causing her to have to leave the Netherlands and live her life under armed guard.  She did this in an attempt to educate others about the reality of Islam and to speak out on behalf of women, who are enslaved within Islamic countries because of religious beliefs.  Ms. Hirsi Ali is a hero for sacrificing her own freedom in an effort to end the enslavement of others.  The book is a real eye opener and a must read if one wishes insight into the Middle East.
0595440096|5.0|When Dr. Alice Howland first starts forgetting things like words when giving a speech, she thinks it might be because of menopause. But when she gets lost jogging near her house, on a route she has taken many times, she knows something is seriously wrong and seeks medical help. Not quite fifty, she is totally unprepared for the diagnosis - early onset Alzheimer's. As the disease progresses, Alice and her husband John learn everything they can about the disease and treatments, but Alzheimer's quickly takes its toll on both Alice and her family.<br /><br />\\"Still Alice\\" is a beautifully written, heartbreaking novel about the devastating affect Alzheimer's has on its victims and their families. Author Lisa Genova's choice of Alice - young, in shape, and intelligent (she's a Psychiatry Professor at Harvard) - shows that Alzheimer's can strike anyone, not just the elderly. The book is written from Alice's viewpoint, but Genova does a good job of showing the affect of Alzheimer's not only on Alice, but how her family (John, and their children - Anna, Tom, and Lydia) struggle with the changes in Alice. Genova does an excellent job of describing what is going on in Alice's head as the dementia increases. In fact, Genova does such a good job that I sometimes forgot the book was fiction and not about a real person.<br /><br />\\"Still Alice\\" takes place over a relatively short period of time (September 2002 to September 2005) and it is frightening how fast the Alzheimer's takes over Alice. Genova skillfully captures the bewilderment Alice feels and there are some moments in the book that are very moving - especially a moment involving a black rug and a moment involving a message a healthier Alice left for a sicker Alice. The reaction of Alice's family as they deal not only with her having Alzheimer's but the fact that her children may inherit the disease is very realistic. Inevitably, of course, life goes on and Genova expertly shows Alice's family as they move on with their lives, even if readers won't always agree with their actions. If I have any quibble with the book, it's that it is one chapter too long - the second to last chapter ended on a poignant note and I think Genova should have stopped the book there.<br /><br />\\"Still Alice\\" is a moving tale about the devastating affect Alzheimer's can have on a family.

0307265730|5.0|Another fantastic book from Jhumpa Lahiri. Just a joy to read and so sad when it's finished!
0061245097|5.0|I really liked this book.  I thought it was a great followup to the original story and had a satisfactory, open, ending that will easily lead into the next book (I HOPE!).  Great love scenes and great fight scenes.  The author really fleshed out (haha) Cat's team and I like them as much as I like Bones.  Great characters, story ties together well with the first book and gave enough info to set us up for the next one.  I highly recommend this book - but read the first one first or you'll miss some great jokes.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I have suffered through almsot a decade of sub-par albums from my favorite band hoping to relive the glory days of Murmer, Green, Out of Time, and Automatic for the People.  This album finds them focused and firey for the first time in years.  It is great to hear how even Michael Stipe has evolved and changed as a singer and songwriter, and yet, still manages to stay exactly the same as he always was.  This is a beautiful album and a great example of why sometimes, you don't just download one song; you listen to the entire thing begining to end.  There is something new to find with each listen, and that is what a good album is all about.
0440419514|5.0|The story is imaginative and brilliant. The author combines a child's deepest feeling about friendship and closeness into an adventure tale.  Absolutely magical and a great read for children and adults with imaginations.  Don't miss these tales. They will become classics.
B000U618C8|1.0|I have been a captive listener to this album for two weeks now, it has been played in my workplace, by someone else! I have had a good chance to listen to this album repeatedly.<br /><br />I have to say that this album lack even the slightest trace of emotion, let alone passion. It really does sound like Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez is simply \\"going through the motions\\" on each song, as mechanically and as passionlessly as possible. His vocal timbre is vaguely reminiscent of the Jos&eacute; Feliciano, but Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez lacks the finesse, fire, style and power of the great Feliciano.<br /><br />The cover of Massive Attack's \\"Teardrop\\" is one of the album's low points. Elizabeth Frazer sang the song with no small degree of tension and &eacute;lan. I can never understand a bloody word she sings, but she can and does move me with her interpretations. Mr. Jos&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez does not make the text of the song any clearly, but he does manage to make the song sound profoundly monotonous and exorcises any emotional content from it. Most of the rest of the album is delivered in the same dull, disinterested and depressingly listless way.<br /><br />The instrumental accompaniment to the voice is provided by an acoustic guitar, which is played in a serviceable, but wholly unremarkable way. I am not sure what one is supposed to do with this album? The lyrics are hardly profound, the singing isn't \\"moving\\" in the slightest, it would make very jejune \\"chill-out\\" music, very prosaic and irritating \\"background\\" music, annoying caf&eacute; music, one couldn't dance to this album and it is hardly the stuff of teenage rebellion or rebellion of any sort! What did Mr. Gonz&aacute;lez hope to achieve with this album? Just sell as many units as possible? I guess that that can be an achievement of sorts.<br /><br />I think that this is a first! A \\"Latino\\" album completely devoid of passion and fire, in fact, completely devoid of any emotional content whatsoever!
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a challenging workout.  It's nice because it's just 20 minutes, but you will be sweating heavily when you are done.  Jillian gets the job done and it's interesting she let's her two partners do most of the real work.  I did find that if I really wanted to push myself I did more than one session at a time to make it longer.  I also added heavier weights so you can adjust the intensity.  To give you an idea of the intensity, I work out 5 times a week by using this DVD and running, so it would be killer for someone just starting out, but a great tool to really kick start a training.
B00005JPS7|4.0|\\"Iron Man\\" Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Directed by Jon Favreau<br /><br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is head of the extremely successful weapons manufacturer Stark Industries. Tony heads to Afghanistan for a demonstration of his latest creation. Unfortunately on the return trip Stark's military convoy is attacked and Tony is taken captive. His captors demand that he build a missile for them. Tony discovers much to his dismay, that the militia that has captured him is well armed with weapons from none other Stark Industries. His former cavalier attitude about his weapons changes and he decides to move his company into a different direction but first he has to create his means of escape...<br /><br />This was another great addition to the Marvel stable. I can't speak for the die hard Ironman fans about how true the movie is to the comics (I was always a Wolverine Fan) but I think overall the story was well told and well thought out.<br /><br />The Good: I was a little bit skeptical at first but Robert Downey Jr. actually portrayed the Tony Stark Character very well. The movie overall was well cast. I think Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for her role as Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges (formerly the Dude) was very convincing in his role as Obidiah Stane. As always look for Stan Lee to make a cameo but this time he actually plays a known person and it was pretty funny even though very brief.<br /><br />The special effects and action sequences didn't disappoint. The flight sequences were all very fast paced and had good intensity. The suit was very well done and stayed true to the comics from what I've seen.<br /><br />The sound track was also good with tracks from A/C D/C, Black Sabeth and Suicidal tendencies.<br /><br />The Bad: For me nothing. As I said if you are a die hard fan you won't be able to help yourself at picking apart any inaccuracies from the comic to movie translation. There was a little bit of shamless Audi product placement but that is to be expected.<br /><br />Overall: This was another great addition to the Marvel stable. If you are interested in comic based movies got out and see \\"Ironman\\"!the Marvel stable. If you are interested in comic based movies got out and see \\"Ironman\\"!
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Amy's \\"Frank\\" cd.  I purchased it after buying Back to Black and after listening to bits of it on Amazon.  I found Frank a little lighter than Back to Black and it kinda has a slight hip hop/R&B feel.  I can honesly say I LOVE every song except one, and that one isn't that bad.  My favorite song is Stronger Than Me.  Amy always tells it like it is...lol.  I am totally an Amy fan.  I pray that she gets her personal life together.

B000N4SADM|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Hiromi Uehara for several years even though I'm not the biggest fan of some of her albums. Don't get me wrong, she is a HUGE talent and it baffles me that most of the world hasn't woken up to discover her. Hiromi is very impressive on her current album. Her sound still remains in tact; blazing rythmic chops that don't come out too jumbled. This is my favorite album by far. I liked it right away. There are moments where I hear Mahavishmu Orchestra, Brand X, James Hurt, Weather Report, Pat Metheny etc.     As a drummer, Martin Valihora is EXTREMELY impressive on this album. I especially enjoy his Drum & Bass licks at the beginning of Time Travel.      Buy this album but more importantly watch these musicians live! Hiromi is an amazing colorful performer. She's uplifting, energetic and very passionate about her music.

0140544518|5.0|The story, The True Story Of The Three Little Pigs by Jon Scieszka is about a wolf named Alexander T.Wolf and three little pigs. People think they know the story of the three little pigs but everything is all wrong. This is the \\"real\\" story of the three little pigs.  Once upon a time there was a wolf that was making a birthday cake for his granny.  But he didn't have a cup of sugar so he went to ask his neighbor who was a pig.  The first pig made his house out of straws.   He wasn't too smart.    Alexander knocked on the door but nobody answered.   Then, Alexander called \\"Little pig, little pig are you home?\\"   But nobody answered. The wolf was about to go home without any sugar for his  granny's birthday cake.   Alexander sneezed a great sneeze.   And then he saw the first pig had dead.     Alexander said \\"We can't leave a great dinner here.\\"   So you know what he did?   He ate dinner.   But still he didn't have a cup of sugar for his granny.   So he went to the first pig's brother who was a little smarter then the first pig.   He built his house and said, Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig are you here?   Pig said, \\"Go away, I am shaving the hair on my chinny, chin chin\\".   Alexander said, \\"Could I have a cup of sugar?\\"    But the pig said he was too busy.   He sneezed and sneezed.   That sneeze broke the house down.   The second pig was dead so you know what Alexander did?   He had dinner again.   But he still didn't have a cup of sugar.   So he went to the other pig brother.   Alexander knocked on the door and said \\"Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig are you in?\\"   The third pig said \\"Get out of here.\\" \\"Mr. Pig can you gave me a cup of sugar for my dear old granny's birthday cake?\\" But the pig didn't give him anything.   Then the wolf sneezed and sneezed but the house didn't fall over.   Then the third pig was so smart because he made his house out of bricks.   The pig said, \\"Your old granny can sit in pin. But Alexander never let anyone talk about granny like that.   When someone talks about hisgranny he goes crazy.   Then the cops saw the wolf go crazy they thought he was dangerous so they put him in jail and the newspapers.         I think the pigs did have a cup of sugar.   I don't think the house was falling because he sneezed.  Who could break a house down just by sneezing?     He says he is a good wolf but he is really not.   I don't think the pigs were dead.   Maybe they just fainted and the wolf ate them anyways.   I think other people will enjoy this book because Alexander is lying but people will notice right away.    By Abby M.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The Staatssicherheit (Stasi) secret police played a HUGE role in the lives of many people in the former GDR (East Germany), controlling every aspect of their lives. Artists, writers and other \\"intellectuals\\" were under strict surveillance and often their friends and lovers were involved in the spying.  The film is a good look at how the system worked and how one man had a change of heart.    I saw the German version and wanted my mother to be able to see the film, hence the English-language edition.

B000K15VSA|5.0|I bought the five disc ultimate edition having never seen Blade Runner before.  Then I watched each version, and now I absolutely love it.  I've seen all the features save for disc 2's bonus thing.<br /><br />But here's my complaint... I spent 50 dollars, to get this, and I get two original versions (US and International), a Director's Cut, a Final Cut, and a SUPER DUPER RARE ULTRA AWESOME Workprint Release... and it's all the same.<br /><br />The cuts have no differences in scenes.  The only major differences are sorted into two camps: crappy happy ending and Ford's voiceover narration (US and International), and noirish ending without voiceover narration (everything else).<br /><br />The other differences are so miniscule you'd barely notice.  Aside from digital enhancing and such, they've done little more than tweak and move things around, change some things here, fix other things, \\"restore\\" things that you would barely even notice if they didn't boldly proclaim it, fix some dialogue that leaves the fate of the fifth and sixth replicants unknown, as well spending who knows how much money on SUPER DUPER AWESOME TECHNOLOGY just to get Harrison Ford's son to come in, mouth some dialogue, and digitally place his mouth over Deckard's during the scene where he questions the snake dealer, because apparently his mouth didn't originally sync up with the dialogue.<br /><br />As great a movie as this is, and whichever version you prefer (sadly for me, I hate the happy ending, love the Director's Cut ending, and yet I hate the lack of narration, preferring the feel it gives to the film), it's simply not a very good deal to spend 50 dollars for a fifth version of the same thing you get in four other versions of the movie.
0671015206|5.0|A Great book with expert advice- too many charts, but the case histories were great and wonderful advice for parents tempted to spoil their children by financing their lives after they are finished with their education. Married children get to living way beyond their means and then resent it when parents stop paying  10 to 20 thousand a month for them.  It is clear that those who succeed do it better when they are responsible for their OWN finances and learn to live within their budget.
B00006GJ9N|5.0|This is the best single CD Elvis greatest hits collection available. It includes Elvis' biggest hits from the US and UK. All the songs on this set hit number 1 in either the US or UK or both, including the remix of his classic \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" which went to number 1 in the UK (and stayed there for 4 weeks) and several other countries in 2002. This set spans almost his entire career from his first international hit in 1956, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", right on through the last single to be released before his death in 1977, \\"Way Down\\". In between you get classics like \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"All Shook Up\\", \\"Jailhouse Rock\\", \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\", \\"In the Ghetto\\", \\"Suspicious Minds\\", and \\"Burning Love\\"! Just about every song is a classic.<br /><br />This release includes a bonus CD with various mixes of \\"A Little Less Conversation\\".  While this is a nice package, it is kind of pricey.  You can get the US release much cheaper.

1416562591|5.0|White Tiger by Aravind Adiga is the compelling story of an Indian man trying to break free of societal chains and expectations. Balram Halwai lived in the Darkness, a small village, in India under the thumb of his grandmother and the rules of his culture, until he is hired as the driver for a landlord who brings him into the Light of Delhi. The story is told through a letter Balram is writing to a Chinese official to show him entrepreneurial spirit. Balram is intelligent, which gains him the nickname White Tiger in his home town, but because of his family name and no education, he can expect nothing greater than being a virtual slave to his boss. He has dreams of something, anything different than the life laid out in front of him, but they only begin to take root when his boss changes. As long as his boss is honorable in his actions to Balram, he can accept his lot in life, but when the man starts abusing him and sleeping with prostitutes, Balram sees that he is just as corrupt as the rest of the system and decides to break free, utilizing violence to do so. Despite Balram's deplorable behavior, you can't help but root for him and want him to break the cycle of back-breaking labor and destitute poverty that has followed his family for generations. He's a funny narrator whose descriptions of both monetary and moral poverty alternately make you laugh and cry. Adiga is a fresh voice and a stellar writer.
B000V7O0GM|4.0|I had already seen \\"Infernal Affairs\\" the picture on which this Oscar winner was based and I still liked the film despite Jack's over-blown caricature of a performance.  Transferring the Chinese triads to the Irish mob was clever on the part of the screenwriter, another Irishman and Scorsese has done a masterful job of combining his themes of loyalty and betrayal into this gangster film.  The HD-DVD version is excellent with fine details in contrast & color (you can see the knits in Damon's shirt in the beginning of the film!!).  I personally preferred \\"The Aviator\\" (also starring DeCaprio) but I'm so glad this film won Best Picture & Director.  If you're a Scorsese fan or love gangster films, do check this out!!  It's an offer you can't refuse.
B00000AFDW|3.0|THE BAND: Paul Stanley (vocals, guitars), Gene Simmons (vocals, bass), Ace Frehley (guitars), Peter Criss (drums).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1998) 10 tracks clocking in at approximately 44 minutes. Included with the disc is a 4-page foldout containing song titles/credits/times, song lyrics, and production notes. The disc is enhanced - containing a screen saver, misc Kiss info and a Kiss-On-Line connection. There are several versions of the album - an import with one bonus track (a Simmons tune \\"In Your Face\\" sung by Ace Frehley), as well as a Japan/Europe/Brazil (only) 2-disc version with 2nd disc containing 6 live tracks (including 3 live songs from \\"Psycho Circus\\"). Label - Mercury Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I wanted to like this album from day 1 (Sept 22, 1998). I've been following Kiss in dark allies for over 3 decades and learning the original 4 members were once again getting together was a large-scale thing for me. Not since \\"Dynasty\\" (1979) has this happened... so we're led to believe. \\"Psycho Circus\\" hit the street running - hitting Gold status and reaching #3 on Billboard's Top 200 albums chart upon release. The ride didn't last though - as the album is marred by things that are simply not on the up-and-up. Mainly - all 4 original members are listed as the musicians on \\"Psycho Circus\\". However, several credible sources list Peter Criss playing drums on only 1 song, as well as Ace Frehley playing guitar on only 2 songs. Truth - tracks are recorded on this album by uncredited players. Tommy Thayer and Bruce Kulick assisted with guitars, and Kevin Valentine assisted on most of the drumming. Not to mention the songs themselves - several of the tracks have multiple song writing credits, but not once do you see Stanley's & Simmons' names together... the original 4 hooked up separately with others - including Bob Ezrin, Curtis Cuomo, Karl Cochran, Holly Knight and Bruce Kulick. Looking from the outside in, it appears that Paul and Gene had a few songs written on their own, they asked Peter and Ace to each write a song, and they threw an album together in the hopes that if it did well - a reunion tour would follow.  This is not a collaborative Kiss album in the true sense of the word. With that being said though, \\"Psycho Circus\\" does contain some choice cuts here. Highlights include an amazing 1-2 punch of the crunchy guitars and Stanley's whaling vocals on the title track followed by Simmons' best song in over a decade (including a backwards intro), the slow and methodic \\"Within\\". Ace's rocker \\"Into The Void\\" (feels like your back in 1978 - taken right from his first solo album); Gene's light and incredibly melodic \\"We Are One\\"; the 4 originals singing on the somewhat silly but upbeat \\"You Wanted The Best\\"; and perhaps the heavy \\"Dreamin'\\" - sounding like a leftover from \\"Carnival Of Souls\\" (1997). The album starts out nicely but then quickly fizzles. If this were a vinyl album, side 2 would rival \\"Unmasked\\" - just plain bad. Peter's oh-so-sad acoustic ballad \\"I Finally Found My Way\\" is self-pity trash. Ultimately, Kiss fans will want \\"Psycho Circus\\" in their collection. It certainly won't be the first album they reach when they need a Kiss fix... it might not even be the tenth Kiss album they reach for... but they will stretch for this one on ocassion... even if just to listen to the first half of the disc (3 stars).sked Peter and Ace to each write a song, and they threw an album together in the hopes that if it did well - a reunion tour would follow.

072325804X|3.0|While this is a beautiful anthology, I find that my children never choose to read it or look at it themselves because it is simply too heavy and bulky for little hands.  It's heavy to hold while laying down reading before bed, so I don't tend to pick it as a read-aloud either.  The binding has also broken loose from the pages, caused by a very little girl trying to carry the book by the front cover!  I've decided to break down and get the individual boxed set of stories so that we will actually read them!
B000002KMY|5.0|THE BAND: Ronnie James Dio (vocals), Tony Iommi (guitars), Geezer Butler (bass), Geoff Nicholls (keyboards), Vinnie Appice (drums and percussion) - replacing original drummer Bill Ward.<br /><br />THE DISC: (1981) 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 40 minutes. Included with the disc is a minimal 2-page foldout containing song titles/credits/times, band members and thank you's (no photo or song lyrics). This is the band's tenth studio album (and Dio's 2nd with Sabbath). Recorded at the Record Plant (Los Angeles). Album cover artwork by the famed Greg Hildebrandt (with twin brother Tim, they created the artwork for the original Lord Of The Rings - circa 1970's, the Star Wars posters and assorted Marvel comics). Label - Warner Bros / Vertigo Records (UK).<br /><br />COMMETS: As much as I liked \\"Heaven And Hell\\" (1980), I always thought \\"Mob Rules\\" was more of a complete album. Keep in mind - both albums are outright Dio/Sabbath classics. Ronnie James Dio was clearly in his prime - a five year stint with Rainbow, two classic albums with Black Sabbath, and then his solo career taking off with \\"Holy Diver\\" (1983). Somehow I feel \\"Mob Rules\\" got the short end of the stick being stuck between two monstrous albums. From the opening cymbal crashes on \\"Turn Up The Night\\", this album rocks. This opening track really kicks the album off to a great start. The lone single \\"Voodoo\\" is a slower track with ultra heavy drums. Both tracks have trademark Iommi guitars - rhythm and solos. The 8-minute masterpiece - \\"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\\" - is one of handful of Dio's best tunes (with ANY band). * How did Sabbath's compilation, \\"The Dio Years\\" (2007), miss this single most important song? A sluggish beat, trodden and heavy, cool guitars and effects, and stunning Dio vocals. \\"E5150\\" is a 2+ minute experiment with sound effects and guitars... ultimately the only track deemed skippable. Where \\"E5150\\" almost lulls you to sleep, it's all for naught as the following fast-paced title track kicks you in the teeth. \\"Country Girl\\" is a mid-tempo rocker... strangely, about love and desire. \\"Slipping Away\\" has some cool rhythm sections complete with dueling lead and bass guitars. \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\" has a delicate and misleading intro... only to break into a fast middle and ending. The album closes on a slow but emotional note with \\"Over And Over\\" (including a shredding guitar solo). For me, this album quietly rivaled anything in Black Sabbath's catalog (5 stars).in the teeth. \\"Country Girl\\" is a mid-tempo rocker... strangely, about love and desire. \\"Slipping Away\\" has some cool rhythm sections complete with dueling lead and bass guitars. \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\" has a delicate and misleading intro... only to break into a fast middle and ending.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|It's really kind of funny.  All of these concerns about the \\"real\\" Madonna.  Was there anything ever real about her?  She has always been a product of the moment.  Sometimes one of it's very best products.  Hard Candy is a great, FUN album.  Nothing more.  Some of it is silly.  Some of it is derivative.  But as a whole, this is one of her best records to date.  Except for Spanish Lesson, nothing on the album disappoints.  It makes me smile.  It makes my friends smile.  And THAT makes it an excellent product for the time!
B00139XZF4|5.0|A spectacular rendering of Philip Pullman's magnificent world(s), this is the closest that a movie has been able to match the imagery that the author's words created in my mind. The graphics and special effects were absolutely spectacular, to say the least, and the casting was perfect.<br /><br />Sadly though, the main meaning of the book was stripped down to it's bare minimum and the complex story was chopped up and dumbed down. I give it 5 out of 5 stars simply for the experience of seeing what I imagined on the silver screen. I recommend this to any one who enjoys a good piece of eye candy every now and again, but I must compel anyone who seriously wants the intellectual experience of this tale to READ THE BOOK FIRST. I simply can not wait for the Subtle Knife...
0765348780|3.0|Too many characters with too many changes of narrative with too many societies/cultures/races and subplots. I like ensemble story telling and plot twists and am a huge fan of GRRM, but this goes over the top. Frankly, it collapses under it's own weight for a while until the author thins things out towards the end. I liked the intermixing of gods and mortals - very Greek. But with all of the changes in narrative and all of the races/cultures/societies, etc to keep track of, it was difficult to really develop a love for the characters. The authors style reminded me a little of Gene Wolfe - sometimes the characters disappear or have strange experiences that ultimately distract or detract from the story telling.     If you like Gene Wolfe or the Gormenghast novels, you will probably love this book - I could only manage to like it.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|A good album! Perhaps her best since Music.    If there is one thing we are used to get from Madonna, that thing is that one album is always different from its predecessors, and \\"Hard Candy\\" continues this chameleonic tendency.    After \\"Bedtime Stories\\" no one was expecting a \\"Ray of Light\\" and after this last one no one thought she would be doing \\"Music\\". After the introspective \\"American Life\\" no one was expecting a dance and party till you die \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" and following that one, I'm sure \\"Hard Candy\\" comes again as a surprise to most of us.    We are not used to see Madonna collaborating with stars pairing with her in popularity, and by know I think everyone came to the conclusion that Madonna used Britney as a trampoline to bounce her back to stardom after her lesser hit \\"American Life\\" album. This time, tough, she summoned (yeah, she summons! She doesn't ask or beg) mainstream megastars Timbaland, Pharrell and Timberlake to give her a big push within the American market, from where she has been estranged for the past five years or so. Is this a sign Madonna is starting to need help to keep her on her queen of pop throne? Definitely not! This is another very smart move she made. If she has to share power with others, well so be it, as long as this allows her to keep a firm grasp on hers.    Most people would like Madonna's work to stand out from the rest, like she has done before, but fact is that nowadays listeners are not open to new sounds. It seems that hip-hop and urban rap are here to stay, at least until the end of this decade. Anyway, besides for being the queen of reinvention, Madonna is also known to be a commercial powerhouse. The only time she decided to \\"bjorkify\\" herself, she had two so-so hits: \\"Bedtime Stories\\" and \\"American Life\\" (yes, people ... hits! If something fails in the American market it doesn't mean it's a complete flop, and both these albums sold millions of copies worldwide), so I think she understood that at herage she could either go with the flow or die from exhaustion fighting the stream.    \\"Hard Candy\\" is very good and Madonna's pop is present everywhere, even if sometimes hidden by the very recognizable tunes created by those above mentioned collaborators. Madonna fans will not be disappointed and she will certainly be able to recapture a wider and younger audience with this work, something she was failing to do for some years now.    After nearly three decades out there, Madonna can still give us something new (at least when comparing to former works of hers) and can still create very enjoyable sounds good enough to keep her where she has been since \\"Like a Virgin\\" ... on top of the world.    I hope she continues out there for another five years at least. We all miss Tina Turner and her energy and we will lose and miss another iconic figure when Madonna decides it's time for her to let go. Everybody loves her or loves trashing her, but no one stays indifferent to her and her work. After she stops making the headlines, what are we really going to be left with? Who else can we still trace back to our diaper days that can still sell millions of albums and pack huge venues? Her farewell tour will be a sad event indeed, but, for now, listen to this new album and discover Madonna's eleventh reinvention like if it was her first.

B000UJ48SQ|4.0|When Stanley Kubrick's film BARRY LYNDON was released at the end of 1975, many people were probably expecting either something along the lines of DR. ZHIVAGO, or a raucous period piece in the manner of TOM JONES.  But giving people what they expect was never the stock-in-trade of this particular director, and instead he delivered a very clinical 18th century period study that, initially, was deemed a failure by critics.  And this being the dawn of the \\"Blockbuster\\" age in Hollywood, it failed to do particularly well at the box office, either in England or in America (making most of its money in Europe).    But as with so many of Kubrick's films, BARRY LYNDON has, over the years, come to be seen as a striking piece, worthy of the four Oscars it won in 1975 (Set Decoration; Musical Adaptation; Cinematography; Costume Design).  Ryan O'Neal stars as the title character, a charming but scheming kind of rake who goes up the ladder of 18th century society by fighting, lying, cheating, and being more or less a gold digger by the time he marries Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson).  He finds out what the limits are to what he is doing when he is confronted with a stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali), who knows about his stepfather's cruelty.    Based on William Makepeace Thackeray's somewhat obscure 1847 novel, BARRY LYNDON, along with EYES WIDE SHUT, is probably the most misunderstood film in Kubrick's entire oeuvure.  This is perhaps because this study of 18th century manners, complete with jaw-droppingly gorgeous nighttime candelight scenes shot by Kubrick's favorite cinematographer John Alcott, is fused with a deeply clinical, and even cynical, attitude about human nature.  Such was the way with Kubrick, at least in the eyes of the critics, particularly after 1960, when he left America to live and work in England (much of BARRY LYNDON was filmed in Ireland in 1973 and '74).  And as the cold and clinical way Kubrick made this film turned off one too many critics, so too did the extreme length of the film itself turn off audiences.  Even in 1975, attention spans were starting to shorten ever so gradually; and a three hour-plus film like BARRY LYNDON was likely to try even the most patient filmgoers.    But as mentioned before, time has given us a new perspective on this arguably odd duck in the Kubrick canon.  Though the casting of O'Neal in the title role was considered a misjudgment on Kubrick's part, in retrospect it now seems like the right one.  Berenson is also tremendous as Lady Lyndon; and Kubrick regulars Leonard Rossiter and Philip Stone turn in very professional performances as well.  The whole period atmosphere is shot through with a typical Kubrick touch in terms of the music--some of it is by the Chieftains, but most of it is by Baroque and Classical-era composers like Mozart, Vivaldi, Schubert, and Handel.  In particular, the adaptation of the D Minor \\"Sarabande\\" of Handel is used to grand and sometimes sinister effect.  For this, much of the credit must go to the late and often underrated Leonard Rosenman, who won one of this film's four Oscars for his adaptations.    Four stars may seem curiously low for a Kubrick film, but this is not to imply that BARRY LYNDON is a far lesser piece than 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or THE SHINING.  But it is a vastly different kind of film from this enigmatic and often controversial filmmaker; and like any of his films, it requires repeat viewings--a tall order here, admittedly, given its length.  In the end, though, the rewards are considerable.

A heralded \\"cure\\" for cancer ends up becoming a deadly virus that wipes out most of human life.  Worse, the virus transforms its victims into rampaging vampires.     (Don't you hate it when that happens?)  Bummer!    Will Smith is the sole survivor, or so he thought ... until he encounters a young woman and her child en route to a rumored survivor's colony in Vermont.  The special effects of post-apocalyptic New York City are arresting, visually evocative of the recent TV special, \\"Earth Without People.\\"    Can Smith find a cure for the virus?  Can he survive to discover it?  Will the woman and child make it to Vermont?  Will they find any \\"survivor colony\\" there or is it just a rumor?  You'll have to watch to find out.      This movie was better than I expected.      P.S.  The German Shepherd should get the Oscar for best supporting canine.

Also i really liked how the movie ended the climax was very well put together.

0064410935|5.0|I'm sharing this review with the intention of being particularly helpful to parents of toddlers and preschoolers. I found that having a very young child with the attention span to sit through chapters of a novel left me scrambling a bit to find novels that were appropriate in theme and content for her age. I am reviewing each novel we have read or tried in the hopes of being helpful to other parents in the same situation.    Charlotte's Web by EB White was the second novel we read, and we selected it for two reasons. First, it was already on our bookshelf, and second, an area park was planning to host the live-action movie, projected outside for a picnic-under-the-stars movie experience. I thought the second sounded really fun, and having seen the live action version, I thought my daughter would really enjoy it.    It was a bit of a gamble starting this one primarily because it tackles the concept of death, and a young three year old might not handle that well. But, knowing her as I do, I decided to try it on, and see how she responded. I decided that I'm not opposed to altering the story if I felt it necessary. Though I'm generally opposed to censorship, I feel this is fine, as I do not intend to keep ideas from her, merely gauge when she is ready for them. Regarding death, I felt that to some extent she had already been exposed to insect death, and that animal death is a natural extension of that idea. So, after noting the possible red-flags this novel brought with it, we began reading.    My daughter fell in love with this story. She considers it Fern's story, which I find interesting. The novel begins with Fern, and she is Wilbur's first advocate. I think she liked the idea of a pig all wrapped up in a baby blanket, in a doll's carriage, drinking milk from a bottle. I think she liked to experience being a caregiver vicariously through Fern. I saw confusion and shock flash across her face during the early scene when Fern rescued Wilbur from an early death. I think to some extent, Fern won my daughter's devotion in that early scene. Like Fern, the idea that this baby pig should be killed because it was small, was not only foreign but definitely wrong. It was neat to see her draw that conclusion, and empathize with a character on the basis of emotion and moral righteousness. In that passage, I knew we'd done right to select this book, and that it gave her the gift of literature in a way that previous reading hadn't. It gave her books as a vehicle for examining ideas and drawing conclusions, as a means of experiencing difficult situations without actually having to live them.    She very much enjoyed the antics of Charlotte, Wilbur, and Templeton. She was a quiet listener, so that often times I wondered if she was fully engaged, and was surprised to find upon questioning that she was definitely fully with me. I was surprised by how well she kept with the story, not growing bored when we covered long passages about the wind blowing through the trees and the seasons changing on the the farm. I'd have predicted that she would need the clever antics to keep her interest up, but she was a rapt audience for the entirety of the book.    In the end, we took Charlotte's death on headlong, not editing or softening the blow. I felt the whole book had prepared for it, and to leave it out or soften it in the end would have made the preparation excessive. White was very wise in his handling of the story. It is very much an introduction to the idea of death, and he puts out early the idea that Wilbur may die, an idea his audience is not equipped to handle. Still, he prepares the audience for it, never lying. Never promising that it won't become a reality, presenting hope alongside the reality of death, and leaving the reader to know that those are what we have: the certainty of ultimate death, and hope in the face of it. And I love that he didn't chicken out. He didn't give us Wilbur, the victor over death and a means to avoid dealing with death as a certainty. He gave us Wilbur, saved from the slaughterhouse and free to live as full a life as any of us. And he gave us Charlotte, whose complete life came to it's natural end in this book. In doing so, he asks the reader to explore the idea of death and of the life-cycle, without giving them a free-pass. He is honest about it, and I respect that. He recognized that children weren't ready to say good-bye to Wilbur, and most especially not at the hand of humans and not by choice, but that he had prepared them for the idea of death and a natural death could be more easily accepted and understood. And so, Charlotte dies, and Wilbur lives to die another day, and my daughter begins to explore this idea and to decide for herself what it means to have a life.    Lots of questions accompanied this book, and followed it. Why do the people want to kill Wilbur? Why do we eat animals? Why does Charlotte not want Wilbur to die? Why did the farmer decide not to kill Wilbur? Why did Charlotte die? Do people also die? Will I die? Will you die when I die? What will happen after I die? When will I die? When will you die? Are Charlotte's babies sad because they don't have a mommy? And so on. And they are all important questions and I thank EB White for giving them to my daughter in such a gentle and loving way and allowing us to experience them together.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Overall, I thought this was quite a good movie and very interesting.  Of course, given the cast, the performances are excellent.  I initially thought David Bowie an odd choice for Tesla, but ultimately decided he was perfect for the part.  Hugh Jackman is always a favorite, as is Michael Caine.  I've enjoyed Christian Bale in a few of his earlier films; however, in this film, I would have to agree with another reviewer who mentioned something about wanting to punch Bale's character in the face.  That was certainly my sentiment as well, which I suppose would mean Bale was very successful in his portrayal.      I will admit that I found the story a tad depressing, given how destructive the main characters' rivalry ultimately is to themselves and to the others around them.  Still, when is rivalry and revenge ever NOT destructive?  The maimings and deaths were rather disturbing to me, although I appreciated the fact that in two or three instances the camera didn't show much or showed it so quickly you really didn't see much of anything.  Despite the disturbing parts, I thought it was extremely well done and very intriguing.
B000GTJT0M|5.0|Movie was awesome the first time. Then I watched it in HDDVD,  WOW!!! Sure the picture is amazingly clear, but if you have a decent home theater system you can really tell the difference. A must have!
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Now when I watch a SD movie it looks washed out, HiDef is the only way for me, compare your old SD ID4 with the Blu Ray ID4, you will see the difference.
B0011QC9U6|5.0|This movie is phenomenal, top to bottom.  The story, performances and execution are essentially flawless.  There isn't a dull moment.  Reviews of this movie were mixed mostly because of the digital execution, but anyone who is not afraid of technology will simply be astounded scene after scene.  The 3D experience was one I will never forget and now that I own it in HD, it is one of the most frequently watched movies in my collection.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Loved seeing this again - the visual was better than before and the additional Special stuff was great!
B00154GEFU|3.0|Not bad effort, not anywhere near the debut as they claim it to be.  A lot of the songs SOUND like some of their other stuff but this beats the tar out of Silent Nation!
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|I have to agree, as a fan of REM from the early 80's, I watched this phenomenal band evolve to a place that made me long for the early days.  I love this album.  It is not a true return to the day but its a really great permutation of their earlier works. I am not too sure what their intention is but this CD rocks like no REM album has since before Green. I am running this disc through my car CD player over and over again.  My only question is \\"Why so short?\\" I swear it is all over way way too soon. Not only because I like the sound but it is a very short disc. Literally my brain is moving along with the sound and bam it is over. The disc left me wanting much more. I felt like I was being teased and left hanging. This is a five star CD with a three star length.
B000066C1N|5.0|First of all, let me just say that this is a great album! I love Bryan Adams. I bought it for my daughter who is a huge Spirit fan and it's one of the CDs we actually like listening to together! She's 6.    Secondly, this seller was great! No prob, no hassle, straight business and fast. That's the way I like it. Thanks a lot! You made one little birthday girl and mom very happy!

0143038583|4.0|\\"TOD\\" is not an easy read, and a takes a bit of time to get into, but it's incredibly absorbing. I learned a ton -- about where our food comes from, how it's made and processed, and how \\"organic\\" isn't really all that \\"organic\\" or necessarily good for the planet. Reading this book has changed my food choices for the better and really made me think about what I eat and select.     I'll tell you this -- I haven't had McDonald's in 9 months, and will never eat there again, not even in an emergency. (This healthy choice owed to this book, + the documentary \\"king corn,\\" which features Pollan; and \\"Super Size Me\\" and \\"Fast Food Nation,\\" which I also highly recommend.)     Buy this book, and eat healthy!

0792843584|1.0|I saw this movie when it originally came out. Over the years, whenever people talk about a bad movie and, invariably, will give their opinion on the worst movie they ever saw, I always mention this one as the worst ever made.  I describe it as people being shot by machine guns and then the bullet holes being shown close up.  They did this multiple times and it's all I can tell you about it because the storyline was so confusing.  I know it was about the cattle ranch wars but couldn't tell you much else because it made no sense.  Cinematography is all well and good and it can add much to a movie but it can't make a really (really, really) bad movie good no matter how beautifully it was shot.
0452289963|5.0|The very nature of nature is change.  If you're looking for an awakening transformation in your life this book has it!  Tolle is completely spot on.  If you're looking for your purpose in life this book makes the most sense.  I've studied NLP, transcendental meditation and so much more in hopes of finding out who I was.  This particular book was the portal for me.  Very life changing.  Tolle presents a way in which to deal with life and those in your life that completely opens one's eyes rather wide.  Acceptance, Enjoyment, Enthusiasm have all returned to my life and my world is wonderful.

B00005LC1H|5.0|got it, haven't watched it, but enjoyed watching the shows and my video copies in the past.
B000001E21|4.0|It's amazing to think that instead of releasing Adrenalize they could have released these songs along with \\"Tear It Down\\" and had the album out in 1990 instead of 1992.  \\"Ring of Fire\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Your Hero\\" were much too good to just be B-Sides for Hysteria.  \\"Desert Song\\" and \\"Fractured Love\\" are also great as is \\"She's Too Tough\\".  This really is more of a complete album than a rarities collection and these songs stand up to anything else they've released.  If you're a Def Leppard fan you need to own this album.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|well I have seen all 6 movies on Hi def, HBO ran them in october and all in 5.1DD, actually dont ask but I have all these on Dual layer DVD in Hi def and playable on a PS3 in the native AVC codec, they look and sound great, considering these releases are on the low end of the HD scale a blu ray release will be great(a higher AVC bitrate), but these will have to do until then.
B000H2M3TM|3.0|Girl, Interrupted is a pretty basic book. The author did not delve too deeply into her own depression or accompanying emotions. The writing seemed very basic, and it did not force me to think. I think that the author left a lot of things out-too many things out. I loved the movie, though.
0805079831|5.0|I was just finishing this book as the republican candidate for president was announcing his plan to solve the gasoline tax crisis with a repeal of the gas tax for the summer. This tax is dedicated to transportation infrastructure. He is on record for making the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy permanent while the costs of the Iraq war are estimated at three  trillion and the paper held by Japan and China. His solution for all this deficit is to cut spending elsewhere rather than to pay for war as we go.  This is the same game plan explained in this book used  from Chile to  Katrina. Manufacture or exploit a crisis and privatize legitimate government functions as a government is weakened.
B000001FKY|5.0|This was the first album I ever bought back in 1988.  I remember having my dad take me to the music store and him not understanding why they misspelled \\"deaf\\" and \\"leopard\\" in the band's name.  Anyway, I wore this tape out and I am still not tired of listening to it.  It's a more radio friendly version of Def Leppard as the harsh guitar tones have been replaced with the smooth effects-laden guitar tones of the mid to late 80's.  I really believe Phil Collen had a big impact on the sound of this record.  The style of guitar playing is very different from their earlier material.  Of course everyone knows the big hits from this album but really all of the songs are great with maybe the exception of \\"Excitable\\".  There is another amazing epic in \\"Gods of War\\", a great rocker in \\"Run Riot\\", and one of the best album closers in \\"Love and Affection\\".  It's a great mix of hard rock and pop that will never be duplicated.

B00005JPS7|5.0|Let me say: A lot of times I go to a movie with high expectations and, though the movie may be good, come out disappointed. I entered Iron Man with HIGH expectations, and came out as satisfied and awe struck as is possible.<br /><br />First, Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man. He positively owns the part, stealing the show in pretty much every scene he is in. However, let us not take away from the good performances given by the supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges. The acting is excellent, partly due to the screenplay, which is well paced and funny.<br /><br />With all the superhero movies coming out today, this one ran the risk of being too much like the others; not standing out enough. However, that risk was quickly abolished, in my mind, by a couple things:<br /><br />1. Robert Downey Jr. is so good as the title character...I just can't say it enough.<br /><br />2. The Iron Man armor is AWESOME!<br /><br />3. In my review for Batman Begins, I state the one of the reasons I like it was because the hero didn't actually posses super-human abilities. This one goes even farther in that way: This film is actually set in the real world. Instead of struggles in a city that doesn't exsist, Iron Man is set in the world we live, and therefore we can relate to the story more, as the enemies facing the hero are, more or less, the ones facing us today.<br /><br />Iron Man is my new favorite superhero, and he may very well become yours. Six stars.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|Director Tim Burton brings his own gloomy aesthetic to Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" in this cinematic adaptation. Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) returns to 19th century London with a deep bitterness toward his forced exile. Fifteen years ago, Todd was prosperous barber and happy family man. Prominent Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) coveted his wife and so sent Todd to prison on false charges. Now a defeated man, Todd wanders into the pie shop beneath his old barber shop, where the proprietress Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter) recognizes him and offers her assistance in plotting revenge...and hiding the bodies.<br /><br />As if a musical about a serial killer weren't odd enough, Burton has cast it with actors who normally don't sing. Nevertheless, Johnny Depp's punkish baritone impressed me. Helena Bonham-Carter is adequate. Sacha Baron Cohen is fun as a flamboyant rival barber. Jayne Wisener is far to shrill as Todd's long lost daughter Johanna. The film's aesthetic is too gray for its own good at times, and Mrs. Lovett's ghoulishness is overdone. But this macabre spectacle manages to be both comic and ultimately tragic. Todd's deathtrap of a barber chair is suspenseful as well as gratuitously gory. And Johnny Depp's interpretation of the tormented, unhinged Sweeney Todd is something to see.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner Brothers 2008 single disc): The single disc edition has only one bonus feature, a making-of documentary called \\"Burton + Depp + Carter = Todd\\" (26 min). Director Tim Burton, Stephen Sondheim, and the producers talk about the genesis of the project, casting and making a musical. The cast is interviewed about their roles and preparation. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, and Spanish. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.
B000001DVD|5.0|This is tied for my favorite Def Leppard album along with Hysteria.  Mutt Lange infused ideas from his days producing AC/DC with the more pop oriented and raw talent of early Def Leppard.  The result is an album that is raw and melodic.  Not quite heavy metal but it has enough big riffs for any metalhead to enjoy.  Def Leppard would never be this aggressive again but that's just what makes this album special.

B0010X8NF0|5.0|\\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" is a captivating entry in the already quirky canon of train movies, where the environment of the train itself is vital to the story. Motivated to bond with his brothers after a near-fatal accident, Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) arranges a trip to India for himself and brothers Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). The idea is make a \\"spiritual journey\\" of a cross-country train trip aboard The Darjeeling Limited, following a careful, laminated itinerary. But the brothers don't trust one another, for good reason, and Francis has kept their destination a secret.<br /><br />The Darjeeling Limited is a functional train created for this movie, which was filmed aboard the moving train. There couldn't be a better advertisement for Indian tourism. The train is absolutely charming, with handpainted artwork adorning the corridors, colorful, tasseled chandeliers in the dining car, and a profusion of lovely cobalt blue everywhere. I have no idea if this remotely resembles a real Indian train. It seems like an exotic, whimsical version of a European train from the pre-World War II era. But the production design by Mark Friedberg is a true gem, not to be missed.<br /><br />\\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" has a low-key, slightly bemused, wryly comic, but good-natured tone, to which I attribute its success. It's familiar, but I have never seen a film able to sustain this tone for the duration. It doesn't slip even as the characters' situation vacillates from comic to tragic, or when they get off the train. Even the humor doesn't interrupt the flow, which is aided by a great soundtrack. I found it all pleasantly hypnotic. The visuals are beautiful. The odd characters seem utterly natural in this environment. This is the best role for Adrien Brody since \\"The Pianist\\". Wes Anderson's films are hit-or-miss for me, but this one is a hit.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2008): You have the option of viewing the film with a prelude entitled \\"Hotel Chevalier\\" (12 min). It concerns an encounter between Jack and his girlfriend in a Paris hotel room. It's superfluous and would create a hiccough in the film's pacing. I strongly recommend viewing the film without it. You can always watch it afterward. There is also a making-of featurette called \\"The Darjeeling Limited Walking Tour\\" (21 min). Production designer Mark Friedberg shows us around the train, and there is behind-the-scenes footage of filming. And there is a theatrical trailer (2 min). Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish.erns an encounter between Jack and his girlfriend in a Paris hotel room.

B000001F7R|4.0|I first bought this album back in the late 80's after wearing out my cassette tapes of High 'N' Dry, Pyromania and Hysteria.  I was a little surprised by the sound of the album but still enjoyed it.  Today, I think this is a case of an album aging well and as the years pass it doesn't seem so out of place in the band's catalogue.  Since the release of Yeah! and Songs from the Sparkle Lounge you can really start to get a picture of where the band was coming from in the late 70's.  The album is filled with great riffs by Clark and Willis and features decent vocals by Elliott who really hadn't found his voice yet.  Overall it should be a staple of any Def Leppard fan's collection.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|\\"The Lives of the Others\\" paints an excellent picture of recent German history, when the East German Stasi (secret police) made it their business to know what each and every one of their 17 million citizens was thinking, who was critisizing the Communist Government and worse yet,was considering \\"Republikflucht\\" (escape from the Republic), which landed you in jail for years.   More than just providing an excellent historical review, this movie makes it chillingly clear what happens if the government infringes more and more on your rights to free speech and independent thought... which could happen in every country...

B0013FXWU6|4.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is Paul Thomas Anderson's loose interpretation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel \\"Oil!\\". In this version, prospector Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) sets out to become an oil magnate in turn-of-the-century California. He aggressively obtains drilling rights from landowners under somewhat dubious terms and pays them a royalty. In 1911, a man from the town of New Boston sells Daniel information about oil on his family ranch. With his young son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), Daniel sets out to buy all the land he can get in New Boston before his competitors do. But his promises to bring prosperity to the town must compete with charismatic local religious demagogue Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) for the hearts and souls of the citizens.<br /><br />\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is entertaining for about two-thirds of its 2 hour 38 minute run time. We spend the first 15 minutes watching Daniel prospect for silver and oil, to give you some idea of the pace. The story is not in any way realistic beyond the naturalistic production design, and the last third goes too far over the top to sustain credibility. As is typical of Paul Thomas Anderson, who wrote as well as directed this film, it's not clear just what the film is supposed to be. Every scene unfolds with gravity, but the endless power struggle between Daniel and Eli is black comedy. Daniel Day Lewis' Oscar-winning performance is not realistic, but rather an affected acting style that is suited to the film's dark humor and implausible behavior.<br /><br />We seem to have a black comedy and a character study that is hardly believable, presented as epic drama. It makes very little sense. Daniel Day Lewis' histrionics must carry the entire film. And they do. Daniel Plainview believes in single-minded ambition for its own sake, and his venom is something to see. The conflict with Eli Sunday is perversely amusing. And young H.W., buffeted about by his father's goals, evokes the audience's sympathy. Mind you, they are in a plot whose parts do not coalesce. And beyond the director's low opinion of oilmen and preachers, there is no point, and for a while I thought there would be no end. But most of it is entertaining, so this is a big improvement as Paul Thomas Anderson's films go.do not coalesce.

B000001DV2|3.0|I think this album was doomed to fail.  You had a predecessor that could not be equalled yet the band was intent on matching it by essentially recording the same album over again.  On top of that you had original guitarist Steve Clark slowing drinking himself to death which he finally accomplished in 1991.  Mix that all up with the horrible state of hair metal in the early 90's and you have a problem.  People forget that bands like Poison, Winger, etc were still putting out albums and getting good record sales until 1992.  So out of all of this comes Adrenalize, the big follow-up to Hysteria.  When I first got it back in '92 I thought it was pretty good but a little cheesy.  Well, the album has not aged well.  Not at all.  In my opinion the album really only has two strong songs, \\"Tonight\\" and \\"White Lightning\\".  It has some songs that are good if you are in the right mood, \\"Tear it Down\\", \\"I Wanna Touch U\\", \\"Stand Up\\", etc.  And then it has some pure hair metal cheese in \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", \\"Heaven Is\\", \\"Make Love Like a Man\\".  In the last ten years I can honestly say I only listen to a handful of songs at a time on this record.  I just can't take listening to the whole thing.  A lot of people view \\"X\\" as the band's disaster but this album is worse.  Sure it sold well in 1992 but it made Def Leppard a joke in the music business and sent them down a strange path where each subsequent album they released was a direct reaction towards the previous one like they were trying to solve the problem of why they weren't popular anymore.  Well, this is the reason.  Adrenalize was a big cheeseball and although they've produced quality music since then this will always be the dark spot in their career.

A few months before the fall of the Berlin wall, Alex's mother suffers from a heart attack and falls into coma.

B00104W8T6|5.0|Great purchase. After I left the theater I knew I would have to buy the sound track! It goes very smooth on the ears, vey easy to listen. I bought one for me and one for the girlfriend, who haven`t seen the movie yet and already love it, just for the songs.    Wrapping it up, nice movie with a must have sound track! Go for it!
B000VBP382|5.0|I for one had never read the book, so I had no expectations regarding the film. Simply put, it was lush, romantic, funny and beautifully shot. Definitely a woman's movie!  I have since read the novel and loved every page of it. I must say though that I like the changes they made for the film. It just worked better visually. The soundtrack is lovely too. I love this collector's edition...it reminds me of one of Austen's books. The behind the scenes extras were interesting and brought much understanding to the time and culture as well.
0312379293|2.0|I really liked Kane and Abel.  I really liked some of Archer's later work.  But this book is plain endless.  I'm about 1/3 into it and it just drags.  The plot \\"twists\\" are telegraphed so clearly that they never come as surprises.  Either I've gotten a lot smarter since Archer started writing, or he's gotten a lot more formulaic.  And sad to say, I'm voting for the latter.  :(    There's plenty of great fiction out there.  If you like twists, pick up something by Harlan Coben.  If you like endless stories of revenge, read The Count of Monte Cristo.  At least it's a book that people will remember a year from now.

I think Pharrel Williams makes too many appearances through the album.  The version of \\"4 Minutes\\" is awesome-Timbaland at his best; she should have had him help her do more.  The beat of the songs and their ability to capture you and get you moving are true Madonna.  She's still awesome-buy the album!

B00139W3NE|5.0|On occasion producers, directors and screenwriters and all of the other hard working and dedicated people involved in an undertaking of this magnitude get it all right, and the result is a masterpiece of cinematography.  The story is a symbolic fantasy revolving around a young woman at the center of intrigue concerning the attempt by the murderous minions of the \\"Magisterium\\" to control all human thought and behaviour not only in this universe, but in ALL possible universes.  Strangely apropos vis a vis the current \\"many universe\\" theories of physicist David Deutsch and others, the story can be enjoyed by the young and by the young of heart and mind no matter of what physical age as the beautiful cinematography and music, and the well developed plot proceed at a suspenseful but well paced speed to the satisfying and exciting finale.<br /><br />I must say the author's spiritual conceptions are wonderfully imaginative and can be considered to be a part of the growing modern movement which introduces far greater tolerance of different spiritual conceptions than would have ever been allowed in the world of even the recent past.<br /><br />Outstanding movie... and, if your curiosity to learn more details was as mine, you will go out and buy the book - I am reading it with GREAT enjoyment right now!

B0013HA838|5.0|Before buying this DVD I was a bit reluctant of adding another version of this opera to my collection.  There are far too many versions of \\"Le Nozze\\" on DVD, some of them remarkably good and some others quite bad and unbereable.  However this new version of Covent Garden with the great David McVicar as stage director (remember Glyndebourne`s Giulio Cesare and Covent Garden`s Rigoletto) was very tempting for me to check.  At the end I was not dissapointed at all, not only because the clever and dynamic staging of David MacVicar but also because the talented cast that sings beautifully and also knows how to act. Musical and stage direction combine perfectly well to convey the feeling that you are discovering new, non traditional and hidden dimensions of a well known traditional opera.  It is particularly interesting the behind of the scenes in this DVD where David McVicar comments that all the action on stage is encoded in Mozart`s music.  Indeed, once more (like I previously commented in the case of Glyndebourne`s Giulio Cesare) at times you get the feeling that the music was composed after the staging and no the other way around. To listen at this new version of Le Nozze is a great experience.  Erwin Schrott`s voice is a strange melange of darkness and sweetness.  Dorothea Roschman is great as always (I am a big fan of this soprano so probably my judgment is a bit biased here).  Persson and Finlay are remarkably good as well in their respective roles as Susana (sweet and strong at the same time) and the Count Almaviva (mischievous and foolish at the same time). There is a great chemistry among the singers who are (obviously) having a great and relaxed fun on stage.  Their characters are completely flesh out, something quite unusual in the opera world.  This is not another version of Mozart`s Le Nozze di Figaro, this is a new multidimensional version of this traditional and beloved opera.  Highly recommended indeed.
0307387151|5.0|I couldn't put this novel down and read it in two sittings. Of the books I've read in the past few months, this is my favorite. The characters are extremely well-developed, and the plot is engaging and deeply moving.  I'm eager to read more by this writer who was new to me.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly is a fun mix of science fiction and western. Although the plot and the characters are formulaic, the formula works. It's well written, funny, and the actors are good.    For an ambitious, thoughtful show, look somewhere else, but if you just want to laugh and to be entertained, Firefly it is.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|I'm a long-standing admirer of the Alan Parsons Project and bought all of the original albums on vinyl in the early 1980s, only to purchase (and enjoy) them all over again in their first transition to CD about ten years later. Now we're into remastered and extended-play territory for these albums - but are the new versions worth buying?    'Emphatically yes', certainly where 'Eye in the Sky' is concerned. Though the original albums were famed for their technical prowess as well as their musical quality and originality, the remastering really works here, giving a new brightness to the music without detracting from the quality and feel of the original.     If this was just a remaster without additions, then, it would be worth buying, but it gains very considerably from the bonus tracks (which incidentally add 34 minutes to the play length). The pick of these, for me, is 'The Naked Eye'. As with the other APP remasters, the bonus tracks give a good insight into the original production process and show quite how meticulously the original album was refined and perfected.    Worth replacing your original-issue CD version? Definitely!
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Watching this thriller on home DVD was less of a tumbling somersault it was in the theater.  In addition, views of the monster were much more clear and that was a big plus.  The young people affected by this completely unexpected event in their lives somehow manage to cope.  I am not sure going to rescue the fair damsel from a building darn near fallen is a predictable reaction.  The only reason I give this film a four is that the ending is far too vague.  One does not know if the creature is killed or is still romping around Central Park and New York City.  There is plenty of room for a sequel, perhaps shot from the perspective of another person caught up in this nightmare.
B000FIMG68|4.0|Season two of Lost is quite enjoyable, but with some shortcomings.  Overall, the series is quite intelligent science fiction with tight writing and sophisticated character development.  Season two is not as successful when the flashbacks are redundant.  Some characters, like Jin and Sun and Locke, have flashbacks that continually reveal new information and story lines.  This keeps the show fresh and interesting.  Other character flashbacks, like Hurley and Charlie, rehash the same themes as season one making those episodes less interesting.  Claire's character also becomes really lame and whiny.  If all the characters had new themes to their flashbacks it would have been more engaging. The introduction of new characters like Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) were not that great.  Her character is too dominating and violent.  In Season two guns start to dominate the action elements of the show, which I do not care for. Part of the show's appeal was that it was \\"primitive\\" and the survivors had to be creative with what they used to survive.  Every show on TV these days seems to involve gun violence, and Lost starts to follow that clich&eacute;.  But, overall, the show remains well done and interesting and Season 3, and especially season 4 are great.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I've figured out that I am a huge fan of Sondheim. His signature progressions, his wit and the intelligence of his story lines have won me over. I thought the economy of John Doyle's Broadway production was brilliant--the austere sets and instrumentation threw the best of Sondheim into blazing relief. This version operates in diametric contrast.     I have to agree with all the people who've noted the darkness of Tim Burton's film. Within this inky landscape, however, the intricate, stage-like sets and costuming give the piece an unexpectedly tactile quality. We're watching something a bit like 3D chiaroscuro. I saw it as the perfect backdrop for the show's two stars, the music and Johnny Depp.     Paul Gemignani's sumptuous orchestration enfolds the listener. The sinuousness of the track belies an unblinking stare at anguished souls. Johnny Depp colors every note he sings with some shade of torment. Alan Rickman holds forth in the sonorous tones of practiced debauchery. Helena Bonham Carter makes an earnest effort; Sascha Baron Cohen amuses; and the rest of the cast performs admirably. But even when I recall this or that image of the movie, it's still the music, the music...and Johnny Depp...that abide.
0743454537|3.0|The set up for this novel is quite interesting - a child is conceived to be a donor for her sibling with leukemia.  The main characters and main story line is well crafted, sensitive, and interesting.  Each chapter switches voices amongst the characters which is well done and emotionally dynamic.<br /><br />The main complaint I have with this and other novels by Picoult is that she develops too many characters and story lines.  The novel already presents the perspective of Anna the organ donor, each of her parents, and her brother.  Their family is the central drama that the reader cares about.  But about a third of the way into the novel Picoult starts developing a story line involving Anna's social worker and her relationship with her own twin sister and with Anna's lawyer.  It is just way too much for the reader to care about, and seems really forced and added on.  I was so interested in the main story line that I was irritated to be drawn away from it by a boring love story with the lawyer and social worker.  It also makes the book too long and I found myself eventually skipping the chapters about the social worker since they were so dull.  With some serious editing this could have been a great novel.
B000AY807Q|5.0|I have watched the performance on cable several times and had to buy the DVD.  I have read reviews where some didn't like this album...didn't like what Neil Young had done.  I see this as a product of his maturation and professional evolution.  We all mellow out eventually and I love hearing this music.  Neil Young has traveled a long journey and this album was a welcome addition to my collection.  I never grow tired of it.

B0015D3Z4O|2.0|Ok so I have been a Madonna fan ever since I was a wee child in the early 80's. I did papers on her in High School that got me suspended, I have EVERY cd she ever put out, framed pictures that I hung up of her on my wall. I mean I adore and admire her more then the average fan, until now. All I can say is that I KNEW this cd was going to suck, I mean Justin Timberlake, Pharelle and Timberland? Please. They are all overrated and rather lame. All the music they produce from Aalyiah back in the day to new (and HORRID) Gwen Stefani and Nelly Furtado all sounds the same and is all rather disposable. Any chance this cd has is ruined by the stupid Gwen Stefaini like lame break downs that interrupt the song instead of adding to it. Her voice sounds horrid on this disk, the over producation kills any origionality this cd may have had.   I my opinion Madonna SOLD OUT, she walked the same path Nelly Furtado did which I was dumbfounded since for the first time in her career Madonna FOLLOWED the 'trend' instead of setting it. If this was her attempt to recapture her 'American' fan base then best of luck to her, her music has gotten SO MUCH BETTER since she moved over seas and I was hoping this would be a trend she continued, using producers from France, U.K. etc.  They lyrics on this cd are embarrassingly bad, I mean border line pathetic. All the songs sound the same and although I like 'Shes not me' the stupid Gwen Stefani break down ruins it. Although I like 'The beat goes on' Kanye Wests' HORRID 'rap' skills manage to ruin that song also. I like 'Voices' it reminds me of something off 'Erotica' and I also like 'The devil wouldn't recognize you' but its all to reminiscent of FutureSexLoveSounds which was a lame overrated piece of pop trash. IMO.  All in all this cd fails to deliver anything special, its boring, uninteresting, not heartfelt and just plain not good.   I am holding my breath that the 'real' Madonna comes back to play one day.
0143038419|5.0|I love everything about this book - the structure, the writing, the humor, the lessons learned.  Starting from the concept of the sacred number 108 beads on a prayer bead, the author divides her year's adventure into 3 segments of 36 little stories each.  She spends four months each in 3 places - Rome (\\"Eat\\"); India at an ashram (\\"Pray\\") and Bali (\\"Love\\").  She is funny and swept me along on her adventure.  I felt I was there with her, and that she is someone I would love to know, as she is so open about her personal journey.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|Cult films don't come much more groundbreaking than \\"Dark City\\" -- it was bending reality before the Matrix ever did.<br /><br />At first glance, Alex Proyas' movie seems like a basic sci-fi little-man-against-the-evil-night-aliens movie, with all the plot complexity that implies. But it isn't. Instead, it's a dark grimy nightmare where nothing is what it seems, and everything we think is real is just an elaborate illusion. This is one of the rare films that is creepy from start to finish.<br /><br />The Strangers are pasty-faced, bald, leather-coat-wearing aliens (think Darth Vader, post-mask), whose survival depends on somehow imitating human souls and dreams. So they created the Dark City, to observe and manipulate the unwitting humans.<br /><br />Our hero John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up naked in a tub, with no memory of who he is, and the police hunting him for brutal murders that he is sure he didn't commit. And worse, hes being pursued by the Strangers, without even knowing who they are or why they're after him.<br /><br />And then he starts seeing past the Strangers' illusions. Buildings are reshaped, people's memories change, and the sun never appears. As John searches for hints to his past, he finds that the places he knew never existed -- and it's connected to the Strangers. Now John and a suspicious cop will unravel the truth of the City -- and of why the Strangers want John.<br /><br />It's not surprising that \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Dark City\\" are often compared. They deal with an illusionary \\"real\\" world, malevolent manipulation, and one man who might be able to stop the bad guys. But \\"Dark City\\" is very much unique -- it's dark, angular, and haunted, like if Fritz Lang made a sci-fi noir with an eerie Philip K. Dick twist.<br /><br />The Dark City is a pretty creepy place, like a... well, like a city at night, with some surreal skyscrapers, enormous cogs and giant clocks. Proyas gives all these scenes a creepy feeling, which is only increased by the fact that there are so few people in the streets and houses. Even everyday things like eating soup and going to work become unreal.<br /><br />But it's also paired with a very suspenseful script, which is equal parts surrealism and gnostic philosophy. All the dialogue is well written (\\"You know something, I don't think the sun even... exists... in this place\\"), and very spare. But Proyas makes all the dialogue weirdly disconnected, as if the characters are never really communicating fully. It adds to the dreamlike feeling.<br /><br />Sewell is well-suited to the role of John Murdoch, moving seamlessly from confusion to skepticism to a pretty wild action scene where he clashes with all the Strangers. Connelly has a good if underused role as his nightclub-singer wife. Kiefer Sutherland is a bit annoying, but he does a good Peter Lorre impersonation with all those nervous gasps.<br /><br />The original DVD was rather bare-bones in its presentation, but apparently Alex Proyas slapped together a long-awaited director's cut. Apparently it restores a substantial amount of cut footage, some updated special effects, remixed sound, and a lighter-colored, techno-creepy cover that emphasizes the sci-fi elements over the noir darkness. Remember the director's cut cover of \\"Donnie Darko\\"? It's a little like that.<br /><br />Like Kafka on acid, \\"Dark City\\" is a unique and compelling sci-fi movie, with outstanding direction and an amazing plot. Definitely a must-see.nd houses.

B0014KD46W|5.0|Well worth the 5-6 year wait and I can't stop playing this album.  Its thematically similar to Steve's last album - the excellent About Time - but even more innovative and enjoyable.      When I first heard About Time, it looks 10+ listenings before I could appreciate all the songs.  Its the same thing on this one.  The music arrangements are complex and rich with standout work by the whole band - Steve, Jose Neto, Karl, Paul and Richard.  The lyrics are very interesting with a spiritual feel.      As in any great album, its hard to single out one song or musician as being the key person - Steve's vocals and hammond organ work, Jose Neto's playful guitar grooves, Karl's incredible percussion, Paul's haunting flute and sax work, and Richard's drum work and Peter's lyrics - a real team effort.       As Steve stated in an inteview, the album came out of music that the band played in their Live sessions and it has that loose and innovative feel to it.  I went to all their concerts in SF in 05 and LA in 06 and the live set has the best jamming I've heard in years.   I hope Steve's successes inspire his contemporaries to experiment with more collaborative, soulful music instead of chasing radio hits or just playing the old hits.     I'm looking forward to Steve's tour with Tom Petty this summer.  You know its a great album when I'm looking forward to hearing the new songs live more than the Traffic classics.  Keep the new music coming, Steve and the band and thanks for a great album!

0385491026|4.0|People always say that children are so innocent, and yet most of us have memories of being tormented by other kids at some point during our childhoods. Sometimes we were even guilty of being the young tormenters ourselves. \\"Cat's Eye\\" explores the complexities of female friendships and the effects these relationships have on people's lives.<br /><br />The novel is narrated from the perspective of Elaine Risley, a middle-aged Canadian painter who returns to her hometown of Toronto for a retrospective of her work. From the very beginning of the novel, it is obvious that Elaine has a slight obsession with her childhood friend, Cordelia, whom she hasn't spoken to in years but expects to encounter at the retrospective. The book soon flashes back to Elaine's youth and describes the experience of moving to Toronto with her parents and brother. Young Elaine eventually befriends a group of three other girls, Cordelia among them. There are times when all four girls get along very well, but at other times Cordelia can be incredibly cruel, especially where Elaine is concerned. These childhood relationships have a profound impact on Elaine's life, particularly the interactions she has with Cordelia, which continue into young adulthood. Elaine eventually realizes how her friendships have affected her whole life and helped shape the woman she has become.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Cat's Eye\\" very much. Margaret Atwood's portrayal of girlhood friendships is incredibly accurate and painfully honest. It's true that all relationships, even those that ended long ago, have a major affect on people for the rest of their lives, and this book does a great job of illustrating that fact. Personally, I think the book drags a bit in places, and it's not my favorite Atwood novel of all time. However, \\"Cat's Eye\\" is very dynamic, powerful, and emotional. It's definitely worth reading.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|Amazing, Rush is still putting out new and exciting music more than 30 years after their debut. Most other bands from the 70's are doing \\"Nostalgia\\" tours, if they are even still together. Snakes & Arrows is somewhat nostalgic, in that it sounds more like the Rush of the late 70's and early 80's than the second half of their career. But that's a good thing, IMO.     Neil's arrangements and percussion work, along Alex's guitars are fantastic, as would be expected. Somewhat surprisingly, age has made Geddy's vocals better, IMO, by softening what sometimes could be a strident edge to his voice.     If you're not a Rush fan, this album won't convert you. But if you already are, this album is like a great visit home.

B00132D808|3.0|There is one reason why I gave Panic!At The Disco 3 stars, but let me tell you first that they are a talented band that give us good tunes and \\"Nine In The Afternoon\\" was my draw to this album.  The album is different from the first album in the sense that it's stylistically different. There is no doubt that songs on Pretty.Odd is cleverly written.  I have listened to this album since the first day of it's release, and after a 5 hour train ride listening to this album last week I didn't feel any different than the first day.  I was trying to see if the album would grow on me and it didn't.  Here is my reason.      The Beatles belong in the 60's.  They got a talented producer that became there George Martin for this project.  The strings and symphony where nicely arranged, but in the end it sounded so much Beatles.  Even the way they recorded.  The hard pan left and right recording, and the effects made it a late 60's beatles memoriam.  I do not mind bands that have Beatles influences, but try to stay away from The Beatles formula.  Bands like Queen, Jellyfish, etc.,have been influenced by the Beatles and you can hear it clearly in their music, but they evolved into something of their own.  Their is no reason for me to go into reviewing the songs of Pretty.Odd , because if you have heard Magical Mystery Tour, Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band etc, you pretty much have heard the albums direction.

He has a rich tapestry of gods, djinns, and quiet Shadow who only wants to get back to his wife, a normal regular life, gets caught up in the beginning of a raging storm.<br />As usual Neil Gaiman creates so many amazing characters. As usual, he has stories hidden inside stories like treasures, like stained glass filled with a variety of patterns.<br />Read this story and enjoy how every character, humans and gods is distinct with their own individual voice.

Not for kids with its R rating, there is plenty of violence and off color jokes.  A 4-star thrill ride with laugh after laugh.  Enjoy!
0670018651|5.0|The amazing thing about some of these reviews is that they fault a book of criticism for being too critical. This is a common complaint of those not used to criticism in any form and there probably isn't a group of manufacturers and consumers less used to criticism than those in the sphere of perfumery. The reason for this is simple: scent has rarely been taken seriously enough to attract intelligent criticism. As many other arts associated with women, it languished barely regarded any more highly than paper dinner napkins or personal hygiene products. But perfumery is about as pure an example of aesthetics as anything. The goal of serious perfume (don't chuckle) is to create beauty, full stop. And like other art forms directed toward this goal, the more intelligently and surprisingly this is done the more beautiful, the more delightful and strange it is to the sensitive nose and sensitive brain at the end of the nose.    To address several recurrent points:    \\"These reviews are so subjective!\\"         Well, yes they are. That's the basis of criticism: the intelligent judgment of a well-developed subjectivity. And there are few more well-developed subjectivities on the topic of perfume than Turin and Sanchez.    \\"Smell is subjective!\\"         In a way, at least (to a degree) the aesthetic reaction to smell is. But that's not disputed. In order for an art form, and the conversation surrounding an art form, to develop intellectually, extreme subjectivity is necessary. Art needs people of taste to delineate its parameters. But more importantly, it needs people of taste who can communicate their ideas in beautiful, sharp and surprising ways. That's the role of a great critic. Of course you might not agree with the taste of the critic at all times. But that's not the goal of criticism. Turin and Sanchez might, now and then, stray from my taste. But they do it entertainingly and intelligently.    \\"This book is so negative and nasty!\\"          Of course there is negativity in a book of criticism! The negativity (hilariously) displayed in \\"Perfumes: The Guide\\" is the reaction of passionate lovers of perfumery towards the cynical trash often foisted on the underdeveloped tastes of the public. If there seems to be a surfeit of negativity it is only because there is a surfeit of cynical, slapdash stink water crowding the shelves of Sephora. Any art lover will lash out at vulgarity which cheapens and debases the art that they deeply love.    \\"Turin and Sanchez seem to consistently denigrate certain brands and promote others\\"          Yes, as anyone who loves the work of an artist tends to follow and appreciate their work over their careers. To cite several perfume houses frequently lauded by Turin and Sanchez in the book: Guerlain, Chanel, and Parfums De Nicolai. But each of these brands also receive negative reviews for several of their products. Guerlain's dreadful \\"Champs-Élysées\\", for instance, receives one of the more savage reviews in the book. The author's partiality to certain makers and perfumers only extends to their products that deserve it. And of course, consistently mediocre or terrible brands receive consistently negative reviews because, after all, they consistently deserve it.    To summarize: this book is a book of perfume criticism, therefore it is full of criticism. It is written by authors who are extraordinarily knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. You might not always agree with their aesthetic perspective, but it's still a crackling, invigorating tour-de-force of short-form criticism about a subject that has never received and doesn't always deserve such intelligent consideration. The book doesn't contain meaningless lists of \\"notes\\" (pink jasmine, white musk, Tilapian elderflowers, cracked dungberries) which of course is a positive in my opinion. Almost no contemporary perfume consumers know what fields of Grasse jasmine or Jabuticaba fruit smell like anyway, so what help are such lists? Turin and Sanchez have an amazing ability to convey the totality of the composition without resorting to listing fantasy ingredients; if you want that sort of nonsense, read the press release for the perfume or consult Jan Moran. You might find that Turin and Sanchez hate a perfume that you like (they hate a couple that I like). Don't get upset. They don't hate you, dear. Enjoy the wonderful give-and-take of opinion that is the essence of intelligent and spirited dialogue. Remember that \\"Perfumes: The Guide is no nonsense. If you can't handle the unvarnished opinions of a pair of talented and sharp writers without getting the vapors, don't buy the book. Step away from your computer, make yourself a cup of chamomile tea and settle in to bed with that cat book.    In my (naturally) subjective opinion, the book is one of a kind and indispensable.
0440236738|5.0|Thriller writer extraordinaire Harlan Coben's Gone for Good features the troubles a family endures when one of the members, Ken, is accused of a brutal rape murder of his brother's ex-girlfriend.  Family dynamics are intertwined with a great mystery as only Coben can write.  Chock full of all of the elements that make for a great mystery and thriller - diabolical bad guys, a labyrinth of a story, romance, hate, and surprises - this is a must read.<br /><br />Ken's brother Will finds himself embroiled in a \\"Hitchcockian\\" plot that soon has the mob, FBI, runaways, violent crimes, and emotion coursing through each page.  This is a top notch thrill ride that is worth a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!  I sure did.
B000O178BY|2.0|Having all of his previous studio releases, and having seen him live in concert twice, this one feels like the leftover stuff that didn't make it on With Teeth, its just not worthy of his previous work. It not intriguing or moving, its just annoying.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|I bought 3 music blu-rays, I thought this one was the best of the three.   It feels as if you are at the concert itself.  Highly recommended!

B00127RAJY|5.0|Love the workout! I've done it two days in a row and can't walk down the stairs. It's so quick for so much result.   My only beef is that she only give you one workout per level, so it's not so easy to do two days in a row.  With her other workouts, she alternates front and back so your tired muscles have time to rest, but with this one you're supposed to do the same thing day after day until you're ready to move up a level.  I'd recommend using this one with her 5-DVD set for days when you can't spare more than 20 minutes and still want a killer shred.

0575077174|1.0|I was amazed when I opened this book by Reynolds, usually one of my favourite authors. It is so different from anything else that I know of written by him that I at first thought someone had smuggled their fairy story into publication under his name.It is full of 'millions of years this' and 'hundreds of millennia that', the absurd disappearance of the Andromeda galaxy, much more of a fantasy with cutsey characters, including anachronisms that jarred me and vague hand waving descriptions of vast super collossal phenomena that are set so far in the future that meaning is lost. I cannot stand this sort of self-indulgent self-conscious attempt at inducing in the reader a sense of wonder; it is impossible to understate my disappointment after having looked forward to this book in the way I have always looked forward to his works and found that he had ceased to be a weaver of tough and hard edged complex tales and instead had become a knitter of gossamer whimsy.  The book resembles a sub-Olaf Stapledon 1930s production, owing something to John C. Wright's 'Golden Age' but without the enormous depths of erudition of that writer. I have been reading SF for many decades (if not a million years yet), since before Alastair Reynolds was born; I have never liked the over-ambitious 'cosmic' books of the 30s, 40s and 50s, which always seemed to me to be manufactured from straw and spit. Writers like Arthur C. Clarke, books like 'Mission of Gravity' and the stories manipulated by the strong editorial hand of John W. Campbell in 'Analog' tuned my sensibilities as I was growing up, nevertheless, as member number 5 of the UK Tolkien Society I obviously have no problem with fantasy either, when it is well done. 'House of Suns' could be given the old label 'science fantasy', as devised by John Carnell for the eponymous magazine, which had a brief life span in the 1950s and '60s in the UK. As a principle it seems to me that, as Arthur C. Clarke said (more or less) any technology sufficiently advanced appears to be magic, so when a writer takes their story so far into the future and tries to describe the science of that time it is impossible to convince the reader that what they are reading is not magic and fairy story-there is no willing suspension of disbelief. We cannot know what life would be like millions of years hence and the only way authors have got round this fairly obvious problem is by claiming that we will, to some extent and perhaps patchily, regress to more understandable technologies and ways of living (and ways of waging war, as in the 'Warhammer 40,000' universe); the earliest example of this can be found in H. G. Wells 'Time Machine', that describes the Eloi and the Morlocks in the very distant future.  My initial anger at having been so betrayed in my expectations of this author has faded; I simply feel sad that some have said this is a phase-shift to a higher level of SF for him, when it is essentially a turn off (in more ways than one for me) into a literary cul-de-sac full of the bones of writers who have made a similar bad decision and lost their audience.
0743270754|5.0|There is no other word for it, this book is brilliant.  Coming into it, I thought I knew a fair amount about Lincoln and workings of the war.  However, the way the author depicts Lincoln and his cabinet is incredible.  There is such depth, honesty, and intricacy to it.  Although there is not a lot of background info on the war itself, that, for the most part, is not missed.  The book focuses on Lincoln and his cabinet, and how he, in his own political genius, pulled together varying factions of the new Republian party to solve the crises facing the country.  It's a fascinating insight into one of the great political and moral minds of history.  It is not to be missed.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|The only place this movie belongs is in the incinerator!!  There was absolutely no story here...some numbskull got roped into videotaping the party they were having and WOW aliens dropped out of the sky and everyone is running around like idiots!  No real story line at all.  Had the creators thought enough to put `real' characters to the movie and create a real sci-fi story it might have been salvageable!!  I'm a real Sci-Fi lover but this doesn't even come close to real science fiction it runs more in line with something that popped off the TV back in the 1940's!  Stupid with no story line at all!!  Waste of money and time!  I would have given it a NO STAR RATING if I could have!
B000N6TX22|5.0|When walking out of the movie theater, I was confused and hated this movie. By the time I got to my car, I had plenty of time for the movie to soak in and I actually liked it.  By the time I got home, I loved this movie. Give it a chance and keep your mind open and you'll like this movie as much as I do.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|After over a decade, this movie is still rated as one of my favorites.  Though I know the outcome, and could probably recite half the script, word for word, I still cry like a baby.      If you are a fan of the movie, but not a die-hard, then the 10th Anniversary, 2 disc Edition will probably be a good investment.  For a person like me, however, obsessed with treats such as the deleted scenes, this is a great addition to your DVD collection.  There is over 45 minutes of deleted scenes on the 3rd disc.  On the 2nd disc is an alternate ending, which is about 7 minutes in length, if I remember correctly.  So, combined, deleted scenes run about 54 minutes . . .    While I own Titanic on VHS, the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD, and now the Collectors Edition, if a new set were to be released with the movie in it's full original epic glory of 5+ hours, I would probably run out and be one of the first to own it.  Until then, though, this is a phenomenal set to own.
0307237702|5.0|I enjoyed reading this, because it taught me much about the inner workings of Washington and it was a declaration to hope for a new United States.  We have to believe that this man can win the Presidential race. He has a well-rounded view of different cultures and is extremely intelligent, which would be an excellent start in finally uniting the United States of America.  That's my opinion and it was strengthened by reading this book.
0385751532|5.0|Books about the Holocaust are never easy to read. Some are downright terrifying and some make the reader nauseous. This book however approaches this period in history from a new and interesting angle and tells a tale of what might have happened, and in doing so opens up these stories to a whole new generation of readers. The book was originally marketed as a children's book, and then remarketed as adult fiction because of the content. The author claims it is just a book, and soon it will be a major motion picture due out in the fall of 2008.<br /><br />This is the story of two boys who lose everything they hold dear, yet the reality of their loss is completely different. Bruno's life is changed when his father is given a new job and they move from their five-story home in Berlin to a new home in the country that is only three stories tall. He has lost his 3 best friends in life, and his home with the banister and the attic window that looks out over all of Berlin. His new bedroom window looks over small huts in a fenced-in area where everyone wears striped pajamas. One day while being rebellious and doing what he should never do, he walks along the fence and meets a boy with whom he shares a birthday. Shmuel and Bruno meet most days and sit on the opposite sides of the fence and talk. As their friendship grows Bruno's youthful innocence is challenged.<br /><br />The novel is told in the third person narrative, but told from a nine-year- old's perspective. Though the reader knows that the story takes place at Auschwitz, Bruno cannot pronounce it, and misunderstood the name from the beginning. Yet in not naming the place the author leaves the story as a much broader tale.<br /><br />This book is extremely well-written; it takes the reader to a place and time we should never forget, and it reminds us of the human element in all stories. John Boyne has written a book that could become required reading for all school children, and maybe all adults should read it also, lest we forget. So pick it up and walk with Bruno and Shmuel as they develop a growing friendship just sitting and talking through a barbed- wire-topped chain link fence.<br /><br />(First Published in Imprint 2008-05-02.)up and walk with Bruno and Shmuel as they develop a growing friendship just sitting and talking through a barbed- wire-topped chain link fence.

B000ZN802W|4.0|Into the Wild sounds the death knell of the counter culture lorded by the baby boomers. Alaska looks like a gorgeous part of the world. The film is so outrageously poetic the chance meetings seemed contrived, Christopher would have been 4 years younger than me, I was often saddened by the film, there were moments of recognition that made want to cry but I didn't because I'm an adult. The dude should have read the pack before he scoffed down the potato roots how could one of Americas' brightest be so stupid? It's the kind of film to give your disgruntled teenager as a peace offering after you've said no to the third piercing. One question, How many people did the little dude tell, that he was going off to Alaska?

B000AM1TGC|3.0|If you're a fan of early Genesis, then by all means, pick this up. It's good prog-rock, well-played and with some really nice parts. But there's no way you can compare this to something like \\"Nursery Crime\\" or \\"Foxtrot\\". It's not in that league. But it's also far from  a failure.
B00006L83N|5.0|For their next ambitious project the band put forth a musical version of Homer's classic \\"The Odyssey\\".  Projects like this can come across as pretentious and cornball, but Symphony X manages to pull off a very nice release here.  The album is actually divided in two parts with the first half 7 individual songs and the second half the epic \\"Odyssey\\" saga that clocks in at almost 25 minutes.  The first half of the album is a definite move back into a heavier direction from the band's last album \\"V\\".  The keyboards are more buried in the mix and the guitars generally more riff oriented.  Although I love \\"V\\" I also enjoy the more metal oriented Symphony X as well.  The epic at the end reminds me a lot of \\"Twilight In Olympus\\" with it's telling of the ancient Greek tale.  The music is a bit more progressive oriented here and with a nice mix of styles that the band flourishes on.  Symphony X is a band that deserves more recognition than it gets, they should be playing stadiums instead of clubs.
1401201911|5.0|It was almost disheartening to see how other heroes developed because of Superman's altered upbringing.  But man this storyline rocked.  Easy, quick read with awesome art makes this storyline one of the best I've read in a while.  They took Superman's normal mentality and put it into a \\"What If...\\" scenario where Superman's ship landed in Ukraine instead of the heartland of America.  Nearly everything from the original Superman storyline was brilliantly ported over to this scenario.  All I can say is that this is definitely worth the money.
B000K6QIQO|5.0|This a very good album, very tight and complete, even that the period where the songs came from is quite long, beginning from Hard Day's Night album (I should have known better) and finishing with 1970 (The Ballad of John and Yoko)... it's a must have for a Beatles fan and for collectors, otehrwise, if this variant is too expensive for you, get Past Masters II, there are even more tracks there, for instance interesting versions of Acros the Universe and Let it Be...
B0011FXLCC|1.0|Sounds like Enya and Joni Mitchell -- post-sex change, of course -- popped out a baby who as a young child dreamed of growing up to become some cheap casio Madonna ripoff. A plastic statuette breeding styrofoam. This stutter, this putrid remainder of a burp hanging in the air, makes Eisley come across like Black Sabbath by comparison.<br /><br />\\"A&E\\" belongs on the Hallmark Channel during a particularly introspective moment on \\"Seventh Heaven\\" or \\"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.\\" Don't even get me started on the video for that sonic bit of parsley-on-the-plate: mocking nature via some chick on LSD belittling tree leaves, turning them into servile apes that have nothing better to do than dance around and around her like she's some woods goddess, some Ursula K. Le Guin-mindmelded, ointment-coated masseuse from a small fishing town. It's not important where. And her stupid la-z-boy husband plucking his junior Roebuck and drinking hot water, snorting coke and playing computer chess.<br /><br />I know everybody's trying to jump onto the '70s bandwagon again cuz it's in season (The National, Ester Drang, Midlake, Grandaddy, Band of Horses), but why choose to emulate Captain and Tennille? I think I'm getting cancer on an area of my body to which I do not know the name. My cat likes jumping on boxes and scratching my face up when I sleep.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|First off, I'm NOT Jeff, I'm his daughter. In 2005 is when I heard Panic! At The Disco's hit \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\". I loved the song immediately. In 2007, I went online and found the song again. That's when I started to get obsessed with them. I bought the album and loved it. I kept listening to it over and over again. The songs are amazing and unlike anything I've heard before. There's a keyboard here and there and also violin. Now let me get to the songs.    1. Introduction: 10/10- It's not a song, but it introduces the songs.  2. The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage: 10/10- I LOVE this song! In the song, it got to a part where it had a techno sound in it. That really got my attention.  3. London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines: 10/10- I love the beat in this song. It's very catchy.  4. Nails For Breakfast Tacks For Snacks: 15/10- This has to be my third favorite song. It tells a story and I think that it's pretty neat. It also might be a little slower than the others.  5. Camisado: 10/10- I really loved how the beginning went. It started slow then it went right to fast.   6. Time To Dance: 20/10- Probably my second favorite song. It has a very interesting beat to it. This song makes me want to get up and dance!  7. Lying Is The Most Fun A Girl Can Have Without Taking Off Her Clothes: 10/10- This is a pretty slow song in the beginning, but when it gets to the second verse, it's fast in the beginning and then it gets slow again. I really like the song and the lyrics as well.  8. Intermission: 10/10- This is interesting on how they did the piano in this. It really caught my attention. This gives you a break on the music for a while. It felt like I was at a concert.  9. But It's Better If You Do: 10/10- This one also tells a story. I love how Brendon's (lead singer) telling the story from his point of view, that gives creativity to this song.  10. I Write Sins Not Tragedies: 10/10- I NEVER get tired of this song! Even thought that it played on the radio like dozen of times, it's still catchy.  11. I Constantly Thank God For Esteban: 12/10- The beat is interesting in this one. It starts somewhat slow, but not too slow in the beginning then it gets faster when it gets into the song.   12. There's A Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet: 15/10- This one was interesting. I liked how Brendon is like talking to an audience in the song.  13. Build God Then We'll Talk: 100000000/10- My all time favorite on the album. It has a good beat and it has somewhat of a story in it as well.     All and all it's an AWESOME album! I'm be a P!ATD fan and always will be.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Terrifically entertaining, fast action, imaginative and, in some ways, perversely funny.  Dexter has his own system of justice and, quite frankly, at times, it's hard to disagree with his logic, that being ridding of world of \\"scum\\".  Dexter seems to have a look at his own issues and has the ability to separate himself from his extracurricular activities.     He, like so many serial killers, carries on what appears to be an otherwise normal life for the most part.  He shows care and nurturing towards his girlfriend and her children.  They can count on him for protection and know nothing about what he does in his \\"spare\\" time.    The acting is above reproach.  Michael C. Hall has an excellent grasp on what makes this character tick and can even, in some ways, bring the viewer to a place of sympatico.  At the very least, one can get a greater understanding of the psychotic mind, especially after viewing the relationship between Dexter and his father.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Long before his Vice Presidency, Al Gore was bringing the 'news' about global warming to colleges and other large venues around the US, and this dvd is essentially a class on global warming. I was not too eager to sit through a gloom and doom film, but this dvd was much easier to watch than I thought it would be. It presents simple facts and diagrams that show how we have come to our current world state, and where we are surely going at this rate. The answers may not be simple or easy, but they are certainly possible, and I would recommend this dvd to anyone at any age.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|This series, without a doubt is one of the best science fiction stories ever produced. While it is true the sales for this movie series is less than the block buster Star Wars, it is nonetheless a story with a plot that is captivating.  While the acting is not the greatest, it is the story that brings you back to watch it multiple times.
B000HWZ5W4|4.0|Originally released in 1983, this is the re-issued version from Rhino Records. There are 4 bonus tracks, and the booklet contains a small forward about Robert Plant, and the album.    I've always enjoyed an artist who will evolve, and this is what you see here. Robert Plant continued his solo career distinguishing himself from Led Zeppelin. I don't enjoy this disc quite as much as his first solo release 'Pictures At Eleven', but that's not to say that it is not an enjoyable disc.     Plant remains one of the most identifiable voices in rock history, and that is true here as well. The tracks do not hit as hard, or as raw as Zeppelin tracks, sounding a bit more studio polished, but still hold up nicely. Robbie Blunt's guitar is haunting and beautiful, especially on the hit track 'Big Log', and Phil Collins odd syncopated patterns on drums really make for a unique sound, blending hard rock with blues, and perhaps a dash of 80s synth pop.    Fave cuts for me; Other Arms, In The Mood, and Big Log. There first two bonus cuts are live versions of studio songs on the album, which don't do much for me,, but the third is a keeper,, a live version of Bob Marley's Lively Up Yourself (proving Robert Plant can be FUN!) and the fourth (Turnaround) is nice to hear because it's a studio song that was cut from the original album and really fits in.     Worthwhile!
B00139XZF4|1.0|This one was rife with problems. I went in wanting this to be good, but there was just nothing to make it a compelling flick. The characters are boring and one-dimensional, either evil because \\"that's how things are\\" or good because \\"we aren't going to take this anymore!\\" The film was shot with no regard to pacing at all. There are gratuitous shots of scenery just so the filmmakers could show off how wonderful their environments were. The whole thing even wraps up with a plot synopsis of the upcoming films, which runs something like:  \\"Can we go home now?\\"  \\"No.\\"  \\"Why not?\\"  \\"We have to find a way to milk this franchise for all its worth.  There are many people out there who are craving a secular, humanistic fantasy story, and we'll give it to them.\\"  \\"Oh. Okay. How?\\"  *Explanation of inevitable plot points*  \\"Oh.  Okay.\\"  Credits.  Underwhelming, at best.
0767827902|3.0|The Last Picture Show is considered to be a black and white classic but this film just left me depressed. Cloris Leachman is the best thing in this downer, her performance is so heartbreaking (she won an Oscar for best supporting actress). Cybill Shepherd lives up to her own stereotype, pretty blonde who sleeps with everyone in town, her character is so unlikeable. I just thought this movie was just ok, decide for yourself.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Ok, so I remember watching one episode on TV of Firefly.  I remember liking it, but as things go, I lost track of it.    Well, I tacked on a used Serenity DVD to one of my orders, just as a 'take a chance' type choice.  And I finally got around to watching it recently.    Why did I wait so long!!  This is a 2 hour thrill ride that you will not notice is 2 hours in the least!!!  The chemistry between the actors is always noticable, and the humor shared is subtle, but still hits you, and does not lay flat at all!  The contrast between the villian and the anti-hero was also welcome, even if it was a bit western in feel.    The story is a little conventional 'chase the truth' type movie.  Where the clues lead to somewhere they know is suicide to venture, but they do it anyway (don't want to give anything else away).  Most of it ties in well though, and only feels contrived at a couple points in the movie.  The dialogue is written oddly, again playing the to the western themes, but you get used to it within the first 30 minutes.    The one complaint I have are the very darkly lit shots on the Firefly itself.  I figure this was intentional as there are starkly contrasting shots in other scenes for different 'feels' in the movie.  And a couple of shots were dark to leave you with that 'what just happened!?' feel... to good effect.  However, there were some shots on the Firefly that were just dialogue, and were dark for no good reason.  This group of actors seemed to work well together, so it was a shame to not clearly see all their nuances when interacting.    Once you get past that, Serenity is a great movie, well worthy of multiple viewings.  I hope to put it back in the player and watch it with the commentary on... something I rarely do with a DVD.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a really tough, intense workout-but Jillian really knows how to motivate!  The first time I did it I thought I would never make it to the end, but she just keeps on pushing and helped me find strength I never knew I had.  I've been doing this for about a month now, still on level 1, but I am definately getting better at all the really tough exercises that I had so much trouble with in the beginning.  I feel like superwoman when I'm done!  It's a great feeling to make it through a really tough workout-it's very empowering!  I think Jillian is awesome-she is really tough, but she knows how to really motivate you and push you to your full potential-and she really gets results!!
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Awesome movie, lots of creepy monsters of all sizes and shapes, makes for good heart pounding action. But more important, it is a psychological movie,  a study of what happens when the elements that hold society together cease to function; that is when the real monsters come out, and those monsters are us.
B000ZN802W|4.0|This is an incredibly detailed account of a young man's journey of self-reflection away from the dismantling extravagance of society. Sean Penn did a marvelous job directing and if I had one quarrel with any of his decisions, it would be the closing sequence. The camera \\"spins\\" away from McCandless which is a bit irritating and I felt that it was amateurish and kitschy at best. Otherwise a brilliant film that we could all learn a lot from. Beautifully captured landscapes and weather, encounters with wildlife and the brilliance of the supporting actors really enhanced the overall viewing experience for me. There isn't a finer video rendition of a book that I know of. Cheers to Sean Penn and the rest of the cast for really making this book sing as a film.<br /><br />/m
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Cloverfield comes off a pretty decent run in theaters and into our homes on  DVD. I enjoyed this movie in the theater and felt that it did a pretty good job in creating a true-to-life enactment of New York City being attacked by a giant monster of unknown origin and what it would be like to experience something like that first hand. Even on DVD, the urgency of the film's storytelling style manages to come through and even though I had already watched the film prior and it was lacking the jarring effect of seeing it on a huge screen, it still managed to strike a chord of uneasiness with me, helped to no end by several shots which serve to remind the viewer of the tragic events of 9/11. Many people had a problem with the \\"shakycam\\" style of the film which bears more than a striking resemblance to the mayhem that was \\"The Blair Witch Project\\". The shakycam in this flick didn't really bug me as much as it did some other folks but to some it may be intolerable. You may want to keep this detail in mind if you suffer from motion sickness in any way. Also of annoyance to some was the cast of twenty-something hipsters who get little to no background development in the film and exist solely to get it in any number of different ways. I sort of agree with the consensus on this but hey, I didn't come to watch a Generation X (or whatever generation this is) angst fest, I came to see New York get destroyed by a giant monster, and that I definitely got. All in all, I think the film is at least worth a watch, especially if you like the giant monster movies of old.<br /><br />The film is presented very well with great picture and great sound. When the military attacks the creature early on, you'll feel like you're in the middle of a live firefight and it's one of the films best moments. It's kind of funny to think that you'd get a full Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix off of something that is basically supposed to be shot with a home video camera but hey, I won't say anything if you don't.<br /><br />Watching the bonus features on the disc, I've walked away from it with even more respect for the film. There are docs on the making of the film and some behind the scenes stuff on the special effects which was mind blowing. I was surprised to learn that most of the film was shot in L.A. and that most of the New York scenes were done with bluescreen. Watching the film, the effects blend in seamlessly and the featurette shows just how much painstaking detail went into these scenes. I'd definitely recommend this as must-see viewing to fans of the film. The commentary is worth a listen and contains some interesting insight into the films genesis and production.<br /><br />In the end, it comes down to this: I wouldn't recommend this disc to the many people who could not stand this film. There's nothing here that will make anyone who hated it the first time around enjoy it this time. I liked it and have no problem recommending it to the people who did though.<br /><br />Just one thing: that fantastic teaser trailer that played before Transformers, the one that worked up all that buzz for the film? Nowhere on this disc, unless it's an easter egg that I missed. Kinda strange not to include it, if you ask me.Watching the bonus features on the disc, I've walked away from it with even more respect for the film.

B000002P74|5.0|Well, not really, but it's such a nice line from the song \\"Swamp Music\\":  \\"...When the hound dogs start barkin' / sound like ol' Son House singin' the blues!\\"    I lean towards \\"Pronounced\\" being Lynyrd Skynyrd's best album, but this one is certainly not far behind. It may require a bit more time in order for the listener to truly appreciate it, but \\"Second Helping\\" is well worth it.  Yes, \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" is here, and needs no introduction, I suspect, but this is not one of those album where one mega-hit completely dwarfs everything else. Three more tough riff-rockers, \\"Workin' For MCA\\", \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\", and \\"The Needle and the Spoon\\", are almost as memorable, and lesser-known songs like the New Orleans-R&B of \\"Swamp Music\\" and the melodic folk-blues pastiche \\"The Ballad of Curtis Loew\\" deserve much praise as well.    Skynyrd's popular, up-tempo cover of J.J. Cale's rollicking \\"Call Me The Breeze\\" is here as well, as is the seven-minute slow rock number \\"I Need You\\". The latter is the least memorable song on the album, which means it's only pretty good.    This remastered edition adds three bonus tracks, the single version of \\"Don't Ask Me No Questions\\", which is pretty much like the album version, and two nice demos, the low-key ballad \\"Was I Right or Wrong\\", and the swaggering \\"Take Your Time\\".  They're both fine songs, especially the latter, which has something of an \\"Elvis sings swamp blues\\" quality to it. But you should get it for the original eight tracks, really, because this is such a unusually strong collection of songs. Great, great music, and some really fine songwriting as well. The band is tight but very much on fire, and the production by Al Kooper is excellent.  4 3/4 stars - highly recommended!
B000OCXMAE|2.0|Linkin Park made some mistakes with this album.     I'm a stong believer in bands evolving and changing over time, but going from a punk/rock/rap band to a ballad band in one CD is too much to put on your fans.     Besides their drastic change in tone, they also introduced vulgar language (which has never stopped me from buying a CD before, but I always enjoyed that I could pop their CD in without hearing the profanity), and, *gasp* politics. Seriously. Bands like LP should be forced to put warning labels on their CDs if they plan on spouting mindless rederick and shallow political views. This is ENTERTAINMENT not REAL LIFE.    I was SO disapointed when I finished this one. I've even been hoping it will grow on me, putting it in the CD player once or twice a month. Nope. I won't even wear the T-Shirt I got with my $30 pre-order.     I'll be reading some reviews before blindly buying their next album. The only reason I gave it two stars is Bleed it Out. It spoke of early Likin Park, even though they did use profanity.    Overall a poor effort. Two-thumbs down.

B0000067L2|5.0|Essential...as all Cream (or 'The Cream' as originally called in the UK)is essential.  There is not one Cream album better than any other.  They are ALL essential.  This is hard, blues based, psychedelic, heavy, rock music at its ever loving best.  Cream was and is in a class by themselves, as is Led Zeppelin, early Fleetwood Mac, and The Yardbirds.  All white-boy blues at the supreme level.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti Smith-Horses *****<br /><br />Horses is a lot of things. It is one of the first and best punk albums of all time, it is Smiths finest record, one of the best albums of all time, one of the most important albums of all time, it's legendary, brilliant, poetic, socially conscious, angry, gentle...perfect.<br /><br />From the feminist album cover featuring Patti in her Keith Richards outfit, the one she wore all the damn time back in the day, to the last notes of the mournful 'Elegie' Horses is one of the most eclectic and genius pieces of music ever. The cover of Them's 'Gloria' with the infamous opening line \\"Jesus died for somebody's sins/But not mine\\" is maybe better than the original if you can believe it. The ska of 'Redondo Beach' (which by the way she was the only Yankee to attempt ska and reggae other then the Brits) is refreshing. 'Birdland' is haunting while 'Free Money' is hopeful. 'Kimberly' and 'Break It Up' are equally melloncholly. 'Land' is maybe the greatest song in the history of punk, featuring a cover of 'Land Of A Thousand Dances' making it easily the most original song of all time to feature a cover. 'Elegie' is a suicide song the closes the album scarily. On some versions of the newly remastered album there is a bonus cover of The Who's 'My Generation' which is killer to say the least.<br /><br />Whether it is the poetic beauty of the lyrics or the raw power of the music, Horses is an album worthy of every music collection, and of a listen from everyone. It is powerful and moving, more so than maybe any other album I have ever heard. Highly, highly, highly, recommended!
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|What a fun movie!  I think that I could watch it back to back without it getting stale.  The acting is excellent.  It has to be; unless you are a serious movie buff you won't recognize anyone.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|In the wake of Charlton Heston's death, I decided to have a marathon viewing of his films. I rewatched many of my favorites and sought out some of those I had never seen.    \\"El Cid\\" was one I had not watched before, probably because it only recently became available on DVD. As he often did, Heston plays a real-life character, an 11th-century Spanish hero who sought to unite his country. It is one of those epic historical films Heston specialized in, and it does a good job of conveying that time and place. Although set 1,000 years ago, the themes of the story still resonate today.    One of the things I like about these films is that they were made pre-CGI, so they were generally shot on location and much of the spectacle was actually staged for the cameras (No computer-generated armies here).    The Cid was a complex character and, unlike some of his other roles, Heston plays him in an understated way. The Cid was valiant and loyal, a selfless warrior loved by the people. He preached tolerance and tried to show that all Muslims were not evil. But he was humble and deferential to a fault, putting his sense of duty to country and king before everything, even his family.    There are some grand action scenes: a spectacular jousting duel and several large scale battles. The musical score is sweeping and beautiful. Yes, there is some melodramatic acting in places, but overall the performances are good.    The central love story did not work for me, however. The Cid's relationship with Chemene, played by Sophia Loren, is up and down throughout the film: first she loves him, then she hates him, then she loves him. They do not spend enough time together to make a convincing case that this was a great love affair.    If you like behind-the-scenes features, there are several interesting documentaries on the second disc: one deals with the making of the film, then there are bios of the producer, the director, the composer, and an odd little piece on some guy who works in filmpreservation.    All in all I would recommend \\"El Cid\\" to anyone who likes Charlton Heston and big historical films. As they say, they don't make `em like this anymore.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|This is a great concert with wonderful tracks and impeccable sound.  It is as close to perfect as it can get save one thing.    Matt Bellamy is a pacer.  He literally paces back and forth when he's not in front of the mic.  Because of this.. a visual style is being used to mask this.... It has been taken to the extreme.  The editor seemed to have Attention Deficit Disorder and is unable to focus for more than a few seconds at a time.. and then jump to another camera.  It really seems spastic.. but it doesn't make it unwatchable and sometimes really suits the  tension of the music.    Muse is considered one of the best live bands touring today and Bellamy is considered one of the to 20 guitarist of all time (according to some english list.  Anyhow.. this is a concert DVD that does the justice.  The live sound will astound you.    If you are unfamiliar with Muse.. then this is a good introduction to their music and is a very inexpensive way to get a feel for their sound and progression as artists.    Give it a shot.      I rate this 5 stars because it comes with the cd as well and the price is a complete steal for a live dvd cd set.
B0014KD46W|4.0|Fresh off of a reunion tour with Blind Faith Steve Winwood emmerges with this album.While I still lean towards [[ASIN:B000001FUV Steve Winwood]],[[ASIN:B000000ISL Arc of a Diver]] and [[ASIN:B000001FT0 Talking Back to the Night]] as my favorite Winwood solo albums (all three showcase his talents as a computer,vocalist and multi instrumentalist best) this album has a different kind of charm. The music here generally bridges the cap between Winwood's music with Blind Faith and Traffic with his patented genre bending blend of pop,rock,soul,funk,blues and jazz. He starts off the album in a rather quiet mood with \\"I'm Not Drowning\\" and \\"Fly\\",the later of which features a beautiful flute solo. On \\"Raging Sea\\" Winwood gets down into a funky mood which extends into the blues on the meandering \\"Dirty City\\" with Eric Clapton,adding his trademark rocking blues licks to the proceeding. The next four songs \\"We're All Looking\\",\\"Hungry Man\\",\\"Secrets\\" and \\"At Times We Do Forget\\" all showcase the percussive/rhythm-based sound of Traffic but again Winwoods quiet mood continues.On \\"Other Shore\\" Steve presents a very good pop song using a similar sound. There's only one question about all this-why other then some good songs would anyone beside Winwood fans want this? Steve Winwood has been around for four decades and while his music has never really wavered in quality his enthusiasm has on occasion,especially on his spotty 90's recordings. So this album isn't as much a comeback as an extension on a theme. It also has the feeling of an album that,while by no means a future classic will grow on the listener and surely become a fan favorite to some people.And being a Winwood fan I hope I am one of them.
0061120081|5.0|There is a reason that this book is extremely popular, and now that I've finally had a chance to read it, I know why: I consider it to be one of the most well-written books I ever stumbled upon.<br />Lee's writing is so precise and sharp that it makes me wonder exactly how long it took her to come up with the first idea of the story, and then finally to have turned in the final draft for publishing.  A story with characters like this could take years to write.<br />For those who have never had the privilege of reading this masterpiece, do not overestimate this book by its mass popularity; unlike the countless books out there that are popular, no matter how bad they really are, Lee's book continues to thrive in both classrooms and bookstores alike because of the universal lessons it has to teach.<br />It can be enjoyed by both the young and the old, but I suggest that you wait till you're older to read it, as the mind may not be able to fully appreciate it until it is well seasoned.
B00005JO20|5.0|I enjoyed the original King Kong but this remake with Naomi Watts, Adrian Brody and Jack Black is one of the best. I have many remakes of other films that I've put on the shelf because they can't top the originals.  This version of King Kong has made its way through many a household since I have loaned it out to any and all who care to view it and possibly buy it for their own collection.
0937381888|5.0|Excellent book. It has info on everything you need to know about homebrewing. I keep it by my bedside.
1932100660|4.0|This book summarizes the incredible large-scale study of diet and health that draws some potentially uncomfortable conclusions about the typical American diet. As a motivation to seriously consider making the switch to a vegan diet, the book is powerful. I only gave it four stars because I felt it could have presented more of the study's data and details and spent less time recounting the efforts of the food and drug industry to promote different ideas.  The events covered in the fourth section began to come across as a bit of a paranoid rant (though I don't doubt at all that it is true).
B000002GVO|5.0|I was 21 when this came out but was not a big Eagles fan since I was a musical snob and they were a comercial success.  When the title track hit the airwaves, I heard a plagerized version of \\"We Used to Know\\" by Jethro Tull. It has an almost identical chord progression. But then again, I was a musical snob.  Now, in my aged wisdom, I have dropped all the snobbery and have given this \\"album\\" a second listen.  While it's not in my top 10, it's up there on my list of great albums.  I actually always liked \\"The last resort\\" for it's message and sonic appeal.  I was also a Joe Walsh fan from his James Gang and early solo work (FM radio only!) but never liked his squeaky voice.  His brilliat guitar work made up for it.  So Walsh on guitar with the other Eagles professionals made for flawless rockin riffs.  I also have changed my opinion of \\"Victim of love\\". In my snobby days, I scoffed at it's simplicity, being more attracted to complex musical forms, but now.... it has become one of my favorite songs BECAUSE of it's simplicity!  (The excellent guitar work helps, too!)  Anyway, this old non-fan is now a new fan.  I may even go out and get tickets to see the old geezers before they expire!

B0001MDP3G|5.0|This film is excellent.  I was very impressed with the story line and greatly appreciated the characterizations by Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger.  If you are interested in the Civil War era, this is an appropriate film and will hold your interest.

B0004Z33G4|5.0|Really I think the video hound underrates this. I saw the 4th film and was definitely disappointed but I just think that for an adventure film Stallone is definitely too old. However these 3 are definitely phenomenal  and a must have for any avid action movie person. I agree with video hound that the second and third do not have the most desperate points although I still think they have character. I am amazed that they are able to also include blood but not to the point that you feel totally sick (as found in movies such as the shining or other horror titles). I think it gives you a real life feeling and you can really get into it. My favorite parts were the beginning of Number 1 when Rambo is killing with just his knife, the break he makes into the Korean camp in the second, and the great war vs. the Russians at the last camp battle. Like I said above it will keep you on the edge of your seat and if you let it will let you relive the life of Rambo.
B0012E6R3W|3.0|Listening to this is like hearing one of the first 4 albums, updated w/ todays production (not like the piece of crap First strike Still Deadly remakes, J. tempesta you disapoint me).  The overall feeling I get when listening to this, is Ive heard these songs before.  Riffs and vocal lines seem plucked out of yesteryear, and while its not surprising as the \\"classic\\" line up is back together for the first time in 16 yrs, I was hoping for a further progression from the old guard.  Low, to me, is the album updating the old sound and was refreshing.  Demonic takes a left turn into \\"Murky Waters\\" w/ its slow, grooving, not-quite-death-metal vibe.  That one took me a while to appreciate.  The Gathering however is an instant classic, imo THE GREATEST THRASH ALBUM EVER, just slightly edging out over Pantera's FBD and GSTK an Metallica's Puppets.  There was the old sound, beefed up beyond all hell, w/ some of the newer more deathly elements, but leveled up w/ The Hammer of the Gods, Mr Dave Lombardo and Dr Steven DiGiorgio of the Institute for Fretless Mind-Blowery.  History has proven to crap on Paul Bostaph.  Forever in the spectre of Lombardo, he additionally has to contend w/ the fact that he was called in to replace Nick Barker in a pinch, the bastard son of Gene Hoglan and Hellhammer.  I was really excited when Testament hooked up w/ Nick.  It eluded to the new album being something new, The Gathering meets The Legacy, but FASTER.  Alas, we'll never know what could've been.  Lombardo, while not blasting away like the drummers that follow in his wake, has a special way of playing, not just fast, but w/ groove, a blending of latin/jazz and punk/metal.  it doesn't matter Paul can't play as fast as Nick or Gene or can't copy Lombardo note for note, but what he does here just leaves me unimpressed.    Also, the 9/11 song is really lame.
B001736FDK|5.0|This is the first in a trilogy. These books are awesome! I've been reading a lot of fantasy books lately, and I haven't read anything lately that comes close to as enjoyable as the Bartimaeus trilogy. The narrator is a hilarious djinni that adds in footnotes to commentate on everything he says; often the comments are longer than the normal text on a page. You'll love these - they're intended for middle school age, but I still found them fun.
074325144X|4.0|The book is very informational. At the very least it helps you \\"connect\\" more with the sport, at the best it makes it easier to do and easier on your body.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|this has got to be one of the best tv shows I have ever watched, and the only one that has truely scared me at times. I love it and don't EVER want it to go off the air. Jensen Ackles is the reason I started watching it, I've loved him in everything I've seen him in, and now I can't stop. The two  brothers and the way they interact is amazing. I don't know what other actors could carry a tv show with just 2 main characters. They don't even need to be around any other recurring characters to tell a story. It's great and I recommend it for everyone. It might scare some small children though, as the Bloody Mary episode had me not wanting to look in a mirror for a week. Buy it and watch it over and over again. I have.
B000063V8S|5.0|To be honest, the series didn't really start to take off until season 3, but unlike Voyager which followed a strong first season with consistent monotony, TNG starts on a strong foot (Best of Both Worlds II) and ands on an equally, however very different, strong foot (Redemption I).      The series begins to become a little more political tackling many social issues that are very relevant today, but perhaps the my favorite parts are the small intellectual incursions into Klingon society.    ..and as with all TNG, if you can't own it, you should see it.
B0018CA996|1.0|I still keep the first two Portishead albums with me on an MP3 player.. They  are commonly playing when I go to sleep at night.  But Third is just not the Portishead that I know and love.  The deep bass heavy beats of the first album are dead and gone and this album is starting to sound even more industrial than the last.  The warmth is gone and what is left over is just not something I am interested in.    If you are a fan of the first two albums, take a good long listen to the track samples before you buy Third.  You may end up saving yourself some money.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I've watched this series from the beginning and it just keeps getting better.  It has everything a person needs in a tv series, horror, humor, and even some family fun!  Not to forget, it also stars 2 of the hottest men in tv & film!  I will never love another show like I do this series!<br />It has an awesome cast and crew, and absolutely some of the best story lines and plots ever!
B000P0J024|4.0|For an assemblage of big-name stars, the Traveling Wilburys is about as good as it gets.  Lynne, Dylan, Harrison, Orbison, and Petty team up and perform together just as well as they do when on their own with their own bands.  Usually super groups come across as contrived and shoe-horned to fit a market niche, but these guys combine in a way that, had Roy Orbison lived another 5 years or more, they might have achieved enough fame as a group to rival the fame they achieved on their own, or, in Harrison's case, as a lesser member of the Beatles.  Who knows?  The only drawback I can find is that their musical style is a bit dated, so maybe today's listeners won't be very impressed, but for nostalgic \\"boomers\\" on a fixed income you can't beat the 2 CD/1 DVD set that's being offered for sale.  Highly recommended.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE, WE'VE WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. EACH TIME WE SEE IT WE CATCH SOMETHING WE MISSED AND IT \\"ILLUMINATES\\" THINGS WE QUESTIONED. MY INLAWS ARE FROM THE UKRAINE AND IT HAS EVOKED A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE CHARACTERS HAVE EXPERIENCED AND THE EXPERIENCES MY INLAWS HAD. i ALSO READ THE BOOK. IF YOU HAVEN'T, I RECOMMEND READING IT AFTER THE MOVIE. THE BOOK HAS ANOTHER STORY WITHIN THE STORY AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSING TO READ IT FIRST. BUT THE BOOK DID HELP ME COME TO SOME POSSIBLE CONCLUSIONS AS TO SOME OF THE EVENTS OF THE MOVIE. A FUNNY, YET EMOTIONAL, THOUGHT PROVOKING MOVIE.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|If you missed this movie while it was in theatres, don't miss it on DVD.    Don't miss all the behind the scenes features, either.  In fact, watch them first and it will make the movie even better.
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|Short version: if you wanted \\"Dummy II\\" then just skip this release.      Third moves Portishead in a more mechanical and industrial direction.  The songs are distinctly more edgy, tight, and thoroughly claustrophobic with repetition.  I see this as a good thing, your mileage may vary.  Sure it may be more dissonant but it's a poppy, \\"In Rainbows\\" kind of dissonance.  (As opposed to the more difficult \\"free jazz\\" dissonance.  That stuff _really_ burns while going down.)      Portishead have always made cinematic music and Third is no different.  Songs like \\"Silence\\" and \\"Nylon Smile\\" would feel right at home in a David Lynch dream sequence; both take advantage of stylistic reptition to feature a nice anti-climax / pull-out that leaves the listener (insert your fetish here).    Repitition seems to be the theme of Third.  \\"The Rip\\", for example, opens with a banjo-fied riff that fuels the quiet desperation beneath Beth Gibbons' vocals.  The same three notes are repeated throughout, building and building the song to.. the same three notes, echoed on a keyboard.  The song is a brilliant study in dynamics and it's not until the last 45 seconds that a melodic counterpoint is established.  The sensation is that of being able to finally scratch an itch after hours and hours of being tied to a butterfly swing.  Ah, sweet relief!    Some experiments do fall flat, however.  \\"Deep Water\\" begins with a ukelele and you're practically falling over yourself to hear Stephin Merritt crooning.  But instead you're treated to what sounds like Darth Vader on backing vocals.  \\"Machine Gun\\", meanwhile, sounds like a NIN collaboration (I see this as a bad thing, your mileage may vary) that leads to one of those cheesy arena rock moment when you wave a lighter in the air.    If Dummy was a great CD, then Third is merely good.  Quite frankly, I'm mystified by the reviewers are dismissing Third as discomfiting and dark.  Uh, wasn't that the whole point of Portishead?  No, you're not going to listen to is at the beach.  You're not going to listen to it on the way to work (unless you really hate your job).  Heck, you may not listen to it more than three times a month.  Nevertheless, I remain confident that there will be days when Third will perfectly fit my mood.
B000002GQK|5.0|In my opinion, Ever Good Boy is the very best of The Moodies'\\" concept albums and perhaps the greatest concept album of all time.    From the opening track which brings us from primitive sounds of the caveman through the music of the ages and finally to the rock we all love, the album is brilliantly conceived.    My personal favorite is John Lodge's One More Time to Live.  The lyrics serve as a guide to all that's good and bad in life without being preachy. The counterpoint sung by Mike Pinder and Justin Hayward make this song a Moodies' tour de force. Very satisfying!!!
B000XA5K48|5.0|Fast paced and held your interest to the very end.  Violent with a comedic touch, if you can imagine that.  Great acting.  Can't go wrong with Clive Owen.  Paul Giamatti was a bit off the wall in his mobster roll, always receiving calls from his wife while conducting 'business' as usual.  Monica Balducci was teamed well with Clive Owen.
B0012GVKW8|5.0|well worth the price even though you already have it on dvd, just to see it in blu-ray, which is fantastic!
0143038419|4.0|This was an enjoyable book for two reasons: Elizabeth Gilbert's excellent writing skills, and the premise of the book itself. The latter, which was an outward journey (to three countries) to find inner peace, was something I can identify with. Although the Italy/Food segment lacked a bit of depth, I thoroughly enjoyed the India/Ashram part of Gilbert's adventure (especially her struggles with meditation.) The third segment in Indonesia was interesting from a cultural standpoint, although I have less respect for that culture now than I did (due to the constant pressure for women to get married and have children!)    On a down note, I could never really escape the reality that this is not just a woman alone trying to find herself after a divorce, but in fact, a successful writer who has been given an assignment by her editor (and thus a big advance, and probably expenses paid), and who flies home (to NY) in the midst of it all to celebrate the holidays and transfer her wardrobe.     We ultimately forgive Gilbert for this however, because she is a likable character with self-deprecating humor, and the imagery in her writing transforms us. Don't go with high expectations, just read it for light entertainment.
0307346617|3.0|O.K. we all know that Zombies are a prime target for authors wishing to make a metaphorical point.   The better ones, like Romero, can do it without sacrificing the quality of their work.    Let's face it.   Zombie fans do not go to a movie or pick up a Zombie book hoping to find a clever put down of \\"mindless consumerism\\" (or any other issue, for that matter) concealed within the prose.   They go to see or read complete chaos and gratuitous Zombie killing.   The problem with World War Z and it's \\"oral history\\" is that it drags on and on with hundreds of words meant to criticize this or that politician or political policy.   Greedy Corporations and inept officials ARE a problem, but do you have to clog up an otherwise very good Zombie book because you've got a political ax to grind?   I think liberals and their policies are the most horrible way to run a society ever invented, but I'm not going to write a Zombie book to tell people about it!
B000002OX7|5.0|What can I say?  This is THE Classic Who album.  One of the all time best albums ever produced by anyone.  The extra tracks threw me off though.  I've listened to this album hundreds of times over the years and hearing extra songs seemed to tarnish the original.
0316172324|4.0|Gladwell's \\"Blink\\", a fantastic follow up to \\"the Tipping Point\\", reveals what most of us have known since the dawn of Creation, but ignore none the less. Trust your gut. We can all know, in the blink of an eye, what's \\"really going on\\" in a situation or circumstance - if we'll take the time to be receptive to what's happening around us. This isn't New Age drivel, this is using your brain. He would have gotten 5 stars out of me, but the one missing component was the \\"how to blink for dummies\\" manual at the end of the book. Malcolm defines the problem with conviction and shares the solution with wit, but never really puts a finger on exactly how you can put it to work in your life. Then again, that's the beauty of it - it's there for you to find, you just need to use your brain a little more to get it. Great for business and for life, Blink is worth the read.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This is a great cd.  Every track is excellent and hearing Neal Young as a young man brought back many good memories from when these were all new songs.  I highly recommend.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I didn't love all the songs at first, but by the second time I did.  Lots of songs to remind my of early 90's R.E.M. style.  And some great tempos to keep me moving at the gym!!  I can't wait to hear them live this June!!!
B000SO7OM0|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the DVD when I got this. The visuals include some almost 'arty' cut-aways from the stage set to show some of the surrounding architecture etc including some interesting outside day shots. Very well done and appropriately enhances the viewing experience. (All the songs are on the 2 CDs as well)    The music is easy to listen to, typically celtic of course - but mixed with it's own unique flavour. Lereena's singing is easy on the ears, although I did find after a while some songs seemed similar to others. Probably not the best idea to listen to the whole show in one sitting when it is late and you are already a bit tired :)    It is always a pleasure to watch extremely skilled musicians playing.   Overall impression: great songs, good singing and an incredible setting.
0316776963|4.0|This book was absolutely entertaining! Sedaris has a knack for off the cuff ranting.  Worth a read.
B000088E6D|5.0|My favorite is his CD entitled Coming Home.  I love every song, but I must admit if you're a Michael Buble fan you will absolutely love this one too.
0143038583|5.0|I have really nothing to add that wasn't already covered in earlier reviews, except to say that I too am absolutely absorbed by this book, it's informative, interesting, relevant and the writing style is simply captivating.  I can't put it down!
B0010YSD7M|4.0|This is a good product. The featurettes (extra movies besides the actual 2 hour movie) were too few i think, it was a lot easier to find stuff on the web, but they were better than i expected. Wouldn't be a good standalone product, i mean you would have to see some seasons of Stargate to understand what happens.<br /><br />Best part of this DVD, except the Ori storyline ending, was the movie comentary of Robert C. Cooper and Chris Judge, with a good behind the scenes insight.
B00000F14B|4.0|I love how even a cold hearted con-man (played by Robert Preston) can fall in love.  How, instead of slipping away in the night, he stays to face the cosequences of his actions - all because he is conflicted over leaving his new love. The new love (played by Shirley Jones)is also cold hearted because of the walls she built up to protect herself from men with one thing on their mind. The intermixing between the two, as Robert Preston tries to capture Shirley Jones' heart is very enjoyable. This \\"G\\" rated movie also has Buddy Hackett and shows the debut of Ronnie Howard, as a stuttering boy with a pained heart. Everyone plays their part well.       Filled with music and some dance numbers, this funny little small town romp is slow moving at times, but very ejoyable, and ofter very funny. I am happy that I finally purchased it
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I saw this movie at the show and laughed through the entire movie. I loved it and couldn't wait to own it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am loving this Dvd.  Jillian is straight to the point, no b.s. in this one.  She tells it like it is.  It's not extremely difficult, but if you're looking for an \\"easy workout\\" you're going to have to skip on buying this one. I must say though, as you progress, the workouts do seem less rough on you LOL.  Great way to get a complete workout in a short amount of time!  I strongly recommend this one for sure.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I ordered this classic as a surprise gift for my father who turned 80 in 2008!  This is his favorite all time movie.  He was surprised and enjoyed the entire film.  All generations could be inspired with this movie.
0810994739|5.0|I am a reading specialist for an elementary school. The hardest thing I have is getting kids into a book.  Diary of a Wimpy Kid has done it.  One student in my class read and bragged about and now all of them want to read it.  I read  it before letting the kids after it.  I was one of the funniest adolescent books I had read in a long time.  We all loved it.
0810993139|5.0|I originally bought this book for a car trip for my 9-year-old son, and it quickly turned into \\"the book to be fought over\\" in the household, with my 10-year-old daughter wanting to read it, too!      Every time the book was set down, it quickly ended up with another reader.  If you have a child who is a reluctant reader (they would rather be playing video games, but love books when you make them turn off the TV), then this is a perfect choice.  My son even skipped dinner to finish the book!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm 59 and need to lose 20 pounds. These are the hardest exercise routines I have ever done. That being said - they work. I lost 5 pounds in 10 days and although I was more careful with what I ate, I didn't deny myself anything I really wanted. With Jillian's routines (three 20 minute routines that get progressively harder)you get cardio, abs and strength workouts. I definitely recommend this series if you are serious about weight loss. If you have any injuries you may want to go with something a little less strenuous.
B000ZN802W|1.0|Oh, my God! I have been CHANGED!! Christopher McCandless is a GOD!!! He went into the Alaskan wilderness and came out a deity to be reckoned with! He made the decision to forego all personal wealth, in search of the ultimate answer! It's SOOOOO romantic, I want to cry. ALL of you folk who didn't like this film just didn't get it!! You are people incapable of dreaming the BIG dream!! This story is so inspirational, only those who understand Chris' journey toward enlightenment can truly call themselves devotees of His Divine Majesty!!     His Family were worthless money-grubbers, His Mother was so out of touch with reality, and seeing his Father cry, at the end was so emotional (NOT). His \\"friends\\" just refused to accept that there are more important things than living on a slab of cement, out in the middle of nowhere, marking time, not caring that communing with the higher power is more important than life, itself!! And the old man? He just represented to Chris all that is wrong with humanity!! Leave all his worldly possessions to a man who has forsaken it? Was he nuts? Chris was above all that, the old coot was too stupid to see it!!    When he reached Alaska, the vistas were beautiful!! It sure looked as though it was tough to be there, but Chris just KNEW what to do!! Yes, he made a mistake shooting that moose, but it was an honest one, and he can't be faulted for not knowing how to preserve the meat. He was just a displaced city kid, after all. His run-in with the bear had the hair on the back of my neck standing up!! It's a wonder he wasn't mauled or eaten. I guess the bear realized that Chris' journey wasn't over, yet!! I cried when he found out he ate those poisoned roots, but happy, too, because his story wouldn't have been so inspiring!! He died a HERO! No doubt about it!!    You will have to forgive the one star rating. As of now, I would give this film 100 stars!! This is entertainment at it's finest!! Sean Penn captured the essence that was Christopher McCandless expertly, as an enlightened Director/Producer should!! I am ashamed to have thought that Christopher McCandless was anything but a GOD!!!!
1416562591|5.0|Ripped from the dark heart of modern-day India, comes debut novelist, Aravind Adiga, a hip Gunga Din for the millennium, blowing a hot, Ornette Cileman riff of a novel, from the top of a dirty golden dome, that is at once visceral, witty, irreverent, bloody, and ultimately, satisfying.   By the first few pages of his book, \\"The White Tiger,\\" the reader quickly forgets about finding a lyrical, fragrant India, similar to the novels of M.M. Kaye, and Vikram Seth. This is a down and dirty India, much like it's mother of a river, the Ganges. The story, as put down by it's narrator, the complex, Balram Halwai, who has risen from desperate poverty  to become a chauffer for two rich Pomeranians, rails against India's class system, and corruption, with a searing, and damning sarcasm. Adiga's haunting trumpet blast of a literary voice lingers with the reader long after the final page.   Will India be ready for his next book? I know I will.   This is one hell-of-a read.
1416914293|5.0|This book is lots of fun.  The characters are interesting and their dynamic is pretty amusing.  The forbidden romance adds a 'train wreck' kind of repulsive fascination as well.  Found myself saying out loud: 'No she didn't!'  But really develops the trilogy's plot and sets it up for a great finish...can't wait! (Though it doesn't HAVE to be a trilogy does it?  Maybe a few more?)
0740745271|4.0|I think that this is a good product, just like other books that I own.  So if you have time to look at it, this will help you relax. If you never been able to see the images have patience sometimes it takes a while read the instruction on how to do it, there are three different ways, so one of those should work for you, it's just a matter of time. Once you are able to see the images it will become easier to see there rest of the pics I remember I used to think that this stuff was fake cause I could never see I spend 3 hours looking at one page and never got it, but it was because I kept trying to look for something, what work for me was to look past the image and that would let the 3d image pop out.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I enjoyed this one much more than the cartoon version. Actually made trolls sympathetic characters.
0739366416|5.0|The audiobook version of Senator Obama's book is thoughtful and literate. It's about time we had a presidential candidate who can write and speak well on his own without the need for co-writers or ghostwriters. His life and success so far is proof of the truth of America's promise to all. Read this and his earlier autobiography of his younger years to understand the man and his view of the nation and the world we live in. With men (or women) such as him at the helm, we might again return to a positive position at home and abroad.
B00005JPUN|5.0|This was a GRRRRRREEEEAAATTTT remake of the old classic movie. You've gotta watch it. I must admit it didn't look appealing when i saw the trailers. And even when it was released on DVD the cover did'nt look appealing, but I just watched it and it was GREEAATTTT. Fantastic movie. I'm probably gonna even buy it.     This movie did well at the box office. 80 million worldwide, it probably would have done better, but the emotions of terror and suspense you go through while watching the movie didn't show in the trailers. If they had good trailers then i think thhis would have stayed longer. Great movie for the family to watch, nothing really bad .    Watch it i'm tellin ya it's good. Stars Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig (the new James Bond guy)
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|I have been very impressed by the past four albums that Madonna has made.  For the most part, they were full of well-conceived melodies, harmonies, and general production.  While Madonna's voice has never been her strongest point, even she impressed me with some solid vocal interpretation.  Some of her songs featured lyrics that weren't as deep as in others, but they showcased her intelligence well.  Therefore, when I heard she was making this album, I mentally prepared myself for another wonderful album to look forward to.  When I heard she was working with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and Pharrell, I became nervous.  Timbaland and Pharrell have very distinctive, dominating sounds that work well with the R&B/hip-hop scene, but I didn't think they'd fit with Madonna.  Once I heard the first single from the album, the sirens went off in my head.  The lyrics were completely ridiculous, Madonna sounded completely out-of-place on the track, and Timbaland's typically-remarkable production was actually floundering a bit.  It seems that ever since Janet Jackson used a marching band for her Super Bowl performance, it's become popular among hip-hop producers to use marching bands (or just their percussion sections) as an attempt to prove that they can create tracks without exclusively using synthesized background music.  I do have a major problem with marching bands, in general, but aside from that, they just sound absolutely ridiculous on R&B/hip-hop records.  Sadly, with all the money Madonna, Justin, and Timbaland have, they decided to use synthesized brass (which sounds even worse) in place of paying for a marching band's brass section to come in and record the corresponding music.  After recovering from the shock I experienced from hearing such a disaster come from the likes of Madonna, I began suspecting that this album would be a total train wreck.      Fortunately, in its entirety, the album just barely holds together.  \\"4 Minutes\\" and \\"Spanish Lesson\\" should have been completely left off the album, as far as I'm concerned.  \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"Give It 2 Me\\", and \\"Incredible\\" are a little less lyrically mind-numbing, and at least the production helps to save them.  The rest of the tracks turned out well and are far better suited to Madonna.  \\"Dance 2night\\", \\"Miles Away\\", and \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" stood out to me immediately, and I just wish that the entire album could have been constructed with as much care and sensibility as these were.  I feel that until now, Madonna has been wonderful at keeping herself ahead of today's unfortunate popular music scene, using producers *other* than  the ones who flood the Billboard Hot 100 chart each week.  What made her so appealing was that her music sounded different than everything else out there, seemingly tinged with the wisdom someone as experienced and intelligent as she is would possess.  From the title, to the album art, to the producer choices, to the quality of the lyrics, this album just feels as if Madonna is starting to bow, and that's *not* the Madonna we have come to know during her vibrant career.  Ironically, despite the title of this album, it is not nearly as sweet as her previous one.  Nonetheless, this album is far better than most of the music coming out these days in the same genre, and for that I commend her.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|For many Journey's Escape album sums up the 1980's. The first album that featured Johnathan Cain on keyboards, and in my opinion Steve Perry's peak as a vocalist. The last of Journey's 1970's sound left with Gregg Rolie (Journey's original keyboardist, who is exceptional in his own right), and Escape is an album that for all intensive purposes should be considered a classic. From the rockers \\"Don't Stop Believin\\" and \\"Stone In Love\\" to the ballad \\"Open Arms;\\" this CD has enough power, emotion, and exceptional song writing that it could be considered a greatest hits on it's own merit. Perry's voice is authentic, rich and flawless. Neil's guitar work is right on the money as usual. Not to mention that Steve Smith, Johnathan Cain, and Ross Valory's contributions are without question perfect. This is a can't miss CD (and there arn't many of them out there). Pick it up, listen, and you will hear the best Pop Rock the 1980's had to offer...<br /><br />Bottom Line: Can't miss classic Pop Rock Album.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Looking for an American Dream? A hero? A moral stand against evil? Redemption through faith? Or good works? Love?  Keep looking...   Well made to a fault, this film is an ordeal to endure the gritty, painful, flawed lives of its characters, while looking for redemption.  Looking for any virtues at all, but almighty lust for money and oil?  You'll not find them here.  The American Dream is portrayed as an american nightmare, determined, evil and driven beyond humanity.   This film (and presumably Sinclair) suceeds in painting the \\"oil man\\" into a crude JR prototype, without the glitz and glamour.  It's not a pretty picture.  It's not a pretty film.  It's a depressing 158-minute downer, waiting for some redeeming feature:     If not characters, scenery? - also barren and depressing.    Uplifting score? - Greenwood's derisive, grating strings sound like an orchestra warming up, but never playing.    Great dialogue? - Makes Sergio Leone's tight-lipped spaghetti westerns seem witty by comparison.   If your cup of tea is crude, your gold is black, and your religion is lust of money (even at the expense of your family), you'll love this movie.  Rent it today! (Don't forget some dirt to grind your teeth on).
0736063684|2.0|The information provided in this book is not rigorously based on in-depth knowledge of human anatomy and exercise kinesiology. For example, the Bridging exercise is shown in this book to exercise only th buttock muscle. Anyone who has done this exercise will know that it works the lower back just as much if not more. It seems that the author simply assumed what is going on without much studies. The only value of this book is all the drawings. It may help some people understand their muscle better and can be used as a simple reference but should not be taken seriously. It is not really worth buying for people who just want to learn how to exercise. It doesn't really give you ideas on how to plan your workout.

0061020680|4.0|To people who have never read a Discworld novel, I always recommend they skip the first three novels (The Colour of Magic, The Light Fantastic, Equal Rites)and start with Mort.  Pratchett writes the Discworld novels as a series of threads with a small collection of one-off novels.  The novels are not written in chronological order.  He may do a sequel to one novel and then some time later do a sequel to an earlier novel.    Mort starts what I call the Death thread and my daughter calls the Susan thread, Susan (Death's Granddaughter) being her favorite character.  It continues with Reaper Man, Soul Music, Hogfather, and Thief of Time.  Although the events of these novels interact with the events in his other Discworld novels, (Thief of Time, for instance sets up the events in Night Watch) it is not necessary to have read the others to enjoy these.  Nor (I stress this) is it necessary, or even desirable, to read the novels in published order.    Why skip the first three published novels?  In my opinion, Pratchett started out writing mediocre parody of other fantasy authors, (Fritz Leiber, Anne McCaffrey, Robert E. Howard, among others) but then, something really clicked with Mort - starting out as a parody of Death Takes a Holiday, it takes an abrupt turn and becomes something truly original and compelling -- funny, sad, silly, and truly suspenseful.  The Discworld novels after Mort, with only a couple exceptions, got better and better until Pratchett reached his peak with Night Watch, a novel which transcends fantasy and becomes Literature.    If you must know what happens in the first two novels, see the movie The Colour of Magic released early 2008 on British television, which covers both books.  The movie is better than the books. :-)    Mort -- Highly recommended, and the start of a journey you will enjoy immensely.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna's 11th studio of new material pleases from begin inning to end. The Queen of Everything never ceases to amaze me or her fans around the world. I anticipate every single one of her releases the second I hear that she is in the studio; this release is no exception to that rule.<br />Hard Candy is a genius CD from song 1 and continues all the way through. Madonna does turn her attention to a more urban sound but all while still keeping with her dance and pop roots. There are so many songs on this set that remind me of many of her classics with a heavier bass line. So, if you were a bit leery of too much of a hip hop sound; do not be. Any fan of Madonna's knows that all her albums have some sort of theme throughout and I would classify Hard Candy is a brilliant Pop/Hip Hop CD. It's not the same pop/hip hop stuff you hear all the time on the radio that has that recycled sound either. Like Madonna, the sounds, beats and melodies are all fresh and inventive.<br /><br />Every song on here is amazing with the exception of: \\"Spanish Lesson\\". This is a song I just cannot get to like as much as the others on here. It's not a bad song it just seems a bit out of place on here.<br /><br />Songs to play on repeat:<br />\\"Candy Shop\\"<br />\\"4 Minutes\\"<br />\\"Give it 2 Me\\" - will be her next single<br />\\"She's Not Me\\"<br />\\"Beat Goes On\\" - with a stellar rap from Kanye West<br />\\"The Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\"<br /><br />This is a must have for any Madonna fan and/or anyone who just wants a great party CD. I can see Grammy's being won for this CD. Genius yet very fun all at the same time.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|In \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes,\\" on the Absolution album, Matt Bellamy sings, \\"Best... you've got to be the best... you've got to change the world and you use this chance to be heard.\\"  He certainly heeds his own advice, as is evidenced in the politically charged lyrics of \\"Take a Bow,\\" opening song on the new Black Holes and Revelations album. He tells our current leaders that they will \\"burn in hell for their sins.\\"  The question is whether he is speaking to Bush or Blair.  Probably both.  As harsh as this message might sound, it pales in comparison to the call to arms in \\"Assassin,\\" where \\"the time has come for you to shoot your leaders down.\\"  Ouch. At any rate, Muse has become a worldwide phenomenon, selling out three consecutive nights of shows at Wembley Stadium, and they are utilizing their popularity to inspire their fans to do something.      \\"Supermassive Black Hole,\\" has been both praised and criticized.  Its inspiring of opposite reactions is likely due to the atypical sound.  Synthesizers boom in a low register while Bellamy's voice floats above in falsetto.  The cliché is tongue in cheek, \\"I thought I was a fool for noone, but ooh baby, I'm a fool for you.\\"  I dare you not to groove along with this song.  Opposites are a strong theme in \\"Starlight\\" as well.  Wolstenholme `s base line is just delicious, and as in \\"Supermassive,\\" its depth is set off by the higher keys of Matt's voice and piano.  \\"I just wanted to hold you in my arms\\" shows a yearning for closeness, but there is a great sense of desolation: \\"this ship is taking me far away, far away from the memories of the people who care if I live or die.\\"  The music and the lyrics are so bittersweet, as in \\"Map of the Problematique,\\" which opens with \\"fear and panic in the air.\\"  While the apocalypse is present throughout the album, it is most pronounced here.  These lyrics echo those in great apocalyptic literature, where the final survivors struggle with their finality in isolation.      The voiceof the hero is never so pure as in \\"Soldier's Poem.\\"  It sounds like an Elvis Presley ballad, but beneath the sweet harmonies lies an acerbic depiction of someone serving their country yet challenging those defended to question the rationality of war and the actuality that there is no justice.   It is so angry, yet wrapped in pretty paper, that it makes you giggle at the absurdity of it all.  Don't doubt that this is the intent.      \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" runs on the pace of a horse's gallop, calling attention to the four horsemen in the cover art.  It is such a phenomenal way to end the album (as well as live concerts), with octave-spanning accapellas and heavily rocking guitar riffs.  It also ends the apocalyptic theme with a statement of fortitude, not at all going quietly into the great night.      The genius of Muse is head spinning, especially for a three piece band.  If Matt Bellamy were only the lyricist he is, the vocalist, guitarist, or keyboardist, he would be a major talent, but the quadruple threat amplifies his genius to an unheard of level.  Was this boy genetically engineered (as the puppies in \\"Plug in Baby\\" on Origin of Symmetry), bred and raised by a Mensa society, or spat here by God himself as a gift to music lovers?  He is his own four horsemen, isn't he? If he is heralding the end of the world, then, yeah, that sucks, but at least now I have that one album I'd like to take with me.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Superhero movies are a mixed bag. Sometimes you get a good one that captures the heart of what made the comic book popular (Spider-Man, Batman Begins), and sometimes they just go all weird for no reason (Superman Returns, The Hulk). \\"Iron Man\\" has captured that perfect feel for a comic book movie.<br /><br />First, we go to a movie called \\"Iron Man\\" to SEE Iron Man, and director Favreau doesn't disappoint. We see him four times in the three different incarnations (original, plain iron, and the gold-and-red). The sequences are action-packed and perfect.<br /><br />Second, Robert Downey Jr. is dead-on as Tony Stark. He has this smirky personality yet he manages to stay down to earth at the same time. You actually feel for this character and laugh in the moments he's creating the armor (the jet boot sequences are hilarious).<br /><br />Finally, the storyline itself. It's a perfect origin story that remains true to the comics while still giving us something new. You can tell Jon has had a lot of time with the comics by giving little nods to the real comic book fans out there (wondering about War Machine? There's a hint in the movie).<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest and greatest fanboy moment of all comes after the credits have finished rolling. You've got to sit through a LOT of them, but trust me: DON'T MOVE! The final one minute sequence sets the stage perfectly for where Jon wants to take the movies in the future.<br /><br />I loved this film. I can't recommend it highly enough. I just hope they allow Jon to direct the next two AND the Avengers movie (if it ever comes out). Just like Sam Raimi captured the essence of Spider-Man in the first movie, Jon has Iron Man down pat.
B0013527I4|5.0|This is the season the show finally hit it's stride.  The episode with Harry Belefonte was nominated for an Emmy Award (r); Henson and Oz seem to get the best from the visiting talent, including dancing and singing from Raquel Welch (who'd've thought); and the maturing of the Muppet supporting characters, especially Miss Piggy and Gonzo.  The production numbers are more imaginative, the jokes are a little more contemporary, the talent more A list.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|I really hoped and watched every episode. With the last one being the worst and totally unnecessary.    It is so sad that American can't make a decent representation of time of \\"Founding Fathers\\".   The fantastic Mr. Giamatti is \\"starched\\" due to the idiotic, cartoon like direction and teleplay of John Adams. Can't they at least try to make these people human and show some of the true facts about these people.  The funniest character, or should I say, Disney animated status was George Washington. Due to the poor directing and writing that was inflicted on a fine actor, I think in the Hall olf Presidents in Disneyland has their George Washington animated robot showing expression and movement that this statuesque character.  So much of the depth, details, real struggles, real motives of these men were left out, making them and especially John Adams a humorless, pompous cliche maker, as if he had no thoughts but about the U.S.   They also just slid over the slavery issues.  The most puzzling and non-defined or man without a motive character was their poorly directed and define Thomas Jefferson. There was no way to have any feeling of who he really was and why he did what he did. Sometimes almost hippie like, an outsider, disinterested, turned into with no reason a egomaniacal playboy who just wanted to go to France and party and grasp the power of the country. Made no sense.   I am sure the book must be excellent, but another failure of giving the Father's of our Country some humanity and dimensions. Read Gore Vidal's Burr and watch the characters come alive off the page.  Poor John Adams, he got old and no body cared about him, too bad, so sad,   so pompous and so untrue.   I'm sure producer Hanks and whoever the director was just didn't have any guts to show who these people were. The best part was the costumes.     jon
0920668372|5.0|I have bought this book for all of my children and for everyone that I know who has had a baby, it is the best children's book ever in my opinion. Will make you laugh, will make you cry. Helps children to realize how much we love them, even when they are mischievious and that they are always our babies. Highly recommended!
B00005JPS7|5.0|Wow. Wow. Talk about a great film forget about the people who say this movie fails. Iron Man the movie is not only a great adaptation of the comic hero but is a great movie in general. It has it all: Special effects, great acting, interesting, realistic characters and a very modern story. Of course this is also attributed to the fact that comic book itself has all these qualities as well. For anyone who wants more of Iron Man after watching the movie, I would highly suggest getting in the comic you won't be disappointed!!!    (Spoilers)  The comic of course was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Larry Lieber, and Don Heck.    The film follows the comic book very well (with a couple of alterations such as it taking place in the West Coast instead of the East Coast for example).    Backstory: Iron Man or should I say Tony Stark (who in my opinion is one of the most underrated comic book heroes who doesn't quite the same publicity as Bob Kane's Batman) is a wealthy socialite who makes his life building and selling weapons. In a way just like Bruce Wayne, Tony Stark is a business superhero. Also, unlike Spider-Man, The Hulk and other comic book heroes there isn't a mutant or radioactive, gamma force that gives the hero his power, the power lies in the man's own ability to use his intellect, wits, bravery and judgment to combat the villains and problems he encounters.     Tony Stark, Iron Man fights against a corporation/terrorist group known as Ten Rings in Afghanistan. In the comic book, Iron Man has many adventures fighting groups that have profited and used his own weapon systems from Stark Industries.    Stark is forced to create a replica of one of his Jericho missiles for the group or face death. Worse yet, Stark having felt a blast that has left shrapnel near his heart MUST wear a chest plate to protect his heart. Yinsen (another prisoner) is the man who has kept Stark alive and  helps create the prototype of Iron Man with him. Yinsen helps Tony get the necessary time to get Iron Man up and running. This leads to an impressive special effects action sequence that led to a lot of clapping and cheering with the audience I saw it with.    After this recovery from death and from the words of Yinsen who tells him not to waste his life, Stark has a major epiphany. He no longer wants to make weapons of destruction, he wants to save lives. His business partner Obadiah Stone does not share Stark's new vision and this leads to several dramatic scenes and more superb special effects with Iron Man. I will not spoil what else happens except that it's excellent.    Before watching the movie, I saw an interview with Jon Favreau who said he was going to make a movie that would make lovers of the comic book happy but also make a movie simple enough that you didn't have to be an expert in it. What a smart guy he is. Jon is a good director but this was by far his biggest project. I mean Marvel wants to make a franchise of Iron Man just like they did with Spider-Man so a lot was riding on the line and Favreau delivered a home run!!!    Speaking of home runs, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was unbelievable I cannot think now in retrospect a better pick for the role. Jeff Bridges was great and Gwyneth Paltrow were also very good.  I'am glad they went with this cast and didn't go for the younger cast which would not have achieved the same results of this very adult oriented comic book hero's life.      Again going back to why this movie is so successful: It's not dumb down, we got a moral dilemma with a guy coming to grips over the destruction that comes from his business but is starting to correct it, we got several shots at the corporate culture putting profit ahead of lives, we get a nice romantic storyline here, we  have multidimensional characters, and lastly we got great special effects. On top of all this we have a good attempt to follow the comic book hero.     I don't know what else to say if what I say hasn't convinced you that Iron Man isnot just a great comic book movie but a great movie in general then there's nothing I can do. However, you will be missing out on one heck of a great movie. Thumbs way up!!!!!!!!!!!
0064431789|5.0|Second best children's book ever. My 15 month old son LOVES it, as did his older siblings when they were little. The song \\"wild thing\\" fits in well when the wild rumpus begins... highly recommended!
B00005JPS7|5.0|I'm married to the uber geek master of the universe. I think he would give Iron Man 10 stars. He's a comic book/graphic novel/sf guru. I hope he writes a review, but here is my take. I very much enjoyed Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. owns the part. It is amazing to watch his character evolve and see the light.  It was a bit violent for me, but the story is excellent with lots of plot twists. The pacing was very good. The special effects for the most part were fabulous and did not take over the plot. There is a lot of humor and just a little romance. This is sure to be the blockbuster start of an awesome summer movie season. Watch to the end of the credits for a peak at the next issue (I mean Iron Man II).
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Sweet and touching.  When making this film about singers and composers, the director had the choice of choosing actors who could be taught to sing and compose, or singer composers who could be taught to act.  The director thankfully made the second choice.  Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are wonderful, sensitive and alive singer composers whose creativity and heart come through over and over.  This is a very sweet and touching film.  Buy or rent it today.
B000G0O5N2|4.0|I loved this movie.  It is far from the best Blu-ray conversion however as it is barely better than regular DVD.  To be expected I supposed as it was one of the earlier titles.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|I had high expectations.  I had heard from several Battlestar Galactica fans that this was an \\"awesome\\" series, almost as good as Battlestar, so I bought the DVDs . . . uh, No, this is not great science fiction.  It is a silly, over-the-top melodrama set in an improbable future with some really bad acting.  It's a comic Western (they even talk in campy 19th-century cowboy-speak) set on a space-barge whose crew flies from one ill-concieved scheme to escape-the-law, get-rich-quick, save-the-girl, save-the-universe to another and somehow gets out alive before the end credits. I'm trying to think of another show with a similar flavor, and for some reason, I have to say \\"Desperate Housewives\\" meets \\"Brett Maverick\\" in space --  very campy and contrived.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|I have loved the music of this lady for a while. She is blessed with gordeous voice. However, I feel this CD hides her talents.

B0000D8HDF|5.0|I will admit up front that I do now own many of Katsaris' recordings, I do know that he is a pianist of the rare breed for our modern times: he composes, improvises, conducts the piano. To put this important element in perspective, that is precisely what Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev and even Horowitz did. It's one thing to be a performer, another to be a composer/performer. To dare build on someone elses work is quite something, improvisation an art long gone in today's world of \\"perform, don't interpret\\" pianism. Once appointed head of the new Budapest Conservatory of Music, Liszt required that all pianists study improvisation and composition. No compromises. That level of pianism is what Katsaris brings to us.    I am not saying that Katsaris did his own thing with this recording, let me be clear with that. He performs the Liszt as he wrote it, and the only changes were additions in a couple of measures that he discloses in a personal statement in the insert. What Katsaris does do is bring out a level of sound in the piano tha I had not encountered previously. I am a faithful of the Karajan recordings of the Symphonies, and now I find myself enjoying the piano versions even more. Since Katsaris embodies the pianist, the composer and the director, he makes a perfect fit for this compilation of Beethoven's work made to the piano by his disciple Liszt.     The playfulness of the first two Symphonies, the majesticness of the Third, the thundrous Fifth, the melodic Sixth, the innovative Seventh and the crown jewel, the Ninth, all reproduced by two hands (and feet!).   To my knowledge, the only other recent full recording was made as part of Leslie Howard's massive enterprise of recording all of Liszt's piano music. Before that, I believe this collection was recorded before the 1950s.    The sound is clear and the piano is fierce in this recording, and I would recommend it to any lover of Beethoven and Liszt. Since this is a collection rarely recorded, it is hard to compare and make assessments. I do know that it is a great companion to piano lovers, and a great object of study for those interested to listen how Liszt (barely) completed the monumental task of reducing a full orchestra to two daring hands.

B0001WTVUW|5.0|The special effects are dated, that aside, one of the most potent movies I've ever seen.  With the increased rise in misinformation about what a nuclear exchange truly entails this is one movie everyone on earth should be forced, at gun point, to watch.  There is no excuse for anyone to be ignorant of the most basic of facts about nuclear apocalypse.  That anyone thinks it might be survivable is a fool, that some of these are in positions to make decisions or elect leaders to make decisions is apocalyptic, I do not speak in hyperbole here.  This movie, makes the actors seem real, goes through their lives for as long as it takes to make them real, then shows one the teeth of the apocalypse.  At the end it is stated that almost total annihilation, sterility and death are the BEST CASE SCENARIO.  They see fit to show that it doesn't matter how rich or pious or white you are, that all flesh is grass by the light of a nuclear sunrise.
B000083C49|5.0|[[ASIN:B000083C49 Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]    Simply, for my money, this is the best movie done exclusively by the Star Trek - TOS group.  Adventure, social commentary of the 1980's (it is getting a little dated but holds up well). Some may not like the preachy attitude as well.  The movie is just the start, all kinds of special features that will keep you entertained and informed.  My personal favorite was the text commentary, as it is in all of the movies that I have in the Star Trek (Two Disc Special Collecters edition).
0452289963|2.0|Honestly, I can see this is an immensely popular book, and I mean no respect to Oprah; but, the book is a bit of a downer.  Call me an optimist, but I like information that's uplifting and gives you suggestions on how to lift yourself out of the sometimes-too-often sticking points in life.  A New Earth, although, pointing out many faults with our over inflated egos, just left me feeling kind of sad and lifeless.    If you're searching for a way to bring yourself up, in many ways, try books by Esther and Jerry Hicks--the Abraham Consciousness.  Great practical advice on how to deal with depression, unhappiness, lack of abundance, or anything you're feeling needs some help.  And it's simple too!  New Earth is just too much information.  I don't think you need all that to find your joy on this planet.   To sum up, if you're really looking to analyze why we do....everything, check this book out.  Don't think it will leave you feeling the joy you might be searching for, but a very observant view of humans and our motivations.  Hope that helped.  Nancy P.
0140386335|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest - certainly one of the most well-known - works of German juvenile literature in the last century. And it is so much more than simply a fantasy adventure, although it certainly doesn't lack in entertainment value.  The book is actually imaginative literature that makes the imagination itself its main subject. It is about the proper handling of one's imagination and how to SAVE the imagination as an essential part of being human. The English reader might not immediately notice this, but the German reader will. In the German original, Fantastica/Fantasia is called &#34;Phantasien,&#34; which is derived from the German word for &#34;imagination.&#34; Thus, Fantastica could be called &#34;The Realm of One's Imagination.&#34;  For a full appreciation of the book, it is important to recognize this. When Bastian, the main character, steals The Neverending Story from an antique book store and starts reading it, he doesn't enter (within the fictitious world of the story) a real place such as Narnia or Hogwarts. Rather, he enters his own imagination and needs to learn to handle his imagination well.  Being an outsider in school, Bastian is tempted to use his imagination in a bad way, namely for egoistical daydreams in which he imagines himself doing whatever he likes and taking revenge on others. Slowly, he learns that this is not the proper way of handling his imagination - that self-absorbed daydreaming is harmful.  So he learns to save his imagination from the threat of &#34;Nothing,&#34; which is eating up Fantastica.  The intended parallel isn't hard to find. Michael Ende was a man deeply concerned about the loss of people's imagination in modern culture (about the &#34;nothingness&#34; eating it up), and both his novel &#34;Momo&#34; and &#34;The Neverending Story&#34; deal with this.  Whether you are young or old, whether you intend this book for yourself or your children, it is ideal for growing one's imagination as well as reflecting on its precious realm.
0446402389|4.0|Mr Smith uses as his backdrop the Stalinist Soviet Union of the 1950s, combines elements of the real case of Andrei Chikatilo, and delivers an engrossing and impressive debut novel.<br /><br />Leo Demidov, a decorated war hero, is unswervingly loyal to the State.  The body of a young boy is found on train tracks in Moscow, and his family are convinced the child was murdered.  Leo's superiors order him to ignore this information and, while he obeys, he senses there is more to the case.<br /><br />Action moves quickly: combining elements of jealousy, suspicious paranoia and human survival where reality is defined and enforced by the State.  In this atmosphere, Leo is disgraced and exiled to a distant town where more murdered children are discovered.<br /><br />There are a number of layers to this story.  While some aspects are predictable, it is the way in which Mr Smith combines the pieces which make this such an absorbing read.  Who is the murderer, and how many children have been murdered?  Will Leo, his wife Raisa, and their marriage survive?  Along the way, this novel touches on both the best and the worst of humanity.<br /><br />`To stand up for someone was to stitch your fate into the lining of theirs.'<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel, and I look forward to reading more from Mr Smith.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith

B000E41MRC|4.0|When I decided to purchase Triumph of the Will a few weeks ago, I saw that Amazon had two releases, this one and another that was much more costly. The descriptions weren't very helpful in distinguishing between the two releases.<br /><br />I'm always leery of cheap releases of titles that are in the public domain, but I decided to take a chance on this one. I'm glad to report that I wasn't disappointed. I can't compare the two releases, but I can tell you that Synapse Films, which published this version, did a good job of it.<br /><br />I haven't watched the entire DVD, but I immediately spot-checked it for quality.The digital restoration is decent and the commentary by Dr. Anthony Santoro is worthwhile, possibly even up to the standard that I have been accustomed to in Criterion Collection releases.<br /><br />One quirk: The screen format is called windowboxed. Don't let this bother you. The original, of course, was shot in the then-standard 1.33:1 ratio. The opening titles of this release are reduced, so that you get the feeling that you are watching it in a movie theatre, but after the titles, the image fills out the entire standard-ratio TV screen.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|First thing first! Forget Confessions...This is not Confessions part two...It was a great album but this is \\"Hard Candy\\". That outta the way. One thing Madonna is not, is boring. All her albums are unique and sound nothing like each other. She constantly reinvents herself and this album is no exception. She takes what's hip and makes it her own. I must admit, when I first heard this album I was shocked and dissapointed. But I didn't let that discourage me after all this is Madonna we are talking about.   1. Candy Shop - 5/10   Not really feeling it...the lyrics aren't bad...it's the vocals  2. 4 Minutes - 8/10  An ok song...great for clubs...could've been better...too bad Madonna is the backup here  3. Give It 2 Me - 10/10  Great song...Totally feeling the Paul Oakenfold Edit...It's incredible and a must buy if u have itunes at ur disposal  4. Heartbeat - 10/10  Has great beats,good vocals, and nice lyrics...  5. Miles Away - 10/10  Another Great song...Very soft and personal lyrics...Nice Vocals too...  6. She's Not Me - 8/10  Nice lyrics...Should've been a little more fast paced...  7. Incredible - 7/10  Ok song...nothing too over the top  8. Beat Goes On - 8/10  Good song overall...Nice beat, nice lyrics...\\"toot toot...beep beep\\"...lol   9. Dance 2night - 7/10  It's juss missing that something....  10. Spanish Lesson - 1/10  I like the beat but...Worst lyrics Ever!!!!! Sum of the translations don't even go...  11. Devil Wouldn't Recognize You - 20/10  My Favorite Track on the album....Very beautiful and sounds like \\"Power of Good-bye\\"...Would make a great third single...  12. Voices - 10/10  Great song to close the album...\\"who is the master?...who is the slave?\\"
B0018CAANG|4.0|First, let me say I'm biased. I have been listening to Madonna and following her career since her debut album which I still think is her BEST. I don't like everything she does, (movies, etc), but its always<br />FUN to see her taking new challenges on and I think she looks GREAT!<br />The latest CD offering \\"Hard Candy\\" is a FINE effort that will not disappoint. I was a little skeptical of her utilizing the talents of Justin Timberlake, Timbaland,et al, but this is very PLEASING.<br />It's refreshing to hear Madonna continuing to take risks to broaden her appeal. At times she misses here, but not enough to spoil a GREAT effort and a welcome new disc!  Atreides
0307346617|4.0|Seems the horror genre has been bereft of writing talent for the past 20 years.  There has not been much I've found compelling.  I haven't finished the majority of horror books I've picked up....and most of the ones I did read completely I finished begrudgingly.    Not World War Z.  Structuring the book as a series of unconnected interviews, Max Brooks weaves together an engrossing picture of a world infested with Zombies and how individuals coped with the growing horror.    Brooks use of the unconnected interview works well for this type of storytelling.  An example is the beach in India packed with people scrambling to get out to the boats and away from the terror among them.   The chaos and desperation is painted so vividly that one can imagine the horror of standing on that beach.    I do agree that because the book is a series of short interviews, each character is done in a shallow manner...and thus Brooks falls back on the occasional stereotype in order set each character apart in a distinct manner.  There is also the occasional clanger, as when the Italian starts using football references.      Another drawback is the politically correct slants to much of the characters.  We hear much of sexism, racism, stupid Americans, glorious Cubans, etc.  This approach starts to weigh down the narrative after a while with it's sophomoric Freshman Comp 101 style faux-intellectualism.     This is an interesting book.  A great format coupled with good writing.  Would have been much better if he ditched the snotty socio-political agenda.
B0014DBZT2|5.0|Dig Lazarus Dig!!! is one of my favorite Nick Cave albums.  In particular I am fond of the title track, Night of the Lotus Eaters and We Call Upon the Author.  The poetic turns of phrase and dark sense of humor are tightly balanced in Cave's most recent outing.  It is also interesting to hear how Nick and the Bad Seeds have begun exploring the subtleties of Warren Ellis' electronic loops to great effect.  I am very pleased with this album and if you are a fan of Nick Cave, I think you will be too.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|Coming on like a two man [[ASIN:B00000JC6C Flaming Lips]], MGMT layers stacks of distorted keyboards, psychedelic swirl and helium voiced lyrics to make a debut that aggressively courts your attentions, all while simultaneously making snarky comments behind your back. \\"\\"Lets make some music, make some money, find some models for wives,\\" they sing, just before asking about shooting heroin in France on the first single \\"Time to Pretend.\\" Catchy and subversive..which scores points with me every time.<br /><br />Yes, they are smart-alecs, but the music has the goods to back them up. (Think also; [[ASIN:B000M3452Y LCD Soundsystem]].) There are plenty of catchy songs here, echoing everything from the previously mentioned F'Lips to David Bowie's [[ASIN:B00001OH7V Heroes]]. They even drop the sarcasm long enough to write a good broken heart ballad, \\"Pieces of What.\\" Throughout \\"Oracular Spectacular,\\" the sound remains lush and full, offering up new details on subsequent listens. A touch more variety in the songwriting would probably make this a bit more interesting, but for a debut, MGMT have their mission statement in place.

B000MQC9H4|1.0|I found the whole scenario of this movie, contrived and fake.    (1) How many young women even live in gigantic Malibu mansions with a swimming pool, gym, and huge kitchen?  (2) If they do, would they then be naive enough to let a foreign total stranger live in their mansion, drive their car un-insured in the dangerous madhouse of L.A.'s traffic (and in the opposite road lane that British are accustomed to), and to use all their valuable stuff on just a day's notice?    (3) Who would impulsively pay the exorbitant air fares that airlines charge for last-minute flight bookers, as both women did, to visit a place they have no connection with and have no friends at?    (4) How could a single woman like Kate Winslet, logistically, possibly work in downtown London and then commute so far out every day to a big rural drafty, thatched-roof Farm house? (No Londoner, especially a single woman, ever lives like that).  The village's charm was over-stereotyped.    (5) What woman, smart and successful enough to afford a mansion like Cameron Diaz, would naively open the door to a drunken stranger late at night in the middle of nowhere (in a snowstorm), and then 8 minutes later have sex with him, when she was planning to fly home the next day?  This casual, mindless treatment of sex is disgusting, especially for a Christmas film.  Do all these women viewers really find this romantic?  Then there's something really wrong with them.  I had no sympathy for Cameron after this scene.   (6) Finally, the spoken line about Cary Grant being from Surrey is incorrect - he was instead a native of Bristol).

B000AADYRQ|5.0|This album has made me an enthusiastic new fan of Death Cab for Cutie. I like the mix of ballads and higher-speed tunes (even though I do wish the radio DJs would please stop playing \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" ad nauseum... clearly they failed to learn from \\"Under the Bridge\\" in the 90s how overplaying can turn a perfectly good tune into a worn-out, trite cliche that makes you switch the station). The lyrics are excellent and the melodies mesmerizing. Also, I love how there isn't one bad track on the album. This is one CD I continually play through from start to finish, then start over and play it again.
0525950079|3.0|If you've read Pillars of the Earth, you've read World Without End. Despite the passage of two centuries, the characters are essentially the same, as are the plotlines.  Jack is now Merthin, Aliena is now Caris, and William Hamleigh is Ralph Fitzgerald. Merthin and Caris are separated by plot contrivances that the reader can be certain will be overcome. As in Pillars of the Earth, the characters are all two-dimensional, drawn with nary a shade of grey. The narrative also misses the cohesion of a Prior Phillip, probably the most interesting character in Pillars. However, some new characters do brighten the pages, such as Caris's poor friend Gwenda, a desperate, hard-working woman who leaves the family that allowed her to be traded for a cow. I actually found Lady Philippa and Brother Thomas, two minor characters, to be among the most interesting characters, possibly because the writer did not focus as much attention to their motives and thoughts.  The writer also spent far too much time and detail on the details of bridge-making and cathedral-repairing.    All these complaints said, I couldn't put the book down. I stayed up `til past 3 for two nights until the book was finished. The author does an excellent job of describing Kingsbridge as well as the culture of the middle ages. I also enjoyed reading about the conflicts the warrior class, as exemplified by Ralph, the church, as exemplified by Godfrey, and the merchant class, as exemplified by Caris's faather. Too bad that wasn't more fully developed! World Without End is very much a plot-driven book. So, borrow the book from the library or a friend, and enjoy.
B000PAAJYW|4.0|P.T. Anderson's 1999 film MAGNOLIA is one heck of an ensemble drama. Its main characters include a dying television executive (Jason Robards), his nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman), his wife (Julianne Moore), a LAPD police officer (John C. Reilly), a game show host (Philip Baker Hall), his coked-up daughter (Melora Walters), a sleazy \\"how to score with women\\" guru (Tom Cruise, in the best performance of his career), a child prodigy (Jeremy Blackman), and a former child prodigy (William H. Macy). Over the course of one day in San Fernando Valley the relationships between them are shown through a series of fateful encounters. The great theme of MAGNOLIA is the sins of the fathers visited upon their children. The film has a surprise ending, which works as a deus ex machina, not only resolving all the different plot strands in one instant, but also symbolizing God's intervening hand, freeing the younger characters so that they may live their own lives.<br /><br />MAGNOLIA is a powerful film. As a young man I saw it many times in the theatre when it came out, and I continue to watch it on DVD often enough. There is a fine screenplay, often praiseworthy acting, impressive cinematography, and a great soundtrack by Aimee Mann. That said, after developing a better understanding of the world of film (I've become something of a 1960s auteur film snob), I am more critical of it. Unlike many who find fault with the film, I don't think that the film overstays its welcome at 3 hours. However, the opening, where Anderson presents three (pseudo-)historical tales of amazing coincidences, is entertaining enough, but it could have easily been cut without affecting the main of the film. What Anderson should not have cut, on the other hand, is the subplot involving Orlando Jones as an inner-city murderer, elements of which have been left in but which make little sense without the whole.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the film, the two-disc edition is well worth getting. The extra Frank \\"T.J.\\" Mackey material is hilarious, and the making-of documentary, far from being promotional fluff like all too many, is relevatory about Anderson's film-making process.al is hilarious, and the making-of documentary, far from being promotional fluff like all too many, is relevatory about Anderson's film-making process.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Funny how it takes more than several plays to appreciate new music sometimes. I wasn't thrilled with Third the first couple of plays, but now I think it's completely brilliant! So much so that I've been playing it repeatedly all week long. If you're expecting a continuation of what they did on the first two albums, you'll likely be disappointed. Third is really not triphop as it is a new and successful direction for the band. It's much more experimental and minimalist with droning textures over more of an industrial beat, but there are also some very etherial ballads that make for an interesting contrast. It's good to hear that Portishead didn't take the easy way and rehash what was done 10 years ago, they reinvented themselves with excellent results.

He tells us it is not a few big chunks we want, but many small nuggets.<br /><br />Modern examples are Amazon.com and NetFlix, both of which sell plenty of Harry Potter products and the like. They also (or rent, as is with NetFlix) lots of less popular products. They hit the niche market hard. That's the gold.<br /><br />The long tail is the curve's far end. At the top of the curve is Harry Potter, for example, along with other New York Times Bestsellers. These products certainly represent a significant amount of sales. However, so do the accumulated number of books and movies which might sell only a few copies a year. Add those up, and there is serious profit. While the tail in the curve is not high, it is long. One copy of, say. [[ASIN:B000AYEL7Y The Love]], a Hungarian film, and one copy of [[ASIN:B00006SFAR The Very Best of Ralph Stanley]], a bluegrass CD, might not sound like much, but the tail is long. Those, with thousands of other products sold each month, would make their seller very happy.<br /><br />My own business is built on a long tail method. The market for Hungarian products is not like the Billboard Top 40. It is like the Billboard Bottom 20,000, if there were such a thing. It works.<br /><br />Anderson's principles can be applied by small businesses like mine, and massive Fortune 500s looking to reach where few are reaching. The markets are there, and, by considering Anderson's ideas, so is the process.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More\\" by Chris Anderson.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
B00005JPS7|5.0|Iron Man is just a flat out fantastic comic book to film adaptation. I had high hopes going in given the amazing critic reviews and I was not let down in any way. Robert Downey Jr. lays down a great performance that easily ranks as one of the best ever in this genre of film. He is funny, smart, cool and just a unique individual. The supporting cast from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jeff Bridges are in fine form as well. The main reason I loved this movie so much was the fact that the cheese factor was very low (more like Batman than the cheese heavy Spiderman), not to mention all the cool tech gadgets. The CGI is only used when needed and looks realistic.<br /><br />My entire sold out theater went crazy throughout the movie and I must admit I even did at times. While The Dark Knight looks to be the film to beat this summer, Iron Man is truly a worthy foe. Now bring on the Iron Man 2!
B00005JPS7|4.0|The Summer season is here and this year it gets an iron boost from finally a new marvel comic franchise hopeful. Having no expectations for Iron Man I was more than surprised with how much I enjoyed it.      This time the Iron Man-to-be, Tony Starks (Robert Downey Jr.), is a weapons manufacturing billionaire, not a nerdy college student. He doesn't need to buy a car to win over his childhood sweetheart, but instead has a super-sized garage with six cars and an assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow) who gets rid of his one night stands. In short, he lives it up in all the luxury one could dream of.      While visiting a US base in Afghanistan to sell more of his weapons, the humvee he is riding is ambushed and he is taken captive by Afghani insurgents. They force him to build them one of his famous bombs, but instead he builds a great big metal suit! A suit which he uses to escape back to America successfully, and once home starts building a better one. Seeing the destruction of his weapons when they fall into the hands of insurgents he wants to shut down his weapons company. This does not go over well with a few people and brings us to a climatic fight between a villain (I will let you be surprised who it is) and Iron Man.      The casting was perfect. Robert Downey Jr. plays his part as the fast-talking, careless billionaire who gets a reality check brilliantly, and Gwyneth Paltrow is immensely entertaining as Pepper Potts, his cool, calculated assistant. Together they have the perfect amount of chemistry that only increases your desire to see Iron Man II.       Iron Man is a strong beginning to what will hopefully, yes I am actually hoping for more, be a successful franchise. Unfortunately with it being a good beginning, is where it faltered, only a little. First you could really tell it was setting up for more as there are actually very few scenes of Iron Man flying around (there are actually many more scenes of Tony building and testing his Iron Man suit) and secondly theend battle was not as spectacular or even intense as most superhero climaxes and ended rather quickly.      Still Iron Man is a strong, very strong film to open the Summer Season, and does not disappoint. The mark of a good film is when, even with a running time of 126 minutes, it leaves you wanting more!
B0010X8NF0|4.0|A lively and interesting comedy. The movie kept your attention all the way through it.
0131479415|5.0|I've read this book because of the \\"Planning\\" in the title. It does cover planning, but not in the depth that I was looking for.<br /><br />It shows a lot of good concept ideas, like prioritizing based on mandatory, linear and exciting features. Or when it talks about using a story as tracer bullet to provide more info to the team. I really like the idea of the theme parking lot.<br /><br />For someone that uses scrum on a daily basis, the idea of creating tasks just before comitting to a story sounds silly, but it makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />The book gets really very good after page 200. It's where most of the \\"planning\\" is.<br /><br />The Case Study on last chapter is really very good.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to everyone interested in agile development, but it's not a introductory book. It's more for the middle practitioner.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|The best part of the movie was the monster, the worst was the wacky camera jumping upppp and downnnn and sidewaaaays endlessly giving me a headache and flashbacks to disco stobe lights.  Unfortunately, the only thing that survives is not the pretty girl or the awesome monster but the stupid camera!!!!
0345479092|5.0|First of all if you are considering purchasing this book for yourself or someone else, ignore the whole breastfeeding issue that some reviewers seem to have.  It is such a small part of the overall book that it seems insignificant to me. I could share my own long story of breastfeeding vs. bottle feeding, but I won't.  It is a choice every parent has to make and should be based on each individuals personal situation and should NOT affect your decision to purchase this book.    Beyond that, I more highly recommend the second book,[[ASIN:0743488946 The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems: Sleeping, Feeding, and Behavior--Beyond the Basics from Infancy Through Toddlerhood]] which gives more insight and helps you to better know what is going wrong when her advice doesn't seem to work.     Then read this book. And, if you can, read them both before the baby arrives - would've saved me many a sleepless night.     If you want to do attachment parenting (i.e. share your bed, feed on demand, and be at the beck and call of your child) then don't bother getting this book - go buy Dr. Sears.  If you want to have some free time, have your child sleep in their own bed and through the night almost every night and (I cannot emphasize this enough) are committed to making something work, then this book is great. The advice is very middle of the road: not letting babies cry it out, but also not advocating you to give them constant attention. (she does not recommend crying it out nor ferberizing)    Tracy's advice and E.A.S.Y routine -( routine is NOT a schedule!!!!) have been immensely helpful for me.  It does take work though, there are no quick fixes or solutions.  Some things take over a week or more of trying, troubleshooting, and tweaking before you resolve issues - like sleeping through the night, napping alone, etc.  But if you are committed this advice works.        Maybe in 18 years I'll write another review to let you know how my kid turned out.  But so far with her methods - my husband and I are so happy to have our lives back and more importantly our sleep!  Plus our baby is so much happier and even-tempered.  We can finally enjoy him.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|By Far the Best Batman to come out since the original with Michael Keaton, Christian Bale plays the role of Bruce Wayne perfectly.  Excellent Movie
B0010358CQ|2.0|This would've made an *excellent* shooter/RPG. The CGI is almost identical to what you see in good video games these days, and the music is on about that level.  The settings would've made for great game battles.  As a movie... well, let me give you the good and the bad:    The Good:  *Getting to see Deunan and Briareos fight as a team.  On their own, they're incredible.  Working together, they're devastating.  These two could take out half an army on their own.    * The fight scenes in general are slick and polished, at times reminiscent of \\"Equilibrium\\" and \\"The Matrix\\".    *The settings:  We're shown a bit more of Olympus, and it's high-tech, without being overwhelming.  Battle sites are appropriately menacing and--what I especially liked--flying debris/shrapnel posed an actual threat to the characters fighting, a degree of realism most anime, CGI, or even live action movies gloss over except when the plot calls for it.    *THe comraderie between the ESWAT members.  You really got the feeling they were a team *and* a dedicated branch of law enforcement.    *Glimpses of the world outside of Olympus.  Where the first movie gave us just a glimpse of the Badlands, here we had references to and characters from Poseidon.    *Bioroids acting like...well, Bioroids, as opposed to escapees from 'The Stepford Wives'.    The Bad    *The changes in voice actors.  I'm with pretty much everyone else on this.   This movie would've been better if they'd kept as much of the old English-speaking cast.  There are many familiar (to anime fans) voices in this movie, but they don't mesh well with memories of previous movies.  I especially missed Jamieson Price as Briareos.    *Changes in character design:  Athena and Nike are recognizeable only by their hair color and name.  Even Deunan's eye color looked different.  Many of the characters looked more like rubbery 'posable dolls', or wax figures.  (Especially that close-up of Deunan at the party.  She reminded me of a Barbie doll.)*The music.  I can't say much about it, as none of it made any kind of impact on me.  It was background noise, nothing more.  It didn't even help set the mood (aside from one awful attempt at choral music at a critical moment that failed badly).    *Failure to develop current plots, much less include anything from before.  The introduction of Tereus looked promising, but they did almost nothing with him.  He looked like and often acted like Briareos, but there was no development beyond a single uncomfortable moment between himself and Deunan in a resturant.  Briareos's later outburst seemed to come out of nowhere, as there'd been no interaction between Deunan and Tereus to warrant it.  (That he'd witnessed, anyway.)  Tereus is supposed to have 'taken a shine' to Deunan, but it wasn't portrayed very well at all.  I saw very little that couldn't be called concerned professionalism.    Tereus himself was lackluster, his sole contribution to the story was that he looked like the original Briareos.  They could have used this opportunity to explore the ethics of the proposed addition to Bioroids to ESWAT, and what problems their emotional inhibitions might bring.  There could have been an opportunity for debate over the ethics of using genetic material from still-living people to create Bioroids.  (And what happened to 'all Bioroids have some of Karl's DNA in them'?)    Even more disappointing, the key element from the second movie, the result of the Appleseed data, is non-existant.  They're still growing Bioroids in vats.  While the changes in the appearance of Olympus could have easily been explained away by the fighting in the previous movie, it then makes no sense to ignore that key plot point.    Instead, we got a weak political plot, an enemy whose motivations made little sense, and a see-through conspiracy.      Overall, I can't call this a bad movie, but it's a better rental than a permanent addition to your collection, unless you are a die-hard Appleseed fan.
B0000085N4|4.0|Already knew product, glad I could find it at all. BOUNUS POINTS!! was in stock.
0312335164|1.0|I picked this up as a holiday read... and boy, what complete junk it is. It fails on pretty much every level. It fails as a thriller because it employs every stupid cliché plot device known to man: the good guy is the bad guy; the senior manager is behind it all; the girl is very clever & beautiful but terrifyingly stupid when it comes to closing doors and hatches. It fails as a technology book because it is so moronically poorly researched. The tech component is about 1% reality and 99% made up junk. Soldering mainframe components under the desk? Snigger....    Frankly, I'd rather be forced to eat this book than ever read it again. Its easy to see why all the books PRIOR to Da Vinci Code were unsuccessful.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This is by far the most I've ever felt gypped after buying a DVD! The director ought to be horsewhipped! Apparently he decided that the premise was SO idiotic that there was no way he could explain why ANYTHING happens - so he doesn't. We never even have a hint about where the monster comes from, what it is, why it's attacking New York, what it's trying to accomplish.... Oh, yes. And why this movie was ever made. Apparently keeping the viewer in the dark PAST the closing credits is considered \\"arty\\" by people trying to substitute that for talent.    And what can I say about the hand-held camera idea? Its spastic motion all over the place (as opposed to pointing it in the direction of something you'd want the viewer to see...) gave me a splitting headache from eyestrain. Other flicks have managed to use the hand-held technique WITHOUT showing us the floor 70% of the time. (Best-ever hand-held: \\"Band of Brothers.\\")    My recommendation: Run away from this, as fast as you can!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|What an amazing score!  If you saw the play - even if it wasn't this \\"original\\" cast, you'll want this CD b/c it is wonderful!!  I've been singing \\"Defying Gravity\\" in my head all day - a must-have!!    :)
B0000TG9E2|4.0|I always considered myself a Disney deprived child because of alot of them I've never seen. So I started buying them now that I'm 22. I came to the realization that I'm glad I waited til I was an adult to see them. Some of them have these freaky scenes and characters that I think would have scared the living daylights out of me when I was a child. For example, the weird disappearing cat and the Queen of Hearts. Jeez!!! Anyway I guess it was okay but the whole mushroom and story line. Almost a weird dream or some kind of trip if you get what I mean.
B000P12LWY|3.0|This series is stylish, hip and sexy, but not for those who are looking for historical accuracy. From the somewhat amusing errors in time period props (ie using the plush regency style sprung coaches instead of the unwieldy tudor style vehicles) to completely abandoning historical reality (such as marrying Henry's sister to the King of Portugal rather than the King of France), the director simply abandons reality whenever it suits his fancy.  However, there is some tour de force acting.  The actresses playing Catherine of Aragon and Anne Bolyen are excellent.  Similarly this series' Cardinal Wolsey sets a benchmark for the role that future actors will have problems measuring up to.  Many of the other actors, however, appear to have wandered in from MTV, still wearing their street makeup in some cases.  All in all, enjoyable, but could have been better researched.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Great CD just hate that it's only 11 songs. But I like majority of them so I would recommend this CD. HOWEVER THE SONG I REALLY LIKE \\"TAKE A BOW\\" IS NOT ON THIS CD. AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS I BOUGHT IT.
B00003CWPL|3.0|...I think this is an effective film, as it apparently sets out to disturb, and it does, in spades. Don't get me wrong, I like weird movies, weird stories, weird music, et cetera, but this is just so nebulous, and Lynch himself has said it is such a personal film, no reviewer, regardless of who they are, will ever accurately sum it up. But it left me with a strange, uncomfortable feeling. It was unpleasant, but I think that was the intent; to have some kind of lingering effect on the viewer. Detractors say it's trash, and nothing but, while fans say it's a masterpiece. To say it's both, sounds like fence-straddling, even though that's what it really is. Both. It's intentionally bad, to the point where any attempts to \\"improve\\" on it, would completely destroy it.<br /><br />So much of this movie just seems so pointless, one wonders why they are sitting through it. It really does seem like a long, terrible dream. But the strangeness of it all is done with such conviction, and the fact that the people involved stayed with it from beginning to end, literally for years, until completion, is commendable. Slow and steady wins the race, as they say.<br /><br />Really, though, how do you hold a film like this up to any standard, when, it being possibly the most bizarre film ever made, has no standard to be measured against? Two recommendations are appropriate to the uninitiated, though: Do not watch this if you are the least bit tired, as the slow pacing and constant rumbling sound in the score, WILL lull you to sleep, however disturbing the images and events on screen are to you. This happened to me, I was tired when I first watched it, and had to scan back to the last part I remembered seeing. The other: if you are a woman expecting a baby, it might not be a good idea to sit through this, which becomes apperent upon viewing. A newborn requires your UNCONDITIONAL love and care, no matter what it is. Pregnancy hormones make a woman a volcano of mood swings, and uh, well...<br /><br />Some things are just too odd to size up, like the woman in the radiator. This is obviously a dream-within-a-dream concept, and she is, despite her pleasant nature, repulsive. Some say frightening; \\"...in Heaven, everything is fine...\\" Does she represent the allure of death? Who knows?<br /><br />The character portrayed by Jack Nance, as the film unfolds, it turns out, is an upstanding man, marrying the woman he impregnated, despite the train-wreck that is her gene pool, and stays with their offspring, but the character in the film I had the most sympathy for, isn't even portrayed by a human being. This newborn \\"baby,\\" is a complete innocent, and doomed to live in this state of being until (spoiler) Henry (Nance) tries to put the poor little creature out of her (his?) misery, and apparently ends his own life..<br /><br />In a nutshell, this film is a sequence of images, events and sounds, which disturb and unhinge. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, and it's not scary enough to be horror. I guess it is a classic \\"Art Film,\\" and the fact that it still gets attention many years later says something.

B0012Q732O|2.0|\\"10,000 BC\\" is a Roland Emmerich film. Check out the list of his films - \\"Independence Day\\" \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" - and you know you need quite a lot of suspension disbelief. But I enjoyed myself watching these films - CGI-created actions and set-pieces and all, and they are often silly, I admit (Will Smith punching the alien in the face?), but it was certainly fun.    Now I have seen his latest film \\"10,000 BC\\" and I find myself sadly disappointed. I don't think the film is as terrible as critics say. At least special effects are top-notch, like the stampede of mammoths or the roaring saber-tooth tiger, but I cannot help thinking something is missing here and despite its first-rate special effects the film is mostly boring.    Perhaps dull characters are to blame. Or maybe the generic story should be responsible. Actions are largely bland despite superb effects. The story follows Steven Strait's self-doubting hero D'Leh whose blue-eyed sweetheart Evolet (Camilla Belle) is kidnapped by the warriors invading his community. Supporting characters are mostly forgettable ciphers and you cannot tell one from another.    But I was willing to forget the weakness of the film's story, which is linear and predictable; I didn't care the actors' accents (or the fact that they speak English). I don't need \\"historical accuracies.\\" But I need something engaging or exciting and that is what I got in \\"Apocalypto\\" (there is a similarity between these films). Unfortunately, you don't get it in \\"10,000 BC.\\" Instead, it borrows from other films, bits from this, bits from that, but gives no original idea, no imagination. The locations such as ice-capped mountains or hot deserts are all beautiful to see, but the problem is, they all look today's New Zealand and Namibia.    I know I shouldn't expect the intensity of the Mel Gibson film, but Roland Emmerich could have done something unique or original to entertain us. Some say, probably rightly, that this is homage to Burroughs-like old-fashioned action adventures. I know, but they have more imagination and original vision, or the will and power to invite us into their fictional worlds, which \\"10,000 BC sorely lacks.
B000056C6U|5.0|In 1978, Paul Weller responded to the dissapointment of the previous \\"Modern World\\" with an album that has defined the Jam<br />and the punk era. Far from the Middle-Class posing of the Clash and their punk cohorts, the Jam remained true andpainted an intimate portrait of English working class life. This album is worth remembering.
B0013A1T8I|3.0|\\"The Golden Compass\\" has everything that would make a great fantasy film - great cast including Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and a fresh talent Dakota Blue Richards, plus great visual effects for which the film went on to win the Oscar. But one sad thing is the film itself doesn't have magic. It lacks a compelling story that would make its audiences willing to share the adventures with the heroine.    The film follows the story of the strong-minded young girl Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) living among Oxford scholars. While her uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) travels to find out the truths of magical particles \\"Dust,\\" Lyra finds herself in the middle of the fierce struggle involving beautiful and commanding Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman). And young Lyra is yet to know that the results of the battles may determine the fate of her world and ours too.     Set in the parallel universe where everyone has his/her own \\"daemons,\\" \\"The Golden Compass\\" centers on Lyra and her long journey to the North. The film has a variety of supporting characters including cowboy aeronaut Lee Scoresby (Sam Shepherd) and great armoured polar bear Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen). Unfortunately, however, we have little time to know these characters. Gorgeous Eva Green appears as green-eyed witch Serafina Pekkala, but she has little to do in the story. And if you blink your eyes, you may miss Christopher Lee.     Sometimes \\"The Golden Compass\\" seems only providing the backgrounds for its subsequent films and has forgotten to tell its own story. Lyra remains attractive, and so is Mrs. Coulter, thanks to the superb performances from Richards and Kidman, but there is no character development. The concept of \\"daemons\\" is not fully developed and though the idea of \\"Alethiometer\\" or the Golden Compass is intriguing, the process of Lyra's decoding it could have been made more so.     \\"The Golden Compass\\" is part of the trilogy written by Philip Pullman. I hear many complaints from the original book's fans who claim the book is much better. Not having read the book, I cannot say anything about it, but maybe director Chris Weitz is trying to please everyone. If so, he shouldn't. Perhaps he should have brought in his own vision and interpretation of Lyra and her journey. \\"The Golden Compass\\" is not a bad film at all. It is slick and entertaining with several impressive battle scenes, but its unique world and story deserve something more than just entertainment.
B000002C25|3.0|This album is proof that Oasis was bound to stumble at some point. Hubris and talent can only carry a band so far. What could've been was reduced to what should've never happened!

B000WE660M|3.0|Giving you a brief rundown of where I stand, I thought \\"Baby One More time\\" and \\"Oops I Did It Again\\" both had some great moments. I thought \\"Britney\\" was her best. And I did enjoy parts of \\"In the Zone.\\" I also enjoyed her \\"Greatest Hits\\" record.<br /><br />This record sounds like it is more for dancing to than listening to. 'Gimme More' was a decent opener. I found 'Piece of Me' annoying. 'Radar' has an interesting 'Bombastic Love' sound. 'Break the Ice' may bring back memories of 'Toxic.' I didn't much care for 'Heaven On Earth' or 'Get Naked.' 'Freak Show' was strange, but it had its charm. I did not care much for 'Toy Soldier.' 'Hot As Ice' had some strange effects, but it was alright. 'Ooh Ooh Baby' may bring back memories of her great song 'Crazy.' 'Perfect Love' also has a 'Toxic' sound. 'Why Should I Be Bad' lacked something.<br /><br />While I would rather listen to \\"Baby One More Time,\\" \\"Oops I Did It Again,\\" \\"Britney,\\" or \\"In the Zone,\\" the truth is even a mediocre record by Ms. Spears is better than none at all.<br /><br />Thank you Ms. Spears for fighting the media's harsh treatment of you, and giving us another record!

0226443213|4.0|When asked about weather related events that incur the deaths of hundreds of people, most think of hurricanes, floods, or large tornado outbreaks.  Few would think that summer heat would bring on the deaths of over 700 people.  Heat, in temperatures as low as 80 degrees Fahrenheit is responsible for more deaths annually than all other weather events combined. As a life-long weather enthusiast, I'd have enjoyed reading more about the atmospheric conditions that brought about the heat wave.  But, that's not the authors intentions.  His focus is on how a large metropolitan area can be brought to it's knees by a sustained heat wave.  It's also largely a story of the \\"have's\\" and the \\"have nots\\".  People in poverty-stricken areas or living on a low or fixed income suffered the most.  Deprived of relief from the heat in any way, some literally suffocated to death in their apartments.  While a heat wave like this is almost an annual occurrence here in Oklahoma, for the residents of Chicago, it was indeed a tragic yet forgotten disaster of historical proportions.
B000VLE3IS|3.0|Love Led Zep.  Favorite band growing up and still think they were the best.  I'm glad we are getting some remastered versions that turned up the volume.  And I like some of the new mastering - especially \\"Immigrant Song\\" where the bass really pops now.  However, \\"Kashmir\\" sounds no different than the 1990 remasters except higher volume.       Only problem I have with MOTHERSHIP is the song selection and shortness of the CDs.  CD1 is 66:18 and CD2 is 69:21.  So we have about 20-22 more minutes that could have been used.  Absolute musts for these 20 minutes should have been  \\"The Ocean\\" (4:30) from HOH, \\"Gallows Pole\\" (4:55) from III, \\"Battle of Evermore\\" (5:49) from IV, and \\"The Wanton Song\\" (4:06) from PG.    Then I have to wonder why so many of these Led Zep hits collections continue to include the 10 minute \\"Achilles Last Stand\\", the 7 minute \\"No Quarter\\", \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" (5:39) and \\"D'yer Maker (4:23).  These songs are just not that good - they have parts that are OK but in total they are tedious and boring, or with the latter, just silly.  But I understand that \\"No Quarter\\" is considered a classic so I guess leave that on even though it is mostly slow, quiet and boring.  But taking out the other 3 frees up 21 more minutes.  Better songs to fill that gap could be \\"Living Loving Maid\\" (2:39) and \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" (4:43) from II, the superb \\"The Rover\\" (5:35) and the short instrumental classic \\"Bron-Y-Aur\\" (2:06) from PG, and \\"Fool In The Rain\\" (6:12) from In Through the Out Door.    But by far the biggest omission on MOTHERSHIP is \\"The Ocean.\\"  This song has one of the best opening riffs that Led Zep did and it would have been great to hear this in the new re-mastered sound.  How this was left off is beyond me.    The programming I would have done is as follows:  CD1 (TOTAL TIME ~ 77:10)  1. Good Times Bad Times (2:47) from I  2. Communication Breakdown (2:28) from I  3. Dazed and Confused (6:28) from I  4. Babe I'm Gonna Leave You (6:41) from I  5. Whole Lotta Love (5:32) from II  6. Ramble On (4:22) from II  7. Heartbreaker (4:15) from II  8. Livin Lovin Maid (2:39) from II  9. What Is and What Should Never Be (4:43) from II  10.Immigrant Song (2:26) from III  11.Gallows Pole (4:55) from III  12.Since I've Been Loving You (7:23) from III  13.Black Dog (4:54) from IV  14.Rock and Roll (3:41) from IV  15.Battle of Evermore (5:49) from IV  16.Stairway to Heaven (8:02) from IV    CD2 (TOTAL TIME ~ 78:30)    1. When the Levee Breaks (7:10) from IV  2. The Song Remains the Same (5:32) from HOH  3. Over the Hills and Far Away (4:49) from HOH  4. The Ocean (4:30) from HOH  5. No Quarter (7:00) from HOH  6. House of the Holy (4:04) from PG  7. The Wanton Song (4:06) from PG  8. The Rover (5:35) from PG  9. Bron-Y-Aur (2:06) from PG  10.Kashmir (8:29) from PG  11.Nobody's Fault But Mine (6:16) from Presence  12.In the Evening (6:51) from ITTOD  13.Fool In The Rain (6:12) from ITTOD  14.All My Love (5:50) from ITTOD    I have made a 2CD set like this, although I don't really care for Led Zep's extended blues song \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" and I've already dissed \\"No Quarter\\" so I replaced these two 7 minute songs with \\"Black Mountain Side\\" (from I), \\"Friends\\" (from III) and \\"Custard Pie\\" and \\"Black Country Woman\\" (from PG).  I also think \\"In the Light\\" from PG is a great song if only they would edit out the the meandering synthesizer in the first 2 minutes - similar to how \\"In the Evening\\" begins.
B00006JMQG|5.0|Made at the height of the German Expressionist movement, Caligari is a true classic and a magnificent gem.  As a silent film fanatic, this film is on par with other greats such as Nosferatu and the REAL Phantom Of The Opera with Lon Chaney.  Kino has done a great restoration job on this piece and I highly recommend this version over many other low-budget restorations I've seen over the years.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|I was so excited to get this CD that I went off on the manager in Circuit City beacuse they didn't have it on display and I had to wait for them to get it out the back room.  Needless to say now that it should have been left in the back room in a vault never to see light again.  It pains me to say this because Erykah is (or was) my favorite artist.  Her performance here in Atlanta shortly after Worldwide Underground was the best concert ever.  But this CD.  Man I can't get through it.  I feel lost listening to all the rambles, and I hate the repition.  I will now have to screen upcoming records from Erykah.  Why Erykah? Why?
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I bought this cd/dvd by Muse because they are one of my favorite bands and sadly I have never had the opportunity to see them live.  When I put in the dvd I was immediately blown away by their performance.  These three guys really know how to make good music and their live act is just as good if not better than their cds.  This is one purchase you will not regret!
B000OCZD5G|4.0|I have always been a fan of the Mad Max series and I was very excited to hear of The Road Warrior on Blu-Ray. Excellent movie and you really see the difference on BR, it only lacked more extra features. But, overall a must buy!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I have had no trouble whatsoever with this device. I am slowly loosing my eyesight so it is very handy to just sit back and extend the arm and display right up to my face and go to work. I am going to buy another one so as to use two displays at once. I work with images all day so I need several windows open at the same time. I will be able to view more items at the same time and hopefully save some time switching between windows.
1416550518|4.0|The whole time I was reading this I could only think about how much it reminded me of The Thirteenth Tale.<br /><br />The story is mostly told through the eyes of 14 year old Grace Reeves who has taken a position with her mother's former employer at Riverton House in 1914.  Grace begins in the kitchen and is able to view the family from this unseen position.  When she enters the house, she is the same age the two young girls, though virtually invisible to them, but yet turns into their confidant.  And within time, rises to the unfathomable position of ladies maid to Hannah.<br /><br />But things become quite topsy-turvy when at the age of 98 Grace is approached by a movie producer and is asked to be a kind of consultant for a movie about the lives of Hannah and Emmeline.  As all the memories begin to flood back, Grace begins her own telling of the tale that reveals her secrets, plus the truth as to what really happened the night that a family friend and poet Robbie Hunter died in the summer house.<br /><br />The truths and lies are revealed slowly and sometimes quite subtly.  A few, \\"oh, now I get it\\" moments and a couple of \\"could they be that naïve\\" moments, but over all an appealing read.  I just wish that it wouldn't have been so drawn out.  Quite slow moving in some places and then suddenly it's over.  The ending is very good, and makes up for the other slower parts.  Just wish that it could have maintained a more even flow.
1883217040|5.0|This is an excellent book but not for beginners. I've been playing bass for over 20 years and found useful information right on the first chapters. I had two years of piano lessons and I'm having a tough time trying to play some of the more complex examples. You must be able to read treble clef and play some piano to take advantage of the material. I found this is a University level course, not your \\"Learn to solo in 24h\\" kind of book. I had to get a teacher to help me through this book. Definitely recommend.
B00139W3NE|4.0|Not being one who seeks out the seemingly endless line of Harry Potter/Narnia/Lord of the Rings tropes (a little computer generated monster realm goes a long way), THE GOLDEN COMPASS  came somewhat as a pleasant surprise.  Yes, this is still a fantasy film, but the emphasis is more on stylish creation of various animals (in the forms of 'daemons' that accompany children as their souls, morphing into various animal life at will) than tiresome explosions and flying beasties.<br /><br />Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is clearly the star of this adventure that explores the possibility of other, parallel worlds whose interaction with the world as we know it is controlled by various groups of good guys and bad guys, all seeking the source of secrecy contained in a Golden Compass that can only be read by a single girl - Lyra, a poor child living in the presence of scholars.  Lyra's uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) places the Golden Compass in Lyra's knowing hands and heads off to the far North to investigate the element that binds all life together - Dust. The tale is set in motion by the enigmatic Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) who gains Lyra's confidence and offers to take her to the great North.  All manner of adventures occur on the journey - friends of Lyra's  are threatened to be separated from their various daemons in the cruel hands of the bad guys, Lyra's encounter with a witch Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green), her assistance from a friendly astronaut (Sam Elliott) and an armored bear - and with all fantasies, good prevails - or does it?  Tune in for the very obvious next installment.<br /><br />The pleasures are many, not the least of which are the voices and changing forms of the little animal daemons.  The cast is excellent and the whole movie sails with yet another beautiful musical score by Alexandre Desplat. It is a nice diversion, but you have to love fantasy.  Grady Harp, May 08
1594489505|5.0|I could not put this book down!  The relationship between the two women is beautifully written.  The tragic story is outweighed by the optimistic spirit.  This was more than a good book.  It is an instant classic that should be cherished for decades.  I'm so thankful I took the time to read A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B00006399Z|2.0|Traffic was one of the most interesting and tasteful bands of the late 1960's and early 1970's. But this recording makes it clear just how limited they were live, due to an interesting problem: The wonderful Steve Winwood was their best singer, keyboard player  guitar player and even their best bass player. In the studio, he could do all of these things on the same track, and even double up on piano and Hammond B3 organ. But live, he could only play one instrument and sing.<br /><br />So even when, as on this recording from 1971, he was reunited with erstwhile bandmate Dave Mason, who was a big contributor to Traffic's first two great albums from 1967-68, the results are most disappointing. Where are the tasty piano fills? Or the searing lead guitar on Mr. Fantasy? Missing. Winwood is playing other parts. Mason is not up the lead guitar role. And the recording quality is  very poor, barely acceptable for even a bootleg. The bass frequencies are 99% missing. No lower octaves, no bass drum. Even for 1971, this is way below standards.<br /><br />So, if you haven't heard \\"Traffic\\" from 1968, or \\"John Barleycorn\\" from 1970, or \\"Low Spark\\" from 1972, go buy them right now. These are three fo the greatest albums of their era. The first has more range, due to Mason's songwriting contributions on top of Winwoods usual greatness, and the later two feature Winwood at his very finest. But skip this poor release. It truly sounds like the obligatory contract fulfiller that other reviewers say it was. A real throwaway effort. I feel that my fellow reviewers have caused me to waste money looking-in vain- for a hidden gem I somehow missed.<br /><br />Great band, bad album.
B0014KD46W|4.0|Excellent return to form from Steve W. Totally enjoyed this album thanks to a rootsier approach. May sound a little low-fi (hence the charm) but the songs reward repeated play. The man's aged well and his voice and organ playing are as winsome as ever. Fans won't be disappointed.
B000002J6F|4.0|Stephen Stills was a true musical superstar in his unfortunately short prime, and while his greatness with the Buffalo Springfield and of course Crosby, Still and Nash have been widely heard and widely recognized, this 1972 effort was overlooked by a lot of people. Including this reviewer; I was a huge Stills fan at the time, but until last month had never heard this interesting and cohesive album fronted by Stills.     As other reviewers clearly indicate, there are few if any excellent and truly memorable song selections, in terms of song writing. \\"Johnny's Garden\\" is a very good and really catchy one. And most of the others are hummable, servicable \\"Americana\\" style tunes. But there are just not many individual standout songs. Still, you can hear that Manassas was clearly a great band;the Byrd's Chris Hillman is a fine second singer and guitarist, and the players are all talented pros, especially Al Perkins on pedal steel.      Most of all you get to hear a young Stephen Still sing his heart out and play all those amazing accoustic and electric guitar parts. Nobody has ever gotten all those brilliant sounds out of a Martin 6 string like he did, and here is some of the best acoustic playing he ever put on record. So if you love that wonderful, intelligently executed rock that is countryish but is not country, \\"roots\\" sound that Still was a master of, and you wonder why he rarely sounded as good as he did on \\"BlueBird\\" \\"Suite Judy Blue Eyes\\" \\"Questions\\" \\"Woodstock\\", Wooden Ships\\", then buy this because he sounds just as wonderful on Manassas. And the band really cooks, and the overall feel of the twenty or so songs is really lively and most cohesive.    Aching to give it five stars, but the tunes are just not that memorable. Even so, if this were vinyl, I would have worn it out in [past six weeks. It's a tight,talented band fronted by a true musical genius. I was most pleased to have finally heard, after all these years, a lesser-recognized gem.
0375714839|5.0|Without harping too much on what has already been said about the political observations that Satrapi makes or her commentary on the limits faced by everyone (and most especially) women in Iran, the truly inspirational achievement of this work is how honest she can be about herself in the story. That with everything whirling around her, the fact that she can be honest about both the good and the bad of the relationships she'd been in, the despair both at home and abroad, the flickers of hope that she clung to during the darkest times and how (true to the reality of a hopeful young woman) the very worst thing that can happen is ultimately to let down yourself and to let down your loved ones is stark and amazing. The scene where she loses the trust and the good standing with her grand mother is heart-breaking and yet could happen to any teenage girl anywhere in the world. That it's depicted in basic drawings doesn't detract from the power of the moment in the least.<br /><br />And not that graphic novels these days have any trouble being seen as legitimate art, but Persepolis certainly puts a nail in the coffin of the arguments made by detractors.<br /><br />Trust this book for it's emotion, for it's personal honesty, for it's attempts to always find something good even under the most extreme circumstances. It is not a history book. It is a personal history book. And it is one that deserves applause.

1416914293|3.0|Less derivative than CITY OF BONES, this sequel suffers from the same purple prose problems, characterisation is sometimes patchy and the internal logic creaks.      Clare works harder to make the material here her own.  Valentine is less cliched as a villain, with Clare doing a decent job at showing someone so utterly convinced that he is right that he can't even begin to think that he might be wrong and I could just buy into his being willing to use demons to further those ends.  Unfortunately the Inquisitor feels like a rehash of `old' Valentine, a single-minded Shadowhunter who holds Jace responsible for the sins of his father and refuses to listen to any views different to her own.    Jace will appeal to teenagers - moody, handsome and with hints at special powers.  His dialogue sometimes doesn't fit his age, but his scenes are confidently handled.  I wish I could say the same for Clary.  She remains passive and reactive and her own special powers take her too close to Mary-Sue territory.  The incestuous feelings between Clary and Jace are the main theme in the book but the subject's handled in a shallow manner as neither character seems interested in the consequences or emotional implications of their feelings and Clare drops anvils as to its resolution, which robs the love triangle between Clary, Jace and Simon of tension.    Simon suffers a great deal in this book and it's a shame that Clare does not set out the scene where he's forced into a terrifying transformation.  There have been hints of this since the first book but the main catalyst here happens off page and without any real build-up, which is frustrating as it robs the book of some real drama and shock-value.  The dilemma that this transformation causes for Simon is resolved by the end of the book in a way that's too pat and I think it's a missed opportunity.      The prose is purple and repetitive at times and sometimes stunts the action.  There are some inner-story logic problems, notably where Jace visits Valentine, finding him easily even though he's managed to evade all of the other Shadowhunters.  Best scenes in the book are a dream sequence between Clary and her mother and Valentine's attack on the Silent Brothers.   The cliffhanger ending is a cheap device but will leave fans panting for the concluding volume.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This CD is to be savored bit by bit, and beat by beat. It's not like CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR that you fall in love at 1st sight (listening). No, this is an album you have to explore, listen, pay attention, get to know...and when you see, you are addicted to its flavor, like a sugarholic!  It's FUN and upbeat, Modern and Retro, light and hard, involving and hipnotic. Madonna did a great job with the TRIO (TIMbaland, TIMberlake and Pharrel) and other artists that collaborated in this work. It's good to see that Madonna changes her style, but doesn't change her taste, which is an excelent one. She has experience and talent. That's why she's been here that long.   Buy it, and listen to it without prejudice. At the end, you will be in love.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|They did a good job of cleaning up unresolved Ori issues in this 2 hour format.  The production was better than TV.  The writing was the same as TV.  I enjoyed it.  My only criticism would be that they should have stayed with the Ori story line instead of throwing replicators into the mix.  It seemed like too much was going on at once.  They could have saved replicators for another movie.  I would also have liked O'Neill to be in it, but he wasn't.  I think this should be priced in the $10-$12 range.  $14-$17 seems high to me.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I've been a die hard fan of Madonna since DAY ONE.  Unfortunately, this CD is worst than Gwen's second album, on a really bad day.  Superficial, shallow and BUBBLE GUM.  Speaking of Candy.  The lyrics are so bad, I think her daughter wrote them for her... or maybe she should have.
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|Everybody seems to have gotten excited about the guitars, but lyrically, this band is pretty confused and seems to have lost the ability to write coherent songs.    Michael's voice sounds fine but for the most part, the lyrics and melodies are either forgettable or simply \\"moon/June/spoon.\\"      Because the band has struggled so much since Berry left, I think the secret is out that he WAS the band, otherwise they would have carried on from heights to heights.    At only 35 minutes, this short CD is best purchased used (as I did) and we can only wait for the next R.E.M.-- maybe Berry will return and help with the songwriting?
1591841992|5.0|This book helps you to get out of your logic box and think creatively. I enjoyed reading every page. Author is truthful about his real experiences with briefing executives. This book encapsulates a lot of important principles and techniques that have been around for at least 20 or so years. The cool thing is it is easy to read and doesn't take very long to read, and the reader can get a lot out of applying the visual principles highlighted in the book.
0756404746|5.0|Wow. I have been searching for the past several years for a fantasy title that would grab me as thoroughly as some of the novels I had read in my youth. Sure, The Song of Ice and Fire is good. Really d*%n good. But I don't sit around cursing because the next title is not due out until.... 9/30/08, (promises, promises). The last series I read with such abandon was The Belgariad by David Eddings. And I've been looking for something else as good ever since.<br /><br />The framework of The Kingkiller Chronicle is that of a story told by the man who lived it, which works so very perfectly for the fantasy genre. And Pat Rothfus embellishes his tale with just the right amount of humor and action. The characters seem like old friends. Mysteries abound as the story unfolds until finally... alas, we must wait for April 09.<br /><br />If you are a fantasy fan, or know one, pick up this book. Pass it on to your friends and relations. You will not be disappointed. Myself, I have appointed Pat Rothfuss as my personal Writing Deity.
B0018CAAN6|1.0|I have been a Madonna fan from the begining and I have to say this is the worst CD shes ever put out! Is it bad? Not really, Is it anything Original, NOT AT ALL?!?! It's like she taken the best tracks from Justin Tumberlakes CD's and added her own words over his old tracks...It is just sad that Madonna has always been \\"original\\" And brought so many new sounds to ever CD shes ever put out...But this one is 100% sellout, Its sad that she would settle to do this, just to \\"get back on top?!?!?\\" I guess all she really cares about is selling more CD's and trying to catch Mariah with #1's???

B00005JPS7|5.0|Iron Man is simply one of the best. Forget the sorry excuses for movies that were Spider Man 3, or The Fantastic Four, forget all that nonsense. Iron Man stands with the best, a true revival for the super hero genera on par with the great super hero movies such as Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins. What a way to kick off the summer season that will also see long awaited films such as the new Indiana Jones movie, the second Batman film The Dark Night, and the redo of The Incredible Hulk.<br /><br />The film starts off with billionaire/genius weapons developer Tony Stark riding in the back of a Humvee in the Afghan desert, havening successfully impressed the military by blowing up a whole mountain with his new Jericho Missile. From the start of this film Tony is one of the MOST likable guys to ever grace the big screen. He's charming, smart, witty, funny, hardcore, and a bit of a ladies man. One memorable scene was when a girl Toney was with woke up in his house alone and found his personal assistance, Pepper Pots, with her dry-cleaning.<br />\\"Ten years and he still has you doing his dry cleaning?\\"<br />\\"I do anything he requires of me,\\" Potts replies, \\"even, occasionally, taking out the trash.\\"<br />As he eloquently puts it; \\"They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire, well I respectfully disagree. I prefer the one you only have to fire once. That's how America does it, that's how my dad did it, and it's worked out pretty well so far.\\" Now tell me you wouldn't like to hang out with THAT guy.<br /><br />Unfortunately for our hero the Humvee he's riding comes under fire from Afghan rebels and he is taken hostage and forced to build one of his new weapons for his captures (after refusing of course and getting water boarded). But he has a few tricks up his sleeves and manages to escape by building, you guest it, an Iron Man.<br /><br />Far and away the best thing this movie accomplishes is creating likable characters who may not be as relatable as, say, Peter Parker, but who are definitely just as cool or sympathetic. As stated before, Tony Stark is the very definition of cool, but he isn't the only character who steals the show. His lady friend, oddly named Pepper Potts (okay, who was the genius who decided to name her Pepper Potts?) is perfect in her role as personal assistant/love interest with all her witty dialog and charm. The Afghan man Tony meets while in captivity is also a great contrast to Starks cocky and care free attitude; plus their conversations with one another are some of the best you'll see in a super hero movie, period.<br /><br />The only problem I had, and it's a small one, is that the action in this film was a little lacking. The escape from Afghanistan in the first Iran Man was great, and the battle between Iron Man and the Afghan militia later on was also incredible, but when it came to Iron Man VS really big Iron Man, the outcome was somewhat of a disappointment; the reason being that we never got to see both fighting at their best. One was always at a disadvantage during the whole fight. To see both go at it at their best would have been nothing short of amazing, unfortunately though we never got to see that.<br /><br />If you're a super hero movie fan then you HAVE to see this flick. Iron Man stands proud with the best in its genera and simply blows out of the water most badly made adoptions. Oh, and one more thing, if your willing to wait ten minutes for the credits to finish there is a thirty second scene at the end that may be worth seeing as it sets the stage for a sequel pretty well.<br /><br />Re-watch Value; VERY high.just as cool or sympathetic.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I'm always amazed with the bad reviews, in how they really stem from the same kind of listener -- someone who wants a rehash of what's already been done before.  This album is truly thrilling and gets better with every listen.  Very rich instrumentation.  I've loved Portishead from the start.  This is a great comeback because it really adds to their legacy.  Get it only if you like to be surprised.  Give it a chance and you will ultimately be thrilled by this true trip experience of an album.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I can hardly wait to own these DVDs! I've watched the HBO series over and over and see or hear something every time that I missed in previous viewings. This series is rich in historical detail, drama, and humor. I can't vouch for the historical accuracy, but I have great respect for David McCullough, on whose book the series is based, and trust that he and the series are true to the...well, the truth.  I am grateful to Tom Hanks for his vision and tenacity in bringing these stories to us in such a pleasurable way. Now, how about the Thomas Jefferson story in a similar fashion?
B00005NKKV|5.0|This is one of the all-time best albums, and one of my all-time favorites (there IS a difference!).  This re-release is excellent for the inclusion of a couple of extra tracks.  Great stuff.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|I was hugely looking forward to this series but ended up a little disappointed. The concept is great, most of the story ideas also were (well, not all), but there are lots of shortcomings. The acting is at times downright bad (especially the actor playing Owen), the plots are about as full of holes as Swiss cheese, and most action scenes look downright silly. Still, the series has its moments, and the slow, more reflective episodes really shine; the highlight certainly being \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\". I just hope that season 2 picks up where this season leaves off. I will, despite my misgivings, be back to watch it.
0938045695|1.0|Pavel's physical fitness aside, most of his books or videos are full of fluff and empty information, some of which can be useful and could be condensed into maybe 10 pages or 5 minutes of video. This particular title was very basic, with lots of filler and advertisement for his other products.   If you want decent kettle bell (which are not Russian, by the way!) exercises, look for Steve Maxwell's videos, save your money and stay away from Dragon Door's marketing gurus.

B00006830P|5.0|This is an excellent collection, capturing many of the best Dylan tunes.  However, for some reason I think Disc 2 is much better than Disc 1...I'm not sure why, but that's the one I tend to track to most often (between the 2).
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|How late!  Worst Madonna album ever.  Motherhood and changed this star and it shows.  This is her sell-out album.  Damn Girl, you need the money that bad?  Kate Bush's last album sucked too.  Thank God us 40-50 somethings still have Annie Lennox pumping out great tunes.
B0010V4TZU|3.0|As much as I love this band's originality, with scores of harpsichords, organs and violins, the debut release of Vampire Weekend is somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />The album starts unspectacularly, with some weird disco/techno groove. As much as I love the orchestration, I spent most of the time wishing that there was a louder bass line.<br /><br />In fact, there is almost no bass in the opening songs until the third track, \\"A-Punk.\\" Even then, I'm still wishing that there was some sort of cool guitar solo to make up for the bass line. Even The White Stripes knew to add some wacky keyboard solos or guitar feedback to jazz up their bare-bones recordings.<br /><br />\\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" might have sounded good in the 70s or 80s, in the time of the Talking Heads. However, it still sounds a little too primitive for my tastes. And it doesn't help that there is a nearly non-existant bass line.<br /><br />And these opening songs make the album disappointing, unfortunately. They show some brilliant orchestration in the songs \\"M79\\" and \\"I Stand Corrected.\\" And I really liked the cute harpsichord touches in \\"One (Blake's Got a New Face)\\", with cool vocals that might have come from an album by The Police, shot by machine-gun speed guitar strums afterwards.<br /><br />As much as I love Vampire Weekend, I wasn't too impressed with this release. Amazon may have said that this is an improvement on the Talking Heads album, \\"Remain in Light\\", but I highly doubt it.
B00154GEFU|5.0|Wetton's recent brush with death and bypass surgery have obviously given him something meaningful to write about, and the emotion shines through; he's never sounded better.  Howe is playing with much more fire than on the past few Yes tours, and really came up with some beautiful compositions on this album.   Downes sounds great as always, and while Palmer's playing is top-notch, I miss the more punchy production sounds his drums (and Wetton's Zon bass) had on their 80's albums.      Just great music, folks.  My fave track is Extraordinary Life, which helped get my wife and I through some tough times with our daughter's health over the past couple of weeks.  Looking for some catchy, uplifting, secular music?  This is the disc for you.  A perfect blend of pop and prog.  GREAT JOB GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!   Can't wait to see you in Cleveland!!

0061245097|5.0|When I found Halfway to the Grave I was enthralled by the characters and as soon as I finished I could not wait for the sequel. Much to my dismay it would not come out until months later. But let me tell you it was worth the wait. One Foot in the Grave picks up 4 years later after Halfway to the Grave and we get to see how Cat has tried to move on. We see as she tries to forget about Bones and as soon as she realizes she can't look who shows up. Lots a twist happen but Cat finally starts fighting for what she wants. I loved this book and I am back in the boat I was in before. Now I have to wait more months for the next one and I hope it is just as good as the ones before it.

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|One of her best Albums, hey what can I say, bought it the day it came out and almost 8 months later it's an album that I still listen to on a weekly basis.  I'll get many years of enjoyment out of this album.  Creative!  Thanx Annie.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|It's undisputed that the White Stripes are one of the best rock bands of all time. Although I might need some time to think about where to place them in my list of favorite bands, this album proves that they rank pretty high on the Richter scale.<br /><br />\\"Icky Thump\\" is an earthquake-shaker of an album, starting off with a title track with slamming guitar chords, Meg White's loud cymbals and an angular guitar solo acting as the chorus. The solo is followed by a schizophrenic keyboard solo that adds much more excitement to a spectacular start.<br /><br />And the excitement never ceases. Jack White literally turns into a wannabe-Spanish tenor, with his cry on the epic \\"Conquest\\". Who would have thought that Jack would go so far with his loud songs?<br /><br />Another original twist comes in the form of bagpipes. \\"Prickly Thorn\\" starts as a folk-song, complete with clapping. However, it changes gears in a psychedelic bagpipe melody, mixed with strange quotes and laughs.<br /><br />And it still features awesome exploding songs, such as \\"Little Cream Soda\\". Although I have heard Jack White give odd monologues alongside loud guitar blasts, his coolest one yet came in this song. He spends time reminiscing about times when he wanted his ice cream soda a little colder, passing it off by saying \\"oh well.\\"<br /><br />I'd have to say that Jack White is starting to develop quite an ego, though. With \\"Rag and Bone,\\" Jack literally brags that \\"If it's just things that you don't want, I can use 'em/Meg can use 'em/Make some money out of 'em, at least\\". Still, I'd have to say that Jack White has every reason to brag--they're the hottest band out in America right now, and still as explosive as they were when they began.<br /><br />But still, back to rocking. In fact, \\"Catch Hell Blues\\" shows off Jack's wacky slide guitar effects. I love how inventive Jack is with high-pitched guitar squeals. I missed these squeals from bands such as \\"Rage Against the Machine,\\" and I'm glad White has made the squeals cool again (thank goodness!).<br /><br />And finally, Jack has never sounded so soulful as in the last jam, \\"Effect and Cause\\". There's nothing better than a simple acoustic guitar song, with excellent protest lyrics such as \\"Well you can't take the effect/And make it the cause/I didn't rob a bank/Cos you made up the law\\".<br /><br />This is, to date, The White Stripes' explosion album that shows them off at their best. There's so much original materal, so many awesome sound effects and so much protest angst that I couldn't give this album any less than my highest recommendation. Go get it if you're a rock fan. You won't regret it..    And finally, Jack has never sounded so soulful as in the last jam, \\"Effect and Cause\\".

B000000Y87|5.0|Recorded in June, 1961 this album set at that time the standard for the piano-bass-drums jazz trio - a standard that has still not been surpassed. It is essential to any collection of jazz, or music for that matter.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|It was a decent story but the handheld camera sucked. If I would have to see it again I would not. Once is enough.
B000002C1W|4.0|I'm not going to lie and say that I like this better than Dark Side of the Moon, Wish you Were Here, Animals, The wall, or The Division Bell.  This album, however, is very good.  It is missing Waters as a lyrcist, which is to bad, however Gilmour and Wright do a fairly good job writing the music.  This album is somewhat a precursor to the better album, Division Bell.  This CD is very good.
B00000IQBN|4.0|I have always loved the writings of William Makepeace Thackeray, especially when I am not in a hurry to be rushed through a novel.  I had never watched the film by Stanley Kubrick until this morning, and I had a lot of mixed feelings about it.  Kubrick wrote the screenplay, and it is definitely not the Thackeray novel, especially when it comes to character intent, several plotlines and even the viewpoint, as the novel is first person; so this is Thackeray ala Kubrick first off, and that's okay. Kubrick's take on Barry Lyndon, though, left me very chilled and detached from the character, unlike the book....and Ryan O'Neal's portrayal did nothing but pull me further away.    The film is so beautifully photographed and the set design so amazing, that I was able to endure the 183 minutes of constant brooding looks by Ryan O'Neal as Barry Lyndon.  The film seemed ponderously unbearable at times, because the scenes are so long and drawn out.  The novel is complex, so I can't understand why Kubrick changed it and made it even more so.  For me, personally, I wanted to stop and give up on this film, because the story line is dragged out ad nauseum, and quite honesty, I could not abide Ryan O'Neal's portrayal.  It is pretty tough to watch a film where I feel the lead actor is THAT awful; but, when a film's look and feel is so beautiful, I can overlook some things. I am glad I watched it.  It is memorable, but editing would have been the better piece of valor IMO. Thank Kubrick that he included an Intermission.  I ate and .....well you know!
B000W4KT64|4.0|This is a good movie, even if you aren't a fan of musicals. It has a good message, but I think it is a little slow in the middle of the moive.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I'm so glad I got this CD. The first track, \\"Let's Pretend\\" is played on our local alternative station quite a lot and I love it. Techno-mix with some Beatles influence, MGMT is full of fun tracks that are great to drive to, work out with or just have on during a party. I played it on my laptop on windows media and was treated to a fun pop display of images.   CD comes with hand-written lyrics, interactive video, a tour photo album and scenes from \\"Time To Pretend\\" video shoot. Great buy!

B000NA2776|5.0|I literally discovered Mika a week ago through a friend and instantly became a fan! My taste in music up to this point was rock from the 60's and 70's but lately I've been branching out and Mika is my new favorite.    When I first listened to Grace Kelly, my first thought was \\"Freddie Mercury?\\" but as I listened on I realized that Mika had a whole different vocal range and he delves into places that other musicians hadn't gone into before.    Hopefully Mika will come to the U.S. for his next tour!
B00127RAJY|5.0|First I'd like to say how much I love this video and from the first wokout, I knew I was doing something good for my body. My legs were shaking by the end and they were sore for the next two days.<br />I've been working out for many years and one of the \\"rules\\" of working out is, when you're lifting weights, you need to give the muscles you've worked a day of rest in order for them to recouperate and grow. Increases in muscle size and strength don't occur while you're training, they occur during the rest period between workouts. This is when your muscles recover and rebuild, gradually becoming bigger and stronger. The recovery process takes at least 48 hours. For this reason, strength training sessions should be scheduled no more frequently than every other day. If you prefer to train more often, you should avoid hitting the same muscle group on consecutive days. This means you must rest long enough to allow for recovery of the targeted muscle group, the nervous system, refill glycogen stores (Energy stored within your muscles), and also allow enough time for the muscles to make improvements or increases. This process takes time. Generally, it takes between 2-7 days to recover from a strength workout! The harder you work the longer it takes your body to repair. Don't short-circuit your progress by strength training too often!<br /><br />This workout simultaneously works your upper and lower body, which is why I do it every other day, rather than every day. I just feel that on the off days, doing some sort of cardio is the way to go. Jillian doesn't really specify in the video whether to do this daily or every other day.

B0000C5RQF|5.0|Another Magic Flute?  So, what makes this one different--why should you bother with it?<br /><br />Diana Damrau is the prettiest Queen of the Night that I've ever seen--and she can sing--oh, can she sing.  She sings those famous Queen arias a tad slower than many have done, and she sings so clearly you can make out every word.  Her performance--her singing, outstanding acting, great costume, and unworldly beauty are reason alone for seeing this Flute.<br /><br />But there's much more.  Will Hartmann as Tamino has a gorgeous voice, and can I say it:  he is manlier than most Taminos.  A perfect match for him is the lovely Dorothea Roschmann, a voluptuous Pamina who acts convincingly and sings with an elegant voice that Mozart would relish.<br /><br />Simon Keenlyside is a real Papageno with all the cages, tricks, and simple attraction that makes a Papageno that we all love.  Sarastro is sung by Franz Josef Selig whose rich bass reminded me at times of Kurt Moll.<br /><br />The costumes are beautiful, yet not distracting.  The hairstyles seemed a bit strange at first, but I think they contribute to the otherworldliness that Mozart was creating here.<br /><br />It's sung in German, with English and Spanish subtitles.<br />The Bonus includes a slide show synopsis of the opera--this would be useful to explaining the storyline to newcomers.<br />The Bonus also includes a photo gallery of the cast, and interviews with director David McVicar and conductor Colin Davis who explains what the genius of Mozart means to him.<br /><br />I saw only the DVD released in 2003, but the Blu-Ray edition should be worth seeing, as the costumes, scenery, close-ups and singing and acting are worth seeing at their best.

B000002KCV|5.0|Having recently purchased the DVD \\" Heart of Gold \\"  I wanted something that had my favorite songs off that DVD on a CD.  \\" Comes a Time \\" was it, and I was surprised how fast the delivery was, even out here in Australia.  The title song is perhaps my favorite Neil Young number, and I play the CD all the time now.  It's great to be able to listen to some great music, and especially with a great backing vocalist in Nicolette Larson.  I'm one very satisfied customer.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Great CD!  I'm a huge Madonna fan and though I loved her cover song w/Justin, I was worried about the upcoming album...with the notion of \\"hip hop\\"; I am not a fan of hip hop.  Yes, a little hip hop thrown in but it's mild with some voice synthesizing, like in her few latest CD's.  \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"4 Minutes\\", \\"Give It 2 Me\\", \\"Heartbeat\\", \\"Miles Away\\" (she is on acoustic guitar); \\"Incredible\\" are my favorites on the disc so far.  \\"Drowned\\" was a huge comeback success album, \\"American Life\\" not so much, but the songs that didn't become popular from that CD were better than those that did become popular...I'm sure any fan would agree.  \\"Confessions\\" was a much better hit for her.....\\"Hard Candy\\" is just as great.  Like another reviewer speculated, Madonna just goes with the times....as does her fans.  Is there anyone else her age who can pull out all the stops?!  All in all, it's a great CD...I look forward to her upcoming concert and any future endeavors.

0743270754|5.0|With great writing and fabulous storytelling, Goodwin takes us deep into the inner workings of President Abraham Lincoln's cabinet during the Civil War and into the minds and lives of the key players. This is not another Lincoln biography or a history about the Civil War battles or generals, although we do meet and get a greater appreciation of the good and bad generals -- Grant and Sherman vs. McClellan -- and focus on Lincoln's leadership skills and style. In some ways, you could say this extremely engaging read is a biography of a particular institution -- Lincoln's cabinet and its members -- at the key moment when America's peculiar institution of slavery is being fought over. However, I am glad that I read Shelby Foote's three-volume narrative history of the Civil War before Goodwin's book so that I had the biggest picture first.
