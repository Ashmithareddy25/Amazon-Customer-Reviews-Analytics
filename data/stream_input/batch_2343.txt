B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have drifted away from Rush over the last few years.  While they have delivered some quality songs in the recent past, there hasn't been an entire disc that has captured my imagination... until now.  'Clockwork Angels' is a solid effort from start to finish.  It showcases their musical range while at the same time gets back to their hard-edged rock 'n roll roots!  A must own for any RUSH fan!
1616960922|5.0|Brilliant. A whole system of belief, magic, intrigue, and danger, complete with deep, interesting, and uniquely flawed characters, all accomplished in under 200 pages.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson has a unique and distinct style that I may have taken for granted before. I had previously read the Mistborn series, and starting up with The Emperor's Soul, I felt like I was back in that world again--or at least that universe. It was actually a bit disorienting, because when I have experienced it with other authors (J.R.R. Tolkien, for example), it is usually a continuation of the same story or at least takes place in the same world.<br /><br />I loved the depth of Shai and Gaotana. They were not as deep as some of Sanderson's characters in other books, but I chalk that up to the thousands of pages that weren't spent on these ones. The interplay between the two characters was fun--each trying to figure out the other, with us only being able to see Shai's thoughts on the matter. The incredibly deep philosophical question about the nature and value of art and history was neat, and could have been explored further--I would love more stories set in this world to unearth that potential.<br /><br />The action was great, too. Sanderson has a gift with writing vibrant and detailed skirmishes. It served him well in Mistborn and A Memory of Light, and it served him well here. More delicately, the action played out differently here than in the other works I've read. There was no One Power and no Allomancy at work here, and it didn't feel like there was or that there ought to be.<br /><br />And so I look forward to when I have the time to invest in Sanderson's other significant works, as I applaud this one (and am grateful that it was short enough that I could rationalize reading it with so much other stuff on my plate).
B009D0LBRO|4.0|This game is an excellent mobile conversion of Rayman, but just like the console its technical faults and glitches hold it back.<br /><br />How do you play a sidescrolling platformer like Rayman Origins on a mobile device? Take away the joysticks and force the character to run forward, full steam ahead. Tapping on the screen lets you perform basic actions like jumping and punching, but you'll always be running forward. This works very well and is a lot of fun. The graphics and sounds are top-notch, a huge leap past most mobile games.<br /><br />The game is lengthy (for a mobile game) and quite challenging. There are a few technical hiccups which add to the challenge, and that can lead to great frustration. Sometimes the character acts strange with no apparent reason and it can cause you to lose a difficult level through no fault of your own. With enough patches, this game could earn a 5-star rating. For now, its good, but not excellent.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|I have all the Wallflower albums but I think this is my favorite.  Jakob must have needed and break and appreciates being back with a band.

B004ZRV3AU|2.0|It isn't that great and we had to try over and over again to make it work.  I would recommend trying some other product.  We managed to make possibly one good cut out of 5.

B000002UWF|5.0|I love this album & so does my 3 year old daughter who I bought it for! If you don't know what CD to buy so you have a good old fashioned album in your collection, this one is it! There were so many songs I recognised as I listened to it. Typical jazzy, old school, lively performances. Love it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game! I really like how you don't have to move your kindle in order to play. The upgrades are really cool as well as the people you can buy and the surfboards. The only thing that I would ask to be changed are the adds but its really not a big deal:)
B001E7OO2I|4.0|Great CD, good mix of upbeat & slower. Classic R&B! Great words, John Legend is a thoughtful writer & performer
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game....but why isn't kindle doing my auto update.....when the update pops up it takes you to a purchase screen but no update link
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This book was a requirement for my digital photography class. It explains in detail all the basic aspects of digital camera. This book is a must in any photographers library.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|This group is difficult to put into a specific category. The three lead vocalists have distinctly different styles but they manage to mesh beautifully. The closest I can come is folk rock with a hint of Reggae. I would say several songs are similar to Clapton's cover of \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\". My favorite song is Speeches, Which is more of a bluesy pop with horns. The harmonies are breathtaking. There's something on this album for everyone. They have an official video for Red Hands on YouTube, check it out if you want to hear before you buy.
0486474917|5.0|I ALWAYS LOVED THE SHERLOCK HOLMES BOOKS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.  SO I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRANDSON.  I HAVEN'T HEARD BACK FROM HIM HOW HE LIKED THE BOOK.
B004Z7AHTI|4.0|As kids movies go, this one was probably as much fun for me and my wife as it was for our 6 year old. Although the Wimpy Kid himself isn't such a great role model (he really comes off like kind of a jerk a lot of the time), his antics are funny and the actors really fit the parts.  Our kids love seeing some of the actors from their favorite Disney shows, and we all love the awesome music of Loded Diaper (or more specifically, the way mom dances to Loded Diaper)!
0061733199|5.0|I just scratched the surface of this book, there is so much info in here it is a must have for anyone that likes the outdoors and goes on camping or hunting trips! Just so much info in here that can make you day so much easier or even save your life!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Super great,intrigue,drama. Wonderful read. Just as good as the first book. Can not wait to read number 3 book. Highly recommend.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far I am liking the app. I have yet to spend any money. But one issue I am having is not being able to connect with my Facebook account.
0547848412|5.0|Deep, insightful, thrilling, though-provoking. Must read all the way through. Loved it, highly recommend it, especially if you have a few days to read it start to finish.
B001YB29HG|4.0|Only problem I had, was that after a few days it began stopping at a certain point in the film, and now gets stuck there for a second every time. Still watchable though.
B009X011UQ|4.0|This case is wonderful protection for my new Kindle, and I love the snazzy color. I wish it had a little bit more secure way to stand upright, though. I followed the directions, and it doesn't always stay on the incline like it should. I don't stand it up too much since I mainly read on my Kindle, so this was not a huge issue for me. Otherwise, I am very pleased with this.
1401922732|5.0|Ive done two readings and both were right on.  Being from Archangel Michael there is no doubt in my mind that they are trust worthy.  The artwork and detail is beautiful.  The explantions etc and booklet that comes with it are very imformative. Impressive
B0063IH60K|4.0|i enjoy playing solitaire and find this game easy to play.i have not been playing this game for lack of time, but hope to soon.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really liked this book!!! It was just the right mix of romance, it kept you wanting to get to the next chapter to see what was gonna happen.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|We enjoy this game. However it takes forever to get enough $ to buy items. I invested over $40 personally so daughter could get the good houses and pets and lost it because the game messed up. Now no one can help us get the funds back. Really stinks.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This one completes my set, I watched it at the movies, now I can watch it anytime. My grandkids love it too!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent there should be more books like this series. I would definitely recommend this trilogy to others.  I think they would thank me!
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Like the two previous books in the Clifton Chronicles this book grips you from the very first page, only negative point is that I have to wait a long time for the fourth book to be released.  I will buy it the day it is released.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I like this game!<br />this is a fun, challenging and relaxing pastime. I recommend it!<br />I don't understand the choosing a place to build aspect but it doesn't matter.
0307165485|5.0|I was actually looking for Richard Scarry's Biggest Book Ever and ordered this  by mistake. I thought this was the other. After it arrived I looked up the other and saw the price. Oh my! I will stick with this. My daughter had the Biggest Book and became the smartest child in the school. I wanted to do the same with my nephew
B00BR476TG|4.0|Just enough to whet your appetite.  Fast action indicating what was to come, and curiosity about the whole story unfolding.

B001OSIV62|4.0|Really good documentary about wire walking, but I have to say that my favorite part is seeing the twin towers again.  I have fond memories of them and the view from on top.  I have to say that was my favorite part, not the wire walking!

B007MNV5WU|1.0|Sorry,this is worst game of all I have purchased for the children. And, not worth 2.99. The free games are more fun and challenging. PLEASE,would like refund ASAP. Thank you.

B002JWD6AS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Couldn't put it down.  A great read, a true love story!!!!  Love at its deepest!
B001EAWMGA|5.0|A great movie for any die-hard sci-fi fan! Let me start by saying that I had never heard of Outlander until a co-worker had mentioned it one day. As he gave me a breakdown, I thought, \\"Wow, it sounds like a play on Beowulf!\\". But I was skeptical at first because my friend loved cheesy, low budget, Sci-fi Channel B movies. I finally caught it on Sci-fi one day and was really shocked at how good the movie is! Is it Oscar material? Well no, but it is well written and actually doesn't fall flat on it's face for sci-fi plausibility. Is the CGI cutting edge? Well no, but it's done well and I've seen worse on bigger budget films. The scenery is down right beautiful and they actually constructed a believable Viking village for this movie. The acting is actually handled really well with the exception of Ron Perlman. I really wanted to like him in this movie and for some of it I did. However, the biggest complaint I have is he couldn't keep his \\"Viking\\" accent straight through the entire movie. Jim Caviezel played a good hero, a bit flat, but it helped separate him from the rest of the cast who were all \\"Vikings\\". John Hurt did a fine job as the village king and brought a lot of experience to the movie with his part. The creatures were \\"scary\\" and as the movie progresses, you can actually attempt to sympathize with them. I would say about the only plot hole I really had a problem with was when the \\"Outlander\\" retrieves a piece of his space faring ship for Iron Age Vikings to forge new weapons out of. Aside from that, I really enjoyed this movie. I would definitely recommend this to any sci-fi fan.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is so much fun. It is very addicting and very quick. You don't sit around waiting for energy.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It downloads .mp3 wonderfully.  So fast that you barely see it downloading.  I would reccomend this app to anyone with an android.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I just purchased this game and couldn't stop until I got through the first 8 chests.  Plays and looks great on Kindle Fire HD.  I don't know what is in store for me next so I'm anxious to get back to the game!  I thought the one minute timer would stress me out but it's all good!  Definitely worth the .99!  Enjoy!
B008602KQI|5.0|I have heard so much about this movie and the books. I honestly thought it was just overhyped like Twilight. However, it was a breath of fresh air. I am 23 years old and have to say that although this movie may be for kids, I loved it! It kept my attention throughout. A+!! I can't wait for the rest of the series! I may even read the books now.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Have shared this DVD and everyone who sees it just raves. What a positively inspiring movie/story! Would love to see what else this director has to offer.
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|El CD tiene excelentes versiones de temas como New York State of Mind y Heroes. Lea Michelle cada día canta mejor.<br />Es una lástima que en la temporada 4 hayan editado pocos CDs.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I was so impressed with the lead actor. He was so perfect for the role. His older version was just the right one for his role as well. Will share this with many who have not yet read the book.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|When I first used this stylus, which was right after I received it and it simply didn't work on my ipad.  The only tip that worked was the largest tip.  The smallest tip was totally useless and the mid size tip was a hit and miss.  I was so disappointed with the result and the high ratings on this, and put it away and get it ready to return back  So, after the weekend was over, I can't wait to return this stylus and still feeling being cheated.  I made the request for a full refund as well as printed out the labels and then just before I packaged it up, I've decided to give it another try.  To my surprise, this time the smallest tip worked!  The only reason that I buy stylus is for writing purpose on my ipad (UPAD is my favorite app for writing and the smallest tip is flawless on this app), so the smaller the tips the most ideal it would be, granted that it must work.  Now all three tips work well!  I truly believe that by sitting in my house for a few days, the rubber tips got softer and weren't rigid and stiff like when I first used them.  Even though the smallest tip works fine on my ipad now, but it is still not as responsive on the iphone.  Larger tips should be used on the iphone.<br /><br />Now to the flaw side of this stylus.  The cap which has the largest tip is very lose fitting when capped over the smallest tip. It will fall off it I quickly turns it over to use the biggest tip.  It should be as snug fitting as over the mid-sized tip (the mid-size tip has a ruber ring so it keeps the cap snug.  Other than that, some have mentioned that the circumference opening of the cap is very sharp, which is true, so to some this might be bothersome depeding on where you hold the stylus.  I'm OK with it, but noticed that sometimes that sharpness does feel a little harsh on the side of my index finger.<br /><br />The tips of the stylus are very responsive.  I would recommend it since I'm keeping it and not returning it.<br /><br />**Just changed my four stars to five stars!  I realized that one of the flaws that I mentioned was not a flaw!  It was something that I didn't know before, but discovered later.  The cap will fit snuggly over the smallest tip.  I didn't know that I needed to push it in a little so that it clicks right in!
1439156816|5.0|I gave this to my husband, who is writing his Arctic memoirs - he says it is the best book he has ever read about the craft of writing. Concise, funny, readable, he has been pouring over it for a month and making notes. Good job, Stephen King!
B00001PE4D|4.0|Most amusing plot overall with a bittersweet ending.<br />Good to almost beliviable acting.<br />LOVE THE CAR! But who would not?<br />Movie music is okay,<br />Ending music rocks.
0307269981|2.0|this is the first time I have been disappointed in the condition of a book ordered on Amazon.<br />the book appeared to have been wet and dried out later. would return, but not worth the hassle.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is easily in my top three favorite books of all time.  While it can be a bit hard to read at times, the voice of &#34;Jacker Jack&#34; shines through and carries the story.  It's an absolute must-read.  It will change your life!

B00AYQNOU8|5.0|OMG! I rented this movie so my family can see it.  It is so beautiful and meaningful. There are no words needed, this movie self explains itself. I am going to buy it and add it to my collection of favorite movies.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|I loved Adele's 21 album but this one was okay.  I mean her voice is still amazing but the songs were just okay.  I loved 3 songs from the albums and the rest were okay.
B00AYB1GAS|5.0|This movie is breath takingly beautiful!  The photography is stunning and the message is captivating.  Everyone should watch this movie.
B003TT2X72|4.0|This is my least favorite of the trilogy but it was still good.  If you like fantasy/ Sci-fi you will like this trilogy.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great film to watch with my kiddos. Good message, okay for little eyes and yet funny for adults! Enjoy this movie!
B00A50PE6K|4.0|Silent night is one of my favorite songs in this album Naya did such a great job with it.  Again if you are a glee fan it is hard for you not to like this album!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Please note that I saw this on a movie channel so that I can't comment on the quality of the DVD release or its features.<br /><br />Lincoln is an exceptional movie but not for everyone as the wordy and archaic dialog will be off-putting for some modern viewers (and as I confirmed by reading several dozen of the reviews). But for those with the patience to stick it out, the movie offers an extraordinary and in-depth account of a brief but defining moment in Lincoln's career--the passing of the 13th amendment to the Constitution. Lincoln shows himself to be the consummate politician as he at turns persuades, cajoles, charms, bullies, threatens, and buys his way to the passage of what at first seems a measure that is doomed to fail. Indeed, at first blush his chances appear well nigh hopeless as even his otherwise faithful cabinet seems to doubt him and even his sanity. But Lincoln's energy, zeal, and sheer craftiness and popularity with the public are no match for his opponents. And when tensions run too high, not the least of his talents is that Lincoln always had a funny story or anecdote to defuse the situation.<br /><br />I was also pleased to see so many fine character actors in various roles (such as Bruce McGill and Walton Goggins) who are not as well known to the general public compared to Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, and David Spader, who had major parts. Jones was superb as the fast talking Thaddeus Stephens and of course Sally Fields is a long way from \\"The Flying Nun\\" with her riveting portrayal of Mary Todd Lincoln.<br /><br />Overall a fine movie with a career climaxing and defining performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, who shows that, when it came to Lincoln and his 13th Amendment, that if you were against it, \\"He will find you!\\" :-)***<br /><br />***Note: An allusion to Day-Lewis's famous line in \\"Last of the Mohicans.\\"

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game!!! I need a new Kindle and started the game all over again.  It is even fun the second time around. And it really is free. I have been playing for over a year and they keep upgrading it. Well worth it!!!!
0385349831|5.0|Paulo Coelho is one of my favorite authors. He always writes such amazing books! And the best thing is that all his books are short, but at the same time intense and beautiful. I've always thought that he is simple but profound, and his histories make you rethink your whole world. I remember reading The Alchemist when I was 16... in a very specific way, it just changed me. And because of that, I wanted to read \\"Manuscript found in Accra\\" as soon as I got the chance. It is just... great. As other Coelho's books, it takes you to another world and the story just surrounds you. You can't stop reading and you see yourself immersed in a charming but deep history. \\"Manuscript found in Accra\\" just goes back to the beginning. I really appreciated that while I was reading, and I felt again that magic, like when I read \\"The Alchemist\\". That magic is exactly what makes books great. And this new book makes you think about some of the most basic things of your life and your world. It is original but structured, easy to read and inspiring. Just perfect... as always.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book in the Mockingjay trilogy is pretty much like the first. Good  vs. Evil and not many surprises.

B00364K6YW|5.0|Casting was perfect as was the costuming and set design. Jane Austen at it's best !! Highly reccomended. It will sweep you away.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is a cute little game i love it, just dont like that its just stops working and boots me out every one in awhile.
0063120046|5.0|This is always a great book. A good old standard and a must read if you haven't already done so.
B003MC5N28|5.0|One of my students recommended this book to me. I read it in a weekend. There are many themes to explore: truth and lie, utilitarianism, choice and social control, good and evil, power. It's like 1984 without the strong political overtones. Or a simplified Brave New World. I would like to design lessons around this novel and study it with my freshmen!
B005LAII12|1.0|I do not recommend this movie.  Story line was o.k., but I'm not  fan of the language.  Not recommended. It is to bad they have ruin a movie with that sort of thing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love mobilityWare's solitare game but don't like the ads every game. Can't you develop a paid version like you have for i products, so we don't have the ads??
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I have read several books written by ex-military personnel and I can honestly say this was a truly interesting book.  I could not wait to pick it up each day.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|This watch have the style, perfect finish. And the price is just fine for your pocket. Strongly recomended, i would buy again this brand.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is THE FIRST Amazon Instant Video review I've ever written, I can't be bothered taking the time to write one, and I've watched LOADS of films and tv shows here. But this documentary is SO GOOD I just had to say and share it. Like the title says I couldn't believe this film had 5 stars from so many reviewers, I'd actually never even seen a perfect review from so many people before, and figured it was rigged somehow. Not at all. THIS IS AN AMAZING, INSPIRING, AND UPLIFTING FILM and absolutely worth a perfect 5 star rating. This dude needs to get what's due him, even if he chooses to give it all away.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|Archer is getting lazy and greedy.  The Clifton Chronicles have huge gaps, characters not developed, plots hinted at.  Each book ends on a cliff hanger so you have to buy the next book.  Very disappointed.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!  I HAVE THESE ON MY LAPTOP AND WAS VERY HAPPY TO SEE THIS AVAILABLE ON THE KINDLE FIRE. I HAVE A LOT OF GAMES THAT I ACQUIRED FROM BIG FISH AND THIS IS STILL MY FAVORITE.  Thank you PLAYRIX!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I enjoyed this very much.Sometimes a little too detailed but well worth the read. I'd recomend it to a friend or anyone else who enjoys reading.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I've just started using the game, but it's a blast. If you're an Angry Birds fan then this version is a must-buy.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good game. Pretty addicting.  One thing that sucks is how long you have to wait for some of the stuff unless you wanna spend real money. Guess that's the way games go now though.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Still good and strong, the last 2 seasons ....well, there is no end to say the bare minimum, I had hope.....
B009UZBLSG|5.0|It works great on my Android LG Nexus 4 phone.  No restarting, just plug in the adapter and watch on the big screen!
B00364K6YW|3.0|I have to admit that I saw the Keira Knightly version first. I do love Colin Firth but I did not like the other actresses in this adaptation. They were all...frumpy and usual Whereas Keira's beauty stands out! I also loved Matthew MacFayden's performance as Mr. Darcy. My wonderful neice made me watch the movie then I read the book and became an instant Jane Austen fan - just ask my husband, I watch the movie at least once a week!! It is now my favorite but I prefer the Keira Knightly/Matthew MacFayden version.
0393037010|3.0|For me a 'hard' read, between the old English words and expressions and a lot of nautical terms.  Great story, but for me it required a lot of focus.  Not an easy read, but a very good one.  If into old English would strongly recommend it.  Will not follow up as to 'hard' for me.<br /><br />Got it because reviewer said that the 'Richard Sharpe's' series was continuation of O'Briens work.  In same tradition, but about 100 years before in writing.  Recommend for intense reader.<br /><br />Red Rider
0765325950|4.0|Another good book by these authors, but this time I thought it had too much going on, without good justification--tho' it WAS a page-turner, if you didn't stop to consider, \\"why that?\\".  Newbies should be aware that this IS a saga or epic, assuming knowlege of all of the preceding volumes, so readers just starting with this book will just be lost (except for all of the mayhem).
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Hard to believe I had never read this classic before.  I would rank this work alongside Dostoyefsky's Crime and Punishment both for its gripping narrative and its redemptive theme.  Given the length of the work, though, I would issue one caveat for those who, like me, are neither francophones nor steeped in French history: read quickly through the chapters Hugo intersperses throughout the novel that depart from the main storyline for the purpose of providing background.  Whether describing in laborious detail the aftermath of a battlefield or the sewer system of Paris, they do tie back in important ways to the characters and their fates, but the detail is so dense as to discourage the novice who tries too hard to understand it all in depth.  Better to move quickly through those, taking in the major details, and then savor the parts that carry you back into the main current of the novel.  Rich character development and suspense that leaves you hanging until the last page mark Hugo as a great artist, and this is his magnum opus.  A truly grand work that touches the soul in profound ways.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|Another Holmes victory over evil. I thoroughly enjoyed following Dr. watsons accounts of events and then watching Holmes as he unravelled the mystery. Good show!

014050639X|5.0|I read this book so often to my children when they were young, I practically have it memorized and can still recite most of it.  I have now purchased it for my first grandchild.  The simple rhymes and the hide-n-seek on each page make it a fun but short read.  And, the artwork is absolutely amazing!  Still one of my favorites after all these years.

B004SUWR2C|3.0|A good game to have if you are bored and want to play a card game either alone or with other people. The only thing is there are new rules, such as card swapping that I have to get used to as I only played the original game.<br />Fun semi 'classic' game.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I have a fascination for the Korean Peninsula and the contrast between the two Koreas.<br />I liked the book because it showed life in North Korea, that we don't hear about....from someone who has experienced it and lived it.<br />I would recommend that everyone read this book so they could understand what is really going on in North Korea.

B00000ILDF|4.0|I thought this movie was going to be absolutely awful...I was wrong, but it definitely wasn't great. Every character I cared about died early on or by the end of the movie and some of the CGI footage of the alien running was laughable. I recommend watching it, but keep in mind, the first two movies are MUCH better.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is for people who like dinosaurs or Jurassic park by itself, in my view, this is one of my favorite game and it will also be one of yours.

I use it with a Roku 2, my kids stream in their iPhones, my wife on the Samsung HDTV.... and now with Kindle HD Fire I can sit on the patio. AND yes it does work with HD content just fine. I love that Plex gives you information on the movies you choose, only going to get better.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|So, I bought this for my boyfriend who happens to be an aspiring body builder and has been working out for a year now. He loved it! It inspired him to work out even harder and actually he stopped half way through the film to go outside and squat. Ha, so as a woman who saw the excitement in my guy's eyes and how they twinkle like a boy during christmas, and saw how much he talked about it after, great buy indeed.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Riveting and beautifully produced.  Ultra liberals wil not like it, it portrays rich people as actually being nice people...for shame.
B006IMY5ZU|4.0|I'm a statistician but not a baseball fan.  With everyone pointing at the movie about how it highlighted a statistician as a key figure, I was expecting more.  But the movie is more about Bean than it is him.<br /><br />And, incidently, the Bosox did not entirely adapt Bean's approach to win their Series.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I have missed a bunch not listening to her till now. The two album set is just terrific. Its not for the faint of heart though its Her sound through and through. She has a voice that is haunting. Highly recommended.

You can do one or a multiple of sounds at the same time...wind chimes, waves, birds, etc.  But be forewarned, you can almost watch your Kindle battery icon deplete it's power.  I've used it with ear buds in the Dentist chair and when having other terrifying medical procedures done.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|\\"Harry Potter: The Complete 8 Film Collection\\"<br /><br />Over the Spring break my family indulged in a Harry Potter film festival, watching all eight movies in the course of a few days. It was great. I was an adult reader of the first book, and made my way through the whole series, even with the tedium at the end. My wife and I saw the first couple of movies together when they came out, but then gave up after that - the first film didn't have the same magic as the book, and the second was just a little too cutesy and coy for my tastes. Maybe we were just too old for this stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, fast forward a decade or so and here we are with a kid whose life is saturated with Potter, Spidey and Star Wars and we figured it was time to just go for it... so break out the popcorn and hand me the remote!<br /><br />It was a great viewing experience, and frankly, more fun than the books, especially the later volumes in the series. At some point the literary enterprise and the Hollywood phenomenon became closely entwined and Ms. Rowling clearly began writing her books almost as if they were production notes for the films. And, as it turns out, that was just fine. \\"The Deathly Hallows\\" is a terrible book -- uneventful, dreary, repetitive and full of lifeless exposition -- but the screen version, especially taken in the context of the other films, is quite good. Indeed, watching all the movies together in a short time period was a potent experience, making the characters and their losses and growth more resonant and powerful -- the transitions from childhood to maturity, and the purposeful changes in emotional tone from film to film are more easily seen as part of a purposeful and elegant mosaic. Although Rowling (arguably) may have dropped the ball on the books, her overall vision for the saga comes through well in these films and although Harry remains a relatively flat character, the tragedy and complexity of Severus Snape is impressive in such a mega-mainstream entertainment juggernaut. Chris Columbus's formulaic direction of the first two films threw me off the scent many years ago, but I'm glad I came back to it now. It's a worthwhile journey.

B005CVWWJY|4.0|This book is fun, and  managed to squeeze some of the original joy of SF out of someone as jaded as me.<br /><br />It's not trying for world shaking or Deep and Meaningful, however I think it'll stay with me for a good long while.<br /><br />Its chief flaw is being a little too Cory Doctorow, with the protagonists just a little too competent and affable, with too little grime and bastardry to be fully satisfying.<br /><br />But in the end, I don't really care. Remember discovering Alan Dean Foster when you were a kid? This feels like that, even now.<br /><br />Buy this, and read it when you need cheering up.
B002R5HR70|5.0|This movie shows a alot of love and care for a person. You should watch this to look further into a person instead of just judging them up from. Do not judge a book by its cover!!!

1250007208|5.0|I am a guaranteed sucker when it comes to fairy-tale retellings. I'm an even bigger sucker when that fairy-tale retelling is AWESOME SAUCE!<br /><br />I started Cinder in the airport awaiting the flight for my trip to Disney World - yes, I purposely brought Cinder with me as I thought it quite an appropriate book to be reading for said trip.<br /><br />Well let's hear it for 2 hour long plane trips! I could not put this book down.<br /><br />I love Meyer's twist on the fairy-tale. Cinder is adopted (and half android), her younger step-sister loves her, her only friend is a sassy robot named Iko, she's a mechanic, and she isn't the sing-song sweet Cinderella everybody knows.<br /><br />I liked the interaction between Cinder and Prince Kai - much more than a love-at-first-sign attraction, which I really appreciated. They formed a bond and met many times before the pivotal ballroom scene. We also get to see more of the Prince and his side of the story, verse everything from Cinder's point of view.<br /><br />There were plot points that I thought to be somewhat predictable, but it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the plot. I knew what the twist was going to be, but I think Meyer took us there is a very enjoyable way and I didn't care that I had figured it out some x-amount of pages ago.<br /><br />I also really liked the fact that Livia wasn't defeated in Cinder and will appear in the subsequent novels. It's a different aspect than to some series I've read (I'm referring to ones where the main character is always different, but they take place in the same universe type deal) where the Big Bad changes with each novel. This will really give Meyer the opportunity to explore Livia's character and (I think) end in an epic-epic battle where - yes, I'm going to say it - they all live happily ever after.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book yet, do it! Even if you're not a huge fan of fairy-tale retellings, Meyer creates a story that is so much more than that.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I bought this unit to replace a Memorex unit that broke down on me. Granted, the Memorex unit was a &#34;do it all&#34; machine and this turntable only makes computer files out of vinyl records (to be burned to CD's), but what a job it does! It also hooks up to my Sherwood stereo receiver and plays my vinyl records as well as any other receiver I've ever owned and, at 64 years old, I've owned a few. I was already recording with Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio Version 10 software before I bought this turntable, but it comes with an older version of this software included. A fine unit and, oh yeah, it looks great and fits right in with my other stereo gear!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Read the book in two days, I had difficulty putting it down. Another good book from Nicholas Sparks. This book will have you reflecting upon yourself.

B00005R87K|5.0|If you enjoy the old silent movies, and the way they were forced by that absence of audio to overact, THIS is THE beginning of the silver screen career of &#34;Dracula&#34; - the most filmed single character in all of filmdom (approx 28 films). Max Schreck's portrayal of the father of all vampires was impressive. Overlooking the fact that the master from which the DVD was cut is fairly scratchy, it's fun to watch the &#34;old school&#34; of film actors. Recommend!!
B002L6I9Z4|1.0|I bought two for two grandchildren age 3 and 5.  Both kids have taken pictures with their parents' iPhones and know how to frame a picture, hold the camera still and snap the picture.  I should have bought them real cameras.<br /><br />The camera is advertised to hold 80 pictures; it does not hold anything close to that.  One holds 12 and no more and the other 50.  Worse yet, when you delete a photo on the camera, it does not free up disk space; you need to delete the photos (even the \\"deleted\\" ones) when connected to a computer to create space for additional photos.  In addition the camera takes terrible pictures.  One of the cameras was used; there were at least 10 pictures of another family on the camera and my grandson was only able to take two additional pictures before the camera was out of memory for additional pictures.<br /><br />Finally, most toddlers know how to use their parents' smart phones and iPads. The controls on the camera are primitive, non-intuitive and hard to use.  Whoever designed them doesn't understand how kids manipulate electronic devices.<br /><br />I have nothing good to say about the cameras.  I am returning both to Amazon.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|It is poorly written, it took me three tries just to get into it. The similarities to Twilight are too strong, and not that they are vampires. It's just that she (like Bella) is also a klutz, and keeps referring to him as &#34;beautiful&#34; (also Twilight-ish) I don't think I even got half-way through the book when I just gave up.

They adore pork, love fish, eat turtle for good for longevity, eat snake, but only in winter since it is a warm food.  They even raise a black skinned chicken which is good for pregnant women.<br />L<br />Dr. Campbell selectivly uses data to ;prove his point.. He states in his cookbook:Don't eat fish, they have feelings<br /><br />Save your money.  I found Dr. Hyman's Blood Sugar Solution  excellent and in just 15 days on his diet my endocrinologist stopped my insulin shots and decreased the Glipizide to by half.  I have lost 12 pountd too.

I like spending 60min during a workout.<br /><br />I like the DVD menu. For example, if you finish level 1, you can go to level 2, and the dvd menu allows you to skip the warm up and go straight to the workout. That is a good feature for those trying to do more than one routine.<br /><br />Her 3-2-1 makes the workout go really fast.

B0092ZEIN4|4.0|I really like the playpad, though I have a few minor quibbles:<br /><br />1. It's too light for my taste, it makes it feel flimsy. For travel, I understand why they went with light-weight, but I feel like I'm holding a controller made of egg shell.<br />2. The key mapping has a weird bug where one of my buttons keeps resetting to a copy of an adjacent button whenever I turn it off and back on. Not a major problem, it's just another step in the flow to sync it up, but it's a problem nonetheless.<br />3. When I load up the Nyko Playground app, it automatically starts to sync with the gamepad, however it will go on indefinitely. I have to close the sync and re-try it. It goes through every time on the second try though.<br /><br />So all in all, it's a good product. The two bugs/flaws add a mere 10 seconds to my setup time, and that's not bad at all; but it's enough that I wouldn't say it's 100% the best thing every. 4/5
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I was required to read this book for a class and ended up loving it.  Lisa Genova did a wonderful job in giving the reader a realistic perspective on what living with Alzheimer's is like.  She is able to illustrate a narrative in such a way that is not difficult to understand. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read and an honest portrayal of what Alzheimer's is like.

B000W7JWUA|3.0|This game can be very fun or very boring depending upon how the dice rolls go.  I've played games in which everyone had a good time and others in which at least one person had almost nothing to do as the dice rolls don't necessarily follow the odds.  Talk about boring and it can put you so far behind that it is very difficult or impossible to recover.  The add-ons to the game might help.  Cities and Knights is far more interesting than just the base game, but I find that the dice still hate me and I've lost interest in playing.

0307346617|5.0|I don't regret spending my money on this, it's an awesome book for a good price. Very pleased and it came before expected :)
1476734941|5.0|The reason for doing this OR one of the three ways of eating advocated by the researchers and doctors on the PBS show Eat, Fast and Live Longer with Michael Mosley is for the HEALTH benefits achieved when the bodies levels of IGF-1 drop. Dropping the IGF levels in our bodies, as shown by research, are proving to impart great health benefits. Watch the this PBS documentary on line and perhaps gain some understanding on this way of eating and the science behind the research.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|This series is amazing. I bought every season and I am wondering if there bringing out a movie to help support the end.
B004YXE438|5.0|Fantastic for exercising brainpower. Plenty of different pictures and difficulties by varying sizes. Kids love it when you create your own.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game keeps the player entertained. The updates and the new designs keep the gamer wanting more. I can personally say that I have grown an addiction to this game!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Excellent help from Amazon people and product works!!!!  They were helpful and you could actually understand what they were saying.  All in all a very good experience.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|This was an amazing in depth look at life as seen through a very courageous and caring person. I don't believe it just speaks about his life but many that have served present and past.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it all the time in class!! I may not use all the stuff, but none the less, I use it daily to study, write important memos!! I love it!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really liked it.  A very hard book to put down.  I usually like &#34;current day&#34; sci-fi a bit less than slightly more futuristic, but this one really grabbed me.  All the technical details seemed right on (and by the way, I really LIKED all the details.  The &#34;how will he solve THIS problem&#34; parts.<br /><br />As to the language...I take it as just a realism.  It was no big deal to me...
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Great case, fits perfectly. The only thing that's missing is a place to store a stylus - although most if not all of the available cases available here don't have this option.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|i love plague inc but when i play the nano  virus, i lost all the time on normal mode.please take off the kill code!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|The app works as adverised. Great!l I do wish the Pro version offered more, but as I said works well. Perfect for your tablet or larger phone.
B005B0QYMM|4.0|GRAVE ENCOUNTERS starts out as a parody of those \\"reality\\" ghost hunter shows, complete w/ an overly-dramatic host, a psychic, and an occult expert. The humor comes from the raw, unedited footage, where the stars mock / condemn the fakery of their own show! Next, along w/ their film crew, our paranormal investigators enter an abandoned, supposedly haunted mental institution. After having themselves locked in for the night, our fearless adventurers set up their equipment, and settle in for what they believe will be a long, dull evening. What follows is a slowly spiraling decent into madness, terror, and death. The mid-section of ENCOUNTERS is nearly perfect in its build-up. Unfortunately, the finale is abrupt and a bit of a buzz-kill. However, as \\"found footage\\" movies go, this one is pretty damned good. As w/ most of these films, its best when viewed in total darkness...
B004FN16DS|5.0|Very readable, non-technical explanation of international economics, the problems of neoliberal economics, and provides enough information to be an informed voter considering candidates' economic policies and who they benefit.
B002BJGYV2|1.0|I ordered the complete fifth season of the Gilmore Girls on April, 3rd; and although it arrived in a timely manner, the DVD container was destroyed. The quality of the DVD's is fine, but I think I deserve a new, whole, unbroken box.<br /><br />I DO NOT want to replace the product, I just want a new box.  Is that possible?
B0002KZAKS|5.0|20 dollar microphone that basically works?  Perfect.  Case, perfect.  Can't tell the difference between this and a shure that costs 5x as much.  Go OEM philipino manufacturers go.
B002BJGYTY|4.0|The package arrived in a timely manner, the DVD container was undamaged, and the DVDs' quality is good.  I also ordered the complete fifth season of the Gilmore Girls at the same time, but the DVD container was destroyed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing solitaire but it suddenly went away from my Kindle Fire so I can't play it anymore.  I want to be able to play it again.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I update it on kindle fire no problem. (Remove it from Kindle not from cloud, then install it from store. )
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Love the honesty and the story. Anthony Kiedis is an amazing man and an inspiration. Thanks for sharing your life with the world... the good and the bad!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is a great series!!!!!!  I watched the first episode and was hooked.  I watched the entire series in one weekend.
B0058SNIC6|3.0|These are a 9 that had to be ordered for a usually Sz 81/2 and are way too big! Very wide cut as well! But they are cute and had they fit .. i would have loved them. I do think they would have been great to run around in all summer in casual clothes to beachwear..but since croc do not come in 1/2 sizes watch the width unless you have wide feet because you cant adjust them at the strap and they slip off! The half size would not have been as bad in the clog style<br />because they would stay on anyway..very disappointing<br />and because they came with a plastic piece you must<br />cut to try them on and walk in them..I am stuck finding someone to give them to with a large foot! I cant send<br />them back! Only risk it if u know they fit..because as i<br />said..had they fit..would be great . Very good as far as<br />comfort and seem like they would hold up a Long time!! Hope this helps.. style is cute..
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Another great Mission Impossible movie from Tom Cruise.  Action everywhere and always has cool toys to work with that make his job easy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Interest is my favorite place to look at nails,hair,fashion or pretty much any thing!! I love it so much!! If u get this I promise together 'll love it so much! Just like me. If you like .end fashion women fashion, nails, tattoos or really anything you'll lobe pintrest!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!!!  It is a very touching and spiritual movie.  I highly recommend this movie, it was GREAT!!!!!!!
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Bought this album cause my kids loved the lazy song then quickly came to realize my husband and i enjoy the entire album. There are some great songs on here and it was money well spent.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I love this movie.  Kate Beckinsale is once again a sexy vampire bad ass!!!!  I would love to see more of her in even more of these movies.
B00AATV046|5.0|Yes, this is a classic.  It is a heart warming Christmas movie full of good cheer and inspiration.  Values lacking in many of today's CG filled offerings.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Fantastic movie.  I am very glad they made this movie in two parts and didn't cram everything into just one part.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book is such an easy read and so capturing. By the end of the book you really feel like you got to know all of the characters and their personalities. It was an amazing book and I would probably read it again sometime. I'm excited to see the movie now because wanted to finish the book first!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This series is great!!!  I am almost finished with the second season now and can't wait until the third is available!!!!
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|Although I would have loved more explaining of the story, it is very entertaining and visually great! Many emotional moments for an animated movie, good for the whole family.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book. Had heard much about it when the movie came out, but when it's a book-to-movie with a lot of press, I prefer to read the original. I was surprised that there was so much humor, the expression of which seemed almost childlike & innocent. The ending was not at all what I expected--or maybe had been disappointed by in the past. I could often see myself right there with Pi, feel his suffering & fear, yet appreciate his way of looking at things in an original & creative way. Great fun to read. Need more storied like this one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. Always something new to try and beat. It is the Never ending game. Love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|very good free solitaire game have had it for quite a while now and absolutely no complaints at all, not even with the ads which you have to assume with a free game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addicting and fun. Great way to pass free time. My son and boyfriend try to over on my game all the tim.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|These DVD sets were given as an early anniversary gift. The recipients love this series & give it 5 stars.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|My wife and I got hooked on this series in the middle of it. Then we HAD to get the story from the beginning. It gives an interesting view of the lives the different classes used to live in the UK.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely pleased to be able to watch all episodes while working on my computer. Not only that, I can return and watch the shows more than once.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|As soon as I bought the 1st and 2nd seasons I already knew that I was going to have to have the latest. I wasn't disappointed. The only frustration was that after the Season Finale, we have to wait almost a year to get the next installment, number one of Season Four!!!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|All I CAN SAY IS AWESOME.  THE NARRATOR WAS INCREDIBLE.  HIS DICTION WAS PERFECT.  THROUGH HIS ABILITY TO TELL NOT JUST READ THE STORY I  COMPLETELY ENJOYED IT AND IN MY OPINION THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE GREATEST CLASSICS EVER WRITTEN.  SUCH FEELING AND DESCRIPTIVE STORYTELLING.  I FELT LIKE I WAS LIVING IN THE 1800'S
B009AMANH4|2.0|good thing my player has a fast forward.  Boring,same ol' same ol' actors. Lewis's part wasn't so hard.  over rated movie that was really boring about backstabbing,underhanded, lying, cheating, politicians that we are used to.  The story line is not true.  The war was not fought because of slavery.  Do some research to find out the real truth.  Don't buy the discs. Hollywood is cheap and the hype is getting tiresome.  They are the ones telling you this movie should be hailed as the greatest thing since skimmed milk...... I wonder when they will pump out a series on each one of the presidents, beginning with Washington.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was definitely a page turner! It further revealed the dark side of Christian Grey and the reasoning behind his motives.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I bought this item as a gift for my dad. It skipped and jumped around, it was hard to forward and backup because it skipped an entire section. My dad asked me if I burned this copy or if it was a pirated copy...I said it shouldn't be I ordered it from Amazon...bad quality.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|good for different age groups,good peer lessons learned in the movie,and lots of laughter to help you laugh at yourself sometimes.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|Embarrassing on every level. The movie is like a flash mob of mediocrity if mediocrity was unwatchable, unlistenable and nonsensical.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|This video is a huge hit in our household. My nephew is 1 years old and this is HIS new favorite video. The colors are vivid and the graphics are amazing. The story line is just precious. Disney knocked it out of the park with this one! Young and old are sure to enjoy watching this. Without a doubt it is the next Disney classic!
0307887960|5.0|For the past two years, I watched several co-workers lose weight and keep it off.  I decided to try it and it is super easy to follow.  I lost 15 lbs in two months!
034580404X|5.0|I was hooked! Maybe not something you want to read in a room full of people....but books you will have a hard time putting down!
0824835921|5.0|I only recently purchased this book as a helping tool to learning Japanese. I'm not an advanced student, I don't speak anywhere near fluent Japanese and I wouldn't even say I'm past intermediate. Even so, I found this book to be extremely helpful. It teaches you kanji in a simple and fast way, but it does require some hard work to actually remember them a week later.<br /><br />I have nothing negative to say about this book, in fact, I think it's one of the best I've seen. However, I think that you should be aware that this doesn't really improve your Japanese at all. Sure, you might know what certain kanji mean, but you can't read it. This book doesn't teach you readings, they teach you meanings, and it's up to you yourself to find out in what situations a certain kanji is used. This isn't a bad thing, necessarily, but I want you to be aware of that. It's not a book that will teach you Japanese, it'll only help you remember meanings and stroke orders.<br /><br />When you use this book, it's easy to get sucked in by your progress. This is something you can measure, you see, follow up on and check. You can litterally see how much you've improved in a week, or in a month, and that makes you want to improve even more. I got stuck in this for a while, studying only kanji and neglecting the actual language. You won't be able to speak any Japanese at all, even after finishing this whole book, and that is after all the most important thing.<br /><br />So shortly, buy this book, I truly recommend it. But make sure you keep up with the rest of the language - grammar, vocab etc. as well. :) But yeah, this book is awesome. If you're preparing for JLPT tests, this could be a major helping tool ~ c':
0425263916|5.0|Slyvia has done it again.....As I was for the first....I was for the 2nd...HOOKED!! I love these books. Can not wait for the 3rd!!!!
B000FC1HQY|5.0|I am not an Amazon reviewer typicallly, but I have to say that I loved this book.  It is beautifully written, and does a brilliant job portraying what it was like to grow up as a white African in the 80s.<br /><br />If you liked The Glass Castle, this is a similarly poignant memoir with a geographic twist.  I will read everything else of Fuller's that I can get my hands on.
0425263908|5.0|I was unsure before I started, but once I did I was hooked! I couldn't wait to read the 2nd book!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love this show and now I can watch it when ever I want.  The quality is superb and the acting is too.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|Great book. Gave me a whole insight into the dark side of the pharmaceutical industry. It looks very much like the financial industry. All about money - regardless of any integrity. I shouldn't really be that surprised.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This series of books is a joke. I forced myself to get through the first 2. I admire the writer because she is laughing all the way to the bank, but she should never confuse these books as &#34;important&#34; or any form of literature.
030759565X|5.0|The recipes are easy to follow and come out great!  She really gives great instruction and has picked tasty recipes to include in her book.  It is as wonderful as her blog!
0060899220|5.0|I absolutely love Bad boy Anthony Bourdain! He's such a good writer and has such an interesting story to tell. I haven't eaten swordfish since I read this book years ago. No joke!
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This was a great cartoon movie.  The animation is great with a story line that makes since and is even good to adults.  Has a little adult humor that went right over my kids head but they are little.  I recommend this movie for kids and adults alike
B0011UGLK6|4.0|I am one of Lahiri's biggest fans. Her books never fail to evoke a sense of nostalgia (although I'm not Bengali, I am from another part of India but the cultures are similar enough). Her language is simple, very easy to understand, but I feel that it's not so simplistic that it reads like a fifth grade novel. It reads as if life itself was narrating the stories. I have one problem with this book of short stories, which is the same problem every other reviewer reported - the recurring theme of successful Bengali families that are usually loaded and have a 6 feet long list of accomplishments. It's just not possible. She needs to introduce a little more variety with the character's socioeconomic statuses and careers.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was a pleasure to read.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This is a great cartoon movie.  My kids and me both loved this movie.  It is a typical Disney movie, with wholesome entertainment and teaching opportunities, especially in caring about others and helping others before self.  Has a little bit of potty humor in it that little kids will like and adults will laugh at until it comes back at them.
0374525153|5.0|I teach 8th g. English/ Language Arts.  This is one of the best books I have shared with my students.  I would recommend this to any Holocaust educator!
159315724X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and much learned.  I would recommend it to all without hesitation.  Also, would be a great gift.
B0083EW97W|5.0|John Mayer is one of my favorite singer/songwriters. His music touches my heart and soul. Love the songs Queen of California, Shadow Days, Born and Raised, and Walt Grace.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great.<br />Comfortable, light, easily adjustable (notches for visual accuracy).<br /><br />Use them for music, videos and class lectures.<br /><br />Clarity is phenomenal, low's are great.<br /><br />For less than 80 bucks, you will not find a better pair of headphones!
B005FFW46S|5.0|As usual a good read from Terry Pratchett. Adventure and humor abound, and Vimes is in fine form. I enjoyed every word.
B0036T31YY|4.0|I liked the movie but it was confusing and will leave you guessing to the end. The acting was pretty good but the deja vu theme was too unbelieveable. The movie was more like a Groundhog Day Horror movie. Still, fun to watch so grab the popcorn and sit back.
0316789704|5.0|Along with two other books my son, nieces and nephews have been entertained and occupied for extended amounts of time. Very educating as well
1878424319|5.0|This was an excellent book to read. It is very fitting with todays society. It helps you get a grip on your life
0316789798|5.0|Read previous reviews.  Very happy with books and so is my son.  I have practiced as well and we are improving.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I love this cd. So many songs hit home. It has been a long time since I have really liked a cd like this.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Although I enjoyed the book, this is the first time I can honestly say that the movie is better than the book. A quick entertaining read.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game and kind of addicted to it just can't step playing. I enjoy the weekly challenge all my friends love it
B000FIMG68|5.0|But I love the show I know how the show ended pretty cheesy but I haven't watched many episodes and on season 3
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very accurate information on the weather. Easy to use. Clean interface simple when you want it, detailed when you need it.  I like the app.
B007M45PMU|5.0|What an unexpected great album.  Great for just sittin' back with a drink, or throw the album on while you're doing stuff around the house.  If you like a folk type of raw &#34;coffee house&#34; kind of music, this is it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|amazing book. one of the best that nicholas sparks has written. i will defiantly read it again and again. one for keeps
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of fun and plays fair.  They are continually updating the program. Graphics are good with selections for card backs and playing surfaces.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I knew it, that's all I'll say so I don't spoil anything!! Excellent job yet again I'm absolutely flying through this series! Again it's a must read!!
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|listen to this if you like breathing, eating, driving, dancing, vacationing, partying, chilling, working, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc,............................!  Get it!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|The whole family loves everything about this movie.  With our Google TV we love being able to stream it to our theater room with our swamping out media. Digital Copy is great.
B00005AWMF|5.0|This classic The Best of Sade brought back memories; CD arrived in a timely manner, in excellent condition, would definitely recommend to a friend.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I'll be honest... The only reason we rented this is because of Rebel Wilson. We loved her in Bridesmaids and are going to watch Struck by Lightning.<br />This movie was hilarious from opening to close... And even the last quip during the credits left us rolling with laughter. I really wish they would have had more &#34;outtakes&#34; during the credits... One wasn't enough!<br />I can see this not appealing to everyone because of the ages of the characters, the juvenile content and all the singing, but truly this isn't a movie to miss. It's NOT GLEE!
383651723X|5.0|Nice book of Jeanloup Sieff's work. Taschen makes this stuff affordable and in a hefty format. Good overview, looking forward to seeing more of Sieff's photography.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|Why aren't the Scissor Sisters popular in the states? This album fuses elements of Prince with The Black-eyed peas and even Erasure . A great party album!
B007N85POS|4.0|Rio App from amazon is alright, graphics and levels are something different and fun for the kids to play, recommend for road trips as a good distraction
B000N90JGI|5.0|This is really not the type of movie I usually watch, let alone love and watch again and again and again. I'm on my second copy of the DVD (I wore out the first), and still stop to watch it every time I come across it on TV.<br /><br />A light-hearted movie, with a great cast of characters, that's full of laughs and love...you can't help but smile throughout the entire film.<br /><br />A must see!
B003FSTN52|5.0|Season One hooked me.  I was adamant about the title, but the show is an engaging legal drama.  I wonder if men secretly watch this show.
B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|Gone is any remnant of his earlier personas. These intervening years must've been difficult for him, judging by the tone of this release. I stopped buying his work after the Let's Dance disk, so I'm NO EXPERT on his music, but I know what I like and this is NOT it.
0805079076|5.0|O autor destrincha os mecanismos ocultos da formação dos idiomas usando as l&iacute;nguas mais populares, mas tamb&eacute;m deixa claro qual o mecanismo intr&iacute;nseco de todas as outras l&iacute;nguas do planeta. Com uma did&aacute;tica invej&aacute;vel e explicação sucinta com o uso de palavras simples, h&aacute; algo de m&aacute;gico em adentrarmos no mundo de um linguista, e pensarmos por alguns momentos o que &eacute; ser um cientista sem muito material de pesquisa.
145210655X|5.0|Since I saw this book somewhere in San Diego the first time I love, I think that Jefferey's Brown work is awesome and also my son think the same.
0312330537|5.0|Don't let the 900 pages intimidate you. This is by far the best and most amazing book I've read in years! It's engaging from the first page and doesn't disappoint and to think it's an autobiography, what a treat. The characters and the powerful relationships between them are fascinating while submerging oneself into the history of India, Pakistan and Iran world's which we know little about. I will read this book again and again.
1400069807|5.0|This book is less about the three items listed and more about the processed food industry as a whole (with a large focus on Kraft). Each section delves into how the processed food industry uses the three ingredients in their foods with the focus on finding the \\"bliss point\\" the point with the greatest taste satisfaction vs cost.  I already knew some of what he uncovers as I've read a lot of info on processed foods and what goes into them. We think a lot about the unnatural/ chemical ingredients but we never think about the natural ingredients like salt, sugar & fat.<br /><br />One thing I've seen a few reviewers comment on (mainly those who haven't' read the book) is the idea that all of these ingredients are actually good for you in healthy amounts. The author does not dispute that. The point of the book is not that these are BAD in and of themselves, but rather that the processed food companies are using these and other unnatural ingredients in such large amounts that they are dangerous. More importantly, they know that what they are doing is not healthy and is contributing to many of the health issues in America. Their response is basically as long as people are buying their product they will continue to do what they are doing. Their goal is to make money, not nutrition.<br /><br />For those who don't really think about what they eat, this book should be very eye-opening. For those who don't think about what they eat - start thinking!  Just because the FDA approves it or doesn't put limits on it doesn't mean it's safe or that it's safe at any level.  Another great point is that despite having nutrition labels, they mean little when the actual amount consumed is nothing near a serving size.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|Very sturdy, works better for me than a folio. Protects your kindle and keeps it safe in case you accidently drop it.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|Another great release from another great modern-metal band. Can't go wrong with Five Finger Death Punch, it seems. I'm rocking!
B002YCVX5S|5.0|This movie is wonderful, Christopher Waltz earned his Oscar easily with this one.<br />This is the first time I have used Amazon video to watch a movie and I must say I was pretty impressed with it. Had to start/stop it a few times and it does a nice 20-30 sec rewind for you to catch up, which I found useful since it was paused overnight at one point.
B008J34466|3.0|Pink felt that she needed to add explicit lyrics to the majority of the songs, some of the input seems to be an addition after the fact. I am not against the use of this kind of language but in this case I can't seem to understand why it was necessary.<br /><br />Other than that a great album and Pink's great vocals come over really well.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Anna Kendrick has the most awesome smile in Hollywood ;) Pitch Perfect is a really good show that had potential to be a great show if they would have stayed away from the Glee project Ideas
B002UPQ1P6|4.0|If you're a casual Twisted Sister fan and want a \\"best of\\" compilation, this is the one to get. All their hits are on this single CD. This disc will quench your thirst.<br /><br />Twisted Sister was one of the bigger and more well known hair bands of the '80s. They came out with some quality stuff that rocks. They, like so many of the hair bands, didn't have the staying power that a lot of other bands have had over the years, but they made their mark regardless.
B008602KQI|5.0|I liked this movie quite a bit. I was not a bit disappointed. It was GREAT!<br />I want to see  II and III next.<br />Tom
B00000K31Q|5.0|Good movie, and it is different than a lot of movies.  A lot of movies seem to similar, so it is always good to have something different.
0385342039|5.0|This is one of the most fun books I have read in a long time.  I really enjoyed reading it.

B005LAJ23A|5.0|I heard about The Walking Dead series from Halloween event based on the tv series at Universal Studios Hollywood. I saw the previews on the tram and wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Let me tell you- AMAZING series! I purchased First Season and watched it all in one weekend. I knew I was addicted. The Walking Dead Season 2 is just as addicting... if you haven't jumped on the band wagon.... NOW is the time!
B002SRQ214|5.0|I see allot of dual core processors for the same price as this quad core so why not get a quad core. With the AS Rock FX Socket AM3 Plus NVIDIA GeForce 7025 A V GbE Micro ATX Motherboard N68C-GS for only $44.99 on Amazon you can have a fast computer for cheap.

0060873175|1.0|Profoundly terrible.  Terrible premise, with early Star Trek level science, that asks questions it never resolves: if our atoms have shrunk, how do we interact with the regular sized oxygen atoms around us?.  Flat, uninteresting, unbelievable, and annoying characters.  People who die as if they spun a roulette wheel to see whose turn it was to die by ....tripping or pausing.  I am in stunned disbelief that I made it through this trash, which I attribute to having brought nothing else for my plane ride.  I doubt Cricthon wrote more than two sentences.  This Preston guy should not be a writer.<br /><br />NO NO NO NO
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It is emotional, the highs and lows of one young woman's life and how she gains a voice through flowers. Loved this book.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Life stories aren't always happy.  Pi's life is no exception.  It will fill you full of awe at times, but it will show you lows of great trajedy as well.  It is indeed an adventure, mostly of a young boy and young man. As a young boy his life was tormented by his full name, but filled with joy of learning about religion and animals in his families Zoo.  In time his family must sell out and board a freighter with some of their animals.  Trajedy strikes deep on that voyage, but Pi and a tiger survive.  Their adventure on the high seas is indeed full of wonder, but measured with the struggle of finding water and food.  Pi ends up telling us two stories and letting us decide which we like best.  I like the one with the tiger and I think you will too.  Great directing, acting, production values, and absolutely gorgeous camera work.<br /><br />CA Luster
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|I hadn't been following this series on TV until Comcast offered their Watchathon a few weekends ago ... and having heard so much from others about Downton Abbey, I thought I'd give it a try.  I became totally captivated by the characters and world of Downton Abbey.  It's one of those amazing ensemble casts that make you feel like you know each and everyone of them.<br /><br />I can hardly stop watching this series. It's truly rich in history and a study in human nature.  There's so little on TV sometimes - This will nicely fill those evenings when there's &#34;nothing on&#34;.
B00005N5RM|5.0|If your gonna do a remake then this is how it's done. Same premise almost a shapeless organism arrives from space consuming everything in it's path. In the 1958 original the Blob arrives in a meteor from space and is an extraterrestrial. In this great remake the Blob is discovered to be a biological warfare weapon created during the cold war. The ending was cool & creepy. During a tent-meeting church service in a field,Meeker disfigured by his burn injuries, is preaching a doomsday sermon sounding like the Blob's attack. He is asked by a woman about when the time of reckoning will come, Meeker replies \\"Soon... Madame... soon... the Lord will give me a sign.\\" and holds up a glass jar containing a fragment of the Blob, which moves. This is a really terrific film one of the greatest films from the 1980s. It's right up there with other great remakes from the 80s, The Fly 1986, The Thing 1982, The Fly 2 1989(A sequel to the remake but technically a remake of Return of the Fly), Little Shop of Horrors 1986, Invaders from Mars 1986, Earth vs The Spider 2001, King kong vs Godzilla 1962(A remake of King Kong 1933), King Kong 1976, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978. The special effects are great and gruesome.<br />The Blob 1988 get's a 5/5 stars.<br />The disc includes:<br />Main feature<br />languages<br />subtitles<br />Theatrical Trailers<br />Interactive menus<br />&<br />Scene selections

B00123AYNM|3.0|First off, I know Porcupine Tree isn't trying to sound like Tool, I don't expect them too.  I just don't see the comparison some people are making online.  Like any music review, it's all in the ears of the listener.<br /><br />I'm a big Tool, APC, Pucifer fan.  I saw several recommendations that said Porcupine Tree was a somewhat comparable band.  I didn't expect them to be the same...that wouldn't be any good.  But this album is just too laid back for me.  Some songs are OK and the production is really good but I just can't get into it.

B004DEW9L2|4.0|The best part of this film is the pacing. The great editing makes for no slow scenes. I see this film as being more important for the way it tells the story through unique film making than film technique. Godard only used jump cuts to move the narrative along than as a stylistic device ( quoted from Ebert). The jump cuts only seem cool to us now although they were used for a practical sense back then. The film is dynamic, kinetic and a solid piece of work.
B004MPEFBE|1.0|The video doesn't work. Ripoff. And I can't return it as far as I can tell. Very poor app and set up.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|REALLY good game.not as good as slender rising, but still really good. I would easily recommend this game to any slender fan.
0307352153|4.0|The author provides many examples of how Introverts live differently in our world and the challenges we face because of our temperment.<br />It validated me to understand why I feel I don't fit in as I might wish I did, at times.<br />Being an Introvert is Who I am. This book helped me understand my uniqueness and the contributions I offer because of my introvert nature. It's less about feeling weird or different and more about learning how I operate and why.
6305128952|4.0|I actually appreciated the fact that liberties were taken with the ending of the movie as opposed to the ending of the book. It is actually a beautiful movie from every aspect. Cinemetography is outstanding.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|While I enjoyed reading this book for the most part WHILE I was reading, I walked away more than a little disappointed. It is entertaining, but had me sighing out loud at the writing style. I can't believe how many times the same 30(and I'm being very generous here) phrases were used. I get that it is *supposed* to be a story about dark, carnal sex, but it was so repetitive that I got bored at times throughout. I could come up with more ways to describe an orgasm to my girl friends than has been written in this entire book. And I don't have girl friends. If I had to hear her refer to her vagina as 'my sex' one more time, I might have thrown up. For a novel as kinky as this one was *supposed* to be, forgive my French, but I could have stood to hear the word p*ssy at least once. I don't understand what was so kinky about this book anyway. When you're introduced to his 'red room of pain' SO many things are described that never get used or even mentioned again. I remember being at 70% and thinking holy s***, where has the book gone? So little had happened at that point that I thought SURELY they're gonna get really dirty, really intense from this point on. But it doesn't. There were plenty of times that I wished she hadn't been a virgin before him. How unrealistically naive that a senior in college is 1) a virgin, and 2) eager to jump into that kind of relationship as one. I'm sorry, but a 22 year old smart, 'sexy', witty girl who has a likeable personality and in the midst of graduating college would NOT be a virgin 'because no one has noticed her' because of her awkwardness or clumsiness or whatever. Gag me. I was plenty awkward, clumsy, and all those other things and I never got looked over to that extent. If she's gonna attract the most perfectly beautiful man on earth, give me a little believability. Why was the virginity even necessary? I could have predicted the way that would have ended. At least make her purity about religion, or holding out for someone committed to her, or whatever. You try to tell me that there's ANY woman her age who is a virgin solely because of being less beautiful and confident than her perfect best friend, I'm not going to believe you! There's something wrong with her. I would have enjoyed the book twice as much if going into that relationship she was sexually confident, self assured, and sure that no man could teach her anything about sex, only to be humbled by how little she really knew. Then maybe I could have tolerated her 'smart mouth' (that seemed to come out of nowhere). I kept having to remind myself that she was 22ish, not 15ish. Grow the hell up! If a man tells you upfront how cold and distant he will be, no self respecting woman is wasting her time trying to change him. Trying to sneak deeply personal/painful information out of him in a relationship so based on sex that there is a written contract involved. Just frustrated me to no end. I would recommend this to teenage girls and grandmother's looking to secretly get their kicks in bed at night. Not to 21-22 year olds with 'vanilla sex' lives that are more erotic and exciting than every page in this book like myself. A very good book to look forward to this age, and a very good book to look back on this age, but a terrible book to relate to at this age. Life is a hundred times more exciting than the action and the characters in this book, and I have a pretty run of the mill life.
0061537969|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a full-circle tale.  Enzo is an astute, caring dog who has learned much about people from watching television.  In spite of that, he is content to face his last days with the hope of someday being re-incarnated as a racing driver.  He does all he can--and it's enough--to help those he loves.

8186336141|3.0|This is a fantastic book, despite the physical quality.  As a yoga student and teacher, I find it easy to use and a must-have reference.  Unfortunately the paper quality isn't the best - it's old school yellow pages and the text and illustrations are faded in lots of areas although it's a brand new book.  The book is also so thick that to read a section towards the back, the binding snapped and now whole sections are falling out.  I've only been using this copy for 2 weeks!  I can't imagine how it'll hold up over time if it's already falling apart.  I recommend finding a quality version and adding it to your must-have yoga collection.

0684857219|5.0|So like life in general, the greatest problem I see now in trying to figure out how to get big is \\"too many choices\\". The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding is comprehensive, thorough, and is written by someone who has been there and done that. While there are always new programs that come out and are the miracle solution to putting on lots of muscle fast, anyone who has actually competed in the sport will tell you that it is primarily learning from mistakes, persistence, and time in that gets you big.<br /><br />So while this is basic, it is also thorough. While you may not find anything on Meadows' Mountain Dog training or Skiploading, that doesn't keep this book from being an important resource. Sure, some of what is written is obviously \\"bro knowledge\\", but who cares? That bro knowledge is at least field tested.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I have always been a fan of uncomfortable comedies. In particular, when the UK Office hit the airwaves I was always flabbergasted at how surreal it was to watch actors portray people and situations I experienced every day at the workplace. For lifelong IT workers, we now have a better resource - scratch that - bible, to describe our every day interactions. The Phoenix Project brilliantly described the life of IT workers. Being taken for granted, irrationally blamed for all mistakes, yet still being the underpinning for every business project can lead to a life of burnout, frustration, and overall disgruntledness. I am not one to believe in things like \\"The Secret\\", but if there ever was one for IT, it would be The Phoenix Project. I knew all of the characters in the book, and experienced all of the problems (We even went through a SAN failure the same day I started reading the book - PRICELESS!). In total, I spent 3 days burning through the book. I honestly could not put it down. More importantly, it shed an entirely new light on how IT works and how it doesn't. This book will change your entire mindset on how to succeed in IT.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|I don't remember how much I paid for the 8-film collection of Harry Potter, but they have entertained my 3 grandchildren-9, 6 and 4 years old and several adults at least 4 times for each movie.

Now, I find that I love to watch the magical ways performed in the movies.

B0048LPRD2|5.0|Nope, this film isn't for everyone... but think about the type if film that is \\"for everyone\\" and you find yourself watching \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"<br /><br />The opening credits are loud, weird and in your face; The opening scene is a kid (Oscar) smoking DMT. So this film will probably interest psychonauts, or those who like interesting psychedelic looking films.<br /><br />The story is about the relation between life, death, DMT, and the Tibetian Book of the Dead. After Oscar smokes the stuff, we hear one of his friends tell him that DMT exists in the brain, and is released at the time of death (which is true). So he's implying that death will be something like the groovy stuff he just smoked. Then he tells him about the Book of the Dead, which is sort of like a what-to-expect after you die book.<br /><br />All this is convenient, because the kid gets killed that night, and does in fact go on a journey a whole lot like where he went after smoking the DMT earlier. He floats above himself, through the past, watches his sister... and uses his friend's advice from the Book of the Dead.<br /><br />The film is long, but I was digging the psychedelic float through Tokyo's underground. There is very much a plot and a story here... but it hangs on listening carefully to what is said in the beginning-- especially by the French junkie guy. It isn't your typical cops & robbers or romance plot, but it's there if you look for it.
0307352145|5.0|Finally, a book that says its okay to observe rather than participate, read by yourself in a corner rather than engage with others, and have a few close friends rather than 100s of them. Thank you, Susan Cain, for sharing your journey and for documenting the research that studies introverts and their contributions to the social fabric of life in the Western world.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I am new to the work of Richard Armitage, but his talent really draws you in. I love the fact that the characters are not one-dimensional. Everyone has their flaws and their virtues. It makes the relationships a little more realistic. Mrs. Thornton, for example, could easily be played as a crusty, bitter old woman, and nothing more. But some of my favorite scenes are the ones where she is speaking privately with her son, because you get to see how deeply her affections run, though hard times have made her a little prickly. I have not read the book, so can offer no comparison. But the adaptation is worth seeing if you're a fan of literature.

B009JBZH54|4.0|I waned each of these movies individually and the collector's edition of both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. However, this set was packaged perfectly well. The special features were worth the set in my opinion. Concept art, complete commentary, etc. Very happy with this purchase. I do think it could have been packaged with something like one of the comic tie-ins, a small collectible or something of the sort as the previously mentioned sets were. For that 4 stars.<br /><br />Ultimately, each movie is a 5-star flick and well worth the time to watch and experience. Nolan is a master with Batman and I will truly miss his influence on my all-time favorite hero.

B000FBJFSC|1.0|I read this book several years ago and was very disappointed in it.  Having read so many glowing reviews, I was surprised that I disliked it so much. The author wants us to understand the Irish Catholic experience, but I believe that his miserable childhood was the result of hard economic conditions, a neer-do-well father (probably mentally ill, definitely a severe alcoholic) and a mother who had to put up with multiple pregnancies before the time of birth control. With so many children, she was unable to work even if she had had a decent education, there were no job opportunities for women at that point in time.  To me, this story of grinding poverty, malnutrition, death from starvation, and it could describe families in any number of countries or time periods. Before our modern era when women could function as breadwinners, if a father did not supply the family with sufficient resources to have a decent house, clothing and food, they had to depend on the extended family, or they starved to death.  This story does a good job of showing the reality of being so poor that children die from malnutrition. I believe that the father in this family was mentally ill and was unable to shoulder to burdens and responsibilities for the children he produced so he just left, but the fact that he was an incompetent adult had enormous consequencies for his family. Again, I don't think this story was unique to Ireland in any way, but it probably is descriptive of many poor families in communities that preach against birth control. It has a message for politicians in America who want to cut services for the poor (especially birth control) and simply tell them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

0061950726|4.0|Due to my recent interest in \\"Orphan Trains\\", I have been reading non-fiction and fiction about this \\"American experience\\" (in fact, I ordered a DVD on the subject). This was a good book, although I have not been able to figure out why the orphan gave her own daughter up, later in the story, when there was no compelling reason to do so (at least not security or finance-wise). A nit-pick, but something that drives me nuts...why does the cover show a young girl looking though the compartment door window of a EUROPEAN train?
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Awesome movie! I enjoyed this movie very much, and I m very pleased with this puchase. I would definitely recommend watching it! Just remember this is not Disney's version of Snow White. Great movie!
B008O9V4C2|3.0|Not Mr. Fagens best solo work, but a solid effort, and backed by some talented players who are new to me.

6305003882|5.0|Not kid friendly but I made my son watch it so he could see just how easy it is to fall into a life of drugs and how it can hurt you as well as others. I would not suggest you letting kids watch it until you have seen it but it kept me drug free as a kid. One of Leonardo's first works!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Cannot say enough about this CD. This is one of Justin's most personal works. Each song brings you in a little deeper. Musically Spirits of the Western Sky lays bare the intimacy of the lyrics. Justin's acoustic guitar work is magical, while his electric guitar was reminiscent of the past and full of ananke in its motion. Francis Gavet's recordings of Justin's vocals is simply stunning, it was so real, so alive, like he was right there in the room. There were a couple of special moments on Broken Dream that set it apart from the first release. And Anne Dudley inspires with her orchestrations. Overall this is a beautifully produced CD capturing the love of the muse which is Justin Hayward.

B0083DJWGO|5.0|This is not insipid reading or a hot piece of fiction.  This is a thought provoking, in your face, philosophical treatise that will give you a new view that clarifies some of your earlier thinking.  It is provoking, but we have come to expect that of Mr. Taleb.

B00B99KJR0|3.0|Also a Call of Atlantis addict, I was excited about this game.  I was disappointed that there are fewer strategy tools to win (as in none) and  the timer is so ridiculous. I solve the puzzle in two minutes and get one star? The game board is smaller making it much more difficult to get matches of 4 or more.  I enjoy challenge but aspects of this game are just annoyingly defeating.

B00095NX9G|5.0|I would like to say first that the yoga on this 2 DVD set alone is worth it. Brice includes 3 different yoga sessions. First there is a regular yoga practice for belly dance, then she has one specifically to help you with back-bends and then she includes a cool down yoga practice so after you are done exercising you can stretch and cool off. The finishing yoga practice is included on both DVDs so whichever DVD you have been using to practice you don't have to switch disks to go to the cool-down section. Following the yoga included has really improved my sleep a lot. I'm one of those people that normally takes a while to fall to sleep every night and I sometimes suffer from insomnia. But, after a few days of yoga I started noticing that I would fall asleep at night instantly and even if I woke back up in the middle of the night I would still go back to sleep quickly. I think the deep controlled breathing that is taught has been mostly to blame because I find it easier to clear my head at night before going to sleep and just relax and let go of stress and everything that's on my mind. So I haven't had any more sleep problems since I've been doing this yoga nearly every day.<br /><br />Although Brice teaches the tribal fusion style of belly dance anyone wishing to learn any type of belly dancing can benefit from this DVD. This is the first real formal training I've had in belly dance (besides training in floor work). I sat down just to watch Rachel Brice do the drills and isolations a few times and now that I understand what she is doing better I can follow along with her. I like to warm up with her isolation drills and then I move on to dance by myself remembering what I have learned. Knowing the correct posture and the different ways to isolate muscles groups allows me to create my own dance and movements and do my own thing. I don't really follow her choreography but it gives me an idea of how to start doing my own footwork and has helped me feel comfortable in dancing. Of course, I don't dance for anyone else but I love to do it as a work out at home and knowing proper technique helps me get the best results from belly dancing.<br /><br />In the first section of the first DVD she quickly goes through your 10-step dance posture and in every section where she does the drills she makes sure to remind you to stand in 10-point dance posture and she makes sure to exaggerate the way you are supposed to stand that way you will get it (like taking her hands and showing you to lift the ribcage and make sure your lower belly is lifted, etc...)<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of the tribal style. I feel that most of the dancers are a little too overdressed and the set a little too gothic for my taste. But, I love the smooth movements that this style creates. Especially for those dancers who love dancing to music such as Solace knowing how to create smooth movements can help you dance to any style of music. And, of course, what Brice teaches here in this DVD can help you even if you want to dance to traditional style belly dance music or some Egyptian style drums such as Hossam Ramzy as well.<br /><br />Rachel also has a small section where explains the technique to do a beautiful and safe backbend. I found that listening to her explain the technique also helped me do backbends such as the snake movements in floorwork. My backbends look MUCH better now.<br /><br />Now, this DVD can work well for beginners as well as more experienced dancers but it is not your one stop place to learn all there is to know about belly dance. For more serious dancers who wish to be well rounded in all areas you will need more instruction than what this DVD alone can offer you. For instance, Brice does not explain floor work technique (although you do see her go to the floor and do a back bend in the choreography section) and she doesn't go over techniques such as belly flutters. You know, there are just some popular belly dance techniques that she doesn't go over. But, you can take the basics of what she is telling you and add onto it. For instance, she normally has you stand with you feet together hip distance apart- as is standard- for belly dance but you can still take those basic isolations and extend them to say, taking one foot forward and isolating that side of your body doing the lifts and drops. When belly dancing you shouldn't spread your feet out further than hip width apart or you won't be able to work the intended muscles properly and also it doesn't look good if your feet are too far apart (she doesn't say this, but just thought I would throw that in there but she does emphasize that feet should only be hip distance apart in part of her 10-point dance posture).<br /><br />Brice teaches both upper and lower body isolations in her isolation drills section. Also, watching her shimmy drill section I have been able to learn how to follow along with both the primary and secondary beats of the drum. So, say on faster songs I can shimmy and then lift my chest or do rib-cage slides with the slower/in between beat of the music. I find myself belly dancing all over the living room and I get a good work out. Then when I'm done and have brought my heart rate back to normal I use Brice's finishing yoga practice and stretch all of the muscles used.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Even though the series has ended I still love this show, I own many of the seasons on dvd though I still have a couple to buy... It was one of the most captivating shows I have ever seen and un-like all the other soap-opera like shows I have seen these ladies are really great actresses and the laughs, drama, twists and turns will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time! Eventually you will be addicted, I mean if you aren't already that is :)
B005FITIIC|3.0|My husband and I bought this movie for the story line and for the many good actors in it especially Kevin Spacey.  The movie was okay to good but didn't meet our expectations for excitement and suspense overall.  This is a movie I would wait to see on cable instead of buying.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|The only thing that would make this MIC better would be if it were wireless. But, hey; for the price it can't be beat. I received it on time and in great condition. I recommend this seller and product. I plan on using it to make many videos for business.
B003EYVXTQ|3.0|If you are a person who likes drama, action and a story to keep you interested this is not it.  My husband lost interest and left the room and I hung in there hoping it would get better but it didn't for me.  While the acting was good I was hoping for it to get exciting. I would wait to see it on cable.  I still think Jennifer Lawrence is an interesting actress to watch.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|Madonna's &#34;Hard Candy&#34; cd came in great condition.  I still listen to it from time to time but really, there were only a few songs that I liked.  It's missing that Madonna spark.  I think maybe she took too long of break from making music.

While reading the book I felt as though the book plot had been ripped off from something I've read before (I wish I remembered what the name of the book was). If you want to read a new series, and a great one I might add then try &#34;Rangers Apprentice&#34;.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I don't really like soap operas so this movie was a great disappointment for me. I suppose that \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" ruined it for me. TTT was all that \\"Pearl Habor\\" never was. My thought after seeing \\"Pearl\\" was \\"Maybe they should have done 'Guadalcanal' instead\\". That is a great story which has never been done in color or from a General's perspective like they did \\"Midway\\" (not counting documentaries). \\"Pearl\\" did have a few good action scenes but I had to wade through too much boredom to enjoy them very much. I think I'll go watch \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" again. It's out on blu ray now, you know. So will be \\"Midway\\" very soon!
0385474547|4.0|I bought the book used (which is probably the reason for it being late). The book had notes already written inside (which was a bit of a plus), and luckily didn't have any highlighted text. The books plot was amazing, and the main characters journey is one that I can see being made into a movie. A+
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|While the commercials made this movie look hillarious and i loved the dynamic between thses two in Knocked Up buying the unrated version was a huge mistake.<br />This went on for over 2 hours. The first 25 mintues were in fact hillarious and then it just started to cut to random scenes that had little or nothing to do with the plot line. If they were super funny that would have been great but the comedy left a lot to be desired. If you want this movie i suggest you go with the regular version.
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|This is EXACTLY as shown and my grandson loved loved loved it !!  He's a huge Octonauts fan and he jumped for joy when he seen his new gup !!  Thanks
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I bought this as a blind purchase as I did not get around to seeing it in the cinemas.  I was floored.  Entertaining story, good acting, and the 3D was superb - no in you face stuff but real depth to the picture as if you could step into the screen.  There are some forums complaining about the LFE channel being mixed too low, but I didn't really notice as I was totally immersed.  I actually enjoyed this a bit more than LOTR as it didnt have the sooking and whining of Sam and Frodo.  Highly recommended!
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I'm absolutely obsessed with this show and was so pumped when I saw how cheap the DVD for season 1 was. I didn't hesitate to order and once my package arrived I spent the entire weekend watching the episodes. I'll be waiting for the great deals on season 2 once they come out.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|A worthy animated movie, with excellent 3D and great sound. I bought this as a blind purchase but boy it was worth it.  I thought Ralph was going to be hard to like but he ended up being great.  Go TURBO and get this one it is recommended.

B008JFUNYG|4.0|Fans of \\"The Evil Dead\\" franchise have had plenty to keep them entertained: video games, novels, role-playing games, video games, and comics. So it was inevitable that someone would try to remake the film thirty years later. It was just a question of whether or not the original creators (Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, Bruce Campbell) would shepherd its legacy.  Good news: director Fede Alvarez has managed to keep the evil alive.<br /><br />After an establishing scene with an ironic twist, \\"Evil Dead\\" hits all the beats: the cabin, the car (Delta 88 'Royale' Oldsmobile), the demonic book (formerly The Necronomicon but listed only as the Naturum De Montum here). In an inversion of the original plot, our female protagonist is Mia  (Jane Levy), who is visiting the cabin to detox from her addiction to cocaine. Her friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas), brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) are all there to support her and, if necessary, keep her there. Which means that, at least for the first half of the movie, the characters' skepticism over Mia's freak out are justified.<br /><br />What ensues is a reinterpretation of the original's mayhem and gore, complete with angry molesting trees, dismemberment, and copious amounts of bloody vomit. Alvarez manages to take all of the elements from the original and refract them through the cracked lens of an experienced filmmaker.  The madcap insanity is muted in favor of intermittent spurts of violence accompanied by the sound of air raid sirens. Although there's no disgusting scene \\"Evil Dead\\" isn't willing to show on screen, it's what happens off screen that is so much more effective.  The aforementioned book acts as a narrator, using crudely sketched drawings to outline what's coming - and then Alvarez delivers with a litany of horrifying sounds when the screen goes dark. Occasionally, there's no sound at all, and that's just as terrifying.<br /><br />There is a frequent back-and-forth between David and Eric as to whether or not the events they are witnessing are supernatural.  David, the guilt-wrenched brother who avoided his mother's death as she succumbed to insanity, argues that Mia is infected by some disease.  Eric points to the demonic book, demonic possession, and demonic everything else as evidence that something is not right in the cabin. Eventually, even David has to admit that something is seriously wrong with Mia that science can't explain.<br /><br />\\"Evil Dead\\" prefers to sacrifice logic in favor of horror on more than one occasion. Mia crashes a car in her frenzied attempt to escape, but the missing vehicle is never mentioned.  The \\"rules\\" of demonic possession are held inviolate, which is odd since they're laid out by the same book that created the problem in the first place.  And Eric becomes a punching bag plot device who keeps rescuing his fellow idiots when he should have succumbed to his injuries.<br /><br />Fans looking for Raimi's trademark slapstick will be disappointed - that didn't show up until \\"Evil Dead II.\\" But for those of us who can remember the ickiness of the original, this incarnation more than lives up to its predecessor. Stay to the end of the credits -- you won't be disappointed!t back-and-forth between David and Eric as to whether or not the events they are witnessing are supernatural.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Book club book.  Great writing.  I definitely wanted to get to the end to find out how it would end, so she kept me guessin.  I was worn out, however, about the very sad characters.  Became drawn out and a bit depressing.  I would hate to have anything to do with Amy and Nick, which means that the author definitely brought them to life.  Liked the twists and turns.  I would read more or her work.
B007REV4YI|5.0|James is really evolving into the Bond that we know and love.  I like the edginess of this Bond version, but he finally showed a tender side at the end.  In this episode, we are introduced to a Bond regular for the first time.

B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This movie just seemed to have left something out.  The finish wasn't really a finish.  Left too many questions unanswered.  I thought the entire culture would change, but I guess that happens in HG II?
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Another GREAT Pendergast mystery thriller. I've been a fan of these guys for a long time. They always have wonderful stories and characters. They are both great authors together, as well as in their own right. If you have never read their novels I recommend them highly. Your in for a treat.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is seriously a genius with words; in my humble opinion, a wizard who can break my heart and mend it back together with just the flow of her writing on the page. The manner in which she spins her stories captivate me. Her heroines and heroes pull me in, capture my breath and hold me there until the very end when I am able to slow my heart rate back to normal and breathe again. Colleen was my second introduction into the world of indie authors. For me she is one of those authors who the minute I see a new book title I NEED it, I don't even truly care what the book is about because I know that I will be faithfully taken on a journey filled with passion, intensity, tragedy, and intense love. Everything I adore about her books will be there when I open the book and begin turning the pages.<br /><br />\\"It's killing me baby because I don't want you to go another day without knowing how I feel about you. And I'm not ready to tell you I'm in love with you, because I'm not. Not yet. But whatever this is I'm feeling--it's so much more than just like. It's so much more. And for the past few weeks I've been trying to figure it out. I've been trying to figure out why there isn't some other word to describe it. I want to tell you exactly how I feel but there isn't a single goddamned word in the entire dictionary that can describe this point between liking you and loving you, but I need that word. I need it because I need you to hear me say it.\\" (quote from e-version)<br /><br />Hopeless was not an exception. I found myself so engrossed and emotionally invested in Holder and Sky; their story is so beautifully tragic and brilliant. My emotions ran the course with theirs. I felt their pain, their happiness, their love, and at times their defeat. My heart broke right along with theirs, it shattered as secrets began to unravel and all I could think was no please tell me it isn't going where I think it is. Then there were the moments when my heart absolutely melted at thesweet intimacy that flowed so effortlessly between them, (I felt there were more of these moments then the heart breaking ones) and I couldn't seem to stop smiling.<br /><br />\\"Sky, if you're wondering if I have commitment issues, the answer is no. Someday in the far, far, far away future...like post-college future...when I propose to you...which I will be doing one day because you aren't getting rid of me...I won't be marrying you with the hope that our marriage will work out. When you become mine, it'll be a forever thing. I've told you before that the only thing that matters to me with you are the forevers, and I mean that.\\" (quote from e-version)<br /><br />Dean Holder is amazing, and I mean amazing. At times I almost forgot he's only 18-years-old. His personality and actions gave me the impression of an old soul. Maybe this was due to the hand in life he was dealt. Holder was strong, he was passionate, and he was so damn gentle with Sky at times, almost as though he was waiting for the moment she broke. Our hero was damaged, there was no doubt about that. He suffered through not one but two tragedies, so by the time he met Sky he had already lived one hell of a hard knock life.<br /><br />Sky is empty inside. She makes out with boys, but in all honesty she doesn't feel with them. Boys are a way to pass away the time, a way to try and make herself feel something (that is until she comes face to face with Holder). She fascinated me. Collen built Sky to portray strength, heartache, passion, loyalty, and emptiness. Sky was sassy, she had backbone and she had some pretty amazing friends. All of this together made Sky feel so real to me, it made her so beautifully lost and broken, even if she didn't realize it at first. She hadn't know anything else in life except for love, so why was she so empty when it came to intimacy? Her growth in this book as she learned of her past blew me away. Her decisions throughout the story and the way she handled herself showed her inner strength and moral character. It was refreshing to see a female character written with such maturity and strength. Even though Sky was 17, her character was wise beyond her years. Seriously, she is one of my favorite heroines.<br /><br />\\"And while I could sit here and feel sorry for myself, wondering why all of this happened to me..I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to wish for a perfect life. The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down. I'm choosing to stand taller. I'll probably get kicked down a few more times before this life is through with me, but I can guarantee you I'll never stay on the ground.\\" (quote from e-version)<br /><br />Dean scared her, and excited her all at the same time. Sky gave him hope, and a sense of peace that made the darkness he felt for 13 years inside him ease with each passing day. Their relationship and chemistry was off the charts intense; their interactions emotionally raw. As the past began to unravel it's inconceivable secrets, they stood strong and pushed forward. Their love for each other was strong and it was real. I loved the time Holder took to be gentle and careful with Sky. He wasn't afraid to show her how much she meant to him, his actions sometimes spoke louder than his words. Towards the end, when it all blew to hell Sky totally blew me away with her strength, she pushed her own pain and heartache aside and focused on Holder. She offered everything she had within her to protect him and show him how much her love was for him. She placed his feelings above her own, and in return he did the same. I adored them individually and as a couple, I adored the fact that even at such a young age they knew their relationship was something special, and I adored the way they protected their love of each other the most.<br /><br />\\"He's proven to me that I'll never feel completely hopeless again, so long as he's in my life.\\"<br />(quote from e-version)<br /><br />Sky and Holder didn't just love each other, they lived each other.<br /><br />Thank you to NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review Hopeless in exchange for an honest opinion.
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|A few observations from an old fan who saw ED back in its heyday...<br /><br />The upshot: horror aficionados are in for one of the most ridiculously bloody movies I can recall in recent yrs, and from what I gather, it's all practical, on-camera FX, and no CGI. So on that basis alone, it deserves a lot of credit.<br /><br />Given the degree of grue in ED, it would've been interesting to be privy to the behind-the-scenes politics involved in the unaccountable-to-the-public, right-wing MPAA to issue ED an \\"R\\" rating when this would have easily scored an \\"X\\" decades back, or an \\"NC17\\" not so long ago.<br /><br />The cast: no one was annoying, and it was fun seeing the Thumbsucker kid as the hippie teacher! ha (I hadn't seen him in anything since). Really, though, most horror movies nowadays, just like the 1980's, have absurdly unrealistic, interchangeable Young People that mostly seem like they're fresh from a Mentos TV commercial. They're not so unbelievable here, even if the audience is, of course, never really given any reason to root for anybody.<br /><br />The absence of an Ash: ha, really, did anyone for a second figure they *wouldn't* use a woman instead? Come on...you need to brush up on Remakes 101<br /><br />The ED remake is basically like most new movies these days in that even though it looks really good, many other aspects fall flat. The older I get the more inclined I am to lend credence to the concept of movies basically being a One Generation art form i.e. every worthwhile tale has already been told for the umpteenth time over, with diminished return from that point on. It needn't be that way, but the business model being what it is...<br /><br />A few gripes:<br /><br />Moviegoers recently saw a widely publicized, washed out looking horror movie poster with a girl wearing a dress and boots in The Last Exorcism. So, sorry to say I thought this promo poster was a lame-o. I haven't a clue as to how their marketing people didn't see such an obvious, recent comparison. Anyway...<br /><br />The homage bits to various details of Raimi's original ED are plentiful, albeit scattershot, often appearing willy-nilly and out of context from how/why they appeared in Raimi's film. Fun stuff to pick out, though.<br /><br />The attempt at establishing exposition at the story's onset felt wholly unnecessary, as if they merely wanted to (1) give the audience a gore blast right from the get-go. And (2), create a different opening from Raimi's film. In my view it would've been more effective to re-create the long drive down the grown-over path leading to the cabin to help create that sense of foreboding present throughout the org ED. The way it's done now reveals the possessed look, and sound, of the characters right away, lessening the shock value once the horror/possessions start getting poured on like motor oil.<br /><br />The whole Book of The Dead theme has taken on an overtly Satanic framework, replete with Baphomet's, and numerous other common/familiar pentagrams and deviltry images that will likely make viewers think of European black metal bands instead of an archaic, ancient tome of esoteric incantations.<br /><br />There's no shortage of the oft relied upon, Trying-To-Have-It-All-Ways-Simultaneously formula, employed ad nauseum about three-quarters of the way through. And the ending didn't work at all for me. It's anyone's guess as to why the film's makers decided to completely abandon Raimi's org ending, which left such an indelible mood of doomed-out horror upon viewers.<br /><br />Another complaint is the dialogue written for the possessed. While it may have been campy at times in the org, here it's just flat-out ineffective. Aside from the recurring \\"I'll swallow your soul,\\" the whole \\"why did you disturb our sleep...?\\" bit is gone, as is the infamous childlike, sing-song taunting, \\"we're gonna get you, we're gonna get you,\\" which is odd given that it plays prominently in the new trailer.<br /><br />While it may sound like this is a negative leaning review, I actually would recommend this remake, especially to long time fans of the series. It's not without its high points, even if much of it feels predictable for those of us who've been around the block a few times. Say what you will regarding comparisons, it doesn't change the fact that ED 2013 is definitely a dose of genuine horror.<br /><br />The problem is, the org ED, like countless other pop culture examples, stood out and made such a lasting impact in its own time/era for a host of reasons that simply cannot be duplicated for what should be obvious reasons. Trying to go back and somehow recapture the uncapturable doesn't yields the same results.ike this is a negative leaning review, I actually would recommend this remake, especially to long time fans of the series.

B007MCTTHY|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It is enough mixture of puzzle and logic to keep me entertained and my 5-yr old even enjoys playing the easier levels. There are some levels that do &#34;seem impossible to solve&#34; (as stated by a previous reviewer), but then the answer comes to us and we move on. The reason I do not give this 5-stars is that it is difficult to tell where you stopped off and there are limited instructions for the levels. Also, if you get stuck on a level, there is no way to move until you figure out.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I was expecting a romantic drama.  Instead, I ended up feeling like I had taken LSD.  The movie was really hard to follow.  It was artsy, subjective, and play-like.  All the scenes take place in this auditorium that gets choreographically changed suddenly and randomly to a completely different setting and time frame.  Nothing really happens in the movie; instead, general emotions are portrayed in a weird dream-like fashion.  You can never tell what was actually happening or what was being fantasized by the characters.  Perhaps both or neither...I'm still not really sure.  All in all, it seemed like one really long and disturbing interpretive dance or just a really bad dream. The main character, Anna, was an immature psycho and the movie was generally overly dramatic, depressing, and just plain weird....
0375842209|5.0|Oh boy, the tears poured with this one!<br />What a great story! I really loved this title. This book was a light, flowing read, and yet it was the kind of book that touched me inside and kept me thinking of the story throughout the day! I found myself remembering scenes from the book and trying to remember which movie the scene I had playing in my head came from, to recall that it actually was part of \\"The Book Thief\\".<br /><br />I appreciated that the book painted a picture of probably a very normal household in the second world war. The empathy, sympathy and the human-kindness that was alive and well and bursting to the surface, quietly of its' own accord, made me feel for each and every character in the book.<br /><br />All in all a great read. I would definitely recommend it and not just to young adults.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love the recipes and creative ideas. . lots of wonderful things for parents and grand parents to do with kids. .
B00845PT18|1.0|Whomever came up with this parody of a story should be whacked upside the head and given the FIRST Ghost Rider to watch! I mean seriously, this is a farce, a terrible following to the predesessor movie. Nick Cage... I can't say much about his role. I've seen him in others and he was great! But honestly... this is 21st century computer graphics at a cheap, unforgivable low.<br /><br />I mean, if you really look at how Ghost Rider acted in the beginning of the first movie, you'd see he had some sort of consciousness between what was good and what was evil. Not some psychotic breakdown!<br /><br />That's just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />Take it from me and save your TIME and MONEY. I pray that if they decide to make a second attempt to cover up this eyesore, it had better be a damn good writer and director.

B0073U2FB2|1.0|I do not like the darkes hour movie because it said G-d-amn too much that offended God too much.  I gave an F grade.  SUCK!
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|First thing first: I didn't watch the Bluray. There, I said it.<br />But let's start with the movie itself. It is an excellent flick. Not to be confused with his earlier movies which were as close to being work of a genius as a director can make. This one - not so much. Still - good work. After watching it in a theater I promised myself I would get it as soon as it comes out on Bluray.<br />That day comes a few months later. I wait until the $49 price for the 4 disc set comes down to a more reasonable number. Two months later it happens - $29. I drive to a local BB store and unknowingly purchase my ticket to hell.<br />The descend starts as soon as I press Play. Nothing. Dead silence. Usually, there is a chapter selection, special features, etc. Not with Prometheus. After 7 minutes of spinning the disk flashes a 4 seconds panning shot of the 20th Century Fox logo (BTW, is it just me or is this a really terrible name for a company?), then screen goes blank.<br />My first thought is that BD player broke down. But my BD player (as a matter of fact the entire home theater) is from the Pioneer Elite lineup. Not exactly the cheapest. So, I patiently wait for it to load. At 9PM I give up.<br />The next morning I remember that I left the disk in the player. The player froze. It does not respond to Stop, Play, anything. I reconnected the power cord. Same story. Fox logo, then bupcis.<br />I try other discs from the same set. The DVD is fine, special features Bluray - no problem. The player is 3D but TV isn't, so I have no idea if the 3D disc works. It tells me that my TV isn't 3D (it senses that through HDMI!) so I can go suck an egg. This is expected.<br />I go a little further and test other Bluray disks in my collection. Some of them are even newer releases than Prometheus. All others work fine.<br />I drive back to the store. No refund, says the clerk. I patiently explain that I want to exchange. She grabs the case and shows me that it loads fine on a BB in-store player.I am embarrassed. After a long drive home i test the replacement Bluray. Still no luck. \\"$29 to watch Fox logo spin and hear some trumpets? Some deal!\\" I thought to myself. I am convinced at this point that it is the disc that is defective, not my $900 Elite BD player. But why does it work in BB store and quits as soon as I get home? After a few hours it strikes me like a thunderbolt. I drive back to the store and this time I make sure the clerk (a different one) picks the Bluray, not the DVD. Finally - the logo, then silence. They have the same problem too! The previous clerk tested the DVD. This clerk reluctantly gives me yet another 4 disk set. I drive (or, rather, race) home. Same problem again, with the replacement Bluray. At this point I am not annoyed anymore. I am seriously considering that my BD player is cursed. It is a different state of mind I cannot describe. My wife looks at me from a safe distance and asks me if I am OK. How am I supposed to answer?<br />I hit the Internet. Search \\"prometheus bluray defect\\" and you will see what I saw. There are thousands of people who went through the same problem I did. It is all because of bad batch (or several). Some of the forum users tell me how to take care of the problem. I follow only some of their suggestions:<br />1) Update firmware on Bluray player<br />2) Recycle power on Bluray player.<br />3) Reset Bluray player to factory default settings<br />4) Buy Bluray player head cleaning disk with special cleaning liquid ($15.99)<br />5) Buy Bluray disk cleaning kit ($24.99)<br />6) Buy latest HDMI cable with some special insulation and network capability ($60)<br />7) Erase memory from Bluray USB drive<br />8) Disconnect network cable from Bluray player<br />9) Disable network access on Bluray player (couldn't do it, no idea how!)<br />10) Reset network access on player (same as above)<br />11) Make sure Bluray player is set to NTSC and not PAL/SECAM or MESECAM (don't ask what all this means, could be gibberish for all I know)<br />12) Spray Bluray player insides with a dust cleaning pressurized can<br />13) Take the disk out, disconnect all cables and gently shake Bluray player (I made sure nobody saw me do this)<br />In a few more hours by descend to hell goes into overdrive. I am completely unable to accomplish any task other than breathing and thinking about Prometheus. The body rejects any position - standing, sitting or laying down is impossible. I grimly drive back to BB store. Inside the store I for some reason feel like I stole something. The loss prevention guy looks at me the wrong way, the clerks are a bit apprehensive, the cameras are following my each step. Paranoia starts to set in, of course.<br />The clerk takes the set and calls duty manager. The manager listens to her whispering while gently smiling at me. They both find a Geek Squad guy who approaches me and asks if I ever used any of the digital copies of the movie. I ask him what they are. He explains. I reply that I have a multi-thousand dollars home theater. Top of the line. Creme of the crop. King of the hill. Why would I keep getting multiple digital copies of the same movie which I cannot even watch on my premium home theater (just on my laptop)? At this point I am convinced that they are convinced that I am just stealing multiple digital copies of the same movie and re-watching them all over again on a tiny screen.<br />I show them a hundred pre-printed pages of web forums which describe the manufacturing defect in detail. The Geek Squad guy is now 100% is on my side, but BB store manager... Not so much. He suggests I call Fox and request an exchange. At this point I lose my temper. \\"Look\\", I say. \\"All I wanted to do is to watch bloody Prometheus on Bluray. I paid you the 30 bucks, on top of that I spent $100 on cleaning equipment and cables I don't need, $20 on gas driving back and forth! I have not eaten or slept for two days...\\"<br />The manager takes pity on me. In violation of store policy he gives me a hundred percent refund and even pulls all other copies off the shelves since there was no way to know which disks work and which are defective.<br />At home my obsession with watching Prometheus right this instant gets the better of me. I decide to download a free copy of Prometheus off the P2P network. Actually I download two different versions within 4 hours. One is 3D and looks like two identical video feeds split horizontally on my 2D TV. The other one has a perfect crystal clear 1080p picture, but soundtrack is in Ukrainian. I fall asleep to the Ukrainian Prometheus.<br />In the morning my descend to hell completes. I reach rock bottom. The ancient gods of Bluray decide to give me a break. DirectTV HD broadcasts the movie (1080p, Dolby Digital soundtrack, perfectly watchable). I record it twice for some reason (don't ask). More than that, the same morning BB store decreases the price of 4 disk set from $29 to $19. Of course, that make no difference to me. $19 for a fair chance to view Fox logo, hear fanfare and drums is still a tall order.<br />Do I blame Ridley Scott for my adventure? Absolutely not. He didn't press these defective copies in some rundown Bluray factory in Malaysia. Do I blame Fox? Definitely. There are so many fans of this wonderful director that feel deceived by this substandard product... It is a crime not to enforce reasonable quality assurance process (testing every 10th or 100th disk for defects) to cut costs. It is a treachery. I am glad that only some of fans experienced this descend into the ninth circle of hell.<br />Only one question remains. Should I keep buying other sets (perhaps used ones) until I find a copy that works? As a die hard Ridley Scott fan I definitely should - considering the plethora of extra features and commentary it offers. But I would rather wait till it reaches what it is actually worth, about $9 per 4 disk set.<br />PS. Here is a pres release from Fox 20th Century:<br />\\"In other news today, anumber of readers are reporting problems with Fox's Prometheus Blu-ray. Throughout the second half of the film, some copies are plagued with macro-blocking and will occasionally cause players to simply shut down. It appears to be a manufacturing error and isn't affecting all copies, so if you're having trouble we recommend you exchange it with your retailer. You can also contact Fox Customer Care at 1-888-223-4369.\\"<br />PPS. 4/23/2013 - contacted Fox. Rude person says \\"we have no reports of problems with this disk\\". My statement that I did not call to find out if there are previous problems, I am reporting one. The Fox lady is determined to convince me that since there \\"have not been any problems\\" (which contradicts their own PR release which acknowledges the problem) I must not have a problem as well. Still, she agreed to replace my Bluray within 4 weeks. I call Pioneer support to discuss a possible issue with my BD player. Their response is \\"this particular BD player has some Java code which makes it incompatible to play this particular title, firmware update is not available yet\\". So, I am increasing my rating from 2 to 3. Disk manufacturers have to make sure it is compatible with all players on the market.

1451695195|3.0|This book covered a lot more medical and technical aspects of Dr. Alexander's condition than I expected and even though it was interesting to read, I was expecting more of an explanation as to what he actually remembered when he was &#34;on the other side&#34; of consciousness.  The part about his real sister being his angel was touching but he never talked about any other people who had died before him or any other people at all that he recognized in heaven.  So that was kind of disturbing to me.  Maybe that says that you start over when you die and you don't really meet up with your earthly family ever again.  Which I guess is all the more reason to appreciate who is in your life now because you may never see them again when you die.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|I've been following Mr. Kaufmann's career for the last several years.  What a great voice!!!!  Although, he sings<br />the lighter roles and is starting to sing the heavy Wagner roles, I can't wait until he tackles Tristan, Siegfried and<br />Gotterdammerung.  Since he is an intelligent person I hope that he will sings those roles - but only when he is<br />truly able to sing them properly and not rush into singing them because of the money.  Too many voices have<br />been ruined by not having good old common sense.  Mr. Kaufmann has been blessed with a voice that only<br />comes infrequently in the world of opera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000Y7U98C|4.0|The premise is simple: a crew is piloting a space vessel that carries a payload designed to re-energize the dying sun. As with many space thrillers, they encounter much more than they bargained for.<br /><br />The special effects are beautiful and awe-inspiring. For fans of hard sci-fi, this one should be on the &#34;to watch&#34; list.<br /><br />Spoliers below:<br /><br />The story line gets a little shaky near the end. The crew finds the remnants of the previous failed mission, and also &#34;awaken&#34; one of the original crew that has become transformed by the powers of our star. Although this is not completely out of line with the story, the ensuing &#34;run & chase&#34; from this character doesn't add anything spectacular to a film that was standing up on its own.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I was such a Harry Potter fan that I've read all of Rowling's books, including the shorter Potter-related books. When this book came out, I was naturally curious to see what direction Rowling had taken after the sensational success of the Potter series.  This book is very different from Potter.  Whereas every sentence in a Potter book drew you deeper into the magical world of fantasy that Rowling had intricately woven, The Casual Vacancy was a gritty and unflinching glimpse into the reality of some people's lives.  The book is slow to pick up and most of the characters are loathsome and unforgiveably self-absorbed. The only sympathetic characters are the dead Barry Fairbrother, the tragic anti-heroine Krystal and the mostly invisible wallflower Sukvinder. Living in the stiflingly idyllic hamlet of Pagford with a gaggle of contemptuous sociopaths seems a bit like torture.  In the end, I was almost happy that Fairbrother was already dead, that Krystal was finally put out of her misery and hoping that Sukvinder's newly discovered confidence leads her to get out of there as soon as she can.

0446554995|5.0|The final installment on the Helen Pendergast trilogy was a good one.  I've been a fan of these authors for years now and this final installment was a great read.  If you've read and enjoyed the first two in this trilogy you will enjoy this one as well.
B008133MDK|5.0|Everything about this season is just as great as the last season, if not better. The acting is great as usual, and the mysteries are perfectly complex. Totally worth purchasing, because you will go back to revisit each and every episode. Be warned though, once you watch this season, you will be begging for the next season to come!
B007HC3LHS|1.0|This book, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I didn't finish it, I'm not even sure how far I even got into it. I felt that the book was just repeating the same thing over and over again. I realize that the book centers around Cathy who has OCD but I just couldn't get into it.
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Looking for some shorter wires that wern't available in my local brick and mortar stores.  These wires work great and cleaned up the mess behind my tv
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I wish the second and third books were as steamy as the first. I had to really push through this one
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|its an adorable game. the music is catchy &amp; the game is addicting. good game for when I'm laying down &amp; feel like playing a relaxing little game.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Excellent work by Mr. Martin once again. Time after time this man delivers an amazing edition to an already awesome book series. Worth every minute of your quiet reading time.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Love the time period and the overall story line. Caution it is graphic and not suitable for all ages or if your sensitive.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Good short story. As with other King stories it doesn't take much suspension of belief for the plot to work. An anthology of short stories would be even better.
B007712XAU|5.0|I personally love time period stories and if you loose yourself in them as well you will love this story. The 20's is another time period where the human race takes giant leaps in every facet of life. When Mary finds herself in bed with dead man is when I sat up and said okay this story has my attention. Can't wait for the upcoming fourth season.
B0081336FO|5.0|It is nice to watch a show that appreciates the intelligence of the viewer (although Sherlock continuously mocks the average human brain).<br />The conclusion to the season 1 cliffhanger was absolutely brilliant.
0679805273|5.0|I love reading this book to my son.  It reminds me of the wonder each day brings and is a reminder to be our best and aim high.  What could be a better message to convey to our children than that.  Dr Seuss is the best!
1616550414|5.0|This book has it all when it comes to Zelda lore. There is information for all the Zelda games up to Skyward Sword. The illustrations are beautiful and there is a lot of detailed information.
B00B23O96A|3.0|It's a little mellow for my taste and I would probably listen to any of his other CDs first, but I do love Eric's music
B00275EHJG|5.0|Out of the 3 Toy Story movies, this is probably the best. The story line is strong and keeps all audiences (age wise) interested. The animation is unbelievable! When we saw this on the big screen, the detail at the trash dump was impressive. Hard to believe it wasn't real.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Wonderfully creative music by a unique artist. This along with a cup of coffee is the perfect start to my day.
B000WC3864|5.0|The package arrived early and there was no damage to the dvd. This companies addition has everything great special features, interviews and the picture quality is excellent. I can see myself making future purchases from this company.<br /><br />God bless,<br />K.M.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|The tracks were great and it's on PINK VINYL - it doesn't get much better than that! I wish I didn't have to turn the record over after just 3 songs, but being on 2 LPs, it's better sound quality that way..

B007SGM084|5.0|I have heard many conversations regarding this book. There is so much more than the hype. It is a great story filled with excitement.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|Ok, this movie had some quirky moments yet all and all, if you just want to relax and have a great laugh, this is a movie that had a lot of 'belly' laughing moments.  Sometimes you just gotta let it go and enjoy some of the silly humor.  I personally feel that the actors did a great job and McAdams was adorable and pulled off this eccentric personality very well. The opening of the movie did not attract me that much during the first few minutes.  As it developed, however, I was glued to the screen, and rolled with laughter.  I highly recommend this entertaining comedy. Perhaps for the more 'serious' folk, a heavy drama is preferred. I look forward to hearing suggestions about similar comedies like this one.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|finally good clean entertainment that is not over the top on anything but entertainment.  not stupid silly.  not full of naughty sex.  something the whole family can watch.  just not enough of it.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|The whole series thus far has me hooked; totally addicted. The quality of writing, and acting is excellent! I will buy everything AMC produces with John Hamm. Enough said.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|A great start to what I'm sure will be and interesting and riviting series. Can't wait to start the next one.
B009HELT3C|5.0|this movie works with out any problems and the graphics are great in it movie always works with out any problem

B00BTHV05M|5.0|I just love this groups sound! They write catchy songs with great lyrics. I have been a fan for a couple years now and have found several of their songs to be inspiring.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book lays out the typical IT ORG. How departments very rarely talk to each other, things get updated without anyone worrying will it effect other department. Change management sometimes attended, sometimes not. The book is very catching, and it makes you think you are really in the story, and watching the arguments and finger pointing, and then you see the clear way of solving problems, and how to get everyone on board. It's not easy, but some ways are better at getting people to work with each other, than others.<br /><br />Whether in an IT Manager role, or a developer or tech support person, I recommend reading this book.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have benn using yahoo mail for years on my home PC an I like the fact that I can keep using the same the same format. Thanks

B007TKT2SK|4.0|Excellent app for those of you who have math homework and also good for cooks who need to break down ingredients! Only downside; has anyone ever in their life ever seen a calculator with no decimal point. That's why it gets a 4 star instead of 5!

0062238868|5.0|I want to start off by saying that I am very impressed with this man. His love for his country is amazing. This is a very humble man and I look up to him. The sacrifices he made for me and all of us enjoying our freedom in the states is greatly appreciated. I would love to shake your hand and thank you personally. God bless you. Tyler Randall

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I was expecting a film about external conflicts rather than about substance abuse.  Denzel is always worth watching, but this is an average film.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie at the theater, am reading the book, and wanted to add this movie to my collection.  The price at amazon was much cheaper than Walmart and Target.  Excellent value.

B004WMKSH2|5.0|This movie is great!  It's been awhile since I've read the books and I got a little behind on watching the movies.  I love it!  Stayed to the story line.  The more movies the made, the better they got.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I like books about personal journeys.  This one was kind of unusual, with the walls being up until the end.  Maybe it is about the old cliche, everyone has ghosts in their closets.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This rad game is toats cool.. it has become one of my fav games in the whole like universe. I <3 subsurfs !! #luvsubserfs
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Read so many negative reviews about the books I planned never to read them. but then a friend of my husband said wife read it, making it nearly impossibly to avoid reading.<br /><br />No, they are not deep in their content. Yes there are mistakes (grammatical, spelling, etc), but they're not worth looking for ~ don't waste your time looking.<br /><br />I found this set of three books to be the greatest little love story I've read in a long time, and I couldn't put them down.  Read all three in a weekend, but that's me.<br /><br />It didn't add anything we weren't already ummm, 'practicing', so I can't speak to that other than there are so many times I began to just skip them, and move on.<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely recommend the set of three to all of my friends, and my cool mother-in-law.  :)
B003Y74AZ2|1.0|You get what you paid for. Cheap quality, cheap product. It does not protect the phone so pretty much is useless.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|i like it. and I don't like most of my friends. but in this game i can become stronger and win more games.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|it was ok.. some parts were very intriguing but others were very..well.. for black of a better word.. frustrating. The main character was very annoying and talked like a 5 year old. i know he was a little coo coo but people with mental problems just do not talk like that.. or if they do they are certainly not capable of the kind of independent life and deep thoughts that this character has. I havent seen the movie yet because I wanted to read he book first..but from what I hear the characters are not nearly as annoying as they are in the book so at least there's that :)
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I really enjoy match 3games. I like the fact that your building or restoring the Tree of Life. I really wish that we could get cradle of Rome for the kindle fire. anyway,  for this game the graphics and sound is awesome!!!!!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It's a good read. He was a lot like Henry Ford,Thomas Edison, Henry Flagler  very much a prick.But knew how to get what he wanted.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I never thought that I would like this book but then my grandmother made me read the first chapter and I was sucked into the games. When I read the books it feels like Im there. Suzanne Collins is an amazing author.
B004HO6I4W|3.0|I purchased this as a gift. When it arrived it had no sleeve and the shrink wrap was not original. I noticed that the sticker, that should be new, was already opened. The disc plays fine but it definitely was not new. I haven't been able to try the digital copy yet but I read a review that someone wasn't able to use due to it was already used. Buyer beware!
B008Y5OWSO|5.0|It is amazing that this movie continues to inspire such a wide range of opinions, including so many haters.  You don't need me to recap the story or the controversy that accompanies this movie, so let me throw in what I CAN contribute.  First, if you have seen the movie, you have not seen it like Criterion (and Cimino) wants you to see it.  The original always seemed very brown to me, but the colors jump off the screen in this version.  I think it was brown for a reason, and now it is brighter for a reason.  I like it brighter.  Second, if you haven't seen the movie, keep in mind this is FICTION.  Cimino is not telling the story of the Johnson County War.  He is using that event as a starting point to tell a fictional story.  Apparently, some of the reviewers here simply cannot handle that, and instead want some kind of documentary.  That is not Cimino's purpose, and why should it be?  Thirdly, and for me most importantly, on watching this again, years after it was made, I think I get it.  I believe this movie is the last from the 1970s (released in 1980) that chronicles the ills of America and its views towards immigration, capitalism, class, power, wealth, poverty, violence, and so much else, all on the eve of the inauguration of Ronald Reagan and the whole notion of Morning in America.  This movie stands in direct opposition to that.  It was also, I think, released at a critical time in this country, in which the lower and middle classes begin the long slow sustained downward spiral that these classes still suffer from to this day in this country.  Cimino, I believe, saw this, and this sensibility infuses Heaven's Gate with its narrative power.  We don't want to face this. We don't want to imagine this.  So we reject it, and reject much of the art that holds this up to our eyes.  Heaven's Gate does that, in its slowly developing, sprawling narrative structure.<br /><br />If you have not seen Heaven's Gate, you owe it to yourself to see it.  Enter Heaven's Gate with an open mind, and don't let others tell you what you should think about it.

B008220DGE|2.0|Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson of Boogie Nights and starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix you will buy/rent a movie on just those names alone.  Don't.  Phoenix plays a sex starved mentally unstable character that ends up on a cruise ship with Philip Seymour Hoffman as a semi-Tony Robbins type character trying to enhance Phoenix's life.  Their relationship evolves and his craziness slowly subsides allowing for him to have intimate human emotions that were not previously possible-all through the wizardry of Hoffman.  Their relationship is at the center of this film and it's flat out boring.  There is nothing riveting or interesting other than performances by both that are well above average.  Even if the subject matter sounds interesting to you-I can't recommend it.  Possibly if you are studying psychology this might be your thing-but I was not interested in the story or where it was going and even though the characters were colorful I didn't find myself that interested to see where they would go.  If you haven't seen it-save your time and watch Zero Dark Thirty, Life of Pi or Lincoln.  Maybe the entire first and second season of Game of Thrones!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I'm relatively new to puzzle games, but this one caught me attention because I'm a big fan of Cut the Rope. Once again, Zeptolab doesn't disappoint. The simple solutions are easy enough that my 6 year old can enjoy the game. But finding every possible solution was a real challenge. I highly recommend this for puzzle seekers of all ages.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|But...for the price and what you get...it's a great movie to add to your collection. This price won't stay this cheap for long. Get it now.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Its not her writing skills, its the 500 page, 100 character, unfinished story she chose to tell. It might be forgivable if this was her first novel. But it was slow to start and took me 400 pages to care what was happening. And although she alludes to what the future may hold. The ending was blunt and unfulfilling.
B0016492BW|5.0|On Blu-ray? their best movie-for less than a trip to McDonalds? Come on. Buy it already. You can't lose. You can sell it to anyone for this price.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This movie was incredible! It kept me on the edge of my couch the entire time. Just as I think it's slowing down, something happens! It's just SO action packed! Plus Jeremy Renner is awesome, one of my favorite actors!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I stumbled on this multi DVD/movie at my local libray.  I was blown away by the series. I haven't had cable for years, so had missed this on TV.  After watching it, had to own it.  This is another phenomonally wonderful sci-fi series that was ended before it even started.  Great actors, great visuals, great stories, overall production - outstanding.  A  must see for all Castle fans .  Thanks!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It's a crime this book didn't cost more.  It was a suspenseful, humorous, thought provoking adventure that is a pleasure to read.  Definitely add it to your reading list.
1594481717|3.0|While pertinent and chock full of examples, the basic message is not ground breaking or really even unique. And, more troubling, not really personal or useful on an individual basis. At least, that's what I think!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I am very discerning when it comes to TV programing.  I started watching after a couple of seasons had passed and was glad to find a venue where I could view those I had missed in order of the story line.  I enjoy the relationship between all of the characters, but preferred the previous chief over the current chief.
B00A93ENX8|5.0|Counterparts represents a better vehicle with inferior cargo - it is a vast sonic improvement over Roll The Bones and Presto with questionable lyrical content. Given that the views of love and relationships are much more mature and worthwhile than the ones found on their debut album, Counterparts is still one of Rush's weaker albums lyrically-speaking. However, there is no shortage of brilliance that has characterized Rush for four decades.<br /><br />The SACD version of Counterparts is what one would expect from an SACD: high frequencies are cleaner, lower frequencies are punchier, and mid frequencies are unmuddied by the changes.<br /><br />This version of Counterparts contains different mixes of each song. The most pronounced changes are found in Stick It Out, Nobody's Hero, and Everyday Glory. The changes have resulted in longer songs and slightly different arrangements in one or two sections. On the first listen, these changes struck me as unsettling because I am accustomed to listening to the original version of these songs. However, the changes give the listener a different and interesting perspective.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing this album not only for the improved quality of sound, but also for the alternative versions of songs. They are interesting and certainly worth the money.
0062238868|5.0|I haven't finished this book yet. But, I really like it.  Chris tells it like it is in his own county language.  Obviously there's somethings he can't go to into detail, but it's a great book so far.  I'm just sorry we lost a true American hero in Chris.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|All you JT fans this is a must have.  I really apprectiated the maturity he's shown in this album.  It has a nice upbeat tempo with catchy tunes that will have you singing along.  The only way I can describe it would be a feel good experience.

0143122916|5.0|I bought this book (Kindle edition) due to the recent tensions between North Korea, South Korea, and the US. An internet discussion forum tipped me off about Shin's story, so I wanted to learn more.<br /><br />The book is extremely well written, but reader beware: disturbing details abound about beatings, camp conditions, food scarcity, and guard brutality. For the past couple nights since I finished reading, I've felt my dreams colored by the presence of North Koreans and details from the book. I'm sure this will subside with time, but if you have an active imagination and remember your dreams in the morning, you will probably notice the influence that this book has on the subconscious.<br /><br />Shin's story is inspirational, and I hope that his inside knowledge of the camps somehow finally brings an end to them. Despite the sometimes graphic stories about his prison experiences, I could not put it down. Highly recommend with the disclaimer that this book should probably be reserved for mature audiences--probably ages 16 and up.

B004SUDPWI|5.0|Sometimes you hear that a movie is great and you keep thinking... yeah, I bet it is &#34;great for the time&#34; (being 1957). This film is just plain great. I loved the acting, the directing, the plot. It had humor, questions on morals and ethics (both on a large scale and on the individual scale), and fantastic movement for a film from the mid 20th century. Both the wife and I loved it. I highly recommend this movie.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I have recommended it over an over again, and no one has been disappointed yet. Great ending to a great series!
1476733953|5.0|I loved this book (series?) I had thought the dystopian society genre was written out, but nope! I couldn't put it down and can't wait to start the Silo series.  Thanks for the low price!  This is a well-written book with adequate detail without pages of what should come from the reader's imagination.  I was attached to the characters and thinking about them when I wasn't reading it.  Love that!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The Walking Dead season two was another amazing 5 star season with many twist and turns make you guess what the producers will do next for the storylines.  I will give the highlights of the season (some spoilers) for fans of the show or people who have yet to watch the show but wonder about it and might want to buy the show.  The first show shows how family, friends, and people you care about stay together and live on even though walkers all around the area.

On the thrid show you still have the group looking for Sofia and Shane comes back with supplies.  Fourth show they have to close off a well because of walker inside it.  Show Five you have some of the chacters thinking back before the world of walkers, Darrel gets injured and walkers attack him, then Glenn finds a surpise in the barn.  Show Six the truth comes out and Rick finds out his wife is pregant.  Show Seven Glenn tells the group about the barn, Shane takes the guns from Dale and goes to the barn, Rick and group frozen when they see what comes out of the barn,  Rick makes a hard choice and shoots.  One of the actors on True Blood guest stars in a scene in Show Eight.  Show Nine tensions getting bigger between Rick and Shane looks like there is going to be a showdown between the two of them sooner or later.

Then Rick tells the group the truth he has kept secret since season one (to find out you have to buy season two).  Plus Rick tells Laurie the truth about him and Shane, and what Carl did to Shane afterwards.  Great Special Features about the music of the seaon, make up amazing job on that, plus almost 30 minutes of delated scenes to add to the storylines.  Also for myself I enjoy how much they stay close to the comic book overall.  I truly enjoy this show and it's one of my girlfriend's favorite show currently.im with a broken neck.

B008JFUNYG|3.0|This film was the bloodiest thing I've ever seen. That's for sure. A great film for the real gore hounds out there. It takes awhile before the chainsaw makes its appearance, but Alvarez (Director) also shows us how much damage a nail gun can do in the meantime. There's plenty of guts and gore to fill up the ninety minutes in this movie. Most of which, will make you cringe. The special effects in this film were very well done. None of that corny computer-made blood here or obvious CGI like the Final Destination movies. Nor any of that lame red water junk that sometimes shows up in low budget films.<br /><br />In terms of guts gallore, this film can be quite terrifying. Especially if you're the squeamish type. However, that's as terrifying as the film goes. There's really no substance that messes with your mind and keeps you thinking for a few hours afterwards. The character developement is pretty weak and there wasn't really a character that I particularly liked, mainly because they weren't very bright thinkers. None of them can hold a candle to Bruce Campbell's character from the original film. I can't see any of them becoming a hard-core killer of Evil Dead in the upcoming sequels. At times, I felt that this film was more like dark humor than a horror film. People in the theater bursted out laughing when duct tape was used to cover up wounds and *spoiler* when the girlfriend's arm fell off. *End spoiler* A bit of the dialogue was a little cheesy which always takes away from the horror, but my hat off to Levy for being the creepiest demon she could be and added back to it.<br /><br />Also, most of what happens in this film has been seen before, so don't worry about losing sleep at night if you've seen any other blood-filled horror film. The supernatural stuff was sort of limited and I felt the film relied more on extreme violence than suspense. I'm more of the psychological thriller type, so this film was sort of a let-down for me, though it did make me look away afew times. Like I said, pretty bloody movie.<br /><br />Either way, Alvarez does an excellent job of making this his own film. The plot is very easy to follow and it's definitely not a carbon copy of the original. For sure, it can stand alone on its own if the Evil Dead franchise didn't exist. So if you're still wondering whether you should go see it in theaters or wait for it to come out, I'd say it is worth the price of a ticket. While the story may not be the best, I'll admit the visuals are amazing. There's nothing like blood-splatter on a giant silver screen in a dark auditorium.
B005PK1G76|2.0|It seems that the lightweight Chicco CT0.6 stroller (on the wide side in its category!) I have is too narrow to hold the organizer in place between the handle bars. I can't make the thing stay on the right position even with the straps tightened as far as they get. Now the buggy buddy just slides down the bars all the way only to be stopped by the canopy. It also dangles due to the lack of stability, so no way I can trust it with a cup of coffee. I wouldn't bother to return it since it's truly inexpensive; I can still throw in keys and snack packs in it. It would have been more helpful had the Amazon product description been more straightforward with its size limit. It may work fine with a standard-size stroller but be warned if you want to use it on a lightweight stroller.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A very touching, heartbreaking, and inspiring book.  I had a little trouble with the wording until I got used to it. The main characters were so very vulnerable and heartwrenchly  sweet.  The ending was suspenseful I was afraid it would end all wrong and was very glad it did not.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. Especially since there are not that many horse games out there for for horse . Lovers to play. Game play is a little slow and tedious though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing!!! Once I started I could not put it down!! Nicholas Sparks book do that to me though. I would recommend this book to all Nicholas Sparks fans!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great. I couldn't put it down. It was a very emotional story, with strong characters. I loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good game that I have ever played on to this kindle I wish it was better.love ya
B007SGM084|5.0|I love every aspect of these three books. Not much more to say than a must read. Smile and laugh often.
B0000C6K09|4.0|This is a good compilation of Williams' work and is a must have for any of his fans or anyone who enjoys the art of movie soundtracks.
B009K72G8I|5.0|The Clones Wars just kept getting better and better with each season; season 5 was very entertaining and engrossing to the end!
B00BF11STU|1.0|This movie is a bore a minute de-thriller. With such an intriguing subject a much better product could be put forth.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|Don't waste your money. Too simple. Ok for a free game to while away some time but expected more as it cost.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|OK this is subjective, and it's my opinion and I realize that fans of the LOTR trilogy are going to disagree with. But if you read the book before viewing this waste of time film it might help you understand what some of us are trying to saying.<br /><br />It's a wonderful experience when a film stays close to the book that it was taken from. Jackson did a very good job with the Lord of the Rings trilogy but there is so much padding in this film that it's barely recognizable.<br /><br />In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film this film just went off line. The believably in the characters was not there for me in this first part of the Hobbit. Unlike the LOR movies that felt like a family film this film lost my attention making me go back and read the Hobbit again since my memories of the book where that it was a book for all ages and this film felt like a children's movie.<br /><br />Our taste in music art and film is of course subjective, but at this point I'm very disappointed with every release of the Hobbit in film done to this point .<br /><br />I also have to wonder how and why Jackson would take a single book, in fact the shortest book of this series and stretch it into a trilogy. If we are lucky Jackson will do something to rectify this when these three films are released to Blue-Ray and DVD. Something like editing them down to the essence of the book rather than enhancing and already great story.<br /><br /> I've waited for years for a decent film adaptation of this book and after viewing this version, I guess I'll have to keep waiting.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Like getting on a ride and wishing you could get off,but at the end you wanted to get back on.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|This is not your typical PSB's CD, it is more mellow than most and Neil never sounded so good. I completely recommend this CD if you want to listen to Neils vocals if you are expecting a dance CD than this is not for you. Eddie
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Dream like and compelling in the way it was presented. The kids even say through it and it kept their attention and many questions throughout.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I've always liked albom's book and the follows trend.  It's a nice simple and stress free read.  Good insight on Father Time and his quandary and good advise for us to slow down and enjoy the moment!!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|The kids finally got their movie.  They had been annoying me for the last couple of months trying to see it. Well worth the wait.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I have inspired some of my co-workers to take up this game.  The only thing that would make it better was if my two sons were still living close enough so that we might have some &#34;friendly&#34; games together in the same room again.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I waited a long time before I could find this movie anywhere at a price that I thought would not be too high.<br />This was on my list of must see anime.  The artwork is beautiful, and it is a fun story if you enjoy anime.<br />Hayao Miyazaki is probably the most respected anime artists out there.  I collect his movies, and they never<br />disappoint me with the quality that is in them.  I would recommend it for older children as there is violence.<br />If you want to read Roger Ebert's review of the film (It was one of the best in 1999!), then just google it.<br />Here is some of what he said, &#34;Hayao Miyazaki is a great animator, and his &#34;Princess Mononoke&#34; is a great film. Do not allow conventional thoughts about animation to prevent you from seeing it. It tells an epic story set in medieval Japan, at the dawn of the Iron Age, when some men still lived in harmony with nature and others were trying to tame and defeat it. It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order. It is one of the most visually inventive films I have ever seen.&#34;
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|great game, great graphics, and very addictive. even though u might not be good at the beginning, you'll eventually learn so don't quit the game early.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|We LOVE this little game! I'm playing it more than my children are.  Very entertaining wand fun for our entire family. If you purchases gems or coins, make sure you get them.  If not, contact the company and they will help you.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|well it works and sound is pound if youu want to be that way also tell you the weather is going to be like with a count down if how many more hours to go yeah at great awesome app! =)
B000PHX4VA|5.0|What's not to love about the Police? They were pioneers in their genre of music.<br />AND this CD is perfect because it has the group's early hits through the peak of their career.<br />It gives the listener the full journey of the Police's musical evolution!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game, spent way too much time on it but got through nearly 100 games! Love the colors.
0307943232|4.0|I usually like most Grishman books.  This one was interesting.  The reader made it so spellbinding.<br />Great choice.  I did not figure out the ending until the very last.  So, it kept my interest and<br />made driving in my car more enjoyable.  J.D. Jackson was the reader.  Great gift for making<br />the story come alive.
1611761069|3.0|Cornwell frequently has great beginnings but her endings always seem slightly out of joint with everything else.  The tool of recall vs live action to summarize events is becoming a bit stale.<br /><br />Also, I usually love her characters but Kay is behaving in an increasingly rediculous fashion given her intelligence and recent background.  I would rather see fewer stories over time with a bit more of the wonderful interweaving of the story line that brought me to Cornwell in the beginning.  Just sayin'.<br /><br />LEH
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1OM05XRZXFTIQ]]This 4 port USB hub is working great and for the price you can not get better. To add an extra 3 ports to a computer is something so valuable that until you find yourself needing one and not having it, you may not understand how great this item is.<br /><br />The installation was as simple as pushing in the cable. Everything that I have tried has connected within seconds. I am using a Toshiba Qosmio 875 computer on Windows 8.  Also what is nice about this hub is that you can connect it to either a 3.0 or 2.0 USB port.<br /><br />Anker products have been good to me and if it was not for trying their gaming mouse I may never have known about them. If the Mouse and Hub represent the quality of their other products, then I can not wait for what is yet to come.<br /><br />Hope this helps with your decision
B009E3EY4M|5.0|I got it as a gift for Valentine's for my bf and he loved it! Led Zep never disappoints! Definitely recommended!
B007885IJU|5.0|These guys really know what they are doing. There isn't one song I don't like on this record! I highly recommend purchasing it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed the &#34;Holy Bible&#34;. I like the way the system reminders me to read daily. I even deleted on bible app, and downloaded this one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun and amazing! I love how there are updates on the places and characters! So cool
B0072PUC7W|5.0|Armin does what he does best, haunting trance with some stand out tracks that take hold and just wont let go.<br />Excellent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game it is great EVER time you update to get to New place you start in Rome you have to wait to get it update it its better once you update it. Subway Surfers HD
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game is awesome! Bye it bye it! it is my first paid app and it took all day to download but it rocks!
B007MDB71O|5.0|If you haven't yet seen this film, you are missing out! A fantastic tale of epic storytelling and a beacon among the angst-ridden crop of current films.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my hubby.  He is a big fan of Bocelli.  It sounds great and the songs are really special.
0783229526|5.0|...You're missing out and have a void in your life. You probably also haven't seen Pulp Fiction. Reservoir Dogs. Blow... Step your movie-watching game up and buy this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you are a horse lover like me this will be a great game for you! great graphics and awesome quality and unlike other apps it doesn't force you to pay real money.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great series! so great to have a season all on one DVD.Hope we have many more seasons
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Great product for the money and easy to use!  Would recommend to others! You can't go wrong with getting this!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved both seasons.  Great acting with historical background, love stories & humor.<br />Found myself talking about it to others for days after each viewing.
B004G600A4|5.0|The movie is adorable and keeps the kids attention the whole time, so I can clean for a minute!  I got a great deal through this seller and I love the movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Attention all temple run lover's! This game is an awesome updated temple run three (kinda). It has surf boards and places all over will give you different characters and boards.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Movie was in great condition and I love watching it with my 3 year old or putting it on so I can get some cleaning done.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I only have the free version. The jury is still out whether or not a annual subscription is worth it or not. The app as is, does everything I expect it to do and easy to use and retriee.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is not bad.  It's something to play while you're waiting to see the doctor or while the car gets an oil change.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Like having multiple cities I can track as we have kids scattered here and there and can check on weather conditions and forecasts which is especially helpful when planning visits.<br />Refreshing and updating is easy and only takes a few seconds most of the time.
0307474259|4.0|I started the diet based on the recommendation of my doctor. I was skeptical but then he told me to read this book, so I did. I basically read the 1st half then jumped to the appendix to see the diet's instructions. It works. I started on 2/6/2013 and went from 197 lbs to 177 lbs as of yesterday. I still have another 20 lbs to go (as an aside, you know you're really fat when you lose 20 lbs and people still don't notice the weight loss -- basically i have alot more to lose). I did a cholesterol screening at work and the numbers looked good, although I don't know what my lipid counts are - I will find out in a few weeks at my official follow-up visit to the doctor. Gary Taubes arguments make sense and so far my weightloss backs it up, however i will be fully convinced once i get my new blood results after my doc visit. You definitely drop the pounds fast in the beginning, then it starts to plateau and i average about a pound a week. The book is an easy read, you can finish it in about 3 hours. I've done weight watchers and i was actually hungrier doing that diet that this one. Will update in a couple months with my blood results.
B001JNNDE2|5.0|Look, you either love this movie or hate it... I am in the group of people that love it!!!  It is soo random and awesome.  Napoleon and his family are crazy and hilarious.  I love his brother and uncle in the movie.  I wish the romantic side of the story went a little further, but this movie is so awkward that that may have just ruined the movie.  The other movies from these creators is also good, Nacho Libre, and Gentlemen Broncos are also great, especially Broncos.  There are soo many great lines and scenes in this movie.<br /><br />The first time I saw this in the theater, there were about ten people in the audience and I was the only one laughing, but I was laughing hysterically.<br /><br />Rent this first, if you love it BUY IT!!!!  If you don't love it then you suck!<br /><br />Just kidding :)
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is a really fun movie for the family. Based on your typical teenager (albeit very old teenager) coming of age and wanting to explore and find herself. Of course their is romance to go along with it. The monsters are really fun and I think all the actors did a really good job voicing the characters. My husband and I liked the storyline and we watch it by ourselves since we have no kids at home. It is an enjoyable movie.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|I started watching this with my girl friend a few weeks ago.  She is hooked, but I only enjoy it mildly.  She is big in-to fantasy, but I am more in-to sci-fi.  I get confused pretty often watching this, but my GF gets everything that is going on and explains what I miss.  I think my mind just wanders while watching.  The actors are mostly very good.<br /><br />The first few episodes are full of nudity, but it becomes more scarce as the show goes on.  It is kind of annoying to me that all these new HBO and other premium channels are just full of random nudity for no apparent reason, like the gladiator show where everyone breaks in to orgy's all the time.  Anyways, this might not be a show to watch with a parent, but it is cool and has action.  It is definitely not child safe, think of this as an R or NC-17 rating due to nudity and excessive violence and gore.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use it all the time. The buttons are large and easy to press. It has all the basic calculations I need
B004SIP7QC|4.0|I really enjoy this movie.  It is mostly safe for the whole family, definitely has some drama that the kids may not understand.  I recommend this to anyone that loves, fantasy, romance, and drama.  The actors are great, even the kids!  I don't know how much truth there is in the story, but I like to believe that its accurate.  Check it out if you have not seen it.  It may be a rental for you, but its a buy for me :)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The best action packed science book I've read.<br />The book takes you into the dangerous and hostile planet Mars. Our hero, while stranded alone on the surface of the red planet, turns out to be a born survivor. The reader gets extra science points as our hero keeps himself busy working and retains optimism and humor as reality &#34;blow&#34; (literally) in his face .
B003MUOUI8|4.0|This movie is very close to being great.  I like the movie, it has some good drama, but it stays on the surface too much.  The movie is not dark enough, and the character development was not deep enough.  The characters that I knew most at the end of the movie were the security guards, and they are minor characters compared to Mandela and Damon's characters.  It should have told more of the apartheid story, and should have gotten deeper into the racism aspect.  I was happy at the end, however I didn't think it was sad enough.  They get in-to Mandela's sad past a little bit, but they just scratch the surface.  This movie would have been really great if it was about half an hour later and showed more drama and history.  I didn't know anything about apartheid in South Africa until after I read a news article after watching the movie.  Basically I wish the movie was more informative, a lot of people in my age group were not educated about this issue in school.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good cool epic great I recommend this app lots it really good yay fabulous lovely good very fun and addictive love it
B00BESFWBY|3.0|I thought the movie was pretty good, I didn't love it though.  The movie has a lot more drama than you would expect from the trailer.  Both the kid's and Gerard Butler's lives are very dramatic, I was teary eyed a few times during this movie which was unexpected.  The visuals were awesome, it made me want to go out and surf, but then I realized that I'm fat and live in Texas, so its probably not going to happen ;)<br /><br />The movie may not be little kid safe due to subject matter, violence, drugs, alcohol abuse, bad parenting practices, skipping school, language, death of a parent.
034580404X|5.0|I read this because it was all over the news and such.  Was real hard to put down.  Read all three in no time.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett is great as usual, but had a bit of trouble getting into the story.  It was worth the wait and I read it to the end.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great! realistic. it is fun and exciting. wish therr was an easier way to make money and mayne more options on things to do. but It is a great gaame
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie with great acting all around. Movie touches on many themes of modern life. Another outstanding performance by Denzel Washington .
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is classic science fiction and an easy, yet rewarding read.  I couldn't put it down.  Very well written.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|As a Christ follower the derogatory use of the Lord's name was offensive.  Otherwise, this is required reading for anyone in a Dev/Ops career.  This is the kind of forward thinking that IT needs to  continue to evolve into an integrated business enabler in the enterprise.
B008220C56|3.0|After seeing the Netflix version this version did not compare! I LOVED Pride & Prejudice and had high hopes of this movie being as great, but it wasn't. I love period pieces and this movie would have been a great hit if the Broadway-theatrical addition had been left out! As the scenes are changed as though its being done on the stage, it took away the realism of the movie and made it seem corny, I was not pleased and wish I would have rented it before buying it because I probably will never watch it again.<br /><br />Happy to say though, Matthew Macfayden did an AWESOME job in a low production film!
B005GIS1WA|2.0|Thought this was going to be a cute rated G movie to watch with my 6 year old.  The main theme of the movie is that scientists want the last two blue macaws to mate, which leads to tons of sexual innuendo.  Lots of music and sexy club dancing, verbal hints on how to woo a girl with your moves and attitude. it also takes place in rio durning carnival (think Mardi gras) where the main character dons a blue bikini and wings and is told to shake her booty on a parade float.  At this point my daughter asks &#34;mommy why is that lady going out in her underwear?&#34;  The other underlying theme is the bird being unable to fly, something he needs to learn to do by using his heart and not his head.  Good point, but that concept was way over the head of the little kids.  On a positive note, the animation was cool and the kids enjoyed the variety of tropical birds, the soundtrack would have been awesome if it wasn't accompanied by all the club style dancing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Impatiently awaiting season 4! I LOVE this series and can't wait until next year! Also, I was happy to see Shirley Maclaine play Cora's mother and hope to see her again in future episodes. Great season though it was sad so have a kleenex handy if you get emotional!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Very few novels make me laugh out loud, but the Demille/John Corey combo is hard to beat.  Great story and good fun.  Highly recommend!
B003VXRD4E|5.0|A must have for those who love period pieces! I'm happy to have added it to my collection and will watch this movie again and again!<br /><br />Thanks!
B00000IQW5|5.0|We have enjoyed this film in the past and are now proud owners of our own copy.  really enjoy watching.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Another great rendition from Jackson and I can't wait for the release of the second movie! Bilbo is portrayed wonderfully, and I think Tolkien would have loved the movie!
B008LAO7C8|5.0|Too much to say. A mental dissection of a biblical nature. I don't think you can handle it. The darkest night and the fowlest of creatures lurking outside your tent that is slowly disintegrating in the acid rain. Droning complexity of emotions and pain in its purest audible form. An impeccable depiction of life in its heavily charred straight-jacket ripped and restitched innumerous times as frontman Michael Gira pushes the trite of existence to the wall, breaks through it and continues on to suck up the essence of the human eye-perceived universe just to hack it up and spit it out along with the sins and blood of a tortured youth before stomping it into the dirt with a steel toed boot then carrying on chronically kicking the shit out of it and grinning as he does. \\"A Piece of the Sky\\" may be one of the greatest songs ever written. Sinister genius. Blood lust. Compromising pain. Unintelligible sentiment. A brief portrayal of Hell. Not for the faint of heart, simple-minded, or content.
B008LA7RMK|5.0|This is the 1965 album when the band ( yes the band, not only Brian) hit its stride as artists. Brian composed and commanded, but over the course of several years of intensive concentration on their music, these guys had become greater than the sum of the parts. If you are intrigued by the Beach Boys' enduring influence, and don't have this album, get it.
0385349947|5.0|Part feminist manifesto, part practical guide for success, part personal memoir. Lean In is timely, honest, and spectacular.  It sparks thought, inspiration, and conversation--great for women and men!
0307272702|4.0|It sounded like this book might be dry reading, but I really enjoyed it.  I was interested in eating low carb and this book seemed to explain why eating this way was not bad for you.  Unfortunately I had some bad side effects that make it necessary for me to not eat the way the book says.  It was great for blood sugar and cholesterol as well as triglycerides, but my fluid retention was not a good thing.  Hope it works for others.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|This book is balanced, well written and insightful. I think it's a necessary read for anyone going into the corporate world. Rage against the corporate BS and be invested in achieving the future.
0345536886|5.0|One of the best legal thrillers I've come across. Grisham takes you into a small two-lawyer plaintiff's law firm to a big 100+ lawyers defense law firm and finally into the courtroom where a jury trial is as deeply engrossing as it possibly can. Going through these phases are characters full of life, who with their own habits and idiosyncrasies manage to weave the story into an interesting and thrilling quilt of great legal fiction. To me this book was a nonstop page-turner that I couldn't keep aside until I finished it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|WOW!!!!! I cant explain how awesome this game or app is. You will just have to find out yourself.<br /><br />P.S. Hint hint. awesome app. do recommend.
B0014NDXGA|3.0|I purchased this item to be able to accurately measure certain items on the golf course.  However, I have found that it is difficult to accurately point to items and get an accurate reading.  Additionally, I have measured certain objects and I get a yardage reading that does not correlate to yardage indicators on the golf course.  Maybe worth purchasing a slightly higher model of this item.
B00140PK6O|5.0|My wife is stuck on this particular genre and this was one of the better ones we have watched. Good price and fast shipping!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This movie reminds me of my college years. I spent many days & nights on the road & backstage with many bands. I didn't get a degree from the University. I got a degree in Rock N Roll :) So much of Cameron's story I relate too. This is my FAVORITE movie of ALL movies ever made. It makes me happy, it makes me sad !!
B002XTBEDI|5.0|My wife is stuck on this particular genre & this was one of the better ones we have watched. Good price and fast shipping!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|My kids and I find ourselves addicted to this game. The only complaint that I have is that is does sometimes freeze up and you have to get back out of it and start over.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I added it to my kindle fire he and love it.  It works much better on my kindle than it did on my phone.
B008602KQI|2.0|Wow, all this hype from my friends that have read the book and seen the movie. I was let down, the action is lame and the plot is ripped off a Japanese movie made in 2003 movie called \\"Battle Royale\\". Even worse, they put such a female spin on it. She goes around caring and loving everyone else even though they are supposed to kill each other.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Oh my goodness is this game addictive to say the least. First off the description didn't quite sum up the actual game however I am very pleased that I chose to download this.  My description would probably read something like this.  Around the world is a exciting conglomeration of a few very popular mind games such as.. bejeweled &amp; sudoku.  It starts out extremely easy and slowly the level of difficulty increases.  Soon you find yourself absorbed in moving ahead to the next level (country).  One tip.......make sure your chores are finished before you begin playing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I ordered the book to read before the movie came out and I did just that.  Loved the book very much.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The title says it all. Mr. Quick's ability to make the characters so real and relatable almost makes you feel like you should call Pat and Tiffany and congratulate them for staying in the fight to survive life's brutality. EXCELLENT!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I have not seen the televised version and now I will not.  There is no way it could equal the images this book put into my brain.  Why a four? The only book in the series that can earn a five is the final one if it ties all the others together.<br /><br />GRRM edited a series called Wild Cards that I also enjoyed.<br /><br />This book deserves to be read by anyone who enjoys high fantasy sprinkled with politics, sex, and humor.  Long may Tyrion Lannister bed whores!
B001HN6922|2.0|I'll admit I liked Cars, however I didn't like it enough to look forward to a sequel. Of all the sequels pixar could have made why cars 2. The movie is barley intresting as it is but making matters worse is the whole movie is focoused around Matter and not main character lightning Mcqueen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good when on a road trip or trying to kill time. Enjoyed the game a lot and it never gets old
0553801473|3.0|The fifth book of George R.R. Martin's fantasy series improves on the fourth which meandered a bit. The fact that Tyrion one of the most popular characters in the series was MIA in the fourth book meant that I was a bit less interested in the novel than the previous three. Tyrion returns in full force in the fifth book A Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />That isn't to say that there isn't some bloat here--A Dance with Dragons COULD have been trimmed and a good editor would have kept the story more on track here (something that was sorely missing from the previous book--keep in mind that that book and this one were originally planned as a single novel). Nevertheless, even with the padding the reintroduction of Tyrion and focus away from some of the lesser characters that dominated the previous novel helps Dragons in the long run.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Occurring concurrently with the fourth book, the fifth novel finds Jon Snow elected as the Lord Commander of the Night Watch although Snow continues to run into conflict from Janos Slynt who betrayed Jon's father and helped in his arrest.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|What an amazing story. I wasn't sure I knew what I was getting myself into when I started reading this book but I am so glad that I read it. The author did a tremendous job of getting both sides out. The complications of a quad were so well explained and how it would be understandable why a person would not want to live in this state, but it also tells why the people that love that person don't understand why he/she would not want to live. They see so much optimism where the quadraplefic doesn't. This was a sobering story and worth reading even though there are many sad moments. I look forward to reading other Moyes books

1601251505|3.0|I've been playing RPGs for over a decade, and been a DM/GM for about half as long. This is a great source book. The system is similar to 3.5, but much better as some of the more 'broken' dynamics have been removed, changed or improved upon, making it an overall more balanced and fun game.<br /><br />This book contains exclusively Rules. There's some fluff, but nothing that is specific about a campaign setting, which in my opinion is how it should be.<br /><br />It's designed for players and GM's, so it has EVERYTHING you need to start a game. Yup, that's right, a whole RPG in 1 book.<br /><br />The down side:<br /><br />It's big, real big, it has over 580 pages in a thick, durable, gloss print. Don't get me wrong, the books is gorgeous, but it's about twice the size of any other RPG book (in thickness, other dimensions are of a normal 11x9&#34; book).<br /><br />It's not bound. I thought that only my book had this problem, you know 1/100 factory defect, but after ordering several for my friends/players, I found out that it's a design flaw.<br />What does that mean?<br />The pages are glued, so there's no worry about them coming out, but the spine is not glued to the pages, meaning there's a gap between the spine and covers that may eventually (probably sooner rather than later with the kind of use these books get) make the entire thing fall apart. (splitting the covers and spine away from the pages)<br /><br />Every once in a while you'll get a bad book. One of the books that arrived was in terrible condition, it looked like a dog had chewed it, the spine had come off, the first page was damaged and detached, and the corners (all of them) were frayed and worn.<br />I decided to keep it, since I knew I could fix it and it had character. BUT This is NOT ACCEPTABLE for a $50 ($35) book.<br />The reason this happens, is because Paizo, sometimes will sell play-test copies at lower prices (50-70% off, depending on condition), these are books and materials that have been used, dropped, play-tested with...etc. It's a rare occurrence that this would get mixed in with the 'new' materials, but it does happen. (If it does, return it, DO NOT OPEN the plastic wrapping it comes in) If it does not come 'new' and perfectly square in a nice plastic wrapper, Return it Immediately for exchange.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the game, the books and the experience of Role Playing. This is a great RPG that veterans and beginners love.sed, dropped, play-tested with...etc. It's a rare occurrence that this would get mixed in with the 'new' materials, but it does happen.

1575666286|5.0|Book makes absolute sense.  But so does Nourishing Traditions and so does Practical Paleo.  Problem is, which one do you use?  Paleo is opposite of Gerson Therapy in that it pushes fats and protein and foods one would eat in a non-industrialized society.  All three push NO PROCESSED FOOD!  Gerson pushes fruits and vegetables, no protein or fats.<br /><br />I guess if one had cancer, I would certainly go the Gerson Therapy method as it is tried and true.  If good general health already, then switch to Paleo to keep the health, which in my opinon is a stepping stone to the ultimate Nourishing Traditions.<br /><br />Problem with the Gerson Therapy book, 30 pages are missing.  pages 297 - 328 are missing, and 329 thru 360 are repeated.  Someone goofed in the printing office!

1616614609|5.0|If you do a little research on the company website, or better yet peruse through boardgamegeek.com you'll be able to follow the history of this great game.  Having played the original but not being able to afford multiple collectible card games (CCG) during its inception, FFG has done an incredible job putting this game back out to the public.<br /><br />Netrunner in a nutshell is a 2 player asymmetric card game that involves strategy and bluffing.  Players pick from different factions that favor a style of play heavily and in advanced rules allow you to tailor your preferences by mixing them up.  The game is asymmetric in that one player as the &#34;Runner&#34; has different cards and actions than the &#34;Corporation.&#34;  The former requires more agility and flexibility while the latter requires forethought and bluffing.<br /><br />The Living Card Game (LCG) concept takes a lot of the headaches out of this style of game which has otherwise limited good designed older games from seeing the play it deserves.  Essentially, LCG's give you everything you need to play and keep the pool of cards limited to whatever the buyer is happy with playing.  Compared the CCG's which function on rarities like a pack of baseball cards, it takes alot of resources to get a finely tuned set of cards to play the exact way you want.<br /><br />POSITIVES<br />-integrated neatly into the Android background without losing its Cyberpunk origins<br />-way easier learning it than I remember and far less frustrating than the original &#34;starter decks&#34;<br />-plays faster than before, we were able to try all 7 factions (3 Runner, 4 Corp) decks in a little more than 2 hours<br />-contents and art are slick and fit the themes and game mechanics well<br />-very tidy, factions are colored and numbered so you can break down the decks quickly<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />-giant box for small row of cards without an insert- as a stand alone, you'll be holding the entire stack of cards easily in one hand so the packaging was a little off, however as you add more story packs, you'll fill up the box easily, but it would really benefit from a vacuum molded liner<br />-definitely not good for younger players for rules and mechanics reasons, but I would never discourage them from trying it.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />-one stop shop with custom future add ons<br />-does the job better than the original and that's saying alothand so the packaging was a little off, however as you add more story packs, you'll fill up the box easily, but it would really benefit from a vacuum molded liner<br />-definitely not good for younger players for rules and mechanics reasons, but I would never discourage them from trying it.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />-one stop shop with custom future add ons<br />-does the job better than the original and that's saying alot
0195117298|5.0|A good book will always push you a bit to think of concepts you may have not explored yet.  This is one book that will do just that.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a wonderful book about ordinary people, with seemingly ordinary lives, but with significant personal challenges.  About \\"us\\" really.  Being a US reader, I found the description of life in pastoral Ireland charming (I didn't know Rice Crispies and Campbell soup were sold in Ireland) I hope the author writes more.  I was disapointed however, at how quickly the author ended the climax of the book.  I think she could have devoted a few more pages to it; I was by the end of the book invested in the characters and would have enjoyed a little more description of the final scene; a minor failing, but the only reason I didn't give five stars.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|The movie was alright but the picture quality sucked. The previews made the movie look like there would be great cinematography but the quality amazon streams is lame so the picture was blurry and washed out.

B00AFROVQC|1.0|There was nothing in this book that I liked, I felt it had all been written before. The hero was uninspiring and the character's physical and emotional descriptions were non events. It was hard labour to read but I perservered to the end to see if it improved any. Sadly this was not the case and I'm not inclined to buy the next book just to see if this was a one off catastrophe.

B008B68J2G|4.0|This is one of those products that my daughter tore open immediately, and it has seen heavy rotation in our home's playing cycle over the past week.  It's a great tie-in with the new Scaris film that the kids just watched recently, and it's reinvigorated Monster High play in our house.  A brief bit about the categories here:<br /><br />Fun - The cafe scores well in this category.  As I mentioned, the whole popularity of Monster High has jumped with the introduction of this product.  It gives the characters something more to do, and adds to the storytelling element for my girls.  The Parisian setting (for those who watch the film) is something different for them to consider.<br /><br />Education - I don't think the kids are learning a huge amount from this, perhaps other than what it might be like to run a cafe or food cart, or how to lounge around.  Not something I'd recommend if learning is the main concern with a purchase.<br /><br />Durability - The parts are fairly well-constructed, although not really enough to justify the price tag.  Some of the smaller pieces (eg. the snack holders) are likely to be lost, which is always the downside of smaller accessories.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is an excellent product that will no doubt appeal to all fans of the Monster High franchise.  The product itself likely isn't enough to justify the cost, but it's more than worth it when you see how much it adds to the play experience.
B005LAJ23A|2.0|Season 2 was a severe disappointment after the mostly focused story-line of season 1. I'm not a fan of horror or zombies in particular, but I wanted to watch the show because I do like the post-apocalypse genre. To be clear, I expected a lot of drama before I began watching season; but drama is only good when it makes sense. The short version of why I didn't like season 2 is this: the characters are all over the place. Maybe two or three are well-written and don't do things that make no sense, but there rest are just vessels through which the writers of the show like to squeeze out as much melodrama as possible, irritating me in the process.<br /><br />From about episode 2 on, I was bored. I don't need action to keep me paying attention, I need a focused narrative, and characters that do and say things that make sense...for their character. For the most part, it seemed to me that whenever the writers didn't know what to do, they would just have a character do something stupid, which would create a problem that doesn't add anything to the story. And that's how most of season 2 felt. Like there were two or maybe three things that were driving the story forward, and everything in between was just filler. I think it was seven or eight episodes in and the Sophia being lost in the woods story arc hadn't even been finished. By that point it seemed like her mom had already moved on, and didn't particularly care about finding her. Sure...I mean whatever. If she's not going to care, I don't care.<br /><br />And that's how I felt even throughout season 1. I don't particularly feel attached to any of the characters. Glenn is probably the strongest character, and the one whom doesn't do very many things that don't make sense. But I'm watching each episode just kind of passing the time, being bored through most of the drama because almost nothing happens in most of the episodes. We have to drive five minutes into town to go get Herschel, we'll be right back. Cool. Five hours later, the short trip has inevitably been turned into the entire episode, and then the pregnant woman decides to go off to rescue them on her own because obviously whatever is holding them up is something she can deal with. But of course she crashes her car, thus creating even more drama. And I'm sitting there just like...who cares? I don't care about any of these people because none of them are consistent. In a survival story you have to care about the people who are trying to survive. But everything is just a long argument that ultimately never gets resolved.<br /><br />I'm not saying that everyone should just work together happily. No doubt in a real-world scenario people would argue with each other and there would be drama. But I don't need eleven episodes of it. The Walking Dead is about a zombie apocalypse, but it shouldn't be about a zombie apocalypse. It should be about what comes after. How people collectively can regroup and decide how best to try to live. There are morality questions that are amateurishly addressed. The show should be poignant, offering up questions without actually having to ask them, and making the viewer wonder not just how they would feel in that characters' place, but about their own morality in the world we actually live in. These are things that have been awkwardly handled so far, and if I'm going to keep watching it needs to change.<br /><br />That said, another problem is some of the casting choices. Carl, the main protagonist's son, is horrible. Excuse the pun, but he can't act to save his life. And it doesn't help that whomever is writing the dialog for him clearly has no idea how an actual 13 year old speaks. Many (I'd say most) shows suffer from this, and it's not easy writing dialog for a very young person, but if that's the case his dialog should be kept to a minimum. It's laughably bad, and he ruins almost every scene he speaks in. I guess he's really the only actor I have a problem with, the rest I can chalk up just to the sub-par writing.<br /><br />All that negativity said, the season had a few high points. Without spoiling anything, it is finally revealed what Jenner told Rick before they left the CDC, and the Sophia story-line was completed in a way that made me respect the show more, though by that point I was extremely bored and irritated at all the pointless bickering. I can only hope season 3 is better. If it's not, I won't continue watching.b-par writing.<br /><br />All that negativity said, the season had a few high points.

Will Joss and Fox follow suit and figure out a way to finish what it started?  Rumors always abound, so one can hope.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Absolutely loved this show (despite the mangled Mandarin).  If you've not seen it, give it a shot.  It's worth it.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm not into werewolves or vampires or...zombies, but Max Brooks' story was a great read!  The story is chilling, a global calamity. But Brooks' strength is really in the telling, presenting the Zombie War in all its aspects from dozens of viewpoints which give the reader a feel for how the war looked and felt to presidents, generals, grunts and civilians. World War Z is a great read--the pages practically turn themselves!  Brooks is a craftsman!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Coming into the movie, I wasn't sure what to expect.  As a kid, I spent most of my time outdoors.  I can count on one hand how many times I've touched a comic book, and most of those times were to roll them up, and use them as an imaginary sword.  I'd never seen any of the accompanying movies either.  So, naturally, I figured I'd be completely lost throughout the entire movie.  The first time I watched it, I was.  I had no idea who was who, or what they were trying to accomplish.  To be honest, I didn't enjoy it.  If it weren't a part of a school project, I probably wouldn't have given it a second chance.  So, I watched it again.  After watching it a second time, I picked up things that were initially missed, and ended up enjoying a movie that I never thought I would.<br /> The movie starts with Thor's brother, Loki, finding his way to Earth with the objective of stealing a renewable energy source called \\"Tesseract\\".  The Avengers are called to save the day in classic comic book fashion.  Hawkeye was initially assigned to guard the Tesseract.  A portal opened, and out came Loki.  Loki manipulates Hawkeye, along with Dr. Selvig using his magical staff/spear-looking thingy, makes off with the Tesseract, and the Avengers are assigned with the task of retrieving the Tesseract, and bringing Loki to justice.  That proves to be quite a difficult task.<br />  There are points during the movie that each of the heroes butt heads with each other, making it difficult to accomplish their task.  Evidently playing well with others isn't part of a super hero's genetic code.  It takes the \\"death\\" of one of their own to bring them together as a team.  As a team, they prove to be unstoppable.  The Hulk smashes stuff.  Ironman is the billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist that doesn't work well with others.  Hawkeye eventually gets out of his funk (with the help of a face smashing by Romanoff).  Captain America reminded me of a younger, stronger, and better looking version of mygrandpa.  He looks at the world with the eyes of an 80 year old, but has the abilities of a 20 year old.  Thor was also interesting, to me.  You could tell at the beginning of the movie that he was a little conflicted with the assignment he'd been given.  You could tell that he wasn't thrilled about having to bring his own brother to justice, but, did it anyway because he knew that it was the right thing to do.<br /> All things considered, I enjoyed it.  It caught my attention enough to watch the other movies associated with it. That may lead to me appreciating The Avengers more than I already do.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|I liked the movie but a little dark for Disney. I only have a few Halloween movies fun to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the best running game ever. This is so so fun. It [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]is very easy well Don parts. That's why I love subway surfer.<br /><br />-Ayanna
B000FC1MOQ|3.0|I loved the way it was written and the story. Didn't this author and publisher ever hear of autobiographical fiction?  Great but not great.
B00BFTV09K|5.0|These kinds of titles are popping up everywhere and this is the first I've read. It was enough. I haven't been able to look at food the same way since. I've always instinctively felt the need to prepare as much of my children's food myself. Lamenting the cost both in time and money it takes to prepare &#34;scratch food.&#34;<br /><br />I could never go without the convenience of the fast food lifestyle, but last week I made the decision to make my own nori rolls and pack dinner for my kids and myself rather than give in to the temptation of the drive thru window.<br /><br />This book should be part of the school curriculum, most kids given the info would accept that fast food in all its deliciousness should be treated like any other lolly (candy to you americans) and enjoyed sparingly.<br /><br />Great book and sure to stimulate many a family discussion. All that delicious processed stuff has consequences.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have enjoyed being able to relive my childhood by having these horses. Its also been fun looking at everyone else's horses too.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|The book makes me look at US history through a completely different filter. Well written; well cited; and filled with thought provoking fact. The reader may not like the reflection they see in the mirror after reading this book.
B00013RC66|5.0|great to be able to find such a great cult classic, Theresa Russel did riveting job of keeping one on the edge of their seat. The movie was sent in a very timely matter. I received before I could walk to the mail box., was in mint condition,

B0071XO8RA|4.0|A good read. A plausible scenario though at times a bit weak.<br />You do want to find out what will happen in the end.
0802473156|1.0|This is a case of not reading the description of the book... I just looked at the title and ordered... soo, I kept the &#34;little&#34; book as a reminder to READ the description... don't just look at the picture.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We love the series. There have been some shows that we missed and we hope to catch up with this series.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I looked that the board changes with every game, it keeps the games interesting and challenging.  I am enjoying this version of the game and look forward to future upgrades.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was amazing, a joy to read, and I have shared with many friends, family, and coworkers! Hoping for a continuation!
0385349947|5.0|This book is chalk full of statistics and personal stories, I could hardly put it down. As a young women in the workplace, I could relate to many of the examples and was encouraged by the recommendations for what to do in various situations. Sandberg is witty and made me laugh. She is such a phenomenal role model. Read the book!
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Do not, I repeat do not buy this. I can't believe after all the complaints and returns, season three discs are STILL not working!!!! Absolutely frustrating.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Gives current temp and expected temp for each hour. Gives brief overview for the next week.<br />I give thi review system one star, can't save and move on.<br /><br /> I give
B00884GR0W|1.0|Graphics are so-so, controls are crap, is there even a point to this game? I'm glad I got this for free because it is worth nothing in my opinion. It made my \\"remove from cloud\\" list.
0857685848|5.0|The pictures in this book are gorgeous and they totally riveted my 12-year-old grandson's attention. It was an excellent choice for a birthday present.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Very happy.  DVD arrived in perfect condition.  Plays well.  Detailed chapter listing making it very easy to stop and come back later.
B004WR125O|5.0|Very easy to connect, great connectivity throughout the house.  Doesn't lag or buffer much.  Once installed, can easily using iphone to controll the amp.  Read numerous complaints about this product, I have not experienced any of those issues.  So far, everything is working flawlessly.
B00402FGE4|4.0|I'm enjoying the series (again) and the dvd's are in good condition.  No skips or scratches.  But the episodes are not divided into chapters which makes it harder to come back to your place if you can't watch the entire episode at one sitting.  Overall I'm very pleased.
0307460444|4.0|Good range of cupcake recipes. Some are a little out there but will be interesting to try. Some of the ingredients are a little &#34;special&#34; and not too common. A treasure hunt to find, but hoping once I find them they will be that extra yum in the recipe.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This is a really entertaining game for kids and it gives them a little challenge. Just be careful about how much time you allow your kids on it because it is really addicting. Also, they need to interact with other kids so they dont become anti-social.<br /><br />The only reason I got this game was because it was the free app of the day on my device at one time. I wouldn't recommend buying it. You would be wasting a dollar.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Even though we had to convince my son and daughter to watch this (it was initially a little scary), my son has watched this a dozen times since we received it. He loves the movie!
B00BVVA138|5.0|Well worth the wait for long time KSE fans, or a great way to get into them. You need this in your ears. Jesse rips.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|What I expected and was looking for.  Thanks for making if possible.  I would definitely use you again in the future.
B00005N6KG|1.0|The cord is way to short for me have to keep it in my shirt pocket to listen to my phone. Very flimsy and sounds cheap.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I am always seeking to find out when it will air on cable.  Now, I can look at the movie at my leisure!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This is the best TV show on! I love watching it all at once, I rather wait till the DVD comes out than watch it weekly. That way I can control the times I watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome thank you Kiloo for making such a great game if you like temple run this is the game for you plus you don't have to tilt at all good for long car rides so the moving of your car dose not interfere with your game.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I play this alot, not sure if I really even know how to play it, but it's a great fill in if you just need some diversion and want something to do besides just watching tv.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is awesome! Its fun its free and its a great way to kill time. This is a definitely good game to get. Come on you know you want to.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead keeps your engagements and attention. This TV show is full of suspense. It's  well directed and nicely written.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|If you have not seen Game of Thrones yet you do not know what you are missing. It has to be the best series made in a very long time. Season 2 lives up to the what Season 1 started. An epic adventure with characters you will love and others you will hate with a passion. This show is a must see.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|is not worth a hoot... never could get it to work. It does not do what it claims to do
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|Horror story alright. Glad that's not my family. What a great show, it's got everything that horror fans love, see it now.
B005LAIIFS|4.0|But beware:  One of the two Hopping Eggs would not hop so don't count on making two kids happy with the toys.  They were free so I guess I can't expect more.
B0040YFR1Y|1.0|I purchased this item expecting to receive a code to unlock the digital copy for iTunes... when I got it it did not have the code insert inside ...DUMB!!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great series, makes you think allot about what you would do. Is the bad guy a bad guy??? Not to happy with the season finally though, could have been more dramatic or unpredictable.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|As always, George R.R. Martin left me hanging. This time even more so because this book only covers half the characters. The next book in the series covers the rest! Now I'm off to buy it!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Don't let \\"zombie\\" turn you off of this series. I love that not everyone here gets a happily-ever-after because it makes the show less predictable. The Governor needs to go. He plays a great part and we all love to hate him... but I'm ready for a new antagonist.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Watched the movie several times.They certainly made this movie move from start to finish. They did a great job keeping in sync with the flair we have come to like about the L.O.T.R. series. Can not wait till the next installment of The Hobbit!!!
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl had me gripped from the start.  It runs on parallel lines to modern day murders as soon on TV all too often.  Towards the end it's a real page-turner and every guess I made about what was going to happen was wrong.  It is wonderfully written about nasty people -  the hero is well aware of his own faults;  the heroine is not!<br /><br />I would not recommend it whole heartedly for book clubs.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Fails to save edited photos. The app worked great for 6 months. I wouldn't recommend spending any money on this application until the issues are addressed.
076421120X|4.0|I absolutely love reading and discovering new devotionals. It is a great way to gain different perspectives on a particular passage of scripture. Revealing Jesus by Darlene Zschech is the latest devotional that I have picked up. You may be familiar with Darlene from her popular worship song, \\"Shout to the Lord.\\" She has a companion CD, with the same name, filled with scripture that can tie the reader's heart and mind to this book.<br /><br />In Revealing Jesus, an attribute of God is highlighted each month and is carried out in the daily readings. Each day, Darlene focuses on a particular passage of scripture. I love how she utilizes various translations throughout the book. After the scripture, she gives a brief devotion that shows how the scripture is applicable in the reader's life. Each day, Darlene closes with a short prayer.<br /><br />I love this devotional and would highly recommend it. Each one can be read quickly, but profound enough to stay with you throughout the day. It ties everything together - digging into God's Word, applying it to our lives and prayer. Wonderful read!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|very difficulte to use. jumps to the top when you back out of a posting and will not give a friends complete list
B005IQZB14|4.0|I liked this book !  Very honest and well written...with a pace that made an otherwise strange hike with stranger motives very interesting and worthwhile.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|The book is really good. I would suggest you give it a go. I could not stop reading it, and now I will continue with book 2!!! :)
B004GJYROG|5.0|We had a great purchase and transacting. Came fast and well packaged we will purchase again and let others know. thanks again.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|It charges sometimes and sometimes not...not sure if it's the cord or the kindle.  It has to be set in there just right for it to charge fully.
0545265355|5.0|These books are truly amazing.....sooo unique compared to everything else out there! If you haven't read the books but saw the movie, I would highly recommend that you read the books asap!! My little brother is currently borrowing mine because he loved the movie and had to see how great the books were :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider solitaire and all the other solitaires too!!! They can keep you occupied for hours or days. Ha ha. I have, too. I love the fact that these games are now electronic and will never grow tired of them.
B00BGIC4I6|1.0|The trailer for this movie looks hilarious!! This movie has no plot. I still have no idea what it was about. It's depressing, offensive and stupid. Seriously not worth purchasing there are tons of other movies worth renting!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app for everything, the calculator makes it very easy to use. the buttons are simple and nothing is complicated ......
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The ad stated that this could be used on the regular kindle...it cannot ..so I wasted a bit of money...

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Cut the rope experiments is way better than the first cut the rope and it is very exciting and to see what wacky level is next
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is a must watch if you like the series. A bit more fast pace than season 2 with a ton of cliff hangers. The writers did a wonderful job. I can't wait to see what happens in season 4.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Not the first or the newest, but the best. The standard by which all others of the genre should be measured. Thanks Max.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Even if you aren't enjoying your favorite hallucinogen, this is great.  This is certainly a classic of its generation.  Highly recommended.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was great. What a subject, knowing that you have terminal cancer.  I'm so glad the kids have support groups.  I can't imagine how hard this life would be.
B00992CF6W|3.0|the price needs to be $0.99 that would be grate and you will get more buys so poses lower the price
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Too bad Andy Whitfield (Spartacus) passed away...he was a great actor!!!<br /><br />Altogether, great series!!!! A must see!!!<br /><br />Lots of action!! And a great storyline!!!
B004V6MWFU|5.0|If you like Eddie Vedder post Pearl Jam then this is an awesome CD.  Very Haiwian & chilled music to relax to.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is awsome y  sire you have to evolve but that's what makes it fun just get it is amazing  plus it's free!!!!!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Like others have mentioned I had to wonder just how a diary written by a guy that was stuck on Mars could be anything but boring.  Fortunately it turned out to be a great read that I highly recommend!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Every flynn novel starts with action. I love knowing the characters from book to book. 60% thru the book even tho it's tax season for me!
B001C34HUS|5.0|This book has some general principals for generating ideas. Its stuff I'd seen before so this was a nice concise refresher.
B000JMKNV0|3.0|I was entertained and hooked all the way through this book, however, I really disliked the ending. The ending was rather disturbing as a parent, but more so, it was not fulfilling at all.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This one just kind of dragged.  I wanted to read it to say I did.  The book was well written, but I wouldn't call it entertaining because it was too dark.
1619691884|3.0|I liked him better on TV. His writing I found too &#34;bookish&#34;--lots of complex sentences and convoluted constructions. (I'm a professional writer myself.)<br /><br />Hitchens' voice recording also gave me problems:  It was all exaggerated highs and lows, very few in-betweens: &#34;bup-bup-bup-bup-BOOM!&#34; or &#34;BOOM-bup-bup-bup-bup.&#34; It can be a lovely English cadence to listen to, but I couldn't get iPhone's equalizer setting to dial it in. (Yes, I have had my hearing checked and it's fine.)<br /><br />If you're willing to struggle with these features you may be rewarded with good content. I was surprised and disappointed to conclude that, for me, it wasn't worth the effort to dig it out. I would have been pleased if Hitchens had written more the way he spoke.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|very nice way to wake up. not too brutal and not to soft. You can make your own adjustments. totally cool basic and to the point.
B00004T9UF|5.0|No one is ******* with Em in this rapping thing. Wordplay is crazy! Easy Classic must own! Too bad Kim didn't make it lol.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|It's an easy date movie, and certainly a subject that hasn't been overdone.  Great singing too!  Wouldn't pay more than $4
B00BDSRKHO|4.0|I really like this OMD album. To my ears, it doesn't sound as though they've moved on at all in the 30-odd years since Enola Gay first stood me on my ear - which is just fine by me. The synth and vocals sound remarkably similar to those on Organisation, and there is a fine mixture of tuneful and more spiky tracks.<br /><br />English Electric struck me as a bit like a trip back to my twenties. Metroland is a great, straight-down-the-line electropop dance tune (with the prominent drum track sounding rather more like a Vince Clarke production) that I could have been dancing to in 1982. Helen Of Troy has echoes of Joan Of Arc. Kissing The Machine is a haunting tune featuring a breathy female voice speaking German and hinting at both Visage's Fade To Grey and The Mobiles' Drowning In Berlin...and so on. There are some intelligent and thoughtful lyrics throughout the album, too. In between the tuneful songs are some voice and effects tracks hinting at a dystopian future. As with some parts of albums of old, these are great for a listen or two, but now I've heard this album a few times I find I'm grateful that these days that I no longer have to get up and physically move the stylus in order to skip tracks.<br /><br />This is OMD doing what they do best and doing it very well. If you like that then you'll like this album. An unmitigated classic? Probably not - but it's a very good album with some cracking songs on it and I'd certainly recommend it.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|These Bond movies are so formulaic .  Big chase scene in the beginning.  Playing in the Casino in the middle with another fight, and of course the big finality.  Everything blowing up in the end, and James Bond walking away.  Also how does a guy with a little snub nosed pistol, take out the guy with the machine gun?
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Could have explained a couple of small things better to make it clearer as to why something was important, but overall did a really good job on the story line.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really has an ensemble cast that is great, but Maggie Smith stands out for being stiffly funny but isn't a caricature as she develops into a person who has rules of etiquette,etc. but when the need to be broken, she does it and it makes her character human and not cartoonish. And of course the other actors are great with interesting storylines..
B00785P2QC|5.0|Hasn't frozen or shut down so I'm good on that. The only thing I wish was that the file wasn't so big. It takes up a lot of space on the kindle fire. When or if it does I will repost a new comment.
B003FSTN7A|5.0|I loved this series and was sad to see it go when it did. I would recommend it to anyone that likes crime/paranormal type shows. It will surely keep you interested.
0679805273|5.0|I gave this book to my kids when they graduated from High School, now we are giving it to our grand kids.  Great fun!
B00B1E6FF8|1.0|1. First this is a very slow and boring movie, I would rather watch paint dry.<br />2. I was very confused by what was the point of the movie's portrayal of torture. The fact is that torture did not play any role in bringing Bin Laden to justice. In fact it is very clear that torture is counterproductive and was a hinderance to our attempts to find Bin Laden.<br />3. Most of the painstaking CIA work that led to Bin Laden's capture is just not covered and/or lost.<br />4. What was the point of this movie? Not exciting. Not analytical. Not anything other than a very boring and confused rewrite of history--if they were going to make it up couldn't they at least make it fun to watch?<br />5. The Obama clips are just a very crapy and petty way of trying to imply his politics and policies slowed the hunt for Bin Laden when the truth is just the exact opposite. Did turdblossum fund this movie?<br />6. The first 30 minutes of this movie seems like a deceptive attempt to justify torture in some way. How the characters accept torture as a necessary evil without question and without compassion towards their victims [who in the real world are mostly mistaken identities and random innocents turned in due to some grudge of the local (pakastani type) police playing us for a fool] is disturbing and is just a big rewrite of history; nobody believes torture is a good idea. Torture is about as immoral and unamerican as you can get. Perhaps even worst is that torture doesn't even work; the overwhelming evidence is that torture does not work, period. Where the writers of this movie just a bunch of fools or sadists?<br />7. I found this movie to be mostly unwatchable ...<br />8. This could have been a great and exciting movie--I guess I will have to wait untill the reboot---JJ Abrams where are you when we need you?
B008AITJ24|5.0|My daughter loves this series, I put this in her Easter Basket as a gift from the Easter Bunny.  They are never to old for a little fun.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Game of Thrones don't need to say any more.<br />Good read, need a name chart to keep track,<br />would be a great summer read
B0088O11NU|4.0|something to do when you need a break from reality! easy and entertaining for the whole family.  keeps you busy.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game for killing a few minutes. Also helps me unwind some after work. Only thing that annoys me is the tilt control can feel a little awkward granted that could be because I'm not used to tilt games so I use the touch controls.
1616550414|5.0|Every gamer particularly a Zelda fanatic should have this 'bible' if you will. It's beautifully made, rich with color and story, lots of great artwork and understanding timelines.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Anothesr games that was brought up on my new kindle that is enjoyed by a few of our grandchildren when they are here.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|You can't just play the game, the producer's want you to go to Facebook to let everyone know how your doing.  I don't want to go to Facebook or any other on line source, I just want to play the games and be done with it.  It also takes eight (8) minutes for a new game to load.  The game is fun but too much time wasted on waiting.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have not played this game yet. Our grandson got it on my new Kindle Fire, and seems to enjoy it a lot.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Love the game, it's quick and fun.  You get one minute to meet or exceed your last score.  It's fun and fast - keep these kind of games coming.
B009RWRIZ2|5.0|You must see :).  The dancers are incredible, the locations both inspiring and entertaining, the soundtrack compelling, and Pina Bausch's work will stir you deeply in your guts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love to take care of my horse I love to feed my horse I love to clean the staybl.

0307716988|5.0|Good book- insightful into his life and outlook on life.<br />Wish there was a part two - later on in life.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Every time this came on t.v, I could not stop watching. Now I can watch when ever, and the Blue ray makes it even better, bonus stuff too.
B005ER6STG|5.0|This movie sticks to your brain- it makes you think and feel so bad for this family.<br />Not for wiener kids.<br />Only problem with this Blu-Ray copy is that they took out a very small section that was probably one of the sickest parts.<br />I still have my DVD though so its ok.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Spectacular 3d.  Excellent story. All around a five star event. You can see why it was nominated for so many oscars.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Used to play it alot, but there are more games so I don't play it as often.  I'll get back to it.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|It was fun to see how the familiar characters had aged. For the most part the story line was a fun adventure. The ending did not come as a surprise, but was fitting.
1596434252|5.0|This is a beautifully stylish ABC book that captivated my husband and me as well as our 2 year old. I don't think I've ever come across as creative a pop up, one in which the letters do not necessarily simply pop but also shift and transform. We first picked this book up at a library and it was obviously new as all of the letters were intact unlike most library pop ups and what was more amazing was the respect our two year old gave this book. He did not once attempt to damage a letter which is impressive and certainly speaks highly of the book. I agree with a previous reviewer that this is a book for all ages. I can be enjoyed by kids learning their ABCs as well as adults with an appreciation of good design and whimsy.
B00003CX8J|4.0|Fun , adventure movie. This is where it all started. Special XF are will done. Sometimes spotty, but interesting characters.
B005OK721G|3.0|There were almost 30 minutes of previews and that was not fine. I ordered a movie not previews. I cannot recommend this provider for all those out there ordering movies on line.<br /><br />This is my kind of moivie; it is what I was raised on in the good old days of black and white TV and movies.  Twisting plots, shootouts, and more sophisticated modern wit and yeah I liked it. I kept missing the movie's start on premium channels.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It took a bit to figure out the context of the story line, but in the end was worthh while. Recommend.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|although he has become musically far more interesting in his late age Dylan is not always the best singer of his own ballads. This fantastic collection showcases his music and poetry. Even his own contributions to this 4 CD set are brilliant. Don't miss this. It is a fantastic collection
B009VB7P6G|4.0|These are always worth watching. Good for girls or boys or adults. Visually pretty. Funny with stories that have  moral messages.

B00BGIC170|5.0|Think this movie will be especially funny to those in the demographic of the title.  Not quite as hilarious as Knocked Up but still a solid film with some great acting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the entire series after reading this first in series book.  I would highly recommend this book and the entire series.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Seriously, this series is outstanding. Rarely do I find a series that leaves me in suspense. Most are easily predictable, but I can honestly say that I don't know what to expect when I watch Sherlock.<br /><br />The only thing I can count on for sure is that I'm going to find the cases intriguing, Dr. Watson sympathetically adorable, and Sherlock himself just human enough to lure me into believing he cares.<br /><br />Good job, Brits! Great storytellers since the 1700s at least!
B000BYA5GO|5.0|All citizens should view this with the current restrictions that are being forced on the us populace Syria would not have an emerging democracy if not for characters like this or free from dictators worldwide
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|It isn't as good as last season, but it is still good.  The new characters aren't as interesting as the originals, but there are still plenty of last season's treachery to get you through it.
B00866H7SS|5.0|This is the first series Ive read since reading 50shades, loved it! Awesome book, would recommend to anyone having Ana and Christian withdrawals
0547884591|5.0|Timothy Ferris is a pioneer in explaining a new lifestyle paradigm for the 21st Century. His talent is thinking and living outside the box and showing others the way through this densely packed and well organized manifesto. He obliterates the old school assumptions of hard work in the industrial age of breath-holding until retirement. He proves that the technology and new models of commerce are ripe for those who inform themselves and take advantage of location independent business possibilities. Four Hour Work Week is an eye opener, a road map to a new world. I've read it several times and will continue to keep it close for a reference book as I pursue my journey to online new and mobile wealth.<br />I am more confident than ever before that I will succeed at my passion to live and work in DR Congo as a volunteer pediatric nurse. I needed to discover a business that I could pursue part time whether in America or in Africa. I have eighty children I want to clothe, feed and love. I will give them medical care and clean water. I will travel and teach other orphan caregivers to offer medical care to children. I will replicate my skills as I go. My project name is RN for Congo. And I can be contacted on Facebook and Twitter. Yes, I'm always networking. Thanks Tim for sharing your amazing talent with us.
B00AA0U05A|3.0|Has a nice sound but background music slightly overwhelms her wonderful sounding voice. Beautiful young woman with a nice voice.
B00985E3UG|4.0|This book is not only informative beyond all necessity, it underscores the idea that money, and of course ego, out weigh any public good. If only the companies, and scientists who have spent years perfecting &#34; faux&#34; food would have put that energy into finding a way to dispose of nuclear waste . . . or an economic way to turn salt water into drinking water so that food, (the real thing) could have been grown in desolate areas . . . or spent that time curing disease . . . oh that would have pissed of the pharmaceutical companies, so as the book stands, it looks like everything is quite normal in the world of uber-capitalism.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is brilliant. Simillar to the popular MOAB League of Legends, Heroes of Order and Chaos is action packed, strategy filled and is always ready to accept some new players and hand out some tips. The many different playable characters and different game modes make the game different every time you play.<br />I would reccomend playing on a Kindle Fire HD, Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy Note or any other samsung Tablet.<br />On smaller devices with less RAM (Ipod Touch, Samsung Galaxy SII/I...<br />have a bit of lag and connection problems, but that is to be expected.<br />Again, five stars. Keep the updates coming and I have a new favorite game.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|I saw The Usual Suspects in the movie theater when it was first released. Now, I watched it several more times courtesy of Amazon. Each time, I discover more subtlety, more intrigue. The plot centers around a group of criminals conned into doing a job for the legendary Keyser Souze (spelling?) who is no one to trifle with. Along with the way, they're caught up in overcoming their own demons even as they encounter new ones. But who's really pulling the strings. It's a challenge to reveal more without blowing the plot. Suffice it to say, the performances in this movie are nothing short of amazing. Then there is the direction. The director captures all the tension without slowing down the pace. He also reveals little things at a time, things you won't notice until you view The Usual Suspects at least two or three times. That's what makes this movie one to own. Watch it with your friends and see who figures it out first, and last. While there is some violence, it's in good taste, and not overdone. Nor are the few action sequences. This is a movie that makes you think. Those are the best kind and this is the best of the best.
B0090OW7J4|5.0|This is masterful stuff.  This guy really gets it right, with just the right tinges.  I listen to this in the car.  A lot.  Short trips to the store, long drives, commuting...and it gets better with every listen.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I was very happy with this movie Adam Sandler did a fantastic job! I was worried that this movie would be raunchy and full of inappropriate humor. But it was fantastic! wonderful story and very funny!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|a calculator with you....how cool is that?  large buttons, easy to use, enough options without scientific equipment.  it is just right.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Very well constructed, interesting story line. Kept me and my husband in suspense. If you love Batman you won't be disappointed
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Dr. Alexander's visions were just dreams and nothing more.  Unless I misunderstood, he never was actually pronounced dead so how can he write about heaven when he wasn't there?  Being in a coma is not the same as being dead.  I considered the book just so much psychobabble and nothing more.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It definitely makes me want to re-read it, and I don't usually do that! LOVED it! Had a wonderful story line and sort of reminded me of the movie......The Hangover in the beginning. But then turned into romance. ;)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Keeps you turning the pages until the very end.  So many surprising twists until the last page!  HIGHLY recommend! One of John Grisham's best!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watch each of the show from the beginning to the end , some not so excited and some excellent, always fun watching behind the pillow just in case the zombie attack , I think this show have the most realistic zombies ever , just to much but that is what make it different
B00BF11STU|2.0|I was eager to see the planning etc of this enterprise , and yet the torture scenes were so diffcult to watch because of their constancy and length ,it was too much. And therefore the real accomplishments of this mission were obscured by this strange slant of equating rendition with results. ? I loved Hurt locker because of its balance of &#34;reporting&#34; shall we say, .In Zero Dark Thirty, this balance was lost.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|what I saw was not what I expected, bad teddy bad , but that was a lot of fun , this movie is not for kids
B00BESM14U|2.0|Young people are tried at every moment by a confusing conglomeration of difficult choices. What is so disturbing about this film is that the main character , a sensitive nice young kid is thrust into the middle of all of this in a way that makes his growing up and dealing with these things particularly bleak. The acting and writing is superb, and Emma Watson is a doll, however one feels that the main character in falling for her is doomed , throughout the film so that it is an experience all the way through like pouring vinegar on a wound. Ah, but for the young people ,most of whom are nice ,thoughtful, and trying to make their way in the world. I find this picture of modern life, terrifying for just that sort of person.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Ok this is a look game update  but u can't get it home screen buttons up on kindle because it takes up the whole screen and the slide button isn't reachable unless u have toothpicks for fingers. Pretty frikn frustrating.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|This is a great family movie.  My 4 yr old loves it.  There is some adult humor in it and occasional bad language.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The concept is original, the characters unique. There is mystery enough to keep you reading. Just when I think I have something figured out, there is a twist.  Good job Hugh Howey.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Joss Wheldon has painted a future both plausible and revealing.  The adventure is pulse-quickening, the humor is laugh-out-loud funny, the plots are memorable and highly-quotable.  The characters and performances rock out loud and the captain is a kick-butt, morally-driven and lovable rebel without any luck.  Nathan Fillion's Mal makes the crew a family and the Serenity a home.<br />  What's not to like?  That there's not more!.....what the **bleep** were you thinking Fox?
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|My Razor Habu recently crapped out on me and I needed a replacement. Searching around amazon for something with expected features but at a great price point, I came across this. Initially I was hesitant as this is Anker's first gaming mouse. I needed something with macro mapping, high DPI and a decent amount of extra keys. I went ahead with the purchase. Once I received it, the software wasn't as plug and play as I had hoped. This was not so bad as it is easy to find the software on their website (it doesn't come with a disc). The software was actually quite nice and worked really well. The keys had the right feel for the &#34;click&#34;. All the buttons were responsive and didn't have a stickiness to it that my Habu did. The grip was a little strange at first but I quickly adjusted to it. The interchangeable weights is a feature that I am still toying with to get the right feel.
B0016OMFO8|4.0|Too bad there weren't more from the Traveling Wilburys.  I didn't like the tunes as much on this as on the 1st one, but still an enjoyable CD.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I've had Nerf blasters my entire life and this is by far the best one I've ever used.  The speed of the darts is incredible and you can unload a clip in a matter of seconds.  Advancing to the next clip is a little tricky (not as smooth as I'd like) but not too difficult.  You definitely will want extra darts and clips.  If you're serious about Nerf or just want to destroy everyone else in a Nerf war this is what you need.  It's definitely an unfair advantage, but completely worth it.  The accuracy is fairly poor, but you can shoot so many darts so fast that it makes up for it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I loved the explanation of how he grew up and the difficulty of SEAL training.  I am still amazed with the teamwork, selflessness and toughness of his team
B008GJV8BW|4.0|why isn't the star rating enough? I repeat why isn't the star rating enough I repeat why isn;t the star rating enough?
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love this show!! I am so glad if I miss an episode I can purchase them here instead of waiting for Netflix. The picture quality was great. No complaints at all.
B005K17RU0|3.0|latest version locked on radar map while I was scrolling location. locked on picture frame &amp; nothing including time would change it. kindle couldn't be turned off. l had to let battery run down to reset. l liked the previous free version layout better. totally disliked pay version; took it off device
B001D09OAI|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time!! The language is a little rough, but its a classic!! Must see!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time. My husband plays this game all the time. We try to bet each others score all the time. Its a great game to play on a road trip or when your bored. I just love it.
B001AFF25W|5.0|We received this as a gift and loved it.  There is always so much to do and this book helped me to understand that there is not always enought time to do everything but always enough time to do the important things.  I am okay with that.<br />It is written in an easy to read, understand, and implement format.  I passed the book on to our clinic team and they are loving it as well!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Excellent!! I would not have thought this series would interest me but I'm glad it did. If you can tolerate some violence the character development is fantastic. Hope Season 5 becomes free for Prime members.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|..that a classic Cary Grant flick is available via Amazon and in great condition<br />and on DVD!  What could be better?
B0031R5K8G|4.0|Seeing the world through the eyes of someone who is very different from you is really interesting. This is what this book does and it does it very well. It is short, simple, entertaining and yet thought provoking and even deep in some parts. The main character is very likable in some parts, but also extremely annoying in others, which also adds to the interestingness of the book. Recommended!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Matt Smith returns as the new regeneration of the Doctor.  It's hard to come on to the show after Tennant and Eccleston but Matt Smith plays the role very well.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is a an amazing book. I was really worried about how it would end. But it was a great ending.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Being a huge fan of the books, of course my love for the movies would carry over as well. Each movie is well made, follows the books beautifully and has never let me down in any way.  Absolutely loved this movie!
B005MLR6X6|1.0|To be so disrespectful of the arts, African American poetry or stage is unforgivable, film should be an art also.  Now, for sheer entertainment its worth watching your horribly written show with undeveloped characters and minute by minute cliches...but not at the expense of my respect for true art.  Goodbye \\"thegoodwife\\" you were pleasant for a while.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Got it for my son, he enjoy playing this and building groundwork on chess as he loves it as much as I do.
B000FA675C|4.0|I'm not sure what it is about this book. It is fast-paced, with likeable characters who aren't all perfect, and has a plot that keeps you turing pages. Perhaps it's popularity pre disposes me to rate it more harshly than it deserves? I am not sure.<br /><br />I can say that I have read this novel twice, and each time I struggled to leave the story alone when I had more free time. It's a real page-turner.<br /><br />Not recommended for Christian readers who can't separate works of fiction from assaults on their beliefs.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Good writing cannot mask a ridiculous story line.  Just as an example, and without giving away the plot:  a guy who is rich enough to own three houses (including a mansion in St. Louis's richest suburb and a Swiss chalet-inspired lake house on a private lake), who is socially competent enough to dine with friends every lunch at his country club, and who is good looking enough to be compared to a modern day Gatsby has been pining away for the main character for over 20 years, even though she ditched him abruptly at age 16 when they were high school classmates and even though she tried to frame his beloved mother for an assault she didn't commit.  The guy is so besotted with his teenage love, he has built a greenhouse dedicated to her favorite flower (Tulips!) and enshrined her high school tennis photo on his living room table.  For 20 years, he has regularly written her chatty letters (My golf game; my summer trip), and never once during the 20 years does she ever write back.  He then becomes the white knight in armor.  To say more would be to provide a spoiler, but it's downhill from here.<br /><br />Other plot twists are equally if not more implausible.  The author knows how to write and keep you turning the pages, but at the end of the day, you'll find yourself saying, \\"Oh, come on......\\"
B002J2PB10|4.0|A fun and campy movie with classic Tarantino diologue and action sequences. By no means his most artistic feat, but a lot of fun to watch!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 is amazing. It's a show that isn't afraid to kill off some main characters, which only lets the show grow better. Can't wait until October for the next season. This is a truly great show with a decent plot.
B004XKMZVK|5.0|Of Cinderella and now I can carry their music with me on my Kindle.  I've listened to them for years!  Timeless!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved the story but the ending really makes the story. It's incredible. I haven't read the book but I definitely will. The movie is so vivid and captivating.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Not just an animated movie for kids, this movie brings lots of laughs as it references video games of many years past. No language, some animated violence. Younger kids may have a few moments that they may not like.
B000FA675C|5.0|saw that it was free for a day - I own the paper back but now it's on my kindle too.
B00B7IJBUY|4.0|As a fan, it's on quality par with Bounce/Crush/Day and I have listened to it several times. Nothing as rocking as &#34;It's my Life&#34; but tons of guitar especially solos. Now that &#34;Comfortably Numb&#34; is the new &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34; we can hear it in &#34;Into The Echo&#34; (a bonus track). With recent group goings on we may learn to appreciate this one more as time goes on.
B00797MB0O|5.0|this is a great movie with great acting.  it's  a little dark but that's the best kind of humor!  if you can't relate to this movie on any lever then you haven't really lived.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wasn't sure if I would like it but once I got into I was hooked.  Finished this and almost done w book 2
B007V4LBLU|5.0|this is a wonderful movie with many layers.  if you wanted to you can watch it for the symbolism of every scene or a window into drug addiction, but I watch it again and again just for the characters and humor.
B008602KQI|3.0|It's a good thriller, but it's a little disturbing to see people are harshly ruled and have to entertain other people at the price of their lives.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Considering I have no extra time to enjoy a good book, it was heaven to make time to relax and follow the Hunger Games.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Awesome game, fun and very addicting. I strongly recommend this game to those how enjoy strategy and designing there own city.
B004OZZ624|5.0|Hmmm no spoilers ..... Pretty suspenseful and thought provoking. (i.e. would I be willing to do the same for a loved one.....???)<br />Would definitely watch again and recommend to friends.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Awesome game for kindle fire....very good graphics...tilt works great....I would recommend this to anyone...for free you can't beat this...awesome job creators
B00992CF6W|5.0|Need new update now if I don't get new updates I'll quit playing ok but you need to at least make the world's much bigger
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Well this is a really cool game but it like I can't make it talk which is really weird. I mean this is called Talking Tom. I have a kendle and I don't know we're to talk in.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|I read this to help a grandchild who is attending college as a freshman. His learning is somewhat difficult because audio is easier to understand than the written word.  If I read it, it allows for discussion.  Because I have never even played Atari, it was difficult.  I did think that there is definately a moral issue to be found, however, and I credit the teacher for finding a book for students that isn't a dry, classic, English-type novel.  Lots of imagination and I actually learned something  about gaming, terms, etc.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game. It is very faced paced. It is fun and interesting. It has cool graphics and I like that it changes from New York to Rio, etc. It is very creative and challenging.I like to play it.It can help pass the time.You should play this game, I recommend this game to everyone.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|The main characters' performances are excellent. The ongoing plot and most subplots are interesting. Some handling of gender, sexual and racial issues is outdated but it's kind of cool to see how things have changed in a relatively short time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The only thing bad about this book is the ending! I didn't want it to be over!! Its an amazing book and would recommend it to all women! Of age of course :)
0451228375|4.0|good read, but very long. actions and grammar not always consistent with the era of the book, but still enjoyed the story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A 5 Start I could not stop reading it!! Very good book for the older age, not really for the young eyes
B00009ZYC1|5.0|Not much can be said that has not. Funny family movie that has a lasting legacy for decades to come
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game has soo much to it! I download it, I play it, I get addicted! In my opinion it should be like $3 but Halfbrick is so nice, they make it free! Best game ever! If I could, I would rate this 20 stars.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Loved this game! Have to figure out how to deter the evil ones so that you can move on to the next level. Creative, challenging, and fun to play! Just wish the game was longer and had more sagas!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is indeed a very long read but with good atmosphere. Storyline and character building is outstanding. Recommend to read before watching the movie.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Does not work on the kindle Fire. Installed different versions...never worked trying to use my Jib Jab app. Also would not play certain You Tube videos...Waste of a download.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book reminds me of the first Grisham book that I read &#34;The Firm&#34;. A clever thriller that has a satisfying ending.
1407499238|5.0|Loved the narrator and loved the story. Makes you realize that love can conquer many things...True friends sometimes appear when you least expect them. Great story.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved it.  It had subtitles enabling  us to  understand the dialog  in the  awesome  series  much better. A wise purchase!
B0058W74UY|1.0|I wanted to install Flashplayer so that i could play movies, etc. It does not work. I can't even use my Jib Jab.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|OH MY!  THIS IS QUITE THE TENSES!!!!  Volbeat just brings it every time!<br /><br />For those unaware, Volbeat sounds as if Metallica were playing LONG Misfits covers.  'Nuff said.<br /><br />BEAUTIFUL STUFF!  BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!<br /><br />Volbeat will be touring this summer with Big Daddy Kane and The Fat Boys, so ROCK ON!
B0049J2BSM|5.0|cute movie worth buying. Its a real good movie, some kids find it is scary until they understand it. Nice movie'
B003162R7E|5.0|A fine compilation of unpublished performances, some of these are a surprise by departing from previous work. Jimmie had a lot more in him, a shame that he was taken before his time.
B003UESJF6|3.0|I wouldnt buy one of these, kinda boring. The little kids don't understand it much. It is just ok.Dont waste your money
B00957T6X6|3.0|The books are amazing - I won't bother to bore you with how I've spent many a long night up way too late reading about the warring families of Westeros. I will say that I wish this ebook set was packaged a bit better. It seems to treat all of the books as one big book, which I find makes it difficult to navigate between them to find a past reference or something.
B000FA675C|4.0|This book was very exciting with a great premise that any feminist would appreciate.  I enjoy the unique piecings of historical art and symbolism.
B001TW68P4|4.0|Three or four songs I didn't recognize (fillers or side B), but for the most part and enjoyable album/disc. Good sound quality. Upbeat tempos - ya gotta sing along.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|It moved slower than I expected. It was tedious getting to the best parts of the story line.  It could have been edited tighter to make a better story.
B00007KWHG|5.0|What can I say - they're the Four Seasons! Good compilation of songs, no wasteful fillers, clear sound. Should have ordered 2 'cause I'll probably wear out this one.
B008Q0AZVK|5.0|Loved the movie. Robert Pattinson is a great actor. Like this time period so made it that much better. great movie.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I was not certain of watching this series. It could have gone very wrong but the history channel presented a GREAT mini series!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway SURFER is freaking excellent. Luv the updates and th e overall world and country concepts with the dynamic graphics.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I have read the entire series of books. That being said I was impressed with how much of the books they were able to get into the series. It was very enjoyable to watch and I look forward to seeing more!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Fun and adventurous.. Love this game...you must try it...I may buy this game. It would be worth the money.Love building the communities...
B008N9AASC|5.0|Ron Fricke has done it again! Baraka is a classic and Samsara fits into that category as well. The cinematography is vibrant and dramatic. There are both disturbing and beautiful scenes displayed in the movie-- and it will leave you feeling well cultured. Samsara is a must see.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is really good in my opinion. But I just can't do online ever! Still though I highly recommend this game, it's not that Mindcraft: assassin's creed piece of crap.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|Out of all the Tolkien books this was my favorite.  The Hobbit was the shortest book of four.  The Lord of the Rings movies were excellent.  But the Hobbit is total disappointment.  It is only a veiled attempt at following the book.  It left a great deal of the book out and gave us characters that didn't appear in the book.  I can't imagine what he's going to do with the next two movies.  My advice, for those who haven't read the book do and for those who have, read it again.  And for everyone, don't waste your money on this film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the new hottest way to experience caring and training young horses. You can even get a unicorn or pegasus. The best part is you get free gems!!! Im only on level 6 and i have 163 gems and didnt have to pay for them!
030746363X|5.0|I'm from Belgium so I bought the book through amazon.co.uk and not .com (shipping fee is lower ;-) )<br />That's why I'm not certified as an amazon reviewer for this book.<br />----<br /><br />The 4HB (The 4-Hour Body)  is amazing.<br />WHY? First of all it has something for everyone.<br />- stop swimming backwards<br />- get some maintenance for your body<br />- eat as much as you want and a heck of a lot on FATurday<br />- it's information dense but if you want you can skip them and get the action steps and implement<br />-.....<br /><br />I keep going back to it and find new nuggets!<br />Tim plays the guinea pig so you don't have to.<br />Recommends safe choices.<br />Actually it's all best practices that are NOT common sense.<br /><br />I loved the 4HWW (The 4-Hour Workweek) , and I am still digesting the 4HC (The 4-Hour Chef)<br /><br />Normally this stuff is only for elite athletes and the super rich... Now it's for everyone<br />Thank you for bringing LIFESTYLE DESIGN to the masses.<br /><br />Pick Up This Book!
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a fun game but the constant goal prompts to like on Facebook .<br />and load a pic in Facebook is extremely annoying. I would just like to play the game.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I had no trouble finishing this book.  There was a lot of twists and turns and interesting characters.  The author blurs the division between groups... free/slave, good/bad, educated/uneducated...and explores different coping mechanisms for the struggles of her characters.  It is hard to read about people treating each other so inhumanely but sadly, the author did not invent slavery and abuse for this story.  Maintaining &#34;appearances&#34; was often justification for abhorrent behavior.  But, there were also instances of extreme selflessness and moral fortitude from those considered (at the time) less-human.<br /><br />I could not help but cringe at the number of times better communication could have resolved many issues.  This is what gave it the soap-opera feel for me.  Overall, I enjoyed the book but it would not make my list of all-time favorites.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Intriguing book you can not put down.<br />It was one of the best books that I have ever read! It was so good
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really liked this book. It full of exotic sex which at times was a bit too much however there is a story line. I enjoyed each character.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Bob Seger Rocks your face off in this all time greatest hits. Was well worth the money i spent on this.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I wasn't too eager to read this book at first. It was a book club pick.  I'm so glad I gave it a chance.  It took me a while to get into the story but eventually, I got to a point where I couldn't put it down.  Very unique take on Cinderella.  I can't wait to start Scarlet and see where the story goes.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|A very different type of book from my usual reads.  Had I been a football fan I may have enjoyed it more.  My opinion has always been that books surpass the movie, however, in this case, I'm voting for the movie.
1878424505|5.0|easy to read, concise, something you can take away with you and think about and apply it daily. its a read for over and over again.
B000VHXD7O|4.0|It was a bit on the draggy side here and there, but enough action and suspense before it climaxed to make it worth the time to watch.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|I wanted an app that allowed me to read as much as I wanted, when I wanted. This isn't the Bible downloaded, it's a series of Plans and you have to choose which ones you want to follow in order to read the text. Not what I needed, though terrific for those who just need a verse or chapter a day regardless of where it lands within the book.
B008220DGE|2.0|I loved Paul Thomas Anderson's \\"There Will Be Blood.\\" I figured with him at the helm, and great actors like Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Joaquin Phoenix, and Amy Adams in the film, what could go wrong? Apparently, plenty. The acting in this film is excellent and the characters are intriguing. The problem is with the plot and pacing. I was into it for about the first 45 minutes and then it lost me. A storyline which disappeared into thin air about halfway through, coupled with scenes that went on way too long made this a disappointing experience. I can't for the life of me understand why professional film critics rated it so highly.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|In the end, experience takes you everywhere and home is where your heart is...This little story is big with spiritual ideals and is a delight to read. Will leave you filling just a bit fuller and smiling as you turn each page. It does resemble St. Expery's Petit Prince with the alchemist's touch of religious tolerance and mature insights.
